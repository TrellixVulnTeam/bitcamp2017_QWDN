Jason Tremblay, age sixteen at the\n\ntime of the underlying events in this case, and his father, Richard\n\nTremblay, sued the Town of Conway, New Hampshire, its police\n\ndepartment, and Captain William McClellan.                    The suit asserted\n\nviolations of Jason's constitutional rights and pendent state law\n\nclaims arising out of his temporary detention under New Hampshire's\n\nprotective custody statutes.\n\n              That detention occurred when Jason and a friend were\n\npicked up by Officer McClellan during the early morning hours of\n\nSeptember 12, 1999, while walking along a major road just after\n\n2:00 a.m. smelling of alcohol; the police had been called earlier\n\nthat Saturday night to break up a nearby underage drinking party.\n\nJason and his friend were taken to the police station, and, a short\n\ntime later, Jason was brought home.                 He then took a family car\n\nwithout permission, picked up two friends, and drove to Maine. The\n\ntrip ended tragically: at approximately 5:00 a.m., Jason, driving\n\nat a high speed, lost control of the car and crashed into a tree.\n\nJason's   spine       was   injured,   paralyzing       him   and   leaving   him\n\npermanently disabled.\n\n              The suit claimed that the police, by having picked up\n\nJason   and    then    releasing   him,      were    responsible    for   Jason's\n\ninjuries.      The defendants moved for summary judgment on various\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fgrounds.      They argued, inter alia, that Officer McClellan1 was\n\nprotected by qualified immunity, that there were no constitutional\n\nviolations or tortious acts, and that there was no basis to hold\n\nthe town liable. The magistrate judge, sitting by consent, granted\n\nsummary judgment for the defendants on several state law claims,\n\nbut denied it as to the federal civil rights claims and the state\n\nlaw claims of negligence and false imprisonment. Officer McClellan\n\nappeals the magistrate judge's denial of summary judgment on his\n\nqualified     immunity      defense.     We    reverse   and   direct    entry   of\n\njudgment in favor of Officer McClellan.\n\n                                         I.\n\n              On summary judgment, we review the testimony in the light\n\nmost favorable to the plaintiffs.\n\n              Officer McClellan gave the following account in his\n\ndeposition.      At around 11:00 p.m. on the evening of September 11,\n\n1999, Officer McClellan and several other policemen broke up a\n\nparty    in   Conway   at    which     numerous   underage     individuals    were\n\nconsuming alcohol.       They detained so many teenagers that a school\n\nbus was needed to transport them to the police station.                  While the\n\nofficers were in the process of rounding up the partygoers, several\n\njuveniles ran away, crossing through a nearby river.                    The police\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Originally, Lieutenant David Bennett was also sued, but the\nparties stipulated to his dismissal as a defendant.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fwere, as a result, looking for teenagers with wet clothes who had\n\nbeen at the party.\n\n            McClellan was returning to the police station after\n\ntaking home a juvenile girl who had been detained at the party when\n\nhe spotted two other minors walking along East Main Street in\n\nConway, which is Route 302, a federal highway.                These teenagers,\n\nwho   turned   out    to    be   Jason   Tremblay    and   Dale    Bell,   were\n\napproximately three miles away from the site of the earlier party.\n\nOfficer McClellan had previously arrested Dale three different\n\ntimes, twice for the possession of alcohol.           When McClellan slowed\n\ndown his police car to get a closer look, he observed that Dale was\n\nwearing pants that were wet halfway up his calf.                His shoes were\n\nalso wet. Suspecting that these two teenagers were among those who\n\nhad   run   through   the    river   after   the    earlier    party,   Officer\n\nMcClellan stopped his car to speak with them.                 As he approached\n\nthem, he detected an odor of alcohol \"amongst them\" and noticed\n\nthat Dale's eyes were blood-shot and glassy.               He asked the boys\n\nwhether they had attended the party and whether they had drunk any\n\nalcohol that evening.\n\n            Officer McClellan said that both teenagers denied either\n\ngoing to the party or drinking alcohol that night.                   McClellan\n\nbelieved that Dale was lying, but was not sure about Jason, who\n\nshowed no outward signs of intoxication and whose pants did not\n\nappear wet.    He told both minors to get into the backseat of the\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fpolice car.          He then called in to the police station and reported\n\nthat he had picked up two boys and that \"One is 10-59.\"                           The\n\nevidence       was    that   this    was   a     code   for   either   drinking   or\n\nintoxication.2         Neither Dale nor Jason had any alcohol on him at\n\nthe time.\n\n               When asked what danger to the boys justified picking them\n\nup, McClellan stated: \"Late at night, walking along the side of the\n\nroad having consumed alcohol, [they] could get hit by a car.                  Lots\n\nof things happen at nighttime.\"\n\n               It is what Officer McClellan knew at the time of the\n\ndetention that is important for the detention claim.                   We describe\n\nthe later events because they are relevant to the negligent release\n\nclaims and for their corroborative effect on his testimony as to\n\nboth claims.          As Officer McClellan began to drive away with Jason\n\nand Dale, two other teenagers, Michael Palughi and an unidentified\n\ngirl, approached the police car on bicycles.                    They claimed that\n\nthey had spent the evening with Jason and Dale and that the four of\n\nthem had neither been to the party nor consumed alcohol that night.\n\nGiven    the    evidence     of     alcohol    consumption,     Officer   McClellan\n\nbelieved that they were trying to cover for their friends Dale and\n\n\n\n     2\n      At oral argument, counsel for the plaintiffs argued that\nOfficer McClellan's report that Dale was \"10-59\" supported the\ninference that Dale was drinking, but not intoxicated. If Dale\nwere really intoxicated, counsel argued, then Officer McClellan\nwould have specifically noted that fact. The code used encompassed\nboth drinking and intoxication.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fJason, and he continued toward the police station. During the ride\n\nDale was belligerent and kept insisting that the two of them had\n\nnot been drinking that evening and that Officer McClellan should\n\nhave also arrested Michael and the girl.\n\n           Officer McClellan arrived at the police station with the\n\ntwo boys at 2:04 a.m.   He entered their two names in the juvenile\n\ndetention log with the notation \"PC,\" for protective custody,3 and\n\nagain asked the two whether they had been drinking alcohol that\n\nevening.   Jason continued to deny having consumed any alcohol.\n\nOfficer McClellan then asked another officer, who was walking\n\nthrough the booking room, whether she could smell any alcohol on\n\neither of the minors.      That officer said that she did smell\n\nalcohol on Dale.   She also said that she did not smell any alcohol\n\non Jason, but that the whole room smelled of alcohol.      At this\n\npoint, Officer McClellan determined that he did not have sufficient\n\nevidence that Jason had been drinking to keep him, although the\n\nofficer still smelled alcohol on them.\n\n\n     3\n      The applicable New Hampshire statute provides that:\n        Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as\n        forbidding any police officer from immediately\n        taking into custody any minor who is found\n        violating any law, or whose arrest would be\n        permissible under RSA 594:10, or who is reasonably\n        believed to be a fugitive from justice, or whose\n        circumstances are such as to endanger such minor's\n        person or welfare, unless immediate action is\n        taken.\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 169-B:9.     In addition to § 169-B:9, the\ndefendants rely on §§ 169-C:6 and 169-D:8. Analysis of § 169-B:9\nsuffices.\n\n                                -6-\n\f            Jason had told Officer McClellan that his parents were\n\nnot at home and that he wanted to go home with Dale.       Jason also\n\nsaid he did not know how to reach them.   Officer McClellan called\n\nDale's mother to come pick up her son.    He also told her, either\n\nover the phone or at the station, that he had taken Jason into\n\ncustody because he suspected that Jason had been drinking.         He\n\nasked if she would take Jason as well, but she declined to take\n\nresponsibility for Jason. Her testimony confirms this. On Jason's\n\nsuggestion, Officer McClellan also contacted the mother of Michael\n\nPalughi, with whom Jason had planned to spend the night.    But after\n\nhearing the circumstances under which Jason was at the police\n\nstation, she too refused to take custody of him.     Her testimony\n\nconfirms this.    Having been unable to locate an adult who would\n\ntake Jason, Officer McClellan drove Jason home at 3:01 a.m. and\n\nextracted a promise from him that he would stay home until he heard\n\nfrom his parents.\n\n            All of the material elements of Officer McClellan's\n\naccount are consistent with the deposition testimony of the others\n\ninvolved. Jason testified that he and Dale had indeed drunk Kahlua\n\nthat evening, accounting for the odor that Officer McClellan\n\nreported.   Jason confirmed that he and Dale had been walking along\n\nEast Maine Street at around 2:00 a.m. when Officer McClellan\n\nstopped them and that the bottoms of Dale's pants had been wet.\n\nAccording to Jason, the first thing that Officer McClellan said as\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fhe approached the boys was that \"I can smell alcohol on you all the\n\nway over here.\"   Like Officer McClellan, Jason reported that a\n\nthird officer at the police station determined that Dale smelled of\n\nalcohol and Jason did not.   And Jason admitted that when Officer\n\nMcClellan asked him where his parents were, he told him that they\n\n\"were in Maine somewhere\" and lied in stating that he did not know\n\nhow to reach them.     In addition, Jason reported that Officer\n\nMcClellan asked both Dale's mother and Michael's mother if they\n\nwould take responsibility for him.\n\n          Officer McClellan's testimony was also consistent, in all\n\nmaterial respects, with the deposition testimony of Dale Bell.\n\nDale testified that he drank most of a bottle of Kahlua that night,\n\nand that Jason also drank \"a swig\" of Kahlua.   Dale also confirmed\n\nthat Officer McClellan told both juveniles that they smelled of\n\nalcohol and asked them whether they had attended an earlier party\n\nbecause the bottom of Dale's pants were wet.     Once at the police\n\nstation, according to Dale, Jason told McClellan that his parents\n\nwere out of town and Dale's mother refused to take Jason.\n\n          The deposition testimony of Dale's mother, Patricia Bell,\n\nand Michael's mother, Gail Palughi, provides further confirmation\n\nof Officer McClellan's story. Patricia Bell explained that Officer\n\nMcClellan had called her late at night and told her that she needed\n\nto pick up Dale from the police station.   When she arrived, Officer\n\nMcClellan said that he believed Dale had attended an earlier\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fdrinking party and had run away when the police took the partygoers\n\ninto custody.   He also told her that he believed that Dale had been\n\ndrinking that night.       Patricia Bell further testified that Officer\n\nMcClellan asked her if she would take Jason home with her because\n\nthe police were unable to locate his parents and that she declined\n\nthis request.\n\n           Gail Palughi also testified that she received a late-\n\nnight call from Officer McClellan in which he asked her whether she\n\nwould be   willing   to     take   responsibility    for     Jason.    Officer\n\nMcClellan explained to her that Jason was at the police station and\n\nhad been picked up because he smelled of alcohol.            He also told her\n\nthat her son Michael had been present when he had picked up Jason,\n\nbut that he hadn't taken Michael into custody.               Although she had\n\nearlier told Michael that Jason could stay over, Gail Palughi\n\ntestified that she did not want to take responsibility for Jason\n\nunder these circumstances.\n\n           Jason   and     his   father    brought   suit    against   Officer\n\nMcClellan under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that McClellan violated\n\nhis First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights when he took him\n\ninto custody and then released him.              He also sued the Town of\n\nConway   for   allegedly    promulgating     a   policy     of   \"rounding   up\"\n\njuveniles based on their mere proximity to alcoholic beverages. In\n\naddition, Tremblay asserted several pendent tort claims against\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fOfficer McClellan, including a negligence claim for releasing\n\nTremblay without adult supervision.\n\n             The magistrate judge denied Officer McClellan's motion\n\nfor summary judgment on his qualified immunity defense to the §\n\n1983 claim.\n\n                                   II.\n\nA. Appellate Jurisdiction\n\n             The parties agree that we have interlocutory appellate\n\njurisdiction over the denial of the qualified immunity defense.\n\nSuch jurisdiction ordinarily exists unless there are controlling\n\nissues of fact that must be resolved at the trial court level.            See\n\nBehrens v. Pelletier, 516 U.S. 299, 305-07 (1996).\n\n          On the record, it is clear to us that no material facts\n\nare in dispute.    It appears that the magistrate judge decided the\n\nmerits of the immunity question against McClellan when he concluded\n\n\"[t]here are no facts in the record that demonstrate that McClellan\n\nreasonably    believed   that   Jason    was    in   imminent   danger   when\n\nMcClellan took Jason into custody.\" Of course, Officer McClellan's\n\nsubjective intent is irrelevant.        The test for qualified immunity\n\nin this context is an objective one.           See Crawford-El v. Britton,\n\n523 U.S. 574, 587-88 (1998); Stoutt v. Banco Popular de P.R., 320\n\nF.3d 26, 31-32 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fB. Qualified Immunity Under § 1983\n\n          Our review of the district court's denial of summary\n\njudgment on qualified immunity grounds is de novo.                     Valente v.\n\nWallace, 332 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          The Supreme Court has encouraged lower courts generally\n\nto address first the question whether at some abstract level the\n\nplaintiffs have asserted a violation of constitutional rights,\n\nsecond whether those rights are clearly established, and third\n\nwhether a reasonable officer could have concluded that his actions\n\ndid not violate plaintiffs' constitutional rights.                 See Saucier v.\n\nKatz, 533 U.S. 194, 201-02 (2001). That encouragement has led this\n\ncourt to describe the qualified immunity test as having three\n\nparts, see Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office of Suffolk Dist., 298\n\nF.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir. 2002), though sometimes we have described it\n\nas a two-part test, see Santana v. Calderon, 342 F.3d 18, 23 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n          The     reason     given      for     first   addressing    the   alleged\n\nconstitutional       violation     is        that   doing   so   assists    in   the\n\ndevelopment     of     the   law        on     what     constitutes   meritorious\n\nconstitutional claims.         See Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201.                In many\n\ncases that approach is useful, especially where some novel theory\n\nis advanced. The utility of this approach, however, depends on the\n\nlevel of generality that is permitted in stating the constitutional\n\nright at stake.      Here, for example, if the question asked is framed\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fat the abstract level of whether a police officer may detain a\n\nperson without any cause, then the plaintiffs have stated a claim\n\nunder the Fourth Amendment.        But saying that does not clarify the\n\nlaw; it just crosses oft-tread ground.\n\n          Alternatively, the question could be framed as whether it\n\nis unconstitutional for a police officer, acting under a state\n\nprotective    custody   statute,    to   detain    a   juvenile   reasonably\n\nsuspected to have been drinking and walking along a highway at two\n\nin the morning with an intoxicated juvenile companion.            This court\n\nhas recognized that a state may temporarily separate a child from\n\nhis or her parents, with additional due process protections to\n\nfollow, on reasonable suspicion that the child is in imminent\n\nperil, for example, from child abuse.       Suboh, 298 F.3d at 92; Hatch\n\nv. Dep't for Children, Youth & their Families, 274 F.3d 12, 21 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).     In Hatch, this court rejected the argument that\n\nsomething fairly close to probable cause was the constitutionally\n\nrequired standard.      See 274 F.3d at 21.       Here, the juveniles were\n\nnot even separated from their parents, only from a darkened highway\n\nat 2 a.m., and were released almost immediately.\n\n          This analysis supports the constitutionality of a statute\n\nauthorizing the temporary protective detention of a child when\n\nthere is reasonable suspicion to believe that he or she is in\n\nimmediate danger. But it does not resolve whether the detention of\n\nJason was authorized under New Hampshire law: while there is in our\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fview no federal constitutional bar to protective custody of a\n\njuvenile based on reasonable suspicion of immediate danger to the\n\njuvenile,    the   detention   could     still   be   unlawful,   but   not\n\nnecessarily unconstitutional, if New Hampshire law required a\n\nhigher level of suspicion.        New Hampshire has not defined what\n\nquantum of suspicion or cause is needed to detain a juvenile under\n\nits protective custody statute.4\n\n            Although Saucier can be read as encouraging federal\n\ncourts to decide unclear legal questions in order to clarify the\n\nlaw for the future, it surely did not mean to require federal\n\ncourts to define and clarify unclear state statutes when this is\n\nwholly unnecessary to decide the case at hand.         The plaintiffs are\n\nnot contending that the U.S. Constitution compels New Hampshire to\n\nadopt a standard more stringent than reasonable suspicion for\n\nprotective custody.    In fact, the parties agree, as do we, that the\n\nultimate    question   resolves   into     whether    New   Hampshire   law\n\nauthorized the officer's action based on a reasonable concern that\n\nJason's welfare was endangered.\n\n            Even were a reasonable suspicion constitutional standard\n\nclearly established in 1999 for these circumstances, the question\n\nwould be whether an objectively reasonable officer in Officer\n\n\n\n     4\n      The New Hampshire statute makes clear that endangerment of a\nminor's welfare is a basis for custody but the language of the\nstatute is silent as to the level of likelihood required under this\nprong.\n\n                                  -13-\n\fMcClellan's position could have understood that his actions did not\n\nviolate the Fourth Amendment. This question could be considered to\n\nmerge the second and third prongs of the immunity analysis.             See\n\nTower v. Leslie-Brown, 326 F.3d 290, 296 (1st Cir. 2003).           On the\n\nundisputed facts, there is no doubt that a reasonable officer could\n\nhave understood that his actions were authorized by the statute and\n\nconstitutional.\n\n              An objectively reasonable officer in Officer McClellan's\n\nposition could have believed that New Hampshire law required no\n\nmore   than    reasonable   suspicion   of   immediate   endangerment   for\n\nprotective custody of a juvenile and could have had reasonable\n\nsuspicion that Jason fit within the statutory requirements -- that\n\nis, that the circumstances were such that Jason's \"person or\n\nwelfare\" was endangered.         It is undisputed that when Officer\n\nMcClellan encountered the two sixteen-year-olds, Jason's companion,\n\nDale, appeared visibly intoxicated.          Dale's eyes were glassy and\n\nbloodshot, he smelled of alcohol, and he had wet pant legs and\n\nshoes, indicia of the earlier drinking party.            Dale had drinking\n\nproblems in the past that were known to McClellan.          There was also\n\na reasonable basis to suspect that Jason had been drinking.             The\n\nodor of alcohol came from \"amongst\" them. Jason was with Dale;\n\nmaking reasonable a suspicion that Jason had also been drinking and\n\nhad attended the party along with Dale.

And a reasonable officer, with some\n\nbasis to suspect that Jason had been drinking, could have been\n\nconcerned that taking only Dale into custody and leaving Jason\n\nalone on the highway, not knowing where he would go, could endanger\n\nhim.5       Under the circumstances here, a reasonable officer could\n\nhave believed that he or she was authorized to take Jason into\n\nprotective custody and then to release him to his home.\n\n                                     III.\n\n              The magistrate judge's denial of qualified immunity for\n\nOfficer McClellan is reversed; the case is remanded to the district\n\ncourt judge with instructions to grant Officer McClellan's motion\n\nfor     summary   judgment   on   qualified   immunity   and   for   further\n\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.

Jason and his friend were taken to the police station, and, a short time later, Jason was brought home. He then took a family car without permission, picked up two friends, and drove to Maine. The trip ended tragically: at approximately 5:00 a.m., Jason, driving at a high speed, lost control of the car and crashed into a tree.

They argued, inter alia, that Officer McClellan<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> was protected by qualified immunity, that there were no constitutional violations or tortious acts, and that there was no basis to hold the town liable. The magistrate judge, sitting by consent, granted summary judgment for the defendants on several state law claims, but denied it as to the federal civil rights claims and the state law claims of negligence and false imprisonment. Officer McClellan appeals the magistrate judge's denial of summary judgment on his qualified immunity defense. We reverse and direct entry of judgment in favor of Officer McClellan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On summary judgment, we review the testimony in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer McClellan gave the following account in his deposition. At around 11:00 p.m. on the evening of September 11, 1999, Officer McClellan and several other policemen broke up a party in Conway at which numerous underage individuals were consuming alcohol. They detained so many teenagers that a school bus was needed to transport them to the police station. While the officers were in the process of rounding up the partygoers, several juveniles ran away, crossing through a nearby river. The police were, as a result, looking for teenagers with wet clothes who had been at the party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McClellan was returning to the police station after taking home a juvenile girl who had been detained at the party when he spotted two other minors walking along East Main Street in Conway, which is Route 302, a federal highway. These teenagers, who turned out to be Jason Tremblay and Dale Bell, were approximately three miles away from the site of the earlier party. Officer McClellan had previously arrested Dale three different times, twice for the possession of alcohol. When McClellan slowed down his police car to get a closer look, he observed that Dale was wearing pants that were wet halfway up his calf. His shoes were also wet. Suspecting that these two teenagers were among those who had run through the river after the earlier party, Officer McClellan stopped his car to speak with them. As he approached them, he detected an odor of alcohol \"amongst them\" and noticed that Dale's eyes were blood-shot and glassy. He asked the boys whether they had attended the party and whether they had drunk any alcohol that evening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer McClellan said that both teenagers denied either going to the party or drinking alcohol that night. McClellan believed that Dale was lying, but was not sure about Jason, who showed no outward signs of intoxication and whose pants did not appear wet. He told both minors to get into the backseat of the police car. He then called in to the police station and reported that he had picked up two boys and that \"One is 10-59.\" The evidence was that this was a code for either drinking or intoxication.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Neither Dale nor Jason had any alcohol on him at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked what danger to the boys justified picking them up, McClellan stated: \"Late at night, walking along the side of the road having consumed alcohol, [they] could get hit by a car. Lots of things happen at nighttime.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is what Officer McClellan knew at the time of the detention that is important for the detention claim. We describe the later events because they are relevant to the negligent release claims and for their corroborative effect on his testimony as to both claims. As Officer McClellan began to drive away with Jason and Dale, two other teenagers, Michael Palughi and an unidentified girl, approached the police car on bicycles. They claimed that they had spent the evening with Jason and Dale and that the four of them had neither been to the party nor consumed alcohol that night. Given the evidence of alcohol consumption, Officer McClellan believed that they were trying to cover for their friends Dale and Jason, and he continued toward the police station. During the ride Dale was belligerent and kept insisting that the two of them had not been drinking that evening and that Officer McClellan should have also arrested Michael and the girl.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer McClellan arrived at the police station with the two boys at 2:04 a.m. He entered their two names in the juvenile detention log with the notation \"PC,\" for protective custody,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and again asked the two whether they had been drinking alcohol that evening. Jason continued to deny having consumed any alcohol. Officer McClellan then asked another officer, who was walking through the booking room, whether she could smell any alcohol on either of the minors. That officer said that she did smell alcohol on Dale. She also said that she did not smell any alcohol on Jason, but that the whole room smelled of alcohol. At this point, Officer McClellan determined that he did not have sufficient evidence that Jason had been drinking to keep him, although the officer still smelled alcohol on them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jason had told Officer McClellan that his parents were not at home and that he wanted to go home with Dale. Jason also said he did not know how to reach them. Officer McClellan called Dale's mother to come pick up her son. He also told her, either over the phone or at the station, that he had taken Jason into custody because he suspected that Jason had been drinking. He asked if she would take Jason as well, but she declined to take responsibility for Jason. Her testimony confirms this. On Jason's suggestion, Officer McClellan also contacted the mother of Michael Palughi, at whose house Jason had planned to spend the night. But after hearing the circumstances under which Jason was at the police station, she too refused to take custody of him. Her testimony confirms this. Having been unable to locate an adult who would take Jason, Officer McClellan drove Jason home at 3:01 a.m. and extracted a promise from him that he would stay home until he heard from his parents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the material elements of Officer McClellan's account are consistent with the deposition testimony of the others involved. Jason testified that he and Dale had indeed drunk Kahlua that evening, accounting for the odor that Officer McClellan reported. Jason confirmed that he and Dale had been walking along East Maine Street at around 2:00 a.m. when Officer McClellan stopped them and that the bottoms of Dale's pants had been wet. According to Jason, the first thing that Officer McClellan said as he approached the boys was that \"I can smell alcohol on you all the way over here.\" Like Officer McClellan, Jason reported that a third officer at the police station determined that Dale smelled of alcohol and Jason did not. And Jason admitted that when Officer McClellan asked him where his parents were, he told him that they \"were in Maine somewhere\" and lied in stating that he did not know how to reach them. In addition, Jason reported that Officer McClellan asked both Dale's mother and Michael's mother if they would take responsibility for him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer McClellan's testimony was also consistent, in all material respects, with the deposition testimony of Dale Bell. Dale testified that he drank most of a bottle of Kahlua that night, and that Jason also drank \"a swig\" of Kahlua. Dale also confirmed that Officer McClellan told both juveniles that they smelled of alcohol and asked them whether they had attended an earlier party because the bottom of Dale's pants were wet. Once at the police station, according to Dale, Jason told McClellan that his parents were out of town and Dale's mother refused to take Jason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deposition testimony of Dale's mother, Patricia Bell, and Michael's mother, Gail Palughi, provides further confirmation of Officer McClellan's story. Patricia Bell explained that Officer McClellan had called her late at night and told her that she needed to pick up Dale from the police station. When she arrived, Officer McClellan said that he believed Dale had attended an earlier drinking party and had run away when the police took the partygoers into custody. He also told her that he believed that Dale had been drinking that night. Patricia Bell further testified that Officer McClellan asked her if she would take Jason home with her because the police were unable to locate his parents and that she declined this request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gail Palughi also testified that she received a late-night call from Officer McClellan in which he asked her whether she would be willing to take responsibility for Jason. Officer McClellan explained to her that Jason was at the police station and had been picked up because he smelled of alcohol. He also told her that her son Michael had been present when he had picked up Jason, but that he hadn't taken Michael into custody. Although she had earlier told Michael that Jason could stay over, Gail Palughi testified that she did not want to take responsibility for Jason under these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jason and his father brought suit against Officer McClellan under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, alleging that McClellan violated his First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights when he took him into custody and then released him. He also sued the Town of Conway for allegedly promulgating a policy of \"rounding up\" juveniles based on their mere proximity to alcoholic beverages. In addition, Tremblay asserted several pendent tort claims against Officer McClellan, including a negligence claim for releasing Tremblay without adult supervision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge denied Officer McClellan's motion for summary judgment on his qualified immunity defense to the &#167; 1983 claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that we have interlocutory appellate jurisdiction over the denial of the qualified immunity defense. Such jurisdiction ordinarily exists unless there are controlling issues of fact that must be resolved at the trial court level. <i>See Behrens v. Pelletier,</i> 516 U.S. 299, 305-07, 116 S.Ct. 834, 133 L.Ed.2d 773 (1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the record, it is clear to us that no material facts are in dispute. It appears that the magistrate judge decided the merits of the immunity question against McClellan when he concluded \"[t]here are no facts in the record that demonstrate that McClellan reasonably believed that Jason was in imminent danger when McClellan took Jason into custody.\" Of course, Officer McClellan's subjective intent is irrelevant. The test for qualified immunity in this context is an objective one. <i>See Crawford-El v. Britton,</i> 523 U.S. 574, 587-88, 118 S.Ct. 1584, 140 L.Ed.2d 759 (1998); <i>Stoutt v. Banco Popular de P.R.,</i> 320 F.3d 26, 31-32 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Qualified Immunity Under &#167; 1983</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our review of the district court's denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds is de novo. <i>Valente v. Wallace,</i> 332 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has encouraged lower courts generally to address first the question whether at some abstract level the plaintiffs have asserted a violation of constitutional rights, second whether those rights are clearly established, and third whether a reasonable officer could have concluded that his actions did not violate plaintiffs' constitutional rights. <i>See Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201-02, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001). That encouragement has led this court to describe the qualified immunity test as having three parts, <i>see Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office of Suffolk Dist.,</i> 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir. 2002), though sometimes we have described it as a two-part test, <i>see Santana v. Calderon,</i> 342 F.3d 18, 23 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reason given for first addressing the alleged constitutional violation is that doing so assists in the development of the law on what constitutes meritorious constitutional claims. <i>See Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151. In many cases that approach is useful, especially where some novel theory is advanced. The utility of this approach, however, depends on the level of generality that is permitted in stating the constitutional right at stake. Here, for example, if the question asked is framed at the abstract level of whether a police officer may detain a person without any cause, then the plaintiffs have stated a claim under the Fourth Amendment. But saying that does not clarify the law; it just crosses oft-tread ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the question could be framed as whether it is unconstitutional for a police officer, acting under a state protective custody statute, to detain a juvenile reasonably suspected to have been drinking and walking along a highway at two in the morning with an intoxicated juvenile companion. This court has recognized that a state may temporarily separate a child from his or her parents, with additional due process protections to follow, on reasonable suspicion that the child is in imminent peril, for example, from child abuse. <i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 92; <i>Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth &amp; Their Families,</i> 274 F.3d 12, 21 (1st Cir.2001). In <i>Hatch,</i> this court rejected the argument that something fairly close to probable cause was the constitutionally required standard. <i>See</i> 274 F.3d at 21. Here, the juveniles were not even separated from their parents, only from a darkened highway at 2 a.m., and were released almost immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This analysis supports the constitutionality of a statute authorizing the temporary protective detention of a child when there is reasonable suspicion to believe that he or she is in immediate danger. But it does not resolve whether the detention of Jason was authorized under New Hampshire law: while there is in our view no federal constitutional bar to protective custody of a juvenile based on reasonable suspicion of immediate danger to the juvenile, the detention could still be unlawful, but not necessarily unconstitutional, if New Hampshire law required a higher level of suspicion. New Hampshire has not defined what quantum of suspicion or cause is needed to detain a juvenile under its protective custody statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although <i>Saucier</i> can be read as encouraging federal courts to decide unclear legal questions in order to clarify the law for the future, it surely did not mean to require federal courts to define and clarify unclear state statutes when this is wholly unnecessary to decide the case at hand. The plaintiffs are not contending that the U.S. Constitution compels New Hampshire to adopt a standard more stringent than reasonable suspicion for protective custody. In fact, the parties agree, as do we, that the ultimate question resolves into whether New Hampshire law authorized the officer's action based on a reasonable concern that Jason's welfare was endangered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were a reasonable suspicion constitutional standard clearly established in 1999 for these circumstances, the question would be whether an objectively reasonable officer in Officer McClellan's position could have understood that his actions did not violate the Fourth Amendment. This question could be considered to merge the second and third prongs of the immunity analysis. <i>See Tower v. Leslie-Brown,</i> 326 F.3d 290, 296 (1st Cir.2003). On the undisputed facts, there is no doubt that a reasonable officer could have understood that his actions were authorized by the statute and constitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An objectively reasonable officer in Officer McClellan's position could have believed that New Hampshire law required no more than reasonable suspicion of immediate endangerment for protective custody of a juvenile and could have had reasonable suspicion that Jason fit within the statutory requirements &#8212; that is, that the circumstances were such that Jason's \"person or welfare\" was endangered. It is undisputed that when Officer McClellan encountered the two sixteen-year-olds, Jason's companion, Dale, appeared visibly intoxicated. Dale's eyes were glassy and bloodshot, he smelled of alcohol, and he had wet pant legs and shoes, indicia of the earlier drinking party. Dale had drinking problems in the past that were known to McClellan. There was also a reasonable basis to suspect that Jason had been drinking. The odor of alcohol came from \"amongst\" them. Jason was with Dale, making reasonable a suspicion that Jason had also been drinking and had attended the party along with Dale. It would be reasonable to suppose that the two of them would not have been walking along the same road at two in the morning, one having been drinking and the other not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two were walking along a federal highway in the middle of the night; an objectively reasonable officer could have been concerned that juveniles under the influence of alcohol run a risk of being hit by a car. And a reasonable officer, with some basis to suspect that Jason had been drinking, could have been concerned that taking only Dale into custody and leaving Jason alone on the highway, not knowing where he would go, could endanger him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Under the circumstances here, a reasonable officer could have believed that he or she was authorized to take Jason into protective custody and then to release him to his home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge's denial of qualified immunity for Officer McClellan is <i>reversed;</i> the case is <i>remanded</i> to the district court judge with instructions to grant Officer McClellan's motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.

The suit asserted violations of Jason's constitutional rights and pendent state law claims arising out of his temporary detention under New Hampshire's protective custody statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That detention occurred when Jason and a friend were picked up by Officer McClellan during the early morning hours of September 12, 1999, while walking along a major road just after 2:00 a.m. smelling of alcohol; the police had been called earlier that Saturday night to break up a nearby underage drinking party. Jason and his friend were taken to the police station, and, a short time later, Jason was brought home. He then took a family car without permission, picked up two friends, and drove to Maine. The trip ended tragically: at approximately 5:00 a.m., Jason, driving at a high speed, lost control of the car and crashed into a tree. Jason's spine was injured, paralyzing him and leaving him permanently disabled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suit claimed that the police, by having picked up Jason and then releasing him, were responsible for Jason's injuries. The defendants moved for summary judgment on various grounds. They argued, inter alia, that Officer McClellan<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> was protected by qualified immunity, that there were no constitutional violations or tortious acts, and that there was no basis to hold the town liable. The magistrate judge, sitting by consent, granted summary judgment for the defendants on several state law claims, but denied it as to the federal civil rights claims and the state law claims of negligence and false imprisonment. Officer McClellan appeals the magistrate judge's denial of summary judgment on his qualified immunity defense. We reverse and direct entry of judgment in favor of Officer McClellan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On summary judgment, we review the testimony in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer McClellan gave the following account in his deposition. At around 11:00 p.m. on the evening of September 11, 1999, Officer McClellan and several other policemen broke up a party in Conway at which numerous underage individuals were consuming alcohol. They detained so many teenagers that a school bus was needed to transport them to the police station. While the officers were in the process of rounding up the partygoers, several juveniles ran away, crossing through a nearby river. The police were, as a result, looking for teenagers with wet clothes who had been at the party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McClellan was returning to the police station after taking home a juvenile girl who had been detained at the party when he spotted two other minors walking along East Main Street in Conway, which is Route 302, a federal highway. These teenagers, who turned out to be Jason Tremblay and Dale Bell, were approximately three miles away from the site of the earlier party. Officer McClellan had previously arrested Dale three different times, twice for the possession of alcohol. When McClellan slowed down his police car to get a closer look, he observed that Dale was wearing pants that were wet halfway up his calf. His shoes were also wet. Suspecting that these two teenagers were among those who had run through the river after the earlier party, Officer McClellan stopped his car to speak with them. As he approached them, he detected an odor of alcohol \"amongst them\" and noticed that Dale's eyes were blood-shot and glassy. He asked the boys whether they had attended the party and whether they had drunk any alcohol that evening.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer McClellan said that both teenagers denied either going to the party or drinking alcohol that night. McClellan believed that Dale was lying, but was not sure about Jason, who showed no outward signs of intoxication and whose pants did not appear wet. He told both minors to get into the backseat of the police car. He then called in to the police station and reported that he had picked up two boys and that \"One is 10-59.\" The evidence was that this was a code for either drinking or intoxication.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Neither Dale nor Jason had any alcohol on him at the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked what danger to the boys justified picking them up, McClellan stated: \"Late at night, walking along the side of the road having consumed alcohol, [they] could get hit by a car. Lots of things happen at nighttime.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is what Officer McClellan knew at the time of the detention that is important for the detention claim. We describe the later events because they are relevant to the negligent release claims and for their corroborative effect on his testimony as to both claims. As Officer McClellan began to drive away with Jason and Dale, two other teenagers, Michael Palughi and an unidentified girl, approached the police car on bicycles. They claimed that they had spent the evening with Jason and Dale and that the four of them had neither been to the party nor consumed alcohol that night. Given the evidence of alcohol consumption, Officer McClellan believed that they were trying to cover for their friends Dale and Jason, and he continued toward the police station. During the ride Dale was belligerent and kept insisting that the two of them had not been drinking that evening and that Officer McClellan should have also arrested Michael and the girl.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer McClellan arrived at the police station with the two boys at 2:04 a.m. He entered their two names in the juvenile detention log with the notation \"PC,\" for protective custody,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and again asked the two whether they had been drinking alcohol that evening. Jason continued to deny having consumed any alcohol. Officer McClellan then asked another officer, who was walking through the booking room, whether she could smell any alcohol on either of the minors. That officer said that she did smell alcohol on Dale. She also said that she did not smell any alcohol on Jason, but that the whole room smelled of alcohol. At this point, Officer McClellan determined that he did not have sufficient evidence that Jason had been drinking to keep him, although the officer still smelled alcohol on them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jason had told Officer McClellan that his parents were not at home and that he wanted to go home with Dale. Jason also said he did not know how to reach them. Officer McClellan called Dale's mother to come pick up her son. He also told her, either over the phone or at the station, that he had taken Jason into custody because he suspected that Jason had been drinking. He asked if she would take Jason as well, but she declined to take responsibility for Jason. Her testimony confirms this. On Jason's suggestion, Officer McClellan also contacted the mother of Michael Palughi, at whose house Jason had planned to spend the night. But after hearing the circumstances under which Jason was at the police station, she too refused to take custody of him. Her testimony confirms this. Having been unable to locate an adult who would take Jason, Officer McClellan drove Jason home at 3:01 a.m. and extracted a promise from him that he would stay home until he heard from his parents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the material elements of Officer McClellan's account are consistent with the deposition testimony of the others involved. Jason testified that he and Dale had indeed drunk Kahlua that evening, accounting for the odor that Officer McClellan reported. Jason confirmed that he and Dale had been walking along East Maine Street at around 2:00 a.m. when Officer McClellan stopped them and that the bottoms of Dale's pants had been wet. According to Jason, the first thing that Officer McClellan said as he approached the boys was that \"I can smell alcohol on you all the way over here.\" Like Officer McClellan, Jason reported that a third officer at the police station determined that Dale smelled of alcohol and Jason did not. And Jason admitted that when Officer McClellan asked him where his parents were, he told him that they \"were in Maine somewhere\" and lied in stating that he did not know how to reach them. In addition, Jason reported that Officer McClellan asked both Dale's mother and Michael's mother if they would take responsibility for him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer McClellan's testimony was also consistent, in all material respects, with the deposition testimony of Dale Bell. Dale testified that he drank most of a bottle of Kahlua that night, and that Jason also drank \"a swig\" of Kahlua. Dale also confirmed that Officer McClellan told both juveniles that they smelled of alcohol and asked them whether they had attended an earlier party because the bottom of Dale's pants were wet. Once at the police station, according to Dale, Jason told McClellan that his parents were out of town and Dale's mother refused to take Jason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The deposition testimony of Dale's mother, Patricia Bell, and Michael's mother, Gail Palughi, provides further confirmation of Officer McClellan's story. Patricia Bell explained that Officer McClellan had called her late at night and told her that she needed to pick up Dale from the police station. When she arrived, Officer McClellan said that he believed Dale had attended an earlier drinking party and had run away when the police took the partygoers into custody. He also told her that he believed that Dale had been drinking that night. Patricia Bell further testified that Officer McClellan asked her if she would take Jason home with her because the police were unable to locate his parents and that she declined this request.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gail Palughi also testified that she received a late-night call from Officer McClellan in which he asked her whether she would be willing to take responsibility for Jason. Officer McClellan explained to her that Jason was at the police station and had been picked up because he smelled of alcohol. He also told her that her son Michael had been present when he had picked up Jason, but that he hadn't taken Michael into custody. Although she had earlier told Michael that Jason could stay over, Gail Palughi testified that she did not want to take responsibility for Jason under these circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Jason and his father brought suit against Officer McClellan under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983, alleging that McClellan violated his First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendment rights when he took him into custody and then released him. He also sued the Town of Conway for allegedly promulgating a policy of \"rounding up\" juveniles based on their mere proximity to alcoholic beverages. In addition, Tremblay asserted several pendent tort claims against Officer McClellan, including a negligence claim for releasing Tremblay without adult supervision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge denied Officer McClellan's motion for summary judgment on his qualified immunity defense to the &#167; 1983 claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Appellate Jurisdiction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that we have interlocutory appellate jurisdiction over the denial of the qualified immunity defense. Such jurisdiction ordinarily exists unless there are controlling issues of fact that must be resolved at the trial court level. <i>See Behrens v. Pelletier,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117996\"><a href=\"/opinion/117996/behrens-v-pelletier/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">299</span></a></span>, 305-07, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117996\"><a href=\"/opinion/117996/behrens-v-pelletier/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It appears that the magistrate judge decided the merits of the immunity question against McClellan when he concluded \"[t]here are no facts in the record that demonstrate that McClellan reasonably believed that Jason was in imminent danger when McClellan took Jason into custody.\" Of course, Officer McClellan's subjective intent is irrelevant. The test for qualified immunity in this context is an objective one. <i>See Crawford-El v.

Katz,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">194</span></span>, 201-02, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></span> (2001). That encouragement has led this court to describe the qualified immunity test as having three parts, <i>see Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office of Suffolk Dist.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></span>, 90 (1st Cir. 2002), though sometimes we have described it as a two-part test, <i>see Santana v. Calderon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200613\"><a href=\"/opinion/200613/santana-v-calderon/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The reason given for first addressing the alleged constitutional violation is that doing so assists in the development of the law on what constitutes meritorious constitutional claims. <i>See Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2151</span></span>. In many cases that approach is useful, especially where some novel theory is advanced. The utility of this approach, however, depends on the level of generality that is permitted in stating the constitutional right at stake. Here, for example, if the question asked is framed at the abstract level of whether a police officer may detain a person without any cause, then the plaintiffs have stated a claim under the Fourth Amendment. But saying that does not clarify the law; it just crosses oft-tread ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, the question could be framed as whether it is unconstitutional for a police officer, acting under a state protective custody statute, to detain a juvenile reasonably suspected to have been drinking and walking along a highway at two in the morning with an intoxicated juvenile companion. This court has recognized that a state may temporarily separate a child from his or her parents, with additional due process protections to follow, on reasonable suspicion that the child is in imminent peril, for example, from child abuse. <i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 92; <i>Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth &amp; Their Families,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775863\"><a href=\"/opinion/775863/richard-h-hatch-jr-v-department-for-children-youth-and-their-families/\"><span class=\"volume\">274</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.2001). In <i>Hatch,</i> this court rejected the argument that something fairly close to probable cause was the constitutionally required standard. <i>See</i> 274 F.3d at 21. Here, the juveniles were not even separated from their parents, only from a darkened highway at 2 a.m., and were released almost immediately.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This analysis supports the constitutionality of a statute authorizing the temporary protective detention of a child when there is reasonable suspicion to believe that he or she is in immediate danger. But it does not resolve whether the detention of Jason was authorized under New Hampshire law: while there is in our view no federal constitutional bar to protective custody of a juvenile based on reasonable suspicion of immediate danger to the juvenile, the detention could still be unlawful, but not necessarily unconstitutional, if New Hampshire law required a higher level of suspicion. New Hampshire has not defined what quantum of suspicion or cause is needed to detain a juvenile under its protective custody statute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although <i>Saucier</i> can be read as encouraging federal courts to decide unclear legal questions in order to clarify the law for the future, it surely did not mean to require federal courts to define and clarify unclear state statutes when this is wholly unnecessary to decide the case at hand. The plaintiffs are not contending that the U.S. Constitution compels New Hampshire to adopt a standard more stringent than reasonable suspicion for protective custody. In fact, the parties agree, as do we, that the ultimate question resolves into whether New Hampshire law authorized the officer's action based on a reasonable concern that Jason's welfare was endangered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even were a reasonable suspicion constitutional standard clearly established in 1999 for these circumstances, the question would be whether an objectively reasonable officer in Officer McClellan's position could have understood that his actions did not violate the Fourth Amendment. This question could be considered to merge the second and third prongs of the immunity analysis. <i>See Tower v. Leslie-Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200436\"><a href=\"/opinion/200436/tower-v-leslie-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">326</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">290</span></a></span>, 296 (1st Cir.2003). On the undisputed facts, there is no doubt that a reasonable officer could have understood that his actions were authorized by the statute and constitutional.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An objectively reasonable officer in Officer McClellan's position could have believed that New Hampshire law required no more than reasonable suspicion of immediate endangerment for protective custody of a juvenile and could have had reasonable suspicion that Jason fit within the statutory requirements &#8212; that is, that the circumstances were such that Jason's \"person or welfare\" was endangered. It is undisputed that when Officer McClellan encountered the two sixteen-year-olds, Jason's companion, Dale, appeared visibly intoxicated. Dale's eyes were glassy and bloodshot, he smelled of alcohol, and he had wet pant legs and shoes, indicia of the earlier drinking party. Dale had drinking problems in the past that were known to McClellan. There was also a reasonable basis to suspect that Jason had been drinking. The odor of alcohol came from \"amongst\" them. Jason was with Dale, making reasonable a suspicion that Jason had also been drinking and had attended the party along with Dale. It would be reasonable to suppose that the two of them would not have been walking along the same road at two in the morning, one having been drinking and the other not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two were walking along a federal highway in the middle of the night; an objectively reasonable officer could have been concerned that juveniles under the influence of alcohol run a risk of being hit by a car. And a reasonable officer, with some basis to suspect that Jason had been drinking, could have been concerned that taking only Dale into custody and leaving Jason alone on the highway, not knowing where he would go, could endanger him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Under the circumstances here, a reasonable officer could have believed that he or she was authorized to take Jason into protective custody and then to release him to his home.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge's denial of qualified immunity for Officer McClellan is <i>reversed;</i> the case is <i>remanded</i> to the district court judge with instructions to grant Officer McClellan's motion for summary judgment on qualified immunity and for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.
