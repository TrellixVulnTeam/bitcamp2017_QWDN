Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n\n                    Cyr, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n              and Oberdorfer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Benjamin D. Entine, for appellant.\n     Kirby A. Heller, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, Joshua Levy, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, Carmen Ortiz, Assistant United States\nAttorney, and Monica S. Abrams, Attorney, Appellate Section,\nCriminal Division, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         February 2, 2004\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the District of Columbia, sitting by designation.\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.    Defendant-appellant Donald L.\n\nGonczy (\"Gonczy\") appeals his sentence on the grounds that the\n\ngovernment breached its plea agreement with him.      We vacate the\n\njudgment and sentence, and remand for resentencing.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          Pursuant to a plea agreement with the government, Gonczy\n\npled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail\n\nfraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 371; eight counts of wire fraud,\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1343; and twenty-three counts of mail\n\nfraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1341.       Gonczy was part of a\n\nhighly sophisticated telemarketing scheme, by which a large number\n\nof timeshare owners were induced to buy an appraisal provided by\n\nGonczy and his companies at $400 each.     All appraisals, however,\n\nwere worthless, no timeshare unit having ever been inspected.    The\n\ngovernment estimated that there were roughly 38,000 victims, thus\n\ncausing over $15 million in collective losses to the timeshare\n\nowners.\n\n          Under the plea agreement, the government was obligated to\n\nrecommend \"incarceration at the low end of the [United States\n\nSentencing] [G]uideline[s] range calculated by the court. . . .,\"\n\nalthough the agreement specified that such recommendation was not\n\nbinding on the district court.    Gonczy also specifically reserved\n\nthe right to argue for a downward departure.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f          At the disposition hearing, the district court calculated\n\nthe sentencing range to be between 70 and 87 months, which both\n\nparties agreed was within the appropriate range.    However, after\n\nhearing arguments, the district court sentenced Gonczy to the top\n\nend of the range; viz. 84 months' imprisonment.\n\n                                II.\n\n          One issue controls the outcome of Gonczy's appeal, and\n\nthat is whether the government breached the plea agreement,1   for\n\nif the statements of the Assistant United States Attorney (\"AUSA\")\n\nconstitute a breach of the plea agreement, we will remand for\n\nresentencing. See, e.g., United States v. Riggs, 287 F.3d 221, 226\n\n(1st Cir. 2002). An alternative remedy is to allow withdrawal of\n\nthe guilty plea.    Santobello, 404 U.S. at 263; United States v.\n\nClark, 55 F.3d 9, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1995).      However, Gonczy has\n\nrequested that the case be remanded for resentencing.\n\n          If a proper objection is brought before the district\n\ncourt, breaches of plea agreements present questions of law for\n\nplenary review.    United States v. Canada, 960 F.2d 263, 269 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).   When a defendant does not object to the breach of the\n\n\n\n\n1\n  Gonczy argued that there were two issues on appeal: whether the\nplea agreement was breached, and whether the district judge erred\nin sentencing Gonczy. A breach of a plea agreement is deemed a\nviolation of that agreement by the government, not by the\nsentencing judge. See generally Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S.\n257, 262 (1971).\n\n                                -3-\n\fplea agreement at the sentencing hearing, this court reviews for\n\nplain error.   Riggs, 287 F.3d at 224.\n\n          The government argues that Gonczy's counsel did not\n\nproperly object because he neither stated the reason for his\n\nobjection when the alleged breach occurred, nor did he request the\n\nplea be withdrawn, or ask the district court for the remedy of\n\nspecific performance.    The government further argues that, even if\n\ncounsel effectively objected, the district court did not address\n\nthe issue of the breach and Gonczy therefore waived his objections.\n\nWe see it differently.\n\n          The government's argument fails not only because Gonczy's\n\ncounsel did object, but because the record shows that the district\n\ncourt was aware of both the objection and the underlying reasons.\n\nWe have held that an objection is sufficiently raised as long as\n\nit brings the purported breach of the plea agreement to the\n\ndistrict court's attention.    See, e.g., United States v. Giraud-\n\nPiñeiro, 269 F.3d 23, 25 (1st Cir. 2001)(holding defendant failed\n\nto object because he had \"knowledge of the conduct that purportedly\n\namounts to a breach[,] but nevertheless fail[ed] to bring it to the\n\nattention of the district court\").     The government does not cite\n\nany authority to support its argument that counsel is required to\n\npresent a more specific objection.     In the present case, when the\n\nAUSA concluded her statement as to the sentencing range, Gonzcy's\n\ncounsel stated:\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          Your Honor, I object to the government\n          characterizing that what should proceed in\n          this [c]ourt at a minimum represents the\n          guidelines when the government has entered\n          into a plea agreement in which they have\n          agreed to recommend the bottom of the\n          guidelines in connection with that plea\n          agreement.    Counsel's statement tends to\n          undermine   the  very   agreement that  the\n          government has entered into.\n\n          So, your Honor, with all the flourish that we\n          heard concerning this case just now, I think\n          the [c]ourt is well aware of the facts of this\n          case and all of those facts which were\n          presented by counsel are merged into the\n          government's conclusions that what should be\n          done in this case is a sentence of 70 months.\n\n          Gonczy's counsel's purpose and reasons are clear both\n\nfrom the phrase \"I object\" and the subsequent discussion of the\n\nprosecutor's argument before the district court.      More to the\n\npoint, near the conclusion of the hearing, Gonczy's counsel alerted\n\nthe district court that \"[t]he defense does not waive any objection\n\nto [the AUSA's] remarks in the context of this argument.\"      The\n\ndistrict judge specifically noted, after sentencing Gonczy, that\n\nthe \"objection is not only appropriate but [counsel is] wise to\n\nmaintain it.\"   Therefore, we consider Gonczy's objection to have\n\nbeen sufficiently raised, and thus accord Gonczy's appeal plenary\n\nreview.\n\n                               III.\n\n          Gonczy argues that the AUSA violated the plea agreement\n\nwhen she argued for a sentence in excess of the agreed-upon\n\nrecommendation of 70 months.   The government disagrees, alleging\n\n                               -5-\n\fthat the prosecutor did recommend 70 months.           It argues that the\n\nprosecutor's statements were merely anticipating Gonczy's motion\n\nfor a downward departure.\n\n           A plea agreement is a binding promise by the government\n\nand is an inducement for the guilty plea; a failure to support that\n\npromise    is   a    breach   of   the   plea   agreement,   whether   done\n\ndeliberately or not.      See Santobello v. New York, 404 U.S. 257, 262\n\n(1971);    see also United States v. Saxena, 229 F.3d 1, 6-8 (1st\n\nCir. 2000), United States v. Kurkculer, 918 F.2d 295, 302 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).\n\n           At the sentencing hearing, the AUSA's remarks began with\n\nthe statement that \"in line with th[e plea] the government would be\n\nrecommending 70 months' imprisonment . . . .\"                The AUSA then\n\nreviewed the facts of the offense, as required at a sentencing\n\nhearing.   The government's review of the facts of the case and of\n\nGonczy's character cannot constitute a breach of the plea agreement\n\nas they were relevant to the court's imposition of sentence; no\n\nlimitation can be placed, by agreement or otherwise, on this\n\ninformation.        See Saxena, 229 F.3d at 6 (noting that under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3661 no limitation is permitted on the type of character\n\ninformation a district court may receive for consideration in\n\nimposing sentence).      The government has a duty to bring all facts\n\nrelevant to sentencing to the judge's attention.             See id.   This\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fduty coexists with the government's duty to abide by a plea\n\nagreement.\n\n          We are mindful, however, that a defendant entering into\n\na plea agreement with the government undertakes to waive certain\n\nfundamental constitutional rights; because of that waiver, the\n\ngovernment is required to meet \"the most meticulous standards of\n\nboth promise and performance.\"     Riggs, 287 F.3d at 224 (citations\n\nomitted); see also Santobello, 404 U.S. at 261.     In this case, the\n\nsubstance of the prosecutor's argument at the sentencing hearing\n\ncan only be understood to have emphasized Gonczy's wrongdoing and\n\nhis leadership role in the offense, advocating for the imposition\n\nof a higher sentence than the agreed-upon term of 70 months.   After\n\nsummarizing the facts of the case, she argued to the district court\n\nas follows:\n\n                 I would submit, your Honor, that the\n             defendant was the brains behind this operation\n             . . . that he set up these appraisal companies\n             that obtained the moneys from innocent victims\n             that exist in this case . . . .\n\n                 Your Honor, the defendant through his\n             conduct ruined many lives.     He set up this\n             elaborate operation that involved numerous,\n             numerous individuals. He ruined the lives of\n             his own children. Although they willingly and\n             voluntarily participated in this scheme, he is\n             the one that brought them and involved them in\n             this through his own promises.\n\n                This was also, I want to inform the Court,\n             this was a very blatant fraud. Despite being\n             aware   of  law enforcement    investigations\n             locally initially that were conducted by the\n             Florida Department of Law Enforcement, the\n\n                                  -7-\n\f           defendant basically laughed in the face of law\n           enforcement efforts and even upon becoming\n           aware of federal law enforcement efforts\n           through the investigation that we were\n           conducting and the numerous searches that we\n           conducted throughout the country, continued to\n           operate this scheme to defraud and continued\n           to operate it after he left to go to St.\n           Marten [sic] and fled there.      And I would\n           submit, your Honor, that this scheme did not\n           come to a halt despite our investigation,\n           despite our searches and seizures, until Mr.\n           Gonczy himself was finally arrested in January\n           of 2001 and then extradited back to this\n           country from St. Marten [sic].\n\nThe district     court    chided   the     AUSA    for   being   repetitive    and\n\neffectively ended her argument.             The prosecutor then concluded,\n\nstating   that   \"the     defendant   at    a     minimum   deserves   what    the\n\nguidelines provide for and those are his just deserts [sic].\"\n\n           We have found in similar circumstances that an AUSA\n\nviolated a plea agreement when she \"never . . . affirmatively\n\nrecommended a 36-month sentence and her comments seemed to undercut\n\nsuch a recommendation.\"       Canada, 960 F.2d at 268.             In Canada, we\n\nfound that while the AUSA's comments \"stopped short of explicitly\n\nrepudiating the agreement, Santobello prohibits not only explicit\n\nrepudiation    of   the   government's      assurances,      but   must   in   the\n\ninterests of fairness be read to forbid end-runs around them.\" Id.\n\nat 269 (citations and quotation marks omitted).\n\n           The government argues that this appeal is distinguishable\n\nfrom Canada because the AUSA in fact recommended 70 months.                    No\n\nmagic formula exists for a prosecutor to comply with the agreed-\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fupon sentence recommendation, but the prosecutor's \"overall conduct\n\nmust be reasonably consistent with making such a recommendation,\n\nrather than the reverse.\"    Id. at 268; see also Saxena, 229 F.3d at\n\n6   (\"[s]atisfying   this   obligation   [under   the   plea   agreement]\n\nrequires more than lip service on a prosecutor's part.\").            The\n\ninitial recommendation in Gonczy's case was undercut, if not\n\neviscerated, by the AUSA's substantive argument to the district\n\ncourt.\n\n           The government's argument that the prosecutor was merely\n\nanticipating the request for a downward departure is unavailing.\n\nThe district court in the sentencing hearing clearly designated the\n\nfirst part of the hearing for the sentence recommendation and the\n\nsecond part for the issue of downward departure.          Moreover, the\n\ndownward departure related to Gonczy's medical condition.         Nowhere\n\nin the initial argument related to sentencing was that condition\n\nmentioned.\n\n           We agree with the district court that \"no fair reading of\n\n[the prosecutor's] argument to the [c]ourt would lead an impartial\n\nobserver to think that [she] thought 70 months' was an adequate\n\nsentence.\"   The district judge admonished the prosecutor, saying\n\nthat \"if you plea bargain out a case at 70 months then the entire\n\nargument should be devoted to a sentence of 70 months.\"             While\n\npaying lip service to a term of 70 months' imprisonment, the AUSA\n\nsubstantively argued for a sentence at the higher end of the\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fguidelines.   In   doing   so,   the    government   violated   the   plea\n\nagreement it entered into with Gonczy.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment and\n\nsentence and remand for resentencing.\n\n          Vacated and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f",

In this case, the substance of the prosecutor's argument at the sentencing hearing can only be understood to have emphasized Gonczy's wrongdoing and his leadership role in the offense, advocating for the imposition of a higher sentence than the agreed-upon term of 70 months.

Gonczy (\"Gonczy\") appeals his sentence on the grounds that the government breached its plea agreement with him. We vacate the judgment and sentence, and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to a plea agreement with the government, Gonczy pled guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 371; eight counts of wire fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1343; and twenty-three counts of mail fraud, in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1341. Gonczy was part of a highly sophisticated telemarketing scheme, by which a large number of timeshare owners were induced to buy an appraisal provided by Gonczy and his companies at $400 each. All appraisals, however, were worthless, no timeshare unit having ever been inspected. The government estimated that there were roughly 38,000 victims, thus causing over $15 million in collective losses to the timeshare owners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the plea agreement, the government was obligated to recommend \"incarceration at the low end of the [United States Sentencing] [G]uideline[s] range calculated by the court ....,\" although the agreement specified that such recommendation was not binding on the district court. Gonczy also specifically reserved the right to argue for a downward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the disposition hearing, the district court calculated the sentencing range to be between 70 and 87 months, which both parties agreed was within the appropriate range. However, after hearing arguments, the district court sentenced Gonczy to the top end of the range; <i>viz.</i> 84 months' imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One issue controls the outcome of Gonczy's appeal, and that is whether the government breached the plea agreement,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> for if the statements of the Assistant United States Attorney (\"AUSA\") constitute a breach of the plea agreement, we will remand for resentencing. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

An alternative remedy is to allow withdrawal of the guilty plea. <i>Santobello,</i> 404 U.S. at 263, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108416\"><a href=\"/opinion/108416/santobello-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">92</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

When a defendant does not object to the breach of the plea agreement at the sentencing hearing, this court reviews for plain error. <i>Riggs,</i> 287 F.3d at 224.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that Gonczy's counsel did not properly object because he neither stated the reason for his objection when the alleged breach occurred, nor did he request the plea be withdrawn, or ask the district court for the remedy of specific performance. The government further argues that, even if counsel effectively objected, the district court did not address the issue of the breach and Gonczy therefore waived his objections. We see it differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's argument fails not only because Gonczy's counsel did object, but because the record shows that the district court was aware of both the objection and the underlying reasons. We have held that an objection is sufficiently raised as long as it brings the purported breach of the plea agreement to the district court's attention. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

The government does not cite any authority to support its argument that counsel is required to present a more specific objection. In the present case, when the AUSA concluded her statement as to the sentencing range, Gonzcy's counsel stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Your Honor, I object to the government characterizing that what should proceed in this [c]ourt at a minimum represents the guidelines when the government has entered into a plea agreement in which they have agreed to recommend the bottom of the guidelines in connection with that plea agreement.

Nowhere in the initial argument related to sentencing was that condition mentioned.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that \"no fair reading of [the prosecutor's] argument to the [c]ourt would lead an impartial observer to think that [she] thought 70 months' was an adequate sentence.\" The district judge admonished the prosecutor, saying that \"if you plea bargain out a case at 70 months then the entire argument should be devoted to a sentence of 70 months.\" While paying lip service to a term of 70 months' imprisonment, the AUSA substantively argued for a sentence at the higher end of the guidelines. In doing so, the government violated the plea agreement it entered into with Gonczy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment and sentence and remand for resentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Vacated and Remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Columbia, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Gonczy argued that there were two issues on appeal: whether the plea agreement was breached, and whether the district judge erred in sentencing Gonczy. A breach of a plea agreement is deemed a violation of that agreement by the government, not by the sentencing judge<i>See generally Santobello v.
