The   City     of    Fall     River,\n\nMassachusetts, and the Attorneys General of Massachusetts and Rhode\n\nIsland,    filed   a   petition    in   this    court   to    compel      the   U.S.\n\nDepartment     of Transportation (DOT) to take two different actions.\n\nOne was to issue regulations that the petitioners say were required\n\nby a statute adopted many years ago; the other, to rule on a long-\n\npending petition for rulemaking.\n\n            Petitioners' ultimate target is an application filed by\n\nWeaver's Cove Energy, LLC, on December 19, 2003, to construct and\n\noperate a liquified natural gas (LNG) facility in Fall River,\n\nMassachusetts.     The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (\"FERC\")\n\ngranted the application, and a petition for review is currently\n\npending before this court in another case.              City of Fall River v.\n\nFERC,   Nos.   06-1203,   06-1204,      06-1220,      06-2146,      06-2147.      In\n\ngranting     the   application,     FERC      noted   that    it    was     applying\n\nregulations governing LNG facilities adopted by DOT. Weaver's Cove\n\nEnergy, LLC, 112 F.E.R.C. 61,070, 61,534 (July 15, 2005).\n\n            The regulations applied by FERC were promulgated by DOT\n\nin February 1980, see Liquified Natural Gas Facilities; New Federal\n\nSafety Standards, 45 Fed. Reg. 9,184 (Feb. 11, 1980) (to be\n\ncodified at 49 C.F.R. pt. 193), pursuant to a statutory directive\n\nadopted by Congress in November 1979.            See Pipeline Safety Act of\n\n1979, Pub. L. No. 96-129, § 152(a), 93 Stat. 989, 999 (1979)\n\n(codified at 49 U.S.C. § 60103(a) (2000)).                   It is petitioners'\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fposition that the regulations do not directly address the safe\n\nsiting of LNG facilities and therefore do not satisfy the statute.\n\nAfter Weaver's Cove filed its application, the petitioners filed a\n\npetition for rulemaking with DOT in September 2004 asking it to\n\nadopt revised regulations to address safe siting.\n\n           DOT has repeatedly taken the position that its original\n\nregulations did address safe siting and complied with the 1979\n\nstatute.   It did not take any immediate action on the petition for\n\nrulemaking.   After that petition had been pending for nearly two\n\nyears, petitioners filed the present mandamus petition with this\n\ncourt asking that we compel DOT (1) to adopt regulations to address\n\nsafe siting and (2) to act on petitioners' petition for rulemaking.\n\n           DOT and Weaver's Cove oppose the petition for mandamus.\n\nThey argue that the petitioners' second request (to compel a ruling\n\non the petition for rulemaking) is moot, which petitioners concede:\n\nthis is because on October 25, 2006, DOT finally acted on the\n\npetition by denying it.   U.S. Dep't of Transp., Re: Petition for\n\nRulemaking by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of\n\nRhode Island (No. PHMSA-2004-19208, Oct. 25, 2006).1\n\n           As to the first request (to compel compliance with the\n\n1979 statute), DOT and Weaver's Cove make three arguments: (1)\n\nthat the requirements for mandamus are not met, (2) that the\n\n\n     1\n      The petitioners in this case have just appealed from the\ndenial by the Acting Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety to\nthe DOT administrator by an appeal dated November 13, 2006.\n\n                                -4-\n\frequest is an out-of-time challenge to earlier regulations,2 and\n\n(3) (if the court reaches the merits) that the existing regulations\n\ndo address safe siting.           We agree that the requirements for\n\nmandamus are not met and decline to address the other two issues of\n\ntimeliness and the merits.\n\n           Mandamus is regarded as an extraordinary writ reserved\n\nfor special situations.     Among its ordinary preconditions are that\n\nthe agency or official have acted (or failed to act) in disregard\n\nof a clear legal duty and that there be no adequate conventional\n\nmeans for review.    In re Bluewater Network & Ocean Advocates, 234\n\nF.3d 1305, 1315 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Telecomm. Research & Action Ctr.\n\nv. FCC, 750 F.2d 70, 78 (D.C. Cir. 1984).\n\n           Final agency action, including a final refusal to act, is\n\nordinarily reviewable in a federal court; if no specific statutory\n\nscheme is provided, the Administrative Procedure Act permits a\n\ndistrict   court   action   for   injunctive   relief,   5   U.S.C.   §   702\n\n(2000)--the traditional standby means for review of government\n\naction where no more specific statute controls.          E.g., 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2342 (2000).      The question, then, is why mandamus should be\n\nconsidered in the face of this conventional review mechanism.\n\n\n\n     2\n      The timeliness issue arises because the 1979 statute provides\nfor review by petition to an appropriate circuit court of the\noriginal regulations under the statute and any amendments to them,\nbut also fixes a relatively short time limit for the filing of such\npetitions. 49 U.S.C. § 1675(a) (1980) (recodified at 49 U.S.C.\n§ 60119(a) (2000)).\n\n                                    -5-\n\f          One might expect, for example, that the petitioners could\n\nask the agency to adopt site safety standards, arguing that the\n\npresent standards are inadequate, and then seek judicial review if\n\nand when the agency denied this request.                It may be that the DOT's\n\nrecent denial of petitioners' petition for rulemaking would, after\n\nexhaustion     of    internal    remedies,       be    a    possible   vehicle    for\n\nobtaining the judicial review they seek; but this is an issue we\n\nneed not pursue.       The point is that, questioned at oral argument,\n\ncounsel for petitioners could not explain why such a conventional\n\nmeans was inadequate.\n\n          It    is    unclear    whether     DOT      would   argue    that   such   a\n\npetition seeking new regulations was itself subject to the time bar\n\n(see note 2, above); but if there were such a bar it could hardly\n\nbe   avoided    by    using     mandamus    as        the   vehicle    for    attack.\n\nPetitioners' counsel also complained that when new regulations are\n\nsought, DOT regulations require the petitioner to describe the new\n\nregulations desired; but it is hard to see why petitioners could\n\nnot describe what they want.\n\n          Petitioners' counsel implied in oral argument that any\n\ninsistence on the formalities of conventional review was a waste of\n\ntime since the case would reemerge in this court in due course.\n\nThat is far from clear.           And, even if it were true, the fact\n\nremains that no good reason whatever has yet been provided to us\n\nfor by-passing ordinary procedures for review of agency action.\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f          Insofar as the petition sought to compel the agency to\n\nact on the petition for rulemaking, the request for mandamus is\n\ndismissed as moot.   In all other respects, the petition is denied.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",

In granting the application, FERC noted that it was applying regulations governing LNG facilities adopted by DOT. <i>Weaver's</i> <i>Cove Energy, LLC,</i> 112 FERC 61070, 61534, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2005</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1655878</span></span> (July 15, 2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The regulations applied by FERC were promulgated by DOT in February 1980, <i>see</i> Liquified Natural Gas Facilities; New Federal Safety Standards, 45 Fed.Reg. 9,184 (Feb. 11, 1980) (to be codified at 49 C.F.R. pt. 193), pursuant to a statutory directive adopted by Congress in November 1979. <i>See</i> Pipeline Safety Act of 1979, Pub.L. No. 96-129, &#167; 152(a), 93 Stat. 989, 999 (1979) (codified at 49 U.S.C. &#167; 60103(a) (2000)). It is petitioners' position that the regulations do not directly address the safe siting of LNG facilities and therefore do not satisfy the statute. After Weaver's Cove filed its application, the petitioners filed a petition for rulemaking with DOT in September 2004 asking it to adopt revised regulations to address safe siting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DOT has repeatedly taken the position that its original regulations did address safe siting and complied with the 1979 statute. It did not take any immediate action on the petition for rulemaking. After that petition had been pending for nearly two years, petitioners filed the present mandamus petition with this court asking that we compel DOT (1) to adopt regulations to address safe siting and (2) to act on petitioners' petition for rulemaking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">DOT and Weaver's Cove oppose the petition for mandamus. They argue that the petitioners' second request (to compel a ruling on the petition for rulemaking) is moot, which petitioners concede: this is because on October 25, 2006, DOT finally acted on the petition by denying it. U.S. Dep't of Transp., Re: Petition for Rulemaking by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the State of Rhode Island (No. PHMSA-2004-19208, Oct. 25, 2006).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first request (to compel compliance with the 1979 statute), DOT and Weaver's Cove make three arguments: (1) that the requirements for mandamus are not met, (2) that the request is an out-of-time challenge to earlier regulations,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> and (3) (if the court reaches the merits) that the existing regulations do address safe siting. We agree that the requirements for mandamus are not met and decline to address the other two issues of timeliness and the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mandamus is regarded as an extraordinary writ reserved for special situations. Among its ordinary preconditions are that the agency or official have acted (or failed to act) in disregard of a clear legal duty and that there be no adequate conventional means for review. <i>In re Bluewater Network &amp; Ocean Advocates,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185300\"><a href=\"/opinion/185300/in-re-bluewater-ad/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1305</span></a></span>, 1315 (D.C.Cir.2000); <i>Telecomm.

The question, then, is why mandamus should be considered in the face of this conventional review mechanism.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One might expect, for example, that the petitioners could ask the agency to adopt site safety standards, arguing that the present standards are inadequate, and then seek judicial review if and when the agency denied this request. It may be that the DOT's recent denial of petitioners' petition for rulemaking would, after exhaustion of internal remedies, be a possible vehicle for obtaining the judicial review they seek; but this is an issue we need not pursue. The point is that, questioned at oral argument, counsel for petitioners could not explain why such a conventional means was inadequate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is unclear whether DOT would argue that such a petition seeking new regulations was itself subject to the time bar (<i>see</i> note 2, above); but if there were such a bar it could hardly be avoided by using mandamus as the vehicle for attack. Petitioners' counsel also complained that when new regulations are sought, DOT regulations require the petitioner to describe the new regulations desired; but it is hard to see why petitioners could not describe what they want.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Petitioners' counsel implied in oral argument that any insistence on the formalities of conventional review was a waste of time since the case would reemerge in this court in due course. That is far from clear. And, even if it were true, the fact remains that no good reason whatever has yet been provided to us for by-passing ordinary procedures for review of agency action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Insofar as the petition sought to compel the agency to act on the petition for rulemaking, the request for mandamus is <i>dismissed</i> as moot. In all other respects, the petition is <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The petitioners in this case have just appealed from the denial by the Acting Associate Administrator for Pipeline Safety to the DOT administrator by an appeal dated November 13, 2006</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The timeliness issue arises because the 1979 statute provides for review by petition to an appropriate circuit court of the original regulations under the statute and any amendments to them, but also fixes a relatively short time limit for the filing of such petitions. 49 U.S.C. &#167; 1675(a) (1980) (recodified at 49 U.S.C. &#167; 60119(a) (2000))</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
