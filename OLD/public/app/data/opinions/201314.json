A federal grand jury sitting in\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico indicted defendants-appellants Nelson\n\nJ. Del Rosario and Pedro Pacheco, along with a third man, Miguel\n\nPérez,     on   charges   of   conspiring   to   distribute   controlled\n\nsubstances.     See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a), 846.      The operative bill —\n\nthe superseding indictment handed up on May 2, 2001 — also charged\n\nDel Rosario with two counts of possession of large quantities of\n\ncocaine and heroin, respectively, with intent to distribute the\n\nsame.    See id. § 841(a)(1).     Pérez disappeared after posting bail\n\nand is still a fugitive.       Del Rosario and Pacheco maintained their\n\ninnocence.\n\n            At a joint trial, a jury found the appellants guilty as\n\ncharged.    The district court sentenced Del Rosario to a 151-month\n\nincarcerative term and Pacheco to a 235-month incarcerative term.\n\nIn these appeals, both men claim that the government failed to\n\npresent sufficient evidence to ground their convictions.        Each man\n\nalso challenges a different evidentiary ruling.        Finally, Pacheco\n\nquestions the constitutionality of his sentence.          Finding their\n\narguments unpersuasive, we affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n             We first trace the anatomy of the government's case and\n\nthen describe the trial.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f                              A.     The Facts.\n\n            In   reviewing    challenges      to   the    sufficiency       of   the\n\nevidence in criminal cases, we take the trial record in the light\n\nmost favorable to the government.           See United States v. Maraj, 947\n\nF.2d 520, 522 (1st Cir. 1991).        Viewing the evidence in that light,\n\nthe jury could have found the following facts.\n\n            On July 29, 2000, an unnamed informant told the Drug\n\nEnforcement Administration (DEA) about drug-trafficking activity\n\nallegedly taking place in the American Airlines terminal at the\n\ninternational airport that serves San Juan, Puerto Rico.                         DEA\n\nagents    placed   the    terminal    under    surveillance.          Two   agents\n\nstationed outside the building watched as Del Rosario and two\n\ncompanions    (Charlie     James   and    Leonardo       Ramírez)   entered       the\n\nterminal    through   a   secured-access       door      reserved   for     airline\n\npersonnel.    Each man was pulling a suitcase on rollers.              The agents\n\nalerted    colleagues     stationed      inside    the    terminal,    who       then\n\napprehended the trio as they separately approached a gate at which\n\na New York-bound flight waited.           Ramírez consented to a search of\n\nhis suitcase.      That search revealed several individually wrapped\n\npackages of what appeared to be narcotics.\n\n             At that point, the DEA agents arrested all three men,\n\nescorted them to the DEA's airport office, and conducted consensual\n\nsearches of James's and Del Rosario's luggage.               Each suitcase was\n\nfound to contain bundles similar to those previously found in\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fRamírez's roll-along baggage.    Laboratory tests later showed that\n\nall three suitcases were laden with drugs.       Del Rosario's held\n\napproximately twenty kilograms of cocaine and one and one-half\n\nkilograms of heroin.\n\n            The agents also found a few other items of interest.   On\n\nDel Rosario's person, they discovered a printed itinerary for an\n\nunconsummated return trip to New York.    From James, they seized a\n\nprepaid cellular phone and an unused airline ticket for the waiting\n\nSan Juan to New York flight.   A search of Ramírez's person revealed\n\na similar ticket. These items were introduced into evidence at the\n\ntrial.\n\n            Shortly before the threesome entered the terminal, their\n\nassociates, Pacheco and Pérez, had stationed themselves inside as\n\nlookouts.    When they saw the agents swoop down upon their cohorts,\n\nPacheco and Pérez lost no time in boarding the flight to New York.\n\nRamírez provided the agents with descriptions of the two men and\n\nidentified them as the owners of the contraband.   DEA agents in New\n\nYork arrested Pacheco and Pérez upon their debarkation and seized\n\nprepaid cellular phones from each of them.\n\n            With this brief introduction, we turn to the trial\n\nitself.     Additional facts will be revealed both in the course of\n\nthat discussion and in the ensuing analysis of the assignments of\n\nerror.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f                                 B.     The Trial.\n\n             Ramírez pleaded guilty to a felony drug offense and\n\nbecame   a    government      witness.        At       the   appellants'   trial,    he\n\ntestified     that     Del    Rosario      initially         had   recruited   him   to\n\nparticipate in a scheme to ferry drugs from San Juan to New York.\n\nAt a meeting in New York on July 21, 2000, Del Rosario introduced\n\nRamírez to Pacheco and the three men discussed compensation issues.\n\nThe next day, they left for Puerto Rico to retrieve a shipment of\n\ndrugs.       That    trip    proved   to    be     a    washout    and   the   would-be\n\ntraffickers agreed to return the following weekend to consummate\n\nthe transaction.\n\n             The threesome flew back to New York and, in furtherance\n\nof their agreement, returned to San Juan on July 28.                     They met with\n\nPérez that same day.         The next day, Pérez and James drove the group\n\nto the airport.        Pérez instructed Ramírez to take a suitcase from\n\nthe van, wait for Del Rosario and James, and follow them through\n\nthe secured door into the terminal.                    Ramírez did as he was told.\n\nWhen James appeared, Ramírez overheard him talking on a cellular\n\nphone, relaying        the    group's      location      to    another   party.      The\n\ngovernment later entered into evidence the call logs from prepaid\n\ncellular phones ostensibly seized from Pacheco, James, and Pérez.\n\nThese logs showed that the cellular phones seized from Pacheco and\n\nJames were constantly communicating with each other on the day of\n\nthe arrests.        The last call between the two was logged at 8:53 p.m.\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f(roughly the time that the DEA agents observed Del Rosario, James,\n\nand Ramírez entering the terminal).\n\n           The jury also heard testimony from an American Airlines\n\nticket agent attesting to airline reservations that had been made\n\nin the names of each of the five participants in the scheme.      The\n\nagent related that the tickets assigned to Pacheco, Del Rosario,\n\nJames, and Ramírez on the July 29 San Juan to New York flight were\n\nbought at a single New York travel agency and were numbered\n\nsequentially.   This tended to confirm Ramírez's testimony that\n\nPacheco personally had booked the group's air travel and had\n\nunderwritten its cost.\n\n           After the government completed its case in chief, both\n\ndefendants moved for judgments of acquittal based on the alleged\n\ninsufficiency of the evidence.      See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a).   The\n\ndistrict court denied these motions.     The appellants proceeded to\n\nintroduce evidence in their own defense.    They did not renew their\n\nRule 29 motions once they had rested.       The court's charge, the\n\nverdict, and the imposition of sentences followed, as did these\n\nappeals.\n\nII.   SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n           Under ordinary circumstances, we review the grant or\n\ndenial of motions for judgment of acquittal de novo. United States\n\nv. Hernandez, 146 F.3d 30, 32 (1st Cir. 1998).    Here, however, the\n\ncircumstances are not ordinary.     \"A defendant who elects to adduce\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fevidence in [his] defense after the district court has denied a\n\nRule 29 motion made at the close of the government's case is deemed\n\nto have abandoned the earlier motion and waived any objection to\n\nits denial.\"    United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 290 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).     So it is here:        the appellants' failure to renew their\n\nearlier motions for judgment of acquittal after presenting evidence\n\npretermits    the   usual   de    novo    review.      See    United    States   v.\n\nHadfield, 918 F.2d 987, 996 (1st Cir. 1990).                 Instead, we inquire\n\ninto the evidentiary sufficiency of the government's case only to\n\nensure against clear and gross injustice.             United States v. Stein,\n\n233 F.3d 6, 20 (1st Cir. 2000);                Hadfield, 918 F.2d at 996.        We\n\nfind no hint of injustice here.\n\n            The conspiracy statute under which the appellants were\n\nconvicted provides that \"[a]ny person who attempts or conspires to\n\ncommit any [federal drug] offense . . . shall be subject to the\n\nsame penalties as those prescribed for the offense.\"                   21 U.S.C. §\n\n846.     To ground a conviction under this statute, the government\n\nmust \"show beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy existed and\n\nthat a defendant agreed to participate in it, intending to commit\n\nthe underlying substantive offense.\"              United States v. Sepulveda,\n\n15 F.3d 1161, 1173 (1st Cir. 1993).               The government may meet its\n\nburden of proof by direct evidence, circumstantial evidence, or any\n\ncombination of the two.      United States v. Marrero-Ortiz, 160 F.3d\n\n768, 772 (1st Cir. 1998).         \"[B]oth the conspiracy's existence and\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fa particular defendant's participation in it may be inferred from\n\nthe    members'    words   and   actions    and   the    interdependence   of\n\nactivities and persons involved.\" United States v. Ortiz de Jesus,\n\n230 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2000) (quoting United States v. Boylan, 898\n\nF.2d 230, 241-42 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n             We need not tarry.        In this case, the testimony of\n\nRamírez points directly to the existence of an express agreement\n\namong a band of coconspirators that included both appellants.              He\n\nmet face to face with Del Rosario and Pacheco, directly implicated\n\nthem    in   the    drug-trafficking       scheme,      and   detailed   their\n\nparticipation (citing book and verse).            Ramírez's testimony alone\n\nis adequate to sustain the conspiracy convictions.                 See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Martínez-Medina, 279 F.3d 105, 115 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(explaining that uncorroborated testimony of a government informant\n\nis sufficient for conviction if the testimony \"is not incredible or\n\ninsubstantial on its face\") (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see also Ortiz de Jesus, 230 F.3d at 6.\n\n             In an endeavor to parry this thrust, Pacheco charges that\n\nRamírez's testimony was unworthy of credence and compromised by\n\ninconsistencies.      This charge overlooks that judgments as to a\n\nwitness's veracity (or lack of veracity) ordinarily are for the\n\njury, not for an appellate court.            See, e.g., United States v.\n\nFranky-Ortiz, 230 F.3d 405, 407 (1st Cir. 2000); United States v.\n\nO'Brien, 14 F.3d 703, 707 (1st Cir. 1994).               The jury is free to\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fcredit    or     discount   testimony    depending   upon   its    collective\n\nevaluation of a witness's credibility.           O'Brien, 14 F.3d at 707.\n\nAnd, similarly, the existence and effect of any inconsistencies are\n\ngrist for the jury's mill.           See, e.g., United States v. Carroll,\n\n105 F.3d 740, 743 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Romero, 32 F.3d\n\n641, 646 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n               In this instance, Pacheco's trial counsel ably cross-\n\nexamined Ramírez and forcefully attacked the latter's credibility\n\nduring closing argument.          The jurors saw and heard the witness and\n\nwere at liberty to make their own informed assessment of his\n\ntruthfulness. For present purposes, it is conclusive that the jury\n\napparently accepted Ramírez's account.               See United States v.\n\nAlicea, 205 F.3d 480, 483 (1st Cir. 2000) (explaining that \"a jury\n\nhas the prerogative to credit some parts of a witness's testimony\n\nand disregard other potentially contradictory portions\").\n\n               To be sure, the appellants note that Ramírez was hip-deep\n\nin the plot and emphasize the inherent unreliability of accomplice\n\ntestimony.      But that too was for the jury.       It would revolutionize\n\nthe trial of criminal cases if the turncoat status of a cooperating\n\nwitness was enough to strip his testimony of probative value as a\n\nmatter of law.       There is no such rule.     See id.\n\n            In addition to challenging his conspiracy conviction, Del\n\nRosario also challenges his convictions on the two substantive\n\ncounts.         Those   counts,    charging   possession    with   intent   to\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fdistribute, arise out of the same nucleus of operative facts:                          the\n\nJuly 29 airport incident.            The first of them (count 2) charged that\n\nDel Rosario, at that time and place, knowingly possessed five or\n\nmore kilograms of cocaine with intent to distribute.                         The second\n\n(count 3) charged that, at the same time and place, he knowingly\n\npossessed      one     or    more    kilograms     of    heroin       with   intent     to\n\ndistribute.\n\n               Del Rosario initially argues that the government never\n\nproved that he possessed either the cocaine or the heroin.                          This is\n\nsheer persiflage.            For purposes of the statute of conviction, 21\n\nU.S.C.     §    841(a)(1),          possession    may     be    either       actual     or\n\nconstructive.        United States v. Bergodere, 40 F.3d 512, 518 (1st\n\nCir. 1994). Actual possession is \"the state of immediate, hands-on\n\nphysical possession.\"           United States v. Zavala Maldonado, 23 F.3d\n\n4, 6 (1st Cir. 1994).                Constructive possession \"exists when a\n\nperson knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to\n\nexercise dominion and control over an object, either directly or\n\nthrough others.\"            United States v. Ocampo-Guarin, 968 F.2d 1406,\n\n1409   (1st     Cir.    1992)    (citation       and    internal      quotation      marks\n\nomitted). In a drug case, constructive possession \"may be inferred\n\nfrom   a   defendant's        dominion    and     control      over    an    area    where\n\nnarcotics are found.\"            United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675,\n\n678 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\f           In this case, the evidence shows that Del Rosario, having\n\naccepted an assignment to transport drugs from San Juan to New\n\nYork, removed a suitcase (later found to contain narcotics) from\n\nthe back of a van and wheeled it through a restricted-access\n\nairport door.     He was seen straddling this suitcase with his legs\n\nas he awaited a boarding call for his New York flight.              These facts\n\nare   capable    of   supporting    an   inference    of   either    actual   or\n\nconstructive possession.\n\n           Del    Rosario's   claim      that   the   government     failed   to\n\nestablish his intent to distribute cocaine and heroin is equally\n\nunavailing.      On this record, the illation that he knew this\n\nsuitcase   was    packed   with    narcotics    was   an   easy   (and   wholly\n\nreasonable) one for jurors to draw.             Del Rosario's claim to the\n\ncontrary ignores, among other things, the axiomatic principle that\n\n\"an intent to distribute drugs can legitimately be inferred from\n\nfactors such as quantity and purity.\"           Id.\n\n           To illustrate, the DEA agents found twenty-one packages\n\nin Del Rosario's suitcase.         One distinctively wrapped parcel was\n\ntested separately and found to contain between 665 and 690 grams of\n\nheroin (the record does not contain any information as to its\n\npurity). When the DEA tested the twenty remaining packages, one of\n\nthem was shown to contain 787 grams of heroin, 71% pure.              The other\n\nnineteen parcels contained, in the ensemble, 19.89 kilograms of\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fcocaine, 79% pure.1      The large quantity of contraband found in Del\n\nRosario's possession warrants the inferences that he knew the drugs\n\nwould be released into the stream of commerce and that he intended\n\nto facilitate that action.        See United States v. Smith, 680 F.2d\n\n255, 260 (1st Cir. 1982) (\"Neither juries nor judges are required\n\nto divorce themselves of common sense, but rather should apply to\n\nfacts which they find proven such reasonable inferences as are\n\njustified in the light of their experience as to the natural\n\ninclinations of human beings.\").\n\n            That ends this aspect of the matter.                 The evidence\n\npresented   at   trial   was    more    than   sufficient   to   sustain   the\n\nappellants' convictions.\n\nIII. EVIDENTIARY RULINGS\n\n            The appellants variously assign error to two evidentiary\n\nrulings.    We discuss them separately.\n\n                         A.    The Cellular Phone.\n\n            Pacheco complains that the government never proved that\n\nhe was in possession of the cellular phone used to converse with\n\nJames on July 29.    His plaint focuses on the lack of foundation for\n\nreferences to the phone that were made at trial by Brian Geraghty,\n\na DEA agent.     We set the stage.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Ramírez's and James's suitcases contained, respectively, 18.9\nand 19.88 kilograms of 80% pure cocaine.\n\n                                       -13-\n\f             The record reflects that a cellular phone was taken from\n\nPacheco in New York.        Geraghty, however, was in San Juan at the\n\ntime.     He later participated in the receipt and processing of a\n\ncellular phone at the DEA's San Juan office.           He was told that the\n\nphone was Pacheco's and he inventoried it as such.              However, he had\n\nno personal knowledge of that fact.           The agent who seized the phone\n\ndid not testify, and there was no first-hand evidence as to how the\n\nphone traversed the miles from New York to San Juan.\n\n             During   Geraghty's      trial   testimony,   he    alluded   to   a\n\n\"telephone that was taken from Mr. Pacheco.\"                    This reference\n\noccurred despite the absence of any foundational evidence, to that\n\npoint, that a phone had been seized when Pacheco was detained.                The\n\nallusion     inspired   a   vaguely    phrased    objection,     to   which   the\n\ndistrict court responded that Pacheco's counsel \"need[ed] to bring\n\nthat up outside of the hearing of the jury.\"               Pacheco's counsel\n\nnever followed through on this suggestion.\n\n             Geraghty essayed several other references to the cellular\n\nphone. On one of these occasions, Pacheco's counsel began to state\n\nan objection.      The district court cut her off in mid-sentence.2\n\n\n     2\n         The colloquy between the lawyer and the judge was as follows:\n\n     MS. APONTE:     The objection was that the witness\n     [Geraghty] was with Mr. Pacheco when the telephone was\n     occupied. So if he is testifying as to something he was\n     outside of the presence —\n\n     THE COURT: Overruled. The jury heard the circumstance\n     in which the telephone was seized. They heard it today,\n\n                                       -14-\n\fPacheco now asks us to review the admissibility of the agent's\n\nstatement that the phone was seized from his person.\n\n          There is a serious question as to the applicable standard\n\nof review.   Two difficulties are apparent.      First, the court\n\ninvited defense counsel to take the matter up outside the jury's\n\nearshot, and the record does not reflect that counsel ever did so.3\n\nCf. Cottrill v. Sparrow, Johnson & Ursillo, Inc., 100 F.3d 220, 224\n\nn.2 (1st Cir. 1996) (stating that an appellant who declines the\n\ncourt's invitation to seek modification of an order waives the\n\nissue for purposes of appeal).      This likely was a waiver.   The\n\n\n     as a matter of fact —\n\n     MS. APONTE:   Your Honor.\n\n     THE COURT: — so the jury can deal with that. You can\n     argue your case at an appropriate time in front of the\n     jury.   This is not closing argument.     We are just\n     receiving evidence.\n\nIn his brief, Pacheco indicates that the phrase \"the witness was\nwith Mr. Pacheco\" should read \"the witness was not with Mr.\nPacheco\" (emphasis supplied). It is unclear whether the absence of\nthe word \"not\" was caused by misspeaking or by mistranscription.\nIn all events, Pacheco is bound by the transcript as it stands, as\nhe never requested the district court to correct the phrasing. See\nFed. R. App. P. 10(e)(1) (explaining that disputes arising over the\naccuracy of the trial record ordinarily must be submitted to and\nsettled by the district court).\n     3\n      In his briefing, Pacheco claims that the trial judge\nspontaneously withdrew the invitation and overruled the objection\nbefore a sidebar conference could take place. The record, however,\nis silent in this regard — and it is a party's affirmative\nresponsibility to \"furnish the court of appeals with so much of the\nrecord of the proceedings below as is necessary to enable informed\nappellate review.\"   Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 87 (1st Cir.\n1999).\n\n                                 -15-\n\fsecond obstacle is that a party objecting to particular evidence is\n\nobliged to make \"a timely objection or motion to strike . . .\n\nstating the specific ground of objection,\" at least where that\n\nground was not apparent from the context. Fed. R. Evid. 103(a)(1).\n\nThe purpose behind this rule is to ensure that a litigant will\n\n\"call his specific objection to the attention of the trial judge,\n\nso as to alert the judge to the proper course of action.\"     United\n\nStates v. Holmquist, 36 F.3d 154, 168 (1st Cir. 1994) (citation,\n\ninternal quotation marks, and brackets omitted).   Should either of\n\nthese obstacles prove insuperable, review would be limited to plain\n\nerror.\n\n          Here, however, there are some mitigating factors.   Chief\n\namong them is the trial judge's interruption of the lawyer as she\n\nwas apparently attempting to state the grounds for her objection.\n\nThat might suffice to excuse the procedural default.    Cf. United\n\nStates v. Toribio-Lugo, 376 F.3d 33, 41 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"A lawyer\n\nought not to be required to persist stubbornly when the judge has\n\nmade it perfectly clear that he does not wish to hear what the\n\nlawyer has to say.\").\n\n          In the final analysis, we need not probe too deeply into\n\nwhether Pacheco preserved the point. Here, all roads lead to Rome:\n\nwhatever the standard of review, the error was harmless.\n\n          The error itself is manifest.   Geraghty's only knowledge\n\nof the phone's provenance was second-hand. The agent who seized it\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fdid not testify, and the government never established a chain of\n\ncustody tracing the phone from Pacheco's carryall to Geraghty's\n\nhands.   See United States v. Ladd, 885 F.2d 954, 956-57 (1st Cir.\n\n1989) (describing chain of custody requirements).                    We conclude,\n\ntherefore,    that    there    was   no   sound       basis   for   admitting   the\n\nreferences linking Pacheco to the cellular phone.\n\n            Notwithstanding the fact that the government used the\n\nphone and the call logs emanating from it to show communication\n\nbetween Pacheco and James on the day of the arrest, this error was\n\nharmless.     \"Where, as here, an error is not of constitutional\n\nmagnitude, reversal is not obligatory unless the bevue 'affect[s]\n\nsubstantial rights.'\" Id. at 957 (quoting Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a)).\n\nIn determining whether an error affects substantial rights, we ask\n\nwhether we can say, \"with fair assurance, after pondering all that\n\nhappened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,\n\nthat the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\"\n\nKotteakos    v.    United    States,   328     U.S.    750,   765   (1946).     The\n\nKotteakos \"fair assurance\" standard requires a substantial degree\n\nof probability, but it does not require that the error be shown to\n\nbe harmless beyond any reasonable doubt.                 See Ladd, 885 F.2d at\n\n957.\n\n             In applying the Kotteakos test, a reviewing court must\n\nengage in \"a panoramic, case-specific inquiry considering, among\n\nother    things,     the    centrality    of    the     tainted     material,   its\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\funiqueness, its prejudicial impact, the uses to which it was put\n\nduring the trial, the relative strengths of the parties' cases, and\n\nany telltales that furnish clues to the likelihood that the error\n\naffected   the   factfinder's       resolution   of    a     material   issue.\"\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1182.        The error of which Pacheco complains\n\nis analogous to the one that we found harmless in Ladd.\n\n           First, the point that the government sought to prove by\n\nintroducing   the   cell   phone     evidence    —    that    Pacheco   was    in\n\ncommunication    with   the   men    carrying    the    drugs    —   had   been\n\nestablished by other evidence before Geraghty took the stand.                 And\n\nthere was more.     The jury heard from Ramírez that Pacheco had\n\nfacilitated the group's air travel to and from Puerto Rico and had\n\nexplained the financial terms of the drug deal to the recruits.\n\nThen, too, the supervisor of the DEA surveillance team testified\n\nthat Pacheco was in the terminal at the time of the incident,\n\nacting in a manner that suggested countersurveillance.               Last — but\n\nfar from least — the consecutively numbered airline tickets paid\n\nfor by Pacheco and issued in his and his cohorts' names were a\n\npowerful indicium of his pivotal role in the plot.                Because the\n\nproof of Pacheco's culpability was abundant and the probative value\n\nof the cell phone testimony, in itself, was modest, we think it\n\nhighly unlikely that the exclusion of that testimony would have\n\ninfluenced the jury's verdict.          See United States v. Piper, 298\n\n\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fF.3d 47, 58 (1st Cir. 2002) (explaining that evidence deemed\n\n\"cumulative\" is generally thought to be harmless).\n\n            The second point of similarity with the Ladd analysis is\n\nthe effect of the challenged testimony on the defendant's trial\n\nstrategy.    See Ladd, 885 F.2d at 958.        Pacheco's defense at trial\n\nconsisted of an alibi:       the testimony of two nieces who claimed\n\nthat he had remained in Puerto Rico between July 23 and July 29.\n\nThat testimony, if believed, would have contradicted Ramírez's\n\ntestimony that Pacheco repaired to New York during that interval,\n\nmade the necessary arrangements for the pickup, and returned to\n\nPuerto Rico on July 28 with his \"mules.\"                 The impermissible\n\nreferences to the use of the cell phone in Puerto Rico on July 29,\n\nhowever, are not in any way inconsistent with Pacheco's alibi\n\ndefense and therefore could have no bearing on it.             This lack of\n\ncentrality supports a finding of harmlessness.\n\n            For   these   reasons,    we    conclude   that,   whatever   the\n\nstandard of review, the lower court's admission of the cell phone\n\ntestimony constituted harmless error.\n\n                    B.    The Search of the Suitcase.\n\n            In an attempt to remove the most incriminating piece of\n\nevidence from the mix, Del Rosario challenges the district court's\n\ndenial of his motion to suppress the contents of the suitcase.4\n\n\n     4\n      The district judge originally sent the motion to suppress to\na magistrate judge. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B). The magistrate\njudge held an evidentiary hearing and recommended denial of the\n\n                                     -19-\n\fDel Rosario trains his fire on the district court's determination\n\nthat the DEA agents secured Del Rosario's valid consent to conduct\n\nthe search.   As framed, this argument calls into question the\n\ncourt's subsidiary findings of fact.   We review these findings for\n\nclear error, see United States v. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st\n\nCir. 1994), while affording plenary review to the district court's\n\nultimate constitutional conclusion that Del Rosario's rights were\n\nnot violated, see United States v. Laine, 270 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n          Two witnesses appeared at the suppression hearing:   Del\n\nRosario and DEA supervisor Elvin Laboy.     They offered differing\n\naccounts of the events that took place inside the DEA's airport\n\noffice. Laboy testified that Del Rosario admitted ownership of the\n\nsuitcase and freely consented to a search of it.5      Del Rosario\n\n\nmotion.    Del Rosario then filed a timely objection to the\nmagistrate judge's report.     The district judge overruled this\nobjection and adopted the magistrate's reasoning. For simplicity's\nsake, we do not distinguish between the two judicial officers, but,\nrather, take an institutional view and refer to the determinations\nbelow as those of the district court. See, e.g., United States v.\nMaldonado, 356 F.3d 130, 134 n.1 (1st Cir. 2004).\n     5\n      Although his brief is unclear on the point, Del Rosario\nappears to be making a poorly developed argument that Laboy's\ntestimony included hearsay and, thus, should not have been\nconsidered. That argument is hopeless. For one thing, Del Rosario\nmade no contemporaneous objection to the testimony. See United\nStates v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 773 (1st Cir. 1995) (explaining\nthat an appellant's burden increases substantially when he has\nfailed to advance a contemporaneous objection). For another thing,\ntestimony given at a suppression hearing is not subject to the\nusual proscriptions against hearsay evidence. See Fed. R. Evid.\n104(a); see also United States v. Schaefer, 87 F.3d 562, 570 (1st\n\n                               -20-\n\ftestified that Laboy was not even present when the suitcase was\n\nopened and that he never consented to a search.\n\n            Weighing the two sharply conflicting narratives, the\n\ndistrict court found Laboy truthful and rejected Del Rosario's\n\nversion.    Since Laboy's testimony is plausible on its face and not\n\ninconsistent with the other information that is known about the\n\nevents in question,6 the district court's finding demands our\n\nrespect.     See United States v. Weidul, 325 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (explaining that \"a district court's choice between two\n\nplausible competing interpretations of the facts cannot be clearly\n\nerroneous\"); Jackson v. United States, 156 F.3d 230, 232-33 (1st\n\nCir. 1998) (similar).\n\n            As   a   fallback,   Del   Rosario   offers   an   alternative\n\nargument.     He suggests that any consent he might have given was\n\ntainted by coercion.     That is whistling past the graveyard.      A nisi\n\nprius court's determination that consent was voluntary is a factual\n\nfinding, not a legal one, and thus is reviewed only for clear\n\nerror.      Laine, 270 F.3d at 75.        \"The only real question for\n\n\n\nCir. 1996).\n     6\n      We reject Del Rosario's complaint that Laboy's testimony at\nthe suppression hearing contradicts a DEA record indicating that\nAgent Douglas Furlough was the person who requested the consent.\nAt trial, Furlough testified that both he and Laboy had\nparticipated in Del Rosario's initial interview, and that Laboy was\nthe one who had requested consent to open the suitcase. Moreover,\nthe agent who had prepared the original record explained that his\nstatement was based on a faulty assumption.\n\n                                   -21-\n\fappellate    review    is   whether    the   evidence   presented    at   the\n\nsuppression hearing fairly supports this finding.\" Id. The answer\n\nhere is unequivocally in the affirmative.\n\n            To be sure, Del Rosario marshals other \"facts\" in support\n\nof his coercion argument.       But these \"facts\" derive from his own\n\nuncorroborated testimony at the suppression hearing.           The district\n\ncourt declined to credit that testimony, and Laboy's testimony,\n\nunimpeached    on     cross-examination,     suggests   that   Del   Rosario\n\nanswered \"yes\" when asked for a \"simple yes or no\" answer as to\n\nwhether he would consent to an opening of the bag.               Given the\n\ndistrict court's express adoption of Laboy's testimony and its\n\nequally explicit rejection of Del Rosario's account, we discern no\n\nclear error in the determination that the necessary consent was\n\nelicited voluntarily.       See id.\n\n            At the risk of belaboring the obvious, a supportable\n\nfinding of consent eliminates the need for either a search warrant\n\nor probable cause.       See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218,\n\n219 (1973); United States v. Woodrum, 202 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).      Given the bulletproof determination that Del Rosario\n\nvoluntarily consented to the search, the district court's legal\n\nruling that the evidence was not obtained in violation of the\n\nFourth Amendment is unimpugnable.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\fIV.   SENTENCING\n\n           Our journey is not yet at an end.     Having received a 235-\n\nmonth prison sentence under the relevant provisions of the United\n\nStates Sentencing Guidelines, Pacheco now invites this court, in a\n\nsupplemental post-argument brief, to set aside his sentence on the\n\nbasis of the Supreme Court's decision in Blakely v. Washington, 124\n\nS. Ct. 2531 (2004).    We decline the invitation.\n\n           Blakely examined the constitutionality of a Washington\n\nstate sentencing scheme.      After the defendant pleaded guilty to\n\nkidnaping, the nisi prius court imposed a sentence above the\n\nstatutory maximum based on a finding of \"deliberate cruelty.\"           Id.\n\nat 2535.   The Supreme Court noted that this finding was \"neither\n\nadmitted by [the defendant] nor found by a jury,\" id. at 2537, and\n\ndeclared   the   augmented   sentence    violative   of   Blakely's   Sixth\n\nAmendment right to trial by jury, id. at 2538.            While the Court\n\nmade clear that the federal sentencing guidelines were not before\n\nit and expressed no opinion on their validity, id. at 2538 n.9, the\n\nrationale of Blakely calls into doubt their constitutionality. The\n\nSupreme Court has taken this precise question under advisement.\n\nSee United States v. Booker, No. 04-104 (argued Oct. 4, 2004);\n\nUnited States v. Fanfan, No. 04-105 (argued Oct. 4, 2004).\n\n           In Pacheco's case, the sentencing court determined, inter\n\nalia, that he was an \"organizer\" of the conspiracy, and hiked his\n\noffense level accordingly.      See USSG §3B1.1(c).       The increase in\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\fthe offense level yielded an elevated guideline sentencing range\n\nand, thus, led to a stiffer sentence.              Invoking Blakely, Pacheco\n\nnow   attempts   for    the     first    time    to   challenge    this   upward\n\nadjustment.      He    posits    that    the    crucial   fact    on   which   the\n\nadjustment depends — his role in the offense of conviction — was\n\nneither determined by the jury nor established beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.7\n\n           The most fundamental flaw in the fabric of this argument\n\nis that Pacheco failed to advance it in the district court.8                   That\n\nflaw is exacerbated because he likewise failed to raise it in his\n\npre-argument appellate briefing.           Such omissions are costly to an\n\nappellant.    See Lattab v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 17 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(explaining that an appellant may not raise new points of law for\n\nthe first time in a post-argument brief); United States v. Dietz,\n\n\n      7\n      Pacheco also suggests that the sentencing court's findings of\ndrug quantity, used to calculate his base offense level, see USSG\n§2D1.1(c)(2), are similarly infirm. The drug quantity finding was\nnot challenged below or in Pacheco's opening brief, so we reject\nthat suggestion based on the same reasoning that undergirds our\nrejection of his argument against the role-in-the-offense\nenhancement. See text infra.\n      8\n      The fact that Blakely had not been decided at that time does\nnot excuse this default. The Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi\nv. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490 (2000), foreshadowed the argument;\nand, in all events, the prospect of an adverse ruling does not\nrelieve a party of the duty of lodging a contemporaneous objection.\nSee, e.g., Derman v. United States, 298 F.3d 34, 44 (1st Cir.)\n(explaining that appellant's failure to raise an Apprendi objection\nbefore the trial court violated \"the general rule that a criminal\ndefendant must seasonably advance an objection to a potential\nconstitutional infirmity in order to preserve the point for\ncollateral attack\"), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 1048 (2002).\n\n                                        -24-\n\f950 F.2d     50,    55   (1st   Cir.    1991)   (explaining      that   sentencing\n\nobjections \"not seasonably addressed to the trial court may not be\n\nraised for the first time in an appellate venue\").\n\n             It is debatable whether these omissions, collectively,\n\nconstitute a waiver or, instead, are merely a forfeiture.                        See\n\nUnited     States   v.    Morgan,      384   F.3d    1,   7-8   (1st    Cir.   2004)\n\n(discussing this question); see also United States v. Rodriguez,\n\n311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir. 2002) (spelling out the different\n\nconsequences of waiver and forfeiture vis-à-vis appellate review),\n\ncert. denied, 538 U.S. 937 (2003).                  We need not make so fine a\n\ndistinction today.        Assuming arguendo, favorably to Pacheco, that\n\nthe plain error standard applies, he is nonetheless ineligible for\n\nrelief.9\n\n             The substantive standards for plain error review are\n\ndifficult to satisfy.           We will only reverse the trial court's\n\ndecision if a defendant demonstrates \"(1) that an error occurred\n\n(2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected\n\n[his] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\n\n\n\n     9\n      In his supplemental brief, Pacheco claims that the putative\nBlakely error was preserved (and, therefore, that the error\nengenders de novo review). The record belies that claim: at no\npoint during the sentencing proceedings did Pacheco object to the\nrole-in-the-offense enhancement or to the determination of drug\nquantity on any ground that anticipates, or even remotely\nresembles, the Blakely rationale.\n\n                                        -25-\n\fUnited States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).                     We find\n\nno plain error here.        Our conclusion rests on two bases.\n\n            The first involves timing.           The district court sentenced\n\nPacheco on November 26, 2002.             That was almost nineteen months\n\nbefore the Supreme Court decided Blakely.                    Circuit precedent in\n\nforce at the time of Pacheco's sentencing, in line with the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000),\n\nprovided that an aggravating sentencing factor did not need to be\n\npresented to a jury or proven beyond a reasonable doubt so long as\n\nthe resulting sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum.                        See\n\nUnited States v. Caba, 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding\n\nthat,   within    these     parameters,         Apprendi      permits   an     upward\n\nadjustment     for   a     defendant's         role     in    a   drug-trafficking\n\nconspiracy).      Here, the underlying offense carries a maximum\n\nsentence of life in prison.           See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A).           Whether\n\nBlakely has      fatally    undermined     this       line   of   authority    is   an\n\nunsettled    question      at   the    moment    and,    whatever    the     ultimate\n\noutcome, the answer is neither clear nor obvious.                       See United\n\nStates v. Cordoza-Estrada, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2004) [No.\n\n03-2666, slip op. at 9] (per curiam).             Accordingly, we cannot find\n\nthat the district court committed plain error when it sentenced\n\nPacheco on the basis, in part, of an upward role-in-the-offense\n\nadjustment.    See Morgan, 384 F.3d at 8.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\f             The second reason why there is no plain error involves\n\nthe fourth prong of the plain error test:                any bevue in failing to\n\nsubmit the role-in-the-offense issue to the jury did not seriously\n\naffect the fairness of the proceedings.                   See United States v.\n\nCotton, 535 U.S. 625, 631-32 (2002); Johnson v. United States, 520\n\nU.S. 461, 469-70 (1997).          We reach this conclusion because the\n\ntranscript of the disposition hearing is utterly devoid of any\n\nattack either on the Probation Department's recommendation that an\n\nupward role-in-the-offense adjustment be imposed or on the district\n\ncourt's    determination      that   Pacheco     was     the    organizer   of   the\n\nenterprise (and, thus, was deserving of such an adjustment).                      To\n\ncinch     matters,     the   facts      of     record,     including      Ramírez's\n\nidentification of Pacheco both as an \"owner\" of the drugs and as\n\nthe de facto tour director for the group's air travel, strongly\n\nsupport the conclusion that Pacheco was a driving force in the\n\nconspiracy.        Under these circumstances, any error (assuming that\n\none occurred) cannot be classified as plain.                See United States v.\n\nSavarese, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2004) [No. 04-1099, slip op.\n\nat 16-17].\n\nV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.             We conclude that the evidence\n\npresented     at    trial    supports     the    jury's        verdict;   that   the\n\nappellants' claims of reversible error, insofar as they relate to\n\nthe district court's evidentiary rulings, lack force; and that the\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\funpreserved claim of Blakely error does not afford Pacheco a\n\ncognizable   basis   for   relief.      Consequently,   we   affirm   the\n\nappellants' convictions and sentences.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\f",

A federal grand jury sitting in\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico indicted defendants-appellants Nelson\n\nJ. Del Rosario and Pedro Pacheco, along with a third man, Miguel\n\nPérez,     on   charges   of   conspiring   to   distribute   controlled\n\nsubstances.     See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a), 846.      The operative bill —\n\nthe superseding indictment handed up on May 2, 2001 — also charged\n\nDel Rosario with two counts of possession of large quantities of\n\ncocaine and heroin, respectively, with intent to distribute the\n\nsame.    See id. § 841(a)(1).     Pérez disappeared after posting bail\n\nand is still a fugitive.       Del Rosario and Pacheco maintained their\n\ninnocence.\n\n            At a joint trial, a jury found the appellants guilty as\n\ncharged.    The district court sentenced Del Rosario to a 151-month\n\nincarcerative term and Pacheco to a 235-month incarcerative term.\n\nIn these appeals, both men claim that the government failed to\n\npresent sufficient evidence to ground their convictions.        Each man\n\nalso challenges a different evidentiary ruling.        Finally, Pacheco\n\nquestions the constitutionality of his sentence.          Finding their\n\narguments unpersuasive, we affirm.\n\nI.

The Facts.\n\n            In   reviewing    challenges      to   the    sufficiency       of   the\n\nevidence in criminal cases, we take the trial record in the light\n\nmost favorable to the government.           See United States v. Maraj, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"570481\"><a href=\"/opinion/570481/united-states-v-michael-maraj-united-states-of-america-v-sterling/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 522 (1st Cir. 1991).        Viewing the evidence in that light,\n\nthe jury could have found the following facts.\n\n            On July 29, 2000, an unnamed informant told the Drug\n\nEnforcement Administration (DEA) about drug-trafficking activity\n\nallegedly taking place in the American Airlines terminal at the\n\ninternational airport that serves San Juan, Puerto Rico.                         DEA\n\nagents    placed   the    terminal    under    surveillance.          Two   agents\n\nstationed outside the building watched as Del Rosario and two\n\ncompanions    (Charlie     James   and    Leonardo       Ramírez)   entered       the\n\nterminal    through   a   secured-access       door      reserved   for     airline\n\npersonnel.    Each man was pulling a suitcase on rollers.              The agents\n\nalerted    colleagues     stationed      inside    the    terminal,    who       then\n\napprehended the trio as they separately approached a gate at which\n\na New York-bound flight waited.           Ramírez consented to a search of\n\nhis suitcase.      That search revealed several individually wrapped\n\npackages of what appeared to be narcotics.\n\n             At that point, the DEA agents arrested all three men,\n\nescorted them to the DEA's airport office, and conducted consensual\n\nsearches of James's and Del Rosario's luggage.               Each suitcase was\n\nfound to contain bundles similar to those previously found in\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fRamírez's roll-along baggage.    Laboratory tests later showed that\n\nall three suitcases were laden with drugs.       Del Rosario's held\n\napproximately twenty kilograms of cocaine and one and one-half\n\nkilograms of heroin.\n\n            The agents also found a few other items of interest.   On\n\nDel Rosario's person, they discovered a printed itinerary for an\n\nunconsummated return trip to New York.    From James, they seized a\n\nprepaid cellular phone and an unused airline ticket for the waiting\n\nSan Juan to New York flight.   A search of Ramírez's person revealed\n\na similar ticket. These items were introduced into evidence at the\n\ntrial.\n\n            Shortly before the threesome entered the terminal, their\n\nassociates, Pacheco and Pérez, had stationed themselves inside as\n\nlookouts.    When they saw the agents swoop down upon their cohorts,\n\nPacheco and Pérez lost no time in boarding the flight to New York.\n\nRamírez provided the agents with descriptions of the two men and\n\nidentified them as the owners of the contraband.   DEA agents in New\n\nYork arrested Pacheco and Pérez upon their debarkation and seized\n\nprepaid cellular phones from each of them.\n\n            With this brief introduction, we turn to the trial\n\nitself.     Additional facts will be revealed both in the course of\n\nthat discussion and in the ensuing analysis of the assignments of\n\nerror.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f                                 B.     The Trial.\n\n             Ramírez pleaded guilty to a felony drug offense and\n\nbecame   a    government      witness.        At       the   appellants'   trial,    he\n\ntestified     that     Del    Rosario      initially         had   recruited   him   to\n\nparticipate in a scheme to ferry drugs from San Juan to New York.\n\nAt a meeting in New York on July 21, 2000, Del Rosario introduced\n\nRamírez to Pacheco and the three men discussed compensation issues.\n\nThe next day, they left for Puerto Rico to retrieve a shipment of\n\ndrugs.       That    trip    proved   to    be     a    washout    and   the   would-be\n\ntraffickers agreed to return the following weekend to consummate\n\nthe transaction.\n\n             The threesome flew back to New York and, in furtherance\n\nof their agreement, returned to San Juan on July 28.                     They met with\n\nPérez that same day.         The next day, Pérez and James drove the group\n\nto the airport.        Pérez instructed Ramírez to take a suitcase from\n\nthe van, wait for Del Rosario and James, and follow them through\n\nthe secured door into the terminal.                    Ramírez did as he was told.\n\nWhen James appeared, Ramírez overheard him talking on a cellular\n\nphone, relaying        the    group's      location      to    another   party.      The\n\ngovernment later entered into evidence the call logs from prepaid\n\ncellular phones ostensibly seized from Pacheco, James, and Pérez.\n\nThese logs showed that the cellular phones seized from Pacheco and\n\nJames were constantly communicating with each other on the day of\n\nthe arrests.        The last call between the two was logged at 8:53 p.m.\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\f(roughly the time that the DEA agents observed Del Rosario, James,\n\nand Ramírez entering the terminal).\n\n           The jury also heard testimony from an American Airlines\n\nticket agent attesting to airline reservations that had been made\n\nin the names of each of the five participants in the scheme.      The\n\nagent related that the tickets assigned to Pacheco, Del Rosario,\n\nJames, and Ramírez on the July 29 San Juan to New York flight were\n\nbought at a single New York travel agency and were numbered\n\nsequentially.   This tended to confirm Ramírez's testimony that\n\nPacheco personally had booked the group's air travel and had\n\nunderwritten its cost.\n\n           After the government completed its case in chief, both\n\ndefendants moved for judgments of acquittal based on the alleged\n\ninsufficiency of the evidence.      See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a).   The\n\ndistrict court denied these motions.     The appellants proceeded to\n\nintroduce evidence in their own defense.    They did not renew their\n\nRule 29 motions once they had rested.       The court's charge, the\n\nverdict, and the imposition of sentences followed, as did these\n\nappeals.\n\nII.   SUFFICIENCY OF THE EVIDENCE\n\n           Under ordinary circumstances, we review the grant or\n\ndenial of motions for judgment of acquittal de novo. United States\n\nv.

Here, however, the\n\ncircumstances are not ordinary.     \"A defendant who elects to adduce\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fevidence in [his] defense after the district court has denied a\n\nRule 29 motion made at the close of the government's case is deemed\n\nto have abandoned the earlier motion and waived any objection to\n\nits denial.\"    United States v.

So it is here:        the appellants' failure to renew their\n\nearlier motions for judgment of acquittal after presenting evidence\n\npretermits    the   usual   de    novo    review.

We\n\nfind no hint of injustice here.\n\n            The conspiracy statute under which the appellants were\n\nconvicted provides that \"[a]ny person who attempts or conspires to\n\ncommit any [federal drug] offense . . . shall be subject to the\n\nsame penalties as those prescribed for the offense.\"                   21 U.S.C. §\n\n846.     To ground a conviction under this statute, the government\n\nmust \"show beyond a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy existed and\n\nthat a defendant agreed to participate in it, intending to commit\n\nthe underlying substantive offense.\"              United States v.

In this case, the testimony of\n\nRamírez points directly to the existence of an express agreement\n\namong a band of coconspirators that included both appellants.              He\n\nmet face to face with Del Rosario and Pacheco, directly implicated\n\nthem    in   the    drug-trafficking       scheme,      and   detailed   their\n\nparticipation (citing book and verse).            Ramírez's testimony alone\n\nis adequate to sustain the conspiracy convictions.                 See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Martínez-Medina, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776396\"><a href=\"/opinion/776396/united-states-v-marcos-martinez-medina-united-states-of-america-v-manuel/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 115 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(explaining that uncorroborated testimony of a government informant\n\nis sufficient for conviction if the testimony \"is not incredible or\n\ninsubstantial on its face\") (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see also Ortiz de Jesus, 230 F.3d at 6.\n\n             In an endeavor to parry this thrust, Pacheco charges that\n\nRamírez's testimony was unworthy of credence and compromised by\n\ninconsistencies.      This charge overlooks that judgments as to a\n\nwitness's veracity (or lack of veracity) ordinarily are for the\n\njury, not for an appellate court.

The first of them (count 2) charged that\n\nDel Rosario, at that time and place, knowingly possessed five or\n\nmore kilograms of cocaine with intent to distribute.                         The second\n\n(count 3) charged that, at the same time and place, he knowingly\n\npossessed      one     or    more    kilograms     of    heroin       with   intent     to\n\ndistribute.\n\n               Del Rosario initially argues that the government never\n\nproved that he possessed either the cocaine or the heroin.

He was seen straddling this suitcase with his legs\n\nas he awaited a boarding call for his New York flight.              These facts\n\nare   capable    of   supporting    an   inference    of   either    actual   or\n\nconstructive possession.\n\n           Del    Rosario's   claim      that   the   government     failed   to\n\nestablish his intent to distribute cocaine and heroin is equally\n\nunavailing.      On this record, the illation that he knew this\n\nsuitcase   was    packed   with    narcotics    was   an   easy   (and   wholly\n\nreasonable) one for jurors to draw.             Del Rosario's claim to the\n\ncontrary ignores, among other things, the axiomatic principle that\n\n\"an intent to distribute drugs can legitimately be inferred from\n\nfactors such as quantity and purity.\"           Id.\n\n           To illustrate, the DEA agents found twenty-one packages\n\nin Del Rosario's suitcase.         One distinctively wrapped parcel was\n\ntested separately and found to contain between 665 and 690 grams of\n\nheroin (the record does not contain any information as to its\n\npurity). When the DEA tested the twenty remaining packages, one of\n\nthem was shown to contain 787 grams of heroin, 71% pure.              The other\n\nnineteen parcels contained, in the ensemble, 19.89 kilograms of\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fcocaine, 79% pure.1      The large quantity of contraband found in Del\n\nRosario's possession warrants the inferences that he knew the drugs\n\nwould be released into the stream of commerce and that he intended\n\nto facilitate that action.

The evidence\n\npresented   at   trial   was    more    than   sufficient   to   sustain   the\n\nappellants' convictions.\n\nIII. EVIDENTIARY RULINGS\n\n            The appellants variously assign error to two evidentiary\n\nrulings.    We discuss them separately.\n\n                         A.    The Cellular Phone.\n\n            Pacheco complains that the government never proved that\n\nhe was in possession of the cellular phone used to converse with\n\nJames on July 29.    His plaint focuses on the lack of foundation for\n\nreferences to the phone that were made at trial by Brian Geraghty,\n\na DEA agent.     We set the stage.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Ramírez's and James's suitcases contained, respectively, 18.9\nand 19.88 kilograms of 80% pure cocaine.\n\n                                       -13-\n\f             The record reflects that a cellular phone was taken from\n\nPacheco in New York.        Geraghty, however, was in San Juan at the\n\ntime.     He later participated in the receipt and processing of a\n\ncellular phone at the DEA's San Juan office.           He was told that the\n\nphone was Pacheco's and he inventoried it as such.              However, he had\n\nno personal knowledge of that fact.           The agent who seized the phone\n\ndid not testify, and there was no first-hand evidence as to how the\n\nphone traversed the miles from New York to San Juan.\n\n             During   Geraghty's      trial   testimony,   he    alluded   to   a\n\n\"telephone that was taken from Mr. Pacheco.\"                    This reference\n\noccurred despite the absence of any foundational evidence, to that\n\npoint, that a phone had been seized when Pacheco was detained.                The\n\nallusion     inspired   a   vaguely    phrased    objection,     to   which   the\n\ndistrict court responded that Pacheco's counsel \"need[ed] to bring\n\nthat up outside of the hearing of the jury.\"               Pacheco's counsel\n\nnever followed through on this suggestion.\n\n             Geraghty essayed several other references to the cellular\n\nphone. On one of these occasions, Pacheco's counsel began to state\n\nan objection.      The district court cut her off in mid-sentence.2\n\n\n     2\n         The colloquy between the lawyer and the judge was as follows:\n\n     MS. APONTE:     The objection was that the witness\n     [Geraghty] was with Mr. Pacheco when the telephone was\n     occupied. So if he is testifying as to something he was\n     outside of the presence —\n\n     THE COURT: Overruled. The jury heard the circumstance\n     in which the telephone was seized. They heard it today,\n\n                                       -14-\n\fPacheco now asks us to review the admissibility of the agent's\n\nstatement that the phone was seized from his person.\n\n          There is a serious question as to the applicable standard\n\nof review.   Two difficulties are apparent.      First, the court\n\ninvited defense counsel to take the matter up outside the jury's\n\nearshot, and the record does not reflect that counsel ever did so.3\n\nCf. Cottrill v. Sparrow, Johnson & Ursillo, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197093\"><a href=\"/opinion/197093/cottrill-v-sparrow/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 224\n\nn.2 (1st Cir. 1996) (stating that an appellant who declines the\n\ncourt's invitation to seek modification of an order waives the\n\nissue for purposes of appeal).      This likely was a waiver.   The\n\n\n     as a matter of fact —\n\n     MS. APONTE:   Your Honor.\n\n     THE COURT: — so the jury can deal with that. You can\n     argue your case at an appropriate time in front of the\n     jury.   This is not closing argument.     We are just\n     receiving evidence.\n\nIn his brief, Pacheco indicates that the phrase \"the witness was\nwith Mr. Pacheco\" should read \"the witness was not with Mr.\nPacheco\" (emphasis supplied). It is unclear whether the absence of\nthe word \"not\" was caused by misspeaking or by mistranscription.\nIn all events, Pacheco is bound by the transcript as it stands, as\nhe never requested the district court to correct the phrasing. See\nFed. R. App. P. 10(e)(1) (explaining that disputes arising over the\naccuracy of the trial record ordinarily must be submitted to and\nsettled by the district court).\n     3\n      In his briefing, Pacheco claims that the trial judge\nspontaneously withdrew the invitation and overruled the objection\nbefore a sidebar conference could take place. The record, however,\nis silent in this regard — and it is a party's affirmative\nresponsibility to \"furnish the court of appeals with so much of the\nrecord of the proceedings below as is necessary to enable informed\nappellate review.\"   Faigin v.

Should either of\n\nthese obstacles prove insuperable, review would be limited to plain\n\nerror.\n\n          Here, however, there are some mitigating factors.   Chief\n\namong them is the trial judge's interruption of the lawyer as she\n\nwas apparently attempting to state the grounds for her objection.\n\nThat might suffice to excuse the procedural default.    Cf. United\n\nStates v. Toribio-Lugo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786983\"><a href=\"/opinion/786983/united-states-v-jose-toribio-lugo/\"><span class=\"volume\">376</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"A lawyer\n\nought not to be required to persist stubbornly when the judge has\n\nmade it perfectly clear that he does not wish to hear what the\n\nlawyer has to say.\").\n\n          In the final analysis, we need not probe too deeply into\n\nwhether Pacheco preserved the point. Here, all roads lead to Rome:\n\nwhatever the standard of review, the error was harmless.\n\n          The error itself is manifest.   Geraghty's only knowledge\n\nof the phone's provenance was second-hand. The agent who seized it\n\n\n                               -16-\n\fdid not testify, and the government never established a chain of\n\ncustody tracing the phone from Pacheco's carryall to Geraghty's\n\nhands.   See United States v. Ladd, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529712\"><a href=\"/opinion/529712/united-states-v-gary-ladd/\"><span class=\"volume\">885</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">954</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 956-57 (1st Cir.\n\n1989) (describing chain of custody requirements).                    We conclude,\n\ntherefore,    that    there    was   no   sound       basis   for   admitting   the\n\nreferences linking Pacheco to the cellular phone.\n\n            Notwithstanding the fact that the government used the\n\nphone and the call logs emanating from it to show communication\n\nbetween Pacheco and James on the day of the arrest, this error was\n\nharmless.     \"Where, as here, an error is not of constitutional\n\nmagnitude, reversal is not obligatory unless the bevue 'affect[s]\n\nsubstantial rights.'\" Id. at 957 (quoting Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(a)).\n\nIn determining whether an error affects substantial rights, we ask\n\nwhether we can say, \"with fair assurance, after pondering all that\n\nhappened without stripping the erroneous action from the whole,\n\nthat the judgment was not substantially swayed by the error.\"\n\nKotteakos    v.    United    States,   </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104321\"><a href=\"/opinion/104321/kotteakos-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">328</span>     <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>    <span class=\"page\">750</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,   765   (1946).     The\n\nKotteakos \"fair assurance\" standard requires a substantial degree\n\nof probability, but it does not require that the error be shown to\n\nbe harmless beyond any reasonable doubt.                 See Ladd, 885 F.2d at\n\n957.\n\n             In applying the Kotteakos test, a reviewing court must\n\nengage in \"a panoramic, case-specific inquiry considering, among\n\nother    things,     the    centrality    of    the     tainted     material,   its\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\funiqueness, its prejudicial impact, the uses to which it was put\n\nduring the trial, the relative strengths of the parties' cases, and\n\nany telltales that furnish clues to the likelihood that the error\n\naffected   the   factfinder's       resolution   of    a     material   issue.\"\n\nSepulveda, 15 F.3d at 1182.        The error of which Pacheco complains\n\nis analogous to the one that we found harmless in Ladd.\n\n           First, the point that the government sought to prove by\n\nintroducing   the   cell   phone     evidence    —    that    Pacheco   was    in\n\ncommunication    with   the   men    carrying    the    drugs    —   had   been\n\nestablished by other evidence before Geraghty took the stand.                 And\n\nthere was more.     The jury heard from Ramírez that Pacheco had\n\nfacilitated the group's air travel to and from Puerto Rico and had\n\nexplained the financial terms of the drug deal to the recruits.\n\nThen, too, the supervisor of the DEA surveillance team testified\n\nthat Pacheco was in the terminal at the time of the incident,\n\nacting in a manner that suggested countersurveillance.               Last — but\n\nfar from least — the consecutively numbered airline tickets paid\n\nfor by Pacheco and issued in his and his cohorts' names were a\n\npowerful indicium of his pivotal role in the plot.                Because the\n\nproof of Pacheco's culpability was abundant and the probative value\n\nof the cell phone testimony, in itself, was modest, we think it\n\nhighly unlikely that the exclusion of that testimony would have\n\ninfluenced the jury's verdict.          See United States v. Piper, 298\n\n\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fF.3d 47, 58 (1st Cir. 2002) (explaining that evidence deemed\n\n\"cumulative\" is generally thought to be harmless).\n\n            The second point of similarity with the Ladd analysis is\n\nthe effect of the challenged testimony on the defendant's trial\n\nstrategy.    See Ladd, 885 F.2d at 958.        Pacheco's defense at trial\n\nconsisted of an alibi:       the testimony of two nieces who claimed\n\nthat he had remained in Puerto Rico between July 23 and July 29.\n\nThat testimony, if believed, would have contradicted Ramírez's\n\ntestimony that Pacheco repaired to New York during that interval,\n\nmade the necessary arrangements for the pickup, and returned to\n\nPuerto Rico on July 28 with his \"mules.\"                 The impermissible\n\nreferences to the use of the cell phone in Puerto Rico on July 29,\n\nhowever, are not in any way inconsistent with Pacheco's alibi\n\ndefense and therefore could have no bearing on it.             This lack of\n\ncentrality supports a finding of harmlessness.\n\n            For   these   reasons,    we    conclude   that,   whatever   the\n\nstandard of review, the lower court's admission of the cell phone\n\ntestimony constituted harmless error.\n\n                    B.    The Search of the Suitcase.\n\n            In an attempt to remove the most incriminating piece of\n\nevidence from the mix, Del Rosario challenges the district court's\n\ndenial of his motion to suppress the contents of the suitcase.4\n\n\n     4\n      The district judge originally sent the motion to suppress to\na magistrate judge. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(B). The magistrate\njudge held an evidentiary hearing and recommended denial of the\n\n                                     -19-\n\fDel Rosario trains his fire on the district court's determination\n\nthat the DEA agents secured Del Rosario's valid consent to conduct\n\nthe search.   As framed, this argument calls into question the\n\ncourt's subsidiary findings of fact.   We review these findings for\n\nclear error, see United States v. Zapata, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195255\"><a href=\"/opinion/195255/united-states-v-zapata/\"><span class=\"volume\">18</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">971</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 975 (1st\n\nCir. 1994), while affording plenary review to the district court's\n\nultimate constitutional conclusion that Del Rosario's rights were\n\nnot violated, see United States v.

They offered differing\n\naccounts of the events that took place inside the DEA's airport\n\noffice. Laboy testified that Del Rosario admitted ownership of the\n\nsuitcase and freely consented to a search of it.5      Del Rosario\n\n\nmotion.    Del Rosario then filed a timely objection to the\nmagistrate judge's report.     The district judge overruled this\nobjection and adopted the magistrate's reasoning. For simplicity's\nsake, we do not distinguish between the two judicial officers, but,\nrather, take an institutional view and refer to the determinations\nbelow as those of the district court. See, e.g., United States v.\nMaldonado, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200818\"><a href=\"/opinion/200818/united-states-v-maldonado/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 134 n.1 (1st Cir. 2004).\n     5\n      Although his brief is unclear on the point, Del Rosario\nappears to be making a poorly developed argument that Laboy's\ntestimony included hearsay and, thus, should not have been\nconsidered. That argument is hopeless. For one thing, Del Rosario\nmade no contemporaneous objection to the testimony. See United\nStates v.

He suggests that any consent he might have given was\n\ntainted by coercion.     That is whistling past the graveyard.      A nisi\n\nprius court's determination that consent was voluntary is a factual\n\nfinding, not a legal one, and thus is reviewed only for clear\n\nerror.      Laine, 270 F.3d at 75.        \"The only real question for\n\n\n\nCir. 1996).\n     6\n      We reject Del Rosario's complaint that Laboy's testimony at\nthe suppression hearing contradicts a DEA record indicating that\nAgent Douglas Furlough was the person who requested the consent.\nAt trial, Furlough testified that both he and Laboy had\nparticipated in Del Rosario's initial interview, and that Laboy was\nthe one who had requested consent to open the suitcase. Moreover,\nthe agent who had prepared the original record explained that his\nstatement was based on a faulty assumption.\n\n                                   -21-\n\fappellate    review    is   whether    the   evidence   presented    at   the\n\nsuppression hearing fairly supports this finding.\" Id. The answer\n\nhere is unequivocally in the affirmative.\n\n            To be sure, Del Rosario marshals other \"facts\" in support\n\nof his coercion argument.       But these \"facts\" derive from his own\n\nuncorroborated testimony at the suppression hearing.           The district\n\ncourt declined to credit that testimony, and Laboy's testimony,\n\nunimpeached    on     cross-examination,     suggests   that   Del   Rosario\n\nanswered \"yes\" when asked for a \"simple yes or no\" answer as to\n\nwhether he would consent to an opening of the bag.               Given the\n\ndistrict court's express adoption of Laboy's testimony and its\n\nequally explicit rejection of Del Rosario's account, we discern no\n\nclear error in the determination that the necessary consent was\n\nelicited voluntarily.       See id.\n\n            At the risk of belaboring the obvious, a supportable\n\nfinding of consent eliminates the need for either a search warrant\n\nor probable cause.       See Schneckloth v.

SENTENCING\n\n           Our journey is not yet at an end.     Having received a 235-\n\nmonth prison sentence under the relevant provisions of the United\n\nStates Sentencing Guidelines, Pacheco now invites this court, in a\n\nsupplemental post-argument brief, to set aside his sentence on the\n\nbasis of the Supreme Court's decision in Blakely v. Washington, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2531</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2004).    We decline the invitation.\n\n           Blakely examined the constitutionality of a Washington\n\nstate sentencing scheme.      After the defendant pleaded guilty to\n\nkidnaping, the nisi prius court imposed a sentence above the\n\nstatutory maximum based on a finding of \"deliberate cruelty.\"           Id.\n\nat 2535.   The Supreme Court noted that this finding was \"neither\n\nadmitted by [the defendant] nor found by a jury,\" id. at 2537, and\n\ndeclared   the   augmented   sentence    violative   of   Blakely's   Sixth\n\nAmendment right to trial by jury, id. at 2538.            While the Court\n\nmade clear that the federal sentencing guidelines were not before\n\nit and expressed no opinion on their validity, id. at 2538 n.9, the\n\nrationale of Blakely calls into doubt their constitutionality. The\n\nSupreme Court has taken this precise question under advisement.\n\nSee United States v. Booker, No. 04-104 (argued Oct. 4, 2004);\n\nUnited States v. Fanfan, No. 04-105 (argued Oct. 4, 2004).\n\n           In Pacheco's case, the sentencing court determined, inter\n\nalia, that he was an \"organizer\" of the conspiracy, and hiked his\n\noffense level accordingly.      See USSG §3B1.1(c).       The increase in\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\fthe offense level yielded an elevated guideline sentencing range\n\nand, thus, led to a stiffer sentence.              Invoking Blakely, Pacheco\n\nnow   attempts   for    the     first    time    to   challenge    this   upward\n\nadjustment.      He    posits    that    the    crucial   fact    on   which   the\n\nadjustment depends — his role in the offense of conviction — was\n\nneither determined by the jury nor established beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.7\n\n           The most fundamental flaw in the fabric of this argument\n\nis that Pacheco failed to advance it in the district court.8                   That\n\nflaw is exacerbated because he likewise failed to raise it in his\n\npre-argument appellate briefing.           Such omissions are costly to an\n\nappellant.    See Lattab v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201243\"><a href=\"/opinion/201243/lattab-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 17 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(explaining that an appellant may not raise new points of law for\n\nthe first time in a post-argument brief); United States v. Dietz,\n\n\n      7\n      Pacheco also suggests that the sentencing court's findings of\ndrug quantity, used to calculate his base offense level, see USSG\n§2D1.1(c)(2), are similarly infirm. The drug quantity finding was\nnot challenged below or in Pacheco's opening brief, so we reject\nthat suggestion based on the same reasoning that undergirds our\nrejection of his argument against the role-in-the-offense\nenhancement. See text infra.\n      8\n      The fact that Blakely had not been decided at that time does\nnot excuse this default. The Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi\nv. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 490 (2000), foreshadowed the argument;\nand, in all events, the prospect of an adverse ruling does not\nrelieve a party of the duty of lodging a contemporaneous objection.\nSee, e.g., Derman v.

See\n\nUnited     States   v.

We need not make so fine a\n\ndistinction today.        Assuming arguendo, favorably to Pacheco, that\n\nthe plain error standard applies, he is nonetheless ineligible for\n\nrelief.9\n\n             The substantive standards for plain error review are\n\ndifficult to satisfy.           We will only reverse the trial court's\n\ndecision if a defendant demonstrates \"(1) that an error occurred\n\n(2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected\n\n[his] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the\n\nfairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"\n\n\n\n\n     9\n      In his supplemental brief, Pacheco claims that the putative\nBlakely error was preserved (and, therefore, that the error\nengenders de novo review). The record belies that claim: at no\npoint during the sentencing proceedings did Pacheco object to the\nrole-in-the-offense enhancement or to the determination of drug\nquantity on any ground that anticipates, or even remotely\nresembles, the Blakely rationale.\n\n                                        -25-\n\fUnited States v. Duarte, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).                     We find\n\nno plain error here.        Our conclusion rests on two bases.\n\n            The first involves timing.           The district court sentenced\n\nPacheco on November 26, 2002.             That was almost nineteen months\n\nbefore the Supreme Court decided Blakely.                    Circuit precedent in\n\nforce at the time of Pacheco's sentencing, in line with the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Apprendi v. New Jersey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2000),\n\nprovided that an aggravating sentencing factor did not need to be\n\npresented to a jury or proven beyond a reasonable doubt so long as\n\nthe resulting sentence did not exceed the statutory maximum.                        See\n\nUnited States v. Caba, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199298\"><a href=\"/opinion/199298/united-states-v-caba/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 101 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding\n\nthat,   within    these     parameters,         Apprendi      permits   an     upward\n\nadjustment     for   a     defendant's         role     in    a   drug-trafficking\n\nconspiracy).      Here, the underlying offense carries a maximum\n\nsentence of life in prison.           See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A).           Whether\n\nBlakely has      fatally    undermined     this       line   of   authority    is   an\n\nunsettled    question      at   the    moment    and,    whatever    the     ultimate\n\noutcome, the answer is neither clear nor obvious.                       See United\n\nStates v. Cordoza-Estrada, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2004) [No.\n\n03-2666, slip op. at 9] (per curiam).             Accordingly, we cannot find\n\nthat the district court committed plain error when it sentenced\n\nPacheco on the basis, in part, of an upward role-in-the-offense\n\nadjustment.    See Morgan, 384 F.3d at 8.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\f             The second reason why there is no plain error involves\n\nthe fourth prong of the plain error test:                any bevue in failing to\n\nsubmit the role-in-the-offense issue to the jury did not seriously\n\naffect the fairness of the proceedings.                   See United States v.\n\nCotton, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 631-32 (2002); Johnson v.

We reach this conclusion because the\n\ntranscript of the disposition hearing is utterly devoid of any\n\nattack either on the Probation Department's recommendation that an\n\nupward role-in-the-offense adjustment be imposed or on the district\n\ncourt's    determination      that   Pacheco     was     the    organizer   of   the\n\nenterprise (and, thus, was deserving of such an adjustment).                      To\n\ncinch     matters,     the   facts      of     record,     including      Ramírez's\n\nidentification of Pacheco both as an \"owner\" of the drugs and as\n\nthe de facto tour director for the group's air travel, strongly\n\nsupport the conclusion that Pacheco was a driving force in the\n\nconspiracy.        Under these circumstances, any error (assuming that\n\none occurred) cannot be classified as plain.                See United States v.\n\nSavarese, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2004) [No. 04-1099, slip op.\n\nat 16-17].\n\nV.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.             We conclude that the evidence\n\npresented     at    trial    supports     the    jury's        verdict;   that   the\n\nappellants' claims of reversible error, insofar as they relate to\n\nthe district court's evidentiary rulings, lack force; and that the\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\funpreserved claim of Blakely error does not afford Pacheco a\n\ncognizable   basis   for   relief.      Consequently,   we   affirm   the\n\nappellants' convictions and sentences.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\f</pre>",
