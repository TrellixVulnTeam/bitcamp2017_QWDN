This appeal stems from a mass\n\narrest sting designed to capture a large number of persons with\n\noutstanding arrest warrants.      Plaintiff-appellant Niquicia Wilson,\n\nwho had no criminal record and was never subject to an arrest\n\nwarrant, was mistakenly swept up in the arrest.                 As a result of\n\nthis experience, she sued various arresting officers and the City\n\nof Boston under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 and state law.             The district court\n\ngranted summary judgment to the City, but the rest of the case went\n\nto   trial.     Wilson    prevailed   at    trial    against    Captain   Robert\n\nDunford, who planned and commanded the operation and was the\n\narresting      officer.      However,       the     court   granted    judgment\n\nnotwithstanding the verdict for Dunford on the basis of qualified\n\nimmunity.     That ruling is the principal subject of this appeal.\n\n              We hold that the jury was entitled to conclude that\n\nWilson's arrest was an unreasonable seizure prohibited by the\n\nFourth Amendment.     Nevertheless, we find that Dunford was entitled\n\nto qualified immunity because an objectively reasonable officer in\n\nhis position could have believed that his conduct would not violate\n\nthe Fourth Amendment.        We also agree with the district court's\n\nresolution of other issues presented on appeal.                Consequently, we\n\naffirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f                                    I.\n\n          Because the case was tried to a jury, we recite the facts\n\nin the light most favorable to the verdict.             United States v.\n\nCastellini, 392 F.3d 35, 39 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                    A.\n\n          In   the   spring   of   1999,    plaintiff-appellant    Niquicia\n\nWilson, an eighteen-year-old student with no criminal history, and\n\nher boyfriend, Jean Cassamajor, received a letter in the mail. The\n\nletter, addressed to Cassamajor, came from John Goodwin, who\n\nsupposedly represented a company called Madrid International that\n\nwas planning to act as a job broker to hire a large number of\n\npeople for work on Boston's \"Big Dig\" construction project.             The\n\nletter invited Cassamajor to attend a job fair on Sunday, June 27,\n\n1999 at the Bayside Expo Center in Dorchester, Massachusetts.\n\nWilson was excited by the prospect of stable, long-term employment\n\nfor Cassamajor, and encouraged him to attend.\n\n          On the day of the job fair, Wilson drove Cassamajor to\n\nthe Bayside Expo Center, parked the car, and accompanied him into\n\nthe lobby of the exhibition hall.          Cassamajor went to check in at\n\na staffed registration table, and Wilson went to a nearby vending\n\nmachine to buy a soda.\n\n          Suddenly she heard a commotion, and saw that two or more\n\nmen had tackled Cassamajor and thrown him to the floor.           One of the\n\nmen yelled to Cassamajor that he was under arrest, and Wilson\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\finferred       (correctly)          that    the    men   were    plain-clothed        police\n\nofficers.         The   officers pushed Cassamajor through a set of double\n\ndoors into the exhibition hall.\n\n               Wilson        approached      the    officers     and    asked       what   was\n\nhappening. They instructed her to go into the exhibition hall, and\n\n\"nudged\" or encouraged her in the direction of the doors.                                  Not\n\nwanting      to    receive      the    same       treatment     as   Cassamajor,      Wilson\n\ncomplied and entered the hall. There were approximately 105 people\n\nseated in the hall, and a larger number of police officers.                           Wilson\n\nsaw that Cassamajor (now handcuffed) was sitting near the front,\n\nand she sat down behind him.\n\n               Defendant-appellee Captain Robert Dunford of the Boston\n\nPolice Department (\"BPD\") was standing at a podium in the front of\n\nthe room.1         He told the assembled group that they were all under\n\narrest and that everyone should sit calmly.                      Not everyone complied\n\n-- some of those present yelled at the officers -- but Wilson sat\n\ncalmly.       At some point Dunford and other police officers explained\n\nthat       everyone     in    the    room    was    under     arrest   for    outstanding\n\nwarrants, and Wilson realized that the \"job fair\" was in fact a\n\nsting operation.             Someone shouted a question regarding what would\n\nhappen       to    arrestees        who     did    not   actually      have     a    warrant\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      Dunford is currently the Superintendent of the BPD. We refer\nto him as Captain Dunford because that was his position during the\nevents at issue in this case.\n\n                                              -4-\n\foutstanding.   Captain Dunford responded that if the person did not\n\nhave a warrant, the police \"would square that away later.\"\n\n            Wilson informed a nearby officer that she was only at the\n\nhall to drop her boyfriend off, and that if he checked he would see\n\nthat there was no warrant for her arrest.    The officer told her to\n\nsit down.    Another arrestee had also told officers that he was in\n\nthe hall by mistake, and a Detective Arnstein summoned Captain\n\nDunford to talk to that person and Wilson.    After Wilson explained\n\nher situation to Dunford, he replied \"fine, we are just going to\n\ncheck you to make sure that the story you are telling us is the\n\ntruth and if that is determined, you are free to leave.\"\n\n            At police instructions, Wilson remained seated for \"a\n\nvery long time.\"2   She did not speak up at this point because, she\n\nlater explained, \"I didn't want to get roughed up.       Some people\n\nwere being roughed up.    I didn't want that to happen to me.\"\n\n            The police took arrestees in groups to a table at the\n\nback of the hall for processing. When Wilson's section was finally\n\n\n\n     2\n      Wilson's characterizations of the intervals of time at issue\nare very approximate. At various times her testimony provides a\nrange of time (e.g., \"[a]bout ten, 15 minutes\"); in such instances\nwe state the higher end of the range. For the first eight minutes\nafter Captain Dunford announced that everyone in the room was under\narrest, a videotape of the sting provides some time references, but\nmuch of Wilson's testimony cannot be precisely matched to events\nshown on the videotape. Because we recite the facts in the light\nmost favorable to the jury's verdict for Wilson, see Castellini,\n392 F.3d at 39, we generally rely on her depiction of the events\nthat she witnessed, eschewing specificity where the record viewed\nin this light does not provide it.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fcalled -- it was the last section -- she was handcuffed and moved\n\ntowards the processing table.          All along the way, she repeatedly\n\ninsisted that she had no warrants.\n\n            At the processing table, Detective Janine Mitchell (a\n\ndefendant   below,   but    not    before    us   on    appeal)   was   matching\n\narrestees to folders compiled in advance.                Upon realizing that\n\nthere was no folder for Wilson, Mitchell inquired if she had any\n\naliases, such as \"Nicky,\" \"Tonya,\" or \"Nicole.\" Wilson stated that\n\nshe did not. Eventually, after about fifteen minutes, Mitchell led\n\nWilson outside the building to stand near a van with a computerized\n\nwarrant checking system.          Wilson asked to be taken inside due to\n\nthe heat, but Mitchell said words to the effect of, \"We know you're\n\nlying and until you tell us the truth, you'll sit out here.\"\n\n            The   officer     inside        the   van     asked    Wilson    for\n\nidentification, and she produced a valid Massachusetts driver's\n\nlicense.    The officer continued to check for outstanding warrants\n\nunder names such as \"Nicky Wilson\" or \"Tonya Wilson.\"              After about\n\nhalf an hour, having concluded that there was in fact no warrant\n\nfor Wilson's arrest, the officers sent for Captain Dunford.\n\n            When Dunford arrived, he asked Wilson for identification,\n\nand she again produced her driver's license.               Finally, realizing\n\nthe error, he explained that she would be released as soon as the\n\npolice could fill out an \"incident report.\"              In the meantime, she\n\nwas moved back into the auditorium.           It took the officers another\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\ften minutes to write the incident report, which was noted as\n\ncompleted at 11:30 AM and which stated in relevant part: \"Suspect\n\nabove was placed under arrest as a result of Operation Madrid . . .\n\n. Subsequent warrant check revealed suspect to have no outstanding\n\nwarrants.\"3      It took another twenty minutes to await a \"cuff\n\ncutter\" who could cut off her plastic handcuffs.\n\n             After her handcuffs were cut, Wilson was free to leave.\n\nThe entire incident had taken a little under two hours.      She went\n\nto the parking lot and found her boyfriend Cassamajor, who, it\n\nturned out, did not have an outstanding warrant either.4\n\n                                   B.\n\n             The \"job fair\" had been about three months in the making.\n\nThe BPD had a longstanding problem with outstanding arrest warrants\n\n(due in part to erroneous names, addresses, and so forth), and by\n\nearly 1999 there were some 14,000 warrants outstanding.       Captain\n\nDunford conceived a plan, code named     \"Operation Goodwin,\" to help\n\nsolve the problem by luring suspects to a fictitious job fair and\n\nthen arresting them en masse.\n\n             The BPD mailed a letter with a job application to the\n\ntargets of the 14,000 outstanding warrants.      About 6,500 of those\n\nletters were returned for having bad addresses.       In other cases,\n\n\n\n     3\n      Wilson asked for a copy of the incident report, but the\nofficers refused. She eventually obtained it through counsel.\n     4\n         The record does not indicate whether Cassamajor filed suit.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthe BPD learned that the suspect had died or left the jurisdiction.\n\n           The BPD took other measures to whittle the list. In some\n\ncases, the suspect was arrested on another matter and therefore no\n\nlonger needed to be part of Operation Goodwin.   In other cases, the\n\nBPD determined that the warrant had been cleared in court (e.g., a\n\nfine had been paid) and the department's computerized warrant\n\nsystem was simply not up to date.     After all the fine-tuning, the\n\nlist was narrowed to some 300 persons.    The BPD sent them a second\n\nletter with an invitation to a June 27, 1999 job fair at the\n\nBayside Expo Center and requested an RSVP.       Of those 300, 192\n\nresponded.   One of the 192 was Wilson's boyfriend Cassamajor, who\n\nhad once been the subject of an arrest warrant which, apparently\n\nunbeknownst to the BPD, had already been cleared.\n\n           The plan for the event called for civilian BPD employees\n\nto staff registration tables at the hall entrance. These employees\n\nwould verify that each arriving person was on the list of the 200\n\npersons who had indicated that they planned to attend the event.\n\nCaptain Dunford anticipated that some of the recipients might bring\n\nfamily members or friends, or that random passers-by might wander\n\nin.   If an uninvited person presented himself at the registration\n\ntable, he would be told that the event was invitation-only and a\n\nsimilar event would be held in a few weeks.   The registration table\n\nwas the only point at which entrants were checked to ensure that\n\nthey were actually invited.\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f              Once     a   \"job     fair\"     attendee      was     verified      at    the\n\nregistration         table,    he    would    be     directed      to     alphabetically\n\norganized      seats.          Plainclothed        police    \"spotters\"         would   be\n\ninterspersed among the attendees in case anyone had a weapon.                           At\n\n10:00 AM, Captain Dunford would ascend the podium and announce that\n\neveryone was under arrest.             Police arrest teams would then enter\n\nand secure the room.                Arrestees would be taken by rows to a\n\nprocessing table at the rear of the hall, where officers would have\n\nalphabetically         organized      folders       containing          each   arrestee's\n\nphotograph, outstanding warrants, and a pre-filled arrest report.\n\n              According       to    Dunford,       the   plan     provided      that    the\n\nprocessing table would be the point at which the BPD would deal\n\nwith arrestees who claimed that they did not have a warrant.5                           The\n\nplan was that \"[s]ince [the BPD] had folders on every person who\n\nwas supposed to be there with their photo . . . if anyone did get\n\ninto the hall by mistake, we could clarify it right there.\"                             For\n\nexample, if an arrestee presented documentation stating that the\n\nwarrant had been cleared (e.g., a receipt from the court stating\n\nthat a fine had been paid), he would be released.                         Alternatively,\n\nif it turned out that an arrestee simply had the misfortune of\n\nsharing   a    name     with    someone      who    actually      had    an    outstanding\n\nwarrant, the officers at the processing table would realize that\n\n\n     5\n      This was apparently the meaning of his remark that if a\narrestee had no warrant, the police \"would square that away later.\"\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\fthe photograph did not match, and would \"be able to immediately\n\nlook at the photo and say these are two different people and\n\nrelease that person immediately.\"\n\n           On the morning of the event, two hours before it was to\n\nbegin, the BPD rechecked all 200 names on the list to ensure that\n\nno one had been arrested, or had his warrant cleared, since the\n\ninvitations had been mailed.        To maintain the element of surprise,\n\nthe approximately 100 line officers involved were not informed of\n\nthe operation until just beforehand.6\n\n           At the convention center, approximately 105 of the 200\n\nresponding invitees appeared and registered.          Captain Dunford made\n\nthe planned arrest announcement a few minutes after 10:00 AM.              He\n\nwas   shortly   thereafter   told    that   there   were   two   people   (not\n\nincluding Wilson) who were in the hall by mistake.           Dunford called\n\nthem out by name, apologized, and personally escorted them to the\n\nfront reception area.        Civilian employees then verified their\n\nidentification and released them.\n\n           Of the 105 attendees, the vast majority indeed had valid\n\noutstanding warrants.    Operation Goodwin was essentially complete\n\n\n\n\n      6\n      The record contains information, ultimately not presented at\ntrial, suggesting that the briefing was incomplete in comparison to\nCaptain Dunford's plan.      For example, the officers at the\nprocessing table were not instructed on what to do in case an\narrestee claimed she was present by mistake.\n\n                                     -10-\n\fby noon, several hours ahead of schedule.          That afternoon, the BPD\n\nheld a press conference to announce the operation, at which Captain\n\nDunford spoke and described the sting as a success.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            Wilson filed suit in Massachusetts Superior Court against\n\nCaptain Dunford, Officer Mitchell, three unknown police officers\n\n(\"the police defendants\"), the City of Boston, and the Commissioner\n\nof the BPD (\"the municipal defendants\").              Against the police\n\ndefendants, she pled false imprisonment (Count I), intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress (Count II), and violations of\n\nvarious constitutional rights (principally, the right to be free\n\nfrom unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment) under 42\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1983 and the parallel Massachusetts Civil Rights Act,\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, ยง 11H (Count III).          Against the municipal\n\ndefendants, she pled negligent supervision (Count IV) and a policy\n\nor custom of failing to reasonably train and supervise police\n\nofficers (Count V).      The defendants removed the suit to federal\n\ncourt.\n\n            The district court ruled from the bench on cross-motions\n\nfor summary judgment.      It granted the City's motion for summary\n\njudgment on the grounds that Wilson had failed to establish either\n\nthat the City had negligently supervised its officers, or that\n\nCaptain Dunford -- who had conceived and led Operation Goodwin --\n\nwas   an   official   policymaker   within   the   meaning   of   Monell   v.\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fDepartment of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658, 694 (1978). The court\n\ndenied the motions of Dunford and Mitchell -- who had argued both\n\nthat Wilson's rights were not violated and that they were entitled\n\nto qualified immunity -- on the grounds that \"there are factual\n\nissues that need to be presented at trial that preclude[] summary\n\njudgment in either direction.\"       For the same reason, it denied\n\nWilson's motion for summary judgment.\n\n            The claims against Dunford and Mitchell proceeded to a\n\njury trial.    At the close of all the evidence, the district court\n\ngranted the police defendants' motions for judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw on the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress\n\n(Count II).    Thus, only three claims remained: false imprisonment\n\n(Count I), violation of civil rights under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 (Count\n\nIII), and   violation of civil rights under the Massachusetts Civil\n\nRights Act (also pled as part of Count III).        Over both parties'\n\nobjections, the district court submitted the question of qualified\n\nimmunity to the jury on a special verdict form.\n\n            The jury returned a verdict for Mitchell on both counts.\n\nAs to Dunford, the jury found no false imprisonment or violation of\n\nthe Massachusetts Civil Rights Act.      However, it found that he had\n\nviolated    Wilson's   Fourth   Amendment   right   to   be   free   from\n\nunreasonable seizure, and that he was not entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity under ยง 1983.    It awarded nominal damages of one dollar.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f          Both parties moved for judgment as a matter of law under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 50.    The district court granted Dunford's motion,\n\nconcluding both that Wilson's detention did not violate the Fourth\n\nAmendment and that Dunford was entitled to qualified immunity as a\n\nmatter of law.     The court also acknowledged that it had erred in\n\ninitially submitting the qualified immunity question to the jury.\n\nIt thus entered judgment as a matter of law for Dunford.       This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n                                III.\n\n          On appeal, Wilson assigns, by our count, six distinct\n\nerrors below.7     Three have been procedurally forfeited and we\n\ndispose of them summarily.8    The claims that remain are that (1)\n\n\n     7\n      We construe her assignments of error generously and ignore\ncertain defects in her argument. For example, much of her argument\nconcerning the Fourth Amendment issue lies in a section devoted to\nchallenging the district court's refusal to grant summary judgment\nin her favor. Strictly speaking, we have no jurisdiction over such\na claim because denial of summary judgment is not appealable under\n28 U.S.C. ยง 1291. See Nieves-Luciano v. Hernandez-Torres, 397 F.3d\n1, 4 (1st Cir. 2005). However, since she properly preserved these\nissues by moving for judgment as a matter of law at the close of\nall the evidence and then again after the jury verdict, and since\nthere is no prejudice to defendants, we treat this argumentation as\nif it were aimed at the district court's denial of her motion for\njudgment as a matter of law, which we have jurisdiction to review.\n     8\n      First, Wilson argues that the court failed to give a jury\ninstruction that false arrest constitutes \"coercion\" under the\nMassachusetts Civil Rights Act.     This claim was not preserved\nbecause her request for this instruction below was inadequate and\nuntimely, and she did not timely object to the instruction as\ngiven. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 51(c); Gray v. Genlyte Group, Inc., 289\nF.3d 128, 133-34 (1st Cir. 2002).     Consequently, we review for\nplain error.    Id. at 134.    Even if the failure to give this\ninstruction was an error that is plain and would likely affect the\n\n                                -13-\n\fthe evidence established a Fourth Amendment violation, (2) Dunford\n\nis not entitled to qualified immunity, and (3) the City is liable\n\nunder Monell because Dunford was a policymaker.\n\n           We begin with some observations about our standard of\n\nreview.   The posture of this case is somewhat unusual.        Typically,\n\na ยง 1983 defendant raises the qualified immunity issue either in a\n\nmotion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) or a motion for\n\nsummary judgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.        See Cox v. Hainey, 391\n\nF.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 2004) (noting that \"applicability vel non of\n\nthe   qualified   immunity   doctrine    should   be   determined   at   the\n\nearliest practicable stage in the case\"); see also Mitchell v.\n\nForsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 526 (1985) (value of defense \"is effectively\n\nlost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial\").           If the\n\ndistrict court grants one of these dispositive motions, then the\n\nplaintiff appeals.      If the court denies the motion on legal\n\ngrounds, the defendant usually takes an interlocutory appeal.            See\n\n\noutcome, it would not be \"sufficiently fundamental to threaten the\nfairness or integrity or public reputation of the judicial\nproceeding.\" Id. (internal quotation marks omitted).\n     Second, she argues that the jury returned an inconsistent\nverdict because it found a violation of ยง 1983 but not of the\nMassachusetts Civil Rights Act. She forfeited this argument by\nfailing to object before the jury was discharged, Howard v.\nAntilla, 294 F.3d 244, 250 (1st Cir. 2002), and once again it does\nnot qualify as plain error.\n     Third, she argues that the court erred by denying her motion\nfor judgment as a matter of law on the false imprisonment claim.\nThe point is inadequately developed, even when we combine it with\nher argument for reversal of the district court's denial of summary\njudgment, see supra note 7, and we deem it waived.      See United\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                  -14-\n\fRiverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare, 392 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\nsee also Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 200 (2001) (explaining that\n\nthe purpose of qualified immunity is not just to protect the\n\ndefendant from liability, but also from \"stand[ing] trial or\n\nfac[ing]     the   other   burdens   of    litigation\")    (quotation      marks\n\nomitted).9    In either case, the same analytic framework applies:\n\n             This Court has identified a three-step process\n             for evaluating qualified immunity claims: (1)\n             whether   the   claimant   has   alleged   the\n             deprivation of an actual constitutional right;\n             (2) whether the right was clearly established\n             at the time of the alleged action or inaction;\n             and (3) if both of these questions are\n             answered in the affirmative, whether an\n             objectively reasonable official would have\n             believed that the action taken violated that\n             clearly established constitutional right.\n\nStarlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto, 253 F.3d 137, 141 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n             In Saucier, the Supreme Court explained that the pure\n\nconstitutional question (i.e., the first prong) \"must be the\n\ninitial inquiry,\" and courts may not simply \"skip ahead to the\n\nquestion whether the law clearly established that the officer's\n\nconduct was unlawful in the circumstances of the case.\"              533 U.S.\n\nat   201.      Saucier     explained      that   courts   must   address     the\n\nconstitutional merits question first in order to facilitate the\n\ndevelopment of the law:\n\n\n\n     9\n      Here, the defendants probably could not have taken an\ninterlocutory appeal because summary judgment was denied based on\nfactual disputes, not legal questions. See Rodrรญguez-Rodrรญguez v.\nOrtiz-Vรฉlez, 391 F.3d 36, 39-40 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                       -15-\n\f             In the course of determining whether a\n             constitutional right was violated on the\n             premises alleged, a court might find it\n             necessary to set forth principles which will\n             become the basis for a holding that a right is\n             clearly established. This is the process for\n             the law's elaboration from case to case, and\n             it is one reason for our insisting upon\n             turning to the existence or nonexistence of a\n             constitutional right as the first inquiry.\n\nId.\n\n             Here, the district court rejected the police defendants'\n\nmotions for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity,\n\nand the entire case -- including not only whether Wilson suffered\n\na   Fourth    Amendment   violation,   but   also   whether   the   police\n\ndefendants enjoyed qualified immunity for any such violation -- was\n\ntried to the jury.     After the jury returned a verdict and Dunford\n\nmoved for judgment as a matter of law, the district court later\n\nrecognized that the qualified immunity issue was a question of law\n\nfor the court to decide, notwithstanding any disputed material\n\nfacts.   See Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office, 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st\n\nCir. 2002); St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia, 71 F.3d 20, 24 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (\"The ultimate question of qualified immunity should\n\n\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fordinarily be decided by the court.\"); id. at 24 n.1.10             The court\n\nconcluded that Dunford was entitled to qualified immunity.\n\n               This atypical history means that we are in the somewhat\n\nunusual position of considering the qualified immunity question for\n\nthe first time when the case has already been tried.             To be sure,\n\nthis unusual posture does not affect the viability of the qualified\n\nimmunity defense.        See Lampkins v. Thompson, 337 F.3d 1009, 1014\n\n(8th    Cir.    2003)   (describing   such   a   posture   as   \"procedurally\n\nunusual,\" but emphasizing that \"the qualified immunity defense is\n\nnot waived or lost if a case proceeds to trial\"); Johnson v.\n\nBreeden, 280 F.3d 1308, 1317 (11th Cir. 2002) (\"Defendants who are\n\nnot successful with their qualified immunity defense before trial\n\ncan re-assert it at the end of the plaintiff's case in a Rule 50(a)\n\nmotion.\").        And, ultimately, \"the procedural posture in which\n\n[Wilson's] appeal arises [does not] greatly influence the standard\n\nof review.\"      Iacobucci v. Boulter, 193 F.3d 14, 23 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nTypically, we review a dismissal or grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo and construe the allegations or evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the non-movant.           See id. at 22.       In the present\n\ncircumstance, \"[w]hen a qualified immunity defense is pressed after\n\n\n       10\n      Genuine disputes concerning material facts must be resolved\nby the jury, Suboh, 298 F.3d at 90, perhaps by special verdict\nform, see, e.g., Singh v. Blue Cross/Blue Shield of Mass., Inc.,\n308 F.3d 25, 35 n.9 (1st Cir. 2002).        However, whether the\nofficer's conduct was objectively reasonable under a given set of\nfacts is a question of law for the court. See Suboh, 298 F.3d at\n90; St. Hilaire, 71 F.3d at 24 & n.1.\n\n                                      -17-\n\fa jury verdict, the evidence must be construed in the light most\n\nhospitable to the party that prevailed at trial.\"        Id. at 23.\n\nSince Wilson was both the non-movant at the summary judgment stage\n\nand the victor before the jury, it makes little difference that we\n\nreview the qualified immunity question after trial instead of\n\nbefore it.    In either case, we construe the facts in the light most\n\nfavorable to Wilson, and decide legal questions de novo.\n\n             Having completed that detour, we begin with the first\n\nstage of the qualified immunity analysis, and inquire whether the\n\nevidence at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict, is legally sufficient to support the jury's verdict that\n\nthe plaintiff was deprived of a constitutional right.\n\nA.           The First Prong\n\n             The Fourth Amendment provides that \"[t]he right of the\n\npeople to be secure in their persons . . . against unreasonable\n\nsearches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall\n\nissue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation,\n\nand particularly describing . . . the persons or things to be\n\nseized.\"     While the text of the amendment only mentions probable\n\ncause in the context of issuing a warrant, decades of case law have\n\nestablished that a warrantless arrest also requires probable cause.\n\nE.g., United States v. Meade, 110 F.3d 190, 193 (1st Cir. 1997).11\n\n\n     11\n      The district court analyzed Wilson's detention as if it were\nnot an arrest, but rather an investigatory stop within the meaning\nof Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1 (1968). Under Terry and its progeny,\n\n                                 -18-\n\f          Most arrests fall into one of several common patterns.\n\nIn the first scenario, an officer without a warrant suspects that\n\na certain person has just committed, or is about to commit, a\n\ncrime.   In that case, \"[p]robable cause for an arrest exists when\n\nthe   arresting    officer,    acting     upon   apparently   trustworthy\n\ninformation, reasonably concludes that a crime has been (or is\n\nabout to be) committed and that the putative arrestee likely is one\n\nof the perpetrators.\"      Acosta v. Ames Dep't Stores, Inc., 386 F.3d\n\n5, 9 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          In a second arrest scenario, \"a law enforcement officer\n\n[purporting   to   have]   information    amounting   to   probable   cause\n\ndirects an officer who lacks the knowledge to make the arrest.\"\n\nMeade, 110 F.3d at 193.         In such cases, \"we 'impute' to the\n\narresting officer the directing officer's knowledge,\" and thus the\n\narrest stands or falls on what the directing officer knew, not what\n\nthe arresting officer knew.      Id.\n\n          In a third scenario, a magistrate has issued a warrant\n\nfor a suspect's arrest.       In that case, we essentially ignore the\n\narresting officer's knowledge; the officer need not know anything\n\nmore than that a facially valid arrest warrant has issued. Rather,\n\n\n\"police officers who suspect criminal activity [can] make limited\nintrusions on an individual's personal security based on less than\nprobable cause.\" Michigan v. Summers, 452 U.S. 692, 698 (1981).\nHowever, both Captain Dunford and Officer Mitchell testified\nunambiguously that Wilson was under arrest. At any rate, appellees\ndo not argue on appeal that Wilson's arrest should be treated as a\nmere Terry stop, and we see no reason to treat it as one.\n\n                                   -19-\n\fwe focus entirely on the magistrate's knowledge to determine if the\n\nmagistrate had \"a substantial basis for determining the existence\n\nof probable cause.\"      Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 239 (1983).\n\n            These paradigms do not adequately capture the situation\n\nhere.     Since there was no warrant for Wilson's arrest, this case\n\ncannot fall in the third category.           But it does not comfortably fit\n\nin the first or second categories either. No officer even purports\n\nto have drawn the conclusion \"that a crime ha[d] been (or [was]\n\nabout to be) committed and that [Wilson] likely [was] one of the\n\nperpetrators,\" Acosta, 386 F.3d at 9.\n\n            It is perhaps natural, and appellees understandably seize\n\nupon the temptation, to misframe the question.               Instead of asking\n\nwhether    there   was   probable   cause     to   believe   that   Wilson     had\n\ncommitted a crime, appellees pose the issue as whether there was\n\nprobable cause to believe that a warrant had been issued for her\n\narrest. That is not the correct analysis; it wrongly conflates the\n\nFourth    Amendment   question   of    probable     cause    with   the   ยง   1983\n\nquestion (under the third prong of the qualified immunity test) of\n\nobjective reasonableness.        As the Saucier framework makes clear,\n\ncourts must first answer the constitutional question as if there\n\nwere no such thing as qualified immunity, and only then ask whether\n\nthe additional protections of qualified immunity are available.\n\nSee 533 U.S. at 201.        We must remember that \"the reasonableness\n\nstandards underlying the probable cause and qualified immunity\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\finquiries are not coterminous.\"       Iacobucci, 193 F.3d at 23.          In\n\nparticular,   qualified    immunity   allows    for   a   wider   range    of\n\nmistakes.   See Cox, 391 F.3d at 31.    Qualified immunity \"eschews a\n\nline that separates the constitutional from the unconstitutional\n\nand instead draws a line that separates unconstitutional but\n\nobjectively reasonable acts from obviously unconstitutional acts.\"\n\nId. at 31.      In determining whether the Fourth Amendment was\n\nviolated, we must rigorously draw precisely the line that qualified\n\nimmunity    eschews   --   between    the      constitutional     and     the\n\nunconstitutional -- and not erroneously import the wider latitude\n\nafforded by ยง 1983 into the Constitution itself.\n\n            Under these basic principles, the Fourth Amendment is not\n\nsatisfied simply because the police had an objectively reasonable\n\nbelief that there was a warrant for Wilson's arrest.            Indeed, the\n\nFourth Amendment would not necessarily be satisfied even if the\n\npolice correctly believed that there was a warrant for her arrest.\n\nThe Fourth Amendment requires that a warrant must be supported by\n\nprobable cause.   See U.S. Const. amend. IV; Gates, 462 U.S. at 239.\n\nAnd the probable cause that must ground a warrant cannot simply be\n\n\"probable cause to believe that there is a warrant.\"\n\n            In short, the ultimate question for determining whether\n\nan arrest violates    the Fourth Amendment is, in this context as in\n\nany other, whether there was probable cause to believe that the\n\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\farrestee had committed or was committing a crime.12     Under this\n\nanalysis, Wilson's arrest violated the Fourth Amendment.        No\n\nofficer ever formed the conclusion \"that a crime ha[d] been (or\n\n[was] about to be) committed and that [Wilson] likely [was] one of\n\nthe perpetrators,\" Acosta, 386 F.3d at 9.   Nor did any magistrate.\n\nRather, this is a case where each officer thought that some other\n\nofficer had convinced a magistrate to issue a warrant for Wilson's\n\narrest.   And an arrest is not valid simply because the arresting\n\nofficer thinks that a second officer has adequate justification to\n\narrest a particular person.   In such cases, the validity of the\n\narrest turns on whether the second officer actually did have\n\nadequate justification to arrest that person:\n\n          Certainly police officers called upon to aid\n          other officers in executing arrest warrants\n          are entitled to assume that the officers\n          requesting aid offered the magistrate the\n          information    requisite    to   support    an\n          independent judicial assessment of probable\n          cause. Where, however, the contrary turns out\n          to be true, an otherwise illegal arrest cannot\n          be insulated from challenge by the decision of\n          the instigating officer to rely on fellow\n          officers to make the arrest.\n\n\n     12\n      Of course, whether a particular remedy is available for the\nFourth Amendment violation may turn on whether the arresting\nofficer reasonably relied on information that, in retrospect, did\nnot constitute probable cause. The good faith exception to the\nexclusionary rule in criminal cases, see United States v. Leon, 468\nU.S. 897, 922-23 (1984), and the qualified immunity defense in\nยง 1983 cases, limit the remedies available when police violate the\nFourth Amendment based on a reasonable, good-faith misunderstanding\nof the law or facts. But before determining whether a remedy is\navailable, we must first determine whether the Fourth Amendment has\neven been violated.\n\n                               -22-\n\fWhiteley v. Warden, 401 U.S. 560, 568 (1971); see also United\n\nStates v. Hensley, 469 U.S. 221, 231 (1985) (the validity of an\n\narrest based on a police bulletin \"turns on whether the officers\n\nwho issued the flyer possessed probable cause to make the arrest.\n\nIt does not turn on whether those relying on the flyer were\n\nthemselves aware of the specific facts which led their colleagues\n\nto seek their assistance\") (emphasis omitted); Meade, 110 F.3d at\n\n194 n.2 (\"If . . . the directing officer lacked probable cause to\n\norder the arrest, then the arrest itself is unlawful regardless of\n\nthe arresting officer's otherwise proper reliance.\").\n\n           The only basis appellees offer to support a finding of\n\nprobable cause is that most of the other people in the room did\n\nhave   warrants   for   their   arrest    which,   we   will   assume,   were\n\nsupported by probable cause.         But \"mere propinquity to others\n\nindependently suspected of criminal activity does not, without\n\nmore, give rise to probable cause\" for a search or arrest.           Ybarra\n\nv. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 91 (1979).         Rather,\n\n           [w]here the standard is probable cause, a\n           search or seizure of a person must be\n           supported by probable cause particularized\n           with respect to that person. This requirement\n           cannot be undercut or avoided by simply\n           pointing to the fact that coincidentally there\n           exists probable cause to search or seize\n           another or to search the premises where the\n           person may happen to be. The Fourth and\n           Fourteenth Amendments protect the 'legitimate\n           expectations of privacy' of persons, not\n           places.\n\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fId.   Whatever relevance the officers' preparations and confusion\n\nregarding Wilson's presence in the room may have for later stages\n\nof the qualified immunity analysis, see supra note 12, these\n\nfactors do not add up to probable cause that Wilson had committed\n\na crime.   Consequently, the evidence presented at trial supported\n\nthe jury's finding that Wilson's seizure was unreasonable, and\n\nhence that Captain Dunford, as the arresting officer, violated her\n\nFourth Amendment rights.\n\nB.         The Second Prong\n\n           We now inquire \"whether the constitutional right that the\n\nofficer allegedly violated was 'clearly established' at the time of\n\nthe incident such that it would 'be clear to a reasonable officer\n\nthat his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.'\"\n\nRiverdale Mills, 392 F.3d at 65 (quoting Saucier, 533 U.S. at 202).\n\n\"One tried and true way of determining whether this right was\n\nclearly established at the time the defendants acted, is to ask\n\nwhether existing case law gave the defendants fair warning that\n\ntheir conduct violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights.\"\n\nSuboh, 298 F.3d at 93.   This inquiry \"must be undertaken in light\n\nof the specific context of the case, not as a broad general\n\nproposition.\"    Saucier, 533 U.S. at 201.     On the other hand,\n\n\"officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates\n\nestablished law even in novel factual circumstances.\"       Hope v.\n\nPelzer, 536 U.S. 730, 741 (2002).       Consequently, \"the salient\n\n\n                                -24-\n\fquestion . . . is whether the state of the law in [1999] gave\n\n[Dunford] fair warning that [his] alleged treatment of [Wilson] was\n\nunconstitutional.\"        Id.    Finally, we examine \"not only Supreme\n\nCourt precedent, but all available case law,\" Suboh, 298 F.3d at\n\n93, including both federal cases outside our own circuit, Hatch v.\n\nDep't for Children, Youth & Their Families,            274 F.3d 12, 23 (1st\n\nCir. 2001), and state court decisions of the state wherein the\n\nofficers operated, Starlight Sugar, 253 F.3d at 144.\n\n             We conclude that pre-1999 case law gave police officers\n\nample warning that arresting and detaining someone incorrectly\n\nswept   up    in   a   mass   arrest   sting   aimed   at   individuals   with\n\noutstanding arrest warrants would violate her Fourth Amendment\n\nrights.      While the parties have not identified any cases in which\n\nthis issue has arisen in the context of an entirely innocent person\n\nwho unwittingly was caught in a planned mass arrest, courts have\n\naddressed two closely related situations.\n\n             First, it has been clearly established for decades that\n\nif one officer instructs another officer to make an arrest, the\n\narrest violates the Fourth Amendment if the first officer lacked\n\nprobable cause, regardless of how reasonable the second officer's\n\nreliance was.      See Hensley, 469 U.S. at 231; Whiteley, 401 U.S. at\n\n568; Meade, 110 F.3d at 193-94 & n.2.\n\n             Second, it was well established in other federal courts\n\nand in Massachusetts state court, if not in this circuit, that an\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\farrest made on the basis of a facially valid warrant which turns\n\nout to have been cleared before the arrest violates the Fourth\n\nAmendment.    See, e.g., Murray v. City of Chicago, 634 F.2d 365, 366\n\n(7th Cir. 1980) (ten weeks after court quashed and recalled a\n\nwarrant for appellant's arrest, police arrested her on the basis of\n\nthe warrant; court found it \"clear that appellant sustained a\n\nviolation of constitutional rights by being arrested and detained\n\npursuant to an invalid warrant\"); Commonwealth v. Hecox, 619 N.E.2d\n\n339, 340-44 & n.2 (Mass. App. Ct. 1993) (where officer mistakenly\n\nbelieved that a warrant was outstanding for defendant's arrest, but\n\nin fact a warrant either never had issued or had been subsequently\n\ncleared,     arrest   pursuant   to   that   warrant   violated   Fourth\n\nAmendment);13 see also McMurry v. Sheahan, 927 F. Supp. 1082, 1088\n\n(N.D. Ill. 1996) (holding that it was clearly established for\n\nยง 1983 purposes that an arrest founded upon a recalled warrant\n\nviolates the Fourth Amendment).\n\n           If it was clearly established that the Fourth Amendment\n\nproscribes an arrest based on a warrant that was once valid but has\n\nsince been cleared, then a fortiori it was clearly established that\n\nthe amendment proscribes an arrest based on a warrant that never\n\n\n\n     13\n      See also Wayne R. LaFave, 2 Search & Seizure ยง 3.5 & n.105\n(4th ed. 2004) (noting that \"[w]hen the nature of the mistake is\nthat an arrest was made pursuant to an arrest warrant which in fact\nwas quashed before the arrest was made, court[s] are particularly\nready to assert that . . . the Fourth Amendment has been violated,\"\nand collecting state cases).\n\n                                  -26-\n\fexisted in the first place.          Taken together, the two principles\n\ncited above -- that an arrest based on a request by another officer\n\nis lawful only if the first officer had probable cause, and that an\n\narrest based on a facially valid, but actually recalled, warrant\n\nviolates the Fourth Amendment -- gave unmistakable warning to\n\nMassachusetts police that the Fourth Amendment prohibits arresting\n\nsomeone solely on the basis of a nonexistent warrant. We therefore\n\nconclude that the second prong has been satisfied.\n\nC.             The Third Prong\n\n               The final prong of the qualified immunity analysis, often\n\nthe most difficult one for the plaintiff to prevail upon, is\n\n\"whether an objectively reasonable official would have believed\n\nthat     the    action    taken    violated    that    clearly     established\n\nconstitutional right.\"       Starlight Sugar, 253 F.3d at 141.         Section\n\n1983 actions \"frequently turn on the third prong of the qualified\n\nimmunity       inquiry,   which   channels    the   analysis   from   abstract\n\nprinciples to the specific facts of a given case.\"               Cox, 391 F.3d\n\nat 31.    \"It is not always evident at the time an official takes an\n\naction that a clearly established right is involved.              For example,\n\nthe factual situation might be ambiguous or the application of the\n\nlegal standard to the precise facts at issue might be difficult; in\n\neither case the officer's actions may be objectively reasonable and\n\nshe may be entitled to qualified immunity.\"            Riverdale Mills, 392\n\nF.3d at 61.       \"Because 'the concern of the immunity inquiry is to\n\n\n                                     -27-\n\facknowledge that reasonable mistakes can be made as to the legal\n\nconstraints on particular police conduct,' even where a plaintiff\n\nhas shown . . . that a government official may have deprived him of\n\na clearly established constitutional right, qualified immunity\n\nremains available to defendants who demonstrate that they acted\n\nobjectively reasonably in applying clearly established law to the\n\nspecific facts they faced.\"   Burke v. Town of Walpole, 405 F.3d 66,\n\n86 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Saucier, 533 U.S. at 205).14\n\n           In this case, the \"added measure of protection\" provided\n\nby qualified immunity, Cox, 391 F.3d at 31, suffices to protect\n\nDunford.   To be sure, the objective reasonableness of Wilson's\n\ndetention deteriorated as events unfolded. At the beginning of the\n\nencounter, when she was simply one of a hundred people in a\n\nconvention hall that was supposedly carefully screened to contain\n\nonly police officers and persons with outstanding arrest warrants,\n\nthe odds were extremely high that there was a warrant for Wilson's\n\narrest. That fact made it objectively reasonable for an officer in\n\nDunford's position to believe that arresting Wilson would not\n\nviolate the Fourth Amendment.\n\n           Later, when the police became aware that the carefully\n\nprepared processing table contained no folder or photograph for\n\n\n\n     14\n      This principle reflects the difference between the probable\ncause standard under the Fourth Amendment and the objective\nreasonableness standard under the third prong of the ยง 1983\nqualified immunity test. See supra Part III.A.\n\n                                -28-\n\fher, the reasonableness of her continued detention diminished.\n\nNevertheless, the police could have hypothesized that her folder\n\nhad been misplaced, and it was not objectively unreasonable to\n\ndelay releasing her from custody pending final verification of her\n\nstatus.       See Rogers v. Powell, 120 F.3d 446, 456 (3d Cir. 1997).\n\n              There remains the approximately thirty minutes during\n\nwhich the police completed routine paperwork and awaited a cuff\n\ncutter after they had reached the inescapable conclusion that there\n\nhad never been a warrant for Wilson's arrest.        Although the issue\n\nis close, we conclude that Dunford continued to enjoy qualified\n\nimmunity during this final thirty minutes of detention. Cf. id. at\n\n456-57 (holding that police did not enjoy qualified immunity for a\n\nperiod where they acknowledged that plaintiff had to be released,\n\nbut nevertheless kept him handcuffed).        After confirming Wilson's\n\nidentity and her lack of a warrant, Dunford ordered the officers to\n\nrelease her; subsequent delay arose from routine paperwork and time\n\nwaiting for a \"cuff cutter\" to arrive. Qualified immunity protects\n\n\"all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the\n\nlaw.\"     Malley v. Briggs, 475 U.S. 335, 341 (1986).         The delay in\n\neffecting Wilson's release, while undoubtedly exasperating to her,\n\nwas     due    to   simple   administrative   inefficiency,    not   plain\n\n\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fincompetence or knowing violation of the law.        Consequently, we\n\naffirm the district court's judgment in favor of Dunford.15\n\n                                 IV.\n\n          We now address the City's liability.      The district court\n\ngranted   summary   judgment   for   the   City   because   there   was\n\ninsufficient evidence that Operation Goodwin was a City policy. We\n\nreview a grant of summary judgment de novo, viewing the record in\n\nthe light most favorable to the non-movant.       Rosenberg v. City of\n\nEverett, 328 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          The fact that Dunford prevailed on the qualified immunity\n\ndefense does not help the City.         Municipalities cannot assert\n\nqualified immunity.     See Owen v. City of Independence, 445 U.S.\n\n622, 650 (1980).    And the jury did find that Wilson suffered a\n\nconstitutional injury.     However, \"a municipality cannot be held\n\nliable solely because it employs a tortfeasor -- or, in other\n\nwords, a municipality cannot be held liable under ยง 1983 on a\n\nrespondeat superior theory.\"    Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 436\n\nU.S. 658, 691 (1978).    Rather, a municipality is liable only \"when\n\nexecution of a government's policy or custom, whether made by its\n\nlawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to\n\nrepresent official policy, inflicts the injury.\"      Id. at 694.\n\n\n\n\n     15\n      Because the qualified immunity question should not have been\nsubmitted to the jury in the first place, see supra note 10, we do\nnot owe any deference to the jury's answer to that question.\n\n                                 -30-\n\f            Wilson argues that her injury stemmed from City policy\n\nbecause Captain Dunford had final authority to establish such\n\npolicy for Operation Goodwin.16          See Pembaur v. City of Cincinnati,\n\n475 U.S. 469, 481-83 (1986) (plurality opinion) (describing the\n\nlevel of decision-making authority necessary to establish municipal\n\nliability); Cordero v. De Jesus-Mendez, 867 F.2d 1, 7-8 (1st Cir.\n\n1989) (acknowledging Pembaur plurality opinion as law of this\n\ncircuit).    Pembaur held that\n\n            [m]unicipal liability attaches only where the\n            decisionmaker possesses final authority to\n            establish municipal policy with respect to the\n            action ordered. . . . [P]articular officers\n            may have authority to establish binding [city]\n            policy respecting particular matters and to\n            adjust that policy for the [city] in changing\n            circumstances. . . . We hold that municipal\n            liability under ยง 1983 attaches where -- and\n            only where -- a deliberate choice to follow a\n            course of action is made from among various\n            alternatives by the official or officials\n            responsible for establishing final policy with\n            respect to the subject matter in question.\n\n475 U.S. at 481-83.       \"An unconstitutional policy . . . may be\n\ninferred from a single decision or act . . . [but] the isolated\n\naction    must   be   taken   by    a    municipal     official       with   'final\n\npolicy-making    authority'    in       the    relevant   area   of    the   city's\n\nbusiness.\"   Roma Constr. Co. v. aRusso, 96 F.3d 566, 576 (1st Cir.\n\n\n     16\n      Wilson also fleetingly adverts to the allegedly inadequate\ntraining of the line officers in how to react if an innocent\nbystander was caught in the sting. If this is supposed to be an\nargument that there was a policy of inadequate training, we deem it\nwaived by insufficient argumentation. United States v. Zannino,\n895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                        -31-\n\f1996)   (quotation   marks   and   citation   omitted;   alterations   in\n\noriginal).\n\n            Not every police operation is a municipal policy; Wilson\n\nhas the burden of establishing that this particular operation was\n\nCity policy.    She argues that Operation Goodwin was City policy\n\nbecause it was (1) a large operation involving arrest warrants from\n\nall over Boston, (2) commanded by a high-ranking officer, and (3)\n\nvideotaped for national distribution.          Those facts, however, do\n\nnot make it an official City policy.          Wilson offers no evidence\n\nthat Dunford -- then a captain assigned to a station in Dorchester,\n\nsubject to the hierarchical supervision of a Deputy Superintendent,\n\nSuperintendent, and Police Commissioner -- had the authority to set\n\nmunicipal policy for the City of Boston.        We therefore affirm the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment for the City.\n\n                                    V.\n\n            We conclude that the jury's finding that Captain Dunford\n\nviolated Wilson's Fourth Amendment rights is supported by the\n\nevidence.    However, as a matter of law, Dunford is not liable\n\nbecause he enjoys qualified immunity, and the City is not liable\n\nbecause there was insufficient evidence that Operation Goodwin was\n\nCity policy.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -32-\n\f",

Plaintiff-appellant Niquicia Wilson, who had no criminal record and was never subject to an arrest warrant, was mistakenly swept up in the arrest. As a result of this experience, she sued various arresting officers and the City of Boston under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and state law. The district court granted summary judgment to the City, but the rest of the case went to trial. Wilson prevailed at trial against Captain Robert Dunford, who planned and commanded the operation and was the arresting officer. However, the court granted judgment notwithstanding the verdict for Dunford on the basis of qualified immunity. That ruling is the principal subject of this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the jury was entitled to conclude that Wilson's arrest was an unreasonable seizure prohibited by the Fourth Amendment. Nevertheless, we find that Dunford was entitled to qualified immunity because an objectively reasonable officer in his position could have believed that his conduct would not violate the Fourth Amendment. We also agree with the district court's resolution of other issues presented on appeal. Consequently, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the case was tried to a jury, we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the verdict. <i>United States v. Castellini,</i> 392 F.3d 35, 39 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring of 1999, plaintiff-appellant Niquicia Wilson, an eighteen-year-old student with no criminal history, and her boyfriend, Jean Cassamajor, received a letter in the mail. The letter, addressed to Cassamajor, came from John Goodwin, who supposedly represented a company called Madrid International that was planning to act as a job broker to hire a large number of people for work on Boston's \"Big Dig\" construction project. The letter invited Cassamajor to attend a job fair on Sunday, June 27, 1999 at the Bayside Expo Center in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Wilson was excited by the prospect of stable, long-term employment for Cassamajor, and encouraged him to attend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the day of the job fair, Wilson drove Cassamajor to the Bayside Expo Center, parked the car, and accompanied him into the lobby of the exhibition hall. Cassamajor went to check in at a staffed registration table, and Wilson went to a nearby vending machine to buy a soda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Suddenly she heard a commotion, and saw that two or more men had tackled Cassamajor and thrown him to the floor. One of the men yelled to Cassamajor that he was under arrest, and Wilson inferred (correctly) that the men were plain-clothed police officers. The officers pushed Cassamajor through a set of double doors into the exhibition hall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilson approached the officers and asked what was happening. They instructed her to go into the exhibition hall, and \"nudged\" or encouraged her in the direction of the doors. Not wanting to receive the same treatment as Cassamajor, Wilson complied and entered the hall. There were approximately 105 people seated in the hall, and a larger number of police officers. Wilson saw that Cassamajor (now handcuffed) was sitting near the front, and she sat down behind him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellee Captain Robert Dunford of the Boston Police Department (\"BPD\") was standing at a podium in the front of the room.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> He told the assembled group that they were all under arrest and that everyone should sit calmly. Not everyone complied &#8212; some of those present yelled at the officers &#8212; but Wilson sat calmly. At some point Dunford and other police officers explained that everyone in the room was under arrest for outstanding warrants, and Wilson realized that the \"job fair\" was in fact a sting operation. Someone shouted a question regarding what would happen to arrestees who did not actually have a warrant outstanding. Captain Dunford responded that if the person did not have a warrant, the police \"would square that away later.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilson informed a nearby officer that she was only at the hall to drop her boyfriend off, and that if he checked he would see that there was no warrant for her arrest. The officer told her to sit down. Another arrestee had also told officers that he was in the hall by mistake, and a Detective Arnstein summoned Captain Dunford to talk to that person and Wilson. After Wilson explained her situation to Dunford, he replied \"fine, we are just going to check you to make sure that the story you are telling us is the truth and if that is determined, you are free to leave.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At police instructions, Wilson remained seated for \"a very long time.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> She did not speak up at this point because, she later explained, \"I didn't want to get roughed up. Some people were being roughed up. I didn't want that to happen to me.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police took arrestees in groups to a table at the back of the hall for processing. When Wilson's section was finally called &#8212; it was the last section &#8212; she was handcuffed and moved towards the processing table. All along the way, she repeatedly insisted that she had no warrants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the processing table, Detective Janine Mitchell (a defendant below, but not before us on appeal) was matching arrestees to folders compiled in advance. Upon realizing that there was no folder for Wilson, Mitchell inquired if she had any aliases, such as \"Nicky,\" \"Tonya,\" or \"Nicole.\" Wilson stated that she did not. Eventually, after about fifteen minutes, Mitchell led Wilson outside the building to stand near a van with a computerized warrant checking system. Wilson asked to be taken inside due to the heat, but Mitchell said words to the effect of, \"We know you're lying and until you tell us the truth, you'll sit out here.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officer inside the van asked Wilson for identification, and she produced a valid Massachusetts driver's license. The officer continued to check for outstanding warrants under names such as \"Nicky Wilson\" or \"Tonya Wilson.\" After about half an hour, having concluded that there was in fact no warrant for Wilson's arrest, the officers sent for Captain Dunford.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Dunford arrived, he asked Wilson for identification, and she again produced her driver's license. Finally, realizing the error, he explained that she would be released as soon as the police could fill out an \"incident report.\" In the meantime, she was moved back into the auditorium. It took the officers another ten minutes to write the incident report, which was noted as completed at 11:30 AM and which stated in relevant part: \"Suspect above was placed under arrest as a result of Operation Madrid.... Subsequent warrant check revealed suspect to have no outstanding warrants.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> It took another twenty minutes to await a \"cuff cutter\" who could cut off her plastic handcuffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After her handcuffs were cut, Wilson was free to leave. The entire incident had taken a little under two hours. She went to the parking lot and found her boyfriend Cassamajor, who, it turned out, did not have an outstanding warrant either.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"job fair\" had been about three months in the making. The BPD had a longstanding problem with outstanding arrest warrants (due in part to erroneous names, addresses, and so forth), and by early 1999 there were some 14,000 warrants outstanding. Captain Dunford conceived a plan, code named \"Operation Goodwin,\" to help solve the problem by luring suspects to a fictitious job fair and then arresting them en masse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BPD mailed a letter with a job application to the targets of the 14,000 outstanding warrants. About 6,500 of those letters were returned for having bad addresses. In other cases, the BPD learned that the suspect had died or left the jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BPD took other measures to whittle the list. In some cases, the suspect was arrested on another matter and therefore no longer needed to be part of Operation Goodwin. In other cases, the BPD determined that the warrant had been cleared in court (e.g., a fine had been paid) and the department's computerized warrant system was simply not up to date. After all the fine-tuning, the list was narrowed to some 300 persons. The BPD sent them a second letter with an invitation to a June 27, 1999 job fair at the Bayside Expo Center and requested an RSVP. Of those 300, 192 responded. One of the 192 was Wilson's boyfriend Cassamajor, who had once been the subject of an arrest warrant which, apparently unbeknownst to the BPD, had already been cleared.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan for the event called for civilian BPD employees to staff registration tables at the hall entrance. These employees would verify that each arriving person was on the list of the 200 persons who had indicated that they planned to attend the event. Captain Dunford anticipated that some of the recipients might bring family members or friends, or that random passers-by might wander in. If an uninvited person presented himself at the registration table, he would be told that the event was invitation-only and a similar event would be held in a few weeks. The registration table was the only point at which entrants were checked to ensure that they were actually invited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once a \"job fair\" attendee was verified at the registration table, he would be directed to alphabetically organized seats. Plainclothed police \"spotters\" would be interspersed among the attendees in case anyone had a weapon. At 10:00 AM, Captain Dunford would ascend the podium and announce that everyone was under arrest. Police arrest teams would then enter and secure the room. Arrestees would be taken by rows to a processing table at the rear of the hall, where officers would have alphabetically organized folders containing each arrestee's photograph, outstanding warrants, and a pre-filled arrest report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Dunford, the plan provided that the processing table would be the point at which the BPD would deal with arrestees who claimed that they did not have a warrant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The plan was that \"[s]ince [the BPD] had folders on every person who was supposed to be there with their photo ... if anyone did get into the hall by mistake, we could clarify it right there.\" For example, if an arrestee presented documentation stating that the warrant had been cleared (e.g., a receipt from the court stating that a fine had been paid), he would be released. Alternatively, if it turned out that an arrestee simply had the misfortune of sharing a name with someone who actually had an outstanding warrant, the officers at the processing table would realize that the photograph did not match, and would \"be able to immediately look at the photo and say these are two different people and release that person immediately.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of the event, two hours before it was to begin, the BPD rechecked all 200 names on the list to ensure that no one had been arrested, or had his warrant cleared, since the invitations had been mailed. To maintain the element of surprise, the approximately 100 line officers involved were not informed of the operation until just beforehand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the convention center, approximately 105 of the 200 responding invitees appeared and registered. Captain Dunford made the planned arrest announcement a few minutes after 10:00 AM. He was shortly thereafter told that there were two people (not including Wilson) who were in the hall by mistake. Dunford called them out by name, apologized, and personally escorted them to the front reception area. Civilian employees then verified their identification and released them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of the 105 attendees, the vast majority indeed had valid outstanding warrants. Operation Goodwin was essentially complete by noon, several hours ahead of schedule. That afternoon, the BPD held a press conference to announce the operation, at which Captain Dunford spoke and described the sting as a success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilson filed suit in Massachusetts Superior Court against Captain Dunford, Officer Mitchell, three unknown police officers (\"the police defendants\"), the City of Boston, and the Commissioner of the BPD (\"the municipal defendants\"). Against the police defendants, she pled false imprisonment (Count I), intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count II), and violations of various constitutional rights (principally, the right to be free from unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment) under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and the parallel Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167; 11H (Count III). Against the municipal defendants, she pled negligent supervision (Count IV) and a policy or custom of failing to reasonably train and supervise police officers (Count V). The defendants removed the suit to federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled from the bench on cross-motions for summary judgment. It granted the City's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Wilson had failed to establish either that the City had negligently supervised its officers, or that Captain Dunford &#8212; who had conceived and led Operation Goodwin &#8212; was an official policymaker within the meaning of <i>Monell v. Department of Social Services,</i> 436 U.S. 658, 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). The court denied the motions of Dunford and Mitchell &#8212; who had argued both that Wilson's rights were not violated and that they were entitled to qualified immunity &#8212; on the grounds that \"there are factual issues that need to be presented at trial that preclude[] summary judgment in either direction.\" For the same reason, it denied Wilson's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claims against Dunford and Mitchell proceeded to a jury trial. At the close of all the evidence, the district court granted the police defendants' motions for judgment as a matter of law on the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count II). Thus, only three claims remained: false imprisonment (Count I), violation of civil rights under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (Count III), and violation of civil rights under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (also pled as part of Count III). Over both parties' objections, the district court submitted the question of qualified immunity to the jury on a special verdict form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned a verdict for Mitchell on both counts. As to Dunford, the jury found no false imprisonment or violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. However, it found that he had violated Wilson's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure, and that he was not entitled to qualified immunity under &#167; 1983. It awarded nominal damages of one dollar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties moved for judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50. The district court granted Dunford's motion, concluding both that Wilson's detention did not violate the Fourth Amendment and that Dunford was entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law. The court also acknowledged that it had erred in initially submitting the qualified immunity question to the jury. It thus entered judgment as a matter of law for Dunford. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Wilson assigns, by our count, six distinct errors below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Three have been procedurally forfeited and we dispose of them summarily.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The claims that remain are that (1) the evidence established a Fourth Amendment violation, (2) Dunford is not entitled to qualified immunity, and (3) the City is liable under <i>Monell</i> because Dunford was a policymaker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with some observations about our standard of review. The posture of this case is somewhat unusual. Typically, a &#167; 1983 defendant raises the qualified immunity issue either in a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) or a motion for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. <i>See Cox v. Hainey,</i> 391 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.2004) (noting that \"applicability vel non of the qualified immunity doctrine should be determined at the earliest practicable stage in the case\"); <i>see also Mitchell v. Forsyth,</i> 472 U.S. 511, 526, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985) (value of defense \"is effectively lost if a case is erroneously permitted to go to trial\"). If the district court grants one of these dispositive motions, then the plaintiff appeals. If the court denies the motion on legal grounds, the defendant usually takes an interlocutory appeal. <i>See Riverdale Mills Corp. v. Pimpare,</i> 392 F.3d 55, 60 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 200, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001) (explaining that the purpose of qualified immunity is not just to protect the defendant from liability, but also from \"stand[ing] trial or fac[ing] the other burdens of litigation\") (quotation marks omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> In either case, the same analytic framework applies:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This Court has identified a three-step process for evaluating qualified immunity claims: (1) whether the claimant has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right; (2) whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged action or inaction; and (3) if both of these questions are answered in the affirmative, whether an objectively reasonable official would have believed that the action taken violated that clearly established constitutional right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Starlight Sugar, Inc. v.

This is the process for the law's elaboration from case to case, and it is one reason for our insisting upon turning to the existence or nonexistence of a constitutional right as the first inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Id.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court rejected the police defendants' motions for summary judgment on the basis of qualified immunity, and the entire case &#8212; including not only whether Wilson suffered a Fourth Amendment violation, but also whether the police defendants enjoyed qualified immunity for any such violation &#8212; was tried to the jury. After the jury returned a verdict and Dunford moved for judgment as a matter of law, the district court later recognized that the qualified immunity issue was a question of law for the court to decide, notwithstanding any disputed material facts. <i>See Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office,</i> 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir.2002); <i>St. Hilaire v. City of Laconia,</i> 71 F.3d 20, 24 (1st Cir.1995) (\"The ultimate question of qualified immunity should ordinarily be decided by the court.\"); <i>id.</i> at 24 n. 1.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The court concluded that Dunford <i>was</i> entitled to qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This atypical history means that we are in the somewhat unusual position of considering the qualified immunity question for the first time when the case has already been tried. To be sure, this unusual posture does not affect the viability of the qualified immunity defense. <i>See Lampkins v. Thompson,</i> 337 F.3d 1009, 1014 (8th Cir.2003) (describing such a posture as \"procedurally unusual,\" but emphasizing that \"the qualified immunity defense is not waived or lost if a case proceeds to trial\"); <i>Johnson v. Breeden,</i> 280 F.3d 1308, 1317 (11th Cir.2002) (\"Defendants who are not successful with their qualified immunity defense before trial can re-assert it at the end of the plaintiff's case in a Rule 50(a) motion.\"). And, ultimately, \"the procedural posture in which [Wilson's] appeal arises [does not] greatly influence the standard of review.\" <i>Iacobucci v. Boulter,</i> 193 F.3d 14, 23 (1st Cir.1999). Typically, we review a dismissal or grant of summary judgment <i>de novo</i> and construe the allegations or evidence in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <i>See id.</i> at 22. In the present circumstance, \"[w]hen a qualified immunity defense is pressed after a jury verdict, the evidence must be construed in the light most hospitable to the party that prevailed at trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 23. Since Wilson was both the non-movant at the summary judgment stage and the victor before the jury, it makes little difference that we review the qualified immunity question after trial instead of before it. In either case, we construe the facts in the light most favorable to Wilson, and decide legal questions <i>de novo.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having completed that detour, we begin with the first stage of the qualified immunity analysis, and inquire whether the evidence at trial, viewed in the light most favorable to the verdict, is legally sufficient to support the jury's verdict that the plaintiff was deprived of a constitutional right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The First Prong</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Amendment provides that \"[t]he right of the people to be secure in their persons ... against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing ... the persons or things to be seized.\" While the text of the amendment only mentions probable cause in the context of issuing a warrant, decades of case law have established that a warrantless arrest also requires probable cause. <i>E.g., United States v. Meade,</i> 110 F.3d 190, 193 (1st Cir.1997).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most arrests fall into one of several common patterns. In the first scenario, an officer without a warrant suspects that a certain person has just committed, or is about to commit, a crime. In that case, \"[p]robable cause for an arrest exists when the arresting officer, acting upon apparently trustworthy information, reasonably concludes that a crime has been (or is about to be) committed and that the putative arrestee likely is one of the perpetrators.\" <i>Acosta v. Ames Dep't Stores, Inc.,</i> 386 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a second arrest scenario, \"a law enforcement officer [purporting to have] information amounting to probable cause directs an officer who lacks the knowledge to make the arrest.\" <i>Meade,</i> 110 F.3d at 193. In such cases, \"we `impute' to the arresting officer the directing officer's knowledge,\" and thus the arrest stands or falls on what the directing officer knew, not what the arresting officer knew. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a third scenario, a magistrate has issued a warrant for a suspect's arrest. In that case, we essentially ignore the arresting officer's knowledge; the officer need not know anything more than that a facially valid arrest warrant has issued. Rather, we focus entirely on the magistrate's knowledge to determine if the magistrate had \"a substantial basis for determining the existence of probable cause.\" <i>Illinois v. Gates,</i> 462 U.S. 213, 239, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These paradigms do not adequately capture the situation here. Since there was no warrant for Wilson's arrest, this case cannot fall in the third category. But it does not comfortably fit in the first or second categories either. No officer even purports to have drawn the conclusion \"that a crime ha[d] been (or [was] about to be) committed and that [Wilson] likely [was] one of the perpetrators,\" <i>Acosta,</i> 386 F.3d at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is perhaps natural, and appellees understandably seize upon the temptation, to misframe the question. Instead of asking whether there was probable cause to believe that Wilson had committed a crime, appellees pose the issue as whether there was probable cause to believe that a warrant had been issued for her arrest. That is not the correct analysis; it wrongly conflates the Fourth Amendment question of <i>probable cause</i> with the &#167; 1983 question (under the third prong of the qualified immunity test) of <i>objective reasonableness.</i> As the <i>Saucier</i> framework makes clear, courts must first answer the constitutional question as if there were no such thing as qualified immunity, and only then ask whether the additional protections of qualified immunity are available. <i>See</i> 533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151. We must remember that \"the reasonableness standards underlying the probable cause and qualified immunity inquiries are not coterminous.\" <i>Iacobucci,</i> 193 F.3d at 23. In particular, qualified immunity allows for a wider range of mistakes. <i>See Cox,</i> 391 F.3d at 31. Qualified immunity \"eschews a line that separates the constitutional from the unconstitutional and instead draws a line that separates unconstitutional but objectively reasonable acts from obviously unconstitutional acts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 31. In determining whether the Fourth Amendment was violated, we must rigorously draw precisely the line that qualified immunity eschews &#8212; between the constitutional and the unconstitutional &#8212; and not erroneously import the wider latitude afforded by &#167; 1983 into the Constitution itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these basic principles, the Fourth Amendment is not satisfied simply because the police had an objectively reasonable belief that there was a warrant for Wilson's arrest. Indeed, the Fourth Amendment would not necessarily be satisfied even if the police <i>correctly</i> believed that there was a warrant for her arrest. The Fourth Amendment requires that a warrant must be supported by probable cause. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. amend. IV; <i>Gates,</i> 462 U.S. at 239, 103 S.Ct. 2317. And the probable cause that must ground a warrant cannot simply be \"probable cause to believe that there is a warrant.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, the ultimate question for determining whether an arrest violates the Fourth Amendment is, in this context as in any other, whether there was probable cause to believe that the arrestee had committed or was committing a crime.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Under this analysis, Wilson's arrest violated the Fourth Amendment. No officer ever formed the conclusion \"that a crime ha[d] been (or [was] about to be) committed and that [Wilson] likely [was] one of the perpetrators,\" <i>Acosta,</i> 386 F.3d at 9. Nor did any magistrate. Rather, this is a case where each officer thought that some <i>other</i> officer had convinced a magistrate to issue a warrant for Wilson's arrest. And an arrest is not valid simply because the arresting officer thinks that a second officer has adequate justification to arrest a particular person. In such cases, the validity of the arrest turns on whether the second officer <i>actually did</i> have adequate justification to arrest that person:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly police officers called upon to aid other officers in executing arrest warrants are entitled to assume that the officers requesting aid offered the magistrate the information requisite to support an independent judicial assessment of probable cause. Where, however, the contrary turns out to be true, an otherwise illegal arrest cannot be insulated from challenge by the decision of the instigating officer to rely on fellow officers to make the arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Whiteley v. Warden,</i> 401 U.S. 560, 568, 91 S.Ct. 1031, 28 L.Ed.2d 306 (1971); <i>see also United States v. Hensley,</i> 469 U.S. 221, 231, 105 S.Ct. 675, 83 L.Ed.2d 604 (1985) (the validity of an arrest based on a police bulletin \"turns on whether the officers who issued the flyer possessed probable cause to make the arrest. It does not turn on whether those relying on the flyer were themselves aware of the specific facts which led their colleagues to seek their assistance\") (emphasis omitted); <i>Meade,</i> 110 F.3d at 194 n. 2 (\"If ... the directing officer lacked probable cause to order the arrest, then the arrest itself is unlawful regardless of the arresting officer's otherwise proper reliance.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only basis appellees offer to support a finding of probable cause is that most of the other people in the room <i>did</i> have warrants for their arrest which, we will assume, were supported by probable cause. But \"mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not, without more, give rise to probable cause\" for a search or arrest. <i>Ybarra v. Illinois,</i> 444 U.S. 85, 91, 100 S.Ct. 338, 62 L.Ed.2d 238 (1979). Rather,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[w]here the standard is probable cause, a search or seizure of a person must be supported by probable cause particularized with respect to that person. This requirement cannot be undercut or avoided by simply pointing to the fact that coincidentally there exists probable cause to search or seize another or to search the premises where the person may happen to be. The Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments protect the `legitimate expectations of privacy' of persons, not places.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> Whatever relevance the officers' preparations and confusion regarding Wilson's presence in the room may have for later stages of the qualified immunity analysis, <i>see supra</i> note 12, these factors do not add up to probable cause that Wilson had committed a crime. Consequently, the evidence presented at trial supported the jury's finding that Wilson's seizure was unreasonable, and hence that Captain Dunford, as the arresting officer, violated her Fourth Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Second Prong</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now inquire \"whether the constitutional right that the officer allegedly violated was `clearly established' at the time of the incident such that it would `be clear to a reasonable officer that his conduct was unlawful in the situation he confronted.'\" <i>Riverdale Mills,</i> 392 F.3d at 65 (quoting <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 202, 121 S.Ct. 2151). \"One tried and true way of determining whether this right was clearly established at the time the defendants acted, is to ask whether existing case law gave the defendants fair warning that their conduct violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights.\" <i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 93. This inquiry \"must be undertaken in light of the specific context of the case, not as a broad general proposition.\" <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151. On the other hand, \"officials can still be on notice that their conduct violates established law even in novel factual circumstances.\" <i>Hope v. Pelzer,</i> 536 U.S. 730, 741, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002). Consequently, \"the salient question ... is whether the state of the law in [1999] gave [Dunford] fair warning that [his] alleged treatment of [Wilson] was unconstitutional.\" <i>Id.</i> Finally, we examine \"not only Supreme Court precedent, but all available case law,\" <i>Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 93, including both federal cases outside our own circuit, <i>Hatch v. Dep't for Children, Youth &amp; Their Families,</i> 274 F.3d 12, 23 (1st Cir.2001), and state court decisions of the state wherein the officers operated, <i>Starlight Sugar,</i> 253 F.3d at 144.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that pre-1999 case law gave police officers ample warning that arresting and detaining someone incorrectly swept up in a mass arrest sting aimed at individuals with outstanding arrest warrants would violate her Fourth Amendment rights. While the parties have not identified any cases in which this issue has arisen in the context of an entirely innocent person who unwittingly was caught in a planned mass arrest, courts have addressed two closely related situations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, it has been clearly established for decades that if one officer instructs another officer to make an arrest, the arrest violates the Fourth Amendment if the first officer lacked probable cause, regardless of how reasonable the second officer's reliance was. <i>See Hensley,</i> 469 U.S. at 231, 105 S.Ct. 675; <i>Whiteley,</i> 401 U.S. at 568, 91 S.Ct. 1031; <i>Meade,</i> 110 F.3d at 193-94 &amp; n. 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, it was well established in other federal courts and in Massachusetts state court, if not in this circuit, that an arrest made on the basis of a facially valid warrant which turns out to have been cleared before the arrest violates the Fourth Amendment. <i>See, e.g., Murray v. City of Chicago,</i> 634 F.2d 365, 366 (7th Cir.1980) (ten weeks after court quashed and recalled a warrant for appellant's arrest, police arrested her on the basis of the warrant; court found it \"clear that appellant sustained a violation of constitutional rights by being arrested and detained pursuant to an invalid warrant\"); <i>Commonwealth v. Hecox,</i> 35 Mass.App.Ct. 277, 619 N.E.2d 339, 340-44 &amp; n. 2 (1993) (where officer mistakenly believed that a warrant was outstanding for defendant's arrest, but in fact a warrant either never had issued or had been subsequently cleared, arrest pursuant to that warrant violated Fourth Amendment);<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> <i>see also McMurry v. Sheahan,</i> 927 F.Supp. 1082, 1088 (N.D.Ill.1996) (holding that it was clearly established for &#167; 1983 purposes that an arrest founded upon a recalled warrant violates the Fourth Amendment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If it was clearly established that the Fourth Amendment proscribes an arrest based on a warrant that was <i>once</i> valid but has since been cleared, then <i>a fortiori</i> it was clearly established that the amendment proscribes an arrest based on a warrant that never existed in the first place. Taken together, the two principles cited above &#8212; that an arrest based on a request by another officer is lawful only if the first officer had probable cause, and that an arrest based on a facially valid, but actually recalled, warrant violates the Fourth Amendment &#8212; gave unmistakable warning to Massachusetts police that the Fourth Amendment prohibits arresting someone solely on the basis of a nonexistent warrant. We therefore conclude that the second prong has been satisfied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Third Prong</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final prong of the qualified immunity analysis, often the most difficult one for the plaintiff to prevail upon, is \"whether an objectively reasonable official would have believed that the action taken violated that clearly established constitutional right.\" <i>Starlight Sugar,</i> 253 F.3d at 141. Section 1983 actions \"frequently turn on the third prong of the qualified immunity inquiry, which channels the analysis from abstract principles to the specific facts of a given case.\" <i>Cox,</i> 391 F.3d at 31. \"It is not always evident at the time an official takes an action that a clearly established right is involved. For example, the factual situation might be ambiguous or the application of the legal standard to the precise facts at issue might be difficult; in either case the officer's actions may be objectively reasonable and she may be entitled to qualified immunity.\" <i>Riverdale Mills,</i> 392 F.3d at 61. \"Because `the concern of the immunity inquiry is to acknowledge that reasonable mistakes can be made as to the legal constraints on particular police conduct,' even where a plaintiff has shown ... that a government official may have deprived him of a clearly established constitutional right, qualified immunity remains available to defendants who demonstrate that they acted objectively reasonably in applying clearly established law to the specific facts they faced.\" <i>Burke v. Town of Walpole,</i> 405 F.3d 66, 86 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Saucier,</i> 533 U.S. at 205, 121 S.Ct. 2151).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the \"added measure of protection\" provided by qualified immunity, <i>Cox,</i> 391 F.3d at 31, suffices to protect Dunford. To be sure, the objective reasonableness of Wilson's detention deteriorated as events unfolded. At the beginning of the encounter, when she was simply one of a hundred people in a convention hall that was supposedly carefully screened to contain only police officers and persons with outstanding arrest warrants, the odds were extremely high that there was a warrant for Wilson's arrest. That fact made it objectively reasonable for an officer in Dunford's position to believe that arresting Wilson would not violate the Fourth Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later, when the police became aware that the carefully prepared processing table contained no folder or photograph for her, the reasonableness of her continued detention diminished. Nevertheless, the police could have hypothesized that her folder had been misplaced, and it was not objectively unreasonable to delay releasing her from custody pending final verification of her status. <i>See Rogers v. Powell,</i> 120 F.3d 446, 456 (3d Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There remains the approximately thirty minutes during which the police completed routine paperwork and awaited a cuff cutter after they had reached the inescapable conclusion that there had never been a warrant for Wilson's arrest. Although the issue is close, we conclude that Dunford continued to enjoy qualified immunity during this final thirty minutes of detention. <i>Cf. id.</i> at 456-57 (holding that police did not enjoy qualified immunity for a period where they acknowledged that plaintiff had to be released, but nevertheless kept him handcuffed). After confirming Wilson's identity and her lack of a warrant, Dunford ordered the officers to release her; subsequent delay arose from routine paperwork and time waiting for a \"cuff cutter\" to arrive. Qualified immunity protects \"all but the plainly incompetent or those who knowingly violate the law.\" <i>Malley v. Briggs,</i> 475 U.S. 335, 341, 106 S.Ct. 1092, 89 L.Ed.2d 271 (1986). The delay in effecting Wilson's release, while undoubtedly exasperating to her, was due to simple administrative inefficiency, not plain incompetence or knowing violation of the law. Consequently, we affirm the district court's judgment in favor of Dunford.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn15\" id=\"fn15_ref\">15</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now address the City's liability. The district court granted summary judgment for the City because there was insufficient evidence that Operation Goodwin was a City policy. We review a grant of summary judgment <i>de novo,</i> viewing the record in the light most favorable to the non-movant. <i>Rosenberg v. City of Everett,</i> 328 F.3d 12, 17 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that Dunford prevailed on the qualified immunity defense does not help the City. Municipalities cannot assert qualified immunity. <i>See Owen v. City of Independence,</i> 445 U.S. 622, 650, 100 S.Ct. 1398, 63 L.Ed.2d 673 (1980). And the jury did find that Wilson suffered a constitutional injury. However, \"a municipality cannot be held liable <i>solely</i> because it employs a tortfeasor &#8212; or, in other words, a municipality cannot be held liable under &#167; 1983 on a <i>respondeat superior</i> theory.\" <i>Monell v. Dep't of Soc. Servs.,</i> 436 U.S. 658, 691, 98 S.Ct. 2018, 56 L.Ed.2d 611 (1978). Rather, a municipality is liable only \"when execution of a government's policy or custom, whether made by its lawmakers or by those whose edicts or acts may fairly be said to represent official policy, inflicts the injury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 694, 98 S.Ct. 2018.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilson argues that her injury stemmed from City policy because Captain Dunford had final authority to establish such policy for Operation Goodwin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn16\" id=\"fn16_ref\">16</a> <i>See Pembaur v.

She argues that Operation Goodwin was City policy because it was (1) a large operation involving arrest warrants from all over Boston, (2) commanded by a high-ranking officer, and (3) videotaped for national distribution. Those facts, however, do not make it an official City policy. Wilson offers no evidence that Dunford &#8212; then a captain assigned to a station in Dorchester, subject to the hierarchical supervision of a Deputy Superintendent, Superintendent, and Police Commissioner &#8212; had the authority to set municipal policy for the City of Boston. We therefore affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment for the City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the jury's finding that Captain Dunford violated Wilson's Fourth Amendment rights is supported by the evidence. However, as a matter of law, Dunford is not liable because he enjoys qualified immunity, and the City is not liable because there was insufficient evidence that Operation Goodwin was City policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of the District of Columbia, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Dunford is currently the Superintendent of the BPD.

At various times her testimony provides a range of time (e.g., \"[a]bout ten, 15 minutes\"); in such instances we state the higher end of the range. For the first eight minutes after Captain Dunford announced that everyone in the room was under arrest, a videotape of the sting provides some time references, but much of Wilson's testimony cannot be precisely matched to events shown on the videotape. Because we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict for Wilson,<i>see Castellini,</i> 392 F.3d at 39, we generally rely on her depiction of the events that she witnessed, eschewing specificity where the record viewed in this light does not provide it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Wilson asked for a copy of the incident report, but the officers refused.

For example, much of her argument concerning the Fourth Amendment issue lies in a section devoted to challenging the district court's refusal to grant summary judgment in her favor. Strictly speaking, we have no jurisdiction over such a claim because denial of summary judgment is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291<i>See Nieves-Luciano v. Hernandez-Torres,</i> 397 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2005). However, since she properly preserved these issues by moving for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence and then again after the jury verdict, and since there is no prejudice to defendants, we treat this argumentation as if it were aimed at the district court's denial of her motion for judgment as a matter of law, which we have jurisdiction to review.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> First, Wilson argues that the court failed to give a jury instruction that false arrest constitutes \"coercion\" under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. This claim was not preserved because her request for this instruction below was inadequate and untimely, and she did not timely object to the instruction as given<i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c); <i>Gray v. Genlyte Group, Inc.,</i> 289 F.3d 128, 133-34 (1st Cir.2002). Consequently, we review for plain error. <i>Id.</i> at 134. Even if the failure to give this instruction was an error that is plain and would likely affect the outcome, it would not be \"sufficiently fundamental to threaten the fairness or integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceeding.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Second, she argues that the jury returned an inconsistent verdict because it found a violation of &#167; 1983 but not of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. She forfeited this argument by failing to object before the jury was discharged, <i>Howard v. Antilla,</i> 294 F.3d 244, 250 (1st Cir.2002), and once again it does not qualify as plain error.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Third, she argues that the court erred by denying her motion for judgment as a matter of law on the false imprisonment claim. The point is inadequately developed, even when we combine it with her argument for reversal of the district court's denial of summary judgment, <i>see supra</i> note 7, and we deem it waived. <i>See United States v.

However, whether the officer's conduct was objectively reasonable under a given set of facts is a question of law for the court. <i>See Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 90; <i>St. Hilaire,</i> 71 F.3d at 24 &amp; n. 1.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The district court analyzed Wilson's detention as if it were not an arrest, but rather an investigatory stop within the meaning of<i>Terry v.

Summers,</i> 452 U.S. 692, 698, 101 S.Ct. 2587, 69 L.Ed.2d 340 (1981). However, both Captain Dunford and Officer Mitchell testified unambiguously that Wilson was under arrest. At any rate, appellees do not argue on appeal that Wilson's arrest should be treated as a mere <i>Terry</i> stop, and we see no reason to treat it as one.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn12\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12_ref\">12</a>\n        <p> Of course, whether a particular<i>remedy</i> is available for the Fourth Amendment violation may turn on whether the arresting officer reasonably relied on information that, in retrospect, did not constitute probable cause.

Plaintiff-appellant Niquicia Wilson, who had no criminal record and was never subject to an arrest warrant, was mistakenly swept up in the arrest. As a result of this experience, she sued various arresting officers and the City of Boston under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and state law. The district court granted summary judgment to the City, but the rest of the case went to trial. Wilson prevailed at trial against Captain Robert Dunford, who planned and commanded the operation and was the arresting officer.

The letter, addressed to Cassamajor, came from John Goodwin, who supposedly represented a company called Madrid International that was planning to act as a job broker to hire a large number of people for work on Boston's \"Big Dig\" construction project. The letter invited Cassamajor to attend a job fair on Sunday, June 27, 1999 at the Bayside Expo Center in Dorchester, Massachusetts. Wilson was excited by the prospect of stable, long-term employment for Cassamajor, and encouraged him to attend.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the day of the job fair, Wilson drove Cassamajor to the Bayside Expo Center, parked the car, and accompanied him into the lobby of the exhibition hall. Cassamajor went to check in at a staffed registration table, and Wilson went to a nearby vending machine to buy a soda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Suddenly she heard a commotion, and saw that two or more men had tackled Cassamajor and thrown him to the floor. One of the men yelled to Cassamajor that he was under arrest, and Wilson inferred (correctly) that the men were plain-clothed police officers. The officers pushed Cassamajor through a set of double doors into the exhibition hall.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilson approached the officers and asked what was happening. They instructed her to go into the exhibition hall, and \"nudged\" or encouraged her in the direction of the doors. Not wanting to receive the same treatment as Cassamajor, Wilson complied and entered the hall. There were approximately 105 people seated in the hall, and a larger number of police officers. Wilson saw that Cassamajor (now handcuffed) was sitting near the front, and she sat down behind him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant-appellee Captain Robert Dunford of the Boston Police Department (\"BPD\") was standing at a podium in the front of the room.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> He told the assembled group that they were all under arrest and that everyone should sit calmly. Not everyone complied &#8212; some of those present yelled at the officers &#8212; but Wilson sat calmly. At some point Dunford and other police officers explained that everyone in the room was under arrest for outstanding warrants, and Wilson realized that the \"job fair\" was in fact a sting operation. Someone shouted a question regarding what would happen to arrestees who did not actually have a warrant outstanding. Captain Dunford responded that if the person did not have a warrant, the police \"would square that away later.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilson informed a nearby officer that she was only at the hall to drop her boyfriend off, and that if he checked he would see that there was no warrant for her arrest. The officer told her to sit down. Another arrestee had also told officers that he was in the hall by mistake, and a Detective Arnstein summoned Captain Dunford to talk to that person and Wilson. After Wilson explained her situation to Dunford, he replied \"fine, we are just going to check you to make sure that the story you are telling us is the truth and if that is determined, you are free to leave.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At police instructions, Wilson remained seated for \"a very long time.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> She did not speak up at this point because, she later explained, \"I didn't want to get roughed up. Some people were being roughed up. I didn't want that to happen to me.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The police took arrestees in groups to a table at the back of the hall for processing. When Wilson's section was finally called &#8212; it was the last section &#8212; she was handcuffed and moved towards the processing table. All along the way, she repeatedly insisted that she had no warrants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the processing table, Detective Janine Mitchell (a defendant below, but not before us on appeal) was matching arrestees to folders compiled in advance. Upon realizing that there was no folder for Wilson, Mitchell inquired if she had any aliases, such as \"Nicky,\" \"Tonya,\" or \"Nicole.\" Wilson stated that she did not. Eventually, after about fifteen minutes, Mitchell led Wilson outside the building to stand near a van with a computerized warrant checking system. Wilson asked to be taken inside due to the heat, but Mitchell said words to the effect of, \"We know you're lying and until you tell us the truth, you'll sit out here.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officer inside the van asked Wilson for identification, and she produced a valid Massachusetts driver's license. The officer continued to check for outstanding warrants under names such as \"Nicky Wilson\" or \"Tonya Wilson.\" After about half an hour, having concluded that there was in fact no warrant for Wilson's arrest, the officers sent for Captain Dunford.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Dunford arrived, he asked Wilson for identification, and she again produced her driver's license. Finally, realizing the error, he explained that she would be released as soon as the police could fill out an \"incident report.\" In the meantime, she was moved back into the auditorium. It took the officers another ten minutes to write the incident report, which was noted as completed at 11:30 AM and which stated in relevant part: \"Suspect above was placed under arrest as a result of Operation Madrid.... Subsequent warrant check revealed suspect to have no outstanding warrants.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> It took another twenty minutes to await a \"cuff cutter\" who could cut off her plastic handcuffs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After her handcuffs were cut, Wilson was free to leave. The entire incident had taken a little under two hours. She went to the parking lot and found her boyfriend Cassamajor, who, it turned out, did not have an outstanding warrant either.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"job fair\" had been about three months in the making. The BPD had a longstanding problem with outstanding arrest warrants (due in part to erroneous names, addresses, and so forth), and by early 1999 there were some 14,000 warrants outstanding. Captain Dunford conceived a plan, code named \"Operation Goodwin,\" to help solve the problem by luring suspects to a fictitious job fair and then arresting them en masse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BPD mailed a letter with a job application to the targets of the 14,000 outstanding warrants. About 6,500 of those letters were returned for having bad addresses. In other cases, the BPD learned that the suspect had died or left the jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BPD took other measures to whittle the list. In some cases, the suspect was arrested on another matter and therefore no longer needed to be part of Operation Goodwin. In other cases, the BPD determined that the warrant had been cleared in court (e.g., a fine had been paid) and the department's computerized warrant system was simply not up to date. After all the fine-tuning, the list was narrowed to some 300 persons. The BPD sent them a second letter with an invitation to a June 27, 1999 job fair at the Bayside Expo Center and requested an RSVP. Of those 300, 192 responded. One of the 192 was Wilson's boyfriend Cassamajor, who had once been the subject of an arrest warrant which, apparently unbeknownst to the BPD, had already been cleared.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plan for the event called for civilian BPD employees to staff registration tables at the hall entrance. These employees would verify that each arriving person was on the list of the 200 persons who had indicated that they planned to attend the event. Captain Dunford anticipated that some of the recipients might bring family members or friends, or that random passers-by might wander in. If an uninvited person presented himself at the registration table, he would be told that the event was invitation-only and a similar event would be held in a few weeks. The registration table was the only point at which entrants were checked to ensure that they were actually invited.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once a \"job fair\" attendee was verified at the registration table, he would be directed to alphabetically organized seats. Plainclothed police \"spotters\" would be interspersed among the attendees in case anyone had a weapon. At 10:00 AM, Captain Dunford would ascend the podium and announce that everyone was under arrest. Police arrest teams would then enter and secure the room. Arrestees would be taken by rows to a processing table at the rear of the hall, where officers would have alphabetically organized folders containing each arrestee's photograph, outstanding warrants, and a pre-filled arrest report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Dunford, the plan provided that the processing table would be the point at which the BPD would deal with arrestees who claimed that they did not have a warrant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The plan was that \"[s]ince [the BPD] had folders on every person who was supposed to be there with their photo ... if anyone did get into the hall by mistake, we could clarify it right there.\" For example, if an arrestee presented documentation stating that the warrant had been cleared (e.g., a receipt from the court stating that a fine had been paid), he would be released. Alternatively, if it turned out that an arrestee simply had the misfortune of sharing a name with someone who actually had an outstanding warrant, the officers at the processing table would realize that the photograph did not match, and would \"be able to immediately look at the photo and say these are two different people and release that person immediately.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of the event, two hours before it was to begin, the BPD rechecked all 200 names on the list to ensure that no one had been arrested, or had his warrant cleared, since the invitations had been mailed. To maintain the element of surprise, the approximately 100 line officers involved were not informed of the operation until just beforehand.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the convention center, approximately 105 of the 200 responding invitees appeared and registered. Captain Dunford made the planned arrest announcement a few minutes after 10:00 AM. He was shortly thereafter told that there were two people (not including Wilson) who were in the hall by mistake. Dunford called them out by name, apologized, and personally escorted them to the front reception area. Civilian employees then verified their identification and released them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of the 105 attendees, the vast majority indeed had valid outstanding warrants. Operation Goodwin was essentially complete by noon, several hours ahead of schedule. That afternoon, the BPD held a press conference to announce the operation, at which Captain Dunford spoke and described the sting as a success.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilson filed suit in Massachusetts Superior Court against Captain Dunford, Officer Mitchell, three unknown police officers (\"the police defendants\"), the City of Boston, and the Commissioner of the BPD (\"the municipal defendants\"). Against the police defendants, she pled false imprisonment (Count I), intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count II), and violations of various constitutional rights (principally, the right to be free from unreasonable seizure under the Fourth Amendment) under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and the parallel Massachusetts Civil Rights Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 12, &#167; 11H (Count III). Against the municipal defendants, she pled negligent supervision (Count IV) and a policy or custom of failing to reasonably train and supervise police officers (Count V). The defendants removed the suit to federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court ruled from the bench on cross-motions for summary judgment. It granted the City's motion for summary judgment on the grounds that Wilson had failed to establish either that the City had negligently supervised its officers, or that Captain Dunford &#8212; who had conceived and led Operation Goodwin &#8212; was an official policymaker within the meaning of <i>Monell v. Department of Social Services,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span>, 694, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109881\"><a href=\"/opinion/109881/monell-v-new-york-city-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span> (1978). The court denied the motions of Dunford and Mitchell &#8212; who had argued both that Wilson's rights were not violated and that they were entitled to qualified immunity &#8212; on the grounds that \"there are factual issues that need to be presented at trial that preclude[] summary judgment in either direction.\" For the same reason, it denied Wilson's motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The claims against Dunford and Mitchell proceeded to a jury trial. At the close of all the evidence, the district court granted the police defendants' motions for judgment as a matter of law on the claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress (Count II). Thus, only three claims remained: false imprisonment (Count I), violation of civil rights under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 (Count III), and violation of civil rights under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act (also pled as part of Count III). Over both parties' objections, the district court submitted the question of qualified immunity to the jury on a special verdict form.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury returned a verdict for Mitchell on both counts. As to Dunford, the jury found no false imprisonment or violation of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. However, it found that he had violated Wilson's Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable seizure, and that he was not entitled to qualified immunity under &#167; 1983. It awarded nominal damages of one dollar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties moved for judgment as a matter of law under Fed.R.Civ.P. 50. The district court granted Dunford's motion, concluding both that Wilson's detention did not violate the Fourth Amendment and that Dunford was entitled to qualified immunity as a matter of law. The court also acknowledged that it had erred in initially submitting the qualified immunity question to the jury. It thus entered judgment as a matter of law for Dunford. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Wilson assigns, by our count, six distinct errors below.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Three have been procedurally forfeited and we dispose of them summarily.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> The claims that remain are that (1) the evidence established a Fourth Amendment violation, (2) Dunford is not entitled to qualified immunity, and (3) the City is liable under <i>Monell</i> because Dunford was a policymaker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with some observations about our standard of review. The posture of this case is somewhat unusual. Typically, a &#167; 1983 defendant raises the qualified immunity issue either in a motion to dismiss under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6) or a motion for summary judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. <i>See Cox v.

If the district court grants one of these dispositive motions, then the plaintiff appeals.

After the jury returned a verdict and Dunford moved for judgment as a matter of law, the district court later recognized that the qualified immunity issue was a question of law for the court to decide, notwithstanding any disputed material facts. <i>See Suboh v.

Since there was no warrant for Wilson's arrest, this case cannot fall in the third category. But it does not comfortably fit in the first or second categories either. No officer even purports to have drawn the conclusion \"that a crime ha[d] been (or [was] about to be) committed and that [Wilson] likely [was] one of the perpetrators,\" <i>Acosta,</i> 386 F.3d at 9.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is perhaps natural, and appellees understandably seize upon the temptation, to misframe the question. Instead of asking whether there was probable cause to believe that Wilson had committed a crime, appellees pose the issue as whether there was probable cause to believe that a warrant had been issued for her arrest. That is not the correct analysis; it wrongly conflates the Fourth Amendment question of <i>probable cause</i> with the &#167; 1983 question (under the third prong of the qualified immunity test) of <i>objective reasonableness.</i> As the <i>Saucier</i> framework makes clear, courts must first answer the constitutional question as if there were no such thing as qualified immunity, and only then ask whether the additional protections of qualified immunity are available. <i>See</i> 533 U.S. at 201, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2151</span></span>. We must remember that \"the reasonableness standards underlying the probable cause and qualified immunity inquiries are not coterminous.\" <i>Iacobucci,</i> 193 F.3d at 23. In particular, qualified immunity allows for a wider range of mistakes. <i>See Cox,</i> 391 F.3d at 31. Qualified immunity \"eschews a line that separates the constitutional from the unconstitutional and instead draws a line that separates unconstitutional but objectively reasonable acts from obviously unconstitutional acts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 31. In determining whether the Fourth Amendment was violated, we must rigorously draw precisely the line that qualified immunity eschews &#8212; between the constitutional and the unconstitutional &#8212; and not erroneously import the wider latitude afforded by &#167; 1983 into the Constitution itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these basic principles, the Fourth Amendment is not satisfied simply because the police had an objectively reasonable belief that there was a warrant for Wilson's arrest. Indeed, the Fourth Amendment would not necessarily be satisfied even if the police <i>correctly</i> believed that there was a warrant for her arrest. The Fourth Amendment requires that a warrant must be supported by probable cause. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. amend. IV; <i>Gates,</i> 462 U.S. at 239, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110959\"><a href=\"/opinion/110959/illinois-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

No officer ever formed the conclusion \"that a crime ha[d] been (or [was] about to be) committed and that [Wilson] likely [was] one of the perpetrators,\" <i>Acosta,</i> 386 F.3d at 9. Nor did any magistrate. Rather, this is a case where each officer thought that some <i>other</i> officer had convinced a magistrate to issue a warrant for Wilson's arrest. And an arrest is not valid simply because the arresting officer thinks that a second officer has adequate justification to arrest a particular person. In such cases, the validity of the arrest turns on whether the second officer <i>actually did</i> have adequate justification to arrest that person:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly police officers called upon to aid other officers in executing arrest warrants are entitled to assume that the officers requesting aid offered the magistrate the information requisite to support an independent judicial assessment of probable cause.

Taken together, the two principles cited above &#8212; that an arrest based on a request by another officer is lawful only if the first officer had probable cause, and that an arrest based on a facially valid, but actually recalled, warrant violates the Fourth Amendment &#8212; gave unmistakable warning to Massachusetts police that the Fourth Amendment prohibits arresting someone solely on the basis of a nonexistent warrant.

To be sure, the objective reasonableness of Wilson's detention deteriorated as events unfolded. At the beginning of the encounter, when she was simply one of a hundred people in a convention hall that was supposedly carefully screened to contain only police officers and persons with outstanding arrest warrants, the odds were extremely high that there was a warrant for Wilson's arrest.

After confirming Wilson's identity and her lack of a warrant, Dunford ordered the officers to release her; subsequent delay arose from routine paperwork and time waiting for a \"cuff cutter\" to arrive.

She argues that Operation Goodwin was City policy because it was (1) a large operation involving arrest warrants from all over Boston, (2) commanded by a high-ranking officer, and (3) videotaped for national distribution. Those facts, however, do not make it an official City policy. Wilson offers no evidence that Dunford &#8212; then a captain assigned to a station in Dorchester, subject to the hierarchical supervision of a Deputy Superintendent, Superintendent, and Police Commissioner &#8212; had the authority to set municipal policy for the City of Boston. We therefore affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment for the City.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that the jury's finding that Captain Dunford violated Wilson's Fourth Amendment rights is supported by the evidence. However, as a matter of law, Dunford is not liable because he enjoys qualified immunity, and the City is not liable because there was insufficient evidence that Operation Goodwin was City policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of the District of Columbia, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Dunford is currently the Superintendent of the BPD.

At various times her testimony provides a range of time (e.g., \"[a]bout ten, 15 minutes\"); in such instances we state the higher end of the range. For the first eight minutes after Captain Dunford announced that everyone in the room was under arrest, a videotape of the sting provides some time references, but much of Wilson's testimony cannot be precisely matched to events shown on the videotape. Because we recite the facts in the light most favorable to the jury's verdict for Wilson,<i>see Castellini,</i> 392 F.3d at 39, we generally rely on her depiction of the events that she witnessed, eschewing specificity where the record viewed in this light does not provide it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Wilson asked for a copy of the incident report, but the officers refused. She eventually obtained it through counsel</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The record does not indicate whether Cassamajor filed suit</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> This was apparently the meaning of his remark that if a arrestee had no warrant, the police \"would square that away later.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The record contains information, ultimately not presented at trial, suggesting that the briefing was incomplete in comparison to Captain Dunford's plan. For example, the officers at the processing table were not instructed on what to do in case an arrestee claimed she was present by mistake</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> We construe her assignments of error generously and ignore certain defects in her argument. For example, much of her argument concerning the Fourth Amendment issue lies in a section devoted to challenging the district court's refusal to grant summary judgment in her favor. Strictly speaking, we have no jurisdiction over such a claim because denial of summary judgment is not appealable under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291<i>See Nieves-Luciano v. Hernandez-Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"789135\"><a href=\"/opinion/789135/milton-nieves-luciano-gerardina-rivera-galvan-shawn-nieves-rivera-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2005). However, since she properly preserved these issues by moving for judgment as a matter of law at the close of all the evidence and then again after the jury verdict, and since there is no prejudice to defendants, we treat this argumentation as if it were aimed at the district court's denial of her motion for judgment as a matter of law, which we have jurisdiction to review.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> First, Wilson argues that the court failed to give a jury instruction that false arrest constitutes \"coercion\" under the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. This claim was not preserved because her request for this instruction below was inadequate and untimely, and she did not timely object to the instruction as given<i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 51(c); <i>Gray v. Genlyte Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199969\"><a href=\"/opinion/199969/gray-v-genlyte-group-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">289</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, 133-34 (1st Cir.2002). Consequently, we review for plain error. <i>Id.</i> at 134. Even if the failure to give this instruction was an error that is plain and would likely affect the outcome, it would not be \"sufficiently fundamental to threaten the fairness or integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceeding.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Second, she argues that the jury returned an inconsistent verdict because it found a violation of &#167; 1983 but not of the Massachusetts Civil Rights Act. She forfeited this argument by failing to object before the jury was discharged, <i>Howard v. Antilla,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200054\"><a href=\"/opinion/200054/howard-v-antilla/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, 250 (1st Cir.2002), and once again it does not qualify as plain error.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Third, she argues that the court erred by denying her motion for judgment as a matter of law on the false imprisonment claim. The point is inadequately developed, even when we combine it with her argument for reversal of the district court's denial of summary judgment, <i>see supra</i> note 7, and we deem it waived. <i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Here, the defendants probably could not have taken an interlocutory appeal because summary judgment was denied based on factual disputes, not legal questions<i>See Rodr&#237;guez-Rodr&#237;guez v.

However, whether the officer's conduct was objectively reasonable under a given set of facts is a question of law for the court. <i>See Suboh,</i> 298 F.3d at 90; <i>St. Hilaire,</i> 71 F.3d at 24 &amp; n. 1.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn11\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11_ref\">11</a>\n        <p> The district court analyzed Wilson's detention as if it were not an arrest, but rather an investigatory stop within the meaning of<i>Terry v.
