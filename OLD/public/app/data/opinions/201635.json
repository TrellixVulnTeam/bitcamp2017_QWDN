This is an appeal from an order denying\n\nJoseph Jordan's petition for a writ of habeas corpus.                   The issue\n\npresented is whether the district court erred in concluding that\n\nMassachusetts     courts    did   not   deny   Jordan     the   right   of   self-\n\nrepresentation, see Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), or\n\ncertain concomitant procedural rights.            The Massachusetts Appeals\n\nCourt, in a decision that the Supreme Judicial Court declined to\n\nreview, held that Jordan invoked his right to self-representation\n\nbut then later waived it.            The district court decided that this\n\nwaiver   ruling    was     neither    \"contrary    to,       [n]or   involved   an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"                  28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d)(1)(2000).        The court also rebuffed Jordan's claim that\n\nthe   state   court's      decision     was    based    on    \"an    unreasonable\n\ndetermination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in\n\nthe State court proceeding.\" Id. § 2254(d)(2).                  We do not travel\n\nthe same decisional path as the other courts that have evaluated\n\nJordan's Faretta-related claims because, in our view, Jordan only\n\nexpressed a desire to represent himself under certain conditions\n\nand those conditions never materialized.               We therefore affirm the\n\ndenial of the petition on this limited basis.\n\n           In October 1991, a Massachusetts grand jury indicted\n\nJordan on charges of kidnaping, conspiracy to murder, assault by\n\nmeans of a dangerous weapon, and battery.              Jordan was incarcerated\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fpending trial.     The superior court originally appointed attorney\n\nAlan Rubin, the regional supervisor of the Hampshire County office\n\nof the Committee for Public Counsel Services, to represent him. On\n\nMay 4, 1992, Rubin moved to withdraw because of a conflict of\n\ninterest and was granted permission to do so.        That same day, the\n\ncourt appointed attorney Scott Hamilton to replace Rubin and\n\ncontinued Jordan's trial until July 22, 1992.\n\n             In three identical motions, filed with the superior court\n\non June 17, 1992, July 7, 1992, and July 13, 1992 (but prepared and\n\nmailed some time earlier from Jordan's place of incarceration),\n\nJordan expressed dissatisfaction with Hamilton's case preparation.\n\nThese motions, captioned as \"Motion[s] to Proceed Pro Se,\" sought\n\nrelief in the form of (1) dismissal of the charges, (2) transfer of\n\nvenue   to   another   jurisdiction   (presumably    where   another   bar\n\nadvocate or public defender's office would be responsible for\n\ndefending Jordan), (3) that \"[a]n Attorney-At-Law from without the\n\nHampshire County Bar Advocate Program and from without the Public\n\nDefender's Office be appointed to defend [Jordan] concurrently with\n\nthe withdrawl [sic] of the currently appointed Bar Advocate,\" or\n\n(4) that \"[t]he defendant be allowed to proceed Pro Se in this\n\nmatter and, due to the circumstances of this case, that this\n\nHonorable Court appoint a standby counsel.\"         On the final page of\n\nhis submission, Jordan made clear that self-representation was the\n\nleast preferred of the remedies sought:        \"The defendant in this\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fmatter therefore respectfully requests that this Honorable Court\n\nallow one of the foregoing alternatives to his proceeding pro se\n\nor, short of those, allow him to proceed pro se . . . .\"\n\n              On July 8, 1992, Hamilton moved to withdraw as Jordan's\n\ncounsel. The superior court held a hearing on the motion that same\n\nday, with Jordan in attendance. The court denied Hamilton's motion\n\nbecause it did not want to continue the trial again, but it offered\n\nto permit attorney Geri Laventis (whom Hamilton had introduced to\n\nJordan   as    possible      replacement     counsel      the    week   before)   to\n\nparticipate as co-counsel.         Laventis could not participate on the\n\nscheduled trial date so she declined.                  At this point, the court\n\nstated that it would consider appointing co-counsel if the defense\n\nso moved.\n\n              On July 13, 1992, the same day that Jordan's third\n\n\"Motion to Proceed Pro Se\" reached and was filed with the court,\n\nHamilton      acting   for    Jordan   moved      to   appoint    attorney   David\n\nPritchard as co-counsel.         The court granted the motion that same\n\nday. After this motion was granted, Jordan made no further mention\n\nof representing himself and permitted Pritchard and Hamilton to\n\nrepresent him at trial without objection. Moreover, in a letter to\n\nthe superior court's Regional Administrative Justice dated July 13,\n\n1992, but filed August 11, 1992, Jordan reiterated his desire for\n\ncounsel at his trial: \"Regardless of whom is appointed as my\n\ncounsel,    although    I    certainly     hope    that    Ms.    Laventis   be   so\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fappointed,1 I pray that this Honorable Court appoint new counsel\n\nand remove Mr. Hamilton as my counsel as soon as possible.\"                      The\n\nJuly 13 letter made no mention of self-representation or proceeding\n\npro se.        On July 29, 1992, Jordan was convicted on all charges.\n\n               Jordan's entire argument to us is based on the factual\n\npremise that Jordan wished to represent himself and sufficiently\n\ncommunicated          that   wish   to   the    trial   court   to     trigger   the\n\nFaretta (and Faretta derived) rights of which he says he was\n\ndenied.        We reject this factual premise and thus the argument\n\nitself.         We may accept arguendo, as the state appeals court\n\nconcluded, that an assertion of Faretta rights may be efficacious\n\neven if it is only made on the condition that another requested and\n\npreferred form of relief be deprived. See, e.g., Adams v. Carroll,\n\n875 F.2d 1441, 1444-45 (9th Cir. 1989).                 But this does not mean\n\nthat       a   conditional      assertion      of   Faretta   rights    is    always\n\nefficacious. See United States v. Frazier-El, 204 F.3d 553, 558-61\n\n(4th Cir. 2000); id. at 566-67 (Murnaghan, J., dissenting). Where,\n\nas   here,      the   alleged    assertion     of   Faretta   rights    is   clearly\n\nconditioned on the denial of a preferred form of requested relief\n\ninvolving counseled representation, and where, as here, a variant\n\n\n\n       1\n      The reference to Ms. Laventis in the July 13 letter is a bit\nodd, as Laventis had declined the offer to be appointed co-counsel\nfive days earlier at the July 8 hearing. In any event, regardless\nwhether the letter was written on July 13 or shortly before, it is\nclear that the letter was written after the thrice-filed Motion to\nProceed Pro Se was sent to the court.\n\n                                         -5-\n\fof the preferred form of relief is granted without subsequent\n\nobjection or renewal of the request for self representation,2 it\n\nwould undermine the Sixth Amendment to treat the conditional\n\nassertion of Faretta rights as efficacious.         Such a ruling could\n\npave the way for inadvertent waivers of the right to counsel by\n\ndefendants who \"occasional[ly] mus[e] on the benefits of self-\n\nrepresentation,\" Frazier-El, 204 F.3d at 558-59, (citation and\n\ninternal   quotation   marks   omitted),   and   thereby   undermine   the\n\n\"constitutional primacy\" of this right vis-à-vis the right to self-\n\nrepresentation, id. at 559; see United States v. Proctor, 166 F.3d\n\n396, 401 (1st Cir. 1999).       We are unwilling to endorse such a\n\nresult.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Jordan suggests that his third Motion to Proceed Pro Se was\nfiled after the appointment of Pritchard as co-counsel and served\nas de facto notice to the trial court that Jordan preferred self-\nrepresentation to combined representation by Pritchard and\nHamilton. Under all the circumstances, the trial court only could\nhave inferred that the third motion was prepared and mailed prior\nto July 13 when the court acted on Jordan's request that he not be\nrepresented by Hamilton, since the motion arrived at the court on\nJuly 13.\n\n                                  -6-\n\f",
