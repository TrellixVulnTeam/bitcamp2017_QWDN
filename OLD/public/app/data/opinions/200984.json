Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Leslie W. O'Brien, was on brief, for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nH.S. García, United States Attorney, and Sonia I. Torres-Pabón,\nAssistant United States Attorney, Chief, Criminal Division, were on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                                May 4, 2004\n\f             Per Curiam. Defendant-appellant Jerry Martínez-Martí was\n\ncharged with one count of conspiracy to distribute narcotics in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 846 and one count of possession of\n\nfirearms in furtherance of a drug trafficking crime in violation of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1).        Martínez-Martí pleaded guilty to both\n\ncounts and was sentenced to a term of 144 months imprisonment for\n\nthe narcotics violation and 60 months imprisonment for the firearms\n\nviolation, to be served consecutively.      Martínez-Martí appeals the\n\ndistrict court's acceptance of his guilty plea for the firearms\n\npossession charge because, he argues, there was an insufficient\n\nfactual basis for the plea.     We disagree.\n\n             At the plea hearing, the prosecutor submitted that\n\n             [t]he evidence would have shown that [as an\n             enforcer and supervisor of drug distribution],\n             the defendant, Jerry Martínez-Martí would\n             possess firearms and ensure that other members\n             of the conspiracy would possess and use\n             firearms in order to protect itself and the\n             other members of the conspiracy, the drug\n             business, the narcotics themselves, and the\n             proceeds derived from sales of narcotics.\n\nThe   plea   agreement   Martínez-Martí   signed   contained   a   similar\n\ndescription of the nature of the firearms violation.               At the\n\nsentencing hearing, Martínez-Martí informed the district court that\n\n             at no time [has] the U.S. Attorney's Office,\n             nor my attorney, . . . handed me any evidence\n             that directly or indirectly links me with the\n             crime of possessing a firearm, nor of my\n             knowing that others were using firearms . . .\n             [but knowing] that if I am to go to trial\n             . . . I could face a life sentence in prison\n             . . . I make this decision to plead guilty.\n\n                                  -2-\n\f            In response to this statement, the prosecutor informed\n\nthe district court that \"there would have been more than one\n\ncooperating witness that would have testified that throughout the\n\ncourse of this conspiracy, on more than one occasion, that this\n\nDefendant possessed a firearm during the course of his role of that\n\nconspiracy.\"\n\n            The district court then asked Martínez-Martí for his\n\nresponse and Martínez-Martí replied that he agreed with the plea\n\nthat he signed, he assumed responsibility, and he agreed with the\n\nversion of the facts presented by the prosecutor.          The district\n\ncourt then asked Martínez-Martí specifically if \"you admit that you\n\npossessed    weapons   in   connection   with   the   traffic   offense.\"\n\nMartínez-Martí replied \"Well, yes.\"      The district court then found\n\nthat Martínez-Martí's decision to plead guilty was made \"knowingly,\n\nintelligently, voluntarily, and solemnly,\" noting that Martínez-\n\nMartí \"acknowledge[d] the prosecutor's version of the facts\" which\n\nwould have shown guilt beyond a reasonable doubt on both charged\n\ncounts.\n\n            Martínez-Martí now contends that the district court's\n\nacceptance of the guilty plea violated Federal Rule of Criminal\n\nProcedure 11(b)(3) which requires that \"[b]efore entering judgement\n\non a guilty plea, the court must determine that there is a factual\n\nbasis for the plea.\"    Fed. R. Crim. P. 11(b)(3).      Although neither\n\nparty addressed the issue, it is important to note that Rule 11 was\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fsubject to an amendment that took effect on December 1, 2002.\n\nMartínez-Martí's guilty plea and sentence took place in August\n\n2002.    Because his guilty plea was entered prior to the effective\n\ndate of the amendment, the pre-amended Rule 11 applies. See United\n\nStates v. Mercado, 349 F.3d 708, 710 (2d Cir. 2003), cert. denied,\n\n124 S. Ct. 1190 (2004).\n\n            The analogous provision to current Rule 11(b)(3) in the\n\nprior    version   of   Rule   11   is   Rule   11(f),   which   stated   that\n\n\"[n]otwithstanding the acceptance of a plea of guilty, the court\n\nshould not enter a judgment upon such plea without making such\n\ninquiry as shall satisfy it that there is a factual basis for the\n\nplea.\"    See Libretti v. United States, 516 U.S. 29, 38 (1995).\n\n            Martínez-Martí     believes    that   this   rule    was   violated\n\nbecause the information provided to the sentencing judge was too\n\nvague in that it failed to inform the district court when and where\n\nMartínez-Martí was alleged to have a firearm, what he actually did\n\nwith a firearm that furthered the conspiracy, and what type of\n\nfirearm he possessed.\n\n            When a Rule 11 challenge is made for the first time on\n\nappeal, we review for plain error.         United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S.\n\n55, 59 (2002); see also United States v. Mills, 329 F.3d 24, 27\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (stating that \"[an] error not objected to at the\n\nplea hearing is reversible only where the error is plain, affects\n\nthe defendant's substantial rights, and seriously affects the\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\ffairness of the proceeding.\") (citations omitted).                A \"a district\n\njudge satisfies the requirements of Rule 11(f) when he determines\n\nthat the conduct which the defendant admits constitutes the offense\n\ncharged in the indictment or information or an offense included\n\ntherein to which the defendant has pleaded guilty.\"               Libretti, 516\n\nU.S. at 38 (internal quotations and citations omitted).                   \"Often\n\nwhat the judge is told at the hearing is an abbreviated version of\n\nthe full range of government evidence, omitting detail and nuance\n\nthat would be offered at trial.\" United States v. Gandía-Maysonet,\n\n227 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2000).           Rule 11(f)'s requirement -- that\n\nthe trial court be satisfied that a guilty plea has a basis in fact\n\n-- is designed to \"protect a defendant who is in the position of\n\npleading voluntarily with an understanding of the nature of the\n\ncharge but without realizing that his conduct does not actually\n\nfall within the charge.\"            McCarthy v. United States, 394 U.S. 459,\n\n467 (1969) (footnote and internal quotation omitted).\n\n            In   this       case,   Martínez-Martí   questioned    whether      the\n\ngovernment had evidence linking him with the crime of possessing a\n\nfirearm.    In response, the prosecution asserted that they had more\n\nthan one cooperating witnesses who could testify that Martínez-\n\nMartí   possessed       a    firearm    while   executing   his   role   in     the\n\nconspiracy.      After hearing the prosecutor's response, the judge\n\nattempted   to   clarify       whether    Martínez-Martí    admitted     that    he\n\npossessed weapons to further the offenses.              Martínez-Martí again\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fadmitted that he did possess firearms to further the conspiracy.\n\nThis colloquy proves that Martínez-Martí understood the nature of\n\nthe charge against him and realized that his actions fell within\n\nthat charge.    The district court fulfilled its Rule 11(f) duty of\n\n\"making such inquiry as shall satisfy it that there is a factual\n\nbasis for the plea.\"\n\n           As a result, it is not a violation of the former Federal\n\nRule of Criminal Procedure 11(f) for a judge to accept a plea\n\nwhere, as here, the defendant admitted that the facts at trial\n\nwould   have   shown   that   he   possessed   firearms   to   further   the\n\nconspiracy and where, as here, the defendant had an opportunity to\n\nexplain \"in his own words\" whether he admitted to possessing\n\nweapons in connection with the conspiracy.        For the aforementioned\n\nreasons, Martínez-Martí's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f",
