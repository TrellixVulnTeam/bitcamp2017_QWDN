Petitioner Ana Margarita\n\nHernandez-Cabana,1 a native and citizen of Colombia, petitions this\n\ncourt for review of a Board of Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) order\n\naffirming the immigration judge’s (“IJ”) denial of her withholding\n\nof removal claim.      We deny review for reasons stated hereafter.\n\n                                    I.\n\n           Hernandez-Cabana last entered the United States in May\n\n2000, and the government initiated removal proceedings against her\n\nin   January   2004.    She   conceded   removability   but   applied   for\n\nwithholding of removal.2\n\n           Hernandez-Cabana began working as an assistant district\n\nattorney in Colombia in 1997, and she began receiving threatening\n\ntelephone calls in April 1999.       She was told that if she did not\n\nquit her job, harm would come to her and her family.            The calls\n\ncontinued until June 1999, when she resigned and the calls stopped.\n\nShe came to the United States in August 1999 and remained until\n\nFebruary 2000, when she returned to Colombia.       She testified that\n\nshe spent several months in hiding before returning to the United\n\nStates in May 2000.     When she was in Colombia in 2000, either she\n\nor her husband received a threatening phone call.\n\n\n      1\n       Hernandez-Cabana is the lead petitioner.     Hector Enrique\nRomero, her husband, and Angelica Maria Romero Hernandez, her minor\ndaughter, maintain derivative claims.\n      2\n       Hernandez-Cabana also applied for asylum and protection\nunder the Convention Against Torture. Those claims are not before\nus.\n\n                                   -2-\n\f             The     IJ   denied    Hernandez-Cabana’s    withholding      claim,\n\nrelying on Matter of Fuentes, 19 I. & N. Dec. 658, 661 (BIA 1998).\n\nHe   found    that    although      Herndandez-Cabana    was   almost    entirely\n\ncredible, he did not believe her testimony that either she or her\n\nhusband received a threat after her resignation. The BIA summarily\n\naffirmed and adopted the IJ’s decision.\n\n                                        II.\n\n             Where, as here, the BIA summarily affirms the IJ’s\n\ndecision,     we     review   the    IJ’s   decision   directly.     Stroni    v.\n\nGonzales, 454 F.3d 82, 86-87 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing Sulaiman v.\n\nGonzales, 429 F.3d 347, 350 (1st Cir. 2005)).            We “review the BIA’s\n\nadditions to the IJ’s decision directly.”               Id. at 87.      We review\n\nthe IJ’s findings of fact under the substantial evidence standard,\n\nand such findings shall not be overturned unless the record compels\n\nreversal.     Id. (citing Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2004)).      We review conclusions of law de novo, “‘with appropriate\n\ndeference to the agency’s interpretation of the underlying statute\n\nin accordance with administrative law principles.’”                Id. (quoting\n\nGailus v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 43 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n             The Attorney General should withhold the removal of an\n\nalien to a country if “the alien’s life or freedom would be\n\nthreatened in that country because of the alien’s race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.” 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A) (2006). In a withholding claim\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fthe alien must “establish a clear probability of persecution.” Ang\n\nv. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             In Fuentes, the BIA held that “the dangers faced by\n\npolicemen as a result of that status alone are not ones faced on\n\naccount of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or political opinion.”       19 I. & N. Dec. at 661.        The\n\nBIA found that policemen are often attacked because they are\n\n“highly visible embodiments of the power of the state.”           Id.\n\n             Hernandez-Cabana argues her employment as an assistant\n\ndistrict attorney distinguishes this case from Fuentes.                 While\n\nthere may be scenarios where a government official involved in law\n\nenforcement should not be precluded from making an asylum or\n\nwithholding claim, see Abaya v. INS, 2 F. App’x 850, 851 (9th Cir.\n\nJan.   25,   2001)   (unpublished)    (rejecting   a   per   se   rule    of\n\nineligiblity based on Fuentes), this is not such a scenario.\n\n             In this case, Hernandez-Cabana chose to work as an\n\nassistant district attorney, a position that made her a highly\n\nvisible embodiment of the power of Colombia.       See Mediouni v. INS,\n\n314 F.3d 24, 27-28 (1st Cir. 2002).          It was Hernandez-Cabana’s\n\nburden to establish that the threats she received were on account\n\nof one of the five enumerated grounds and not because of the nature\n\nof her employment.    See Ang, 430 F.3d at 58.     However, the evidence\n\nsuggests she received the threats precisely because of her position\n\nas an assistant district attorney.         Accordingly, the record does\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fnot compel the reversal of the IJ’s conclusion that the threats\n\nHernandez-Cabana received were not on account of one of the five\n\nenumerated grounds.     See Stroni, 454 F.3d at 87.\n\n            Further, Hernandez-Cabana does not argue that she is\n\nsubjected   to    persecution   because    of   her   status    as   a   former\n\nprosecutor.      Such an argument could be more compelling than her\n\nargument in this case.     See Mediouni, 314 F.3d at 28 (“In Fuentes,\n\nthe [BIA] held that status as a former policeman is an immutable\n\ncharacteristic, and that mistreatment resulting from such status\n\ncould be found to be persecution on account of political opinion or\n\nmembership in a particular social group.”).            In this case, that\n\nargument would also fail because the record does not support it.\n\nSubstantial evidence supports the IJ’s conclusion that the threats\n\nstopped   after    Hernandez-Cabana      resigned.      Thus,    she     cannot\n\ndemonstrate a clear probability of persecution based on her status\n\nas a former assistant district attorney.\n\n                                  III.\n\n            For the forgoing reasons, we affirm the order of the BIA.\n\nPetitions denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f",
