Sadek Mediouni petitions\n\nfor review of the decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals to\n\ndeny him asylum, withholding of deportation, and relief under the\n\nUnited Nations Convention Against Torture.   While we perceive some\n\nsupport in the record for Mediouni's asylum claim, we cannot say\n\nthat the record compels the conclusion that he demonstrated a well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution.   Accordingly, we affirm the Board's\n\ndenial.\n\n                          I. BACKGROUND\n\n          Mediouni was born in Algeria in 1962. His claims are set\n\nforth against the backdrop of Algeria's struggle against the French\n\ncolonial presence beginning in the 1950s; its independence from\n\nFrance in 1962; the insurrection by Islamic fundamentalists against\n\nthe secular government in the 1980s; and the ensuing civil war that\n\nbegan in 1992.1\n\n          Mediouni's father, a Tunisian-born naturalized French\n\ncitizen and former French military police officer, was stationed in\n\nAlgeria for approximately seventeen years toward the end of the\n\nperiod of French colonial government.        Mediouni's mother was\n\nAlgerian. Until he was an adult, Mediouni was stateless: he lacked\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Mediouni presented documentary evidence and testimony\nconcerning the history of and current conditions in Algeria, which\nthe Board appeared to accept. Neither the Immigration Judge nor\nthe Board impugned his credibility or the accuracy of the\ndocumentary evidence.\n\n                               -2-\n\fAlgerian citizenship, had no identification documents, and was\n\ndenied government services and the ability to travel freely.\n\n           After the end of the war against the French, Mediouni's\n\nfather   fled   Algeria   in   fear   of    his   life,    but   returned   soon\n\nafterward because his wife missed their home.                In 1962, shortly\n\nbefore Mediouni's birth, his father was kidnaped and eventually\n\ndeclared dead.     Mediouni's mother married an Arab Algerian soon\n\nthereafter.\n\n           Until he was nine years old, Mediouni suffered harassment\n\nand threats because he was the son of a French police officer.                At\n\nthat point, his family moved to a different city, where his\n\nbackground was unknown.        There, he did not experience further\n\nharassment or abuse until 1980, when he applied for an identity\n\ncard that he needed to take academic exams.               Following Mediouni's\n\napplication for an identity card, the Algerian government conducted\n\nan investigation of him.          As a result, he received cold and\n\nsuspicious treatment from neighbors and school authorities.\n\n           Although he eventually acquired Algerian citizenship\n\n(through the interventions of a judge who was a relative), over the\n\nnext four years Mediouni was detained and interrogated by the\n\npolice on four separate occasions.            In 1988, he opened a video\n\nrental store.    During the three years that he owned the store, the\n\nAlgerian authorities repeatedly interfered with his business and\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\finvestigated    him   for   distributing   videos   of   \"Anti-Algerian\n\ncontent.\"\n\n            On November 16, 1991,    Mediouni entered the United States\n\nas a visitor for pleasure. He remained in the United States beyond\n\nhis authorization date.     In 1992, civil war erupted in Algeria.   On\n\nJuly 27, 1995, the Immigration and Naturalization Service issued an\n\nOrder to Show Cause charging Mediouni as deportable under former\n\nsection 241(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B)(i) (1995).\n\n            Mediouni conceded that he was deportable as charged, but\n\nsought relief in the form of asylum and withholding of deportation.\n\nHe also sought prevention of deportation under the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture.2     On February 21, 1997, an immigration judge\n\nconducted a hearing, and later denied Mediouni's applications for\n\nrelief and protection.      On April 10, 2002, the Board dismissed his\n\nappeal.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85.\nThe United States ratified the Convention in 1994; in 1998,\nCongress passed legislation to implement the Convention's\nrequirement, contained in article 3, section 1, that \"[n]o\nstate . . . expel, return ('refouler') or extradite a person to\nanother State where there are substantial grounds for believing\nthat he would be in danger of being subjected to torture.\" Foreign\nAffairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 § 2242, Pub. L. No.\n105-277, 112 Stat. 2681-761, 822-23 (1998) (codified at 8 U.S.C. §\n1231 (Supp. V 1999)).\n\n                                    -4-\n\f                              II. DISCUSSION\n\n              We review the Board's findings of fact and credibility\n\nunder a \"substantial evidence\" standard.          Yatskin v. INS, 255 F.3d\n\n5, 9 (1st Cir. 2001); Cordero-Trejo v. INS, 40 F.3d 482, 487 (1st\n\nCir. 1994).       Board determinations of statutory eligibility for\n\nrelief from deportation, whether via asylum or withholding of\n\ndeportation,       are   conclusive    if    \"supported     by   reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.\"      INS v. Elias-Zacharias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992) (quoting\n\n8   U.S.C.    §   1105a(a)(4)).   This      standard   of   review   is   quite\n\ndeferential: we will not reverse unless \"the record evidence would\n\ncompel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.\"\n\nAguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir. 1999); see also\n\nArkansas v. Oklahoma, 503 U.S. 91, 113 (1992) (under general\n\nprinciples of administrative review, we will not \"supplant the\n\nagency's findings merely by identifying alternative findings that\n\ncould be supported by substantial evidence\").               Deference is not\n\ndue, however, if the Board's findings and conclusions are \"based on\n\ninferences or presumptions that are not reasonably grounded in the\n\nrecord, viewed as a whole, or are merely personal views of the\n\nimmigration judge.\"        Cordero-Trejo, 40 F.3d at 487 (internal\n\ncitations omitted).\n\n              We begin with the denial of Mediouni's asylum claim.\n\nBecause the standard for withholding deportation is more stringent\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthan that for asylum, \"a petitioner unable to satisfy the asylum\n\nstandard fails, a fortiori, to satisfy the former.\"          Velasquez v.\n\nAshcroft,    305   F.3d   62,   64    n.2    (1st   Cir.   2002)   (citing\n\nAlvarez-Flores v. INS, 909 F.2d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n            An alien bears the burden of establishing eligibility for\n\nasylum by proving either past persecution or a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution on account of his or her race, religion, nationality,\n\nmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Id.\n\nat 65 (citing 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)).         Mediouni does not assert\n\nthat he suffered past persecution, so we deal only with his\n\ncontention that he demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution\n\nbased on his membership in a particular social group or imputed\n\npolitical opinion.3       Accordingly, he must show both a genuine\n\nsubjective fear and an objectively reasonable fear of persecution\n\non one of those protected grounds.          Id. at 66.\n\n            The Board found that the record did not support the\n\nconclusion that Mediouni reasonably feared persecution because of\n\nhis father's service with the police four decades ago.                 The\n\ndocumentary evidence, it said, indicated that only current members\n\nof security forces \"or those who the terrorists might consider\n\n\n\n     3\n      An imputed political opinion is an opinion attributed to the\nasylum applicant by his or her persecutors. Whether correctly or\nincorrectly attributed, an imputed political opinion \"may\nconstitute a reason for political persecution within the meaning of\nthe Act.\" Vasquez v. INS, 177 F.3d 62, 65 (1st Cir. 1999) (quoting\nRavindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 760 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n                                     -6-\n\ftheir current enemies\" had reason to be fearful. The Board likened\n\nMediouni's fears to those arising from employment in the military\n\nand from \"general conditions of violence and civil unrest,\" neither\n\nof which ordinarily may support a claim of persecution.                  See id.;\n\nMatter of Fuentes, 19 I & N Dec. 658, 661 (BIA 1988).                   The Board\n\nalso   held    that     Mediouni    did    not    satisfy   the   standards   for\n\neligibility for withholding of deportation or for relief under the\n\nConvention Against Torture.\n\n              As   an   initial    matter,       we   believe   that   the   Board\n\ninappropriately analogized Mediouni's claim to \"dangers that arise\n\nfrom employment in the military in areas of domestic unrest.\"\n\nWhile the Board correctly stated that such dangers generally do not\n\nsupport asylum claims, this legal proposition simply does not apply\n\nto Mediouni's circumstances.               Mediouni did not himself choose\n\nemployment in the military or law enforcement, thereby risking\n\nattack as a \"highly visible embodiment[] of the power of the\n\nstate.\"   Fuentes, 19 I & N Dec. at 661.               Rather, he is associated\n\nwith the police solely by virtue of his kinship ties with his\n\nfather, a former officer.          In Fuentes, the Board held          that status\n\nas a former policeman is an immutable characteristic, and that\n\nmistreatment resulting from such status could be found to be\n\npersecution on account of political opinion or membership in a\n\nparticular social group.           Id. at 662.        A similar argument can be\n\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fmade that Mediouni, as the son of a former military police officer,\n\nis not categorically precluded from sustaining an asylum claim.\n\n            Nonetheless,   we    affirm    the     Board's     conclusion    that\n\nMediouni did not adduce sufficiently compelling evidence that his\n\nfear of persecution, based on his kinship with a colonial-era\n\npolice officer, was objectively reasonable. Conceivably, the Board\n\ncould have inferred from the record that family members such as\n\nMediouni are at risk despite the passage of decades.              A 1993 United\n\nStates Department of State report noted that individuals whose\n\nhigh-profile associations with disfavored groups had long since\n\nended had been targeted for attack, including former Marxist Party\n\nofficials and a former national television director.               Three years\n\nlater, the State Department reported that Algerian government\n\nofficials and security service members, as well as their families,\n\nwere attacked.\n\n            Moreover,   Mediouni    points    to    record     evidence     as   to\n\nIslamic fundamentalists'        recent    invocations     of    colonialism      to\n\nfoment anti-French and general xenophobic sentiment.                   The 1996\n\nState Department report also states that \"[t]errorists attacked\n\ncivilians whom they regarded as instruments of the State or whose\n\nlifestyles they considered in conflict with Islamic values.\"\n\n            While this evidence may permit an inference that the son\n\nof   a   deceased   colonial-era   military      police      officer   could     be\n\ntargeted for attack by terrorists, it does not compel it.                 None of\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fthe   evidence   in   the   record   explicitly   addresses   the   present\n\npersecution of family members of police officers dating from the\n\nFrench colonial government.          Mediouni does not fall into any\n\nspecific category of government official or public figure currently\n\nbeing singled out for terrorist attack, nor is he related to such\n\na person.4     Moreover, he has not offered any evidence that his\n\nlifestyle was or would be deemed offensive in the eyes of the\n\nIslamic radicals.     In short, nothing in the record requires us to\n\nsubstitute our judgment for the Board's.          See Aguilar-Solis, 168\n\nF.3d at 569.     Accordingly, we affirm the Board's asylum decision\n\npursuant to the substantial evidence standard of review.5\n\n             The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      His father was not, apparently, a particularly high-level\nformer official comparable to those cited in the 1993 State\nDepartment report.\n      5\n      As Mediouni did not brief his claim under the Convention\nAgainst Torture on appeal, we consider the argument waived. Ortiz\nv. Gaston County Dyeing Machine Co., 277 F.3d 594, 597 (1st Cir.\n2002).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f",

The Board likened Mediouni's fears to those arising from employment in the military and from \"general conditions of violence and civil unrest,\" neither of which ordinarily may support a claim of persecution. <i>See id.; Matter of Fuentes,</i> 19 I &amp; N Dec. 658, 661, 1988 WL 235456 (BIA 1988).

Conceivably, the Board could have inferred from the record that family members such as Mediouni are at risk despite the passage of decades. A 1993 United States Department of State report noted that individuals whose high-profile associations with disfavored groups had long since ended had been targeted for attack, including former Marxist Party officials and a former national television director.

While we perceive some support in the record for Mediouni's asylum claim, we cannot say that the record compels the conclusion that he demonstrated a well-founded fear of persecution. Accordingly, we affirm the Board's denial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>BACKGROUND</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mediouni was born in Algeria in 1962. His claims are set forth against the backdrop of Algeria's struggle against the French colonial presence beginning in the 1950s; its independence from France in 1962; the insurrection by Islamic fundamentalists against the secular government in the 1980s; and the ensuing civil war that began in 1992.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mediouni's father, a Tunisian-born naturalized French citizen and former French military police officer, was stationed in Algeria for approximately seventeen years toward the end of the period of French colonial government. Mediouni's mother was Algerian. Until he was an adult, Mediouni was stateless: he lacked Algerian citizenship, had no identification documents, and was denied government services and the ability to travel freely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the end of the war against the French, Mediouni's father fled Algeria in fear of his life, but returned soon afterward because his wife missed their home. In 1962, shortly before Mediouni's birth, his father was kidnaped and eventually declared dead. Mediouni's mother married an Arab Algerian soon thereafter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Until he was nine years old, Mediouni suffered harassment and threats because he was the son of a French police officer. At that point, his family moved to a different city, where his background was unknown. There, he did not experience further harassment or abuse until 1980, when he applied for an identity card that he needed to take academic exams. Following Mediouni's application for an identity card, the Algerian government conducted an investigation of him. As a result, he received cold and suspicious treatment from neighbors and school authorities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although he eventually acquired Algerian citizenship (through the interventions of a judge who was a relative), over the next four years Mediouni was detained and interrogated by the police on four separate occasions. In 1988, he opened a video rental store. During the three years that he owned the store, the Algerian authorities repeatedly interfered with his business and investigated him for distributing videos of \"Anti-Algerian content.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 16, 1991, Mediouni entered the United States as a visitor for pleasure. He remained in the United States beyond his authorization date. In 1992, civil war erupted in Algeria. On July 27, 1995, the Immigration and Naturalization Service issued an Order to Show Cause charging Mediouni as deportable under former section 241(a)(1)(B) of the Immigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1251(a)(1)(B)(i) (1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mediouni conceded that he was deportable as charged, but sought relief in the form of asylum and withholding of deportation. He also sought prevention of deportation under the Convention Against Torture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On February 21, 1997, an immigration judge conducted a hearing, and later denied Mediouni's applications for relief and protection. On April 10, 2002, the Board dismissed his appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>DISCUSSION</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the Board's findings of fact and credibility under a \"substantial evidence\" standard. <i>Yatskin v.
