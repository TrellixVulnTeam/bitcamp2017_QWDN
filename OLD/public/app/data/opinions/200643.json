Marianne B. Bowler, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                    Baldock,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                      and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     David F. Grunebaum with whom Holtz Gilman Grunebaum and Monica\nE. Conyngham, City Solicitor, City of Quincy, were on brief for\nappellant City of Quincy.\n     Kathleen E. Bandera pro se.\n\n\n                           September 12, 2003\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.    This is an appeal by the City of\n\nQuincy from a jury verdict against the city in favor of Kathleen\n\nBandera. The jury awarded Bandera $135,000 in punitive damages for\n\nsexual harassment, seemingly under state law.    The appeal presents\n\ntwo different issues–-whether the claim was barred by a prior\n\npurported settlement agreement and whether the trial was infected\n\nby error.    The background facts follow.\n\n            In September 1997, Bandera was hired by the City of\n\nQuincy as executive director of a newly established, or to be\n\nestablished, Community Policing Commission.        In the role she\n\nreported to then-Mayor James Sheets and Police Chief Thomas Frane.\n\nAccording to testimony at the later trial, both men warned her that\n\nshe would encounter difficulties in her new post both as a woman\n\nand as a civilian.\n\n            Bandera testified at trial that she was subject to\n\ndiscriminatory treatment during her brief tenure as director: that\n\nshe was excluded from meetings, ridiculed, and subjected by male\n\nofficers to graphic details of their sexual exploits. Further, she\n\nsaid, Sheets and Frane failed to take steps to halt this harassment\n\nalthough they were advised of at least some of Bandera's concerns.\n\nShe told the jury that in early June 1998 Frane asked Sheets to\n\nreplace her with a male police officer.     On June 9, 1998, Bandera\n\nwas terminated effective at the end of the month.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f           Bandera responded by suing the city, Frane, and Sheets in\n\nthe federal district court, alleging gender discrimination of two\n\nkinds: sexual harassment and wrongful termination. Her claims were\n\nbased on two federal statutes--Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n\n1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e (2000), and Section 1983, 28 U.S.C. § 1983\n\n(2000)–-and on the Massachusetts Fair Employment Practices Act,\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B (2000).          After initial discovery, the\n\ndistrict court in September 2001 scheduled trial for November 13,\n\n2001.\n\n           The parties then conferred over two days at the end of\n\nOctober 2001 (October 29 and 30) with a mediator.        This resulted in\n\na   handwritten   agreement,   dated    October   30,   2001,   and   signed\n\nseparately by counsel for the defendants, by counsel for Bandera,\n\nand by Bandera herself.    The text of the \"Memorandum of Agreement\"\n\nis as follows:\n\n           1. The parties will enter a Stipulation of\n           dismissal with prejudice, and without costs.\n\n           2. The City will pay $21,300 to \"Wendy Kaplan,\n           Esq., as Attorney for Kathleen Bandera.\" The\n           City will issue a 1099 for this amount to\n           Wendy Kaplan, Esq.\n\n           3. The City will cause the Quincy School\n           Committee to issue an employment contract to\n           Kathleen Bandera for a position in the Quincy\n           Public Schools as a permanent substitute for\n           the balance of the 2001-2002 school year.\n\n           4. If Bandera is not hired by the Quincy\n           Public Schools for a permanent teaching\n           position on or before the start of the 2002-\n           2003 school year, Mayor Sheets will recommend\n\n                                  -3-\n\f           to the Superintendent that Bandera be offered\n           a contract as a permanent substitute for the\n           2002-2003 school year. If the Superintendent\n           declines to offer the contract because of lack\n           of funds, the Mayor will take all necessary\n           steps to attain sufficient funding.\n\n           5. The parties will execute a general release\n           of all claims asserted or unasserted and a\n           comprehensive settlement document which shall\n           include   non-admission  and   non-disclosure\n           provisions.\n\n           6. Both the facts of an agreement, and the\n           terms of this agreement, shall not be\n           disclosed, except to the U.S. District Court\n           prior to November 13, 2001.\n\n           7.   This  settlement,  and   the  terms   of\n           settlement, shall not be deemed or construed\n           as an admission or finding of a violation of\n           any law, policy, custom, or procedure, and\n           shall not be introduced as evidence of such a\n           violation in any other proceeding.\n\n             8. David Grunebaum has the authority to sign\n             for the defendants.\n\n             At some point in early November 2001, Bandera herself\n\napparently called defendants' counsel to disavow the settlement\n\nagreement and she thereafter refused to sign a typewritten version\n\nof the agreement and consonant release.             In the election held on\n\nNovember 6, 2001, Sheets was defeated by another candidate.                  On\n\nNovember   13,   2001,   Bandera's     own    counsel   filed   a   motion   to\n\nwithdraw. On November 19, 2001, the parties appeared before the\n\ndistrict court     and   the   city   moved    to   enforce   the   settlement\n\nagreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           Bandera responded that she had been coerced into the\n\nsettlement by her attorney's alleged threats (e.g., that Bandera\n\nmight be held in contempt).        Further, Bandera said that there had\n\nbeen at the time of the written agreement an oral agreement between\n\nboth attorneys and Bandera that–-if Bandera signed and remained\n\nsilent   until   the    election–-the        agreement   would      be    redrafted\n\nafterwards to address Bandera's concerns and that if Mayor Sheets\n\nwere not re-elected, the agreement would be null and void.\n\n           The district court then gave Bandera 30 days to retain\n\nnew   counsel.     In   December   2001,      incident    to   her       request    to\n\nwithdraw, Bandera's counsel made filings including an affidavit\n\ndisputing in general terms Bandera's version of what had occurred\n\nat the mediation and settlement and countering certain of Bandera's\n\nspecific allegations.       Her counsel did not say one way or the other\n\nwhat she had said to Bandera incident to the signing but did say\n\nthat the terms of the agreement had originally been proposed by\n\nBandera herself.\n\n           At a status conference on January 4, 2002, Bandera–-now\n\nrepresenting     herself--objected      to     the   motion    to    enforce       the\n\nsettlement     agreement,     saying    that     the     agreement        was   only\n\npreliminary and that Sheets was no longer mayor.                     The district\n\njudge told Bandera that the city would still have to follow through\n\nwith its commitment but Bandera said that she wanted to get out of\n\nthe settlement agreement and to proceed with a new attorney.                       The\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fdefendants repeated that they had a valid settlement. The district\n\njudge then stated:\n\n          That [referring to the signed Memorandum of\n          Agreement] is going to lead to another trial,\n          whether she, you know, whether she intended to\n          do it or she didn't intend to do it.\n\n                 What I am going to do is -- I think the\n          case should be settled. This is America. If\n          she wants to try her case, she can try it. I\n          am going to give her a trial date three months\n          from now. Give her a date. No continuances.\n          If you don't get a lawyer, you are going to\n          have to try the case yourself.\n\nResponding to a further objection from the defendants, the court\n\nresponded, \"just for the record, I am going to deny the request to\n\nenforce the settlement agreement.\"\n\n          On January 7, 2002, the district court issued a written\n\ndecision denying defendants' motion to enforce the settlement. The\n\ndistrict court noted that the parties signed only the \"Memorandum\n\nof Agreement\" anticipating a final comprehensive agreement, and\n\nnever signed the final agreement, and continued:\n\n          \"As a general rule, a trial court may not\n          summarily enforce a settlement agreement if\n          there is a genuinely disputed question of\n          material fact regarding the existence or terms\n          of that agreement\" [quoting Malave v. Carney\n          Hosp., 170 F.3d 217, 220 (1st Cir. 1999)]. In\n          this case, the Parties disagree about the\n          significance    of    the    \"Memorandum    of\n          Settlement.\"   Defendants' Motion, therefore,\n          is DENIED.\n\n          The defendants filed a motion for reconsideration seeking\n\nenforcement of the settlement agreement or at least an evidentiary\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fhearing.     Following the denial of both requests, the defendants\n\nsought to appeal to this court from the refusal to enforce the\n\nsettlement agreement but the appeal was dismissed for lack of a\n\nfinal appealable order.          In due course, the case was set for trial\n\nbefore a magistrate judge on the consent of both parties.                           28\n\nU.S.C. § 636(c) (2000); Fed. R. Civ. P. 73.               At the ensuing trial\n\nBandera represented herself.\n\n           At   trial,     Bandera     testified     in    detail       as   to    her\n\nexperience    and    sought      compensatory    front    and    back     pay     but–-\n\napparently to avoid further discovery and delay–-made no claim for\n\nemotional suffering.       She also adduced testimony from a number of\n\nwitnesses including Nancy Coletta, a female police officer in the\n\nQuincy Police Department.            Coletta, who had filed then-pending\n\nsexual harassment claims of her own against the police department,\n\ngave damaging testimony, more fully described below, as to her own\n\nexperience and her view of Bandera's treatment.\n\n             The defense offered testimony from several witnesses\n\nincluding Frane and two other police officials.                 After two days of\n\ndeliberation,       the   jury    returned   a    set     of    special      verdicts\n\naddressing, as to each defendant, each theory of recovery urged\n\nagainst that defendant (not every theory was directed against each\n\ndefendant).     The jury rejected all claims made against the mayor\n\nand police chief and all claims against the city save for the\n\nsexual harassment claims made under Title VII and Chapter 151B.\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fThe jury also ruled that Bandera had proved no damages as to front\n\nor back pay but was entitled to $135,000 in punitive damages.1\n\n           On this appeal, the city argues-–as one would expect–-\n\nfirst that the settlement agreement foreclosed Bandera's claims\n\nand, alternatively, that the district court could not refuse\n\nenforcement     of    the   agreement      without     holding      an     evidentiary\n\nhearing.   On    the      facts    of     record,     the    latter       position     is\n\npresumptively        correct,     although      the   issue    is     a    shade     more\n\ncomplicated than the city suggests.                   At the very least, the\n\ndistrict court has not yet supplied an adequate reason for refusing\n\nto enforce the agreement.\n\n           A formal release would have barred Bandera's claims\n\nwithout more, Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 284 (1981), but\n\nBandera's release could be secured only by enforcement of the\n\nsettlement agreement.        Yet it is conventional for the court before\n\nwhom the   case      is   pending    to    enforce     a    settlement      agreement,\n\nassuming it is valid, Quint v. A.E. Staley Mfg. Co., 246 F.3d 11,\n\n14 (1st Cir. 2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 1023 (2002); it would\n\ngenerally be preposterous to conduct a trial in the teeth of a\n\n\n     1\n      In response to post-trial motions by the city, the district\ncourt ruled that–given the instructions–the award of punitive\ndamages given in the absence of compensatory damages had implicitly\nbeen premised on Chapter 151B which (the court held) permits such\nan award. Bandera v. City of Quincy, 220 F. Supp. 2d 26, 29-31 (D.\nMass. 2002). Compare Kerr-Selgas v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 69 F.3d\n1205, 1214-15 (1st Cir. 1995); see also Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy,\nDiv. of Melville Corp., 145 F.3d 5, 11 (1st Cir. 1998). No appeal\nas to this ruling has been taken.\n\n                                          -8-\n\fvalid settlement agreement and award damages–only to have the\n\nresulting judgment unwound by a contract action or similar remedy\n\nimplementing the settlement agreement.\n\n           Does a judge nevertheless have residual authority to\n\nrefuse to enforce a settlement agreement that is otherwise a valid\n\ncontract? It is hard to foresee all possible circumstances, but of\n\nthis we are sure: a judge cannot refuse to enforce an otherwise\n\nvalid settlement agreement on the ground initially given in this\n\ncase, namely, that doing so would require the judge to conduct a\n\nmini-trial into the question whether a binding contract had been\n\nmade.   Contract enforcement is not normally a matter of judicial\n\nconvenience.\n\n          The district judge was moved by Bandera's desire to have\n\nher day in court.   But settlement agreements, if valid and not\n\nagainst public policy, are voluntary surrenders of the right to\n\nhave one's day in court. Conceivably, a settlement agreement might\n\n(rarely) be invalid as against public policy, e.g., EEOC v. Astra\n\nUSA, Inc., 94 F.3d 738, 744-45 (1st Cir. 1996), but there is no\n\nevident public policy objection to the settlement of Bandera's\n\nclaim--if the contract is a valid one.   Nor, on this assumption, is\n\nthere any evident equitable reason to deny specific performance of\n\nthe contract.\n\n          This brings us to the issue of validity.     The district\n\ncourt was assuredly correct in saying that in general \"'a trial\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fcourt    may    not   summarily     enforce     a     settlement    agreement'\"       if\n\nmaterial facts are in dispute as to the validity or terms of the\n\nagreement, Malave v. Carney Hosp., 170 F.3d 217, 220 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).    But by the same token the district court cannot summarily\n\ndeny enforcement simply because material facts are in dispute: the\n\ntask is to resolve the dispute.                 And, in this instance, it is\n\nunlikely–-though perhaps not impossible--that the matter could be\n\nresolved without an evidentiary hearing.\n\n               The two most obvious issues of fact are whether–-as\n\nBandera    claims–-she       was    improperly        coerced    into   signing       the\n\nagreement       and   whether–-as        she     also     claims–-there         was     a\n\ncontemporaneous       side    agreement        that     the     contract   would       be\n\nrenegotiated in her favor after the election.                      Of course, such\n\nissues are surrounded by legal questions (e.g., when can a party\n\nclaim coercion by her own attorney as a defense vis-à-vis a third\n\nparty; does the parol evidence rule bar the showing of a side\n\nagreement); but one might need more facts, as well as briefing,\n\neven to address such issues.\n\n               Further, although Bandera's asserted subjective beliefs\n\nregarding the settlement likely do not bar enforcement (absent\n\ncoercion or a valid side agreement), conceivably she might argue\n\nthat some of the terms of the agreement are too indefinite to\n\nsupport a valid agreement or that Sheets' defeat in the election\n\nfrustrated      the   purpose      of   the    agreement.        Neither   of    these\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\farguments seems especially promising but both have been hinted at.\n\nThat the signed document contemplated a second more complete\n\nwritten       agreement     would    not     by   itself   automatically      preclude\n\ntreating the former as a binding contract.2\n\n               This brings us to the defendants' second attack on the\n\njudgment which concerns alleged errors at trial.                   We address these\n\nclaims now for a very obvious reason: although they would be mooted\n\nby a decision upholding the settlement agreement, the possibility\n\nexists that the settlement agreement will not prove a valid bar to\n\nthe judgment.          If so, it would be time wasting to have a second\n\nappeal to consider claims of trial error which are at this time\n\nfully briefed and equally legitimate challenges to the judgment.\n\n               Both of the claims of trial error center around the\n\ntestimony of Nancy Coletta, the City of Quincy police officer\n\ncalled by Bandera.          Prior to trial, when Coletta was identified as\n\na witness for Bandera, defendants anticipated that Coletta among\n\nothers would be asked to describe her own experiences with the\n\npolice and thus moved in limine for an order limiting or excluding\n\nsuch       testimony   on   the     ground    that   it    was   irrelevant    or,   if\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      An agreement to make a further more detailed agreement could\nin some instances not be intended as a binding contract, or might\nbe too indefinite; but neither is necessarily or even ordinarily\nso. Bacou Dalloz USA v. Continental Polymers, Inc., __ F.3d __\n(1st Cir. 2003); Ysiem Corp. v. Commercial Net Lease Realty, Inc.,\n328 F.32 20, 23 (1st Cir. 2003); Quint, 246 F.3d at 15; Farnsworth\non Contracts § 3.8 (2d ed. 1998).\n\n                                           -11-\n\frelevant, unduly prejudicial under Federal Rule of Evidence 403.\n\nThe district judge denied the motion without discussion.\n\n            At trial Coletta gave testimony of two different types.\n\nPrimarily, she described the harassment to which she herself had\n\nbeen subject; these episodes included name-calling, exposure to\n\noffensive conversations about sexual matters and to pornographic\n\nmagazines, hostile treatment, and her reporting of these incidents\n\nto Frane.    She testified that she had suffered major depression as\n\na result of this behavior.\n\n            In   addition,     Coletta   was   allowed   to   testify   over\n\nobjections by the defense as to how Coletta felt about, and\n\nassessed,    Bandera's   own    allegations.     In   particular,   Coletta\n\ntestified:\n\n            • that after reading about Bandera's claims\n              she (Coletta) had told another officer \"how\n              I felt that it was unfair and how I didn't\n              feel that they were giving you [Bandera] a\n              chance to show your potential, just like\n              they hadn't done to me. And that it's the\n              old-boy network\";\n\n             • that she (Coletta) had told another officer\n               that she thought that Bandera's \"potential\n               had been squashed by the men in the\n               department\"; and\n\n             • that she had told Bandera that she (Coletta)\n               had been placed on administrative leave due\n               to job stress and told her further that\n               Bandera \"had suffered from the same stuff .\n               . . .\"\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f            On appeal, the city says that Coletta's testimony was of\n\nminimal relevance but highly prejudicial, see Fed. R. Evid. 403,\n\nthat Coletta had no first hand knowledge of what happened to\n\nBandera and her views constituted inappropriate opinion testimony\n\nby a lay witness, Fed. R. Evid. 701, and that the testimony as to\n\nwhat Coletta said to other officers or Bandera was inadmissible\n\nhearsay, Fed. R. Evid. 801.          We consider separately the two phases\n\nof Coletta's testimony.\n\n            Coletta's recitation of her own experiences was relevant.\n\nThe most obvious relevance of Coletta's testimony–that she had\n\nsuffered similar harassment and reported it to Frane–was to show\n\nliability on the part of supervisory officers such as Frane and\n\nalso on the city for a pattern of knowing toleration of harassment\n\nby   its    subordinates.          See,    e.g.,    Hirase-Doi     v.    U.S.    West\n\nCommunications,      Inc.,    61    F.3d    777,   782-84    (10th      Cir.   1995).\n\nWhether it might also be relevant for other purposes does not\n\nmatter here, and we take no position on the issue.                   Compare id..\n\n            How far Coletta's testimony tended to achieve these ends\n\nin the present case might or might not be debatable but it is\n\nsimply not discussed by defendants.                 They make only a generic\n\nobjection     that    the    experience      of    other    female      officers   is\n\ninherently remote and, where (as here) graphic, inherently more\n\nprejudicial    than    probative.          We    assume    that   such    a    generic\n\nobjection is properly preserved, having been made and ruled on at\n\n\n                                          -13-\n\fpretrial, Crowe v. Bolduc, 334 F.3d 124, 133 (1st Cir. 2003); but\n\nexpressed in abstract terms–which is all we have–it is unsound and\n\nwas properly rejected.\n\n          Coletta's testimony as to her own assessment of Bandera's\n\nexperience     is   quite     a   different      matter.    In   form    it     was\n\nhearsay–testimony of what the witness said to another outside of\n\ncourt   and    offered      for   the    truth    of    those    out    of    court\n\nstatements–but that is not its main vice.              Coletta, after all, was\n\nthere to be examined; and her statements would have had about the\n\nsame force if she had simply given her naked present assessment of\n\nBandera's situation instead of describing her earlier, out of court\n\nassessments.\n\n             The real problem is that, so far as it appears, Coletta\n\nhad no actual knowledge of what had happened to Bandera, and her\n\nassessments of what Bandera reported to have happened and the\n\npsychological impact on Bandera were wholly inappropriate opinion\n\ntestimony. Fed. R. Evid. 701; Lynch v. City of Boston, 180 F.3d 1,\n\n16-17 (1st Cir. 1999).        Coletta was not qualified as an expert on\n\nanything and her assessments were not the limited kind of opinion\n\ntestimony deemed helpful to a jury (e.g., an estimate of car speed\n\nor whether a defendant was intoxicated) but simply jury argument\n\noffered from the witness stand. The testimony should certainly not\n\nhave been admitted.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\f           If the basic objection–improper opinion testimony by a\n\nlay witness–had been preserved, we might be tempted to reverse.\n\nQuite possibly this phase of the testimony had fairly limited\n\nimpact:   Coletta's assessment of Bandera's situation was nothing\n\nlike so graphic as Coletta's admissible testimony as to her own\n\nexperience; her opinions as to Bandera's experience were mildly\n\nphrased; and the jury was far more likely to base its judgment on\n\nBandera's own detailed recitation of what had happened to her.\n\nStill, whether the testimony's admission could be described safely\n\nas harmless error is open to doubt.\n\n           But the objection was not in our view properly preserved.\n\nAdmittedly, the newly amended Federal Rules of Evidence sensibly\n\nprovide that an objection resolved by a definitive in limine ruling\n\nadmitting evidence need not be renewed at trial. F. R. Evid. 103(a)\n\n(2000).   But if the district judge ruled definitively on anything,\n\nit was that Coletta and similar witnesses could testify about their\n\nown experience and not that they could assess that of Bandera. This\n\nis evident from the in limine motion itself.\n\n           Then at trial when the opinion testimony was offered,\n\ndefense counsel said \"objection\" on several occasions; but few of\n\nthe objections were explained and the ones that were had to do with\n\ntime frame.   Given earlier general attacks on Coletta's testimony\n\nbased on relevance and prejudice, we do not think that it was at\n\nall necessarily obvious to the magistrate judge that the new\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fobjections were to impermissible lay witness opinion.      This is\n\nespecially so because several of the objections were specifically\n\nabout time frame.\n\n          The law is clear that an objection, if its basis is not\n\nobvious, is not preserved unless the ground is stated. Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 103(a)(1); United States v. Carrillo-Figueroa, 34 F.3d 33, 39\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).    This case is a perfect illustration of why that\n\nrule is a sound one. Coletta's opinion testimony, although clearly\n\ninappropriate, was at the tag end of other testimony to which\n\ndifferent objections had been litigated pretrial.   If counsel had\n\nexplained why this new testimony differed and was in no way covered\n\nby the district court's in limine ruling, there is a good chance\n\nthat the magistrate judge would have excluded it. See Freeman v.\n\nPackage Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1337-38 (1st Cir. 1988).3\n\n          This is not a criticism of counsel.   Trials are a rough\n\nand ready business; snap judgments as to unexpected testimony have\n\nto be made all the time. However, the failure to preserve the\n\nobjection means review is at most for plain error. Fed. R.    Evid.\n\n\n     3\n      Although the point is not mentioned by defendants, the\nmagistrate judge may have borne some of the responsibility for this\nomission because she told the lawyers that in general they should\nsimply object and she would hold a bench conference if the basis\nfor the objection was unclear.      This may have been an unwise\ndirection, United States v. Gomes, 177 F.3d 76, 80 (1st Cir. 1999),\nbut in any case she readily allowed counsel to approach the bench\nto spell out objections and defense counsel could easily have\nexplained at the bench how the opinion testimony differed from\nColetta's prior testimony about her own experience and why it was\nobjectionable. Id.\n\n                                -16-\n\f103(d).     As we have noted, it is far from clear that the opinion\n\ntestimony was harmful.           This doubt alone is enough to bar reversal\n\nunder the plain error doctrine: although the error is plain in\n\nretrospect, there is no showing that it probably infected the\n\noutcome or caused a miscarriage of justice.                        United States v.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. 725, 736 (1993); Danco, Inc. v. Wal-Mart Stores,\n\nInc., 178 F.3d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            To sum up, the judgment must be set aside by the district\n\ncourt if in further proceedings it is determined that a valid\n\nsettlement    agreement        was   established          requiring    a    release    of\n\nBandera's    claims       in   exchange      for    what     was   promised      in   the\n\nagreement.     But if the settlement agreement proves in further\n\nproceedings not to be a bar, then the judgment stands.                                The\n\nprospect of such further proceedings and a further appeal from\n\ntheir outcome might suggest that compromise of some kind remains in\n\nthe parties' best interests.\n\n              The judgment of the district court is stayed pending\n\nfurther   order      of    the    district        court    following       the   further\n\nproceedings    now    ordered,       and    this    matter    is   remanded to        the\n\ndistrict court for proceedings consistent with this decision.\n\n             It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -17-\n\f",

This is an appeal by the City of\n\nQuincy from a jury verdict against the city in favor of Kathleen\n\nBandera. The jury awarded Bandera $135,000 in punitive damages for\n\nsexual harassment, seemingly under state law.    The appeal presents\n\ntwo different issues–-whether the claim was barred by a prior\n\npurported settlement agreement and whether the trial was infected\n\nby error.    The background facts follow.\n\n            In September 1997, Bandera was hired by the City of\n\nQuincy as executive director of a newly established, or to be\n\nestablished, Community Policing Commission.        In the role she\n\nreported to then-Mayor James Sheets and Police Chief Thomas Frane.\n\nAccording to testimony at the later trial, both men warned her that\n\nshe would encounter difficulties in her new post both as a woman\n\nand as a civilian.\n\n            Bandera testified at trial that she was subject to\n\ndiscriminatory treatment during her brief tenure as director: that\n\nshe was excluded from meetings, ridiculed, and subjected by male\n\nofficers to graphic details of their sexual exploits. Further, she\n\nsaid, Sheets and Frane failed to take steps to halt this harassment\n\nalthough they were advised of at least some of Bandera's concerns.\n\nShe told the jury that in early June 1998 Frane asked Sheets to\n\nreplace her with a male police officer.     On June 9, 1998, Bandera\n\nwas terminated effective at the end of the month.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f           Bandera responded by suing the city, Frane, and Sheets in\n\nthe federal district court, alleging gender discrimination of two\n\nkinds: sexual harassment and wrongful termination. Her claims were\n\nbased on two federal statutes--Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n\n1964, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e (2000), and Section 1983, 28 U.S.C. § 1983\n\n(2000)–-and on the Massachusetts Fair Employment Practices Act,\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 151B (2000).          After initial discovery, the\n\ndistrict court in September 2001 scheduled trial for November 13,\n\n2001.\n\n           The parties then conferred over two days at the end of\n\nOctober 2001 (October 29 and 30) with a mediator.        This resulted in\n\na   handwritten   agreement,   dated    October   30,   2001,   and   signed\n\nseparately by counsel for the defendants, by counsel for Bandera,\n\nand by Bandera herself.    The text of the \"Memorandum of Agreement\"\n\nis as follows:\n\n           1. The parties will enter a Stipulation of\n           dismissal with prejudice, and without costs.\n\n           2. The City will pay $21,300 to \"Wendy Kaplan,\n           Esq., as Attorney for Kathleen Bandera.\" The\n           City will issue a 1099 for this amount to\n           Wendy Kaplan, Esq.\n\n           3. The City will cause the Quincy School\n           Committee to issue an employment contract to\n           Kathleen Bandera for a position in the Quincy\n           Public Schools as a permanent substitute for\n           the balance of the 2001-2002 school year.\n\n           4. If Bandera is not hired by the Quincy\n           Public Schools for a permanent teaching\n           position on or before the start of the 2002-\n           2003 school year, Mayor Sheets will recommend\n\n                                  -3-\n\f           to the Superintendent that Bandera be offered\n           a contract as a permanent substitute for the\n           2002-2003 school year. If the Superintendent\n           declines to offer the contract because of lack\n           of funds, the Mayor will take all necessary\n           steps to attain sufficient funding.\n\n           5. The parties will execute a general release\n           of all claims asserted or unasserted and a\n           comprehensive settlement document which shall\n           include   non-admission  and   non-disclosure\n           provisions.\n\n           6. Both the facts of an agreement, and the\n           terms of this agreement, shall not be\n           disclosed, except to the U.S. District Court\n           prior to November 13, 2001.\n\n           7.   This  settlement,  and   the  terms   of\n           settlement, shall not be deemed or construed\n           as an admission or finding of a violation of\n           any law, policy, custom, or procedure, and\n           shall not be introduced as evidence of such a\n           violation in any other proceeding.\n\n             8. David Grunebaum has the authority to sign\n             for the defendants.\n\n             At some point in early November 2001, Bandera herself\n\napparently called defendants' counsel to disavow the settlement\n\nagreement and she thereafter refused to sign a typewritten version\n\nof the agreement and consonant release.             In the election held on\n\nNovember 6, 2001, Sheets was defeated by another candidate.                  On\n\nNovember   13,   2001,   Bandera's     own    counsel   filed   a   motion   to\n\nwithdraw. On November 19, 2001, the parties appeared before the\n\ndistrict court     and   the   city   moved    to   enforce   the   settlement\n\nagreement.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           Bandera responded that she had been coerced into the\n\nsettlement by her attorney's alleged threats (e.g., that Bandera\n\nmight be held in contempt).        Further, Bandera said that there had\n\nbeen at the time of the written agreement an oral agreement between\n\nboth attorneys and Bandera that–-if Bandera signed and remained\n\nsilent   until   the    election–-the        agreement   would      be    redrafted\n\nafterwards to address Bandera's concerns and that if Mayor Sheets\n\nwere not re-elected, the agreement would be null and void.\n\n           The district court then gave Bandera 30 days to retain\n\nnew   counsel.     In   December   2001,      incident    to   her       request    to\n\nwithdraw, Bandera's counsel made filings including an affidavit\n\ndisputing in general terms Bandera's version of what had occurred\n\nat the mediation and settlement and countering certain of Bandera's\n\nspecific allegations.       Her counsel did not say one way or the other\n\nwhat she had said to Bandera incident to the signing but did say\n\nthat the terms of the agreement had originally been proposed by\n\nBandera herself.\n\n           At a status conference on January 4, 2002, Bandera–-now\n\nrepresenting     herself--objected      to     the   motion    to    enforce       the\n\nsettlement     agreement,     saying    that     the     agreement        was   only\n\npreliminary and that Sheets was no longer mayor.                     The district\n\njudge told Bandera that the city would still have to follow through\n\nwith its commitment but Bandera said that she wanted to get out of\n\nthe settlement agreement and to proceed with a new attorney.                       The\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\fdefendants repeated that they had a valid settlement. The district\n\njudge then stated:\n\n          That [referring to the signed Memorandum of\n          Agreement] is going to lead to another trial,\n          whether she, you know, whether she intended to\n          do it or she didn't intend to do it.\n\n                 What I am going to do is -- I think the\n          case should be settled. This is America. If\n          she wants to try her case, she can try it. I\n          am going to give her a trial date three months\n          from now. Give her a date. No continuances.\n          If you don't get a lawyer, you are going to\n          have to try the case yourself.\n\nResponding to a further objection from the defendants, the court\n\nresponded, \"just for the record, I am going to deny the request to\n\nenforce the settlement agreement.\"\n\n          On January 7, 2002, the district court issued a written\n\ndecision denying defendants' motion to enforce the settlement. The\n\ndistrict court noted that the parties signed only the \"Memorandum\n\nof Agreement\" anticipating a final comprehensive agreement, and\n\nnever signed the final agreement, and continued:\n\n          \"As a general rule, a trial court may not\n          summarily enforce a settlement agreement if\n          there is a genuinely disputed question of\n          material fact regarding the existence or terms\n          of that agreement\" [quoting Malave v. Carney\n          Hosp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198366\"><a href=\"/opinion/198366/malave-v-carney-hospital/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">217</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 220 (1st Cir. 1999)]. In\n          this case, the Parties disagree about the\n          significance    of    the    \"Memorandum    of\n          Settlement.\"   Defendants' Motion, therefore,\n          is DENIED.\n\n          The defendants filed a motion for reconsideration seeking\n\nenforcement of the settlement agreement or at least an evidentiary\n\n\n                               -6-\n\fhearing.     Following the denial of both requests, the defendants\n\nsought to appeal to this court from the refusal to enforce the\n\nsettlement agreement but the appeal was dismissed for lack of a\n\nfinal appealable order.          In due course, the case was set for trial\n\nbefore a magistrate judge on the consent of both parties.                           28\n\nU.S.C. § 636(c) (2000); Fed. R. Civ. P. 73.               At the ensuing trial\n\nBandera represented herself.\n\n           At   trial,     Bandera     testified     in    detail       as   to    her\n\nexperience    and    sought      compensatory    front    and    back     pay     but–-\n\napparently to avoid further discovery and delay–-made no claim for\n\nemotional suffering.       She also adduced testimony from a number of\n\nwitnesses including Nancy Coletta, a female police officer in the\n\nQuincy Police Department.            Coletta, who had filed then-pending\n\nsexual harassment claims of her own against the police department,\n\ngave damaging testimony, more fully described below, as to her own\n\nexperience and her view of Bandera's treatment.\n\n             The defense offered testimony from several witnesses\n\nincluding Frane and two other police officials.                 After two days of\n\ndeliberation,       the   jury    returned   a    set     of    special      verdicts\n\naddressing, as to each defendant, each theory of recovery urged\n\nagainst that defendant (not every theory was directed against each\n\ndefendant).     The jury rejected all claims made against the mayor\n\nand police chief and all claims against the city save for the\n\nsexual harassment claims made under Title VII and Chapter 151B.\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fThe jury also ruled that Bandera had proved no damages as to front\n\nor back pay but was entitled to $135,000 in punitive damages.1\n\n           On this appeal, the city argues-–as one would expect–-\n\nfirst that the settlement agreement foreclosed Bandera's claims\n\nand, alternatively, that the district court could not refuse\n\nenforcement     of    the   agreement      without     holding      an     evidentiary\n\nhearing.   On    the      facts    of     record,     the    latter       position     is\n\npresumptively        correct,     although      the   issue    is     a    shade     more\n\ncomplicated than the city suggests.                   At the very least, the\n\ndistrict court has not yet supplied an adequate reason for refusing\n\nto enforce the agreement.\n\n           A formal release would have barred Bandera's claims\n\nwithout more, Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 284 (1981), but\n\nBandera's release could be secured only by enforcement of the\n\nsettlement agreement.        Yet it is conventional for the court before\n\nwhom the   case      is   pending    to    enforce     a    settlement      agreement,\n\nassuming it is valid, Quint v. A.E. Staley Mfg.

It is hard to foresee all possible circumstances, but of\n\nthis we are sure: a judge cannot refuse to enforce an otherwise\n\nvalid settlement agreement on the ground initially given in this\n\ncase, namely, that doing so would require the judge to conduct a\n\nmini-trial into the question whether a binding contract had been\n\nmade.   Contract enforcement is not normally a matter of judicial\n\nconvenience.\n\n          The district judge was moved by Bandera's desire to have\n\nher day in court.   But settlement agreements, if valid and not\n\nagainst public policy, are voluntary surrenders of the right to\n\nhave one's day in court. Conceivably, a settlement agreement might\n\n(rarely) be invalid as against public policy, e.g., EEOC v. Astra\n\nUSA, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196971\"><a href=\"/opinion/196971/eeoc-v-astra-usa-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 744-45 (1st Cir. 1996), but there is no\n\nevident public policy objection to the settlement of Bandera's\n\nclaim--if the contract is a valid one.   Nor, on this assumption, is\n\nthere any evident equitable reason to deny specific performance of\n\nthe contract.\n\n          This brings us to the issue of validity.     The district\n\ncourt was assuredly correct in saying that in general \"'a trial\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fcourt    may    not   summarily     enforce     a     settlement    agreement'\"       if\n\nmaterial facts are in dispute as to the validity or terms of the\n\nagreement, Malave v.

But by the same token the district court cannot summarily\n\ndeny enforcement simply because material facts are in dispute: the\n\ntask is to resolve the dispute.                 And, in this instance, it is\n\nunlikely–-though perhaps not impossible--that the matter could be\n\nresolved without an evidentiary hearing.\n\n               The two most obvious issues of fact are whether–-as\n\nBandera    claims–-she       was    improperly        coerced    into   signing       the\n\nagreement       and   whether–-as        she     also     claims–-there         was     a\n\ncontemporaneous       side    agreement        that     the     contract   would       be\n\nrenegotiated in her favor after the election.                      Of course, such\n\nissues are surrounded by legal questions (e.g., when can a party\n\nclaim coercion by her own attorney as a defense vis-à-vis a third\n\nparty; does the parol evidence rule bar the showing of a side\n\nagreement); but one might need more facts, as well as briefing,\n\neven to address such issues.\n\n               Further, although Bandera's asserted subjective beliefs\n\nregarding the settlement likely do not bar enforcement (absent\n\ncoercion or a valid side agreement), conceivably she might argue\n\nthat some of the terms of the agreement are too indefinite to\n\nsupport a valid agreement or that Sheets' defeat in the election\n\nfrustrated      the   purpose      of   the    agreement.        Neither   of    these\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\farguments seems especially promising but both have been hinted at.\n\nThat the signed document contemplated a second more complete\n\nwritten       agreement     would    not     by   itself   automatically      preclude\n\ntreating the former as a binding contract.2\n\n               This brings us to the defendants' second attack on the\n\njudgment which concerns alleged errors at trial.                   We address these\n\nclaims now for a very obvious reason: although they would be mooted\n\nby a decision upholding the settlement agreement, the possibility\n\nexists that the settlement agreement will not prove a valid bar to\n\nthe judgment.          If so, it would be time wasting to have a second\n\nappeal to consider claims of trial error which are at this time\n\nfully briefed and equally legitimate challenges to the judgment.\n\n               Both of the claims of trial error center around the\n\ntestimony of Nancy Coletta, the City of Quincy police officer\n\ncalled by Bandera.          Prior to trial, when Coletta was identified as\n\na witness for Bandera, defendants anticipated that Coletta among\n\nothers would be asked to describe her own experiences with the\n\npolice and thus moved in limine for an order limiting or excluding\n\nsuch       testimony   on   the     ground    that   it    was   irrelevant    or,   if\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      An agreement to make a further more detailed agreement could\nin some instances not be intended as a binding contract, or might\nbe too indefinite; but neither is necessarily or even ordinarily\nso.

She testified that she had suffered major depression as\n\na result of this behavior.\n\n            In   addition,     Coletta   was   allowed   to   testify   over\n\nobjections by the defense as to how Coletta felt about, and\n\nassessed,    Bandera's   own    allegations.     In   particular,   Coletta\n\ntestified:\n\n            • that after reading about Bandera's claims\n              she (Coletta) had told another officer \"how\n              I felt that it was unfair and how I didn't\n              feel that they were giving you [Bandera] a\n              chance to show your potential, just like\n              they hadn't done to me. And that it's the\n              old-boy network\";\n\n             • that she (Coletta) had told another officer\n               that she thought that Bandera's \"potential\n               had been squashed by the men in the\n               department\"; and\n\n             • that she had told Bandera that she (Coletta)\n               had been placed on administrative leave due\n               to job stress and told her further that\n               Bandera \"had suffered from the same stuff .\n               . . .\"\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f            On appeal, the city says that Coletta's testimony was of\n\nminimal relevance but highly prejudicial, see Fed. R. Evid. 403,\n\nthat Coletta had no first hand knowledge of what happened to\n\nBandera and her views constituted inappropriate opinion testimony\n\nby a lay witness, Fed. R. Evid. 701, and that the testimony as to\n\nwhat Coletta said to other officers or Bandera was inadmissible\n\nhearsay, Fed. R. Evid. 801.          We consider separately the two phases\n\nof Coletta's testimony.\n\n            Coletta's recitation of her own experiences was relevant.\n\nThe most obvious relevance of Coletta's testimony–that she had\n\nsuffered similar harassment and reported it to Frane–was to show\n\nliability on the part of supervisory officers such as Frane and\n\nalso on the city for a pattern of knowing toleration of harassment\n\nby   its    subordinates.

They make only a generic\n\nobjection     that    the    experience      of    other    female      officers   is\n\ninherently remote and, where (as here) graphic, inherently more\n\nprejudicial    than    probative.

In   form    it     was\n\nhearsay–testimony of what the witness said to another outside of\n\ncourt   and    offered      for   the    truth    of    those    out    of    court\n\nstatements–but that is not its main vice.              Coletta, after all, was\n\nthere to be examined; and her statements would have had about the\n\nsame force if she had simply given her naked present assessment of\n\nBandera's situation instead of describing her earlier, out of court\n\nassessments.\n\n             The real problem is that, so far as it appears, Coletta\n\nhad no actual knowledge of what had happened to Bandera, and her\n\nassessments of what Bandera reported to have happened and the\n\npsychological impact on Bandera were wholly inappropriate opinion\n\ntestimony.

Coletta was not qualified as an expert on\n\nanything and her assessments were not the limited kind of opinion\n\ntestimony deemed helpful to a jury (e.g., an estimate of car speed\n\nor whether a defendant was intoxicated) but simply jury argument\n\noffered from the witness stand. The testimony should certainly not\n\nhave been admitted.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\f           If the basic objection–improper opinion testimony by a\n\nlay witness–had been preserved, we might be tempted to reverse.\n\nQuite possibly this phase of the testimony had fairly limited\n\nimpact:   Coletta's assessment of Bandera's situation was nothing\n\nlike so graphic as Coletta's admissible testimony as to her own\n\nexperience; her opinions as to Bandera's experience were mildly\n\nphrased; and the jury was far more likely to base its judgment on\n\nBandera's own detailed recitation of what had happened to her.\n\nStill, whether the testimony's admission could be described safely\n\nas harmless error is open to doubt.\n\n           But the objection was not in our view properly preserved.\n\nAdmittedly, the newly amended Federal Rules of Evidence sensibly\n\nprovide that an objection resolved by a definitive in limine ruling\n\nadmitting evidence need not be renewed at trial. F. R. Evid. 103(a)\n\n(2000).   But if the district judge ruled definitively on anything,\n\nit was that Coletta and similar witnesses could testify about their\n\nown experience and not that they could assess that of Bandera. This\n\nis evident from the in limine motion itself.\n\n           Then at trial when the opinion testimony was offered,\n\ndefense counsel said \"objection\" on several occasions; but few of\n\nthe objections were explained and the ones that were had to do with\n\ntime frame.   Given earlier general attacks on Coletta's testimony\n\nbased on relevance and prejudice, we do not think that it was at\n\nall necessarily obvious to the magistrate judge that the new\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fobjections were to impermissible lay witness opinion.      This is\n\nespecially so because several of the objections were specifically\n\nabout time frame.\n\n          The law is clear that an objection, if its basis is not\n\nobvious, is not preserved unless the ground is stated.

This case is a perfect illustration of why that\n\nrule is a sound one. Coletta's opinion testimony, although clearly\n\ninappropriate, was at the tag end of other testimony to which\n\ndifferent objections had been litigated pretrial.   If counsel had\n\nexplained why this new testimony differed and was in no way covered\n\nby the district court's in limine ruling, there is a good chance\n\nthat the magistrate judge would have excluded it.

However, the failure to preserve the\n\nobjection means review is at most for plain error. Fed. R.    Evid.\n\n\n     3\n      Although the point is not mentioned by defendants, the\nmagistrate judge may have borne some of the responsibility for this\nomission because she told the lawyers that in general they should\nsimply object and she would hold a bench conference if the basis\nfor the objection was unclear.      This may have been an unwise\ndirection, United States v. Gomes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198489\"><a href=\"/opinion/198489/united-states-v-gomes/\"><span class=\"volume\">177</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">76</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 80 (1st Cir. 1999),\nbut in any case she readily allowed counsel to approach the bench\nto spell out objections and defense counsel could easily have\nexplained at the bench how the opinion testimony differed from\nColetta's prior testimony about her own experience and why it was\nobjectionable.

This doubt alone is enough to bar reversal\n\nunder the plain error doctrine: although the error is plain in\n\nretrospect, there is no showing that it probably infected the\n\noutcome or caused a miscarriage of justice.
