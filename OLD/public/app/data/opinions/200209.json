This is an appeal from a\n\njudgment,      dismissing    petitioner-appellant       Stephen    Gruning's\n\napplication for a writ of habeas corpus pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254 (2000).        Petitioner appealed below, and the district court\n\nissued a limited certificate of appealability (\"COA\") on the issue\n\nof   whether    the    Massachusetts    state   court   violated   Gruning's\n\nconstitutional rights when it refused to provide Gruning with\n\nexclusive access to the audio recording of his court-ordered\n\npsychiatric examination.       For the reasons stated below, we affirm.\n\n                               I.   Background1\n\n            On the morning of February 12, 1995, Gruning went to the\n\napartment of his former girlfriend Rhonda Stuart.2          After breaking\n\ndown her front door with a sledgehammer, Gruning shot Stuart,\n\nseriously wounding her, and fatally shot Richard Stuart, her\n\nbrother, and Nelson DeOliveira, her boyfriend.           A jury sitting in\n\nEssex County Superior Court found Gruning guilty of armed assault\n\nwith intent to kill Stuart, second degree felony-murder of Richard\n\nStuart, manslaughter of DeOliveira, assault and battery by means of\n\na dangerous weapon, entering a dwelling while armed and using force\n\ntherein, and illegal possession of a firearm.\n\n\n1\n   For a more detailed description of the circumstances leading up\nto petitioner's imprisonment refer to Commonwealth v. Gruning, 710\nN.E.2d 621 (Mass. App. Ct. 1999).\n2\n   This petition is governed by the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act (AEDPA). Accordingly, we presume the facts as\ndetermined by the state court are correct. 28 U.S.C. § 2254(e)(1).\n\n                                       -2-\n\f            Following     the     trial,      Gruning     unsuccessfully       raised\n\nvarious claims in the Massachusetts Appeals Court, including a\n\nconstitutional challenge of the court's refusal to provide the\n\ndefense with sole access to the recording of Gruning's psychiatric\n\nevaluation.       The Supreme Judicial Court then rejected, without\n\nopinion,       further    appellate          review     of    Gruning's       claims.\n\nCommonwealth v. Gruning, 714 N.E.2d 825 (Mass. 1999).                    The United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts, acting on\n\nthe recommendation of the magistrate judge, dismissed Gruning's\n\nhabeas petition. Subsequently, the district court granted a COA on\n\nthe    issue    of    whether     the    trial        court   violated    Gruning's\n\nconstitutional       rights   when      it   denied     him   sole   access    to   an\n\naudiotape of his court-ordered psychiatric examination.3\n\n                          II.     Standard of Review\n\n            The      government      argues     that     we   should     apply      the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act's (AEDPA) deferential\n\nstandard as codified in 28 U.S.C. § 2254 (d)(1)-(2).4                      However,\n\n\n3\n    This court then denied Gruning's request to expand the COA.\n4\n      AEDPA provides:\n\n       (d) An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf\n       of a person in custody pursuant to the judgment of a\n       State court shall not be granted with respect to any\n       claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court\n       proceedings unless the adjudication of the claim--\n       (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or\n       involved an unreasonable application of, clearly\n       established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme\n       Court of the United States; or\n\n                                         -3-\n\fsection 2254(d) does not apply to this petition because the state\n\nappellate    court    did   not   address   Gruning's   claim   that   his\n\nconstitutional rights were violated when the trial court withheld\n\nthe audiotape.5      See Fortini v. Murphy, 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (stating that \"AEDPA's strict standard of review only applies\n\nto a 'claim that was adjudicated on the merits in state court\n\nproceedings'\" because \"we can hardly defer to the state court on an\n\nissue that the state court did not address\" (quoting 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d))). Consequently, we review Gruning's claim de novo. See\n\nid.\n\n         III.   Audio Recording of Psychiatric Examination\n\n            Prior to trial, Gruning's counsel suggested that there\n\nmight be an insanity defense.       Accordingly, the court allowed the\n\n\n      (2) resulted in a decision that was based on an\n      unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the\n      evidence presented in the State court proceeding.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2254(d).\n5\n   Gruning challenged the constitutionality of denying him sole\naccess to audiotape in his appeal to the Massachusetts Appellate\nCourt, but the court's discussion of the psychiatric examination\nfailed to address this issue:\n\n      Psychiatric examination. Conceding that Massachusetts\n      case law is to the contrary, the defendant nonetheless\n      claims that this court should adopt the dissenting view\n      in United States v. Byers, 239 U.S. App. D.C. 1, 740 F.2d\n      1104,   1161-1172   (D.C.  Cir.   1984)   (Bazelon,   J.,\n      dissenting), that there is a constitutional right to\n      counsel at the \"confrontation\" between the defendant and\n      the psychiatrist. We decline the invitation.\n\nGruning, 710 N.E.2d at 627 (citations omitted).\n\n                                    -4-\n\fCommonwealth's motion for a psychiatric examination pursuant to\n\nMass. R. Crim. P. 14(b)(2)(B) (2002).    At Gruning's request, the\n\nexamination   was   audio-recorded.    The   examining   psychiatrist\n\nsubsequently issued a report to the trial court as required by\n\nMass. R. Crim. P. 14(b)(2)(B)(iii).    The trial judge then ordered\n\nthat the report be redacted to prevent disclosure of petitioner's\n\nprivileged statements.   Gruning requested that the judge release a\n\ncopy of the audiotape only to the defense.          Analogizing the\n\nrecording to a psychiatric report, which Massachusetts law permits\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fa judge to release to both parties,6 the trial judge denied\n\nGruning's request for exclusive access to the tape.\n\n            Gruning argues that he and his attorney needed exclusive\n\naccess to the audiotape to assist them in making the decision of\n\nwhether Gruning should waive his privilege of silence.          They claim\n\nthat    denying   them   sole   access    to   the   tape   violated   both\n\npetitioner's right against self-incrimination and his due process\n\nright to \"the guiding hand of counsel at every step in the\n\nproceedings against him.\"       See Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 69\n\n\n6\n    The law provides:\n\n       (iii) The examiner shall file with the court a written\n       psychiatric report which shall contain his findings,\n       including specific statements of the basis thereof, as to\n       the mental condition of the defendant at the time the\n       alleged offense was committed.      The report shall be\n       sealed and shall not be made available to the parties\n       unless (a) the judge determines that the report contains\n       no matter, information, or evidence which is based upon\n       statements of the defendant as to his mental condition at\n       the time of or his criminal responsibility for the\n       alleged crime or which is otherwise within the scope of\n       the privilege against self-incrimination; or (b) the\n       defendant files a motion requesting that the report be\n       made available to the parties; or (c) during trial the\n       defendant raises the defense of lack of criminal\n       responsibility and the judge is satisfied that (1) the\n       defendant intends to testify in his own behalf or (2) the\n       defendant intends to offer expert testimony based in\n       whole or in part upon statements of the defendant as to\n       his mental condition at the time of or as to his criminal\n       responsibility for the alleged crime. If a psychiatric\n       report contains both privileged and nonprivileged matter,\n       the judge may, if feasible at such time as he deems\n       appropriate,   make   available   to   the  parties   the\n       nonprivileged portions.\n\nMass. R. Crim. P. 14(b)(2)(B)(iii).\n\n                                    -6-\n\f(1932).   Gruning's arguments rely upon an expansive reading of\n\nBrooks v. Tennessee, 406 U.S. 605 (1972).         In Brooks, petitioner\n\nsuccessfully argued that a Tennessee statute requiring that a\n\ncriminal defendant who wished to testify \"do so before any other\n\nwitnesses for the defense testify\" violated the constitutional\n\nrights of criminal defendants. Id. at 612 (quoting Tenn. Code Ann.\n\n§ 40-2403 (1955)).\n\n          The Brooks Court held that forcing the defendant to\n\ntestify first, if at all, violated his privilege against self-\n\nincrimination because the rule penalized him for remaining silent\n\nat the close of the state's case by excluding him from the stand\n\nlater in the trial.   \"Pressuring the defendant to take the stand,\n\nby   foreclosing   later    testimony   if   he   refuses,   is   not   a\n\nconstitutionally permissible means of ensuring his honesty. . . .\n\nIt fails to take into account the very real and legitimate concerns\n\nthat might motivate a defendant to exercise his right of silence.\"\n\nBrooks, 406 U.S. at 611-12.     In addition, the Court held that the\n\nstatute denied the defendant \"the 'guiding hand of counsel' in the\n\ntiming of [a] critical element of his defense\" because the statute\n\nforced the defendant and lawyer to decide whether the defendant\n\nshould testify \"without an opportunity to evaluate the actual worth\n\nof their evidence.\"        Id. at 612-13.     Crucial to the Court's\n\ndecision was the harshness of the penalty; if the defendant did not\n\ntestify first, he could not testify at all.        Id. at 612.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f             We can discern two arguments from petitioner's citation\n\nto Brooks.    First, petitioner has a right to evaluate the evidence\n\nagainst him before deciding whether to waive his privilege against\n\nself-incrimination.        Second, petitioner has a right to have his\n\nattorney evaluate the evidence and assist petitioner in making this\n\ndecision.     However, these rights to examine the evidence before\n\nwaiving privilege are not without bounds, and \"the law ordinarily\n\nconsiders a waiver knowing, intelligent, and sufficiently aware if\n\nthe defendant fully understands the nature of the right and how it\n\nwould likely apply in general in the circumstances--even though the\n\ndefendant may not know the specific detailed consequences of\n\ninvoking it.\"       United States v. Ruiz, 122 S. Ct. 2450, 2455-57\n\n(2002)   (holding       that    the    \"Constitution   does   not   require   the\n\nGovernment to disclose material impeachment evidence prior to\n\nentering a plea agreement with a criminal defendant\").\n\n             In   the    case    before    us,   petitioner   did   not   have   a\n\nconstitutional right to hear the audiotape before deciding if he\n\nwished to waive his privilege against self-incrimination.                     The\n\nConstitution does not \"'require that the police supply a suspect\n\nwith a flow of information to help him calibrate his self-interest\n\nin deciding whether to speak or stand by his rights.'\"              Colorado v.\n\nSpring, 479 U.S. 564, 576-77 (1987) (quoting Moran v. Burbine, 475\n\nU.S. 412, 422 (1986)).                \"Of course, the more information the\n\ndefendant has, the more aware he is of the likely consequences of\n\n\n                                          -8-\n\fa plea, waiver, or decision, and the wiser that decision likely\n\nwill be.   But the Constitution does not require the prosecutor to\n\nshare all useful information with the defendant.\" Ruiz, 122 S. Ct.\n\nat 2455.   \"[A] suspect's awareness of all the possible subjects of\n\nquestioning    in   advance    of   interrogation   is    not   relevant   to\n\ndetermining    whether   the    suspect    voluntarily,    knowingly,      and\n\nintelligently waived his Fifth Amendment privilege.\"            Spring, 479\n\nU.S. at 577.    Without hearing the audiotape, both Gruning and his\n\nattorney understood the nature of petitioner's right against self-\n\nincrimination \"and how it would likely apply in general in the\n\ncircumstances,\" thus satisfying constitutional requirements.               See\n\nRuiz, 122 S. Ct. at 2455.\n\n           Massachusetts law did give petitioner the opportunity to\n\nhear the audiotape before deciding whether petitioner should waive\n\nhis privilege, conditioned upon allowing the prosecution access to\n\nthe recording.      The defense made the tactical decision to choose\n\nwitnesses without listening to the tape, rather than to allow the\n\nprosecution access.      We realize that the defense would prefer\n\nexclusive access to the evidence and that, from the defense's point\n\nof view, the mere possession of incriminating evidence by the\n\nprosecution creates a disadvantage for the defense.                 But the\n\nquestion we are concerned with is whether this disadvantage rises\n\nto the level of a constitutional infirmity, and we believe that\n\nthis type of condition is not the type of coercion or compulsion\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fthat the Fifth Amendment guards against.      See Spring, 479 U.S. at\n\n572-74 (finding that defendant's \"allegation that the police failed\n\nto supply him with certain information does not relate to any of\n\nthe traditional indicia of coercion: 'the duration and conditions\n\nof detention . . . , the manifest attitude of the police toward\n\nhim, his physical and mental state, the diverse pressures which sap\n\nor sustain his power of resistance and self-control'\" (quoting\n\nCulombe v. Connecticut, 367 U.S. 568, 602 (1961))).     Allowing the\n\nprosecution to hear the audiotape was a mild condition, far removed\n\nfrom Fifth Amendment compulsion. Gruning could have chosen both to\n\nlisten to the audiotape and to invoke his privilege against self-\n\nincrimination.      The prosecution would have had possession of\n\nincriminating statements, but could not have used the statements in\n\ncourt unless the defense put the psychiatric evaluation into issue\n\nby having petitioner or his psychiatric expert testify.      Mass. R.\n\nCrim. P. 14(b)(2)(B)(iii). Gruning's decision of whether or not to\n\nwaive his privilege against self-incrimination was knowing and\n\nintelligent, and did not require the court to provide him sole\n\naccess to the audiotape of his psychiatric examination.\n\n                           IV.   Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court and dismiss petitioner's application for a writ\n\nof habeas corpus.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f",

The defense made the tactical decision to choose witnesses without listening to the tape, rather than to allow the prosecution access. We realize that the defense would prefer exclusive access to the evidence and that, from the defense's point of view, the mere possession of incriminating evidence by the prosecution creates a disadvantage for the defense. But the question we are concerned with is whether this disadvantage rises to the level of a constitutional infirmity, and we believe that this type of condition is not the type of coercion or compulsion that the Fifth Amendment guards against. <i>See Spring,</i> 479 U.S. at 572-74, 107 S.Ct. 851 (finding that defendant's \"allegation that the police failed to supply him with certain information does not relate to any of the traditional indicia of coercion: `the duration and conditions of detention ..., the manifest attitude of the police toward him, his physical and mental state, the diverse pressures which sap or sustain his power of resistance and self-control'\" (quoting <i>Culombe v. Connecticut,</i> 367 U.S. 568, 602, 81 S.Ct. 1860, 6 L.Ed.2d 1037 (1961))). Allowing the prosecution to hear the audiotape was a mild condition, far removed from Fifth Amendment compulsion. Gruning could have chosen both to listen to the audiotape and to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. The prosecution would have had possession of incriminating statements, but could not have used the statements in court unless the defense put the psychiatric evaluation into issue by having petitioner or his psychiatric expert testify. Mass. R.Crim. P. 14(b)(2)(B)(iii). Gruning's decision of whether or not to waive his privilege against self-incrimination was knowing and intelligent, and did not require the court to provide him sole access to the audiotape of his psychiatric examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV.

The examining psychiatrist subsequently issued a report to the trial court as required by Mass. R.Crim. P. 14(b)(2)(B)(iii). The trial judge then ordered that the report be redacted to prevent disclosure of petitioner's privileged statements. Gruning requested that the judge release a copy of the audiotape only to the defense. Analogizing the recording to a psychiatric report, which Massachusetts law permits a judge to release to <i>both</i> parties,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> the trial judge denied Gruning's request for exclusive access to the tape.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Gruning argues that he and his attorney needed exclusive access to the audiotape to assist them in making the decision of whether Gruning should waive his privilege of silence.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">851</span></a></span> (finding that defendant's \"allegation that the police failed to supply him with certain information does not relate to any of the traditional indicia of coercion: `the duration and conditions of detention ..., the manifest attitude of the police toward him, his physical and mental state, the diverse pressures which sap or sustain his power of resistance and self-control'\" (quoting <i>Culombe v. Connecticut,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106284\"><a href=\"/opinion/106284/culombe-v-connecticut/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">568</span></a></span>, 602, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106284\"><a href=\"/opinion/106284/culombe-v-connecticut/\"><span class=\"volume\">81</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Gruning could have chosen both to listen to the audiotape and to invoke his privilege against self-incrimination. The prosecution would have had possession of incriminating statements, but could not have used the statements in court unless the defense put the psychiatric evaluation into issue by having petitioner or his psychiatric expert testify. Mass. R.Crim. P. 14(b)(2)(B)(iii). Gruning's decision of whether or not to waive his privilege against self-incrimination was knowing and intelligent, and did not require the court to provide him sole access to the audiotape of his psychiatric examination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV.
