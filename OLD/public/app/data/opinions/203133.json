In 2005, Appellant Larry Dean\n\nAlexander      was     convicted     of   three    counts    of   possession   of   an\n\nunregistered sawed-off shotgun.1                  Following his trial, Alexander\n\nmade several motions for a mistrial or new trial, all of which the\n\ndistrict court denied as untimely.                    Alexander now appeals his\n\nconviction, arguing that there was insufficient evidence to sustain\n\nthe conviction and that the district court erred in denying his\n\nmotions for a mistrial or new trial.\n\n       For the following reasons, we AFFIRM.\n\n                                            I.\n\n       In December 2003, law enforcement officers arrested Marc\n\nWallace for possession of a sawed-off shotgun.                      Wallace claimed\n\nthat       Alexander    sold   him    the   shotgun     in   late   November   2003.\n\nHowever, the accounts of how Alexander sold the weapon to Wallace\n\nvaried among the witnesses called at Alexander’s trial.\n\n       Wallace testified Alexander handed Wallace the shotgun at the\n\nentrance to Wallace’s home, and Wallace then gave Alexander fifty\n\ndollars in exchange for the shotgun.                Wallace did not testify that\n\nAlexander covered or wrapped the shotgun in any way; rather, he\n\ntestified that he examined the shotgun prior to its purchase.                       He\n\n\n\n       1\n      One count was for possession of the unregistered weapon in\nviolation of 26 U.S.C. §§ 5861(d) and 5871; another count was for\npossession by a convicted felon in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n922(g)(1); and a third count charged possession after conviction of\na misdemeanor crime of domestic violence in violation of 18 U.S.C.\n§ 922(g)(9).\n\n                                            -2-\n\ffurther testified that when Alexander initially contacted him about\n\nthe gun, Alexander told him that the gun was “messed up” and that\n\nthe handle of the weapon was cut.\n\n     Kelly Ross, Wallace’s girlfriend, also testified that the sale\n\ntook place outside of Wallace’s home.         She testified that she saw\n\nAlexander reach into the trunk of his car, remove the shotgun,\n\nwhich was wrapped in a blanket, and hand the wrapped shotgun to\n\nWallace.    Ross explained that she did not see the shotgun inside\n\nthe blanket.   She further testified that Alexander explained that\n\nthe barrel of the shotgun was shortened, but he insisted the\n\nshotgun was of legal size.\n\n     Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms agent Brent McSweyn testified\n\nthat after Wallace’s arrest, he examined the shotgun and determined\n\nthat the barrel was shorter than the legal length.\n\n     After Alexander was convicted on all counts, the district\n\ncourt granted Alexander’s request for new counsel. Alexander later\n\nwrote the district court that he “would like to have a motion to\n\nchallenge   the   Jury’s   verdict,”    and   asserted   that    witnesses\n\nproffered false testimony during trial.         Alexander’s new counsel\n\nmoved pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 33, seeking a new trial, and\n\nargued that he was renewing the motion for a new trial that\n\nAlexander made by letter.    The district court, however, noted that\n\nAlexander did not formally docket the letter with the court, and\n\nthus denied Alexander’s “renewed motion” as untimely.           At no time\n\n                                  -3-\n\fduring the trial did Alexander move for judgment of acquittal\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 29.\n\n                                        II.\n\n     If Alexander did not properly preserve his objection, then we\n\n“can provide relief on a sufficiency challenge only if the verdict\n\nthreatens to work a clear and gross injustice.”                   United States v.\n\nGobbi, 471 F.3d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing United States v.\n\nMaldonado-Garcia, 446 F.3d 227, 230 (1st Cir. 2006), and United\n\nStates    v.     Hadfield,    918   F.2d      987,    996      (1st   Cir.    1990)).\n\nAdditionally,      we    do   not     evaluate       witness     credibility;        all\n\ncredibility issues are resolved “in favor of the verdict.”                     United\n\nStates v. Andujar, 49 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing United\n\nStates v. Garcia, 983 F.2d 1160, 1164 (1st Cir. 1993)).\n\n     We review a district court’s denial of a motion for a new\n\ntrial    under    Fed.   R.   Crim.    P.     33   for   a   “manifest       abuse   of\n\ndiscretion.”       United States v. Diaz, 300 F.3d 66, 78 (1st Cir.\n\n2002) (quoting United States v. Gonzalez-Gonzalez, 258 F.3d 16, 20\n\n(1st Cir. 2001)).\n\n                                       III.\n\n     To satisfy the statutes, “possession” of a weapon may be\n\n“either actual or constructive, sole or joint.”                   United States v.\n\nWight, 968 F.2d 1393, 1397 (1st Cir. 1992) (citations omitted).\n\n“In order to show constructive possession, the government must\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fprove that the defendant ‘had dominion and control over the area\n\nwhere the contraband was found.’” Id. (quoting United States v.\n\nBarnes, 890 F.2d 545, 549 (1st Cir. 1989), and citing United States\n\nv. Vargas, 945 F.2d 426, 428 (1st Cir. 1991), and United States v.\n\nLochan, 674 F.2d 960, 966 (1st Cir. 1982)).\n\n     There was sufficient evidence to prove that Alexander was in\n\npossession of the shotgun.      Both Wallace and Ross testified that\n\nAlexander removed the shotgun from Alexander’s car and then handed\n\nthe shotgun to Wallace.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n     On the question of knowledge, a defendant need not know every\n\ncharacteristic    of   the   weapon   that   subjects   the   weapon    to\n\nregulation.    United States v. DeBartolo, 482 F.2d 312, 316 (1st\n\nCir. 1973).    It is enough for the government to prove that the\n\ndefendant “knows that he is dealing with a dangerous device of such\n\ntype as would alert one to the likelihood of regulation.”         Id.    A\n\ndefendant can no more escape liability for failing to inspect the\n\nlength of a shotgun’s barrel than if he failed to inquire as to\n\nwhether the weapon is registered.       Id. at 317.\n\n     Although Alexander contends there was no proof that he knew\n\nthe shotgun was sawed off, there is sufficient evidence to dispute\n\nhis contention.    First, Alexander told Wallace that the gun was\n\n“messed up.”   Further, Ross testified that Alexander told them the\n\nbarrel of the weapon was shortened.       Finally, the government need\n\n                                  -5-\n\fnot have proved that Alexander knew every characteristic of the\n\nshotgun, but merely that he was in possession of the shotgun, and\n\nthus had a duty to inspect the size of the barrel.   Id.\n\n                                V.\n\n     The district court did not err in denying Alexander’s motion\n\nfor a new trial, and this court does not have the authority to\n\ngrant Alexander a new trial.     See Diaz, 300 F.3d at 78.     The\n\ndistrict court held that Alexander did not timely file his motions.\n\nThere is nothing in the record before us to suggest, nor does\n\nAlexander make a compelling argument, that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in finding the motions were untimely.\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",

It is enough for the government to prove that the\n\ndefendant “knows that he is dealing with a dangerous device of such\n\ntype as would alert one to the likelihood of regulation.”         Id.    A\n\ndefendant can no more escape liability for failing to inspect the\n\nlength of a shotgun’s barrel than if he failed to inquire as to\n\nwhether the weapon is registered.       Id. at 317.\n\n     Although Alexander contends there was no proof that he knew\n\nthe shotgun was sawed off, there is sufficient evidence to dispute\n\nhis contention.    First, Alexander told Wallace that the gun was\n\n“messed up.”   Further, Ross testified that Alexander told them the\n\nbarrel of the weapon was shortened.       Finally, the government need\n\n                                  -5-\n\fnot have proved that Alexander knew every characteristic of the\n\nshotgun, but merely that he was in possession of the shotgun, and\n\nthus had a duty to inspect the size of the barrel.   Id.\n\n                                V.\n\n     The district court did not err in denying Alexander’s motion\n\nfor a new trial, and this court does not have the authority to\n\ngrant Alexander a new trial.     See Diaz, 300 F.3d at 78.     The\n\ndistrict court held that Alexander did not timely file his motions.\n\nThere is nothing in the record before us to suggest, nor does\n\nAlexander make a compelling argument, that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in finding the motions were untimely.\n\n     AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f</pre>",
