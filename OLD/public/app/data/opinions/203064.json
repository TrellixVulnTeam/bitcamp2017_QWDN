Drew and Law Offices of Mona T. Movafaghi, PC on\nbrief for petitioner.\n     Peter D. Keisler, Acting Attorney General, Leslie McKay,\nSenior Litigation Counsel, and Angela N. Liang, Trial Attorney, on\nbrief for respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                          December 7, 2007\n\n\n\n     *\n      Pursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General\nMichael B. Mukasey has been substituted for former Attorney General\nAlberto R. Gonzáles as the respondent herein.\n\f           CYR, Senior Circuit Judge.    In 2001, Mary Jane Lumanauw,\n\na citizen and national of Indonesia, entered the United States,\n\nremained illegally after the expiration of her temporary visa, was\n\nplaced in removal proceedings, conceded removability, and filed an\n\nasylum    and   withholding-of-removal   application   based   on     her\n\nallegations that she had been persecuted in Indonesia because she\n\nis a Christian.    Specifically, petitioner alleged that in October\n\n1999, her ex-fiancé – a Muslim – had threatened to kill her and\n\nkidnap their minor daughter Sasha.       Three days later, three men\n\nwearing military uniforms came to the petitioner’s house asserting\n\nthe same demands. In December 2000, petitioner's ex-fiancé arrived\n\nat the house to get Sasha, but left without incident.      Petitioner\n\nreported the incident to the police, who informed the petitioner’s\n\nfather that “they had other serious matters to take care [of].”\n\nPetitioner contends that most police officers are Muslim, and that\n\nthey refused to assist her because she is a Christian.              After\n\nleaving Sasha with her parents, petitioner departed for the United\n\nStates.   Her parents and Sasha followed one year later.\n\n           After conducting an evidentiary hearing, the immigration\n\njudge (IJ) credited petitioner's testimony, but denied her asylum\n\napplication as untimely, in that it was filed more than one year\n\nafter her arrival in the United States.         Petitioner does not\n\nrequest review of this ruling.    See Tum v. Gonzales, 503 F.3d 159,\n\n160 (1st Cir. 2007) (noting that we lack jurisdiction to review a\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fdenial of an asylum application for untimeliness, citing 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(a)(3)).      With respect to the petitioner’s application for\n\nwithholding of removal, the IJ held that the petitioner failed to\n\nmeet her burden to prove a likelihood of future persecution upon\n\nher return to Indonesia, in that (i) her ex-fiancé’s threats were\n\nmotivated by his legitimate parental interest in Sasha, and not by\n\nany professed oppugnancy to the petitioner’s Christian beliefs;\n\n(ii)    the record contained no evidence to support the petitioner’s\n\nbald assertion that the police refused to protect her because she\n\nwas a Christian; and (iii) the petitioner eventually evaded further\n\nconfrontations with her ex-fiancé by relocating from Manado to\n\nJakarta.    On appeal, the BIA summarily affirmed the IJ’s ruling.\n\n            In her petition for review, Lumanauw contends that the\n\ndenial of her withholding application is erroneous because the\n\nadministrative record compels a finding that it is more likely than\n\nnot that she would be threatened by her ex-fiancé and the police on\n\naccount of her Christian beliefs were she repatriated to Indonesia.\n\nSee id. § 1231(b)(3)(A); Sunoto v. Gonzales, 504 F.3d 56, 60 (1st\n\nCir.    2007)   (noting   that    “we   use     the   deferential    substantial\n\nevidence standard for factual findings . . . [and will] ‘uphold the\n\nBIA's    decision    “unless     any    reasonable     adjudicator    would    be\n\ncompelled to conclude to the contrary”’”) (citations omitted).                 We\n\ndo not agree.\n\n            The     record   contains      no    conclusive    evidence       that\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fpetitioner’s ex-fiancé’s actions were motivated to any extent by\n\npetitioner’s Christian beliefs.              See Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d\n\n13,    18   (1st    Cir.     2003)    (noting     that      aliens     “must   provide\n\n‘conclusive evidence’ that they were targeted based on one of the\n\nfive asylum grounds”) (citation omitted).                   As the IJ aptly noted,\n\nher ex-fiancé mentioned her religion only once, threatening that,\n\nif petitioner chose not to surrender the custody of Sasha to him,\n\nhe could harm her with impunity by arranging it to appear as though\n\nher injuries had resulted from a random act of religious violence.\n\nThe IJ fairly inferred, therefore, that this was essentially a\n\nchild custody battle between estranged parents, and one which\n\nlikely would have occurred even if petitioner had been a Muslim.\n\nSee, e.g., Silva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting\n\nthat    withholding     of    removal       cannot     be     premised    on   what   is\n\n“essentially a personal dispute,” unrelated to animus toward one of\n\nfive    protected    statutory        classes     [e.g.,      a   religious    group])\n\n(emphasis added); Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n2004)    (same).       As    the     IJ’s    finding     is    amply     supported    by\n\nsubstantial record evidence, we deny the petition for review.\n\n             Denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\f",
