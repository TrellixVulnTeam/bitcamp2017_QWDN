For the reasons stated below, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                      FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\n\n           The    Nicolacis      are     former   shareholders   in     Cliftex\n\nCorporation      (“Cliftex”),       a    closely-held    corporation.         On\n\nJanuary 16, 1998, the Nicolacis, the Anapols and Cliftex executed\n\na Stock Purchase Agreement under which the Nicolacis sold their\n\nshares back to Cliftex.       The Anapols were officers, directors, and\n\nshareholders of Cliftex at the time.                The Nicolacis received\n\nvarying amounts of money for their shares, ranging from $1,000,000\n\npaid to John Nicolaci, to $25,000 paid to Lori and Lisa Boling.\n\nThe Agreement included cross-releases by the sellers and the buyers\n\nas well as an indemnity clause from the buyers to the sellers.               The\n\nrelease and indemnity given by Cliftex and the Anapols provided as\n\nfollows:\n\n                  (b) Each of Cliftex, Joel Anapol and\n           Walter Anapol hereby:\n\n                       (i) releases and discharges each\n           of the Sellers and their respective heirs,\n           representatives and assigns from and against\n           any claims, rights or causes of action which\n           such person may have against such Seller\n\n                                         -2-\n\f          arising from any fact, circumstance or\n          condition existing on the date hereof, whether\n          or not such claims, rights or causes of action\n          are known to Cliftex, Joel Anapol or Walter\n          Anapol, as the case may be, provided, however,\n          that this release shall not cover or apply to\n          any claims arising under this Agreement or any\n          agreement    or   instrument    delivered   in\n          connection herewith; and\n\n                      (ii) agrees to indemnify and hold\n          harmless each of the Sellers and their\n          respective heirs, representatives and assigns\n          from and against any claims, rights or causes\n          of action which relate to or which arise or\n          arose out of the business of Cliftex as\n          operated prior to or after the date of this\n          Agreement except to the extent the same have\n          been caused or incurred solely as the result\n          of the unauthorized and wrongful action of the\n          party seeking to be indemnified. . . .\n          (Emphasis added.)\n\n          About two and a half years later, in August 2000, Cliftex\n\nfiled a voluntary Chapter 7 bankruptcy petition in the District of\n\nMassachusetts.   A trustee of the estate was appointed. The Trustee\n\ncommenced an adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court alleging\n\nthat the stock purchase constituted a fraudulent transfer and\n\ndemanding that the Nicolacis return the money they received in\n\nexchange for their shares.     The Nicolacis filed a third-party\n\ncomplaint in the Trustee’s proceeding, asserting a claim for\n\nindemnity against the Anapols for any liability incurred as a\n\nresult of the fraudulent transfer claim.   On October 17, 2002, the\n\nBankruptcy Court dismissed the Nicolacis’ complaint for lack of\n\njurisdiction.\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f            The Nicolacis then commenced this action, again asserting\n\ntheir    indemnification     claims   against    the     Anapols      under   the\n\nAgreement and Massachusetts common law.             Treating the Anapols’\n\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings as a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to\n\ndismiss for failure to state a claim, the District Court dismissed\n\nthe   complaint,     holding   that   the    language     of    the    Agreement\n\nunambiguously excludes indemnification for claims arising out of\n\nthe stock purchase transaction.             The court also rejected the\n\nNicolacis’ common law indemnification claim.             The Nicolacis timely\n\nappealed.\n\n             The District Court had jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1332 and we have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\n                                DISCUSSION\n\nI.      STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n             We review de novo “a district court’s allowance of a\n\nmotion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.”               TAG/ICIB Servs.,\n\nInc. v. Pan Am Grain Co., Inc., 215 F.3d 172, 175 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nWe “accept as true the well-pleaded factual allegations of the\n\ncomplaint,    draw    all   reasonable      inferences    therefrom      in   the\n\nplaintiff’s favor, and determine whether the complaint, so read,\n\nsets forth facts sufficient to justify recovery on any cognizable\n\ntheory.” Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fII.    APPLICABLE LAW\n\n               “Federal     courts    sitting        in    diversity     apply      state\n\nsubstantive       law     and    federal      procedural      rules.”     Correia      v.\n\nFitzgerald, 354 F.3d 47, 53 (1st Cir. 2003).                      The parties agree\n\nthat Massachusetts law applies to both the contractual and common\n\nlaw claims in this appeal.\n\nIII. CONTRACTUAL INDEMNIFICATION\n\n               Contracts of indemnity are to be “fairly and reasonably\n\nconstrued in order to ascertain the intention of the parties and to\n\neffectuate the purpose sought to be accomplished.”                        Shea v. Bay\n\nState Gas Co., 418 N.E.2d 597, 600 (Mass. 1981).                        The Nicolacis\n\ncontend that the Trustee’s fraudulent transfer claim against them\n\nfalls        within   the       Agreement’s        indemnification      clause      and,\n\nalternatively, that the clause is ambiguous on this point. We find\n\nneither of these arguments persuasive.                    Reading the contract as a\n\nwhole, including the indemnification clause, the release clause,\n\nand the exclusion of the date of execution of the stock purchase\n\nagreement from the indemnification clause, we conclude that the\n\ncontract is unambiguous and the court was correct to enter judgment\n\nagainst the Nicolacis.\n\n        A.     The Language of the Indemnification Clause\n\n               The language of the Agreement limits indemnification to\n\nclaims “which relate to or which arise or arose out of the business\n\nof    Cliftex    as   operated      prior     to    or    after   the   date   of    this\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\fAgreement.”       The   Nicolacis   contend      that   the   Trustee’s   claim\n\nrelates to or arose out of Cliftex’s business and offer four\n\narguments in support:      (1) Cliftex and the Anapols were parties to\n\nthe   stock    purchase   agreement;       (2)   the    Anapols   and   Cliftex\n\nbenefitted from the stock purchase; (3) Cliftex funded the stock\n\npurchase; and (4) the Anapols’ operation of Cliftex subsequent to\n\nthe Agreement led to the bankruptcy and the fraudulent transfer\n\nclaim.\n\n              The term “business,” in its ordinary and common usage,\n\nrefers to regularly repeated activity for profit.1 This definition\n\nis supported by Massachusetts case law, which has long defined\n\n“business,” in considering what constitutes income, as “an activity\n\nwhich occupies the time, attention and labor of men for the purpose\n\nof livelihood, profit or gain.”        Brown, Rudnick, Freed & Gesmer v.\n\nBd. of Assessors of Boston, 450 N.E.2d 162, 164 (Mass. 1983);\n\nWhipple v. Comm’r of Corps. & Taxation, 161 N.E. 593, 595 (Mass.\n\n1928).    The business of Cliftex, or the purpose which occupied its\n\nemployees’ time, attention and labor for livelihood, profit and\n\ngain, was the manufacture of clothing.            There may be scenarios in\n\nwhich a company’s purchase of shares could come within the term\n\n“business as operated,” however, here the purchase of shares was a\n\n\n      1\n       Black’s Law Dictionary defines “business” as an            “employment\nhabitually engaged in for livelihood or gain.” BLACK ’S           LAW DICTIONARY\n211 (8th ed. 2004)(emphasis added). Webster’s defines             “operation”\nas “a process or action that is part of a series in               some work.”\nWEBSTER’S NEW WORLD DICTIONARY 949 (3d College Ed. 1998).\n\n                                     -6-\n\fone-time capital transaction unrelated to Cliftex’s recurring and\n\nhabitual operation of clothing manufacture.2           To the extent there\n\nis doubt about the content of the term “business as operated,” it\n\nis resolved against the Nicolacis in light of the contract as a\n\nwhole.\n\n            The Nicolacis’ argument that because the Anapols and\n\nCliftex benefitted from the purchase, it qualifies as the company’s\n\n“business,” is similarly unpersuasive.        If the company had no hope\n\nof deriving any benefit from a transaction that may be evidence\n\nthat the transaction is not part of the business operation.             But\n\nthe reverse is not true, as the discussion above indicates.\n\n            The argument that the Trustee’s claims arise out of\n\nCliftex’s business as operated because the Anapols’ operation of\n\nCliftex subsequent to the Agreement led to the bankruptcy and,\n\ntherefore, to the Trustee’s claim, lacks logic.              The Trustee’s\n\nclaim    regarding   the   stock   purchase   as   a   fraudulent   transfer\n\n“relates to” and “arose out of” the execution of the stock purchase\n\n\n\n     2\n      Massachusetts courts have noted the distinction, in the tax\ncontext, between capital transactions and business transactions.\nSee Comm’r of Corps. & Taxation v. Filoon, 38 N.E.2d 693, 700\n(Mass. 1941) (listing capital transactions and ordinary operations\nas distinct sources of profit); Follett v. Comm’r of Corps. &\nTaxation, 166 N.E. 575, 576-77 (Mass. 1929) (same).              A\ncorporation’s repurchase of its own stock would not be considered\npart of its ordinary business operations under either the common\nusage of the term or as Massachusetts courts have interpreted such\nlanguage. See Brown, 450 N.E.2d at 164; Filoon, 38 N.E.2d at 700;\nFollett, 166 N.E. at 576-77.\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f itself.     If the Agreement constituted a fraudulent transfer, it\n\n became such immediately upon execution. The indemnification clause\n\n itself expressly excludes claims on the date of the stock purchase\n\n agreement, furthering our understanding that the clause did not\n\n cover   the     repurchase   agreement.    While   it   is   true    that   the\n\n Trustee’s fraudulent transfer claim arose during and in the context\n\n of the bankruptcy proceeding, the claim against which the Nicolacis\n\n seek indemnification is that the transaction at issue, not the\n\n prior or subsequent operations of the business, defrauded Cliftex’s\n\n creditors. Further, as discussed below, the release clause is most\n\n consistently read with the indemnification clause to exclude claims\n\n arising from the stock repurchase.\n\n        B.      The Agreement Is Not Ambiguous\n\n                Under Massachusetts law, contract interpretation is a\n\nquestion of law for the court unless the contract is ambiguous.              See\n\nColl v. PB Diagnostic Sys., 50 F.3d 1115, 1122-23 (1st Cir. 1995);\n\nEdmonds v. United States, 642 F.2d 877, 881 (1st Cir. 1981). A\n\ncontract is ambiguous if “an agreement’s terms are inconsistent on\n\ntheir    face    or   where   the   phraseology   can    support     reasonable\n\ndifferences of opinion as to the meaning of the words employed and\n\nobligations undertaken.”        Lohnes v. Level 3 Communications, Inc.,\n\n272 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir. 2001) (citation omitted).             The question\n\nwhether a contract term is ambiguous is one of law for the court.\n\nAlison H. v. Byard, 163 F.3d 2, 6 (1st Cir. 1998); Allen v. Adage,\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fInc., 967 F.2d 695, 698 (1st Cir. 1992).            Ambiguity is not created\n\nmerely       because   the   litigants   disagree   about   the   meaning   of   a\n\ncontract.        See Byard, 163 F.3d at 6.\n\n                 The Nicolacis contend, in the alternative, that whether\n\nthe parties intended to exclude the stock purchase transaction from\n\nthe indemnification clause is, at best, a question of fact.                 They\n\nargue that the omission from the indemnification clause of specific\n\nlanguage about claims arising from the Agreement raises an inference\n\nthat such claims were intended to be covered because they are\n\nspecifically excluded from the release clauses.\n\n                 In interpreting contractual language, we consider the\n\ncontract as a whole.         Its meaning “cannot be delineated by isolating\n\nwords and interpreting them as though they stood alone.”               Starr v.\n\nFordham, 648 N.E.2d 1261, 1269 (Mass. 1995).           In the first paragraph\n\nof the “General Releases” clause, the Nicolacis agreed to release\n\nand discharge Cliftex and the Anapols from any and all existing\n\nclaims, except for “any claims arising under this Agreement.”3                   It\n\nwould be inconsistent for the parties to have preserved their rights\n\nto assert claims against each other arising from the Agreement, and\n\nat the same time for the Anapols to agree to indemnify the Nicolacis\n\nfor such claims.        These clauses, read together, indicate the intent\n\nof the parties to leave in place all liability arising from the\n\n\n\n         3\n             There are two other exceptions, but they are not pertinent\n here.\n\n                                         -9-\n\fAgreement itself. Far from being inconsistent, the clauses, taken\n\ntogether,   reflect   the     parties’    intent   to   exclude   from   the\n\nindemnification clause claims arising under the Agreement.               The\n\nTrustee’s claim, arising out of the allegedly fraudulent nature of\n\nthe stock purchase transaction, is therefore not covered by the\n\nindemnification clause.\n\n            The Agreement’s unambiguous language leaves no question\n\nof fact to be resolved, and the contract must be enforced according\n\nto its terms.     See Edmonds, 642 F.2d at 881.         We hold that, as a\n\nmatter of law, the terms of the Agreement exclude indemnification\n\nfor any liability arising out of the fraudulent transfer proceeding.\n\nIV.   COMMON LAW INDEMNIFICATION\n\n            The   Nicolacis    argue    that   Massachusetts   recognizes   a\n\ncommon-law right to indemnity where an innocent or comparatively\n\nfaultless party is held liable for another’s wrongdoing.           However,\n\nthis common law indemnity doctrine has been recognized only in\n\npersonal injury tort actions.          See Decker v. Black & Decker Mfg.\n\nCo., 449 N.E.2d 641 (1983); Rathburn v. W. Mass. Elec. Co., 479\n\nN.E.2d 1383 (1985).     Massachusetts courts have not applied this\n\ndoctrine to an alleged fraudulent transfer case.\n\n            The cases the Nicolacis cite do not state any general\n\nrules that establish or imply a duty to indemnify in the present\n\ncircumstances.     The cited cases address whether, in a personal\n\ninjury suit, a tortfeasor may seek indemnification from a more\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fculpable tortfeasor.    The Nicolacis concede that no Massachusetts\n\ncase has applied the common law indemnity doctrine in the context of\n\na fraudulent transfer proceeding.          They rest their claim on the\n\nabsence of cases precluding the doctrine from being applied to the\n\npresent case.\n\n            The District Court appropriately dismissed this claim.\n\nFederal   courts   sitting   in   diversity    should   be   cautious   about\n\n“push[ing] state law to new frontiers.”         Kelly v. Marcantonio, 187\n\nF.3d 192, 199 (1st Cir. 1999).       See also Taylor v. Aetna Cas. & Sur.\n\nCo., 867 F.2d 705, 706 (1st Cir. 1989) (stating that plaintiffs who\n\nchoose a federal forum for litigation of state law claims cannot\n\nexpect the court to “blaze a new trail” (citation omitted)).            In the\n\nabsence of authority supporting a common law right to indemnity in\n\nfraudulent transfer cases, we find no basis for the Nicolacis’\n\nclaim.\n\n                                  CONCLUSION\n\n            For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the\n\nDistrict Court dismissing the Nicolacis’ action.\n\n            AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\f",

On January 16, 1998, the Nicolacis, the Anapols and Cliftex executed a Stock Purchase Agreement under which the Nicolacis sold their shares back to Cliftex. The Anapols were officers, directors, and shareholders of Cliftex at the time. The Nicolacis received varying amounts of money for their shares, ranging from $1,000,000 paid to John Nicolaci, to $25,000 paid to Lori and Lisa Boling. The Agreement included cross-releases by the sellers and the buyers as well as an indemnity clause from the buyers to the sellers. The release and indemnity given by Cliftex and the Anapols provided as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) Each of Cliftex, Joel Anapol and Walter Anapol hereby:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) releases and discharges each of the Sellers and their respective heirs, representatives and assigns from and against any claims, rights or causes of action which such person may have against such Seller arising from any fact, circumstance or condition existing on the date hereof, whether or not such claims, rights or causes of action are known to Cliftex, Joel Anapol or Walter Anapol, as the case may be, provided, however, that <i>this release shall not cover or apply to any claims arising under this Agreement</i> or any agreement or instrument delivered in connection herewith; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of the Sellers and their respective heirs, representatives and assigns from and against any claims, rights or causes of action <i>which relate to or which arise or arose out of the business of Cliftex as operated prior to or after the date of this Agreement</i> except to the extent the same have been caused or incurred solely as the result of the unauthorized and wrongful action of the party seeking to be indemnified....

A trustee of the estate was appointed. The Trustee commenced an adversary proceeding in the Bankruptcy Court alleging that the stock purchase constituted a fraudulent transfer and demanding that the Nicolacis return the money they received in exchange for their shares. The Nicolacis filed a third-party complaint in the Trustee's proceeding, asserting a claim for indemnity against the Anapols for any liability incurred as a result of the fraudulent transfer claim. On October 17, 2002, the Bankruptcy Court dismissed the Nicolacis' complaint for lack of jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Nicolacis then commenced this action, again asserting their indemnification claims against the Anapols under the Agreement and Massachusetts common law. Treating the Anapols' motion for judgment on the pleadings as a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim, the District Court dismissed the complaint, holding that the language of the Agreement unambiguously excludes indemnification for claims arising out of the stock purchase transaction. The court also rejected the Nicolacis' common law indemnification claim.

Bay State Gas Co.,</i> 383 Mass. 218, 418 N.E.2d 597, 600 (1981). The Nicolacis contend that the Trustee's fraudulent transfer claim against them falls within the Agreement's indemnification clause and, alternatively, that the clause is ambiguous on this point. We find neither of these arguments persuasive. Reading the contract as a whole, including the indemnification clause, the release clause, and the exclusion of the date of execution of the stock purchase agreement from the indemnification clause, we conclude that the contract is unambiguous and the court was correct to enter judgment against the Nicolacis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Language of the Indemnification Clause</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the Agreement limits indemnification to claims \"which relate to or which arise or arose out of the business of Cliftex as operated prior to or after the date of this Agreement.\" The Nicolacis contend that the Trustee's claim relates to or arose out of Cliftex's business and offer four arguments in support: (1) Cliftex and the Anapols were parties to the stock purchase agreement; (2) the Anapols and Cliftex benefitted from the stock purchase; (3) Cliftex funded the stock purchase; and (4) the Anapols' operation of Cliftex subsequent to the Agreement led to the bankruptcy and the fraudulent transfer claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"business,\" in its ordinary and common usage, refers to regularly repeated activity for profit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> This definition is supported by Massachusetts case law, which has long defined \"business,\" in considering what constitutes income, as \"an activity which occupies the time, attention and labor of men for the purpose of livelihood, profit or gain.\" <i>Brown, Rudnick, Freed &amp; Gesmer v. Bd. of Assessors of Boston,</i> 389 Mass. 298, 450 N.E.2d 162, 164 (1983); <i>Whipple v. Comm'r of Corps. &amp; Taxation,</i> 263 Mass. 476, 161 N.E. 593, 595 (1928). The business of Cliftex, or the purpose which occupied its employees' time, attention and labor for livelihood, profit and gain, was the manufacture of clothing. There may be scenarios in which a company's purchase of shares could come within the term \"business as operated,\" however, here the purchase of shares was a one-time capital transaction unrelated to Cliftex's recurring and habitual operation of clothing manufacture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> To the extent there is doubt about the content of the term \"business as operated,\" it is resolved against the Nicolacis in light of the contract as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Nicolacis' argument that because the Anapols and Cliftex benefitted from the purchase, it qualifies as the company's \"business,\" is similarly unpersuasive. If the company had no hope of deriving any benefit from a transaction that may be evidence that the transaction is not part of the business operation. But the reverse is not true, as the discussion above indicates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument that the Trustee's claims arise out of Cliftex's business as operated because the Anapols' operation of Cliftex subsequent to the Agreement led to the bankruptcy and, therefore, to the Trustee's claim, lacks logic. The Trustee's claim regarding the stock purchase as a fraudulent transfer \"relates to\" and \"arose out of\" the execution of the stock purchase itself. If the Agreement constituted a fraudulent transfer, it became such immediately upon execution. The indemnification clause itself expressly excludes claims on the date of the stock purchase agreement, furthering our understanding that the clause did not cover the repurchase agreement. While it is true that the Trustee's fraudulent transfer claim arose during and in the context of the bankruptcy proceeding, the claim against which the Nicolacis seek indemnification is that the transaction at issue, not the prior or subsequent operations of the business, defrauded Cliftex's creditors. Further, as discussed below, the release clause is most consistently read with the indemnification clause to exclude claims arising from the stock repurchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Agreement Is Not Ambiguous</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, contract interpretation is a question of law for the court unless the contract is ambiguous. <i>See Coll v. PB Diagnostic Sys.,</i> 50 F.3d 1115, 1122-23 (1st Cir.1995); <i>Edmonds v. United States,</i> 642 F.2d 877, 881 (1st Cir. 1981). A contract is ambiguous if \"an agreement's terms are inconsistent on their face or where the phraseology can support reasonable differences of opinion as to the meaning of the words employed and obligations undertaken.\" <i>Lohnes v. Level 3 Communications, Inc.,</i> 272 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir.2001) (citation omitted). The question whether a contract term is ambiguous is one of law for the court. <i>Alison H. v. Byard,</i> 163 F.3d 2, 6 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Allen v. Adage, Inc.,</i> 967 F.2d 695, 698 (1st Cir.1992). Ambiguity is not created merely because the litigants disagree about the meaning of a contract. <i>See Byard,</i> 163 F.3d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Nicolacis contend, in the alternative, that whether the parties intended to exclude the stock purchase transaction from the indemnification clause is, at best, a question of fact. They argue that the omission from the indemnification clause of specific language about claims arising from the Agreement raises an inference that such claims were intended to be covered because they are specifically excluded from the release clauses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In interpreting contractual language, we consider the contract as a whole. Its meaning \"cannot be delineated by isolating words and interpreting them as though they stood alone.\" <i>Starr v. Fordham,</i> 420 Mass. 178, 648 N.E.2d 1261, 1269 (1995). In the first paragraph of the \"General Releases\" clause, the Nicolacis agreed to release and discharge Cliftex and the Anapols from any and all existing claims, except for \"any claims arising under this Agreement.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> It would be inconsistent for the parties to have preserved their rights to assert claims against each other arising from the Agreement, and at the same time for the Anapols to agree to indemnify the Nicolacis for such claims. These clauses, read together, indicate the intent of the parties to leave in place all liability arising from the Agreement itself. Far from being inconsistent, the clauses, taken together, reflect the parties' intent to exclude from the indemnification clause claims arising under the Agreement. The Trustee's claim, arising out of the allegedly fraudulent nature of the stock purchase transaction, is therefore not covered by the indemnification clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Agreement's unambiguous language leaves no question of fact to be resolved, and the contract must be enforced according to its terms. <i>See Edmonds,</i> 642 F.2d at 881. We hold that, as a matter of law, the terms of the Agreement exclude indemnification for any liability arising out of the fraudulent transfer proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. COMMON LAW INDEMNIFICATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Nicolacis argue that Massachusetts recognizes a common-law right to indemnity where an innocent or comparatively faultless party is held liable for another's wrongdoing. However, this common law indemnity doctrine has been recognized only in personal injury tort actions. <i>See Decker v. Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co.,</i> 389 Mass. 35, 449 N.E.2d 641 (1983); <i>Rathbun v. W. Mass. Elec. Co.,</i> 395 Mass. 361, 479 N.E.2d 1383 (1985). Massachusetts courts have not applied this doctrine to an alleged fraudulent transfer case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases the Nicolacis cite do not state any general rules that establish or imply a duty to indemnify in the present circumstances. The cited cases address whether, in a personal injury suit, a tortfeasor may seek indemnification from a more culpable tortfeasor. The Nicolacis concede that no Massachusetts case has applied the common law indemnity doctrine in the context of a fraudulent transfer proceeding. They rest their claim on the absence of cases precluding the doctrine from being applied to the present case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court appropriately dismissed this claim. Federal courts sitting in diversity should be cautious about \"push[ing] state law to new frontiers.\" <i>Kelly v. Marcantonio,</i> 187 F.3d 192, 199 (1st Cir.1999). <i>See also Taylor v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.,</i> 867 F.2d 705, 706 (1st Cir.1989) (stating that plaintiffs who choose a federal forum for litigation of state law claims cannot expect the court to \"blaze a new trail\" (citation omitted)). In the absence of authority supporting a common law right to indemnity in fraudulent transfer cases, we find no basis for the Nicolacis' claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated, we affirm the judgment of the District Court dismissing the Nicolacis' action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Black's Law Dictionary defines \"business\" as an \"employment<i>habitually</i> engaged in for livelihood or gain.\" BLACK'S LAW DICTIONARY 211 (8th ed.2004)(emphasis added).

The Nicolacis contend that the Trustee's fraudulent transfer claim against them falls within the Agreement's indemnification clause and, alternatively, that the clause is ambiguous on this point. We find neither of these arguments persuasive. Reading the contract as a whole, including the indemnification clause, the release clause, and the exclusion of the date of execution of the stock purchase agreement from the indemnification clause, we conclude that the contract is unambiguous and the court was correct to enter judgment against the Nicolacis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The Language of the Indemnification Clause</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The language of the Agreement limits indemnification to claims \"which relate to or which arise or arose out of the business of Cliftex as operated prior to or after the date of this Agreement.\" The Nicolacis contend that the Trustee's claim relates to or arose out of Cliftex's business and offer four arguments in support: (1) Cliftex and the Anapols were parties to the stock purchase agreement; (2) the Anapols and Cliftex benefitted from the stock purchase; (3) Cliftex funded the stock purchase; and (4) the Anapols' operation of Cliftex subsequent to the Agreement led to the bankruptcy and the fraudulent transfer claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The term \"business,\" in its ordinary and common usage, refers to regularly repeated activity for profit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> This definition is supported by Massachusetts case law, which has long defined \"business,\" in considering what constitutes income, as \"an activity which occupies the time, attention and labor of men for the purpose of livelihood, profit or gain.\" <i>Brown, Rudnick, Freed &amp; Gesmer v. Bd. of Assessors of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2238350\"><a href=\"/opinion/2238350/brown-rudnick-freed-gesmer-v-bd-of-ass-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">298</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2238350\"><a href=\"/opinion/2238350/brown-rudnick-freed-gesmer-v-bd-of-ass-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 164 (1983); <i>Whipple v. Comm'r of Corps. &amp; Taxation,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">263</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">593</span></span>, 595 (1928). The business of Cliftex, or the purpose which occupied its employees' time, attention and labor for livelihood, profit and gain, was the manufacture of clothing. There may be scenarios in which a company's purchase of shares could come within the term \"business as operated,\" however, here the purchase of shares was a one-time capital transaction unrelated to Cliftex's recurring and habitual operation of clothing manufacture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> To the extent there is doubt about the content of the term \"business as operated,\" it is resolved against the Nicolacis in light of the contract as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Nicolacis' argument that because the Anapols and Cliftex benefitted from the purchase, it qualifies as the company's \"business,\" is similarly unpersuasive. If the company had no hope of deriving any benefit from a transaction that may be evidence that the transaction is not part of the business operation. But the reverse is not true, as the discussion above indicates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The argument that the Trustee's claims arise out of Cliftex's business as operated because the Anapols' operation of Cliftex subsequent to the Agreement led to the bankruptcy and, therefore, to the Trustee's claim, lacks logic. The Trustee's claim regarding the stock purchase as a fraudulent transfer \"relates to\" and \"arose out of\" the execution of the stock purchase itself. If the Agreement constituted a fraudulent transfer, it became such immediately upon execution. The indemnification clause itself expressly excludes claims on the date of the stock purchase agreement, furthering our understanding that the clause did not cover the repurchase agreement. While it is true that the Trustee's fraudulent transfer claim arose during and in the context of the bankruptcy proceeding, the claim against which the Nicolacis seek indemnification is that the transaction at issue, not the prior or subsequent operations of the business, defrauded Cliftex's creditors. Further, as discussed below, the release clause is most consistently read with the indemnification clause to exclude claims arising from the stock repurchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Agreement Is Not Ambiguous</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, contract interpretation is a question of law for the court unless the contract is ambiguous. <i>See Coll v. PB Diagnostic Sys.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195995\"><a href=\"/opinion/195995/coll-v-pb-diagnostics/\"><span class=\"volume\">50</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1115</span></a></span>, 1122-23 (1st Cir.1995); <i>Edmonds v.

A contract is ambiguous if \"an agreement's terms are inconsistent on their face or where the phraseology can support reasonable differences of opinion as to the meaning of the words employed and obligations undertaken.\" <i>Lohnes v. Level 3 Communications, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199704\"><a href=\"/opinion/199704/lohnes-v-level-3-comm/\"><span class=\"volume\">272</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.2001) (citation omitted). The question whether a contract term is ambiguous is one of law for the court. <i>Alison H. v. Byard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198217\"><a href=\"/opinion/198217/h-v-byard-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Allen v.

Ambiguity is not created merely because the litigants disagree about the meaning of a contract. <i>See Byard,</i> 163 F.3d at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Nicolacis contend, in the alternative, that whether the parties intended to exclude the stock purchase transaction from the indemnification clause is, at best, a question of fact. They argue that the omission from the indemnification clause of specific language about claims arising from the Agreement raises an inference that such claims were intended to be covered because they are specifically excluded from the release clauses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In interpreting contractual language, we consider the contract as a whole. Its meaning \"cannot be delineated by isolating words and interpreting them as though they stood alone.\" <i>Starr v. Fordham,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">420</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">178</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">648</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1261</span></span>, 1269 (1995). In the first paragraph of the \"General Releases\" clause, the Nicolacis agreed to release and discharge Cliftex and the Anapols from any and all existing claims, except for \"any claims arising under this Agreement.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> It would be inconsistent for the parties to have preserved their rights to assert claims against each other arising from the Agreement, and at the same time for the Anapols to agree to indemnify the Nicolacis for such claims. These clauses, read together, indicate the intent of the parties to leave in place all liability arising from the Agreement itself. Far from being inconsistent, the clauses, taken together, reflect the parties' intent to exclude from the indemnification clause claims arising under the Agreement. The Trustee's claim, arising out of the allegedly fraudulent nature of the stock purchase transaction, is therefore not covered by the indemnification clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Agreement's unambiguous language leaves no question of fact to be resolved, and the contract must be enforced according to its terms. <i>See Edmonds,</i> 642 F.2d at 881. We hold that, as a matter of law, the terms of the Agreement exclude indemnification for any liability arising out of the fraudulent transfer proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. COMMON LAW INDEMNIFICATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Nicolacis argue that Massachusetts recognizes a common-law right to indemnity where an innocent or comparatively faultless party is held liable for another's wrongdoing. However, this common law indemnity doctrine has been recognized only in personal injury tort actions. <i>See Decker v. Black &amp; Decker Mfg. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">389</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">641</span></span> (1983); <i>Rathbun v.

Massachusetts courts have not applied this doctrine to an alleged fraudulent transfer case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases the Nicolacis cite do not state any general rules that establish or imply a duty to indemnify in the present circumstances. The cited cases address whether, in a personal injury suit, a tortfeasor may seek indemnification from a more culpable tortfeasor. The Nicolacis concede that no Massachusetts case has applied the common law indemnity doctrine in the context of a fraudulent transfer proceeding. They rest their claim on the absence of cases precluding the doctrine from being applied to the present case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The District Court appropriately dismissed this claim.
