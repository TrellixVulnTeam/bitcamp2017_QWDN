Jose A. Fuste, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n          Torruella, Lynch, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Ramón E.

González, on brief for third-party defendant\nL.P.C.&D. Inc.\n\n\n\n\n                       September 14, 2006\n\f             Per Curiam. After a thorough review of the record and of\n\nthe parties’ submissions, we affirm.                 We agree that the claims\n\nagainst     the   Puerto   Rico   Highway      and   Transportation     Authority\n\n(PHRTA) and Fernando Fagundo are barred by principles of res\n\njudicata. “Under the federal law of res judicata, a final judgment\n\non the merits of an action precludes the parties from relitigating\n\nclaims that were raised or could have been raised in that action.”\n\nMaher v. GSI Lumonics, Inc., 433 F.3d 123, 126 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted). The appellants\n\nadmit that they raised two of the instant claims – those having to\n\ndo with invasions onto their land in September and November 2003 –\n\nin the previous federal proceeding.               The remaining claims have to\n\ndo   with   the   proceedings     in     the   expropriation   court,    and   the\n\nappellants argue that they could not have raised those claims in\n\nthe previous federal cases because they occurred after the filing\n\nof those Complaints.       Nevertheless, appellants could have brought\n\nthose claims in the previous federal litigation by moving to amend\n\ntheir Complaint. Leave to amend should be “freely given,” see Fed.\n\nR.   Civ.   P.    15(a),   and    Rule    15(c)    specifically   provides     for\n\nsupplemental pleadings “setting forth transactions or occurrences\n\nor events which have happened since the date of the pleading sought\n\nto be supplemented.”        Their claims should have been added to the\n\nprevious litigation because they are all part of the appellants’\n\noverarching due process claim that the PHRTA has had a “callous\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\findifference to citizens’ civil rights” throughout the process of\n\nthe highway construction project. See Kale v. Combined Ins. Co. of\n\nAmerica, 924 F.2d 1161, 1165 (1st Cir. 1991) (res judicata bars all\n\nrelated claims that could have been brought in previous action)\n\n(citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(e)(2) (a party may “state as many\n\nseparate claims or defenses as the party has”); Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n18(a) (party may join “as many claims [] as the party has against\n\nan opposing party)).\n\n             Appellants also argue that res judicata does not apply\n\nhere because the previous federal cases were not dismissed on the\n\nmerits. See Maher, 433 F.3d at 126 (res judicata requires previous\n\nadjudication on the merits).          But clearly the appellants are wrong\n\nin the characterization of the previous dismissal.                The procedural\n\nand substantive due process claims were dismissed for failure to\n\nstate a claim, and that dismissal was affirmed by this court.                 Such\n\na   dismissal   is   with    prejudice     unless   the   order    of   dismissal\n\nexplicitly says otherwise (and here, there is no such explicit\n\nstatement).     See U.S. ex rel. Karvelas v. Melrose-Wakefield Hosp.,\n\n360 F.3d 220, 242 (1st Cir.) (citations omitted), cert. denied, 543\n\nU.S.   820   (2004).        Because   the    previous     dismissal     was   with\n\nprejudice, res judicata precludes relitigation of claims that were\n\nor could have been raised in the previous case.\n\n             We also agree that the claims against the Honorable\n\nHector   López-Garcia       are   barred     by   the   doctrine   of   judicial\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fimmunity. Citing Pulliam v. Allen, 466 U.S. 522 (1984), appellants\n\nargue      that   judicial   immunity    does    not    apply    to   claims     for\n\ninjunctive and declaratory relief under section 1983 (they concede\n\nthat they did not seek money damages against Judge López).                   While\n\nPulliam did hold that judicial immunity was not a bar to claims for\n\ninjunctive or declaratory relief under section 1983, see id. at\n\n541-42, that case was superseded by statute in 1996.                    “[I]n any\n\naction brought against a judicial officer for an act or omission\n\ntaken in such officer's judicial capacity, injunctive relief shall\n\nnot   be    granted   unless   a   declaratory     decree       was   violated    or\n\ndeclaratory relief was unavailable.”              Pub. L. No. 104-317, 110\n\nStat. 3847 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (1996)).                     The\n\nappellants do not argue that the statutory exceptions set out in\n\nthis provision should apply.         Accordingly, their challenge to the\n\ndistrict court’s decision on this point fails.\n\n              Finally, we note that dismissal of this action was proper\n\nfor another reason: the claims which directly challenge the result\n\nof the state expropriation proceedings are barred by the Rooker-\n\nFeldman doctrine.       See District of Columbia Court of Appeals v.\n\nFeldman, 460 U.S. 462 (1983); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263\n\nU.S. 413 (1923).       The Rooker-Feldman doctrine bars “cases brought\n\nby state-court losers complaining of injuries caused by state-court\n\njudgments rendered before the district court proceedings commenced\n\nand   inviting      district   court    review    and    rejection      of   those\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fjudgments.”      Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544\n\nU.S.   280,    284   (2005).     The    doctrine    applies     where    plaintiff\n\nexplicitly seeks review of a state court judgment and also where\n\nreview is implicitly sought.           See Federación de Maestros v. Junta\n\nde Relaciones del Trabajo, 410 F.3d 17, 24 (1st Cir. 2005).                    The\n\nappellants lost in the state proceeding; they complain that they\n\nwere injured as a result of Judge López’s ruling; and judgment\n\nentered in the state case in November 2003, long before this case\n\nwas filed in November 2004.         They claim that the state proceeding\n\nwas manipulated by the PHRTA, that Judge López was biased, that he\n\nillegally      suppressed      evidence,      and   that   he    acted    without\n\njurisdiction.        To the extent appellants are asking the federal\n\ncourt to review Judge López’s decisions, their claims are barred by\n\nthe Rooker-Feldman doctrine.\n\n              Affirmed.   See 1st Cir. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f",
