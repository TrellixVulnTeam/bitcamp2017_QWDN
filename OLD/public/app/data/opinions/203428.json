Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n              Boudin, Stahl, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Charles F. Willson and Nevins & Nevins LLP, on brief for\nappellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Germán A.\nRieckehoff, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-\nVélez, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              August 8, 2008\n\f            Per   Curiam.   This   is    defendant's   appeal    from   his\n\nresentencing under the now-advisory guidelines after United States\n\nv. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).     On appeal, defendant raises three\n\narguments: (1) that the district court erred in refusing to credit\n\nthe time he had already served on a related local offense; (2) that\n\nthe sentence imposed was unreasonably high because it failed to\n\naccount for the guidelines' disparity in offense levels between\n\ncrack and    powder cocaine; and (3) that he is entitled to a\n\nreduction of his sentence under the recent amendments to the crack\n\nguidelines, which were made retroactive after his opening brief was\n\nfiled.   We will consider each of these arguments in turn.\n\n            At resentencing, defendant asked that the time that he\n\nhad already served on a related local firearms sentence be credited\n\nagainst his federal sentence under USSG § 5G1.3 (Nov. 1, 1992\n\ned.).1     The court summarily denied that request.             On appeal,\n\ndefendant presses that argument, and the government concedes that\n\na remand is warranted on that issue, albeit for a more limited\n\npurpose.    For the following reasons, we agree that, under the\n\nguidelines, defendant is entitled to credit for time served in\n\nstate custody.\n\n\n\n     1\n      In an amended plea agreement, entered into before defendant's\noriginal sentencing, the parties stipulated that the 1992 version\nof the guidelines should be applied, and the district court went\nalong with that stipulation.         Therefore, unless otherwise\nindicated, all references to the sentencing guidelines herein will\nbe to the November 1, 1992 edition.\n\n                                   -2-\n\f              Under application note 2 to USSG § 5G1.3, \"the court\n\nshould adjust for any term of imprisonment already served as a\n\nresult   of    the   conduct   taken   into   account   in   determining   the\n\nsentence for the instant offense.\"              Later amendments to that\n\nguideline and commentary clarified2 that the court should apply\n\nsuch a credit only if it determines that the state offense is\n\n\"relevant conduct to the instant offense\" and \"has resulted in an\n\nincrease in the . . . offense level for the instant offense,\" USSG,\n\n§ 5G1.3, comment. (n.2(A)), as amended by Amendment 660 (effective\n\nNov. 1, 2003), and that the Bureau of Prisons will not apply such\n\na credit, USSG § 5G1.3(b), as amended by Amendment 535 (effective\n\nNov. 1, 1995).\n\n              The first two requirements are clearly satisfied here.\n\nAs to the first requirement, defendant's local firearms offense\n\ninvolved storing weapons used by members of the federal conspiracy\n\nat the various drug points of that conspiracy during the time\n\nperiod of the conspiracy.         That offense was therefore \"relevant\n\nconduct\" within the meaning of USSG, § 1B1.3(a)(1)(A).\n\n              As to the second requirement, the local firearms offense\n\ndid result in an increase in defendant's offense level under USSG\n\n§ 2D1.1(b)(1).       Although the court was not required to accept the\n\n\n\n     2\n      Because those amendments were intended to be clarifying, USSG\nManual, amend. 660, app. C, vol. II, at 410; amend. 535, app. C.,\nvol. I, at 468, they \"may be applied retroactively,\" United States\nv. Carrasco-Mateo, 389 F.3d 239, 245 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                       -3-\n\fparties' stipulation to that effect, it was entitled to do so,\n\nUnited States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 28 (1st Cir. 2001), and, in\n\nfact, did so. Therefore, contrary to the government's argument, no\n\nremand is required for the purpose of determining whether the\n\ncourt, in fact, increased defendant's offense level based on the\n\nlocal firearms offense for which he is seeking credit for time\n\nserved.\n\n          As to the third requirement--that credit will not be\n\ngiven by the Bureau of Prisons--the record is unclear.    At the time\n\nof resentencing, defense counsel had been unable to determine\n\nprecisely how much time defendant had served on his state sentence\n\nbefore he was taken into federal custody and how much of that time\n\nhad been credited to him by the Bureau of Prisons.       Therefore, a\n\nremand is necessary to enable the district court to make those\n\nfactual determinations and subtract any previously uncredited time\n\nfrom defendant's advisory guidelines sentence.\n\n             Next,   defendant   argues   that   his   sentence    is\n\n unreasonable because it fails to account for          the disparity\n\n between the guideline offense levels for crack and powder cocaine\n\n offenses.    Because that argument was not preserved below, it is\n\n reviewable only for plain error.   United States v. Matos, 2008 WL\n\n 2687385, at *1 (1st Cir. July 10, 2008) (citing United States v.\n\n Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 78 (2005)).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f              No    such   error    occurred        here,   plain   or    otherwise.\n\nAlthough the Supreme Court recently held that \"it would not be an\n\nabuse    of    discretion     for   a    district      court   to   conclude      when\n\nsentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity\n\nyields a sentence 'greater than necessary' to achieve § 3553(a)'s\n\npurposes,\" Kimbrough v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 558 (2007),\n\nnothing in Kimbrough requires the district court to take such\n\ndisparity into account in every crack case, particularly where,\n\nas here, the defendant did not seek a below-guidelines sentence\n\non that or any other ground.                  United States v. King, 518 F.3d\n\n571, 576 (8th Cir. 2008); see generally Gall v. United States,\n\n128 S. Ct. 586, 599 (2007) (deeming \"it . . . not incumbent on\n\nthe District Judge to raise every conceivably relevant issue on\n\nhis own initiative\"); United States v. Alli, 444 F.3d 34, 41 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (declining to fault district judge for failing to\n\nconsider factors that were not raised for his consideration).\n\n              Moreover, the remaining two prongs of the plain-error\n\nstandard--\"that        this   error      affected      defendant's       substantial\n\nrights    and      would   impair   confidence        in    the   justice    of     the\n\nproceedings,\" Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75--are not satisfied\n\nhere.         Defendant    points       to     no   \"circumstances       creating    a\n\nreasonable probability that the district court would impose a\n\ndifferent sentence more favorable to the defendant,\" id., if it\n\nrealized that it could do so based on crack/powder disparity\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\f\"even in a mine-run case,\" Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 575.                      There\n\nis no indication that the court felt constrained by the harshness\n\nof the crack guidelines as compared to those for power cocaine.\n\nIndeed, crack was never mentioned by either party or the court at\n\nany point during the resentencing hearing.                     Rather, the court\n\nclearly signaled its aversion to a lower sentence by emphasizing\n\nthe   seriousness       of    defendant's       criminal    record--including       a\n\nmurder conviction and two firearms convictions that were not\n\ncounted in computing his criminal history score.                     The court's\n\ndecision to reimpose the same 324-month sentence it had imposed\n\nunder   the    mandatory       guidelines,       despite    the   fact    that    the\n\nguidelines range had been reduced (for reasons not relevant here)\n\nso that the sentence now fell in the middle rather than the\n\nbottom of the range, also \"speaks volumes\" about the court's\n\ndisinclination to impose a lower sentence.                     United States v.\n\nMcLean, 409 F.3d 492, 505 (1st Cir. 2005).                  Therefore, under the\n\nplain-error standard, no remand for resentencing under Kimbrough\n\nis warranted.\n\n              In    further    support     of    his     crack/powder     disparity\n\nargument, defendant points to the recent amendments to the crack\n\nguidelines,        reducing    the    base      offense    levels   for    various\n\nquantities     of     crack    by   two   levels,      USSG,   amends.    706,    711\n\n(effective         November    1,    2007),      which     were   recently       made\n\nretroactive, USSG, amend. 713 (effective Mar. 3, 2008).                      To the\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fextent that defendant is asking this court to apply the amended\n\nguidelines in assessing the reasonableness of his sentence, that\n\nrequest is misdirected.   Motions for a reduced sentence based on\n\nnewly promulgated, retroactive guidelines should be addressed, in\n\nthe first instance, to the district court.      See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n3582(c); see also United States v. Connell, 960 F.2d 191, 197\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\n          Accordingly, this case is remanded to the district\n\ncourt for the limited purposes of: (1) determining the amount of\n\ntime defendant had served on his related local firearms sentence\n\nbefore being taken into federal custody and how much of that time\n\nhas not been credited to defendant by the Bureau of Prisons; (2)\n\ndeducting any previously uncredited time from his 324-month\n\nadvisory guidelines sentence; (3) considering and explaining\n\nwhether the resulting sentence is \"sufficient but not greater\n\nthan necessary\" to comply with the purposes of sentencing set\n\nforth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a); and (4) if not, imposing a new\n\nsentence and explaining its reasons for doing so.   In all other\n\nrespects, the district court's judgment is affirmed.   On remand,\n\ndefendant may also file a motion to further reduce his sentence\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 3582(c) and USSG § 1B1.10 as recently amended.\n\nMatos, 2008 WL 2687385, at *2.       We express no view on the\n\nappropriate disposition of any such motion.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

Defendant    points       to     no   \"circumstances       creating    a\n\nreasonable probability that the district court would impose a\n\ndifferent sentence more favorable to the defendant,\" id., if it\n\nrealized that it could do so based on crack/powder disparity\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\f\"even in a mine-run case,\" Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 575.                      There\n\nis no indication that the court felt constrained by the harshness\n\nof the crack guidelines as compared to those for power cocaine.\n\nIndeed, crack was never mentioned by either party or the court at\n\nany point during the resentencing hearing.                     Rather, the court\n\nclearly signaled its aversion to a lower sentence by emphasizing\n\nthe   seriousness       of    defendant's       criminal    record--including       a\n\nmurder conviction and two firearms convictions that were not\n\ncounted in computing his criminal history score.                     The court's\n\ndecision to reimpose the same 324-month sentence it had imposed\n\nunder   the    mandatory       guidelines,       despite    the   fact    that    the\n\nguidelines range had been reduced (for reasons not relevant here)\n\nso that the sentence now fell in the middle rather than the\n\nbottom of the range, also \"speaks volumes\" about the court's\n\ndisinclination to impose a lower sentence.

Therefore, under the\n\nplain-error standard, no remand for resentencing under Kimbrough\n\nis warranted.\n\n              In    further    support     of    his     crack/powder     disparity\n\nargument, defendant points to the recent amendments to the crack\n\nguidelines,        reducing    the    base      offense    levels   for    various\n\nquantities     of     crack    by   two   levels,      USSG,   amends.    706,    711\n\n(effective         November    1,    2007),      which     were   recently       made\n\nretroactive, USSG, amend. 713 (effective Mar. 3, 2008).
