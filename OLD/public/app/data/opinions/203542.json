Keisler, Assistant\nAttorney General, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                           October 29, 2008\n\f           Per Curiam.      Petitioner Zheng, a citizen of China with\n\ntwo American born children, seeks to reinstate her appeal of the\n\ndenial by the Board of Immigration [BIA] of Zheng's request for\n\nasylum and related relief.           She alleges that the appeal was\n\nwithdrawn by her attorney due to a miscommunication and that she\n\nnever intended to abandon the appeal.           Zheng also seeks judicial\n\nreview of a decision by the BIA denying her motion to reopen\n\nimmigration proceedings, on the basis of newly discovered evidence.\n\nZheng may reinstate the original appeal. Nevertheless, we deny the\n\nrequests for relief.\n\n           While   the   voluntary      dismissal   of    an   appeal   usually\n\ndeprives an appellate court of jurisdiction, see United States v.\n\nArevalo,   408   F.3d    1233,   1236    (9th   Cir.     2005),   courts   have\n\nreinstated out of time appeals in extraordinary circumstances, such\n\nas when an appeal has been dismissed by an attorney without the\n\napproval of the client, Turker v. Ohio Dept. of Rehabilitation &\n\nCorrections, 157 F.3d 453, 456 (6th Cir. 1998). Since it is\n\nuncontested that the instant appeal was withdrawn without Zheng's\n\nconsent, we reinstate the appeal.           Nevertheless, it is without\n\nmerit.\n\n           Petitioner's original claim was denied because the\n\nimmigration judge found her hearing testimony not to be credible.\n\nThe judge also found her petition to be frivolous, a finding which\n\nwould have barred petitioner from ever seeking to have her\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fimmigration status adjusted.           On appeal, the BIA affirmed the\n\ndenial of the petition on the ground that the immigration judge's\n\ncredibility findings were not clear error.               However, it reversed\n\nthe determination that the application was frivolous.\n\n            Petitioner now claims that the credibility determination\n\nof the immigration judge was not sustainable because the BIA\n\nrefused to uphold the finding that the asylum application was\n\nfrivolous. Since the BIA's reversal of the latter ruling does not\n\nundermine    its    specific   finding      that   the   judge's    credibility\n\ndetermination was supportable, the initial appeal is without\n\nmerit.\n\n            After her initial petition was denied, Zheng sought to\n\nreopen proceedings based on alleged new evidence.                  The evidence\n\nconsisted of affidavits from Zheng and her family, as well as\n\ndocuments    from    the   Fujian    Provincial     Population      and   Family\n\nPlanning Commission (Zheng is a native of Fujian Province) and an\n\naffidavit from one John Aird, said to be an expert on Chinese\n\npopulation control policy.          The BIA held that, in light of State\n\nDepartment country condition reports indicating that Chinese\n\nnationals who return to China are not being subjected to forced\n\nsterilization, Zheng had failed to establish her eligibility for\n\nasylum and related relief. In the alternative, the BIA denied the\n\nrequest on the grounds that the evidence presented was previously\n\navailable.    This court reviews denials of motions to reopen for\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fabuse of discretion.        Zhang v. INS, 348 F.3d 289, 292 (1st Cir.\n\n2003). Review is \"highly deferential, focusing on the rationality\n\nof the decision to deny reconsideration and reopening, not on the\n\nmerits per se, of the underlying claim.\"              Abdullah v. Gonzales,\n\n461 F.3d 92, 99 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n              In order to reopen successfully a removal proceeding,\n\nan   alien    must   both   \"establish    a   prima   facie   case   for   the\n\nunderlying substantive relief sought,\" Zeng v. Gonzales, 436 F.3d\n\n26, 29 (1st Cir. 2006) (citations omitted), and show that the\n\nevidence presented \"was not available and could not have been\n\ndiscovered or presented at the former hearing,\" 8 C.F.R. ยง\n\n1003.2(c)(1).        Even if both showings are met, the BIA retains\n\ndiscretion to deny the motion,       Maryam v. Gonzales, 421 F.3d 60,\n\n62 (1st Cir. 2005). Zheng alleges that, if returned to China, she\n\nwill likely undergo forced sterilization under China's one child\n\npolicy, because she already has two children.             Under INA Section\n\n101(a)(42)(B), being forced to abort a pregnancy or to undergo\n\nsterilization is per se persecution on account of political\n\nopinion.\n\n              In the instant case, the documents submitted indicate\n\nthat Zheng will likely face sanctions and penalties upon her\n\nreturn.      This is insufficient to constitute persecution.          See In\n\nre J-W-S, 24 I & N Dec. 185, 191 (BIA 2007) (\"Enforcement efforts\n\nresulting in moderate economic impact would not, in general, prove\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fa well-founded fear of future persecution.\") (citing cases).\n\nMoreover, much of the evidence appears to have been available\n\nprior to the determination of her first request for relief in\n\n2005.\n\n          Absent substantiation, self serving affidavits from\n\npetitioner and her immediate family are of limited evidentiary\n\nvalue.   Moreover, the affidavit from Zheng claims only that\n\nofficials in her home town have \"notified [her] family in China\n\nthat I should undergo sterilization upon my return to China,\" not\n\nthat she would be compelled to do so.   A.R. 15.\n\n          The Aird affidavit, which has been used in several\n\nsimilar cases, has been consistently found to be less convincing\n\nthan the State Department Country Reports which indicate that a\n\nreturnee who has children will be penalized upon return, if at\n\nall, only by fines or other economic penalties.    See Wang v. BIA,\n\n437 F.3d 270, 276 (2d Cir. 2006) (\"a balancing of the 2004 Country\n\nReport against the Aird affidavit's criticism . . . would lead to\n\nthe conclusion . . . that petitioner has not shown he would face\n\nanything more than economic sanctions if returned to China\"); In\n\nre J-W-S, 24 I & N Dec. at 191-92 (same); In re C-C, 23 I & N Dec.\n\n899, 902-03 (BIA 2006) (same); but see Guo v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d\n\n556, 564-66 (3d Cir. 2004) (holding Aird affidavit sufficient to\n\nestablish prima facie case of likely persecution).    The strength\n\nof the Aird affidavit is undermined both by the fact that it is\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fnot based on personal knowledge and especially by the fact that\n\nit \"refer[s] to no incidents of forced sterilization of parents\n\nwho return to China with children born abroad.\"          In re J-W-S, 24\n\nI & N Dec. at 190.      Finally, it should be noted that the Aird\n\naffidavit pre-dates Zheng's original BIA decision and hence is not\n\nnew evidence.\n\n             Zheng also relies on two documents from Fujian Province.\n\nThe first is a reply from the State Population and Family Planning\n\nCommission to a question regarding the applicability of family\n\nplanning laws to Chinese citizens who have (like Zheng) given\n\nbirth to children outside the country. According to the document,\n\nsuch births \"may be determined as illegal birth and shall be dealt\n\nwith in compliance with relevant provisions of the Regulations on\n\nPopulation and Family Planning of Fujian Province.\"               A.R. 37.\n\nSecond, a document from the Family Planning Office of Ting Jiang\n\nTown   (apparently   petitioner's   home   town),   in   answer    to   the\n\nquestion as to \"what contraceptive measure needs to be taken after\n\ngiving birth to two children or more,\" states \"sterilization.\"\n\nA.R. 300.1    Taken together these suggest that a returnee with two\n\n\n       1\n      Zheng also supplies a document from a local city government\nimplementing \"Fujian Province Family Planning Regulations\" which\nstates that \"after the second child has been born, then tubal\nlitigation must be performed.\"      A.R. 71. However, this same\ndocument states that \"[f]or those who refuse to practice birth\ncontrol in the aftermath of persuasion, authorities of all regions\ncan implement necessary administrative and economic penalties.\"\nId. It does not appear to indicate that forced sterilization will\nbe imposed.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fchildren faces sterilization.         Zheng notes that very similar\n\ndocuments were held by the Second Circuit to require a remand to\n\nthe BIA to determine whether they were sufficient to establish a\n\nwell founded fear of persecution. Shou Yung Guo v. Gonzales, 463\n\nF.3d 109, 112-15 (2d Cir. 2006); see also Lin v. Dep't of Justice,\n\n473 F.3d 48, 55 (2d Cir. 2007) (remanding similar case in light\n\nof Shou Yung Guo documents). Zheng urges this court to follow the\n\nSecond Circuit's lead.\n\n              Subsequent events have weakened Zheng's position.       The\n\nSecond Circuit's remand was based on its recognition that the BIA\n\nwas     the   adjudicative   body   best   equipped   to   evaluate   the\n\nsignificance of the Shou Yung Guo documents. Id. at 55.         The BIA,\n\nafter     considering   these   documents,     held   that    they    were\n\ninsufficient to establish a well founded fear of persecution.          In\n\nre S-Y-G, 24 I & N dec. 247 (BIA 2007); see also In re J-W-S, 24\n\nI & N Dec. 185 (considering similar documents). In J-W-S, the BIA\n\nfound that, although the documents do suggest that sterilization\n\nis a policy for those with more than two children, there was no\n\n\"evidence that [the policy] is implemented through physical force\n\nor other means that would amount to persecution.\"            Id. at 192.\n\nMoreover, not only does the Chinese \"central government policy\n\nprohibit[] physical coercion to compel persons to submit to family\n\nplanning enforcement,\" but enforcement efforts in Fujian Province\n\nin particular are \"lax\" and \"uneven.\"        Id. at 193.     In fact, the\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f2006 Country Reports indicates, based on interviews with visa\n\napplicants from Fujian Province, no evidence of forced abortions\n\noccurring there.        Finally, the 2007 State Department Report on\n\nChina refers to a letter from the Fujian Province Population and\n\nFamily Planning Commission which states that \"children born abroad\n\n. . . are not considered permanent residents of China, and\n\ntherefore are not counted against the number of children allowed\n\nunder China's family planning laws.\"              Id.    After evaluating all\n\nthe facts, the BIA concluded that the applicant had not shown a\n\nwell founded fear of persecution.\n\n            In   reviewing      these   cases    after    remand,   the   Second\n\nCircuit    noted   that   the    BIA    had    now   fulfilled    its   duty   by\n\nconsidering the evidence it had failed to consider previously.\n\nShao v. Mukasey, ___ F.3d ___, 2008 WL 4531571 (2d Cir. 2008) at\n\n*28 n.30.    The court also upheld the findings and conclusions of\n\nthe BIA denying petitioners' requests for relief. Id. at *19-*30.\n\n            In sum, the Second Circuit remand was based on its\n\nbelief that the BIA had yet to evaluate the significance of the\n\nShou Yung Guo documents.         The BIA, which the court acknowledged\n\nwas   in   the   best   condition       to    perform    the   evaluation,     has\n\nevaluated the evidence and concluded that the documents are\n\ninsufficient to establish a well founded fear of persecution.\n\nThat conclusion in turn has been upheld by the Second Circuit\n\npanel.     Since Zheng has failed to bring forth any evidence which\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fwould call into question the BIA's determinations in these cases,\n\nwe conclude that she has failed to establish a prima facie case\n\nfor the relief sought.   Therefore, the BIA did not err in denying\n\nthe motion to reopen.\n\n          The petition for judicial review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f",

The strength\n\nof the Aird affidavit is undermined both by the fact that it is\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fnot based on personal knowledge and especially by the fact that\n\nit \"refer[s] to no incidents of forced sterilization of parents\n\nwho return to China with children born abroad.\"          In re J-W-S, 24\n\nI & N Dec. at 190.      Finally, it should be noted that the Aird\n\naffidavit pre-dates Zheng's original BIA decision and hence is not\n\nnew evidence.\n\n             Zheng also relies on two documents from Fujian Province.\n\nThe first is a reply from the State Population and Family Planning\n\nCommission to a question regarding the applicability of family\n\nplanning laws to Chinese citizens who have (like Zheng) given\n\nbirth to children outside the country. According to the document,\n\nsuch births \"may be determined as illegal birth and shall be dealt\n\nwith in compliance with relevant provisions of the Regulations on\n\nPopulation and Family Planning of Fujian Province.\"               A.R. 37.\n\nSecond, a document from the Family Planning Office of Ting Jiang\n\nTown   (apparently   petitioner's   home   town),   in   answer    to   the\n\nquestion as to \"what contraceptive measure needs to be taken after\n\ngiving birth to two children or more,\" states \"sterilization.\"\n\nA.R. 300.1    Taken together these suggest that a returnee with two\n\n\n       1\n      Zheng also supplies a document from a local city government\nimplementing \"Fujian Province Family Planning Regulations\" which\nstates that \"after the second child has been born, then tubal\nlitigation must be performed.\"      A.R. 71. However, this same\ndocument states that \"[f]or those who refuse to practice birth\ncontrol in the aftermath of persuasion, authorities of all regions\ncan implement necessary administrative and economic penalties.\"\nId. It does not appear to indicate that forced sterilization will\nbe imposed.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fchildren faces sterilization.         Zheng notes that very similar\n\ndocuments were held by the Second Circuit to require a remand to\n\nthe BIA to determine whether they were sufficient to establish a\n\nwell founded fear of persecution.

Zheng urges this court to follow the\n\nSecond Circuit's lead.\n\n              Subsequent events have weakened Zheng's position.       The\n\nSecond Circuit's remand was based on its recognition that the BIA\n\nwas     the   adjudicative   body   best   equipped   to   evaluate   the\n\nsignificance of the Shou Yung Guo documents. Id. at 55.         The BIA,\n\nafter     considering   these   documents,     held   that    they    were\n\ninsufficient to establish a well founded fear of persecution.          In\n\nre S-Y-G, 24 I & N dec. 247 (BIA 2007); see also In re J-W-S, 24\n\nI & N Dec. 185 (considering similar documents). In J-W-S, the BIA\n\nfound that, although the documents do suggest that sterilization\n\nis a policy for those with more than two children, there was no\n\n\"evidence that [the policy] is implemented through physical force\n\nor other means that would amount to persecution.\"            Id. at 192.\n\nMoreover, not only does the Chinese \"central government policy\n\nprohibit[] physical coercion to compel persons to submit to family\n\nplanning enforcement,\" but enforcement efforts in Fujian Province\n\nin particular are \"lax\" and \"uneven.\"        Id. at 193.     In fact, the\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f2006 Country Reports indicates, based on interviews with visa\n\napplicants from Fujian Province, no evidence of forced abortions\n\noccurring there.        Finally, the 2007 State Department Report on\n\nChina refers to a letter from the Fujian Province Population and\n\nFamily Planning Commission which states that \"children born abroad\n\n. . . are not considered permanent residents of China, and\n\ntherefore are not counted against the number of children allowed\n\nunder China's family planning laws.\"              Id.    After evaluating all\n\nthe facts, the BIA concluded that the applicant had not shown a\n\nwell founded fear of persecution.\n\n            In   reviewing      these   cases    after    remand,   the   Second\n\nCircuit    noted   that   the    BIA    had    now   fulfilled    its   duty   by\n\nconsidering the evidence it had failed to consider previously.\n\nShao v.

The court also upheld the findings and conclusions of\n\nthe BIA denying petitioners' requests for relief. Id. at *19-*30.\n\n            In sum, the Second Circuit remand was based on its\n\nbelief that the BIA had yet to evaluate the significance of the\n\nShou Yung Guo documents.         The BIA, which the court acknowledged\n\nwas   in   the   best   condition       to    perform    the   evaluation,     has\n\nevaluated the evidence and concluded that the documents are\n\ninsufficient to establish a well founded fear of persecution.\n\nThat conclusion in turn has been upheld by the Second Circuit\n\npanel.     Since Zheng has failed to bring forth any evidence which\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fwould call into question the BIA's determinations in these cases,\n\nwe conclude that she has failed to establish a prima facie case\n\nfor the relief sought.   Therefore, the BIA did not err in denying\n\nthe motion to reopen.\n\n          The petition for judicial review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\f</pre>",
