Oliveras López De Victoria on brief for appellant.\n     Martha L Martínez Rodríguez, and Manuel A. Núñez Law Offices\non brief for appellee the Puerto Rico Ports Authority.\n     Maite D. Oronoz-Rodriguez, Acting Solicitor General, and Irene\nS. Soroeta-Kodesh, Assistant Solicitor General, on brief for\nappellees Israel Ortiz-De-Jesús and Manuel Villazàn-Ling-Long.\n\n\n                              October 16, 2008\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.\n\f           Schwarzer, District Judge, Plaintiffs Roberto Meléndez-\n\nSantana and his wife Jessica González-Ortiz appeal the district\n\ncourt’s summary judgment for the defendants, the Puerto Rico Ports\n\nAuthority (“PRPA”), Israel Ortiz-de-Jesús, and Manuel Villazán-\n\nLing-Long, dismissing Meléndez-Santana’s action for violation of\n\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et\n\nseq., and for breach of contract.       Because Meléndez-Santana has\n\nfailed to establish that he was a qualified individual under the\n\nADA, or that the contract claim is properly before us, we affirm\n\nthe judgment of the district court.\n\n\n\n                  I. Factual and Procedural History\n\n           The material facts are undisputed. Mr. Meléndez-Santana\n\nbegan working for the PRPA in 1993 as a security supervisor.        From\n\n1994 to 1998, he served as an assistant and bodyguard to the\n\nExecutive Director of the PRPA.       In 1998, Meléndez-Santana was\n\ntransferred to the International Airport where he again served as\n\na   security   supervisor.   The   essential   duties   of   a   security\n\nsupervisor include regular contact with the public and other\n\nemployees, as well as: (i) inspection of all services rendered by\n\nguards and other employees in the security area; (ii) periodic\n\ninspections of security areas; (iii) enforcing the security rules\n\n                                - 2 -\n\fand recommending necessary measures; and (iv) communicating with\n\ndifferent security areas, local police and federal authorities.\n\nAfter   the    terrorist   attacks   on   September       11,    2001,    security\n\nprocedures at the airport were altered, and employees were required\n\nto work extended rotating shifts that included night duty.                      In\n\nFebruary 2002, Meléndez-Santana requested reassignment because the\n\nnight time shifts were difficult for him.             He was transferred to\n\nthe   Maritime    Division   effective       June   10,    2002,    but    he   was\n\ndissatisfied with the new assignment because it involved similar\n\nduties and hours.\n\n              In July 2002, Meléndez-Santana’s doctor certified that he\n\nwas unable to work due to severe depression and anxiety that\n\nlimited his concentration and made him unstable and aggressive. He\n\nwent on leave for approximately ten months.               During that time, in\n\nSeptember 2002, he applied for Social Security Disability Insurance\n\nbenefits, claiming total disability.\n\n              Meléndez-Santana   returned      to   work    on     May   5,   2003,\n\nreporting to the Maritime Division.          He brought a certificate from\n\nhis family doctor dated May 1, 2003, stating that he could not work\n\nrotating night time shifts, and could not work in security. He\n\nrequested changes in his duties as a reasonable accommodation based\n\non his condition, in accordance with PRPA procedures.                     The PRPA\n\n                                     - 3 -\n\freferred him for medical evaluation to determine if he was eligible\n\nfor a reasonable accommodation and temporarily assigned him to work\n\nas a security supervisor in the PRPA’s main office until the\n\nevaluation process was completed.              This position required only day\n\nshifts, and consisted of lighter duties than his job in the\n\nMaritime Division.\n\n              On May 14, 2003, Dr. López Cumpiano, a psychiatrist,\n\nexamined     Meléndez-Santana       in     the     course   of     the        reasonable\n\naccommodation evaluation process.                 In his report, Dr. Cumpiano\n\nconcluded that Meléndez-Santana still suffered from mental illness\n\nand was not able to perform any of the essential duties of his job,\n\nwith or without accommodation.            This report was sent to the PRPA on\n\nJune 3, 2003.\n\n             On June 2, 2003, Meléndez-Santana got into an argument\n\nwith   his   supervisor,      Manuel      Villazàn-Ling-Long,           who     informed\n\nMeléndez-Santana      that    he   was    no     longer   assigned       to    the   PRPA\n\nheadquarters.     When he was ordered to report to the San Juan Harbor\n\nto begin a rotating shift that initially would go from 2:00 to\n\n10:30 pm, he became very upset.           He felt that the night time shifts\n\naggravated     his   mental   illness      and     prevented      him    from     taking\n\nsleeping     medication   prescribed       by     his   doctor.         He    left   PRPA\n\n\n\n                                         - 4 -\n\fheadquarters, did not report that evening to the Harbor, and did\n\nnot return to work at the PRPA.\n\n            On December 1, 2004, he filed this action in the district\n\ncourt alleging violations of the ADA and Title VII of the Civil\n\nRights Act of 1964, and various state law claims.                   On January 22,\n\n2007, the district court granted summary judgment to the defendants\n\non the ADA claim, dismissed the Title VII claim sua sponte under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and declined to exercise supplemental\n\njurisdiction     over   the   state   law     claims.        This    timely   appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n\n                               II.    Discussion\n\n                 A.   The Americans with Disabilities Act\n\n            We   review   a   summary    judgment       de    novo    drawing    all\n\nreasonable inferences in favor of the non-moving party.                   Thompson\n\nv. Coca-Cola Co. 522 F.3d 168, 175 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            The district court found that Meléndez-Santana failed to\n\nestablish a prima facie case of disability discrimination under the\n\nADA. To make out a prima facie case, Meléndez-Santana had to prove\n\n1) that he suffered from a disability within the meaning of the\n\nADA; 2) that he could nonetheless perform the essential functions\n\nof the job with or without reasonable accommodation; and 3) that\n\n                                      - 5 -\n\fhis employer discharged or took an adverse employment action\n\nagainst him in whole or in part because of his disability.   Orta-\n\nCastro v. Merck, Sharp & Dohme Química P.R., Inc. 447 F.3d 105, 111\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).   The district court found that Meléndez-Santana\n\nsuffered a disability within the meaning of the ADA, and that\n\nfinding is not in dispute. The district court concluded, however,\n\nthat he was not a qualified individual under the ADA because he did\n\nnot establish that he was able to perform the essential functions\n\nof the job even with reasonable accommodation.\n\n          Upon Meléndez-Santana's return to work in May 2003 after\n\nhis ten-month medical leave and in the course of the reasonable\n\naccommodation evaluation process, he was examined by Dr. López\n\nCumpiano, the designated examiner.    Dr. López Cumpiano determined\n\nthat Meléndez-Santana was unable to perform any task with or\n\nwithout accommodation.   His report was forwarded to the Social\n\nSecurity Administration, which determined that Meléndez-Santana was\n\nunable to perform the duties of his position or any other job and\n\ngranted him Social Security Disability Insurance benefits.\n\n           Meléndez-Santana has offered no evidence that calls into\n\nquestion the finding of total disability.    Moreover, his receipt\n\nof Social Security Disability Insurance benefits placed on him the\n\nburden of proffering a sufficient explanation for the contradiction\n\n                              - 6 -\n\fbetween his total disability claim and his ADA claim which would\n\nallow a reasonable jury to conclude that the plaintiff could\n\nperform   the   essential   functions    of   his   job   with   or   without\n\naccommodation.    Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys., 526 U.S. 795, 807\n\n(1999). No such explanation has been offered.\n\n           Because the undisputed evidence shows that Meléndez-\n\nSantana is not able to perform the essential functions of his job\n\nwith or without accommodation, he has failed to establish a prima\n\nfacie case under the ADA. Summary judgment was properly granted on\n\nthe ADA claim.\n\n\n\n                     B.   Breach of Contract Claim\n\n           For the first time on appeal, Meléndez-Santana asserts\n\na claim that PRPA breached a reasonable accommodation agreement, a\n\nclaim neither pleaded in the complaint nor raised in the court\n\nbelow. \"Under the familiar raise-or-waive rule, legal theories not\n\nasserted in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time\n\non appeal.\"      Goodwin v. C.N.J., Inc.,436 F3d 44, 51 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n           Even were we to consider this claim, it is clear that\n\nwhen Meléndez-Santana returned to work on May 5, his assignment to\n\nwork as safety supervisor at the Main Office was only temporary,\n\n                                 - 7 -\n\fwhile his request for reasonable accommodation was being evaluated.\n\nThere is no evidence of any agreement between him and PRPA to\n\nprovide a reasonable accommodation.\n\n\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                              - 8 -\n\f",

No such explanation has been offered.\n\n           Because the undisputed evidence shows that Meléndez-\n\nSantana is not able to perform the essential functions of his job\n\nwith or without accommodation, he has failed to establish a prima\n\nfacie case under the ADA. Summary judgment was properly granted on\n\nthe ADA claim.\n\n\n\n                     B.   Breach of Contract Claim\n\n           For the first time on appeal, Meléndez-Santana asserts\n\na claim that PRPA breached a reasonable accommodation agreement, a\n\nclaim neither pleaded in the complaint nor raised in the court\n\nbelow. \"Under the familiar raise-or-waive rule, legal theories not\n\nasserted in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time\n\non appeal.\"      Goodwin v. C.N.J., Inc.,436 F3d 44, 51 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n           Even were we to consider this claim, it is clear that\n\nwhen Meléndez-Santana returned to work on May 5, his assignment to\n\nwork as safety supervisor at the Main Office was only temporary,\n\n                                 - 7 -\n\fwhile his request for reasonable accommodation was being evaluated.\n\nThere is no evidence of any agreement between him and PRPA to\n\nprovide a reasonable accommodation.\n\n\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                              - 8 -\n\f</pre>",
