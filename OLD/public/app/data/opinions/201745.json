Zaleskas and Choate, Hall & Stewart LLP were on\nconsolidated brief for appellee.\n\n\n                            August 4, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Tenth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f              BOUDIN, Chief Judge.         This commercial dispute, more\n\ncomplicated than difficult, concerns a claim made on a surety bond\n\nissued by one insurer to another.             The district court granted\n\nrecovery on the bond in favor of the claimant, Liberty Mutual\n\nInsurance Company (“Liberty”), and against the issuer of the bond,\n\nGreenwich Insurance Company (“Greenwich”). Greenwich has appealed,\n\nand we now affirm.\n\n              The scene is easily set.        In December 1999, American\n\nTissue, Inc. (“American Tissue”), a manufacturer now bankrupt,\n\nobtained from Liberty two insurance policies to cover workers’\n\ncompensation that American Tissue might be forced to pay in the\n\ncourse   of    its   ordinary   operations.     The   policies   (“the   1999\n\npolicies”) were to cover accidents occurring during the period\n\nDecember 11, 1999-January 1, 2001, and provided coverage for\n\nAmerican Tissue for amounts that it might owe for such accidents\n\nover and above a deductible of $250,000 for each claim.\n\n              These policies    were “fronting policies,” providing that\n\nLiberty would pay all claims in their entirety up front and that\n\nAmerican would reimburse Liberty for any amount paid on the claim\n\nup to the deductible; payments over and above the deductible were\n\nto be borne by Liberty. The policies also required American Tissue\n\nto pay premiums, but the total amount of the premiums was to be\n\nadjusted retrospectively based, among other things, on actual\n\nlosses experienced by Liberty.         The policies thus provided some\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fprotection for American Tissue but greater protection for injured\n\nworkers.\n\n           During   the   year   2000,   American   Tissue   encountered\n\nfinancial difficulties and failed to make required payments to\n\nLiberty.   So, as a condition of renewing the policies, Liberty\n\ninsisted that American Tissue obtain guarantees to secure American\n\nTissue’s present and future obligations to reimburse Liberty.        On\n\nDecember 11, 2000, the two companies signed an agreement to this\n\neffect (“the agreement”) and Liberty then renewed American Tissue’s\n\npolicies for the period January 1, 2001, to January 1, 2002 (“the\n\n2001 policies”).\n\n           The agreement, which is at the center of the dispute,\n\nsaid that its purpose was to secure all of American Tissue’s\n\nobligations to Liberty arising out of the 1999 and 2001 policies,\n\nincluding both reimbursements and premiums, and provided that\n\npayments due must be paid within 20 days of Liberty’s written\n\ndemand.    To secure these payments, American Tissue agreed to\n\ndeliver both a surety bond and a letter of credit in favor of\n\nLiberty, substantially in the form of the bond and letter of credit\n\nattached to the agreement.\n\n           The agreement provided that the amounts of the required\n\nbond and letter of credit would be fixed by schedules prepared by\n\nLiberty; but it also provided that Liberty “at its sole discretion”\n\ncould increase the amounts by providing American Tissue revised\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fschedules, whenever Liberty feared that the existing amounts so\n\nguaranteed were inadequate to cover American Tissue’s existing\n\nobligations.\n\n              Initially, Liberty sought a surety bond of $1,777,500\n\nand a letter of credit of $2,172,500; however, American Tissue was\n\nunable   to    immediately       supply     so    large    a   letter   of   credit.\n\nAccordingly, Liberty agreed to a bond in the amount of $3.7 million\n\nand a $250,000 letter of credit, provided that American Tissue\n\nthereafter increase the letter to reach $2,172,500 by April 15,\n\n2001.    The collateral-amount schedule read:\n\n              Letter of Credit $250,000 to be increased to\n              $2,172,500 no later than 4/15/2001\n\n              Surety Bond $3,700,000 may be decreased to\n              $1,777,500 on receipt of Letter(s) of Credit\n              totaling $2,172,500\n\nIn the final agreement, the deadline for supplementing the letter\n\nof credit was changed to June 1, 2001.\n\n              On   January   24,    2001,       American   Tissue     obtained   the\n\nrequired $3.7 million surety bond from Greenwich.                   In the archaic\n\nform sometimes used for surety bonds, the bond read that it would\n\nbe void if American Tissue carried out its obligations under its\n\nagreement      with   Liberty      but    “otherwise”      American     Tissue   and\n\nGreenwich were each jointly and severally liable in the amount of\n\nthe   bond.        Separately,     American       Tissue   agreed     to   indemnify\n\nGreenwich for any payments that Greenwich had to make to Liberty\n\nunder the bond.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f          Having obtained an initial letter of credit for $250,000\n\non February 12, 2001, American Tissue on May 16, 2001, obtained an\n\nadditional letter of credit for $2,172,500.       Not long after,\n\nAmerican Tissue sent an e-mail to Marsh & McLennan requesting that\n\nthe surety bond be reduced to $1,777,500 in accordance with the\n\nagreement.1   Marsh & McLennan forwarded the request to Greenwich,\n\nwhich responded that the bond reduction \"can be done by rider, but\n\nit must be acknowledged by the carrier\"–-apparently meaning that\n\nLiberty must be notified first.\n\n          In all events, there is no evidence that Liberty was\n\nitself notified, or that it consented to a bond reduction, or that\n\nthe bond amount was in fact ever reduced.2    Instead, during 2001\n\nAmerican Tissue began to miss payments to Liberty and, on July 13,\n\n2001, Liberty issued a new schedule raising (without qualification)\n\nthe required security to $2,422,500 in letters of credit (the value\n\nof the two existing letters) and $3.7 million for the surety bond.\n\nThereafter, to satisfy some of American Tissue’s debt, Liberty drew\n\ndown almost in full both existing letters of credit.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The writer of the original e-mail may have assumed that Marsh\n& McLennan was Liberty’s agent; this Liberty disputes, suggesting\nthat Marsh & McLennan was acting as broker for American Tissue.\n     2\n      In the law suit, the district court did not permit discovery\nabout what happened, but Greenwich–-which presumably would know if\nit reduced the bond–-does not claim the denial of discovery on this\nissue to be error.\n\n                                  -5-\n\f               On August 17, 2001, and again on September 7, Liberty\n\nnotified American Tissue that the latter was in default under the\n\nagreement on account of continued non-payments.                   On September 10,\n\n2001, American Tissue filed for bankruptcy in Delaware. On October\n\n9,   Liberty     wrote   to    Greenwich,      claiming    that    the    bankruptcy\n\nconstituted      a   default     under   the    agreement       and   bond,   making\n\nGreenwich liable for the full amount of the bond ($3.7 million),\n\nwhich Liberty now asserts is less than the estimated loss that\n\nLiberty is going to suffer from American Tissue’s default.\n\n               On Greenwich’s refusal to pay, Liberty on January 29,\n\n2002, filed a two-count complaint against Greenwich in the federal\n\ndistrict court. The first count (which alone is before us) claimed\n\nbreach of contract for non-payment of the full amount of the bond.\n\nIn due course, the district court granted summary judgment in\n\nLiberty’s favor and certified this judgment as separate and final\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 54(b).                (Still unresolved, and not\n\nbefore us, are a claim by Liberty under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A\n\n(2002)    and     counterclaims     by   Greenwich        on    several   different\n\ntheories.)\n\n               On appeal, Greenwich’s first and most extensive argument\n\nis on the merits of Liberty's contract claim.                  Its position is that\n\nunder    the    surety   bond,    incorporating      relevant         terms   of   the\n\nagreement between Liberty and American Tissue, it can be liable to\n\nLiberty only for the amount of $1,777,500–-the sum to which the\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fagreement permitted American Tissue to reduce the bond once it had\n\nsecured letters of credit totaling $2,172,500.       Alternatively,\n\nGreenwich says that at least the bond and agreement were ambiguous,\n\npresenting an issue of fact precluding summary judgment.\n\n          The agreement provides explicitly that its terms are\n\ngoverned by Massachusetts law; the surety bond is silent but here\n\nthe parties cite Massachusetts law as well and we accept their\n\nimplicit premise.     See McAdams v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 391\n\nF.3d 287, 298 n.5 (1st Cir. 2004).     The grant of summary judgment\n\nis reviewed de novo, Dasey v. Anderson, 304 F.3d 148, 153 (1st Cir.\n\n2002); and ordinarily contract interpretation is for the court\n\nunless disputed issues of fact bear upon the interpretation of\n\nambiguous language.    Fishman v. LaSalle Nat’l Bank, 247 F.3d 300,\n\n303 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n          In our view–-and this too is a question of law for the\n\ncourt, Lanier Prof’l Servs., Inc. v. Ricci, 192 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.\n\n1999)–-neither the bond nor the agreement is ambiguous in any way\n\nrelevant here.   By its terms, the full amount of the bond is\n\npayable upon an act of default by American Tissue, and Greenwich\n\ndoes not deny that such a default occurred.      Nor does Greenwich\n\nclaim that it did issue a substitute bond in an amount smaller than\n\n$3,700,000 or otherwise issue any rider reducing the amount of the\n\nbond.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f          Rather,   Greenwich   argues   in   substance   that   American\n\nTissue had a right, after furnishing the second letter of credit,\n\nto reduce the bond to $1,777,500, that it took steps to do so, and\n\nthat the mechanics of the reduction even if not achieved were a\n\nmere “ministerial act.”     It then argues that the reduction should\n\nbe treated as automatic or as accomplished by the steps taken, that\n\nthe reduction would carry out the intent of the parties, and that\n\nfailing to reduce the amount would reward Liberty for withholding\n\nconsent that it was required to provide.\n\n          There is nothing to these arguments.      We will assume, as\n\nGreenwich urges, that the bond should be read in conjunction with\n\nthe underlying agreement which permitted American Tissue to have\n\nGreenwich reduce the amount of the bond to $1,777,500.           But the\n\nagreement said that American Tissue “may” reduce the amount; it did\n\nnot say that it had to do so or that the reduction would be\n\nautomatic.     American Tissue started the steps to accomplish a\n\nreduction but did not complete them.\n\n          Neither American Tissue nor Greenwich acted as if a\n\nreduction were automatic.    American Tissue made a specific request\n\nfor a reduction; Greenwich countered that notice to Liberty would\n\nbe required.    The bond provided that it could not be cancelled\n\nwithout 60 days advance notice to Liberty.           Had Greenwich or\n\nAmerican Tissue proposed such a reduction to Liberty in mid-2001,\n\nLiberty could have raised the amount of security that it was\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fentitled to demand.           By mid-2001, American Tissue was missing\n\npayments and Liberty did in fact re-schedule the security required\n\nto set the bond amount at $3,700,000, bringing the total security\n\namount required to $6,122,500.\n\n            Under both case law and general usage, the term “may”\n\nusually indicates that something is permissive, not mandatory or\n\nautomatic.3    Yes, in rare situations, it can be read differently,\n\ncf. In re Ionosphere Clubs, Inc., 111 B.R. 436, 441 (Bankr.\n\nS.D.N.Y. 1990); but here the agreement taken as a whole–-both in\n\nlanguage and purpose–-gave American Tissue a right to insist on a\n\nreduction     but    also    allowed       Liberty   to   counter   a   threatened\n\nreduction by amending the schedule upward.\n\n            This does not make the downsizing option meaningless.\n\nAmerican    Tissue     did    have     a    unilateral     option-–albeit    never\n\neffectively exercised–-to insist on a reduction in the bond amount\n\nafter posting the new letter of credit, unless Liberty increased\n\nthe   security      required.     The       agreement     gave   Liberty   absolute\n\ndiscretion, but if Liberty had increased the security schedule, in\n\nbad faith (say, because the existing security was and would remain\n\npatently adequate), it might well not have prevailed. See F.D.I.C.\n\nv. LeBlanc, 85 F.3d 815, 819 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n\n\n      3\n      See, e.g., Middlesex County v. Middlesex County Advisory Bd.,\n658 N.E.2d 674, 677 (Mass. 1995); Cohen v. Bd. of Water Comm’rs,\n585 N.E.2d 737, 742 (Mass. 1992); Hampden Trust Co. v. Leary, 72\nN.E. 88, 89 (Mass. 1904).\n\n                                           -9-\n\f          Greenwich’s contract argument requires little further\n\ndiscussion.   There   is   no   evidence   that   the   parties   intended\n\nanything but what happened-–so much for citations to reformation\n\ndoctrine, see Polaroid Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Co., 610 N.E.2d\n\n912, 917 (Mass. 1993)-–and the equity maxim (that equity will treat\n\nas done that which ought to be done, see In re Cumberland Farms,\n\nInc., 249 B.R. 341, 355-56 (Bankr. D. Mass. 2000)), is inapt where,\n\nas here, the thing allegedly to be done (a reduction in the bond)\n\nwas subject to being legitimately countered by an increase in the\n\nrequired security.\n\n          This brings us to Greenwich’s other arguments which,\n\nalthough briefly presented, are more interesting.        The first turns\n\non a provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. § 365(e)(1)\n\n(2000), popularly known as the ipso facto clause.           Pertinently,\n\nthis section prevents an executory contract or lease from being\n\nautomatically terminated or modified by virtue of the other party’s\n\nfiling for bankruptcy.     The aim is to protect the right of the\n\nbankruptcy estate to adopt, reaffirm and continue a contract or\n\nlease where this will serve the estate's interests.\n\n          In this case, the filing for bankruptcy by American\n\nTissue was an act of default under the terms of the agreement\n\nbetween Liberty and American Tissue, and it was explicitly invoked\n\nby Liberty as the basis for its claim against the bond.       Greenwich,\n\nnoting that both it and American Tissue were liable under the bond,\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fsays that Greenwich itself is entitled to invoke section 365(e)(1)\n\nas to any claim against it.     The district court disagreed, holding\n\nthat the ipso facto clause is intended to protect a bankruptcy\n\ndebtor, not a third party like Greenwich.\n\n            There is a surprising paucity of precedent.       A few lower\n\ncourt decisions favor the district court's view; one points the\n\nother way.4     However, a careful reading of the statute and an\n\nunderstanding    of   its   purpose   readily   confirm    that-–whatever\n\nprotection the statute may give American Tissue in protecting its\n\nown rights vis-à-vis Liberty under the agreement–-the statute in no\n\nway invalidates a separate claim by Liberty against Greenwich under\n\nthe bond.\n\n            We begin with statutory language, as is normally proper.\n\nUnited States v. Tapia-Escalera, 356 F.3d 181, 185 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nGreenwich correctly notes that section 365(e)(1) does not by its\n\nterms say that only the bankrupt can invoke it.           But the statute\n\nalso says that what may not be terminated or modified by bankruptcy\n\nis “an executory contract or unexpired lease of the debtor” or “any\n\nright or obligation under such contract or lease.”         This is strong\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Compare Chrysler Fin. Corp. v. Fruit of the Loom, Inc., No.\n91C-08-108-1-CV, 1993 WL 19659, *4 (Del. Super. Ct. Jan. 12, 1993)\n(unpublished decision); In re Prime Motor Inns, Inc., 130 B.R. 610,\n613 (S.D. Fla. 1991); In re Zenith Laboratories, Inc., 104 B.R.\n667, 672 (Bankr. D.N.J. 1989), with In re Metrobility Optical Sys.,\nInc., 268 B.R. 326, 329 (Bankr. D.N.H. 2001).\n\n                                  -11-\n\flinguistic    evidence   that   Congress   was   concerned   with   clauses\n\ndiluting the bankrupt’s interests-–not interests of a third party.\n\n          The same result follows when one considers the purpose of\n\nthe section.    This purpose--avowed in both legislative history and\n\ncase law–-is to protect the bankruptcy estate, primarily against\n\nthe loss of contractual rights that the estate might choose to\n\nassume and reaffirm.5      Holding Greenwich liable does not modify\n\nrights of the American Tissue estate against Liberty or prevent the\n\nestate from reaffirming any contractual rights it may have under\n\nits policies with Liberty.\n\n          The parties choose to talk of the matter as if it is a\n\nquestion of standing, namely, who is entitled to invoke section\n\n365(e)(1).    We do not so view the problem or say that a third party\n\ncan never rely on the section.      Rather, our holding here rests on\n\nthe proposition that the district court adjudicated in this case\n\nonly a contract claim by Liberty against Greenwich.          The bond is an\n\nindependent obligation of Greenwich which happens to have been\n\ntriggered by a third party’s non-payments of debts and resort to\n\nbankruptcy.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      See S. Rep. No. 95-989 at 59 (1978), reprinted in 1978\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 5787, 5845; H.R. Rep. No. 95-595 at 348 (1978),\nreprinted in 1978 U.S.C.C.A.N. 5963, 6304-05; City of Covington v.\nCovington Landing Ltd.

M.D. Fla. 1999).\n\n                                   -12-\n\f           It is beside the point that American Tissue may be a co-\n\nguarantor under the bond and might have a defense if sued itself.\n\nIf two persons are jointly and severally liable on a contract, the\n\nfact that one has a defense (e.g., because underaged when the\n\ncontract was signed) does not automatically protect the other\n\nagainst suit for nonperformance. See Dexter v. Blanchard, 93 Mass.\n\n(11 Allen) 365 (1865).        This is not a case where a principal's\n\nobligation under the surety contract is \"void.\"            2 Farnsworth on\n\nContracts § 6.3 at 118 (3d ed. 2004).\n\n           Certainly as a result of paying Liberty the full amount\n\nof the bond, Greenwich will have an enlarged claim against the\n\nAmerican Tissue estate under its indemnity agreement with American\n\nTissue.   But every increase in the estate’s debt to Greenwich will\n\nlikely be offset by a reduced debt of the estate to Liberty.            That\n\nGreenwich chose, for the bond premium, to protect Liberty by\n\nrisking the loss itself does not appear to have any visible effect\n\non the estate’s net obligations.\n\n           As   its   third   distinct    objection   to    the   judgment,\n\nGreenwich says that the bond makes it liable upon the default to\n\npay the full amount of the bond regardless of the actual damages to\n\nLiberty and that this invalidates the bond under Massachusetts law\n\nas   an   improper    penalty.    In     Massachusetts,     as    in   other\n\njurisdictions, a liquidated damages clause is not allowed where\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fdamages can readily be ascertained. See A-Z Servicenter, Inc. v.\n\nSegall, 138 N.E.2d 266, 268 (Mass. 1956).\n\n            Possibly     seeking   to     thwart   this   objection,   Liberty\n\noffered to return to Greenwich any portion of the bond amount that\n\nwas not needed to cover existing or potential liability of American\n\nTissue to Liberty.       If this was a gratuitous offer by Liberty, it\n\nwould not defeat an objection to the bond under Massachusetts law;\n\nit is a different question whether the commitment could be taken as\n\na proper reading of the bond--which has language pointing both\n\nways--but we need not decide it because the bond is independently\n\nvalid, even if the face value is payable.\n\n            Under Massachusetts law, a fixed sum specified in advance\n\nas contract damages is normally sustained if actual damages are\n\ndifficult to ascertain in advance;6 if this condition is not met,\n\nor   if   the   amount   specified   is    grossly   disproportionate    to   a\n\nreasonable estimate, enforcement is denied. See Kelly v. Marx, 705\n\n\n\n      6\n      Where “actual damages are difficult to ascertain” and where\n“the sum agreed upon by the parties at the time of the execution of\nthe contract represents a reasonable estimate of the actual\ndamages,” a contract clause specifying liquidated damages will be\nenforced.   Kelly v. Marx, 705 N.E.2d 1114, 1116 (Mass. 1999)\n(quoting A-Z Servicenter, Inc. v. Segall, 138 N.E.2d 266, 268\n(Mass. 1956)) (internal quotations omitted); Shawmut-Canton LLC v.\nGreat Spring Waters of Am., Inc., 816 N.E.2d 545, 553 (Mass. App.\nCt. 2004).   Kelly rejected the so-called “second-look” approach\nwhich also measures the liquidated damages “against the actual\ndamages resulting from breach.”      Kelly, 705 N.E.2d at 1116.\nInstead, “a judge, in determining the enforceability of a\nliquidated damages clause, should examine only the circumstances at\ncontract formation.” Id.\n\n                                     -14-\n\fN.E.2d 1114, 1116 (Mass. 1999).    This is Massachusetts law, so it\n\ndoes not matter whether it is viewed as an antique impairment of\n\nfreedom of contract or a healthy protection against improvident\n\nbargains.\n\n            Greenwich argues that it is easy to ascertain how much\n\nAmerican Tissue owes to Liberty, because as of any specific date\n\nthere may be unpaid premiums and unpaid reimbursements due under\n\nthe policies; but these, says Greenwich, can easily be calculated.\n\nFurther, it suggests, the amounts currently due are far less than\n\nthe full amount that Liberty is claiming under the bond.       Both\n\narguments are misleading, mainly because Greenwich is understating\n\nthe scope of the damage to Liberty.\n\n            The Liberty policies already described committed Liberty\n\nto make workers’ compensation payments for accidents occurring\n\nwithin the period covered by the policies.   Such claims may entail\n\npayments to be made over many years following an accident and for\n\nperiods (which may depend on changes in the victim’s condition or\n\nstatus) that cannot be ascertained at the time of an initial award\n\nof compensation. See 7 Larson’s Workers’ Compensation Law § 126\n\n(2000) (describing notice and claim periods).\n\n            Thus, Liberty’s claims against American Tissue under the\n\npolicies were unknown and, except by actuarial estimate, unknowable\n\nat the time that it entered into the policies and secured the bond.\n\nThis is so both as to reimbursements Liberty would be entitled to\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fon claims not yet even made and as to premium recomputations based\n\non actual claims experience.   As it happens, although not required\n\nunder Kelly v. Marx, even now the final toll is probably still\n\nunknowable.\n\n           The district court found that Liberty, when setting the\n\nsecurity originally required, reasonably estimated the damages it\n\nwould incur.   Indeed, when Liberty later increased its security\n\ndemand, the record shows that Liberty extrapolated from claims\n\nhistory and data pertaining to similar insureds.   Whether it used\n\nthe same method in originally setting the security is unclear but\n\nGreenwich does not challenge the finding that the estimate was\n\nreasonable.\n\n           The district court awarded Liberty just over $1 million\n\nin prejudgment interest from the date of Liberty’s pre-suit demand\n\nupon the bond on October 9, 2001, until the entry of judgment on\n\nAugust 17, 2004. Greenwich’s final claim on appeal is that Liberty\n\nis not entitled to such prejudgment interest under Massachusetts\n\nlaw.   The relevant governing statute is Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231\n\n§ 6C (2002), which provides:\n\n           In   all   actions    based   on   contractual\n           obligations, upon a verdict, finding or order\n           for pecuniary damages, interest shall be added\n           by the clerk of the court to the amount of\n           damages, at the contract rate, if established,\n           or at the rate of twelve per cent per annum\n           from the date of the breach or demand.\n\n\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f          Greenwich argues that because the bond was issued as\n\nsecurity for the payment obligations of American Tissue, Liberty\n\ncould not sustain any loss or “pecuniary damages” under the terms\n\nof the statute except by proving specific past payments that\n\nAmerican Tissue had failed to make.   There were missed payments,\n\nbut the district court did not compute interest on that basis; the\n\nliability was based on the face amount of the bond as liquidated\n\ndamages for the estimated aggregate of missed payments past and\n\nfuture.   The district court’s reading of the statute was correct.\n\n          The evident thrust of the statute is to compensate a\n\ncontract claimant for the deprivation of amounts due under a\n\ncontract from the time they were payable to the time at which\n\njudgment is entered;7 thereafter, if there is any delay in paying\n\nthe judgment, separate post-judgment interest is due. The district\n\ncourt found that the full bond amount was due at the time of the\n\ndemand.   So both the terms of the statute and the underlying\n\npurpose-–to cover loss of the use of the money during litigation-\n\n–justify the award.\n\n          Greenwich cites Sterilite Corp. v. Continental Cas. Co.,\n\n494 N.E.2d 1008 (Mass. 1986), for the proposition that the interest\n\n\n     7\n      “An award of interest is made ‘so that a person wrongfully\ndeprived of the use of money should be made whole for his loss.’”\nSterilite Corp. v. Continental Cas. Co., 494 N.E.2d 1008, 1011\n(Mass. 1986) (quoting Perkins Sch. for the Blind v. Rate Setting\nComm’n, 423 N.E.2d 765, 772 (Mass. 1981)); see also Interstate\nBrands Corp. v. Lily Transp. Corp., 256 F. Supp. 2d 58, 62 (D.\nMass. 2003).\n\n                               -17-\n\fstatute is not meant to confer a windfall but instead “is designed\n\nto compensate a damaged party for the loss of use or unlawful\n\ndetention of money.”   Id. at 1011.   Passing the question whether\n\nthe statutory interest is too generous–-which is a legislative\n\njudgment–-the interest in this case is not a windfall; it directly\n\nand accurately compensates Liberty for being deprived of its\n\ncontractual right to possess and use the $3.7 million from October\n\n9, 2001, to the date of judgment.\n\n          Disola Dev., LLC v. Mancuso, 291 F.3d 83 (1st Cir. 2002),\n\nprincipally relied upon by Greenwich, is a distinguishable case of\n\nunusual, and unusually confusing, facts.   It is enough to say that\n\nthe amount on which the court declined to award interest under the\n\nMassachusetts statute was a frozen bank account and not a sum\n\ncontractually due to the victor, and that the court interpreted a\n\ncompanion jury verdict for the victor as covering the time-value of\n\nthe money frozen in the account during the litigation.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -18-\n\f",

The district court granted recovery on the bond in favor of the claimant, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\"Liberty\"), and against the issuer of the bond, Greenwich Insurance Company (\"Greenwich\"). Greenwich has appealed, and we now affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scene is easily set. In December 1999, American Tissue, Inc. (\"American Tissue\"), a manufacturer now bankrupt, obtained from Liberty two insurance policies to cover workers' compensation that American Tissue might be forced to pay in the course of its ordinary operations. The policies (\"the 1999 policies\") were to cover accidents occurring during the period December 11, 1999-January 1, 2001, and provided coverage for American Tissue for amounts that it might owe for such accidents over and above a deductible of $250,000 for each claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These policies were \"fronting policies,\" providing that Liberty would pay all claims in their entirety up front and that American would reimburse Liberty for any amount paid on the claim up to the deductible; payments over and above the deductible were to be borne by Liberty. The policies also required American Tissue to pay premiums, but the total amount of the premiums was to be adjusted retrospectively based, among other things, on actual losses experienced by Liberty. The policies thus provided some protection for American Tissue but greater protection for injured workers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the year 2000, American Tissue encountered financial difficulties and failed to make required payments to Liberty. So, as a condition of renewing the policies, Liberty insisted that American Tissue obtain guarantees to secure American Tissue's present and future obligations to reimburse Liberty. On December 11, 2000, the two companies signed an agreement to this effect (\"the agreement\") and Liberty then renewed American Tissue's policies for the period January 1, 2001, to January 1, 2002 (\"the 2001 policies\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement, which is at the center of the dispute, said that its purpose was to secure all of American Tissue's obligations to Liberty arising out of the 1999 and 2001 policies, including both reimbursements and premiums, and provided that payments due must be paid within 20 days of Liberty's written demand. To secure these payments, American Tissue agreed to deliver both a surety bond and a letter of credit in favor of Liberty, substantially in the form of the bond and letter of credit attached to the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement provided that the amounts of the required bond and letter of credit would be fixed by schedules prepared by Liberty; but it also provided that Liberty \"at its sole discretion\" could increase the amounts by providing American Tissue revised schedules, whenever Liberty feared that the existing amounts so guaranteed were inadequate to cover American Tissue's existing obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, Liberty sought a surety bond of $1,777,500 and a letter of credit of $2,172,500; however, American Tissue was unable to immediately supply so large a letter of credit. Accordingly, Liberty agreed to a bond in the amount of $3.7 million and a $250,000 letter of credit, provided that American Tissue thereafter increase the letter to reach $2,172,500 by April 15, 2001. The collateral-amount schedule read:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Letter of Credit $250,000 to be increased to $2,172,500 no later than 4/15/2001</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Surety Bond $3,700,000 may be decreased to $1,777,500 on receipt of Letter(s) of Credit totaling $2,172,500</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the final agreement, the deadline for supplementing the letter of credit was changed to June 1, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 24, 2001, American Tissue obtained the required $3.7 million surety bond from Greenwich. In the archaic form sometimes used for surety bonds, the bond read that it would be void if American Tissue carried out its obligations under its agreement with Liberty but \"otherwise\" American Tissue and Greenwich were each jointly and severally liable in the amount of the bond. Separately, American Tissue agreed to indemnify Greenwich for any payments that Greenwich had to make to Liberty under the bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having obtained an initial letter of credit for $250,000 on February 12, 2001, American Tissue on May 16, 2001, obtained an additional letter of credit for $2,172,500. Not long after, American Tissue sent an e-mail to Marsh &amp; McLennan requesting that the surety bond be reduced to $1,777,500 in accordance with the agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Marsh &amp; McLennan forwarded the request to Greenwich, which responded that the bond reduction \"can be done by rider, but it must be acknowledged by the carrier\" &#8212; apparently meaning that Liberty must be notified first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, there is no evidence that Liberty was itself notified, or that it consented to a bond reduction, or that the bond amount was in fact ever reduced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Instead, during 2001 American Tissue began to miss payments to Liberty and, on July 13, 2001, Liberty issued a new schedule raising (without qualification) the required security to $2,422,500 in letters of credit (the value of the two existing letters) and $3.7 million for the surety bond. Thereafter, to satisfy some of American Tissue's debt, Liberty drew down almost in full both existing letters of credit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 17, 2001, and again on September 7, Liberty notified American Tissue that the latter was in default under the agreement on account of continued non-payments. On September 10, 2001, American Tissue filed for bankruptcy in Delaware. On October 9, Liberty wrote to Greenwich, claiming that the bankruptcy constituted a default under the agreement and bond, making Greenwich liable for the full amount of the bond ($3.7 million), which Liberty now asserts is less than the estimated loss that Liberty is going to suffer from American Tissue's default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Greenwich's refusal to pay, Liberty on January 29, 2002, filed a two-count complaint against Greenwich in the federal district court. The first count (which alone is before us) claimed breach of contract for non-payment of the full amount of the bond. In due course, the district court granted summary judgment in Liberty's favor and certified this judgment as separate and final pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b). (Still unresolved, and not before us, are a claim by Liberty under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A (2002) and counterclaims by Greenwich on several different theories.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Greenwich's first and most extensive argument is on the merits of Liberty's contract claim. Its position is that under the surety bond, incorporating relevant terms of the agreement between Liberty and American Tissue, it can be liable to Liberty only for the amount of $1,777,500 &#8212; the sum to which the agreement permitted American Tissue to reduce the bond once it had secured letters of credit totaling $2,172,500. Alternatively, Greenwich says that at least the bond and agreement were ambiguous, presenting an issue of fact precluding summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement provides explicitly that its terms are governed by Massachusetts law; the surety bond is silent but here the parties cite Massachusetts law as well and we accept their implicit premise. <i>See McAdams v. Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 391 F.3d 287, 298 n. 5 (1st Cir.2004). The grant of summary judgment is reviewed <i>de novo, Dasey v. Anderson,</i> 304 F.3d 148, 153 (1st Cir.2002); and ordinarily contract interpretation is for the court unless disputed issues of fact bear upon the interpretation of ambiguous language. <i>Fishman v. LaSalle Nat'l Bank,</i> 247 F.3d 300, 303 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view &#8212; and this too is a question of law for the court, <i>Lanier Prof'l Servs., Inc. v. Ricci,</i> 192 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1999) &#8212; neither the bond nor the agreement is ambiguous in any way relevant here. By its terms, the full amount of the bond is payable upon an act of default by American Tissue, and Greenwich does not deny that such a default occurred. Nor does Greenwich claim that it did issue a substitute bond in an amount smaller than $3,700,000 or otherwise issued any rider reducing the amount of the bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, Greenwich argues in substance that American Tissue had a right, after furnishing the second letter of credit, to reduce the bond to $1,777,500, that it took steps to do so, and that the mechanics of the reduction even if not achieved were a mere \"ministerial act.\" It then argues that the reduction should be treated as automatic or as accomplished by the steps taken, that the reduction would carry out the intent of the parties, and that failing to reduce the amount would reward Liberty for withholding consent that it was required to provide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing to these arguments. We will assume, as Greenwich urges, that the bond should be read in conjunction with the underlying agreement which permitted American Tissue to have Greenwich reduce the amount of the bond to $1,777,500. But the agreement said that American Tissue \"may\" reduce the amount; it did not say that it had to do so or that the reduction would be automatic. American Tissue started the steps to accomplish a reduction but did not complete them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither American Tissue nor Greenwich acted as if a reduction were automatic. American Tissue made a specific request for a reduction; Greenwich countered that notice to Liberty would be required. The bond provided that it could not be cancelled without 60 days advance notice to Liberty. Had Greenwich or American Tissue proposed such a reduction to Liberty in mid-2001, Liberty could have raised the amount of security that it was entitled to demand. By mid-2001, American Tissue was missing payments and Liberty did in fact re-schedule the security required to set the bond amount at $3,700,000, bringing the total security amount required to $6,122,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under both case law and general usage, the term \"may\" usually indicates that something is permissive, not mandatory or automatic.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Yes, in rare situations, it can be read differently, <i>cf. In re Ionosphere Clubs Inc.,</i> 111 B.R. 436, 441 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.1990); but here the agreement taken as a whole &#8212; both in language and purpose &#8212; gave American Tissue a right to insist on a reduction but also allowed Liberty to counter a threatened reduction by amending the schedule upward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not make the downsizing option meaningless. American Tissue did have a unilateral option&#8212;albeit never effectively exercised &#8212; to insist on a reduction in the bond amount after posting the new letter of credit, <i>unless</i> Liberty increased the security required. The agreement gave Liberty absolute discretion, but if Liberty had increased the security schedule in bad faith (say, because the existing security was and would remain patently adequate), it might well not have prevailed. <i>See FDIC v. LeBlanc,</i> 85 F.3d 815, 819 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greenwich's contract argument requires little further discussion. There is no evidence that the parties intended anything but what happened&#8212;so much for citations to reformation doctrine, <i>see Polaroid Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Co.,</i> 414 Mass. 747, 610 N.E.2d 912, 917 (1993)&#8212;and the equity maxim (that equity will treat as done that which ought to be done, <i>see In re Cumberland Farms, Inc.,</i> 249 B.R. 341, 355-56 (Bankr.D.Mass.2000)), is inapt where, as here, the thing allegedly to be done (a reduction in the bond) was subject to being legitimately countered by an increase in the required security.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Greenwich's other arguments which, although briefly presented, are more interesting. The first turns on a provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 365(e)(1) (2000), popularly known as the <i>ipso facto</i> clause. Pertinently, this section prevents an executory contract or lease from being automatically terminated or modified by virtue of the other party's filing for bankruptcy. The aim is to protect the right of the bankruptcy estate to adopt, reaffirm and continue a contract or lease where this will serve the estate's interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the filing for bankruptcy by American Tissue was an act of default under the terms of the agreement between Liberty and American Tissue, and it was explicitly invoked by Liberty as the basis for its claim against the bond. Greenwich, noting that both it and American Tissue were liable under the bond, says that Greenwich itself is entitled to invoke section 365(e)(1) as to any claim against it. The district court disagreed, holding that the <i>ipso facto</i> clause is intended to protect a bankruptcy debtor, not a third party like Greenwich.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a surprising paucity of precedent. A few lower court decisions favor the district court's view; one points the other way.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> However, a careful reading of the statute and an understanding of its purpose readily confirm that&#8212;whatever protection the statute may give American Tissue in protecting its own rights vis-&#224;-vis Liberty under the agreement &#8212; the statute in no way invalidates a separate claim by Liberty against Greenwich under the bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with statutory language, as is normally proper. <i>United States v. Tapia-Escalera,</i> 356 F.3d 181, 185 (1st Cir.2004). Greenwich correctly notes that section 365(e)(1) does not by its terms say that only the bankrupt can invoke it. But the statute also says that what may not be terminated or modified by bankruptcy is \"an executory contract or unexpired lease <i>of the debtor</i>\" or \"any right or obligation under such contract or lease.\" This is strong linguistic evidence that Congress was concerned with clauses diluting the bankrupt's interests&#8212;not interests of a third party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same result follows when one considers the purpose of the section. This purpose &#8212; avowed in both legislative history and case law&#8212;is to protect the bankruptcy estate, primarily against the loss of contractual rights that the estate might choose to assume and reaffirm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Holding Greenwich liable does not modify rights of the American Tissue estate against Liberty or prevent the estate from reaffirming any contractual rights it may have under its policies with Liberty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties choose to talk of the matter as if it is a question of standing, namely, who is entitled to invoke section 365(e)(1). We do not so view the problem or say that a third party can never rely on the section. Rather, our holding here rests on the proposition that the district court adjudicated in this case only a contract claim <i>by Liberty against Greenwich.</i> The bond is an independent obligation of Greenwich which happens to have been triggered by a third party's non-payments of debts and resort to bankruptcy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beside the point that American Tissue may be a co-guarantor under the bond and might have a defense if sued itself. If two persons are jointly and severally liable on a contract, the fact that one has a defense (<i>e.g.,</i> because underaged when the contract was signed) does not automatically protect the other against suit for nonperformance. <i>See Dexter v. Blanchard,</i> 93 Mass. (11 Allen) 365 (1865). This is not a case where a principal's obligation under the surety contract is \"void.\" 2 <i>Farnsworth on Contracts</i> &#167; 6.3 at 118 (3d ed.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly as a result of paying Liberty the full amount of the bond, Greenwich will have an enlarged claim against the American Tissue estate under its indemnity agreement with American Tissue. But every increase in the estate's debt to Greenwich will likely be offset by a reduced debt of the estate to Liberty. That Greenwich chose, for the bond premium, to protect Liberty by risking the loss itself does not appear to have any visible effect on the estate's net obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As its third distinct objection to the judgment, Greenwich says that the bond makes it liable upon the default to pay the full amount of the bond regardless of the actual damages to Liberty and that this invalidates the bond under Massachusetts law as an improper penalty. In Massachusetts, as in other jurisdictions, a liquidated damages clause is not allowed where damages can readily be ascertained. <i>See A-Z Servicenter, Inc. v. Segall,</i> 334 Mass. 672, 138 N.E.2d 266, 268 (1956).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Possibly seeking to thwart this objection, Liberty offered to return to Greenwich any portion of the bond amount that was not needed to cover existing or potential liability of American Tissue to Liberty. If this was a gratuitous offer by Liberty, it would not defeat an objection to the bond under Massachusetts law; it is a different question whether the commitment could be taken as a proper reading of the bond&#8212; which has language pointing both ways&#8212; but we need not decide it because the bond is independently valid, even if the face value is payable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, a fixed sum specified in advance as contract damages is normally sustained if actual damages are difficult to ascertain in advance;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> if this condition is not met, or if the amount specified is grossly disproportionate to a reasonable estimate, enforcement is denied. <i>See Kelly v. Marx,</i> 428 Mass. 877, 705 N.E.2d 1114, 1116 (1999). This is Massachusetts law, so it does not matter whether it is viewed as an antique impairment of freedom of contract or a healthy protection against improvident bargains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greenwich argues that it is easy to ascertain how much American Tissue owes to Liberty, because as of any specific date there may be unpaid premiums and unpaid reimbursements due under the policies; but these, says Greenwich, can easily be calculated. Further, it suggests, the amounts currently due are far less than the full amount that Liberty is claiming under the bond. Both arguments are misleading, mainly because Greenwich is understating the scope of the damage to Liberty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Liberty policies already described committed Liberty to make workers' compensation payments for accidents occurring within the period covered by the policies. Such claims may entail payments to be made over many years following an accident and for periods (which may depend on changes in the victim's condition or status) that cannot be ascertained at the time of an initial award of compensation. <i>See</i> 7 <i>Larson's Workers' Compensation Law</i> &#167; 126 (2000) (describing notice and claim periods).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Liberty's claims against American Tissue under the policies were unknown and, except by actuarial estimate, unknowable at the time that it entered into the policies and secured the bond. This is so both as to reimbursements Liberty would be entitled to on claims not yet even made and as to premium recomputations based on actual claims experience. As it happens, although not required under <i>Kelly v. Marx,</i> even now the final toll is probably still unknowable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Liberty, when setting the security originally required, reasonably estimated the damages it would incur. Indeed, when Liberty later increased its security demand, the record shows that Liberty extrapolated from claims history and data pertaining to similar insureds. Whether it used the same method in originally setting the security is unclear but Greenwich does not challenge the finding that the estimate was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court awarded Liberty just over $1 million in prejudgment interest from the date of Liberty's pre-suit demand upon the bond on October 9, 2001, until the entry of judgment on August 17, 2004. Greenwich's final claim on appeal is that Liberty is not entitled to such prejudgment interest under Massachusetts law. The relevant governing statute is Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231 &#167; 6C (2002), which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all actions based on contractual obligations, upon a verdict, finding or order for pecuniary damages, interest shall be added by the clerk of the court to the amount of damages, at the contract rate, if established, or at the rate of twelve per cent per annum from the date of the breach or demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greenwich argues that because the bond was issued as security for the payment obligations of American Tissue, Liberty could not sustain any loss or \"pecuniary damages\" under the terms of the statute except by proving specific past payments that American Tissue had failed to make. There were missed payments, but the district court did not compute interest on that basis; the liability was based on the face amount of the bond as liquidated damages for the estimated aggregate of missed payments past and future. The district court's reading of the statute was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evident thrust of the statute is to compensate a contract claimant for the deprivation of amounts due under a contract from the time they were payable to the time at which judgment is entered;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> thereafter, if there is any delay in paying the judgment, separate post-judgment interest is due. The district court found that the full bond amount was due at the time of the demand. So both the terms of the statute and the underlying purpose &#8212; to cover loss of the use of the money during litigation &#8212; justify the award.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greenwich cites <i>Sterilite Corp. v.

Passing the question whether the statutory interest is too generous &#8212; which is a legislative judgment &#8212; the interest in this case is not a windfall; it directly and accurately compensates Liberty for being deprived of its contractual right to possess and use the $3.7 million from October 9, 2001, to the date of judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Disola Dev., LLC v.

The district court granted recovery on the bond in favor of the claimant, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (\"Liberty\"), and against the issuer of the bond, Greenwich Insurance Company (\"Greenwich\"). Greenwich has appealed, and we now affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The scene is easily set. In December 1999, American Tissue, Inc. (\"American Tissue\"), a manufacturer now bankrupt, obtained from Liberty two insurance policies to cover workers' compensation that American Tissue might be forced to pay in the course of its ordinary operations. The policies (\"the 1999 policies\") were to cover accidents occurring during the period December 11, 1999-January 1, 2001, and provided coverage for American Tissue for amounts that it might owe for such accidents over and above a deductible of $250,000 for each claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These policies were \"fronting policies,\" providing that Liberty would pay all claims in their entirety up front and that American would reimburse Liberty for any amount paid on the claim up to the deductible; payments over and above the deductible were to be borne by Liberty. The policies also required American Tissue to pay premiums, but the total amount of the premiums was to be adjusted retrospectively based, among other things, on actual losses experienced by Liberty. The policies thus provided some protection for American Tissue but greater protection for injured workers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the year 2000, American Tissue encountered financial difficulties and failed to make required payments to Liberty. So, as a condition of renewing the policies, Liberty insisted that American Tissue obtain guarantees to secure American Tissue's present and future obligations to reimburse Liberty. On December 11, 2000, the two companies signed an agreement to this effect (\"the agreement\") and Liberty then renewed American Tissue's policies for the period January 1, 2001, to January 1, 2002 (\"the 2001 policies\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement, which is at the center of the dispute, said that its purpose was to secure all of American Tissue's obligations to Liberty arising out of the 1999 and 2001 policies, including both reimbursements and premiums, and provided that payments due must be paid within 20 days of Liberty's written demand. To secure these payments, American Tissue agreed to deliver both a surety bond and a letter of credit in favor of Liberty, substantially in the form of the bond and letter of credit attached to the agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement provided that the amounts of the required bond and letter of credit would be fixed by schedules prepared by Liberty; but it also provided that Liberty \"at its sole discretion\" could increase the amounts by providing American Tissue revised schedules, whenever Liberty feared that the existing amounts so guaranteed were inadequate to cover American Tissue's existing obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, Liberty sought a surety bond of $1,777,500 and a letter of credit of $2,172,500; however, American Tissue was unable to immediately supply so large a letter of credit. Accordingly, Liberty agreed to a bond in the amount of $3.7 million and a $250,000 letter of credit, provided that American Tissue thereafter increase the letter to reach $2,172,500 by April 15, 2001. The collateral-amount schedule read:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Letter of Credit $250,000 to be increased to $2,172,500 no later than 4/15/2001</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Surety Bond $3,700,000 may be decreased to $1,777,500 on receipt of Letter(s) of Credit totaling $2,172,500</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the final agreement, the deadline for supplementing the letter of credit was changed to June 1, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 24, 2001, American Tissue obtained the required $3.7 million surety bond from Greenwich. In the archaic form sometimes used for surety bonds, the bond read that it would be void if American Tissue carried out its obligations under its agreement with Liberty but \"otherwise\" American Tissue and Greenwich were each jointly and severally liable in the amount of the bond. Separately, American Tissue agreed to indemnify Greenwich for any payments that Greenwich had to make to Liberty under the bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having obtained an initial letter of credit for $250,000 on February 12, 2001, American Tissue on May 16, 2001, obtained an additional letter of credit for $2,172,500. Not long after, American Tissue sent an e-mail to Marsh &amp; McLennan requesting that the surety bond be reduced to $1,777,500 in accordance with the agreement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Marsh &amp; McLennan forwarded the request to Greenwich, which responded that the bond reduction \"can be done by rider, but it must be acknowledged by the carrier\" &#8212; apparently meaning that Liberty must be notified first.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all events, there is no evidence that Liberty was itself notified, or that it consented to a bond reduction, or that the bond amount was in fact ever reduced.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Instead, during 2001 American Tissue began to miss payments to Liberty and, on July 13, 2001, Liberty issued a new schedule raising (without qualification) the required security to $2,422,500 in letters of credit (the value of the two existing letters) and $3.7 million for the surety bond. Thereafter, to satisfy some of American Tissue's debt, Liberty drew down almost in full both existing letters of credit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 17, 2001, and again on September 7, Liberty notified American Tissue that the latter was in default under the agreement on account of continued non-payments. On September 10, 2001, American Tissue filed for bankruptcy in Delaware. On October 9, Liberty wrote to Greenwich, claiming that the bankruptcy constituted a default under the agreement and bond, making Greenwich liable for the full amount of the bond ($3.7 million), which Liberty now asserts is less than the estimated loss that Liberty is going to suffer from American Tissue's default.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On Greenwich's refusal to pay, Liberty on January 29, 2002, filed a two-count complaint against Greenwich in the federal district court. The first count (which alone is before us) claimed breach of contract for non-payment of the full amount of the bond. In due course, the district court granted summary judgment in Liberty's favor and certified this judgment as separate and final pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 54(b).

Laws ch. 93A (2002) and counterclaims by Greenwich on several different theories.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Greenwich's first and most extensive argument is on the merits of Liberty's contract claim. Its position is that under the surety bond, incorporating relevant terms of the agreement between Liberty and American Tissue, it can be liable to Liberty only for the amount of $1,777,500 &#8212; the sum to which the agreement permitted American Tissue to reduce the bond once it had secured letters of credit totaling $2,172,500. Alternatively, Greenwich says that at least the bond and agreement were ambiguous, presenting an issue of fact precluding summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement provides explicitly that its terms are governed by Massachusetts law; the surety bond is silent but here the parties cite Massachusetts law as well and we accept their implicit premise. <i>See McAdams v.

LaSalle Nat'l Bank,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199389\"><a href=\"/opinion/199389/fishman-v-lasalle-national/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 303 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view &#8212; and this too is a question of law for the court, <i>Lanier Prof'l Servs., Inc. v. Ricci,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198643\"><a href=\"/opinion/198643/lanier-professional-v-ricci/\"><span class=\"volume\">192</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.1999) &#8212; neither the bond nor the agreement is ambiguous in any way relevant here. By its terms, the full amount of the bond is payable upon an act of default by American Tissue, and Greenwich does not deny that such a default occurred. Nor does Greenwich claim that it did issue a substitute bond in an amount smaller than $3,700,000 or otherwise issued any rider reducing the amount of the bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rather, Greenwich argues in substance that American Tissue had a right, after furnishing the second letter of credit, to reduce the bond to $1,777,500, that it took steps to do so, and that the mechanics of the reduction even if not achieved were a mere \"ministerial act.\" It then argues that the reduction should be treated as automatic or as accomplished by the steps taken, that the reduction would carry out the intent of the parties, and that failing to reduce the amount would reward Liberty for withholding consent that it was required to provide.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing to these arguments. We will assume, as Greenwich urges, that the bond should be read in conjunction with the underlying agreement which permitted American Tissue to have Greenwich reduce the amount of the bond to $1,777,500. But the agreement said that American Tissue \"may\" reduce the amount; it did not say that it had to do so or that the reduction would be automatic. American Tissue started the steps to accomplish a reduction but did not complete them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither American Tissue nor Greenwich acted as if a reduction were automatic. American Tissue made a specific request for a reduction; Greenwich countered that notice to Liberty would be required. The bond provided that it could not be cancelled without 60 days advance notice to Liberty. Had Greenwich or American Tissue proposed such a reduction to Liberty in mid-2001, Liberty could have raised the amount of security that it was entitled to demand. By mid-2001, American Tissue was missing payments and Liberty did in fact re-schedule the security required to set the bond amount at $3,700,000, bringing the total security amount required to $6,122,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under both case law and general usage, the term \"may\" usually indicates that something is permissive, not mandatory or automatic.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Yes, in rare situations, it can be read differently, <i>cf. In re Ionosphere Clubs Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1960963\"><a href=\"/opinion/1960963/in-re-ionosphere-clubs-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 441 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y.1990); but here the agreement taken as a whole &#8212; both in language and purpose &#8212; gave American Tissue a right to insist on a reduction but also allowed Liberty to counter a threatened reduction by amending the schedule upward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This does not make the downsizing option meaningless. American Tissue did have a unilateral option&#8212;albeit never effectively exercised &#8212; to insist on a reduction in the bond amount after posting the new letter of credit, <i>unless</i> Liberty increased the security required. The agreement gave Liberty absolute discretion, but if Liberty had increased the security schedule in bad faith (say, because the existing security was and would remain patently adequate), it might well not have prevailed. <i>See FDIC v. LeBlanc,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196805\"><a href=\"/opinion/196805/fdic-v-leblanc/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">815</span></a></span>, 819 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greenwich's contract argument requires little further discussion. There is no evidence that the parties intended anything but what happened&#8212;so much for citations to reformation doctrine, <i>see Polaroid Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2110689\"><a href=\"/opinion/2110689/polaroid-corp-v-the-travelers-indemnity-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">414</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">747</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2110689\"><a href=\"/opinion/2110689/polaroid-corp-v-the-travelers-indemnity-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">610</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">912</span></a></span>, 917 (1993)&#8212;and the equity maxim (that equity will treat as done that which ought to be done, <i>see In re Cumberland Farms, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1859423\"><a href=\"/opinion/1859423/in-re-cumberland-farms-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span>, 355-56 (Bankr.D.Mass.2000)), is inapt where, as here, the thing allegedly to be done (a reduction in the bond) was subject to being legitimately countered by an increase in the required security.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Greenwich's other arguments which, although briefly presented, are more interesting. The first turns on a provision of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. &#167; 365(e)(1) (2000), popularly known as the <i>ipso facto</i> clause. Pertinently, this section prevents an executory contract or lease from being automatically terminated or modified by virtue of the other party's filing for bankruptcy. The aim is to protect the right of the bankruptcy estate to adopt, reaffirm and continue a contract or lease where this will serve the estate's interests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the filing for bankruptcy by American Tissue was an act of default under the terms of the agreement between Liberty and American Tissue, and it was explicitly invoked by Liberty as the basis for its claim against the bond. Greenwich, noting that both it and American Tissue were liable under the bond, says that Greenwich itself is entitled to invoke section 365(e)(1) as to any claim against it. The district court disagreed, holding that the <i>ipso facto</i> clause is intended to protect a bankruptcy debtor, not a third party like Greenwich.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is a surprising paucity of precedent. A few lower court decisions favor the district court's view; one points the other way.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> However, a careful reading of the statute and an understanding of its purpose readily confirm that&#8212;whatever protection the statute may give American Tissue in protecting its own rights vis-&#224;-vis Liberty under the agreement &#8212; the statute in no way invalidates a separate claim by Liberty against Greenwich under the bond.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with statutory language, as is normally proper. <i>United States v. Tapia-Escalera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200834\"><a href=\"/opinion/200834/united-states-v-tapia-escalera/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span>, 185 (1st Cir.2004). Greenwich correctly notes that section 365(e)(1) does not by its terms say that only the bankrupt can invoke it. But the statute also says that what may not be terminated or modified by bankruptcy is \"an executory contract or unexpired lease <i>of the debtor</i>\" or \"any right or obligation under such contract or lease.\" This is strong linguistic evidence that Congress was concerned with clauses diluting the bankrupt's interests&#8212;not interests of a third party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The same result follows when one considers the purpose of the section. This purpose &#8212; avowed in both legislative history and case law&#8212;is to protect the bankruptcy estate, primarily against the loss of contractual rights that the estate might choose to assume and reaffirm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Holding Greenwich liable does not modify rights of the American Tissue estate against Liberty or prevent the estate from reaffirming any contractual rights it may have under its policies with Liberty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties choose to talk of the matter as if it is a question of standing, namely, who is entitled to invoke section 365(e)(1). We do not so view the problem or say that a third party can never rely on the section. Rather, our holding here rests on the proposition that the district court adjudicated in this case only a contract claim <i>by Liberty against Greenwich.</i> The bond is an independent obligation of Greenwich which happens to have been triggered by a third party's non-payments of debts and resort to bankruptcy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beside the point that American Tissue may be a co-guarantor under the bond and might have a defense if sued itself. If two persons are jointly and severally liable on a contract, the fact that one has a defense (<i>e.g.,</i> because underaged when the contract was signed) does not automatically protect the other against suit for nonperformance. <i>See Dexter v. Blanchard,</i> 93 Mass. (11 Allen) 365 (1865). This is not a case where a principal's obligation under the surety contract is \"void.\" 2 <i>Farnsworth on Contracts</i> &#167; 6.3 at 118 (3d ed.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Certainly as a result of paying Liberty the full amount of the bond, Greenwich will have an enlarged claim against the American Tissue estate under its indemnity agreement with American Tissue. But every increase in the estate's debt to Greenwich will likely be offset by a reduced debt of the estate to Liberty. That Greenwich chose, for the bond premium, to protect Liberty by risking the loss itself does not appear to have any visible effect on the estate's net obligations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As its third distinct objection to the judgment, Greenwich says that the bond makes it liable upon the default to pay the full amount of the bond regardless of the actual damages to Liberty and that this invalidates the bond under Massachusetts law as an improper penalty. In Massachusetts, as in other jurisdictions, a liquidated damages clause is not allowed where damages can readily be ascertained. <i>See A-Z Servicenter, Inc. v. Segall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2091590\"><a href=\"/opinion/2091590/az-servicenter-inc-v-segall/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">672</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2091590\"><a href=\"/opinion/2091590/az-servicenter-inc-v-segall/\"><span class=\"volume\">138</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, 268 (1956).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Possibly seeking to thwart this objection, Liberty offered to return to Greenwich any portion of the bond amount that was not needed to cover existing or potential liability of American Tissue to Liberty. If this was a gratuitous offer by Liberty, it would not defeat an objection to the bond under Massachusetts law; it is a different question whether the commitment could be taken as a proper reading of the bond&#8212; which has language pointing both ways&#8212; but we need not decide it because the bond is independently valid, even if the face value is payable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Massachusetts law, a fixed sum specified in advance as contract damages is normally sustained if actual damages are difficult to ascertain in advance;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> if this condition is not met, or if the amount specified is grossly disproportionate to a reasonable estimate, enforcement is denied. <i>See Kelly v. Marx,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">877</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">705</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1114</span></span>, 1116 (1999). This is Massachusetts law, so it does not matter whether it is viewed as an antique impairment of freedom of contract or a healthy protection against improvident bargains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greenwich argues that it is easy to ascertain how much American Tissue owes to Liberty, because as of any specific date there may be unpaid premiums and unpaid reimbursements due under the policies; but these, says Greenwich, can easily be calculated. Further, it suggests, the amounts currently due are far less than the full amount that Liberty is claiming under the bond. Both arguments are misleading, mainly because Greenwich is understating the scope of the damage to Liberty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Liberty policies already described committed Liberty to make workers' compensation payments for accidents occurring within the period covered by the policies. Such claims may entail payments to be made over many years following an accident and for periods (which may depend on changes in the victim's condition or status) that cannot be ascertained at the time of an initial award of compensation. <i>See</i> 7 <i>Larson's Workers' Compensation Law</i> &#167; 126 (2000) (describing notice and claim periods).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, Liberty's claims against American Tissue under the policies were unknown and, except by actuarial estimate, unknowable at the time that it entered into the policies and secured the bond. This is so both as to reimbursements Liberty would be entitled to on claims not yet even made and as to premium recomputations based on actual claims experience. As it happens, although not required under <i>Kelly v. Marx,</i> even now the final toll is probably still unknowable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that Liberty, when setting the security originally required, reasonably estimated the damages it would incur. Indeed, when Liberty later increased its security demand, the record shows that Liberty extrapolated from claims history and data pertaining to similar insureds. Whether it used the same method in originally setting the security is unclear but Greenwich does not challenge the finding that the estimate was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court awarded Liberty just over $1 million in prejudgment interest from the date of Liberty's pre-suit demand upon the bond on October 9, 2001, until the entry of judgment on August 17, 2004. Greenwich's final claim on appeal is that Liberty is not entitled to such prejudgment interest under Massachusetts law. The relevant governing statute is Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231 &#167; 6C (2002), which provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In all actions based on contractual obligations, upon a verdict, finding or order for pecuniary damages, interest shall be added by the clerk of the court to the amount of damages, at the contract rate, if established, or at the rate of twelve per cent per annum from the date of the breach or demand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Greenwich argues that because the bond was issued as security for the payment obligations of American Tissue, Liberty could not sustain any loss or \"pecuniary damages\" under the terms of the statute except by proving specific past payments that American Tissue had failed to make. There were missed payments, but the district court did not compute interest on that basis; the liability was based on the face amount of the bond as liquidated damages for the estimated aggregate of missed payments past and future. The district court's reading of the statute was correct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evident thrust of the statute is to compensate a contract claimant for the deprivation of amounts due under a contract from the time they were payable to the time at which judgment is entered;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> thereafter, if there is any delay in paying the judgment, separate post-judgment interest is due. The district court found that the full bond amount was due at the time of the demand.
