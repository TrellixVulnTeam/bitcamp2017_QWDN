On October 18, 2000, a federal\n\ngrand jury sitting in the District of Rhode Island returned a four-\n\ncount indictment against, inter alia, defendant-appellant Nickoyan\n\nWallace.   The indictment charged him with the robbery of a gun shop\n\n(count 1); conspiring to commit the robbery (count 2); theft of\n\nfirearms from a federally-licensed firearms dealer (count 3); and\n\nbrandishing a firearm during and in relation to a crime of violence\n\n(count 4).    See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1951, 922(u), 924(c)(1)(A)(ii).             The\n\nappellant's first trial resulted in a hung jury.           Upon retrial, a\n\nsecond jury convicted him across the board.\n\n           The district court sentenced the appellant to a 120-month\n\nincarcerative term on the first three counts (the top of the\n\napplicable guideline sentencing range) and imposed a consecutive\n\nsentence of 84 months on count 4.          This appeal followed.\n\n           We will not tarry.        We have reviewed the record with\n\ncare. That appraisal reveals not only overwhelming evidence of the\n\nappellant's guilt but also the absence of reversible error.           Since\n\nthe questions presented are straightforward, it would be pointless\n\nfor us to write at length.        We will, however, comment on each of\n\nthe appellant's four assignments of error.1\n\n             1.   The appellant complains that the district court, at\n\nsentencing,       erroneously   imposed    a   two-level   enhancement     for\n\n\n\n     1\n      There is also a fifth ground of appeal:        a             claim    of\ncumulative error. That claim requires no discussion.\n\n                                    -2-\n\fobstruction    of   justice   (and,    thus,   effectively      increased   his\n\nsentence).     We discern no error.\n\n          An    enhancement    under    USSG    §3C1.1   is   proper   when   a\n\ndefendant intentionally       provides      false   testimony    concerning   a\n\nmaterial matter.     See United States v. Villarman-Oviedo, 325 F.3d\n\n1, 16 (1st Cir. 2003); United States v. Rowe, 202 F.3d 37, 43 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).     Because this determination is inescapably factbound,\n\nappellate review is for clear error.           United States v. Cash, 266\n\nF.3d 42, 44 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. David, 940 F.2d 722,\n\n739 (1st Cir. 1991).          Thus, the district court's finding of\n\nobstruction can be set aside only if whole-record review leaves us\n\nwith the \"definite and firm conviction that a mistake has been\n\ncommitted.\"     United States v. U.S. Gypsum Co., 333 U.S. 364, 395\n\n(1948).\n\n             In this instance, the district court zeroed in on the\n\nappellant's attempt to distance himself from a cell phone that the\n\nrobbers had left at the scene of the crime.              The court found in\n\npertinent part:\n\n             There's no question that the defendant\n             committed perjury during this trial. He lied\n             bald faced lies and he was thoroughly\n             impeached by the prosecutor.     He created a\n             fictitious man.    This James Coleman didn't\n             exist. The prosecutor completely devastated\n             him on cross-examination concerning the use of\n             that cell phone that was left behind. . . .\n             And that is an attempt to obstruct justice.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fTaken in context, this excerpt makes clear the district court's\n\nthinking that both the cell phone incident and the appellant's\n\ninvention of \"James Coleman\" were simply examples of how far he was\n\nwilling to stretch the truth.2      The more fundamental point is that\n\nthe court believed — supportably — that the appellant testified\n\nfalsely when he denied having anything to do with the robbery or\n\nthe stolen guns.       The jury necessarily rejected the appellant's\n\ntestimony in rendering its verdict and there can be no serious\n\nquestion   as   to   the   testimony's     materiality.     Under    these\n\ncircumstances, the district court did not commit clear error in\n\ndetermining that the appellant provided materially false testimony.\n\nSee, e.g., Villarman-Oviedo, 325 F.3d at 16.\n\n           2.    The    appellant   next   argues   that   his   jailhouse\n\nconfession to a fellow inmate, Willie Preston, should not have been\n\nallowed as a part of the government's case in chief.        There are two\n\nproblems with this argument.        First, the issue was never raised\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      In all events, there was ample evidence that James Coleman\ndid not exist and that the appellant invented him.       The trial\nevidence revealed that the appellant used the cell phone in\nquestion almost every day during the month leading up to the\nrobbery, undercutting any claim that the phone belonged to the\nmysterious Coleman. The most that the appellant can possibly hope\nto show is that the record supports conflicting inferences\nconcerning whether Coleman really existed and was the true owner of\nthe cell phone.     That dooms the appellant's quest, for the\nsentencing court's choice between plausible alternative inferences\ncannot be clearly erroneous. United States v. Ruiz, 905 F.2d 499,\n508 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                    -4-\n\fbelow (and is, therefore, forfeit).3     See Young v. Lepone, 305 F.3d\n\n1, 13 (1st Cir. 2002) (observing that \"[i]f any principle is\n\nsettled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most extraordinary\n\ncircumstances, legal theories not squarely raised in the lower\n\ncourt cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"); United\n\nStates v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27, 32 (1st Cir. 1992) (similar).\n\nSecond, Preston's testimony was properly admitted.      At the time of\n\nthe   conversation,   Preston    had    no   prearrangement   with   the\n\ngovernment, and, indeed, had never heard about either the appellant\n\nor the gun shop robbery.   Thus, the confession was not obtained in\n\nviolation of the rule announced in Massiah v. United States, 377\n\nU.S. 201 (1964).   We explain briefly.\n\n          Massiah holds that a defendant is denied the basic\n\nprotections of the Sixth Amendment when his own incriminating words\n\nare deliberately elicited from him post-indictment by a federal\n\nagent, in the absence of his counsel, and then used against him at\n\ntrial.    Id. at 205-06.      Thus, a successful Massiah objection\n\nrequires a defendant to show, at a bare minimum, that the person\n\nwith whom he conversed had previously been enlisted for that\n\npurpose by the authorities.     United States v. LaBare, 191 F.3d 60,\n\n65 (1st Cir. 1999).    In the case of a jailhouse informant, the\n\nperson must have been instructed both to focus on, and actively to\n\n\n      3\n      Indeed, the government claims, albeit without supporting\nauthority, that the point is waived. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(h).\nWe need not decide that point.\n\n                                  -5-\n\felicit information from, the defendant.                   Id. at 64-65.     Here, the\n\ninformant (Preston) had no such marching orders.                    The informant's\n\ntestimony was, therefore, properly admitted.\n\n            In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\nappellant argues that Preston's plea agreement, which contained a\n\nstandard provision for a possible sentence reduction under USSG\n\n§5K1.1,   supplied      the    necessary         focus.      Although     this   is   an\n\ningenious    argument,        it   finds    no     support    in    the   case    law.4\n\nMoreover, the appellant failed to advance this argument below, and\n\nit borders on the absurd to suggest that the district court's\n\nallowance of the testimony constituted plain error.                        See, e.g.,\n\nUnited    States   v.    Duarte,     246     F.3d     56,    60    (1st   Cir.   2001)\n\n(enumerating requisite elements of plain error).\n\n            For these reasons, this claim of error fails.\n\n            3.   The appellant's third assignment of error focuses on\n\na single sentence in the prosecutor's closing argument.                          After\n\npointing out that defense counsel had been unable to show that\n\nPreston's testimony at the two trials was inconsistent in any\n\nrespect, the prosecutor stated:             \"That's because there weren't any\n\n[inconsistencies].       He told the truth before, and he's telling the\n\n\n     4\n      To fill this void, the appellant cites dictum in United\nStates v. Washington, 318 F.3d 845, 861 (8th Cir. 2003) (suggesting\nthat \"after-the-fact\" evidence showing government use of an\ninformant's services or a reduction in sentence for an informant's\ncooperation may establish a focus on the defendant). Whatever may\nbe said of that dictum generally, the facts of this case do not\nlend themselves to reaching out for it.\n\n                                           -6-\n\ftruth now.     Mr. Wallace told him about the robbery and about the\n\nphone.\"\n\n           The appellant objects to the underscored sentence as\n\nconstituting impermissible vouching.       Because he interposed no\n\ncontemporaneous objection, we review only for plain error.      United\n\nStates v. Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d 268, 272 (1st Cir. 1987); United\n\nStates v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 99-100 (1st Cir. 1987).     We descry\n\nnone here.\n\n             Vouching occurs when a prosecutor places \"the prestige of\n\nthe government behind a witness by making personal assurances about\n\nthe witness' credibility.\"      United States v. Neal, 36 F.3d 1190,\n\n1207 (1st Cir. 1994).     The law forbids such tactics because they\n\n\"may induce the jury to trust the Government's judgment rather than\n\nits own view of the evidence,\" and thus imperil the accused's right\n\nto be judged solely on the basis of competent proof adduced at\n\ntrial.    United States v. Young, 470 U.S. 1, 18-19 (1985).\n\n           Viewed against this backdrop, it is readily apparent that\n\nthe underscored sentence represents an unfortunate choice of words.\n\nA reasonable juror easily could have taken it as a statement by the\n\nprosecutor of her personal belief in Preston's truthfulness (and,\n\nthus, as improper vouching). But plain error requires, inter alia,\n\na showing that the error affected the defendant's substantial\n\nrights.    See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993);\n\nDuarte, 246 F.3d at 60.     No such showing is possible here.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f              For one thing, any deleterious effect attributable to the\n\nstatement was diluted because it was preceded by a detailed list of\n\nreasons why, based on the trial evidence, the jury should believe\n\nPreston's testimony. The challenged statement was tightly bound to\n\nthat evidence-based argument. For another thing, immediately after\n\nmaking the challenged statement, the prosecutor refocused the jury\n\non the evidence concerning Preston's credibility5 — a step that\n\nmade clear that she was not speaking from personal knowledge.\n\nFinally, the prosecution's case was robust, and the challenged\n\nstatement was merely a single sentence in the course of a four-day\n\ntrial.\n\n              The short of it is that the statement was improper and\n\nshould have been omitted.        But it is wildly unlikely that this\n\nbrief and isolated comment so swayed the jury that the outcome of\n\nthe   trial    was   affected.   Given   the   fleeting   nature   of   the\n\nreference, the context in which it surfaced, the strength of the\n\nprosecution's case, and the court's cautionary instructions, we\n\nfind that the error was harmless (and, therefore, not plain). See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Joyner, 191 F.3d 47, 54-55 (1st Cir. 1999);\n\nUnited States v. Sullivan, 85 F.3d 743, 750-51 (1st Cir. 1996);\n\nUnited States v. Rodriguez-Estrada, 877 F.2d 153, 158 (1st Cir.\n\n1989); Mejia-Lozano, 829 F.2d at 273-74.\n\n\n      5\n      In so doing, the prosecutor invited the jurors to look at the\nfacts bearing on the credibility question, including Preston's\ndemeanor while testifying.\n\n                                   -8-\n\f          4.      The appellant's final argument posits that his\n\nattorney at the second trial rendered substandard assistance,\n\nprincipally in failing to call a particular witness.           We need not\n\ndelve into the particulars of this claim, for it is unripe.\n\n          This court has held, \"with a regularity bordering on the\n\nmonotonous,\" that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel\n\ngenerally cannot be raised for the first time on direct review,\n\nbut, rather, are more properly asserted in a petition for post-\n\njudgment relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.           United States v. Mala, 7\n\nF.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993).            We have, however, crafted a\n\nnarrow exception to this general rule for the rare case in which\n\nthe record is fully developed with respect to the ineffective\n\nassistance claim.        See, e.g., United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d\n\n302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991).         The appellant seeks to bring his claim\n\nwithin this safe harbor.\n\n          His effort founders.           \"The decision whether to call a\n\nparticular     witness    is    almost   always   strategic,   requiring   a\n\nbalancing of the benefits and risks of the anticipated testimony.\"\n\nLema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48, 54 (1st Cir. 1993).            In this\n\ninstance, we do not know if the witness was available, why defense\n\ncounsel did not call her, or what stratagems might have influenced\n\ncounsel's thinking. In fine, the record simply is not developed on\n\nthe relevant points.           Consequently, the claim is not ripe for\n\nreview. See, e.g., United States v. Martinez-Vargas, 321 F.3d 245,\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f251 (1st Cir. 2003); United States v. Perez-Carrera, 243 F.3d 42,\n\n45 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 11 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).\n\n            We need go no further.              For aught that appears, the\n\nappellant     was    fairly     tried,    justly      convicted,    and     lawfully\n\nsentenced.      We    therefore     affirm      the   judgment     below,    without\n\nprejudice,     however,    to    the     appellant's     right     to   raise   his\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim, if he so chooses, by means\n\nof a timely petition for post-conviction relief.                   See 22 U.S.C. §\n\n2255.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f",

The court found in\n\npertinent part:\n\n             There's no question that the defendant\n             committed perjury during this trial. He lied\n             bald faced lies and he was thoroughly\n             impeached by the prosecutor.     He created a\n             fictitious man.    This James Coleman didn't\n             exist. The prosecutor completely devastated\n             him on cross-examination concerning the use of\n             that cell phone that was left behind. . . .\n             And that is an attempt to obstruct justice.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fTaken in context, this excerpt makes clear the district court's\n\nthinking that both the cell phone incident and the appellant's\n\ninvention of \"James Coleman\" were simply examples of how far he was\n\nwilling to stretch the truth.2      The more fundamental point is that\n\nthe court believed — supportably — that the appellant testified\n\nfalsely when he denied having anything to do with the robbery or\n\nthe stolen guns.       The jury necessarily rejected the appellant's\n\ntestimony in rendering its verdict and there can be no serious\n\nquestion   as   to   the   testimony's     materiality.     Under    these\n\ncircumstances, the district court did not commit clear error in\n\ndetermining that the appellant provided materially false testimony.\n\nSee, e.g., Villarman-Oviedo, 325 F.3d at 16.\n\n           2.    The    appellant   next   argues   that   his   jailhouse\n\nconfession to a fellow inmate, Willie Preston, should not have been\n\nallowed as a part of the government's case in chief.        There are two\n\nproblems with this argument.        First, the issue was never raised\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      In all events, there was ample evidence that James Coleman\ndid not exist and that the appellant invented him.       The trial\nevidence revealed that the appellant used the cell phone in\nquestion almost every day during the month leading up to the\nrobbery, undercutting any claim that the phone belonged to the\nmysterious Coleman. The most that the appellant can possibly hope\nto show is that the record supports conflicting inferences\nconcerning whether Coleman really existed and was the true owner of\nthe cell phone.     That dooms the appellant's quest, for the\nsentencing court's choice between plausible alternative inferences\ncannot be clearly erroneous. United States v.

At the time of\n\nthe   conversation,   Preston    had    no   prearrangement   with   the\n\ngovernment, and, indeed, had never heard about either the appellant\n\nor the gun shop robbery.   Thus, the confession was not obtained in\n\nviolation of the rule announced in Massiah v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106822\"><a href=\"/opinion/106822/massiah-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">201</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1964).   We explain briefly.\n\n          Massiah holds that a defendant is denied the basic\n\nprotections of the Sixth Amendment when his own incriminating words\n\nare deliberately elicited from him post-indictment by a federal\n\nagent, in the absence of his counsel, and then used against him at\n\ntrial.    Id. at 205-06.      Thus, a successful Massiah objection\n\nrequires a defendant to show, at a bare minimum, that the person\n\nwith whom he conversed had previously been enlisted for that\n\npurpose by the authorities.     United States v. LaBare, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198625\"><a href=\"/opinion/198625/united-states-v-labare/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">60</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n65 (1st Cir. 1999).    In the case of a jailhouse informant, the\n\nperson must have been instructed both to focus on, and actively to\n\n\n      3\n      Indeed, the government claims, albeit without supporting\nauthority, that the point is waived. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12(h).\nWe need not decide that point.\n\n                                  -5-\n\felicit information from, the defendant.                   Id. at 64-65.     Here, the\n\ninformant (Preston) had no such marching orders.                    The informant's\n\ntestimony was, therefore, properly admitted.\n\n            In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\nappellant argues that Preston's plea agreement, which contained a\n\nstandard provision for a possible sentence reduction under USSG\n\n§5K1.1,   supplied      the    necessary         focus.      Although     this   is   an\n\ningenious    argument,        it   finds    no     support    in    the   case    law.4\n\nMoreover, the appellant failed to advance this argument below, and\n\nit borders on the absurd to suggest that the district court's\n\nallowance of the testimony constituted plain error.                        See, e.g.,\n\nUnited    States   v.

The appellant's third assignment of error focuses on\n\na single sentence in the prosecutor's closing argument.                          After\n\npointing out that defense counsel had been unable to show that\n\nPreston's testimony at the two trials was inconsistent in any\n\nrespect, the prosecutor stated:             \"That's because there weren't any\n\n[inconsistencies].

Whatever may\nbe said of that dictum generally, the facts of this case do not\nlend themselves to reaching out for it.\n\n                                           -6-\n\ftruth now.

Because he interposed no\n\ncontemporaneous objection, we review only for plain error.      United\n\nStates v.

The law forbids such tactics because they\n\n\"may induce the jury to trust the Government's judgment rather than\n\nits own view of the evidence,\" and thus imperil the accused's right\n\nto be judged solely on the basis of competent proof adduced at\n\ntrial.    United States v. Young, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111353\"><a href=\"/opinion/111353/united-states-v-young/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 18-19 (1985).\n\n           Viewed against this backdrop, it is readily apparent that\n\nthe underscored sentence represents an unfortunate choice of words.\n\nA reasonable juror easily could have taken it as a statement by the\n\nprosecutor of her personal belief in Preston's truthfulness (and,\n\nthus, as improper vouching). But plain error requires, inter alia,\n\na showing that the error affected the defendant's substantial\n\nrights.    See United States v. Olano, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 732 (1993);\n\nDuarte, 246 F.3d at 60.     No such showing is possible here.\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f              For one thing, any deleterious effect attributable to the\n\nstatement was diluted because it was preceded by a detailed list of\n\nreasons why, based on the trial evidence, the jury should believe\n\nPreston's testimony. The challenged statement was tightly bound to\n\nthat evidence-based argument. For another thing, immediately after\n\nmaking the challenged statement, the prosecutor refocused the jury\n\non the evidence concerning Preston's credibility5 — a step that\n\nmade clear that she was not speaking from personal knowledge.\n\nFinally, the prosecution's case was robust, and the challenged\n\nstatement was merely a single sentence in the course of a four-day\n\ntrial.\n\n              The short of it is that the statement was improper and\n\nshould have been omitted.        But it is wildly unlikely that this\n\nbrief and isolated comment so swayed the jury that the outcome of\n\nthe   trial    was   affected.   Given   the   fleeting   nature   of   the\n\nreference, the context in which it surfaced, the strength of the\n\nprosecution's case, and the court's cautionary instructions, we\n\nfind that the error was harmless (and, therefore, not plain).

We need not\n\ndelve into the particulars of this claim, for it is unripe.\n\n          This court has held, \"with a regularity bordering on the\n\nmonotonous,\" that claims of ineffective assistance of counsel\n\ngenerally cannot be raised for the first time on direct review,\n\nbut, rather, are more properly asserted in a petition for post-\n\njudgment relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.

The appellant seeks to bring his claim\n\nwithin this safe harbor.\n\n          His effort founders.           \"The decision whether to call a\n\nparticular     witness    is    almost   always   strategic,   requiring   a\n\nbalancing of the benefits and risks of the anticipated testimony.\"\n\nLema v.
