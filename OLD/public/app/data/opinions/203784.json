In this insurance coverage\n\ndispute,     appellant-insurer        Centennial       Insurance       Company\n\n(\"Centennial\") seeks review of the district court's grant of\n\nsummary    judgment   to   appellee-insured      veterinarian    Dr.   Robert\n\nPatterson.     The    district     court    declared   that   Centennial   was\n\nobligated under an insurance policy to legally defend Patterson in\n\na lawsuit instituted against him by Carol Murphy.              After careful\n\nconsideration, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of\n\nPatterson.\n\n                              I.    Background\n\n            For the purposes of summary judgment the facts are as\n\nfollows.   Centennial is a New York insurance company authorized to\n\ndo business in Maine.       Dr. Patterson is a doctor of veterinary\n\nmedicine who practices in Maine.            Centennial provided insurance\n\ncoverage to Patterson pursuant to a Veterinarian's Professional\n\nLiability Policy in effect between the parties during the period\n\nJanuary 1, 2003 through January 1, 2005 (\"the Policy\").\n\n            The Policy states, in relevant part:\n\n            II.   Defense,    Settlement,   Supplementary\n            Payments\n            With respect to such insurance as is afforded\n            by this certificate:\n            A. The Company shall have the right and duty\n            to investigate any Claim or defend any Suit\n            brought against the Insured alleging a\n            Veterinary Incident and seeking damages on\n            account thereof, to which this insurance\n            applies, even if such Claim or Suit is\n            groundless, false, or fraudulent. . . .\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f          Common Certificate Definitions Form\n          D. Claim means any of the following: . . .\n                 2. A Suit, arbitration or other\n          proceeding served on an Insured for damages\n          resulting from a Veterinary Incident.\n          . . .\n          M. Veterinary Incident means any malpractice,\n          negligent act or omission, utterance or\n          publication of a libel or slander, or other\n          defamatory or disparaging material:\n                 1. in the furnishing of professional\n          veterinary services, . . . by the Named\n          Insured or by any person for whom the Named\n          Insured is legally responsible.\n          . . .\n\nRelevant to this dispute, the Policy also contains the following\n\nexclusions:\n\n          III. Exclusions\n          This certificate does not apply to Claim or\n          Suit based upon, arising out of, or related\n          to: . . .\n          H. any actual or alleged;\n          1. dishonest, fraudulent, criminal, malicious\n          act, or malicious omission by any Insured;\n          2. willful violation of any law, statute,\n          ordinance, rule or regulation by any Insured.\n\n          In September 2006, Murphy initiated a pro se civil action\n\nin federal court against the State of Maine and eighty or more\n\ndefendants,   including   Dr.   Patterson,   alleging   various   claims\n\narising from proceedings brought against Murphy by the State of\n\nMaine for animal cruelty.       Murphy had been charged by the State\n\nwith animal cruelty for not providing proper food, water, or\n\nshelter to approximately sixty animals on her farm.         She sought\n\n\"compensatory and punitive damages\" and injunctive relief, namely,\n\nthe \"return of all [her] property.\"\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f           The claims against Dr. Patterson arose from his alleged\n\ntestimony against Murphy at an Animal Possession Hearing, which was\n\nheld on March 19, 2004 (the \"Hearing\"), and also, Dr. Patterson's\n\nalleged   examination   of   her   animals   in   connection   with   those\n\nproceedings.1\n\n\n1\n   Murphy's complaint, a 60-page document labeled \"Second Amended\nJudicial Brief,\" included the following claims:\n\n1.   This action is brought by the Plaintiff . . . to remedy\n[various violations] by State Officials and others . . . that\ndeprived CAROL MURPHY . . . of rights, privileges or immunities\nsecured or legally protected by the United States Constitution and\nAmendments, Civil Rights and Human Rights and the laws of the\nUnited States.\n\n2. These specifically include but are not limited to those rights,\nprivileges and immunities found in and secured and/or protected by\nthe Constitution [and various provisions therein]. . . also the\nConstitutional right to be protected from . . . perjury and\nsubornation of perjury, libel, slander, malfeasance, misfeasance,\nnonfeasance . . . etc. . . .\n\n129. . . . DR. PATTERSON D.V.M. . . . of CLEARWATER VETERINARY\nHOSPITAL . . . testified [at the Animal Possession Hearing] that\nMs. Murphy's animals were in horrible condition, no veterinary\ncare, no food, no water, were filthy, that the house had six inches\nof feces on the floors and that the animals had received no food or\nwater for months. This is again racketeering, perjury, collusion,\ncolor of law crimes, conspiracy to deprive Ms. Murphy of her legal\nproperty, conspiracy to deprive Ms. Murphy of the full enjoyment of\nher 30 acre farm, tampering with evidence in a criminal trial,\ntampering with the outcome of the trial by falsifying evidence and\nmore. These acts were committed willfully, knowingly with intent\nand malice aforethought for personal gain and for the gain of State\nof Maine allowing domestic terrorists free reign.\n. . .\n184. . . . Patterson of Clearwater testified that two calves that\ndied expired because they had no food and water. In fact those\nanimals had been purchased at auction and were dying when\npurchased. . . . Patterson had never asked the condition of the\nanimals when purchased from auction, and he did not know how long\nthey had been in Ms. Murphy's care. Additionally under the law Ms.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f          Dr. Patterson submitted a copy of Murphy's complaint to\n\nCentennial and requested that Centennial tender a defense on his\n\nbehalf, pursuant to the Policy.    Centennial denied Dr. Patterson's\n\nrequest on the ground that it did not have a duty to defend or\n\nindemnify Dr. Patterson with respect to the Murphy suit because the\n\nsuit fell outside the Policy's coverage.    Centennial then brought\n\nthe instant declaratory judgment action in the federal district\n\ncourt for the District of Maine, seeking a declaration that it did\n\nnot have an obligation to defend and indemnify Dr. Patterson\n\nagainst the claims asserted by Murphy.     Meanwhile, Dr. Patterson\n\nhired an attorney and provided for his own defense in the Murphy\n\nsuit.   On June 25, 2007, while Centennial's action was pending\n\nbefore the district court, Murphy's complaint was dismissed with\n\n\n\nMurphy as the legal owner of the animals did not give permission\nfor Patterson to do anything to her animals whether they were alive\nor dead. Patterson was working in collusion with . . . others in\nthe domestic terrorist racketeering scheme against Ms. Murphy.\n. . .   Patterson perjured himself on the witness stand. . . .\nPatterson is guilty of treating stolen animals without getting\npermission from the legal owner.      He is guilty of collusion,\nracketeering, tampering with evidence in a criminal trial,\ntampering with the jury, tampering with the disposition of a\ncriminal case and violating Ms. Murphy's right to an impartial\ntrial.   He failed to report the theft of her animals and the\nracketeering scheme to the proper authorities for investigation.\nAll are criminal acts.\n. . .\n185. . . . Patterson is guilty of perjury, theft of animals,\ntransporting stolen animals, receipt of stolen animals, tampering\nwith the jury, falsifying photographic evidence in a criminal\ntrial, tampering with the outcome of a criminal trial,\nracketeering, domestic terrorism, violating Ms. Murphy's U.S.\nConstitutional rights and more.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fprejudice.    Centennial's subsequent motion to dismiss this action\n\nas moot, based on the dismissal of the underlying suit, was denied\n\non grounds that a factual dispute remained over \"whether [Dr.\n\nPatterson] had incurred attorneys fees and costs and, if so, a\n\nlegal dispute over whether they are recoverable from the plaintiff\n\nunder a duty to defend.\"           The parties then each filed motions for\n\nsummary    judgment.        A    magistrate      judge   recommended     that   Dr.\n\nPatterson's      motion     for     summary      judgment     be    granted,    and\n\nCentennial's be denied, finding that Centennial had a duty under\n\nthe Policy to defend Dr. Patterson in the Murphy action.                         On\n\nMarch 26, 2006 the district court entered an order adopting that\n\nrecommendation.      At that point in time, Dr. Patterson had incurred\n\n$121.00 in attorney's fees defending himself in the underlying\n\nMurphy     action,   and    $3,036      in     connection    with     establishing\n\nCentennial's duty to defend in the instant suit.                    Centennial now\n\nappeals.\n\n                                  II.   Discussion\n\n            A.   Standard of Review\n\n            This     case       comes   before     us    under     our   diversity\n\njurisdiction and the parties agree that we must apply Maine law to\n\nthe resolution of the issues in dispute.                    See Douglas v. York\n\nCounty, 433 F.3d 143, 149           (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            We apply de novo review to the district court's decision\n\nbecause the issues were \"resolved on summary judgment and because\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\funder Maine law '[w]hether an insurer has an obligation to defend\n\nits insured against a complaint is a question of law.'\"                   Bucci v.\n\nEssex Ins. Co., 393 F.3d 285, 290 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Elliot\n\nv. Hanover Ins. Co., 711 A.2d 1310, 1312 (Me. 1998)) (alteration in\n\noriginal).\n\n            B.   Applicable Law\n\n            Both Centennial and Dr. Patterson agree that Maine law\n\nemploys the \"comparison test\" to determine whether an insurer has\n\na duty to defend an insured.           See Barrett Paving Materials, Inc. v.\n\nCont'l Ins. Co., 488 F.3d 59, 63 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing Travelers\n\nIndem. Co. v. Dingwell, 414 A.2d 220, 224 (Me. 1980)).                         \"The\n\nreviewing    court      is   required    to    '[lay]    the    underlying    damage\n\ncomplaint[ ] alongside the insurance policy and then determine[ ]\n\n[whether] the pleadings [are] adequate to encompass an occurrence\n\nwithin the coverage of the policy.'\"              Id. (quoting Dingwell, 414\n\nA.2d at 224) (modifications in original).                 \"Under this comparison\n\ntest, the insurer has a duty to defend if the underlying complaint\n\ndiscloses a 'potential or a possibility' for liability within the\n\npolicy's coverage.\"          Bucci, 393 F.3d at 290 (quoting Elliott, 711\n\nA.2d at 1312) (emphasis in original).                 In other words, \"'[g]iven\n\nthe possible existence of any legal or factual basis for payment\n\nunder a policy, an insurer's duty to defend should be decided\n\nsummarily in favor of the insured.'\"             Id. at 292 (quoting Gibson v.\n\nFarm   Family    Mut.    Ins.   Co.,    673    A.2d     1350,   1352   (Me.   1996))\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f(emphasis in original); see also NE Props., Inc. v. Chi. Title Ins.\n\nCo., 660 A.2d 926, 927 (Me. 1995) (\"The insured is entitled to a\n\ndefense if there exists any legal or factual basis which could be\n\ndeveloped at trial which would obligate the insurers to pay under\n\nthe policy.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).   \"Significantly,\n\n'[t]he duty to defend is broader than the duty to indemnify, and an\n\ninsurer may have to defend before it is clear whether there is a\n\nduty to indemnify.'\" Bucci, 393 F.3d at 292 (quoting Commercial\n\nUnion Ins. Co. v. Royal Ins. Co., 658 A.2d 1081, 1083 (Me. 1995)).\n\n          \"Maine law is very clear that the inquiry [under the\n\ncomparison test] 'is based exclusively on the facts as alleged\n\nrather than on the facts as they actually are.'\"    Barrett Paving,\n\n488 F.3d at 63 (quoting Dingwell, 414 A.2d at 224).   Moreover, we\n\nnote that under Maine law, at least in some circumstances, \"the\n\nduty of an insurance company to defend one count in a lawsuit\n\nimposes a duty to defend all counts.\"   Gibson, 673 A.2d at 1354.\n\nFinally, as a general rule, \"a standard policy of insurance\" under\n\nMaine law must be interpreted \"most strongly against the insurer.\"\n\nId. at 1353 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          C.   Potential for Coverage within Scope of Policy\n\n          Centennial argues that it had no duty to defend Dr.\n\nPatterson in the Murphy action because the Murphy complaint did not\n\nallege a \"veterinary incident,\" as the term is defined in the\n\nPolicy.   As noted above, the Policy defines \"veterinary incident\"\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fas \"any malpractice, negligent act or omission, utterance or\n\npublication     of   a     libel    or       slander,       or   other   defamatory   or\n\ndisparaging material . . . [i]n the furnishing of professional\n\nveterinary     services.\"          In    support       of    its    position   that   no\n\n\"veterinary incident\" was alleged, Centennial argues that (a) the\n\nMurphy complaint makes no claims of malpractice or negligence in\n\nthe \"furnishing of professional veterinary services\" and that (b)\n\nthe   Murphy    complaint     makes          no    claims    of    libel,   slander   or\n\ndefamation against Dr. Patterson - but only against certain media\n\noutlets.    We disagree.\n\n            As to Centennial's first argument, it is true that the\n\nMurphy complaint does not explicitly assert that Dr. Patterson was\n\nnegligent      or    committed      malpractice             in    the    furnishing   of\n\nprofessional veterinary services.                    However, the complaint does\n\ncontain several allegations of wrongful conduct by Dr. Patterson\n\nthat could \"potentially\" be so construed.\n\n            As a threshold matter, we reject Centennial's contention\n\nthat the claims asserted against Dr. Patterson related \"exclusively\n\nto Dr. Patterson's testimony at the Animal Possession Hearing.\"\n\nRather, Murphy's statement, at paragraph 184 of the complaint, that\n\nDr. Patterson \"testified that two calves that died expired because\n\nthey had no food and water\" implies that Dr. Patterson examined the\n\ndeceased    calves    in    order       to    reach     a   professional     conclusion\n\nregarding their cause of death, and that Murphy's claims arise, in\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\fpart, from that examination.            This inference, that Dr. Patterson\n\nexamined the animals, is further supported by Murphy's statement\n\nthat she \"did not give permission to Patterson to do anything to\n\nher   animals   whether    they   were    alive   or   dead.\"      Furthermore,\n\nMurphy's allegation that \"Patterson is guilty of treating stolen\n\nanimals without getting permission from the legal owner,\" is a\n\nclaim against Dr. Patterson which does not arise solely from his\n\ntestimony   against   Murphy      but    also   from   actions   taken   by   Dr.\n\nPatterson toward Murphy's animals, either when they were living, or\n\nafter they had died.\n\n            Taken together, Murphy's allegations suggest that Dr.\n\nPatterson not only testified against Murphy, but performed some\n\ntype of professional veterinary service on Murphy's animals, which\n\nMurphy regarded as wrongful in being carried out without her\n\nauthorization, wrongful in approach (because Dr. Patterson did not\n\nask her about the calves' origin and prior condition), and wrongful\n\nin result (because Dr. Patterson erroneously faulted Murphy for\n\ntheir death).     As such, Murphy's complaint can be construed as\n\nincluding    claims   arising      out     of   veterinary      malpractice   or\n\nnegligence; claims which, if proven, potentially fall within the\n\nPolicy's coverage.        We reiterate that a \"potential\" of a \"claim\n\nwithin the policy\" is all that is required, under Maine law, to\n\ntrigger Centennial's duty to defend.              See J.A.J., Inc. v. Aetna\n\nCas. & Sur. Co., 529 A.2d 806, 808 (Me. 1987) (stating that \"[i]t\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fis not essential that the complaint specifically and unequivocally\n\nmake out a claim within the policy\" but only that it raise \"a\n\npotential . . . that the facts ultimately proved may come within\n\nthe coverage\").\n\n          We hold that the allegations of the complaint contain\n\nsufficient facts to state a claim of negligence or malpractice\n\npotentially covered by the Policy.         We need not go any further, as\n\nthis conclusion is sufficient to activate Centennial's duty to\n\ndefend Dr. Patterson in the underlying suit. Nevertheless, we also\n\nhold, contrary to Centennial's assertions, that the duty to defend\n\nis independently triggered by our view that Murphy potentially\n\nalleged that Dr. Patterson, among other defendants, committed libel\n\nand slander against her.\n\n          The Policy language clearly includes within the scope of\n\ncoverage claims against the insured alleging the \"utterance or\n\npublication   of   a   libel   or   slander,   or   other   defamatory   or\n\ndisparaging material . . . in the furnishing of professional\n\nveterinary services.\"      Centennial disputes the applicability of\n\nthis provision by arguing that Murphy's allegations of libel,\n\nslander and defamation were directed at defendants in the complaint\n\nother than Dr. Patterson, namely, certain media outlets that\n\npublished newspaper accounts of the proceedings against Murphy.\n\nThis is certainly one plausible interpretation of the complaint, in\n\nthat the specific claims of libel and slander enumerated in the\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fcomplaint       were   directed      towards        various     media    outlets.2\n\nNevertheless,      there   is    another    plausible    interpretation.        In\n\nparagraph 2 of her complaint, Murphy makes general claims of libel\n\nand slander which, at paragraph 1, she directs towards \"State\n\nOfficials and others.\"          Based on these broadly worded provisions,\n\nthe complaint may be reasonably construed as potentially stating a\n\ndefamation claim against any of the defendants, including Dr.\n\nPatterson.      See Dingwell, 414 A.2d at 227 (noting that with \"the\n\ngreat latitude with which pleadings are construed today, and the\n\ngreat latitude of amendment, an insured's right to a defense should\n\nnot be foreclosed unless such a result is inescapably necessary\"\n\n(quoting Donnelly v. Transp. Ins. Co., 589 F.2d 761, 765 (4th Cir.\n\n1978)).     Moreover, this construction of paragraph 2's libel and\n\nslander claim as potentially applicable to Dr. Patterson, is\n\nbolstered by the language of the complaint at paragraph 129, where\n\nMurphy alleges that Dr. Patterson provided untruthful and damaging\n\ntestimony against her at the animal repossession hearing.                 Reading\n\nthese portions of the complaint together, we can reasonably infer\n\nthat   Murphy    may   have     intended    to   state   a    claim   against   Dr.\n\nPatterson    for   defamation      --   a   claim    that,    if   proven,   would\n\n\n2\n   For example, at paragraph 151 of the Complaint Murphy alleges\nthat the Morning Sentinel newspaper committed \"libel and slander\"\nby \"print[ing] the story without checking their facts.\" At para.\n157 of the Complaint Murphy makes similar claims against the\nKennebec Journal, alleging that this publication was also \"guilty\nof libel and slander\" in printing a story about the conditions on\nMurphy's farm.\n\n                                        -12-\n\fpotentially trigger coverage under the Policy.

Co., 699 A.2d 1153,\n\n1156 (Me. 1997) (\"'Even a complaint which is legally insufficient\n\nto withstand a motion to dismiss gives rise to a duty to defend if\n\nit   shows   an    intent   to   state   a   claim   within   the   insurance\n\ncoverage.'\" (quoting Dingwell, 414 A.2d at 226) (emphasis added)).\n\nFinally, that Murphy had such intent is supported by the overall\n\nnature of the complaint, which evidences a general intent on the\n\npart of the pro se plaintiff to state the broadest array of claims\n\nagainst the greatest number of potential defendants, in hopes of\n\nmaximizing the potential for recovery.\n\n             Centennial further disputes the applicability of the\n\n\"libel and slander\" provision on grounds that any libel or slander\n\nalleged to have been committed by Dr. Patterson took place during\n\nhis testimony at the Hearing, and thus, was not delivered \"in the\n\nfurnishing of professional veterinary services,\" as required to\n\ntrigger coverage under the Policy.           Centennial suggests that the\n\nfurnishing of \"professional veterinary services\" must necessarily\n\ninvolve some form of malpractice or negligence in the treatment of\n\nan animal.        However, we hold that the Policy definition, which\n\nspecifically includes within the scope of coverage the \"utterance\n\nor publication of a libel or slander,\" an event which, as noted by\n\nthe district court is \"unlikely to occur while a veterinarian is\n\nphysically treating an animal,\" suggests that the provision has\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fbroader applicability.          In any event, courts interpreting the term\n\n\"professional services\" in the context of determining coverage\n\nunder an insurance policy have generally defined the term broadly,\n\nso as to embrace all activities for which the specialized training\n\nof the particular profession is required.             See, e.g., Med. Records\n\nAssoc., Inc. v. Am. Empire Surplus Lines Ins., 142 F.3d 512, 515\n\n(1st    Cir.     1998)    (defining      \"professional         services\"      under\n\nMassachusetts law as \"embrac[ing] those activities that distinguish\n\na particular occupation from other occupations -- as evidenced by\n\nthe need for specialized learning or training -- and from the\n\nordinary activities of life and business\"); W. World Ins. Co. v.\n\nAm. & Foreign Ins. Co., 180 F. Supp. 2d 224, 231 (D. Me. 2002)\n\n(defining \"'professional' act or service\" under Maine law as \"one\n\narising out of a vocation, calling, occupation, or employment\n\ninvolving specialized knowledge, labor, or skill\" (quoting Marx v.\n\nHartford Accident & Indem. Co., 157 N.W.2d 870, 871-72 (Neb.\n\n1968)).    Thus, we agree with the district court that \"[Patterson]\n\ncould     only   have    been    testifying     in    that     proceeding     as   a\n\nveterinarian,\" that \"[t]estifying as a professional veterinarian,\n\nas an expert witness, must logically be included in the scope of\n\n'professional      veterinary       services'        [absent     an   applicable\n\nexclusion],\" and therefore, Dr. Patterson's \"act of testifying\n\nconstituted 'the furnishing of professional veterinary services'\n\nwithin the meaning of that term as used in the policy.\"                     We thus\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\ffind that at least some of the claims against Dr. Patterson\n\ncontained in the Murphy complaint arise out of a \"veterinary\n\nincident,\" and as a result, potentially fall within the scope of\n\ncoverage.\n\n            D.    Effect of Policy Exclusions\n\n            Alternatively, Centennial argues that it had no duty to\n\ndefend Dr. Patterson because it was relieved of any such duty by\n\nExclusion H in the Policy, a provision which excludes from coverage\n\nany suit arising out of or related to \"[a]ny actual or alleged\n\n. . . dishonest, fraudulent, criminal, malicious act, or malicious\n\nomission\" or any \"willfull violation\" by the insured.                        Centennial\n\ncontends that, even if the allegations in the Murphy complaint do\n\narise out of an otherwise covered veterinary incident, \"[a]ll of\n\nthe allegations against Patterson describe dishonest, fraudulent or\n\ncriminal conduct on his part,\" and thus, fall within the scope of\n\nExclusion H.      According to Centennial, \"there is no potential that\n\nPatterson's       alleged    conduct     did     not        involve    a     dishonest,\n\nfraudulent,      criminal,     malicious   act,        or    malicious       omission.\"\n\nCentennial acknowledges that a full trial might have ultimately\n\ndisclosed     that   Dr.     Patterson's       actions       were     not,    in    fact,\n\ndishonest,       fraudulent,    or     criminal,       but      argues       that    such\n\nconsiderations are irrelevant under the comparison test, which\n\nhinges the duty to defend \"exclusively on the facts as alleged\n\nrather than on the facts as they actually are.\"                       Barrett Paving,\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\f488 F.3d at 63 (emphasis added & internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe     \"triggering     of    Exclusion     H,\"   according       to   Centennial,\n\n\"eliminates any potential for coverage under the [Policy].\"\n\n            We disagree with the premise upon which Centennial's\n\nargument    rests      --    that   there   was    \"no   potential\"     that   the\n\nallegations against Patterson involved a claim not barred under\n\nExclusion H.      It is true that many of Murphy's claims, albeit in a\n\nconclusory manner, allege that Patterson committed various crimes,\n\nsuch as racketeering and perjury.             If proven, these would clearly\n\nfall within the exclusion and therefore, outside the scope of\n\ncoverage. Nevertheless, it is not essential, under Maine law, that\n\nall claims against the insured in the underlying complaint raise\n\nthe possibility of coverage for the insurer's duty to defend to be\n\ntriggered, at least where the claims arise from common issues of\n\nfact.    See Gibson, 673 A.2d at 1354.\n\n            As explained above, we find that Murphy's complaint can\n\nbe    construed   to   also    state   claims     against   Dr.    Patterson   for\n\nslander, libel, negligence and malpractice -- claims which, if\n\nproven, would fall outside the scope of Exclusion H, and at least\n\npotentially, within the scope of coverage.               The fact that Murphy\n\nalso alleged that Dr. Patterson committed various uncovered crimes\n\nin the course of the single factual scenario at issue, does not,\n\nunder Gibson, relieve Centennial of the duty to defend.                        Id.\n\nMoreover, the fact that Murphy, a pro se plaintiff bringing a civil\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\faction and seeking damages, characterizes all of Dr. Patterson's\n\nactions as \"criminal acts\" (paragraph 184 of the complaint), and\n\nuses words such as \"guilty\" rather than \"liable\" to describe\n\nPatterson's culpability, does not mean that Murphy, has, in fact,\n\nalleged criminal conduct.     See Dingwell, 414 A.2d at 226 (\"Whether\n\n[the insured] can obtain a defense from his insurer must depend not\n\non the caprice of the plaintiff's draftsmanship, nor the limits of\n\nhis knowledge, but on a potential shown in the complaint that the\n\nfacts   ultimately   proved    may   come   within   the   coverage.\").\n\nRegardless of how Murphy chooses to classify Dr. Patterson's\n\nallegedly wrongful conduct, \"the facts ultimately proved\" could\n\nhave potentially shown, for example, that Patterson was negligent\n\nin concluding that Murphy had caused the death of her calves, or\n\nthat Patterson's statements regarding Murphy's treatment of her\n\nanimals were defamatory, both non-criminal wrongs which could\n\npotentially \"come within [the Policy's] coverage.\"         See J.A.J.,\n\nInc., 529 A.2d at 808 (quoting Dingwell, 414 A.2d at 226).\n\n          Ultimately, Maine law \"place[s] the burden of uncertainty\n\nas to the policy's coverage on the insurer.\"     Dingwell, 414 A.2d at\n\n227 (citation omitted).   Because we find that Exclusion H does not\n\nnecessarily foreclose coverage under the Policy, we hold that Dr.\n\nPatterson's right to a defense remains intact.\n\n          Based on the allegations in the Murphy complaint, we hold\n\nthat the Centennial Policy potentially covered Murphy's claims\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fagainst Dr. Patterson, and therefore, Centennial had a duty to\n\ndefend its insured. Because we conclude that Centennial had a duty\n\nto defend, we further conclude that the district court correctly\n\ngranted summary judgment for Dr. Patterson.\n\n          E.   Attorney's Fees\n\n          Dr. Patterson contends that if he prevails in defending\n\nagainst the instant declaratory judgment action, he is entitled to\n\nrecover not only the costs of his defense in the Murphy suit, but\n\nalso the costs of establishing Centennial's duty to defend in this\n\naction.\n\n          Maine law provides by statute that \"when there is a\n\ndeclaratory judgment action 'to determine an insurer's contractual\n\nduty to defend an insured under an insurance policy, if the insured\n\nprevails in such action, the insurer shall pay court costs and\n\nreasonable attorney's fees.'\"    Foremost Ins. Co. v. Levesque, 926\n\nA.2d 1185, 1188 (Me. 2007) (quoting 24-A M.R.S. § 2436-B(2)).\n\nHowever, we find, as did the district court, that Dr. Patterson's\n\nrequest for attorney's fees remains premature.   See D. Me. R. 54.2\n\n(providing that application for attorney's fees \"shall be filed\n\nwithin 30 days of the filing of the appellate mandate providing for\n\nthe final disposition of any appeal to the Court of Appeals\").\n\nThus, we leave it to the district court to resolve this issue at\n\nthe appropriate time.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\f                        III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, the summary judgment entered\n\nin favor of Patterson and against Centennial is affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -19-\n\f",

The    district     court    declared   that   Centennial   was\n\nobligated under an insurance policy to legally defend Patterson in\n\na lawsuit instituted against him by Carol Murphy.              After careful\n\nconsideration, we affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of\n\nPatterson.\n\n                              I.    Background\n\n            For the purposes of summary judgment the facts are as\n\nfollows.   Centennial is a New York insurance company authorized to\n\ndo business in Maine.       Dr. Patterson is a doctor of veterinary\n\nmedicine who practices in Maine.            Centennial provided insurance\n\ncoverage to Patterson pursuant to a Veterinarian's Professional\n\nLiability Policy in effect between the parties during the period\n\nJanuary 1, 2003 through January 1, 2005 (\"the Policy\").\n\n            The Policy states, in relevant part:\n\n            II.   Defense,    Settlement,   Supplementary\n            Payments\n            With respect to such insurance as is afforded\n            by this certificate:\n            A. The Company shall have the right and duty\n            to investigate any Claim or defend any Suit\n            brought against the Insured alleging a\n            Veterinary Incident and seeking damages on\n            account thereof, to which this insurance\n            applies, even if such Claim or Suit is\n            groundless, false, or fraudulent. . . .\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f          Common Certificate Definitions Form\n          D. Claim means any of the following: . . .\n                 2. A Suit, arbitration or other\n          proceeding served on an Insured for damages\n          resulting from a Veterinary Incident.\n          . . .\n          M. Veterinary Incident means any malpractice,\n          negligent act or omission, utterance or\n          publication of a libel or slander, or other\n          defamatory or disparaging material:\n                 1. in the furnishing of professional\n          veterinary services, . . . by the Named\n          Insured or by any person for whom the Named\n          Insured is legally responsible.\n          . . .\n\nRelevant to this dispute, the Policy also contains the following\n\nexclusions:\n\n          III. Exclusions\n          This certificate does not apply to Claim or\n          Suit based upon, arising out of, or related\n          to: . . .\n          H. any actual or alleged;\n          1. dishonest, fraudulent, criminal, malicious\n          act, or malicious omission by any Insured;\n          2. willful violation of any law, statute,\n          ordinance, rule or regulation by any Insured.\n\n          In September 2006, Murphy initiated a pro se civil action\n\nin federal court against the State of Maine and eighty or more\n\ndefendants,   including   Dr.   Patterson,   alleging   various   claims\n\narising from proceedings brought against Murphy by the State of\n\nMaine for animal cruelty.       Murphy had been charged by the State\n\nwith animal cruelty for not providing proper food, water, or\n\nshelter to approximately sixty animals on her farm.         She sought\n\n\"compensatory and punitive damages\" and injunctive relief, namely,\n\nthe \"return of all [her] property.\"\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\f           The claims against Dr. Patterson arose from his alleged\n\ntestimony against Murphy at an Animal Possession Hearing, which was\n\nheld on March 19, 2004 (the \"Hearing\"), and also, Dr. Patterson's\n\nalleged   examination   of   her   animals   in   connection   with   those\n\nproceedings.1\n\n\n1\n   Murphy's complaint, a 60-page document labeled \"Second Amended\nJudicial Brief,\" included the following claims:\n\n1.   This action is brought by the Plaintiff . . . to remedy\n[various violations] by State Officials and others . . . that\ndeprived CAROL MURPHY . . . of rights, privileges or immunities\nsecured or legally protected by the United States Constitution and\nAmendments, Civil Rights and Human Rights and the laws of the\nUnited States.\n\n2. These specifically include but are not limited to those rights,\nprivileges and immunities found in and secured and/or protected by\nthe Constitution [and various provisions therein]. . . also the\nConstitutional right to be protected from . . . perjury and\nsubornation of perjury, libel, slander, malfeasance, misfeasance,\nnonfeasance . . . etc. . . .\n\n129. . . . DR. PATTERSON D.V.M. . . . of CLEARWATER VETERINARY\nHOSPITAL . . . testified [at the Animal Possession Hearing] that\nMs. Murphy's animals were in horrible condition, no veterinary\ncare, no food, no water, were filthy, that the house had six inches\nof feces on the floors and that the animals had received no food or\nwater for months. This is again racketeering, perjury, collusion,\ncolor of law crimes, conspiracy to deprive Ms. Murphy of her legal\nproperty, conspiracy to deprive Ms. Murphy of the full enjoyment of\nher 30 acre farm, tampering with evidence in a criminal trial,\ntampering with the outcome of the trial by falsifying evidence and\nmore. These acts were committed willfully, knowingly with intent\nand malice aforethought for personal gain and for the gain of State\nof Maine allowing domestic terrorists free reign.\n. . .\n184. . . . Patterson of Clearwater testified that two calves that\ndied expired because they had no food and water. In fact those\nanimals had been purchased at auction and were dying when\npurchased. . . . Patterson had never asked the condition of the\nanimals when purchased from auction, and he did not know how long\nthey had been in Ms. Murphy's care. Additionally under the law Ms.\n\n                                    -4-\n\f          Dr. Patterson submitted a copy of Murphy's complaint to\n\nCentennial and requested that Centennial tender a defense on his\n\nbehalf, pursuant to the Policy.    Centennial denied Dr. Patterson's\n\nrequest on the ground that it did not have a duty to defend or\n\nindemnify Dr. Patterson with respect to the Murphy suit because the\n\nsuit fell outside the Policy's coverage.    Centennial then brought\n\nthe instant declaratory judgment action in the federal district\n\ncourt for the District of Maine, seeking a declaration that it did\n\nnot have an obligation to defend and indemnify Dr. Patterson\n\nagainst the claims asserted by Murphy.     Meanwhile, Dr. Patterson\n\nhired an attorney and provided for his own defense in the Murphy\n\nsuit.   On June 25, 2007, while Centennial's action was pending\n\nbefore the district court, Murphy's complaint was dismissed with\n\n\n\nMurphy as the legal owner of the animals did not give permission\nfor Patterson to do anything to her animals whether they were alive\nor dead. Patterson was working in collusion with . . . others in\nthe domestic terrorist racketeering scheme against Ms. Murphy.\n. . .   Patterson perjured himself on the witness stand. . . .\nPatterson is guilty of treating stolen animals without getting\npermission from the legal owner.      He is guilty of collusion,\nracketeering, tampering with evidence in a criminal trial,\ntampering with the jury, tampering with the disposition of a\ncriminal case and violating Ms. Murphy's right to an impartial\ntrial.   He failed to report the theft of her animals and the\nracketeering scheme to the proper authorities for investigation.\nAll are criminal acts.\n. . .\n185. . . . Patterson is guilty of perjury, theft of animals,\ntransporting stolen animals, receipt of stolen animals, tampering\nwith the jury, falsifying photographic evidence in a criminal\ntrial, tampering with the outcome of a criminal trial,\nracketeering, domestic terrorism, violating Ms. Murphy's U.S.\nConstitutional rights and more.\n\n                                  -5-\n\fprejudice.    Centennial's subsequent motion to dismiss this action\n\nas moot, based on the dismissal of the underlying suit, was denied\n\non grounds that a factual dispute remained over \"whether [Dr.\n\nPatterson] had incurred attorneys fees and costs and, if so, a\n\nlegal dispute over whether they are recoverable from the plaintiff\n\nunder a duty to defend.\"           The parties then each filed motions for\n\nsummary    judgment.        A    magistrate      judge   recommended     that   Dr.\n\nPatterson's      motion     for     summary      judgment     be    granted,    and\n\nCentennial's be denied, finding that Centennial had a duty under\n\nthe Policy to defend Dr. Patterson in the Murphy action.                         On\n\nMarch 26, 2006 the district court entered an order adopting that\n\nrecommendation.      At that point in time, Dr. Patterson had incurred\n\n$121.00 in attorney's fees defending himself in the underlying\n\nMurphy     action,   and    $3,036      in     connection    with     establishing\n\nCentennial's duty to defend in the instant suit.                    Centennial now\n\nappeals.\n\n                                  II.   Discussion\n\n            A.

Moreover, we\n\nnote that under Maine law, at least in some circumstances, \"the\n\nduty of an insurance company to defend one count in a lawsuit\n\nimposes a duty to defend all counts.\"   Gibson, 673 A.2d at 1354.\n\nFinally, as a general rule, \"a standard policy of insurance\" under\n\nMaine law must be interpreted \"most strongly against the insurer.\"\n\nId. at 1353 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n          C.   Potential for Coverage within Scope of Policy\n\n          Centennial argues that it had no duty to defend Dr.\n\nPatterson in the Murphy action because the Murphy complaint did not\n\nallege a \"veterinary incident,\" as the term is defined in the\n\nPolicy.   As noted above, the Policy defines \"veterinary incident\"\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fas \"any malpractice, negligent act or omission, utterance or\n\npublication     of   a     libel    or       slander,       or   other   defamatory   or\n\ndisparaging material . . . [i]n the furnishing of professional\n\nveterinary     services.\"          In    support       of    its    position   that   no\n\n\"veterinary incident\" was alleged, Centennial argues that (a) the\n\nMurphy complaint makes no claims of malpractice or negligence in\n\nthe \"furnishing of professional veterinary services\" and that (b)\n\nthe   Murphy    complaint     makes          no    claims    of    libel,   slander   or\n\ndefamation against Dr. Patterson - but only against certain media\n\noutlets.    We disagree.\n\n            As to Centennial's first argument, it is true that the\n\nMurphy complaint does not explicitly assert that Dr. Patterson was\n\nnegligent      or    committed      malpractice             in    the    furnishing   of\n\nprofessional veterinary services.                    However, the complaint does\n\ncontain several allegations of wrongful conduct by Dr. Patterson\n\nthat could \"potentially\" be so construed.\n\n            As a threshold matter, we reject Centennial's contention\n\nthat the claims asserted against Dr. Patterson related \"exclusively\n\nto Dr. Patterson's testimony at the Animal Possession Hearing.\"\n\nRather, Murphy's statement, at paragraph 184 of the complaint, that\n\nDr. Patterson \"testified that two calves that died expired because\n\nthey had no food and water\" implies that Dr. Patterson examined the\n\ndeceased    calves    in    order       to    reach     a   professional     conclusion\n\nregarding their cause of death, and that Murphy's claims arise, in\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\fpart, from that examination.            This inference, that Dr. Patterson\n\nexamined the animals, is further supported by Murphy's statement\n\nthat she \"did not give permission to Patterson to do anything to\n\nher   animals   whether    they   were    alive   or   dead.\"      Furthermore,\n\nMurphy's allegation that \"Patterson is guilty of treating stolen\n\nanimals without getting permission from the legal owner,\" is a\n\nclaim against Dr. Patterson which does not arise solely from his\n\ntestimony   against   Murphy      but    also   from   actions   taken   by   Dr.\n\nPatterson toward Murphy's animals, either when they were living, or\n\nafter they had died.\n\n            Taken together, Murphy's allegations suggest that Dr.\n\nPatterson not only testified against Murphy, but performed some\n\ntype of professional veterinary service on Murphy's animals, which\n\nMurphy regarded as wrongful in being carried out without her\n\nauthorization, wrongful in approach (because Dr. Patterson did not\n\nask her about the calves' origin and prior condition), and wrongful\n\nin result (because Dr. Patterson erroneously faulted Murphy for\n\ntheir death).     As such, Murphy's complaint can be construed as\n\nincluding    claims   arising      out     of   veterinary      malpractice   or\n\nnegligence; claims which, if proven, potentially fall within the\n\nPolicy's coverage.        We reiterate that a \"potential\" of a \"claim\n\nwithin the policy\" is all that is required, under Maine law, to\n\ntrigger Centennial's duty to defend.              See J.A.J., Inc. v. Aetna\n\nCas. & Sur. Co., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">529</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">806</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 808 (Me. 1987) (stating that \"[i]t\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fis not essential that the complaint specifically and unequivocally\n\nmake out a claim within the policy\" but only that it raise \"a\n\npotential . . . that the facts ultimately proved may come within\n\nthe coverage\").\n\n          We hold that the allegations of the complaint contain\n\nsufficient facts to state a claim of negligence or malpractice\n\npotentially covered by the Policy.         We need not go any further, as\n\nthis conclusion is sufficient to activate Centennial's duty to\n\ndefend Dr. Patterson in the underlying suit. Nevertheless, we also\n\nhold, contrary to Centennial's assertions, that the duty to defend\n\nis independently triggered by our view that Murphy potentially\n\nalleged that Dr. Patterson, among other defendants, committed libel\n\nand slander against her.\n\n          The Policy language clearly includes within the scope of\n\ncoverage claims against the insured alleging the \"utterance or\n\npublication   of   a   libel   or   slander,   or   other   defamatory   or\n\ndisparaging material . . . in the furnishing of professional\n\nveterinary services.\"      Centennial disputes the applicability of\n\nthis provision by arguing that Murphy's allegations of libel,\n\nslander and defamation were directed at defendants in the complaint\n\nother than Dr. Patterson, namely, certain media outlets that\n\npublished newspaper accounts of the proceedings against Murphy.\n\nThis is certainly one plausible interpretation of the complaint, in\n\nthat the specific claims of libel and slander enumerated in the\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fcomplaint       were   directed      towards        various     media    outlets.2\n\nNevertheless,      there   is    another    plausible    interpretation.        In\n\nparagraph 2 of her complaint, Murphy makes general claims of libel\n\nand slander which, at paragraph 1, she directs towards \"State\n\nOfficials and others.\"          Based on these broadly worded provisions,\n\nthe complaint may be reasonably construed as potentially stating a\n\ndefamation claim against any of the defendants, including Dr.\n\nPatterson.      See Dingwell, 414 A.2d at 227 (noting that with \"the\n\ngreat latitude with which pleadings are construed today, and the\n\ngreat latitude of amendment, an insured's right to a defense should\n\nnot be foreclosed unless such a result is inescapably necessary\"\n\n(quoting Donnelly v.

Moreover, this construction of paragraph 2's libel and\n\nslander claim as potentially applicable to Dr. Patterson, is\n\nbolstered by the language of the complaint at paragraph 129, where\n\nMurphy alleges that Dr. Patterson provided untruthful and damaging\n\ntestimony against her at the animal repossession hearing.                 Reading\n\nthese portions of the complaint together, we can reasonably infer\n\nthat   Murphy    may   have     intended    to   state   a    claim   against   Dr.\n\nPatterson    for   defamation      --   a   claim    that,    if   proven,   would\n\n\n2\n   For example, at paragraph 151 of the Complaint Murphy alleges\nthat the Morning Sentinel newspaper committed \"libel and slander\"\nby \"print[ing] the story without checking their facts.\" At para.\n157 of the Complaint Murphy makes similar claims against the\nKennebec Journal, alleging that this publication was also \"guilty\nof libel and slander\" in printing a story about the conditions on\nMurphy's farm.\n\n                                        -12-\n\fpotentially trigger coverage under the Policy.

Centennial suggests that the\n\nfurnishing of \"professional veterinary services\" must necessarily\n\ninvolve some form of malpractice or negligence in the treatment of\n\nan animal.        However, we hold that the Policy definition, which\n\nspecifically includes within the scope of coverage the \"utterance\n\nor publication of a libel or slander,\" an event which, as noted by\n\nthe district court is \"unlikely to occur while a veterinarian is\n\nphysically treating an animal,\" suggests that the provision has\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fbroader applicability.          In any event, courts interpreting the term\n\n\"professional services\" in the context of determining coverage\n\nunder an insurance policy have generally defined the term broadly,\n\nso as to embrace all activities for which the specialized training\n\nof the particular profession is required.

Thus, we agree with the district court that \"[Patterson]\n\ncould     only   have    been    testifying     in    that     proceeding     as   a\n\nveterinarian,\" that \"[t]estifying as a professional veterinarian,\n\nas an expert witness, must logically be included in the scope of\n\n'professional      veterinary       services'        [absent     an   applicable\n\nexclusion],\" and therefore, Dr. Patterson's \"act of testifying\n\nconstituted 'the furnishing of professional veterinary services'\n\nwithin the meaning of that term as used in the policy.\"                     We thus\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\ffind that at least some of the claims against Dr. Patterson\n\ncontained in the Murphy complaint arise out of a \"veterinary\n\nincident,\" and as a result, potentially fall within the scope of\n\ncoverage.\n\n            D.    Effect of Policy Exclusions\n\n            Alternatively, Centennial argues that it had no duty to\n\ndefend Dr. Patterson because it was relieved of any such duty by\n\nExclusion H in the Policy, a provision which excludes from coverage\n\nany suit arising out of or related to \"[a]ny actual or alleged\n\n. . . dishonest, fraudulent, criminal, malicious act, or malicious\n\nomission\" or any \"willfull violation\" by the insured.                        Centennial\n\ncontends that, even if the allegations in the Murphy complaint do\n\narise out of an otherwise covered veterinary incident, \"[a]ll of\n\nthe allegations against Patterson describe dishonest, fraudulent or\n\ncriminal conduct on his part,\" and thus, fall within the scope of\n\nExclusion H.      According to Centennial, \"there is no potential that\n\nPatterson's       alleged    conduct     did     not        involve    a     dishonest,\n\nfraudulent,      criminal,     malicious   act,        or    malicious       omission.\"\n\nCentennial acknowledges that a full trial might have ultimately\n\ndisclosed     that   Dr.     Patterson's       actions       were     not,    in    fact,\n\ndishonest,       fraudulent,    or     criminal,       but      argues       that    such\n\nconsiderations are irrelevant under the comparison test, which\n\nhinges the duty to defend \"exclusively on the facts as alleged\n\nrather than on the facts as they actually are.\"                       Barrett Paving,\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\f488 F.3d at 63 (emphasis added & internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe     \"triggering     of    Exclusion     H,\"   according       to   Centennial,\n\n\"eliminates any potential for coverage under the [Policy].\"\n\n            We disagree with the premise upon which Centennial's\n\nargument    rests      --    that   there   was    \"no   potential\"     that   the\n\nallegations against Patterson involved a claim not barred under\n\nExclusion H.      It is true that many of Murphy's claims, albeit in a\n\nconclusory manner, allege that Patterson committed various crimes,\n\nsuch as racketeering and perjury.             If proven, these would clearly\n\nfall within the exclusion and therefore, outside the scope of\n\ncoverage. Nevertheless, it is not essential, under Maine law, that\n\nall claims against the insured in the underlying complaint raise\n\nthe possibility of coverage for the insurer's duty to defend to be\n\ntriggered, at least where the claims arise from common issues of\n\nfact.    See Gibson, 673 A.2d at 1354.\n\n            As explained above, we find that Murphy's complaint can\n\nbe    construed   to   also    state   claims     against   Dr.    Patterson   for\n\nslander, libel, negligence and malpractice -- claims which, if\n\nproven, would fall outside the scope of Exclusion H, and at least\n\npotentially, within the scope of coverage.               The fact that Murphy\n\nalso alleged that Dr. Patterson committed various uncovered crimes\n\nin the course of the single factual scenario at issue, does not,\n\nunder Gibson, relieve Centennial of the duty to defend.                        Id.\n\nMoreover, the fact that Murphy, a pro se plaintiff bringing a civil\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\faction and seeking damages, characterizes all of Dr. Patterson's\n\nactions as \"criminal acts\" (paragraph 184 of the complaint), and\n\nuses words such as \"guilty\" rather than \"liable\" to describe\n\nPatterson's culpability, does not mean that Murphy, has, in fact,\n\nalleged criminal conduct.     See Dingwell, 414 A.2d at 226 (\"Whether\n\n[the insured] can obtain a defense from his insurer must depend not\n\non the caprice of the plaintiff's draftsmanship, nor the limits of\n\nhis knowledge, but on a potential shown in the complaint that the\n\nfacts   ultimately   proved    may   come   within   the   coverage.\").\n\nRegardless of how Murphy chooses to classify Dr. Patterson's\n\nallegedly wrongful conduct, \"the facts ultimately proved\" could\n\nhave potentially shown, for example, that Patterson was negligent\n\nin concluding that Murphy had caused the death of her calves, or\n\nthat Patterson's statements regarding Murphy's treatment of her\n\nanimals were defamatory, both non-criminal wrongs which could\n\npotentially \"come within [the Policy's] coverage.\"         See J.A.J.,\n\nInc., 529 A.2d at 808 (quoting Dingwell, 414 A.2d at 226).\n\n          Ultimately, Maine law \"place[s] the burden of uncertainty\n\nas to the policy's coverage on the insurer.\"     Dingwell, 414 A.2d at\n\n227 (citation omitted).   Because we find that Exclusion H does not\n\nnecessarily foreclose coverage under the Policy, we hold that Dr.\n\nPatterson's right to a defense remains intact.\n\n          Based on the allegations in the Murphy complaint, we hold\n\nthat the Centennial Policy potentially covered Murphy's claims\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fagainst Dr. Patterson, and therefore, Centennial had a duty to\n\ndefend its insured. Because we conclude that Centennial had a duty\n\nto defend, we further conclude that the district court correctly\n\ngranted summary judgment for Dr. Patterson.\n\n          E.   Attorney's Fees\n\n          Dr. Patterson contends that if he prevails in defending\n\nagainst the instant declaratory judgment action, he is entitled to\n\nrecover not only the costs of his defense in the Murphy suit, but\n\nalso the costs of establishing Centennial's duty to defend in this\n\naction.\n\n          Maine law provides by statute that \"when there is a\n\ndeclaratory judgment action 'to determine an insurer's contractual\n\nduty to defend an insured under an insurance policy, if the insured\n\nprevails in such action, the insurer shall pay court costs and\n\nreasonable attorney's fees.'\"    Foremost Ins.
