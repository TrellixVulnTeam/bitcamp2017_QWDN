The overriding issue in\n\nthis diversity case governed by Puerto Rico law is whether\n\nPlaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case of a design\n\ndefect    in    his        vehicle’s      airbags      in    light       of    Defendant’s\n\nadmissions that (1) the airbags should not have deployed at\n\nthe time of the accident, and (2) such deployment was the\n\ncause of Plaintiff’s injuries.                    The district court held that\n\nPlaintiff failed to establish a prima facie case and granted\n\nDefendant summary judgment.                    We exercise jurisdiction under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1291, and summarily affirm.\n\n    The     district          court’s     opinion          sets    forth      the    factual\n\ndetails    of    this        case   and    we     need     not     repeat      them    here.\n\nPunsoda-Díaz          v.    Ford    Motor      Co.,    Civil       No.    02-2444      (SEC)\n\n(JA),    Opinion       and    Order,      at    1-2    (D.P.R.,          filed      April    4,\n\n2006).    To summarize, Plaintiff Miguel Punsoda-Díaz’s 1993\n\nLincoln    Mercury          Towncar       struck       a    concrete       median      about\n\ntwelve inches high that separates traffic on a Puerto Rican\n\navenue.     The vehicle was traveling at a fairly low rate of\n\nspeed as Plaintiff was making a left turn onto the avenue.\n\nPlaintiff swerved to avoid a collision with another car and\n\nhit the median.              The vehicle’s airbags deployed, breaking\n\nPlaintiff’s arm in two places.\n\n    In     granting           Defendant         Ford       Motor    Company          summary\n\njudgment,       the    district      court      reasoned          that,       although      the\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fairbags     had   not   operated    as   intended   (a   point     which\n\nDefendant     concedes),    Plaintiff     failed    to   present     any\n\nevidence the vehicle’s airbag design was the proximate cause\n\nof his injuries:\n\n    Plaintiff has failed to identify the actual defect\n    in the [airbag] design.   Although . . . an injury\n    was suffered because of a defective product, in\n    this case plaintiff must prove that it was due to\n    a defect in the design of the product, and not\n    merely that the product suffered from a defect.\n    There is a difference between a defective product\n    that   has    been   manufactured    according   to\n    specifications, and is defective because the defect\n    is in the design of the product, and a defective\n    product that has been manufactured defectively.\n    . . .   [Under plaintiff’s design defect theory of\n    the case] it is important for plaintiff to first\n    establish that there is a specific feature in the\n    design of the product that supposedly caused him\n    damage. . . .       While it is clear that the\n    plaintiff was injured due to the deployment of the\n    airbags, there are no facts that suggest the\n    airbags suffered from a defect in their design. To\n    the contrary, Dr. Galdos [i.e., Plaintiff’s expert]\n    determined that the airbag system did not operate\n    as designed because it deployed at a Delta V [i.e.,\n    velocity] of less than four miles per hour although\n    it is designed to be deployed at a Delta V of\n    eight miles per hour or higher.    Ford agrees that\n    the air bag system was designed never to deploy\n    when the Delta V was less than eight miles per\n    hour. The mere allegation of the injury itself is\n    not sufficient to establish a defect in the design,\n    because if that were the case, whenever there is an\n    injury the burden would invariably shift [to the\n    manufacturer].    If plaintiff fails to introduce\n    evidence to prove the first element of his claim,\n    that is, the airbag system design proximately\n    caused his injury, then he is not able [under his\n    design defect theory of the case] to prove the\n    existence of the defect in the airbags and that\n    such defect caused him damages. . . . Whatever the\n    reason for the deployment of the airbags at a Delta\n    V of less than eight [miles per hour], there is no\n\n                                   -3-\n\f     evidence pointing to a defective             design   of   the\n     airbag system as the culprit.\n\nId. at 15-17 (internal citations and quotations omitted).\n\nOn appeal Plaintiff argues (as he did in the district court)\n\nthat to establish a prima facie case of a design defect he\n\nneed only submit enough evidence so that a reasonable juror\n\ncould find his vehicle’s airbags caused his injuries.\n\n     We have carefully reviewed the record and the parties’\n\nbriefs, and conclude the district court reached the correct\n\nresult under the applicable law.            Under Puerto Rico law,\n\nbefore Plaintiff may prevail on a claim of defective airbag\n\ndesign,   he    must   show   “‘the   product’s   design   proximately\n\ncaused his injury . . . .’”             Rivera Santana v. Superior\n\nPackaging, Inc., 132 D.P.R. 115, 129 (P.R. 1992) (emphasis\n\nadded) (quoting Barker v. Lull Eng’g Co., 573 P.2d 443, 456\n\n(Cal. 1978)). 1    Plaintiff has made no such showing.          We have\n\nrepeatedly opined that “‘when a lower court accurately takes\n\nthe measure of a case and articulates a cogent rationale, it\n\nserves no useful purpose for a reviewing court to write at\n\nlength.’”      Metropolitan Life Ins.
