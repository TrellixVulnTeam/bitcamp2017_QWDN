In the course of the oral argument,\nit appeared to us that the case may have arisen from a mutual\nmisunderstanding.    We encouraged the parties to engage in\ndiscussions and report back.\n\n     The parties reported back that they had resolved the matter.\nThe defendant requested dismissal and amicus filed a response which\nfavored dismissal and vacatur.       Defendant responded, at our\nrequest, to the position of amicus and did not oppose vacatur.\n\n     We have reviewed the parties' submissions. The defendants-\nappellees have provided the plaintiff the relief he requested in\nhis complaint.    As a general rule, \"'voluntary cessation of\nallegedly illegal conduct does not deprive the tribunal of power to\nhear and determine the case, i.e., does not make the case moot.'\nBut jurisdiction, properly acquired, may abate if the case becomes\n\fmoot because . . . it can be said with assurance that 'there is no\nreasonable expectation . . .' that the alleged violation will recur\n. . . .\" Los Angeles County v. Davis, 440 U.S. 625, 631 (1979)\n(quoting United States v. W.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632, 633\n(1953)) (citations omitted).       See Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v.\nRodriguez, 322 F.3d 747, 749 (1st Cir. 2003); Kerkhof v. MCI\nWorldcom, Inc., 282 F.3d 44, 53-54 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n     The parties agree that this condition is met and that the\nappeal should be dismissed as moot. The plaintiff-appellant has\nasked us, as a result, to vacate the judgment under review, which\nis reported in an opinion at Guzzi v. Thompson, 470 F. Supp. 2d 17\n(D. Mass. 2007). The decision on vacatur rests in the equitable\ndiscretion of this court. While mootness alone does not ordinarily\ngive rise to vacatur, we have recognized that vacatur \"may be\nappropriate where mootness arises . . . through the unilateral\naction of the party prevailing below.\" Wal-Mart, 322 F.3d at 749\n(1st Cir. 2003) (citing U.S. Bancorp Mortgage Co. v. Bonner Mall\nP'ship, 513 U.S. 18, 25 (1994)); see also Shelby v. Superformance\nInt'l., Inc., 435 F.3d 42, 46 (1st Cir. 2006); Kerkhof, 282 F.3d at\n54. The defendants-appellees here do not object to vacatur. We\nfind that the equitable considerations favor vacatur of the action.\nAs in Wal-Mart and Kerkhof, vacating the judgment preserves the\nability of both sides to litigate complex issues, here under the\nReligious Freedom Restoration Act. As well, federalism concerns\nsupport dismissal.\n\n     We accordingly vacate the district court's decision and remand\nwith instructions to dismiss this suit as moot. Each side shall\nbear its own costs.\n\n     So ordered.\n\n                                    By the Court:\n                                    /s/ Richard Cushing   Donovan,\n                                    Clerk\n\n\n\n\ncc: Hon.
