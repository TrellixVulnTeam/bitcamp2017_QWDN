Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                Selya and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Judith H. Mizner, on motion for issuance of certificate of\nappealability, for putative appellant.\n\n\n\n                        October 29, 2002\n\f             SELYA, Circuit Judge.        The petitioner, Manuel Gonzalez-\n\nGonzalez, moves for a certificate of appealability, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2253,   alleging   ineffective      assistance       of    appellate     and   trial\n\ncounsel.      We   recite    only   the      facts   necessary      to    limn   the\n\npetitioner's claims. We refer readers who hunger for more exegetic\n\ndetail to our opinion on direct appeal.                   See United States v.\n\nGonzalez-Gonzalez, 136 F.3d         6 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 524 U.S.\n\n910 (1998).\n\n             The petitioner's principal claim is that his appellate\n\ncounsel blundered by failing to argue that he (the petitioner) had\n\nbeen deprived of his Sixth Amendment right to represent himself.\n\nThe record, however, shows that the district court correctly denied\n\nthe   petitioner's     request   for     self-representation        because      the\n\npetitioner did not unequivocally waive his right to counsel.                     See\n\nUnited States v. Betancourt-Arretuche, 933 F.2d 89, 92 (1st Cir.\n\n1991) (honoring \"every reasonable presumption against waiver of the\n\nright to counsel\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nWith his counseled motion for hybrid representation still pending,\n\nthe petitioner submitted a pro se motion stating that he \"remains\n\nin    his   position   of    requesting      from    the    Court   his    pro   se\n\nrepresentation with the assistance of his attorney . . . as standby\n\ncounsel.\"     (emphasis     supplied).        The    unavoidable       conclusion,\n\nreinforced by the lengthy colloquy during the second day of trial,\n\nis that the petitioner was not asserting his right to represent\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fhimself,    but,    rather,    was   renewing    his       request   for   hybrid\n\nrepresentation. Accordingly, appellate counsel was not ineffective\n\nfor declining to raise the issue of self-representation.\n\n            We are somewhat more troubled by the claim that trial\n\nerror occurred during jury deliberations — error to which trial\n\ncounsel's lethargy allegedly contributed and about which appellate\n\ncounsel neglected to complain.         We set the stage.\n\n            The preferred practice in this circuit is that \"messages\n\nfrom a deliberating jury, pertaining to ongoing deliberations,\n\nought to be fully disclosed to the lawyers when received, so that\n\nthe latter may be heard before the judge implements a course of\n\naction.\" United States v. Parent, 954 F.2d 23, 25 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nAccording to the petitioner's unsworn memorandum,1 the district\n\ncourt, without notifying either counsel, granted the jury's request\n\nfor transcripts of the testimony of two government witnesses.                 The\n\ncourt then issued a written supplemental instruction in response to\n\na   jury   note    without    involving     counsel   in    the   process.     In\n\nsubstance, the instruction reminded the jury that it had a duty to\n\ndetermine the guilt or innocence of the defendant from the evidence\n\nin the case, and that the verdict must be unanimous as to each\n\ncount of the indictment.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The sworn petition alleges only that the court \"decid[ed]\njury notes out of presence of defendant.\"\n\n                                      -3-\n\f            In the ordinary course, a habeas application must rest on\n\na foundation of factual allegations presented under oath, either in\n\na verified petition or a supporting affidavit.          See, e.g., Rule 2,\n\nRules Governing Section 2255 Proceedings, 28 U.S.C. § 2255.          Facts\n\nalluded to in an unsworn memorandum are not sufficient.                See\n\nBarrett v. United States, 965 F.2d 1184, 1195 (1st Cir. 1992);\n\nDalli v. United States, 491 F.2d 758, 760 (2d Cir. 1974).           Here,\n\nmoreover,    even   were   we   to   accept   the   petitioner's   unsworn\n\nallegations as true, they would not warrant a certificate of\n\nappealability because the petitioner has identified no plausible\n\nway in which he might have been prejudiced.\n\n            The rule in this circuit is that \"a trial court's error\n\nin failing seasonably to inform counsel about a jury note does not\n\nrequire reversal if the error is benign.\"           Parent, 954 F.2d at 25\n\n(citing United States v. Maraj, 947 F.2d 520, 526 (1st Cir. 1991));\n\naccord United States v. Hernandez, 146 F.3d 30, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).2   This comports with the authorities elsewhere.         See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Bustamante, 805 F.2d 201, 203 (6th Cir. 1986);\n\nUnited States v. Widgery, 778 F.2d 325, 329 (7th Cir. 1985); United\n\n\n     2\n      We have yet to decide whether the appropriate test for\nharmlessness in this context is that set forth in Chapman v.\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967) (asking whether the error was\n\"harmless beyond a reasonable doubt\") or the more lenient inquiry\ndelineated in Kotteakos v. United States, 328 U.S. 750, 776 (1946)\n(asking whether \"the error had substantial and injurious effect or\ninfluence\" vis-à-vis the judgment). We need not make that choice\ntoday, as the petitioner falls short under either definition of\nharmless error.\n\n                                     -4-\n\fStates v. Arriagada, 451 F.2d 487, 488 (4th Cir. 1971); Jones v.\n\nUnited States, 299 F.2d 661, 662 (10th Cir. 1962).\n\n          In this instance, the supplemental instructions were\n\ncorrect on their face.        Moreover, even though the supplemental\n\ninstructions were \"delivered at a critical juncture in the case,\"\n\nthey were not \"out of balance\" in any material respect.                   Parent,\n\n954 F.2d at 26.     In any event, the supplemental instructions were\n\nsimilar to portions of the charge, given earlier, that counsel had\n\nreviewed without objections.       As for the transcripts, if they were\n\nfurnished to the jury at all — the court promised them only at the\n\nconclusion of its own review — it is hardly remarkable (and\n\ncertainly not erroneous) for the court to have key testimony read\n\nor submitted to the jury at the jury's request.            See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Argentine, 814 F.3d 783, 787 (1st Cir. 1987).                      The\n\npetitioner gives us no convincing reason to think that counsel\n\nmight have objected; or that, if he had objected, he could have\n\nchanged the trial court's mind; or even that, had the transcripts\n\nbeen withheld, the verdict might have been different.\n\n          In   an   effort    to   parry   this    thrust,    the   petitioner\n\ncontends that, notwithstanding the Parent rule, prejudice should be\n\npresumed because he was \"denied counsel at a critical stage of his\n\ntrial.\"   United     States   v.   Cronic,   466    U.S.     648,   659   (1984)\n\n(footnote omitted).    Doctrinally speaking, however, prejudice per\n\nse is hen's-teeth rare.       Indeed, two recent Supreme Court cases\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fhave emphasized just how unusual are the circumstances that would\n\njustify a court in forgoing particularized inquiry into whether\n\ncounsel's inadequate performance undermined the reliability of a\n\nverdict. See Mickens v. Taylor, 122 S. Ct. 1237, 1241 (2002); Bell\n\nv. Cone, 122 S. Ct. 1843, 1850-51 (2002).         In both instances, the\n\nCourt    reiterated   the   proposition   that,    in   the   ineffective\n\nassistance context, prejudice may be presumed only in narrowly\n\ncircumscribed situations.3    We too have emphasized the same point.\n\nSee, e.g., Ouber v. Guarino, 293 F.3d 19, 33 (1st Cir. 2002);\n\nScarpa v. Dubois, 38 F.3d 1, 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1994).              We are\n\nconstrained by these authorities to hold that the prejudice per se\n\ndoctrine does not apply in the circumstances of this case.4\n\n           The petitioner next asserts that his various counsel\n\nshould have anticipated the Supreme Court's decision in Apprendi v.\n\nNew Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), and that he should be resentenced\n\n\n     3\n      Moreover, the Supreme Court recently vacated the decision in\nFrench v. Jones, 282 F.3d 893, 901 (6th Cir. 2002) (affirming the\ngrant of a state prisoner's habeas petition on the ground that the\nstate courts \"unreasonably applied harmless error analysis to\nFrench's   deprivation   of   counsel   during  the   supplemental\ninstruction\").     The Court remanded the case \"for further\nconsideration in light of Bell v. Cone[.]\" Jones v. French, 122 S.\nCt. 2324 (2002) (per curiam).\n     4\n      Our opinion in Curtis v. Duval, 124 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 1997),\nis not to the contrary. Dictum aside, the Curtis court, consistent\nwith Bell and Mickens, rejected the habeas petitioner's reliance on\n\"Cronic's prejudice per se principle\" and held that the petitioner\nwas not \"actually prejudiced.\" Id. at 6. We explained that the\ntrial court's error in instructing the jury during the \"transitory\nabsence\" of the petitioner's counsel \"was neither substantial nor\ninjurious,\" but, rather, \"harmless.\" Id.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fin    light   of   that    decision.    Even   assuming      Apprendi   applies\n\nretroactively to this case — a matter on which we take no view —\n\nany error would be harmless.       See United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d\n\n56, 61-62 (1st Cir. 2001) (applying harmless error analysis to\n\nassertion of Apprendi error).\n\n              Here, the evidence overwhelmingly establishes the minimum\n\ndrug quantity needed to justify the sentence actually imposed. The\n\ngovernment's \"very strong case against Gonzalez\" included the\n\nphysical seizure of 350 kilograms of cocaine, part of a \"major\n\nshipment of cocaine and marijuana Gonzalez had imported from\n\nColombia to Puerto Rico in September of 1992.\"            Gonzalez-Gonzalez,\n\n136 F.3d at 8, 10.         No more is exigible to defeat an unpreserved\n\nApprendi claim.\n\n              The petitioner also asseverates that his trial counsel\n\nshould have investigated and called three witnesses on his behalf.\n\nThis asseveration is unpersuasive. There is no indication that one\n\nwitness, a convicted codefendant in a related case, made available\n\nany    allegedly    exculpatory    information      before    or   during    the\n\npetitioner's trial.         The second witness would have offered only\n\ncumulative impeachment testimony.            The third might in turn have\n\nbeen impeached with his prior statements implicating the petitioner\n\nin several drug transactions.            Under these circumstances, the\n\npetitioner cannot overcome the presumption that counsel's decision\n\nnot to    call     these   witnesses   might   be   considered     sound    trial\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fstrategy.    See, e.g., Lema v. United States, 987 F.2d 48, 55 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (stating that the \"decision to interview potential\n\nwitnesses, like the decision to present their testimony, must be\n\nevaluated in light of whatever trial strategy reasonably competent\n\ncounsel devised in the context of the particular case\"); United\n\nStates ex rel. Walker v. Henderson, 492 F.2d 1311, 1314 (2d Cir.\n\n1974) (stating that \"the decision to call or bypass particular\n\nwitnesses is peculiarly a question of trial strategy which courts\n\nwill practically never second-guess\") (citation omitted).\n\n            Finally, the petitioner faults his appellate counsel for\n\nnot bringing the government to account for sharp tactics.      In this\n\nregard, he contends that the government improperly \"highlighted\"\n\nalleged code words in video transcripts that were shown to the\n\njury, using quotation marks and contrasting typeface for emphasis.\n\nAt trial, the petitioner objected to the government's playback of\n\ntape recordings on several grounds, including improper redaction,\n\nmanipulation of volume, and apparent errors of transcription.\n\nHighlighting was not one of his complaints.          We find the new\n\nallegation inherently improbable and contradicted by the record.\n\nThus, we cannot say that appellate counsel was ineffective for\n\nfailing to raise this claim.\n\n            We need go no further.     The motion for a certificate of\n\nappealability is denied and the appeal is terminated.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

As for the transcripts, if they were\n\nfurnished to the jury at all — the court promised them only at the\n\nconclusion of its own review — it is hardly remarkable (and\n\ncertainly not erroneous) for the court to have key testimony read\n\nor submitted to the jury at the jury's request.

Doctrinally speaking, however, prejudice per\n\nse is hen's-teeth rare.

Even   assuming      Apprendi   applies\n\nretroactively to this case — a matter on which we take no view —\n\nany error would be harmless.       See United States v.

The\n\ngovernment's \"very strong case against Gonzalez\" included the\n\nphysical seizure of 350 kilograms of cocaine, part of a \"major\n\nshipment of cocaine and marijuana Gonzalez had imported from\n\nColombia to Puerto Rico in September of 1992.\"            Gonzalez-Gonzalez,\n\n136 F.3d at 8, 10.         No more is exigible to defeat an unpreserved\n\nApprendi claim.\n\n              The petitioner also asseverates that his trial counsel\n\nshould have investigated and called three witnesses on his behalf.\n\nThis asseveration is unpersuasive. There is no indication that one\n\nwitness, a convicted codefendant in a related case, made available\n\nany    allegedly    exculpatory    information      before    or   during    the\n\npetitioner's trial.         The second witness would have offered only\n\ncumulative impeachment testimony.            The third might in turn have\n\nbeen impeached with his prior statements implicating the petitioner\n\nin several drug transactions.            Under these circumstances, the\n\npetitioner cannot overcome the presumption that counsel's decision\n\nnot to    call     these   witnesses   might   be   considered     sound    trial\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fstrategy.
