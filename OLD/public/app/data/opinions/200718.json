Delgado Hernandez on brief for appellee State\nElections Commission.\n\n\n\n                        October 31, 2003\n\f            Per Curiam.   This is a challenge to a Puerto Rican law,\n\n21 P.R. Laws Ann. § 4101(f), that permanently disqualifies as a\n\ncandidate for mayor any person who has been removed from public\n\noffice for misconduct.1 Plaintiff Cesar Torres-Torres, a member of\n\nthe New Progressive Party (NPP), seeks to run for mayor of the\n\nmunicipality of Juncos.     Pursuant to § 4101(f), however, he has\n\nbeen barred from doing so because of his removal from that post in\n\n1987.     Objecting to such \"decertification,\" plaintiff filed the\n\ninstant action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 alleging that the statute\n\ncontravened the First and Fourteenth Amendments.               The district\n\ncourt rejected    those   claims   on    the   merits   and   plaintiff   has\n\nappealed.\n\n            Severe time constraints are present: plaintiff filed the\n\nappeal on October 17, 2003 and, rather than seeking a stay, has\n\nrequested that a decision be issued before November 9, 2003, the\n\ndate of the NPP primary.      By agreement, the parties have filed\n\nbriefs on an expedited basis and have waived oral argument. Having\n\nfully reviewed the record and the parties' submissions, we now\n\naffirm.\n\n                              Background\n\n            This action is a reprise of one filed by plaintiff in\n\n1988.     After being disqualified from that year's mayoral race\n\n\n     1\n        Section 4101(f) requires that a mayoral aspirant \"[h]ave\nnever been removed from office or employment for misconduct in the\nperformance of his/her duties.\"\n\n                                   -2-\n\fpursuant    to    a    (similarly     worded)   predecessor   to   §    4101(f),\n\nplaintiff mounted a constitutional challenge. The ensuing district\n\ncourt opinion, Torres v. Comision Estatal de Elecciones, 700 F.\n\nSupp. 613 (D.P.R. 1988), recounts much of the pertinent procedural\n\nbackground.       We rely thereon and for present purposes deem it\n\nsufficient to note the following.\n\n            Plaintiff was elected mayor of Juncos in 1976 and was\n\nreelected in 1980 and 1984.           In 1986, the governor, a member of the\n\nPopular Democratic Party (PDP), summarily suspended him from office\n\nand filed a complaint with the Municipal Complaints Commission, an\n\nagency authorized to adjudicate allegations of mayoral misconduct.\n\nSee   21   P.R.   Laws     Ann.   §    4108   (current   version   of    removal\n\nprovision).       The charges against plaintiff included misuse of\n\npublic funds, inexcusable negligence, and conduct detrimental to\n\nthe public interest.        In June 1987, following 18 days of hearings\n\nat which plaintiff was represented by counsel, the Complaints\n\nCommission issued a resolution upholding all charges and ordering\n\nhis removal.2         Plaintiff's attempt to obtain judicial review of\n\nthis ruling was ultimately rejected as untimely.              See Hernandez-\n\n\n\n      2\n         As described in its decision, the Commission found\n\"repeated acts\" of \"appropriation of public funds for the purpose\nof paying election-related debts through the preparation of false\ndocuments\" and \"cases in which public officials appropriated\nmunicipal funds and divided them with other persons for their own\nuse.\" Decis. at 29-30. The district court in Torres could not\n\"emphasize enough the gravity of these offenses.\" 700 F. Supp. at\n624.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fColon v. Torres, 21 P.R. Offic. Trans. 516 (1988).                    As a result,\n\n\"the Complaints      Commission's         factual    findings   and    conclusions\n\n[became] final and not subject to review.\"              Torres, 700 F. Supp. at\n\n616.   Plaintiff has never been indicted, tried, or convicted for\n\nany of the charges against him.\n\n          As mentioned, plaintiff was disqualified from the 1988\n\nmayoral election because of the predecessor to § 4101(f).                     In the\n\nensuing litigation, the Torres court rejected his challenges to\n\nthat provision, even while voicing reservations about extending the\n\ndisqualification \"beyond the election immediately following the\n\nterm in which a person is dismissed.\"               Id. at 625.      After sitting\n\nout two electoral cycles, plaintiff sought to be certified as an\n\nindependent candidate for the 2000 election. He was again declared\n\nineligible     and   was    again    denied     judicial    relief      (from    the\n\nCommonwealth courts).       He ended up running as a write-in candidate\n\nand came in second to the PDP candidate by a margin of 7,453 to\n\n6,574 votes.\n\n          Plaintiff        filed    the    instant    action    in    April     2003,\n\nalleging that he wanted to run as the NPP's mayoral candidate in\n\nthe 2004 election but was barred from doing so by § 4101(f).                     The\n\nmagistrate judge concluded that plaintiff was likely to prevail on\n\nthe merits and recommended that a preliminary injunction issue.\n\nThe district court took a different view, first denying the request\n\nfor a preliminary injunction and later rejecting plaintiff's claims\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fon the merits.     Meanwhile, the Elections Commission in September\n\n2003 again decertified plaintiff as a candidate.\n\n                              Discussion\n\n            Ballot-access   cases   typically    involve      both   a   First\n\nAmendment claim (involving the associational and voting rights of\n\ncandidates and their supporters) and an equal protection claim\n\n(challenging   a   classification    between    groups   of    candidates).\n\nAlthough the two claims often overlap, it is sometimes appropriate\n\nto analyze them separately under different standards of review.\n\nPlaintiff in his complaint relied solely on equal protection.              Yet\n\nhis subsequent pleadings included a First Amendment claim, and\n\ndefendants addressed both allegations on the merits without any\n\nsuggestion of waiver, as did the magistrate judge.             We therefore\n\nconclude that both claims have been adequately presented.                 See,\n\ne.g., Mancuso v. Taft, 476 F.2d 187, 190 (1st Cir. 1973) (noting\n\nthat candidate has standing to \"raise the constitutional rights of\n\nvoters\").\n\n            First Amendment Claim\n\n            As the parties agree, this claim is subject to the\n\nbalancing test promulgated in Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780,\n\n789 (1983).3   The Court has more recently summarized that test as\n\nfollows:\n\n\n     3\n           While the district court did not expressly apply the\nAnderson    test, much of its reasoning is directly applicable\nthereto.\n\n                                    -5-\n\f               When deciding whether a state election\n          law violates First and Fourteenth Amendment\n          associational rights, we weigh the character\n          and magnitude of the burden the State's rule\n          imposes on those rights against the interests\n          the State contends justify that burden, and\n          consider the extent to which the State's\n          concerns    make   the    burden    necessary.\n          Regulations   imposing   severe   burdens   on\n          plaintiffs' rights must be narrowly tailored\n          and advance a compelling state interest.\n          Lesser burdens, however, trigger less exacting\n          review, and a State's important regulatory\n          interests will usually be enough to justify\n          reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions.\n\nTimmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U.S. 351, 358 (1997)\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted).        Under this\n\nstandard, \"[t]he rigorousness of the ensuing judicial inquiry\n\ndepends upon the extent to which the challenged regulation burdens\n\nFirst Amendment rights.\"     Perez-Guzman v. Gracia, ___ F.3d ___,\n\n2003 WL 22309626, at *9 (1st Cir. 2003).   We think it clear that §\n\n4101(f) as applied to plaintiff is sustainable under this test, for\n\nreasons that can be briefly explained.\n\n          First, the burden on plaintiff's and voters' rights under\n\nthe First Amendment is not severe, which means that strict scrutiny\n\nis inapplicable.     Candidacy does not rise to the level of a\n\nfundamental right.   See, e.g., Clements v. Fashing, 457 U.S. 957,\n\n963 (1982) (plurality).      And § 4101(f) applies even-handedly,\n\nwithout discriminating on the basis of viewpoint or any other\n\nsuspect classification.    It is true that plaintiff's supporters--a\n\nsizable group judging from the 2000 returns--will be deprived of\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\ftheir candidate of choice.         But as the Court stated in Timmons:\n\n\"[t]hat a particular individual may not appear on the ballot as a\n\nparticular party's candidate does not severely burden that party's\n\nassociational rights.\"          520 U.S. at 359.       Because plaintiff's\n\nsupporters retain the option of voting for another NPP candidate\n\nwith   a   similar   viewpoint,    their     voting   rights   will    be   only\n\nmarginally affected.\n\n            Second, it is undisputed that the Commonwealth has a\n\nlegitimate and powerful interest in eradicating public corruption.\n\nSee, e.g., Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Gov. PAC, 528 U.S. 377, 389\n\n(2000) (\"The importance of the governmental interest in preventing\n\n[corruption] has never been doubted.\") (quoting First Nat'l Bank of\n\nBoston v. Bellotti, 435 U.S. 765, 788 n.26 (1978) (brackets in\n\noriginal)).\n\n            Under the final Anderson criterion, as mentioned, a\n\nregulation need not be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling\n\nstate interest where, as here, the impact on First Amendment rights\n\nis not severe.       Instead, \"less exacting review\" is called for.\n\nTimmons, 520 U.S. at 358.        Plaintiff, relying on the reservations\n\nvoiced in dictum by the Torres court, see 700 F. Supp. at 625,\n\nnonetheless contends that a lifetime disqualification cannot be\n\njustified.     In particular, he relies on (1) the prospect of §\n\n4101(f)    being     employed     to    discriminate    against       political\n\nadversaries, (2) the statute's failure to allow for possible\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\frehabilitation, and (3) the long-term effects on voters' rights.\n\nWe are unpersuaded.\n\n          As    to     the    first    point,    there    is    no    evidence       that\n\nplaintiff's removal as mayor was politically motivated, and the\n\nTorres court specifically found that the statute \"ha[d] not been\n\ndiscriminatorily applied to the plaintiff.\"                     Id. at 622.4        This\n\nbeing an as-applied challenge, plaintiff's concern about possible\n\ndiscrimination against others is misplaced.                        His second point\n\noverlooks the fact that § 4101(f) not only \"punishes corruption but\n\nalso deters it.\"        Id. at 624.         And it fails to account for more\n\nrecent case law rejecting constitutional challenges to lifetime\n\ndisqualifications       of    various       sorts.     See,     e.g.,       Gregory    v.\n\nAshcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 470-73 (1991) (mandatory retirement age for\n\nelected judges); Citizens for Legis. Choice v. Miller, 144 F.3d\n\n916, 920-24     (6th    Cir.       1998)   (lifetime     term      limits    for    state\n\nlegislators).    Plaintiff's final point proves unavailing given §\n\n4101(f)'s minimal impact on the rights of voters, as earlier\n\ndiscussed.\n\n          We conclude that § 4101(f) constitutes a \"reasonable,\n\nnondiscriminatory restriction\" which, under the Anderson test, is\n\nsustainable     under        the    First     Amendment       in     light     of     the\n\nCommonwealth's       \"important       regulatory       interest\"       in    combating\n\n\n     4\n         Plaintiff has not here claimed to be innocent of the\nmisconduct charges. And he forfeited his chance to challenge his\nremoval by not timely seeking court review.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fcorruption at the municipal level.             Timmons, 520 U.S. at 358\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n              Equal Protection Claim\n\n              This allegation requires little discussion. As the claim\n\nhas been narrowed on appeal, plaintiff complains of the disparate\n\ntreatment afforded by § 4101(f) as compared to 3 P.R. Laws Ann. §\n\n1491.       The latter, a general provision applicable to all public\n\nservants, prohibits inter alia any person convicted of certain\n\nmisdemeanors from seeking or holding any elective office or public\n\nservice position for eight years.5             Such a classification is\n\nsubject to rational-basis review, see, e.g., Clements, 457 U.S. at\n\n963 (plurality), and is readily sustainable thereunder.\n\n              It suffices to note the following. The legislature could\n\nrationally conclude that mayoral aspirants should be subjected to\n\nmore       stringent   sanctions   than    other   government     employees--\n\nparticularly given the importance of the mayor's office in Puerto\n\nRico.       See, e.g., Torres, 700 F. Supp. at 623-24.          Likewise, the\n\nlegislature need not treat all current or former officeholders\n\nequally, but instead may regulate \"one step at a time, addressing\n\nitself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute.\"\n\nClements, 457 U.S. at 969 (plurality) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); accord id. at 973-74 (Stevens, J., concurring).\n\n\n\n       5\n        We deem plaintiff's earlier argument concerning § 1491's\neffect on convicted felons to have been abandoned.\n\n                                     -9-\n\f                              Conclusion\n\n          For these reasons, we conclude that § 4101(f) as applied\n\nto plaintiff violates neither the First Amendment nor the Equal\n\nProtection Clause.    Accord Popular Democratic Party v. Planadeball\n\nPoggy, 21 P.R. Offic.

Candidacy does not rise to the level of a fundamental right. <i>See, e.g., Clements v. Fashing,</i> 457 U.S. 957, 963, 102 S.Ct. 2836, 73 L.Ed.2d 508 (1982) (plurality). And &#167; 4101(f) applies evenhandedly, without discriminating on the basis of viewpoint or any other suspect classification. It is true that plaintiff's supporters &#8212; a sizable group judging from the 2000 returns &#8212; will be deprived of their candidate of choice. But as the Court stated in <i>Timmons:</i> \"[t]hat a particular individual may not appear on the ballot as a particular party's candidate does not severely burden that party's associational rights.\" 520 U.S. at 359, 117 S.Ct. 1364, 137 L.Ed.2d 589. Because plaintiff's supporters retain the option of voting for another NPP candidate with a similar viewpoint, their voting rights will be only marginally affected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, it is undisputed that the Commonwealth has a legitimate and powerful interest in eradicating public corruption. <i>See, e.g., Nixon v. Shrink Missouri Gov. PAC,</i> 528 U.S. 377, 389, 120 S.Ct. 897, 145 L.Ed.2d 886 (2000) (\"The importance of the governmental interest in preventing [corruption] has never been doubted.\") (quoting <i>First Nat'l Bank of Boston v. Bellotti,</i> 435 U.S. 765, 788 n. 26, 98 S.Ct. 1407, 55 L.Ed.2d 707 (1978) (brackets in original)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the final <i>Anderson</i> criterion, as mentioned, a regulation need not be narrowly tailored to advance a compelling state interest where, as here, the impact on First Amendment rights is not severe. Instead, \"less exacting review\" is called for. <i>Timmons,</i> 520 U.S. at 358, 117 S.Ct. 1364. Plaintiff, relying on the reservations voiced in dictum by the <i>Torres</i> court, <i>see</i> 700 F.Supp. at 625, nonetheless contends that a lifetime disqualification cannot be justified. In particular, he relies on (1) the prospect of &#167; 4101(f) being employed to discriminate against political adversaries, (2) the statute's failure to allow for possible rehabilitation, and (3) the long-term effects on voters' rights. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first point, there is no evidence that plaintiff's removal as mayor was politically motivated, and the <i>Torres</i> court specifically found that the statute \"ha[d] not been discriminatorily applied to the plaintiff.\" <i>Id.</i> at 622.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> This being an as-applied challenge, plaintiff's concern about possible discrimination against others is misplaced. His second point overlooks the fact that &#167; 4101(f) not only \"punishes corruption but also deters it.\" <i>Id.</i> at 624. And it fails to account for more recent case law rejecting constitutional challenges to lifetime disqualifications of various sorts. <i>See, e.g., Gregory v. Ashcroft,</i> 501 U.S. 452, 470-73, 111 S.Ct. 2395, 115 L.Ed.2d 410 (1991) (mandatory retirement age for elected judges); <i>Citizens for Legis. Choice v. Miller,</i> 144 F.3d 916, 920-24 (6th Cir. 1998) (lifetime term limits for state legislators). Plaintiff's final point proves unavailing given &#167; 4101(f)'s minimal impact on the rights of voters, as earlier discussed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that &#167; 4101(f) constitutes a \"reasonable, nondiscriminatory restriction\" which, under the <i>Anderson</i> test, is sustainable under the First Amendment in light of the Commonwealth's \"important regulatory interest\" in combating corruption at the municipal level. <i>Timmons,</i> 520 U.S. at 358, 117 S.Ct. 1364 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Equal Protection Claim</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This allegation requires little discussion. As the claim has been narrowed on appeal, plaintiff complains of the disparate treatment afforded by &#167; 4101(f) as compared to 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1491. The latter, a general provision applicable to all public servants, prohibits <i>inter alia</i> any person convicted of certain misdemeanors from seeking or holding any elective office or public service position for eight years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Such a classification is subject to rational-basis review, <i>see, e.g., Clements,</i> 457 U.S. at 963, 102 S.Ct. 2836 (plurality), and is readily sustainable thereunder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It suffices to note the following.

Likewise, the legislature need not treat all current or former officeholders equally, but instead may regulate \"one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute.\" <i>Clements,</i> 457 U.S. at 969, 102 S.Ct. 2836 (plurality) (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>accord id.</i> at 973-74 (Stevens, J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Conclusion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we conclude that &#167; 4101(f) as applied to plaintiff violates neither the First Amendment nor the Equal Protection Clause. <i>Accord Popular Democratic Party v.

Pursuant to &#167; 4101(f), however, he has been barred from doing so because of his removal from that post in 1987. Objecting to such \"decertification,\" plaintiff filed the instant action under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 alleging that the statute contravened the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The district court rejected those claims on the merits and plaintiff has appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Severe time constraints are present: plaintiff filed the appeal on October 17, 2003 and, rather than seeking a stay, has requested that a decision be issued before November 9, 2003, the date of the NPP primary.

After being disqualified from that year's mayoral race pursuant to a (similarly worded) predecessor to &#167; 4101(f), plaintiff mounted a constitutional challenge. The ensuing district court opinion, <i>Torres v. Comision Estatal de Elecciones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1453015\"><a href=\"/opinion/1453015/torres-v-comision-estatal-de-elecciones-de-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">700</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">613</span></a></span> (D.P.R.1988), recounts much of the pertinent procedural background. We rely thereon and for present purposes deem it sufficient to note the following.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff was elected mayor of Juncos in 1976 and was reelected in 1980 and 1984. In 1986, the governor, a member of the Popular Democratic Party (PDP), summarily suspended him from office and filed a complaint with the Municipal Complaints Commission, an agency authorized to adjudicate allegations of mayoral misconduct. <i>See</i> 21 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 4108 (current version of removal provision). The charges against plaintiff included misuse of public funds, inexcusable negligence, and conduct detrimental to the public interest. In June 1987, following 18 days of hearings at which plaintiff was represented by counsel, the Complaints Commission issued a resolution upholding all charges and ordering his removal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Plaintiff's attempt to obtain judicial review of this ruling was ultimately rejected as untimely. <i>See Hernandez-Colon v. Torres,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">21</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">516</span></span> (1988). As a result, \"the Complaints Commission's factual findings and conclusions [became] final and not subject to review.\" <i>Torres,</i> 700 F.Supp. at 616. Plaintiff has never been indicted, tried, or convicted for any of the charges against him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As mentioned, plaintiff was disqualified from the 1988 mayoral election because of the predecessor to &#167; 4101(f). In the ensuing litigation, the <i>Torres</i> court rejected his challenges to that provision, even while voicing reservations about extending the disqualification \"beyond the election immediately following the term in which a person is dismissed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 625. After sitting out two electoral cycles, plaintiff sought to be certified as an independent candidate for the 2000 election. He was again declared ineligible and was again denied judicial relief (from the Commonwealth courts). He ended up running as a write-in candidate and came in second to the PDP candidate by a margin of 7,453 to 6,574 votes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff filed the instant action in April 2003, alleging that he wanted to run as the NPP's mayoral candidate in the 2004 election but was barred from doing so by &#167; 4101(f). The magistrate judge concluded that plaintiff was likely to prevail on the merits and recommended that a preliminary injunction issue. The district court took a different view, first denying the request for a preliminary injunction and later rejecting plaintiff's claims on the merits. Meanwhile, the Elections Commission in September 2003 again decertified plaintiff as a candidate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>Discussion</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ballot-access cases typically involve both a First Amendment claim (involving the associational and voting rights of candidates and their supporters) and an equal protection claim (challenging a classification between groups of candidates).

Instead, \"less exacting review\" is called for. <i>Timmons,</i> 520 U.S. at 358, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118102\"><a href=\"/opinion/118102/timmons-v-twin-cities-area-new-party/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1364</span></a></span>. Plaintiff, relying on the reservations voiced in dictum by the <i>Torres</i> court, <i>see</i> 700 F.Supp. at 625, nonetheless contends that a lifetime disqualification cannot be justified. In particular, he relies on (1) the prospect of &#167; 4101(f) being employed to discriminate against political adversaries, (2) the statute's failure to allow for possible rehabilitation, and (3) the long-term effects on voters' rights. We are unpersuaded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the first point, there is no evidence that plaintiff's removal as mayor was politically motivated, and the <i>Torres</i> court specifically found that the statute \"ha[d] not been discriminatorily applied to the plaintiff.\" <i>Id.</i> at 622.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> This being an as-applied challenge, plaintiff's concern about possible discrimination against others is misplaced. His second point overlooks the fact that &#167; 4101(f) not only \"punishes corruption but also deters it.\" <i>Id.</i> at 624. And it fails to account for more recent case law rejecting constitutional challenges to lifetime disqualifications of various sorts. <i>See, e.g., Gregory v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112632\"><a href=\"/opinion/112632/gregory-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">501</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 470-73, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112632\"><a href=\"/opinion/112632/gregory-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Plaintiff's final point proves unavailing given &#167; 4101(f)'s minimal impact on the rights of voters, as earlier discussed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that &#167; 4101(f) constitutes a \"reasonable, nondiscriminatory restriction\" which, under the <i>Anderson</i> test, is sustainable under the First Amendment in light of the Commonwealth's \"important regulatory interest\" in combating corruption at the municipal level. <i>Timmons,</i> 520 U.S. at 358, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118102\"><a href=\"/opinion/118102/timmons-v-twin-cities-area-new-party/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As the claim has been narrowed on appeal, plaintiff complains of the disparate treatment afforded by &#167; 4101(f) as compared to 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1491. The latter, a general provision applicable to all public servants, prohibits <i>inter alia</i> any person convicted of certain misdemeanors from seeking or holding any elective office or public service position for eight years.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Such a classification is subject to rational-basis review, <i>see, e.g., Clements,</i> 457 U.S. at 963, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110767\"><a href=\"/opinion/110767/clements-v-fashing/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The legislature could rationally conclude that mayoral aspirants should be subjected to more stringent sanctions than other government employees &#8212; particularly given the importance of the mayor's office in Puerto Rico. <i>See, e.g., Torres,</i> 700 F.Supp. at 623-24. Likewise, the legislature need not treat all current or former officeholders equally, but instead may regulate \"one step at a time, addressing itself to the phase of the problem which seems most acute.\" <i>Clements,</i> 457 U.S. at 969, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110767\"><a href=\"/opinion/110767/clements-v-fashing/\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
