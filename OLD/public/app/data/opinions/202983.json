R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Acting Attorney General\nPeter D. Keisler is substituted for former Attorney General\nAlberto R. Gonzáles as respondent.\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.          On October 4, 2006, the Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") adopted and affirmed the decision of\n\nan Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") rejecting Petitioner Valter Prela's\n\nclaims for asylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the\n\nConvention Against Torture (\"CAT\").                 The IJ found significant\n\ninconsistencies in Prela's story, but Prela did not address those\n\ninconsistencies before the BIA.               Prela now appeals the BIA's\n\ndecision,   arguing   that    the   IJ's       credibility    finding    is   not\n\nsupported by the record, and that the IJ failed to consider whether\n\nPrela is eligible for CAT relief.            After careful consideration, we\n\ndeny the petition for review.\n\n                              I. Background\n\n            Prela is a native and citizen of Albania. His claims for\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and CAT relief stem from his and\n\nhis   family's   support     of   the    Democratic      Party    in    Albania.\n\nParticularly, Prela alleges that his family has suffered \"severe\n\nand   longstanding    persecution       at    the    hands   of   the   Albanian\n\nauthorities.\"    His family was banished from their village after\n\nPrela's father spoke out against the Communist Party then in power.\n\nHis father, a leader in the Democratic Party, was eventually killed\n\nin 1993.\n\n            Prela also claims that his younger brother, Arjan, was\n\nlater murdered by Socialists after he attempted to make a report to\n\na Democratic Party newspaper denouncing the corruption of the\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fSocialist government.      Authorities, however, apparently ruled the\n\ndeath an accident. Shortly after Arjan's death, the family changed\n\ntheir \"well-known, especially, among the Socialist Party, last\n\nname\"1 to \"Prela.\"\n\n           The deaths of his father and brother only spurred Prela's\n\nsupport   of   the   Democratic   Party,    despite   a   forty-eight   hour\n\ndetention in September 1998, and another \"stop\" by the Socialists\n\non the street.       Prela then became a member of the election staff\n\nfor the June 24, 2001 election.           His duties included organizing\n\nmeetings for the Democratic Party candidates and speaking about the\n\nbenefits of democratic government.         During the election campaign,\n\nPrela claims that he was threatened, stopped, and assessed fines.\n\n           The most serious incident Prela describes occurred on the\n\nday of the election.      Prela explains that he witnessed Socialists\n\n\"caus[ing] chaos\" at his assigned polling station. When he reported\n\nthe improper activities to the station chairman, a Socialist, he\n\nwas asked to leave the station.      He refused and was dragged away.\n\nOn his way home, he was severely beaten by \"three masked men [who]\n\ncame from [a] police van.\" When he attempted to report the beating\n\nto the police, he was threatened for filing a \"false accusation.\"\n\n           On June 30, 2001, Prela participated in a demonstration\n\nagainst the Socialist Party's corruption related to the election.\n\n\n\n1\n   It is unclear from the record and the parties' briefs exactly\nwhat Prela's original last name was.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fHe was hit by police with a rubber stick, taking several days to\n\nrecover.\n\n            In July 2001, Prela was summoned to court regarding his\n\naccusation against the police, but he decided not to appear.                   He\n\nreceived another summons in September 2001.             Shortly thereafter,\n\nfearing for his safety, he decided to leave Albania.\n\n            Prela did not seek asylum upon his entry into the United\n\nStates.    Rather, he waited until he was issued a Notice to Appear\n\non May 23, 2002, charging him with being removable.\n\n            The IJ found significant inconsistencies in the evidence\n\npresented   in   support     of   Prela's    story.     For   example,      Prela\n\ntestified that his father was killed by a group of Socialists and\n\nex-communists while giving a speech in Likmetaj, and Prela's mother\n\nstated in an affidavit that his father was killed during a meeting\n\nof the Democratic Party.          The Democratic Party, however, wrote a\n\nletter stating that Prela's father was killed in the town of Ishem\n\nby a group of criminals.      In addition, Prela stated that he changed\n\nhis last name to \"Prela\" on October 12, 2000, but his Democratic\n\nParty   membership   card,    issued    in   March    1996,   bears   the    name\n\n\"Prela.\"    The IJ also noted that he was unclear as to how changing\n\nhis name would make Prela safer, given that he worked in a store\n\nbearing the family's real last name.           Similarly, Prela testified\n\nthat he went into hiding after the summonses were issued, though he\n\nwas \"hiding\" in his own home and still working at the store.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f            The most notable inconsistency, according to the IJ, was\n\nPrela's testimony regarding his June 24, 2001 arrest and beating.\n\nPrela testified before the judge that he spent two days in the\n\nhospital after his beating.          In his affidavit, however, Prela had\n\nstated that he was sent home after just a few hours.                     Moreover,\n\nPrela had given three different times -- 4:30 p.m., 7:30 p.m., and\n\n11:00 p.m. -- for when the incident with the police allegedly\n\noccurred.\n\n            Based in part on these inconsistencies, the IJ found that\n\nPrela had not borne the burden of proof that he was the victim of\n\npast   persecution,    that    he    had   a   well-founded      fear    of    future\n\npersecution, or that it was more likely than not that he would be\n\npersecuted or tortured if returned to Albania.                As a result, the IJ\n\ndenied Prela's claims and ordered him removed.\n\n            The BIA upheld the IJ's denial of relief to the extent\n\nthat it was based upon an adverse credibility finding.2                       The BIA\n\nstated   that   it   found    no    reason     to   disturb   the   IJ's      adverse\n\ncredibility determination, noting that on appeal Prela had not\n\naddressed   the   \"significant       inconsistencies      between       the    asylum\n\napplication, testimony and documentary evidence on matters which go\n\nto the heart of the claim.\"\n\n\n\n2\n   The IJ had also found that \"[e]ven viewing [Prela's] testimony\nin the best possible light to him, . . . what he has actually shown\nis that while participating in demonstrations which ended up\nviolently, that he was abused by police.\"\n\n                                       -5-\n\f                               II. Discussion\n\n           While we normally review the BIA's decision as the final\n\nagency order, we look to the IJ's decision to the extent it was\n\nadopted and affirmed by the BIA.         Simo v. Gonzáles, 445 F.3d 7, 11\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).       We review the IJ's findings, including his\n\ncredibility determination, to determine whether they are \"supported\n\nby reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.\"       Bocova v. Gonzáles, 412 F.3d 257, 262 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (quoting INS v. Elías-Zacarías, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992)).     We will not reverse unless \"any reasonable adjudicator\n\nwould be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252\n\n(b)(4)(B).\n\n           First, Prela argues that the BIA erred in affirming the\n\nIJ's adverse credibility finding because the IJ's finding is not\n\nsupported by substantial evidence in the record when viewed as a\n\nwhole.       We   disagree.      The    IJ   specifically   described   the\n\ninconsistencies upon which he relied, and those inconsistencies are\n\nsupported by the record.        See Long v. Gonzáles, 422 F.3d 37, 40\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (\"The IJ must provide specific reasons for its\n\ndetermination that, in turn, are supported by the evidence.\").\n\nMoreover, those inconsistencies are substantial and go to the heart\n\nof Prela's claims of persecution and torture.               See Bojorques-\n\nVillanueva v. INS, 194 F.3d 14, 16 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"[A]n adverse\n\ncredibility determination cannot rest on trivia but must be based\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fon discrepancies that involved the heart of the asylum claim.\"\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).              In particular, the strongest\n\nevidence in support of Prela's claims concerns his June 24, 2001\n\narrest and beating, but his contradictory testimony casts into\n\nsubstantial doubt not only the extent of the incident but also the\n\nveracity of Prela's statements.\n\n             Prela   argues   in    this    court    that    the     contradictory\n\nstatements noted by the IJ are in fact not inconsistent.                      With\n\nrespect to his father's death, he points out that the ex-communists\n\nwhom   he   testified   assassinated        his    father    are   criminals,   as\n\ndescribed by the Democratic Party's letter.              He also explains that\n\nhe joined the Democratic Party in 1996, explaining the \"issue date\"\n\non his membership card, but that the particular card with his new\n\nlast name was issued much later, after he had changed his name to\n\nPrela.      We note first that Prela apparently did not make these\n\narguments before the BIA, and so they are waived.                       Molina de\n\nMassenet     v.   Gonzáles,   485    F.3d     661,     664    (1st    Cir.   2007)\n\n(\"[A]rguments not raised before the BIA are waived due to a failure\n\nto exhaust administrative remedies.\").              In any event, Prela still\n\nhas not explained the more significant inconsistencies regarding\n\nthe June 2001 incident.\n\n             Second, Prela argues that the IJ erred in denying him\n\nrelief under the CAT because he did not consider the CAT claim\n\nseparate from the asylum claim.            Prela is incorrect, however.         It\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fis clear from the IJ's decision that he considered whether Prela\n\nhad satisfied the standard for CAT relief. He correctly identified\n\nPrela's burden of proof, stating \"that it is more likely than not\n\nthat he would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of\n\nremoval,\" and that \"[t]he torture must be inflicted by or at the\n\ninstigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public\n\nofficial or other person acting in an official capacity.\"   See Ang\n\nv. Gonzáles, 430 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir. 2005); 8 C.F.R. § 208.16\n\n(c)(2).   He then based his denial of relief on the inconsistencies\n\nin the record previously described, finding that Prela's testimony\n\ndid not establish that it was more likely than not that he would be\n\ntortured if returned to Albania.   The record does not compel us to\n\nconclude otherwise.   See Stroni v. Gonzáles, 454 F.3d 82, 90 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n                          III. Conclusion\n\n           For the reasons enumerated above, we deny the petition\n\nfor review.\n\n           Denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

As a result, the IJ\n\ndenied Prela's claims and ordered him removed.\n\n            The BIA upheld the IJ's denial of relief to the extent\n\nthat it was based upon an adverse credibility finding.2                       The BIA\n\nstated   that   it   found    no    reason     to   disturb   the   IJ's      adverse\n\ncredibility determination, noting that on appeal Prela had not\n\naddressed   the   \"significant       inconsistencies      between       the    asylum\n\napplication, testimony and documentary evidence on matters which go\n\nto the heart of the claim.\"\n\n\n\n2\n   The IJ had also found that \"[e]ven viewing [Prela's] testimony\nin the best possible light to him, . . . what he has actually shown\nis that while participating in demonstrations which ended up\nviolently, that he was abused by police.\"\n\n                                       -5-\n\f                               II. Discussion\n\n           While we normally review the BIA's decision as the final\n\nagency order, we look to the IJ's decision to the extent it was\n\nadopted and affirmed by the BIA.

We   disagree.      The    IJ   specifically   described   the\n\ninconsistencies upon which he relied, and those inconsistencies are\n\nsupported by the record.        See Long v. Gonzáles, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201801\"><a href=\"/opinion/201801/long-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 40\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (\"The IJ must provide specific reasons for its\n\ndetermination that, in turn, are supported by the evidence.\").\n\nMoreover, those inconsistencies are substantial and go to the heart\n\nof Prela's claims of persecution and torture.               See Bojorques-\n\nVillanueva v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198686\"><a href=\"/opinion/198686/bojorquez-villanueva-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 16 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"[A]n adverse\n\ncredibility determination cannot rest on trivia but must be based\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fon discrepancies that involved the heart of the asylum claim.\"\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted)).              In particular, the strongest\n\nevidence in support of Prela's claims concerns his June 24, 2001\n\narrest and beating, but his contradictory testimony casts into\n\nsubstantial doubt not only the extent of the incident but also the\n\nveracity of Prela's statements.\n\n             Prela   argues   in    this    court    that    the     contradictory\n\nstatements noted by the IJ are in fact not inconsistent.                      With\n\nrespect to his father's death, he points out that the ex-communists\n\nwhom   he   testified   assassinated        his    father    are   criminals,   as\n\ndescribed by the Democratic Party's letter.              He also explains that\n\nhe joined the Democratic Party in 1996, explaining the \"issue date\"\n\non his membership card, but that the particular card with his new\n\nlast name was issued much later, after he had changed his name to\n\nPrela.      We note first that Prela apparently did not make these\n\narguments before the BIA, and so they are waived.                       Molina de\n\nMassenet     v.

In any event, Prela still\n\nhas not explained the more significant inconsistencies regarding\n\nthe June 2001 incident.\n\n             Second, Prela argues that the IJ erred in denying him\n\nrelief under the CAT because he did not consider the CAT claim\n\nseparate from the asylum claim.            Prela is incorrect, however.         It\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fis clear from the IJ's decision that he considered whether Prela\n\nhad satisfied the standard for CAT relief. He correctly identified\n\nPrela's burden of proof, stating \"that it is more likely than not\n\nthat he would be tortured if removed to the proposed country of\n\nremoval,\" and that \"[t]he torture must be inflicted by or at the\n\ninstigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public\n\nofficial or other person acting in an official capacity.\"   See Ang\n\nv.

He then based his denial of relief on the inconsistencies\n\nin the record previously described, finding that Prela's testimony\n\ndid not establish that it was more likely than not that he would be\n\ntortured if returned to Albania.   The record does not compel us to\n\nconclude otherwise.   See Stroni v.
