William E. Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                   Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n                      and Besosa,* District Judge.\n\n\n\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, and Kenneth P.\nMadden, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n     James M. Fox for appellant.\n\n\n\n                            August 6, 2008\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.\n\f            LIPEZ,    Circuit    Judge.          This     case     crystalizes   the\n\ndifficulties confronted by defendants - and district court judges -\n\nas they navigate the turbulent waters of Booker and its aftermath.\n\nSee United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 245 (2005).                           The\n\ndefendant, Antron Russell, has already been sentenced three times\n\nfollowing   his     guilty   plea   on    a    charge   of    distributing    crack\n\ncocaine.    Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in Booker, Russell\n\nwas sentenced to 235 months of imprisonment, the bottom of the\n\napplicable guideline range.         After we remanded for resentencing in\n\nlight of Booker, he was sentenced to 151 months, a downward\n\nvariance    based    upon    a   20:1    ratio     that      the   district   court\n\nsubstituted for the 100:1 ratio under the then-applicable guideline\n\nregime for offenses involving crack as opposed to powder cocaine.\n\nWe subsequently rejected the calculation of variances based upon\n\n\"the categorical substitution of a 20:1 crack-to-powder ratio for\n\nthe 100:1 ratio embedded in the sentencing guidelines\" in United\n\nStates v. Pho, 433 F.3d 53, 64 (1st Cir. 2006).                        Accordingly,\n\nRussell's sentence was vacated.           Upon remand, he was sentenced to\n\n180 months.\n\n            Russell now appeals that sentence, contending that it is\n\nnot reasonable.        While his appeal was pending before us, the\n\nSupreme Court decided Kimbrough v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 558\n\n(2007), holding that \"it would not be an abuse of discretion for a\n\ndistrict court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fthat the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence 'greater than\n\nnecessary' to achieve § 3553(a)'s purposes, even in a mine-run\n\ncase.\"    Id. at 575.          Russell seeks to parlay Kimbrough into a\n\nfourth sentencing.        Because we conclude that the district court\n\nanticipated the holding in Kimbrough, considered the crack/powder\n\ndisparity as part of its individualized § 3553(a) analysis at the\n\nmost recent sentencing, and imposed a reasonable sentence, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n           Russell     was     charged    with   possession   with   intent    to\n\ndistribute cocaine base in excess of fifty grams, in violation of\n\n21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A).1               He entered a guilty plea\n\npursuant to a plea agreement, stipulating that the quantity of\n\ncocaine base involved in the offense and related conduct totaled\n\n233.74 grams.      In exchange, the government agreed to recommend the\n\nlowest prison term within the applicable guideline range, advocate\n\nfor   either   a   two-   or    three-level      decrease   for   acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility, and refrain from filing for a sentence enhancement\n\nunder 21 U.S.C. § 851 and seeking an official victim enhancement\n\nunder § 3A1.2 of the sentencing guidelines.\n\n           At the plea colloquy, the government reviewed the factual\n\nbasis for the plea.       On March 8, 2003, local police learned that a\n\n\n      1\n      At the plea colloquy, the government characterized the drugs\nas \"cocaine base or crack cocaine\" and used these two terms\ninterchangeably.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fman fitting Russell's description was planning to sell crack at a\n\nMcDonald's restaurant in Cranston, Rhode Island.           At the scheduled\n\ntime, Russell arrived at the McDonald's parking lot in a car driven\n\nby a woman.      Police officers approached both sides of the car and\n\nremoved the driver.       As this was happening, Russell reached over\n\nfrom the passenger seat and drove the car forward and backward in\n\nan attempt to escape.       Three officers were struck by the car, and\n\nthe police ultimately opened fire on the car to stop it.               Russell\n\nwas carrying 141.24 grams of crack cocaine in his pocket.               At the\n\ncolloquy, Russell also admitted to selling additional quantities of\n\ncrack cocaine, totaling 92.5 grams, to undercover officers on three\n\nprior occasions in late 2002 and early 2003.\n\n           At the first sentencing hearing, held on August 27, 2004,\n\nthe   district    court   calculated      Russell's   applicable      guideline\n\nsentencing    range.2     Based    on   the   stipulated   drug   quantities,\n\nRussell's base offense level was set at 34.           The court found that\n\na three-level reduction for timely acceptance of responsibility and\n\na two-level victim-related enhancement for reckless endangerment,\n\npursuant to § 3C1.2, were appropriate, yielding a total offense\n\nlevel of 33.      Russell's 13 criminal history points placed him in\n\nCriminal   History      Category   (\"CHC\")    VI,   producing     a   guideline\n\nsentencing range of 235 to 293 months.\n\n\n\n      2\n      These guideline calculations have remained consistent\nthroughout the three sentencing hearings in this case.\n\n                                        -4-\n\f               Russell   objected     to   the   two-level   enhancement    for\n\nreckless endangerment on the ground that, in light of Blakely v.\n\nWashington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), the government had not met its\n\nburden of proving the facts predicate to the two-level enhancement\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.          Id. at 303.     The court rejected this\n\nview, stating that there was no Blakely issue because \"in the plea\n\ncolloquy the Government outlined all of the facts that are alleged\n\nto   support    this   enhancement\"    and   Russell   had   agreed   to   that\n\noutline.       The court imposed a 235-month sentence, the lowest\n\nsentence available within the guideline range.3\n\n            Russell appealed his first sentence based on the Blakely\n\nissue.     However, while the appeal was pending, the Supreme Court\n\ndecided Booker and the government conceded that a remand was\n\nrequired for resentencing under an advisory guideline regime.               We\n\naccepted that concession and remanded.\n\n            In his written submissions and at the second sentencing\n\nhearing, held on October 28, 2005, Russell asked the court to\n\nimpose a 120-month sentence – the applicable mandatory minimum.\n\nRussell asserted that a 120-month sentence would better serve the\n\ninterest of rehabilitation than the much longer guideline sentence.\n\nHe also claimed that his criminal history score was overstated and\n\n\n      3\n      The court also sentenced Russell to five years of supervised\nrelease, with special conditions requiring that he seek full-time\nemployment and participate in a substance abuse program. These\nconditions remained consistent through each of the three\nsentencings and Russell has not challenged them here.\n\n                                      -5-\n\fargued   that   the   100:1       ratio   for    crack   versus     powder   cocaine\n\nembedded   within     the    sentencing         guidelines    was    unjust.       The\n\ngovernment countered by highlighting Russell's long list of adult\n\narrests and convictions and noting that the three short prison\n\nsentences he had served previously had not deterred his criminal\n\nconduct.   The government also contended that \"it should be left to\n\nCongress, not the Courts, to modify or even abrogate in its\n\nentirety the sentencing distinctions between crack cocaine and\n\npowder cocaine,\" and noted that if different district courts used\n\ndifferent ratios to calculate post-Booker sentences for crack\n\ncocaine, substantial sentencing disparities would arise.                          The\n\ngovernment advocated for the reimposition of a 235-month sentence.\n\n           The district court stated its categorical disagreement\n\nwith the 100:1 ratio in the sentencing guidelines.                         The court\n\nstated that a 20:1 ratio, which would have produced a 151- to 188-\n\nmonth guideline range in Russell's case, should be used to guide\n\nthe   application     of    the   advisory      guidelines.         The   court   then\n\nconsidered the § 3553 factors and imposed a sentence of 151 months.\n\n           Russell appealed this sentence, arguing that it was\n\nunreasonable even though it was substantially below the applicable\n\nguideline sentencing range. The government cross-appealed, arguing\n\nthat the district court's categorical rejection of the 100:1 ratio\n\nviolated our holding in United States v. Pho, 433 F.3d 53 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) – a case decided about two months after Russell's second\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fsentence was imposed. We remanded for resentencing in light of Pho\n\nwithout addressing the reasonableness of the sentence.\n\n               Russell filed a motion to continue his third sentencing\n\npending the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Claiborne,\n\n127 S. Ct. 551 (2006),4 and the final approval of amendments\n\nproposed by the Sentencing Commission to the guidelines applicable\n\nto crack cocaine offenses.5      The court denied the continuance, and\n\nthen explained at the third sentencing hearing on May 10, 2007,\n\nthat it had concluded that a continuance was unnecessary because it\n\nhas substantial discretion to vary from the guideline sentence,\n\nnotwithstanding our rejection of categorical ratio substitutions in\n\nPho.       The court also concluded that it could take into account the\n\nproposed crack cocaine guideline amendments in considering the\n\noverall reasonableness of Russell's sentence.       However, the court\n\n\n       4\n      Claiborne was vacated as moot when the defendant died. 127\nS. Ct. 2245 (2007) (per curiam). The issues raised in the case\nwere then decided in Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 586 (2007).\nThe Court held that appellate courts in reviewing a non-guideline\nsentence may \"take the degree of variance into account,\" but the\nCourt rejected \"an appellate rule that requires 'extraordinary'\ncircumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines.\" Id.\nat 595.\n       5\n      The Sentencing Commission's alteration to the guidelines\nbecame effective on November 1, 2007, reducing the base offense\nlevel associated with each quantity of crack by two levels.\nKimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 569. Accordingly, if the new guidelines\nhad been in effect when Russell was sentenced, his guideline\nsentencing range would have been 188 to 235 months.       See U.S.\nSentencing Guidelines Manual § 2D1.1(c) (Drug Quantity Table)\n(Supp. 2008); id. ch. 5, pt. A (Sentencing Table)(Offense level 31,\nCHC VI).   His 180-month sentence thus falls below the revised\nguidelines for his offense.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fexplained that it had \"undervalued\" several aggravating factors at\n\nthe previous sentencing.      The court particularly noted the large\n\namount of crack cocaine involved and Russell's violent escape\n\nattempt, which had forced officers to fire their weapons in a busy\n\nMcDonald's parking lot, where children might have been endangered.\n\nThe court imposed a 180-month sentence.\n\n            Russell   then   filed     this   appeal,    claiming    that   his\n\nsentence was unreasonable.           While the appeal was pending, the\n\nSupreme Court decided Kimbrough. Russell argues that the Kimbrough\n\ndecision    further   supports   his     contention     that   his   180-month\n\nsentence    was   unreasonably   high.        The   government   counters   by\n\nasserting that the district court anticipated the holding in\n\nKimbrough and properly considered all of the relevant factors in\n\nmaking the individualized determination called for by § 3553(a).6\n\nWe agree.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            \"We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence\n\nfor abuse of discretion, but we first consider whether the court\n\n\n\n     6\n      The government also argues that any procedural error was\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it is unlikely that the\ndistrict court would impose a lower sentence if the case were\nremanded. Because we conclude that there was no error, we need not\naddress the government's harmless error analysis. Also, the plain\nerror analysis we applied in our recent decision in United States\nv. Matos, 2008 WL 2687385 (1st Cir. July 10, 2008), is\ninapplicable. There the Kimbrough issue was not preserved. More\nimportantly, as we explain, here there was no Kimbrough error at\nall by the sentencing judge.\n\n                                      -8-\n\fbelow committed a 'significant procedural error, such as . . .\n\ntreating      the   Guidelines     as   mandatory.'\"           United    States    v.\n\nDeCologero, 530 F.3d 36, 70 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Gall v. United\n\nStates, 128 S. Ct. 586, 597 (2007)).               Accordingly, we turn first to\n\nRussell's contention that the district court committed a procedural\n\nerror by failing to consider the crack/powder cocaine disparity as\n\nexplicitly permitted now by Kimbrough.\n\nA.    Pho and Kimbrough\n\n              In Pho, we held that \"the district court erred as a\n\nmatter of law when it constructed a new sentencing range based on\n\nthe categorical substitution of a 20:1 crack-to-powder ratio for a\n\n100:1 ratio embedded in the sentencing guidelines.\"                     433 F.3d at\n\n64.    We explained that \"sentencing decisions must be done case by\n\ncase and must be grounded in case-specific considerations, not in\n\ngeneral      disagreement   with    broad-based        policies    enunciated      by\n\nCongress or the [Sentencing] Commission.\"                     Id. at 64-65.       Our\n\nholding was thus limited to a rejection of a categorical, policy-\n\nbased ratio substitution.          We cautioned that \"we [did] not intend\n\nto diminish the discretion that, after Booker, district courts\n\nenjoy   in    sentencing    matters     or    to    suggest    that,    in   a   drug-\n\ntrafficking case, the nature of the contraband and/or the severity\n\nof a projected guideline sentence may not be taken into account on\n\na case-by-case basis.\"       Id. at 65.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\f           In Kimbrough, the Supreme Court reversed a Fourth Circuit\n\ndecision that had taken a far more restrictive approach than we had\n\nin Pho.   The Fourth Circuit had held that \"a sentence 'outside the\n\nguidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a\n\ndisagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder\n\ncocaine offenses.'\"   Kimbrough, 128 S. Ct. at 565 (quoting United\n\nStates v. Kimbrough, 174 Fed. Appx. 798, 799 (4th Cir. 2006) (per\n\ncuriam)). The Supreme Court rejected the Fourth Circuit's approach\n\nbecause it made \"the crack/powder disparity effectively mandatory.\"\n\nId. at 564.    The Court held instead that a sentencing judge \"may\n\ndetermine . . . that, in a particular case, a within-Guidelines\n\nsentence is 'greater than necessary' to serve the objectives of\n\nsentencing,\" as set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), and that \"[i]n\n\nmaking that determination, the judge may consider the disparity\n\nbetween the Guidelines' treatment of crack and powder cocaine\n\noffenses.\"    Id.\n\n           Although the Kimbrough Court listed Pho as one of the\n\ncircuit court decisions that had taken the view that a \"sentencing\n\ncourt may not impose a sentence outside the Guidelines range based\n\non its disagreement with the crack/powder disparity,\" Kimbrough,\n\n128 S. Ct. at 566 n.4, we respectfully question that assessment.7\n\n\n     7\n      The Supreme Court vacated our decision in Pho, along with the\ndecisions of other circuits that the Supreme Court deemed\nincompatible with Kimbrough. We obviously accept that decision.\nWe remanded Pho to the district court for resentencing in light of\nthe Supreme Court's decision.      However, our fidelity to the\n\n                                -10-\n\fIndeed, there has been widespread misunderstanding of Pho in this\n\ncircuit.     We rejected in Pho the categorical substitution by the\n\nsentencing judge of a lower ratio – effectively, a constructive\n\nguideline sentencing range – for all crack cocaine offenders.\n\nHowever, we expressly preserved the discretion of the sentencing\n\njudge to consider the \"nature of the contraband and/or the severity\n\nof a projected guideline sentence . . . on a case-by-case basis.\"\n\nPho, 433 F.3d at 65. This case-by-case, individualized analysis is\n\nprecisely the approach endorsed by the Supreme Court in Kimbrough.\n\nIn detailing the method used by the sentencing court in Kimbrough,\n\nthe Court approvingly noted that \"the [sentencing] court did not\n\npurport to establish a ratio of its own.        Rather it appropriately\n\nframed its final determination in line with § 3553(a)'s overarching\n\ninstruction to 'impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than\n\nnecessary'    to     accomplish   the   sentencing   goals   advanced   in\n\n§ 3553(a)(2).\"       128 S. Ct. at 575.     Thus, at its core, Pho is\n\nactually consistent with Kimbrough: both decisions emphasize the\n\nimportance      of      individualized,      case-by-case      sentencing\n\ndeterminations, rather than a reliance on generalized ratios.\n\n           As we recently explained, \"the Kimbrough Court's organic\n\nreading of section 3553(a) suggests that a sentencing judge should\n\nengage in a . . . holistic inquiry,\" by considering \"a tapestry of\n\n\ndecisions of the Supreme Court does not preclude us from expressing\nreservations about the Supreme Court's characterization of one of\nour decisions.\n\n                                    -11-\n\ffactors,   through     which    runs    the   thread    of   [the]    overarching\n\nprinciple\" of parsimony. United States v. Rodríguez, 527 F.3d 221,\n\n228 (1st Cir. 2008).        After Kimbrough, it is clear that the undue\n\nharshness that may result from the 100:1 crack/powder ratio is\n\nproperly considered as one of those factors woven into the tapestry\n\nas the district court considers what sentence is \"sufficient, but\n\nnot greater than necessary\" in each individual case.\n\nB.    Russell's Third Sentencing Hearing\n\n            The question, then, is whether the district court avoided\n\nprocedural error at Russell's third sentencing hearing by properly\n\nconsidering      all   of   the      relevant    factors     –     including   the\n\ncrack/powder disparity – in making its § 3553(a) determination that\n\na    180-month   sentence      was   \"sufficient,      but   not    greater    than\n\nnecessary\" in this particular case.             Our review of the transcript\n\nreveals no error.\n\n            At the hearing, the district court began by addressing\n\nits rationale for denying Russell's motion for a continuance,\n\nexplaining that Pho did not substantially constrain its discretion:\n\n            So the reason that I really felt that, on that\n            ground, that I wasn't inclined to grant the\n            motion is that I feel that we have a\n            substantial discretion to impose a non-\n            guideline sentence, and what Pho said really\n            was that district courts should not get into\n            the business of defining a, sort of a uniform\n            or across-the-board policy basis with respect\n            to those kinds of sentences, but rather should\n            be doing them on a case-by-case basis, but\n            sort of left open, I think very clearly left\n            open [to] the discretion of the district court\n\n                                       -12-\n\f          to formulate a sentence that is whatever the\n          Court feels is a reasonable sentence.\n\nThis view of Pho is, as we noted above, consistent with the Supreme\n\nCourt's later holding in Kimbrough.     Indeed, we think that the\n\ndistrict court here presciently anticipated the guidance that the\n\nCourt would provide in Kimbrough.   Later in the hearing, the court\n\nstated:\n\n          [W]e have been told by the Court of Appeals\n          that the application of a rigid 20-to-1 ratio\n          was error and that that's not the way to go\n          about doing these sentences. And I think I've\n          said before, and sort of reflecting on this\n          over the last few years, I think the Court of\n          Appeals was probably right about that. And as\n          to the policy part of it, I think that our job\n          is to look at these cases on a real case-by-\n          case basis and try to come up with a sentence\n          that is appropriate.\n\n          The court clearly – and correctly – believed that it had\n\nthe authority to consider the crack/powder disparity as one factor\n\nin that case-by-case analysis. Referencing the proposed amendments\n\nto the crack sentencing guidelines, the court explained:\n\n          The history of these amendments is that\n          Congress has rejected them, although there's\n          some reason to believe they would accept this\n          one. But, again, as I'm looking at it, I'm\n          inclined to think that you can argue, I\n          suppose, that this is further evidence that\n          the guideline range in this case is not\n          reasonable.   And you might have a lot of\n          arguments that sort of fit into that – a\n          number of arguments that you would make in\n          order to say it's not reasonable, including\n          various   statements    of   the   Sentencing\n          Commission about crack cocaine sentences over\n          the last few years, and this would just be an\n          additional item to support that argument.\n\n                               -13-\n\f                    From my point of view, I feel that I've\n            got the discretion to put all of that into the\n            basket and try to figure out what a reasonable\n            sentence is under the advisory guideline\n            system.\n                    So once again, I'm not sure I need to\n            see that amendment either be adopted or not be\n            adopted in order to figure out, from my point\n            of view, what I think a reasonable sentence\n            is.\n\nThe court concluded that a reasonable sentence for Russell was 180\n\nmonths, 29 months longer than the 151-month sentence that the court\n\nhad imposed at the second sentencing but still well below the\n\nbottom of Russell's guideline sentencing range.\n\n            Given the court's understanding of the discretion it\n\nretained   after     Pho   in    fashioning       an   individualized   sentence,\n\nRussell's contention that the constraints of Pho produced the\n\nlonger sentence at his third sentencing is untenable.                Rather, the\n\ncourt    explained    that      it   had    \"undervalued\"    other   factors   at\n\nRussell's second sentencing. The court described being \"struck\" by\n\nthree factors in reviewing the              case:\n\n            One is that I think the quantity of cocaine\n            here was pretty substantial. And there were\n            several transactions, not just one.         The\n            amount of money involved was substantial, and\n            I think these facts pointed to your role as a\n            dealer as somewhat more substantial than other\n            defendants that I've seen. . . .\n                   The second thing that struck me is that\n            the Government did not file an 851 enhancement8\n\n\n     8\n      If the government had filed an information under 21 U.S.C.\n§ 851 stating a prior drug felony conviction, Russell would have\nbeen subject to an increased statutory mandatory minimum sentence\nof 20 years. See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A), 851(a).\n\n                                           -14-\n\f           in this case, which it certainly could\n           have . . . .\n                  And then the third thing that struck me\n           was that, in rereading the facts of the case,\n           was the attempt to escape and the fact that\n           three officers were hit by the car, the fact\n           that this all occurred at a McDonald's\n           restaurant, a busy place.    There could have\n           been children running around.     And I think\n           that's a disturbing fact, even perhaps more\n           disturbing is the fact that the police\n           officers had to fire their weapons in response\n           to the attempt to escape.\n\nThese three factors led the court to conclude that \"a somewhat\n\ngreater   sentence    than     what    [it   had]    previously      imposed   is\n\nappropriate.\"       Thus, the record of Russell's third sentencing\n\nhearing   reveals     that     the     district      court     considered      the\n\ncrack/cocaine disparity as well as a host of other individualized\n\nfactors in reaching a holistic assessment of the sentence called\n\nfor by § 3553.    We perceive no procedural error.\n\nC.   Substantive Reasonableness\n\n           Having     satisfied       ourselves     that     the    sentence   is\n\nprocedurally     sound,   we    proceed      \"to    review    the    substantive\n\nreasonableness of the sentence, taking into account the totality of\n\nthe circumstances . . . [and giving] 'due deference to the district\n\ncourt's decision that the § 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify\n\nthe extent of the variance.'\"          United States v. Martin, 520 F.3d\n\n87, 92 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Gall, 128 S. Ct. at 597).\n\n           Russell points to two factors that he contends should\n\nhave driven his sentence even lower.               First, he argues that the\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fdistrict   court   did    not     adequately   consider    the    crack/powder\n\ndisparity in arriving at his sentence.            However, we have no reason\n\nto question the adequacy of the size of the downward departure the\n\ndistrict court granted on the basis of the disparity here.                  The\n\nrecord of all three sentencing hearings, read together, suggests\n\nthat there were no other substantial mitigating factors that could\n\nexplain the significant downward variance here.                  At the second\n\nsentencing hearing, the only factor the court discussed that would\n\nlead to a below-guideline sentence was the crack/powder disparity.\n\nSimilarly, at the third sentencing hearing, the only mitigating\n\nfactors specifically referenced by the court were the history of\n\nproposed amendments to the crack/powder ratio in the guidelines and\n\nthe \"yo-yo effect with respect to sentencing\" that Russell had had\n\nto endure as a result of the several remands in the case.             Thus, it\n\nappears that the crack/powder disparity accounts for the bulk of\n\nthe fifty-five-month downward variance in Russell's sentence.\n\n           Second, Russell contends that the district court failed\n\nto adequately account for his personal circumstances in the third\n\nsentencing.   He describes those personal circumstances as having\n\n\"limited education and employment opportunities, marijuana and\n\nalcohol addictions, and a young child.\"             We fail to see how this\n\nvague description places Russell so far from \"the mine-run of\n\ncriminal defendants,\" see Martin, 520 F.3d at 95, as to require the\n\ndistrict   court   to    impose    a   sentence    even   farther   below   the\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\fguideline range than the 180-month sentence it imposed.        Russell's\n\narguments    fall   far   short   of     undermining   the   substantive\n\nreasonableness of his sentence.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\f",

Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, and Kenneth P. Madden, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.</p>\n<p>James M. Fox, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Before LIPEZ and HOWARD, Circuit Judges, and BESOSA,<sup>[*]</sup> District Judge.</p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This case crystalizes the difficulties confronted by defendants  and district court judges  as they navigate the turbulent waters of <i>Booker</i> and its aftermath. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 245, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). The defendant, Antron Russell, has already been sentenced three times following his guilty plea on a charge of distributing crack cocaine. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Booker,</i> Russell was sentenced to 235 months of imprisonment, the bottom of the applicable guideline range. After we remanded for resentencing in light of <i>Booker,</i> he was sentenced to 151 months, a downward variance based upon a 20:1 ratio that the district court substituted for the 100:1 ratio under the then-applicable guideline regime for offenses involving crack as opposed to powder cocaine. We subsequently rejected the calculation of variances based upon \"the categorical substitution of a 20:1 crack-to-powder ratio for the 100:1 ratio embedded in the sentencing guidelines\" in <i>United States v. Pho,</i> 433 F.3d 53, 64 (1st Cir.2006). Accordingly, Russell's sentence was vacated. Upon remand, he was sentenced to 180 months.</p>\n<p>Russell now appeals that sentence, contending that it is not reasonable. While his appeal was pending before us, the Supreme Court decided <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), holding that \"it would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence `greater than necessary' to achieve § 3553(a)'s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 575. Russell seeks to parlay <i>Kimbrough</i> into a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> fourth sentencing. Because we conclude that the district court anticipated the holding in <i>Kimbrough,</i> considered the crack/powder disparity as part of its individualized § 3553(a) analysis at the most recent sentencing, and imposed a reasonable sentence, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Russell was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine base in excess of fifty grams, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A).<sup>[1]</sup> He entered a guilty plea pursuant to a plea agreement, stipulating that the quantity of cocaine base involved in the offense and related conduct totaled 233.74 grams. In exchange, the government agreed to recommend the lowest prison term within the applicable guideline range, advocate for either a two- or three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility, and refrain from filing for a sentence enhancement under 21 U.S.C. § 851 and seeking an official victim enhancement under § 3A1.2 of the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p>At the plea colloquy, the government reviewed the factual basis for the plea. On March 8, 2003, local police learned that a man fitting Russell's description was planning to sell crack at a McDonald's restaurant in Cranston, Rhode Island. At the scheduled time, Russell arrived at the McDonald's parking lot in a car driven by a woman. Police officers approached both sides of the car and removed the driver. As this was happening, Russell reached over from the passenger seat and drove the car forward and backward in an attempt to escape. Three officers were struck by the car, and the police ultimately opened fire on the car to stop it. Russell was carrying 141.24 grams of crack cocaine in his pocket. At the colloquy, Russell also admitted to selling additional quantities of crack cocaine, totaling 92.5 grams, to undercover officers on three prior occasions in late 2002 and early 2003.</p>\n<p>At the first sentencing hearing, held on August 27, 2004, the district court calculated Russell's applicable guideline sentencing range.<sup>[2]</sup> Based on the stipulated drug quantities, Russell's base offense level was set at 34. The court found that a three-level reduction for timely acceptance of responsibility and a two-level victim-related enhancement for reckless endangerment, pursuant to § 3C1.2, were appropriate, yielding a total offense level of 33. Russell's 13 criminal history points placed him in Criminal History Category (\"CHC\") VI, producing a guideline sentencing range of 235 to 293 months.</p>\n<p>Russell objected to the two-level enhancement for reckless endangerment on the ground that, in light of <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the government had not met its burden of proving the facts predicate to the two-level enhancement beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>Id.</i> at 303, 124 S.Ct. 2531. The court rejected this view, stating that there was no <i>Blakely</i> issue because \"in the plea colloquy the Government outlined all of the facts that are alleged to support this enhancement\" and Russell had agreed to that outline. The court imposed a 235-month sentence, the lowest sentence available within the guideline range.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> Russell appealed his first sentence based on the <i>Blakely</i> issue. However, while the appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided <i>Booker</i> and the government conceded that a remand was required for resentencing under an advisory guideline regime. We accepted that concession and remanded.</p>\n<p>In his written submissions and at the second sentencing hearing, held on October 28, 2005, Russell asked the court to impose a 120-month sentence  the applicable mandatory minimum. Russell asserted that a 120-month sentence would better serve the interest of rehabilitation than the much longer guideline sentence. He also claimed that his criminal history score was overstated and argued that the 100:1 ratio for crack versus powder cocaine embedded within the sentencing guidelines was unjust. The government countered by highlighting Russell's long list of adult arrests and convictions and noting that the three short prison sentences he had served previously had not deterred his criminal conduct. The government also contended that \"it should be left to Congress, not the Courts, to modify or even abrogate in its entirety the sentencing distinctions between crack cocaine and powder cocaine,\" and noted that if different district courts used different ratios to calculate post-<i>Booker</i> sentences for crack cocaine, substantial sentencing disparities would arise. The government advocated for the reimposition of a 235-month sentence.</p>\n<p>The district court stated its categorical disagreement with the 100:1 ratio in the sentencing guidelines. The court stated that a 20:1 ratio, which would have produced a 151- to 188-month guideline range in Russell's case, should be used to guide the application of the advisory guidelines. The court then considered the § 3553 factors and imposed a sentence of 151 months.</p>\n<p>Russell appealed this sentence, arguing that it was unreasonable even though it was substantially below the applicable guideline sentencing range. The government cross-appealed, arguing that the district court's categorical rejection of the 100:1 ratio violated our holding in <i>United States v. Pho,</i> 433 F.3d 53 (1st Cir.2006)  a case decided about two months after Russell's second sentence was imposed. We remanded for resentencing in light of <i>Pho</i> without addressing the reasonableness of the sentence.</p>\n<p>Russell filed a motion to continue his third sentencing pending the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Claiborne v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 551, 166 L.Ed.2d 406 (2006),<sup>[4]</sup> and the final approval of amendments proposed by the Sentencing Commission to the guidelines applicable to crack cocaine offenses.<sup>[5]</sup> The court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> denied the continuance, and then explained at the third sentencing hearing on May 10, 2007, that it had concluded that a continuance was unnecessary because it has substantial discretion to vary from the guideline sentence, notwithstanding our rejection of categorical ratio substitutions in <i>Pho.</i> The court also concluded that it could take into account the proposed crack cocaine guideline amendments in considering the overall reasonableness of Russell's sentence. However, the court explained that it had \"undervalued\" several aggravating factors at the previous sentencing. The court particularly noted the large amount of crack cocaine involved and Russell's violent escape attempt, which had forced officers to fire their weapons in a busy McDonald's parking lot, where children might have been endangered. The court imposed a 180-month sentence.</p>\n<p>Russell then filed this appeal, claiming that his sentence was unreasonable. While the appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided <i>Kimbrough.</i> Russell argues that the <i>Kimbrough</i> decision further supports his contention that his 180-month sentence was unreasonably high. The government counters by asserting that the district court anticipated the holding in <i>Kimbrough</i> and properly considered all of the relevant factors in making the individualized determination called for by § 3553(a).<sup>[6]</sup> We agree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>\"We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion, but we first consider whether the court below committed a `significant procedural error, such as ... treating the Guidelines as mandatory.'\" <i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> 530 F.3d 36, 70 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting <i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 597, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007)). Accordingly, we turn first to Russell's contention that the district court committed a procedural error by failing to consider the crack/powder cocaine disparity as explicitly permitted now by <i>Kimbrough.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Pho</i> and <i>Kimbrough</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In <i>Pho,</i> we held that \"the district court erred as a matter of law when it constructed a new sentencing range based on the categorical substitution of a 20:1 crack-to-powder ratio for a 100:1 ratio embedded in the sentencing guidelines.\" 433 F.3d at 64. We explained that \"sentencing decisions must be done case by case and must be grounded in case-specific considerations, not in general disagreement with broad-based policies enunciated by Congress or the [Sentencing] Commission.\" <i>Id.</i> at 64-65. Our holding was thus limited to a rejection of a categorical, policy-based ratio substitution. We cautioned that \"we [did] not intend to diminish the discretion that, after <i>Booker,</i> district courts enjoy in sentencing matters or to suggest that, in a drug-trafficking case, the nature of the contraband and/or the severity of a projected guideline sentence may not be taken <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> into account on a case-by-case basis.\" <i>Id.</i> at 65.</p>\n<p>In <i>Kimbrough,</i> the Supreme Court reversed a Fourth Circuit decision that had taken a far more restrictive approach than we had in <i>Pho.</i> The Fourth Circuit had held that \"a sentence `outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.'\" <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 565 (quoting <i>United States v. Kimbrough,</i> 174 Fed.Appx. 798, 799 (4th Cir. 2006) (per curiam)). The Supreme Court rejected the Fourth Circuit's approach because it made \"the crack/powder disparity effectively mandatory.\" <i>Id.</i> at 564. The Court held instead that a sentencing judge \"may determine ... that, in a particular case, a within-Guidelines sentence is `greater than necessary' to serve the objectives of sentencing,\" as set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), and that \"[i]n making that determination, the judge may consider the disparity between the Guidelines' treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Although the <i>Kimbrough</i> Court listed <i>Pho</i> as one of the circuit court decisions that had taken the view that a \"sentencing court may not impose a sentence outside the Guidelines range based on its disagreement with the crack/powder disparity,\" <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 566 n. 4, we respectfully question that assessment.<sup>[7]</sup> Indeed, there has been widespread misunderstanding of <i>Pho</i> in this circuit. We rejected in <i>Pho</i> the categorical substitution by the sentencing judge of a lower ratio  effectively, a constructive guideline sentencing range  for all crack cocaine offenders. However, we expressly preserved the discretion of the sentencing judge to consider the \"nature of the contraband and/or the severity of a projected guideline sentence ... on a case-by-case basis.\" <i>Pho,</i> 433 F.3d at 65. This case-by-case, individualized analysis is precisely the approach endorsed by the Supreme Court in <i>Kimbrough.</i> In detailing the method used by the sentencing court in <i>Kimbrough,</i> the Court approvingly noted that \"the [sentencing] court did not purport to establish a ratio of its own. Rather it appropriately framed its final determination in line with § 3553(a)'s overarching instruction to `impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary' to accomplish the sentencing goals advanced in § 3553(a)(2).\" 128 S.Ct. at 575. Thus, at its core, <i>Pho</i> is actually consistent with <i>Kimbrough:</i> both decisions emphasize the importance of individualized, case-by-case sentencing determinations, rather than a reliance on generalized ratios.</p>\n<p>As we recently explained, \"the <i>Kimbrough</i> Court's organic reading of section 3553(a) suggests that a sentencing judge should engage in a ... holistic inquiry,\" by considering \"a tapestry of factors, through which runs the thread of [the] overarching principle\" of parsimony. <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 527 F.3d 221, 228 (1st Cir. 2008). After <i>Kimbrough,</i> it is clear that the undue harshness that may result from the 100:1 crack/powder ratio is properly considered as one of those factors woven into the tapestry as the district court considers what sentence is \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" in each individual case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> B. Russell's Third Sentencing Hearing</h2>\n<p>The question, then, is whether the district court avoided procedural error at Russell's third sentencing hearing by properly considering all of the relevant factors  including the crack/powder disparity  in making its § 3553(a) determination that a 180-month sentence was \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" in this particular case. Our review of the transcript reveals no error.</p>\n<p>At the hearing, the district court began by addressing its rationale for denying Russell's motion for a continuance, explaining that <i>Pho</i> did not substantially constrain its discretion:</p>\n<blockquote>So the reason that I really felt that, on that ground, that I wasn't inclined to grant the motion is that I feel that we have a substantial discretion to impose a non-guideline sentence, and what <i>Pho</i> said really was that district courts should not get into the business of defining a, sort of a uniform or across-the-board policy basis with respect to those kinds of sentences, but rather should be doing them on a case-by-case basis, but sort of left open, I think very clearly left open [to] the discretion of the district court to formulate a sentence that is whatever the Court feels is a reasonable sentence.</blockquote>\n<p>This view of <i>Pho</i> is, as we noted above, consistent with the Supreme Court's later holding in <i>Kimbrough.</i> Indeed, we think that the district court here presciently anticipated the guidance that the Court would provide in <i>Kimbrough.</i> Later in the hearing, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>[W]e have been told by the Court of Appeals that the application of a rigid 20-to-1 ratio was error and that that's not the way to go about doing these sentences. And I think I've said before, and sort of reflecting on this over the last few years, I think the Court of Appeals was probably right about that. And as to the policy part of it, I think that our job is to look at these cases on a real case-by-case basis and try to come up with a sentence that is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p>The court clearly  and correctly  believed that it had the authority to consider the crack/powder disparity as one factor in that case-by-case analysis. Referencing the proposed amendments to the crack sentencing guidelines, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>The history of these amendments is that Congress has rejected them, although there's some reason to believe they would accept this one. But, again, as I'm looking at it, I'm inclined to think that you can argue, I suppose, that this is further evidence that the guideline range in this case is not reasonable. And you might have a lot of arguments that sort of fit into that  a number of arguments that you would make in order to say it's not reasonable, including various statements of the Sentencing Commission about crack cocaine sentences over the last few years, and this would just be an additional item to support that argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>From my point of view, I feel that I've got the discretion to put all of that into the basket and try to figure out what a reasonable sentence is under the advisory guideline system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>So once again, I'm not sure I need to see that amendment either be adopted or not be adopted in order to figure out, from my point of view, what I think a reasonable sentence is.</blockquote>\n<p>The court concluded that a reasonable sentence for Russell was 180 months, 29 months <i>longer</i> than the 151-month sentence that the court had imposed at the second sentencing but still well below the bottom of Russell's guideline sentencing range.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> Given the court's understanding of the discretion it retained after <i>Pho</i> in fashioning an individualized sentence, Russell's contention that the constraints of <i>Pho</i> produced the longer sentence at his third sentencing is untenable. Rather, the court explained that it had \"undervalued\" other factors at Russell's second sentencing. The court described being \"struck\" by three factors in reviewing the case:</p>\n<blockquote>One is that I think the quantity of cocaine here was pretty substantial. And there were several transactions, not just one. The amount of money involved was substantial, and I think these facts pointed to your role as a dealer as somewhat more substantial than other defendants that I've seen....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The second thing that struck me is that the Government did not file an 851 enhancement<sup>[8]</sup> in this case, which it certainly could have....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And then the third thing that struck me was that, in rereading the facts of the case, was the attempt to escape and the fact that three officers were hit by the car, the fact that this all occurred at a McDonald's restaurant, a busy place. There could have been children running around. And I think that's a disturbing fact, even perhaps more disturbing is the fact that the police officers had to fire their weapons in response to the attempt to escape.</blockquote>\n<p>These three factors led the court to conclude that \"a somewhat greater sentence than what [it had] previously imposed is appropriate.\" Thus, the record of Russell's third sentencing hearing reveals that the district court considered the crack/cocaine disparity as well as a host of other individualized factors in reaching a holistic assessment of the sentence called for by § 3553. We perceive no procedural error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Substantive Reasonableness</h2>\n<p>Having satisfied ourselves that the sentence is procedurally sound, we proceed \"to review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, taking into account the totality of the circumstances ... [and giving] `due deference to the district court's decision that the § 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.'\" <i>United States v. Martin,</i> 520 F.3d 87, 92 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p>Russell points to two factors that he contends should have driven his sentence even lower. First, he argues that the district court did not adequately consider the crack/powder disparity in arriving at his sentence. However, we have no reason to question the adequacy of the size of the downward departure the district court granted on the basis of the disparity here. The record of all three sentencing hearings, read together, suggests that there were no other substantial mitigating factors that could explain the significant downward variance here. At the second sentencing hearing, the only factor the court discussed that would lead to a below-guideline sentence was the crack/powder disparity. Similarly, at the third sentencing hearing, the only mitigating factors specifically referenced by the court were the history of proposed amendments to the crack/powder ratio in the guidelines and the \"yo-yo effect with respect to sentencing\" that Russell had had to endure as a result of the several remands in the case. Thus, it appears that the crack/powder disparity accounts for the bulk of the fifty-five-month <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> downward variance in Russell's sentence.</p>\n<p>Second, Russell contends that the district court failed to adequately account for his personal circumstances in the third sentencing. He describes those personal circumstances as having \"limited education and employment opportunities, marijuana and alcohol addictions, and a young child.\" We fail to see how this vague description places Russell so far from \"the mine-run of criminal defendants,\" <i>see </i><i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 95, as to <i>require</i> the district court to impose a sentence even farther below the guideline range than the 180-month sentence it imposed. Russell's arguments fall far short of undermining the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  At the plea colloquy, the government characterized the drugs as \"cocaine base or crack cocaine\" and used these two terms interchangeably.</p>\n<p>[2]  These guideline calculations have remained consistent throughout the three sentencing hearings in this case.</p>\n<p>[3]  The court also sentenced Russell to five years of supervised release, with special conditions requiring that he seek full-time employment and participate in a substance abuse program. These conditions remained consistent through each of the three sentencings and Russell has not challenged them here.</p>\n<p>[4]  <i>Claiborne</i> was vacated as moot when the defendant died. ___ U.S. ___, 127 S.Ct. 2245, 167 L.Ed.2d 1080 (2007) (per curiam). The issues raised in the case were then decided in <i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 586, 169 L.Ed.2d 445 (2007). The Court held that appellate courts in reviewing a non-guideline sentence may \"take the degree of variance into account,\" but the Court rejected \"an appellate rule that requires `extraordinary' circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines.\" <i>Id.</i> at 595.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Sentencing Commission's alteration to the guidelines became effective on November 1, 2007, reducing the base offense level associated with each quantity of crack by two levels. <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 569. Accordingly, if the new guidelines had been in effect when Russell was sentenced, his guideline sentencing range would have been 188 to 235 months. <i>See</i> U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2D1.1(c) (Drug Quantity Table) (Supp.2008); <i>id.</i> ch. 5, pt. A (Sentencing Table)(Offense level 31, CHC VI). His 180-month sentence thus falls below the revised guidelines for his offense.</p>\n<p>[6]  The government also argues that any procedural error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it is unlikely that the district court would impose a lower sentence if the case were remanded. Because we conclude that there was no error, we need not address the government's harmless error analysis. Also, the plain error analysis we applied in our recent decision in <i>United States v. Matos,</i> 531 F.3d 121, 2008 WL 2687385 (1st Cir. July 10, 2008), is inapplicable. There the <i>Kimbrough</i> issue was not preserved. More importantly, as we explain, here there was no <i>Kimbrough</i> error at all by the sentencing judge.</p>\n<p>[7]  The Supreme Court vacated our decision in <i>Pho,</i> along with the decisions of other circuits that the Supreme Court deemed incompatible with <i>Kimbrough.</i> We obviously accept that decision. We remanded <i>Pho</i> to the district court for resentencing in light of the Supreme Court's decision. However, our fidelity to the decisions of the Supreme Court does not preclude us from expressing reservations about the Supreme Court's characterization of one of our decisions.</p>\n<p>[8]  If the government had filed an information under 21 U.S.C. § 851 stating a prior drug felony conviction, Russell would have been subject to an increased statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A), 851(a).</p>\n\n</div>",

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005). The defendant, Antron Russell, has already been sentenced three times following his guilty plea on a charge of distributing crack cocaine. Prior to the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Booker,</i> Russell was sentenced to 235 months of imprisonment, the bottom of the applicable guideline range. After we remanded for resentencing in light of <i>Booker,</i> he was sentenced to 151 months, a downward variance based upon a 20:1 ratio that the district court substituted for the 100:1 ratio under the then-applicable guideline regime for offenses involving crack as opposed to powder cocaine. We subsequently rejected the calculation of variances based upon \"the categorical substitution of a 20:1 crack-to-powder ratio for the 100:1 ratio embedded in the sentencing guidelines\" in <i>United States v. Pho,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202000\"><a href=\"/opinion/202000/united-states-v-pho/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span>, 64 (1st Cir.2006). Accordingly, Russell's sentence was vacated. Upon remand, he was sentenced to 180 months.</p>\n<p>Russell now appeals that sentence, contending that it is not reasonable. While his appeal was pending before us, the Supreme Court decided <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145841\"><a href=\"/opinion/145841/kimbrough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span> (2007), holding that \"it would not be an abuse of discretion for a district court to conclude when sentencing a particular defendant that the crack/powder disparity yields a sentence `greater than necessary' to achieve § 3553(a)'s purposes, even in a mine-run case.\" <i>Id.</i> at 575. Russell seeks to parlay <i>Kimbrough</i> into a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> fourth sentencing. Because we conclude that the district court anticipated the holding in <i>Kimbrough,</i> considered the crack/powder disparity as part of its individualized § 3553(a) analysis at the most recent sentencing, and imposed a reasonable sentence, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Russell was charged with possession with intent to distribute cocaine base in excess of fifty grams, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and (b)(1)(A).<sup>[1]</sup> He entered a guilty plea pursuant to a plea agreement, stipulating that the quantity of cocaine base involved in the offense and related conduct totaled 233.74 grams. In exchange, the government agreed to recommend the lowest prison term within the applicable guideline range, advocate for either a two- or three-level decrease for acceptance of responsibility, and refrain from filing for a sentence enhancement under 21 U.S.C. § 851 and seeking an official victim enhancement under § 3A1.2 of the sentencing guidelines.</p>\n<p>At the plea colloquy, the government reviewed the factual basis for the plea. On March 8, 2003, local police learned that a man fitting Russell's description was planning to sell crack at a McDonald's restaurant in Cranston, Rhode Island. At the scheduled time, Russell arrived at the McDonald's parking lot in a car driven by a woman. Police officers approached both sides of the car and removed the driver. As this was happening, Russell reached over from the passenger seat and drove the car forward and backward in an attempt to escape. Three officers were struck by the car, and the police ultimately opened fire on the car to stop it. Russell was carrying 141.24 grams of crack cocaine in his pocket. At the colloquy, Russell also admitted to selling additional quantities of crack cocaine, totaling 92.5 grams, to undercover officers on three prior occasions in late 2002 and early 2003.</p>\n<p>At the first sentencing hearing, held on August 27, 2004, the district court calculated Russell's applicable guideline sentencing range.<sup>[2]</sup> Based on the stipulated drug quantities, Russell's base offense level was set at 34. The court found that a three-level reduction for timely acceptance of responsibility and a two-level victim-related enhancement for reckless endangerment, pursuant to § 3C1.2, were appropriate, yielding a total offense level of 33. Russell's 13 criminal history points placed him in Criminal History Category (\"CHC\") VI, producing a guideline sentencing range of 235 to 293 months.</p>\n<p>Russell objected to the two-level enhancement for reckless endangerment on the ground that, in light of <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span> (2004), the government had not met its burden of proving the facts predicate to the two-level enhancement beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>Id.</i> at 303, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2531</span></a></span>. The court rejected this view, stating that there was no <i>Blakely</i> issue because \"in the plea colloquy the Government outlined all of the facts that are alleged to support this enhancement\" and Russell had agreed to that outline. The court imposed a 235-month sentence, the lowest sentence available within the guideline range.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> Russell appealed his first sentence based on the <i>Blakely</i> issue. However, while the appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided <i>Booker</i> and the government conceded that a remand was required for resentencing under an advisory guideline regime. We accepted that concession and remanded.</p>\n<p>In his written submissions and at the second sentencing hearing, held on October 28, 2005, Russell asked the court to impose a 120-month sentence  the applicable mandatory minimum. Russell asserted that a 120-month sentence would better serve the interest of rehabilitation than the much longer guideline sentence. He also claimed that his criminal history score was overstated and argued that the 100:1 ratio for crack versus powder cocaine embedded within the sentencing guidelines was unjust. The government countered by highlighting Russell's long list of adult arrests and convictions and noting that the three short prison sentences he had served previously had not deterred his criminal conduct. The government also contended that \"it should be left to Congress, not the Courts, to modify or even abrogate in its entirety the sentencing distinctions between crack cocaine and powder cocaine,\" and noted that if different district courts used different ratios to calculate post-<i>Booker</i> sentences for crack cocaine, substantial sentencing disparities would arise. The government advocated for the reimposition of a 235-month sentence.</p>\n<p>The district court stated its categorical disagreement with the 100:1 ratio in the sentencing guidelines. The court stated that a 20:1 ratio, which would have produced a 151- to 188-month guideline range in Russell's case, should be used to guide the application of the advisory guidelines. The court then considered the § 3553 factors and imposed a sentence of 151 months.</p>\n<p>Russell appealed this sentence, arguing that it was unreasonable even though it was substantially below the applicable guideline sentencing range. The government cross-appealed, arguing that the district court's categorical rejection of the 100:1 ratio violated our holding in <i>United States v. Pho,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202000\"><a href=\"/opinion/202000/united-states-v-pho/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2006)  a case decided about two months after Russell's second sentence was imposed. We remanded for resentencing in light of <i>Pho</i> without addressing the reasonableness of the sentence.</p>\n<p>Russell filed a motion to continue his third sentencing pending the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Claiborne v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">551</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></span> (2006),<sup>[4]</sup> and the final approval of amendments proposed by the Sentencing Commission to the guidelines applicable to crack cocaine offenses.<sup>[5]</sup> The court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> denied the continuance, and then explained at the third sentencing hearing on May 10, 2007, that it had concluded that a continuance was unnecessary because it has substantial discretion to vary from the guideline sentence, notwithstanding our rejection of categorical ratio substitutions in <i>Pho.</i> The court also concluded that it could take into account the proposed crack cocaine guideline amendments in considering the overall reasonableness of Russell's sentence. However, the court explained that it had \"undervalued\" several aggravating factors at the previous sentencing. The court particularly noted the large amount of crack cocaine involved and Russell's violent escape attempt, which had forced officers to fire their weapons in a busy McDonald's parking lot, where children might have been endangered. The court imposed a 180-month sentence.</p>\n<p>Russell then filed this appeal, claiming that his sentence was unreasonable. While the appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided <i>Kimbrough.</i> Russell argues that the <i>Kimbrough</i> decision further supports his contention that his 180-month sentence was unreasonably high. The government counters by asserting that the district court anticipated the holding in <i>Kimbrough</i> and properly considered all of the relevant factors in making the individualized determination called for by § 3553(a).<sup>[6]</sup> We agree.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>\"We review the substantive reasonableness of a sentence for abuse of discretion, but we first consider whether the court below committed a `significant procedural error, such as ... treating the Guidelines as mandatory.'\" <i>United States v. DeCologero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203344\"><a href=\"/opinion/203344/united-states-v-decologero/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 70 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting <i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (2007)). Accordingly, we turn first to Russell's contention that the district court committed a procedural error by failing to consider the crack/powder cocaine disparity as explicitly permitted now by <i>Kimbrough.</i></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Pho</i> and <i>Kimbrough</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In <i>Pho,</i> we held that \"the district court erred as a matter of law when it constructed a new sentencing range based on the categorical substitution of a 20:1 crack-to-powder ratio for a 100:1 ratio embedded in the sentencing guidelines.\" 433 F.3d at 64. We explained that \"sentencing decisions must be done case by case and must be grounded in case-specific considerations, not in general disagreement with broad-based policies enunciated by Congress or the [Sentencing] Commission.\" <i>Id.</i> at 64-65. Our holding was thus limited to a rejection of a categorical, policy-based ratio substitution. We cautioned that \"we [did] not intend to diminish the discretion that, after <i>Booker,</i> district courts enjoy in sentencing matters or to suggest that, in a drug-trafficking case, the nature of the contraband and/or the severity of a projected guideline sentence may not be taken <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> into account on a case-by-case basis.\" <i>Id.</i> at 65.</p>\n<p>In <i>Kimbrough,</i> the Supreme Court reversed a Fourth Circuit decision that had taken a far more restrictive approach than we had in <i>Pho.</i> The Fourth Circuit had held that \"a sentence `outside the guidelines range is per se unreasonable when it is based on a disagreement with the sentencing disparity for crack and powder cocaine offenses.'\" <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 565 (quoting <i>United States v. Kimbrough,</i> 174 Fed.Appx. 798, 799 (4th Cir. 2006) (per curiam)). The Supreme Court rejected the Fourth Circuit's approach because it made \"the crack/powder disparity effectively mandatory.\" <i>Id.</i> at 564. The Court held instead that a sentencing judge \"may determine ... that, in a particular case, a within-Guidelines sentence is `greater than necessary' to serve the objectives of sentencing,\" as set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a), and that \"[i]n making that determination, the judge may consider the disparity between the Guidelines' treatment of crack and powder cocaine offenses.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Although the <i>Kimbrough</i> Court listed <i>Pho</i> as one of the circuit court decisions that had taken the view that a \"sentencing court may not impose a sentence outside the Guidelines range based on its disagreement with the crack/powder disparity,\" <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 566 n. 4, we respectfully question that assessment.<sup>[7]</sup> Indeed, there has been widespread misunderstanding of <i>Pho</i> in this circuit. We rejected in <i>Pho</i> the categorical substitution by the sentencing judge of a lower ratio  effectively, a constructive guideline sentencing range  for all crack cocaine offenders. However, we expressly preserved the discretion of the sentencing judge to consider the \"nature of the contraband and/or the severity of a projected guideline sentence ... on a case-by-case basis.\" <i>Pho,</i> 433 F.3d at 65. This case-by-case, individualized analysis is precisely the approach endorsed by the Supreme Court in <i>Kimbrough.</i> In detailing the method used by the sentencing court in <i>Kimbrough,</i> the Court approvingly noted that \"the [sentencing] court did not purport to establish a ratio of its own. Rather it appropriately framed its final determination in line with § 3553(a)'s overarching instruction to `impose a sentence sufficient, but not greater than necessary' to accomplish the sentencing goals advanced in § 3553(a)(2).\" 128 S.Ct. at 575. Thus, at its core, <i>Pho</i> is actually consistent with <i>Kimbrough:</i> both decisions emphasize the importance of individualized, case-by-case sentencing determinations, rather than a reliance on generalized ratios.</p>\n<p>As we recently explained, \"the <i>Kimbrough</i> Court's organic reading of section 3553(a) suggests that a sentencing judge should engage in a ... holistic inquiry,\" by considering \"a tapestry of factors, through which runs the thread of [the] overarching principle\" of parsimony. <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203311\"><a href=\"/opinion/203311/united-states-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span>, 228 (1st Cir. 2008). After <i>Kimbrough,</i> it is clear that the undue harshness that may result from the 100:1 crack/powder ratio is properly considered as one of those factors woven into the tapestry as the district court considers what sentence is \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" in each individual case.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> B. Russell's Third Sentencing Hearing</h2>\n<p>The question, then, is whether the district court avoided procedural error at Russell's third sentencing hearing by properly considering all of the relevant factors  including the crack/powder disparity  in making its § 3553(a) determination that a 180-month sentence was \"sufficient, but not greater than necessary\" in this particular case. Our review of the transcript reveals no error.</p>\n<p>At the hearing, the district court began by addressing its rationale for denying Russell's motion for a continuance, explaining that <i>Pho</i> did not substantially constrain its discretion:</p>\n<blockquote>So the reason that I really felt that, on that ground, that I wasn't inclined to grant the motion is that I feel that we have a substantial discretion to impose a non-guideline sentence, and what <i>Pho</i> said really was that district courts should not get into the business of defining a, sort of a uniform or across-the-board policy basis with respect to those kinds of sentences, but rather should be doing them on a case-by-case basis, but sort of left open, I think very clearly left open [to] the discretion of the district court to formulate a sentence that is whatever the Court feels is a reasonable sentence.</blockquote>\n<p>This view of <i>Pho</i> is, as we noted above, consistent with the Supreme Court's later holding in <i>Kimbrough.</i> Indeed, we think that the district court here presciently anticipated the guidance that the Court would provide in <i>Kimbrough.</i> Later in the hearing, the court stated:</p>\n<blockquote>[W]e have been told by the Court of Appeals that the application of a rigid 20-to-1 ratio was error and that that's not the way to go about doing these sentences. And I think I've said before, and sort of reflecting on this over the last few years, I think the Court of Appeals was probably right about that. And as to the policy part of it, I think that our job is to look at these cases on a real case-by-case basis and try to come up with a sentence that is appropriate.</blockquote>\n<p>The court clearly  and correctly  believed that it had the authority to consider the crack/powder disparity as one factor in that case-by-case analysis. Referencing the proposed amendments to the crack sentencing guidelines, the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>The history of these amendments is that Congress has rejected them, although there's some reason to believe they would accept this one. But, again, as I'm looking at it, I'm inclined to think that you can argue, I suppose, that this is further evidence that the guideline range in this case is not reasonable. And you might have a lot of arguments that sort of fit into that  a number of arguments that you would make in order to say it's not reasonable, including various statements of the Sentencing Commission about crack cocaine sentences over the last few years, and this would just be an additional item to support that argument.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>From my point of view, I feel that I've got the discretion to put all of that into the basket and try to figure out what a reasonable sentence is under the advisory guideline system.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>So once again, I'm not sure I need to see that amendment either be adopted or not be adopted in order to figure out, from my point of view, what I think a reasonable sentence is.</blockquote>\n<p>The court concluded that a reasonable sentence for Russell was 180 months, 29 months <i>longer</i> than the 151-month sentence that the court had imposed at the second sentencing but still well below the bottom of Russell's guideline sentencing range.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> Given the court's understanding of the discretion it retained after <i>Pho</i> in fashioning an individualized sentence, Russell's contention that the constraints of <i>Pho</i> produced the longer sentence at his third sentencing is untenable. Rather, the court explained that it had \"undervalued\" other factors at Russell's second sentencing. The court described being \"struck\" by three factors in reviewing the case:</p>\n<blockquote>One is that I think the quantity of cocaine here was pretty substantial. And there were several transactions, not just one. The amount of money involved was substantial, and I think these facts pointed to your role as a dealer as somewhat more substantial than other defendants that I've seen....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>The second thing that struck me is that the Government did not file an 851 enhancement<sup>[8]</sup> in this case, which it certainly could have....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>And then the third thing that struck me was that, in rereading the facts of the case, was the attempt to escape and the fact that three officers were hit by the car, the fact that this all occurred at a McDonald's restaurant, a busy place. There could have been children running around. And I think that's a disturbing fact, even perhaps more disturbing is the fact that the police officers had to fire their weapons in response to the attempt to escape.</blockquote>\n<p>These three factors led the court to conclude that \"a somewhat greater sentence than what [it had] previously imposed is appropriate.\" Thus, the record of Russell's third sentencing hearing reveals that the district court considered the crack/cocaine disparity as well as a host of other individualized factors in reaching a holistic assessment of the sentence called for by § 3553. We perceive no procedural error.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Substantive Reasonableness</h2>\n<p>Having satisfied ourselves that the sentence is procedurally sound, we proceed \"to review the substantive reasonableness of the sentence, taking into account the totality of the circumstances ... [and giving] `due deference to the district court's decision that the § 3553(a) factors, on a whole, justify the extent of the variance.'\" <i>United States v. Martin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203196\"><a href=\"/opinion/203196/united-states-v-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 92 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Gall,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 597).</p>\n<p>Russell points to two factors that he contends should have driven his sentence even lower. First, he argues that the district court did not adequately consider the crack/powder disparity in arriving at his sentence. However, we have no reason to question the adequacy of the size of the downward departure the district court granted on the basis of the disparity here. The record of all three sentencing hearings, read together, suggests that there were no other substantial mitigating factors that could explain the significant downward variance here. At the second sentencing hearing, the only factor the court discussed that would lead to a below-guideline sentence was the crack/powder disparity. Similarly, at the third sentencing hearing, the only mitigating factors specifically referenced by the court were the history of proposed amendments to the crack/powder ratio in the guidelines and the \"yo-yo effect with respect to sentencing\" that Russell had had to endure as a result of the several remands in the case. Thus, it appears that the crack/powder disparity accounts for the bulk of the fifty-five-month <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> downward variance in Russell's sentence.</p>\n<p>Second, Russell contends that the district court failed to adequately account for his personal circumstances in the third sentencing. He describes those personal circumstances as having \"limited education and employment opportunities, marijuana and alcohol addictions, and a young child.\" We fail to see how this vague description places Russell so far from \"the mine-run of criminal defendants,\" <i>see </i><i>Martin,</i> 520 F.3d at 95, as to <i>require</i> the district court to impose a sentence even farther below the guideline range than the 180-month sentence it imposed. Russell's arguments fall far short of undermining the substantive reasonableness of his sentence.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  At the plea colloquy, the government characterized the drugs as \"cocaine base or crack cocaine\" and used these two terms interchangeably.</p>\n<p>[2]  These guideline calculations have remained consistent throughout the three sentencing hearings in this case.</p>\n<p>[3]  The court also sentenced Russell to five years of supervised release, with special conditions requiring that he seek full-time employment and participate in a substance abuse program. These conditions remained consistent through each of the three sentencings and Russell has not challenged them here.</p>\n<p>[4]  <i>Claiborne</i> was vacated as moot when the defendant died. ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145723\"><a href=\"/opinion/145723/claiborne-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2245</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145723\"><a href=\"/opinion/145723/claiborne-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1080</span></a></span> (2007) (per curiam). The issues raised in the case were then decided in <i>Gall v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">586</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145843\"><a href=\"/opinion/145843/gall-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">445</span></a></span> (2007). The Court held that appellate courts in reviewing a non-guideline sentence may \"take the degree of variance into account,\" but the Court rejected \"an appellate rule that requires `extraordinary' circumstances to justify a sentence outside the Guidelines.\" <i>Id.</i> at 595.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Sentencing Commission's alteration to the guidelines became effective on November 1, 2007, reducing the base offense level associated with each quantity of crack by two levels. <i>Kimbrough,</i> 128 S.Ct. at 569. Accordingly, if the new guidelines had been in effect when Russell was sentenced, his guideline sentencing range would have been 188 to 235 months. <i>See</i> U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual § 2D1.1(c) (Drug Quantity Table) (Supp.2008); <i>id.</i> ch. 5, pt. A (Sentencing Table)(Offense level 31, CHC VI). His 180-month sentence thus falls below the revised guidelines for his offense.</p>\n<p>[6]  The government also argues that any procedural error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because it is unlikely that the district court would impose a lower sentence if the case were remanded. Because we conclude that there was no error, we need not address the government's harmless error analysis. Also, the plain error analysis we applied in our recent decision in <i>United States v. Matos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203383\"><a href=\"/opinion/203383/united-states-v-matos/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">121</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2687385</span></span> (1st Cir. July 10, 2008), is inapplicable. There the <i>Kimbrough</i> issue was not preserved. More importantly, as we explain, here there was no <i>Kimbrough</i> error at all by the sentencing judge.</p>\n<p>[7]  The Supreme Court vacated our decision in <i>Pho,</i> along with the decisions of other circuits that the Supreme Court deemed incompatible with <i>Kimbrough.</i> We obviously accept that decision. We remanded <i>Pho</i> to the district court for resentencing in light of the Supreme Court's decision. However, our fidelity to the decisions of the Supreme Court does not preclude us from expressing reservations about the Supreme Court's characterization of one of our decisions.</p>\n<p>[8]  If the government had filed an information under 21 U.S.C. § 851 stating a prior drug felony conviction, Russell would have been subject to an increased statutory mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(b)(1)(A), 851(a).</p>\n\n</div>",
