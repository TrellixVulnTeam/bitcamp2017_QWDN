López-Rivera.\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Second Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          Zaira Z. Girón Anadón, Assistant Solicitor General, with\nwhom Ileana M. Oliver Falero, Acting Deputy Solicitor General, and\nMaite Oronoz-Rodríguez, Acting Solicitor General, were on the brief\nfor Rosario, et al.\n\n\n\n\n                          July 17, 2009\n\f            Per Curiam.   Plaintiff Raúl Marrero-Colon appeals from\n\nthe judgments of the United States District Court for the District\n\nof Puerto Rico, dismissing Plaintiff’s case. Plaintiff brought the\n\nsuit against his employer, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority\n\n(“PREPA”), and individual defendants Héctor Rosario, Ramón L.\n\nRodríguez-Meléndez, Ana T. Blanes-Rodríguez, Ramón Collazo-Santini,\n\nLuis   A.   Vázquez-García,   and   Miguel   A.   López-Rivera,   who   are\n\nadministrators and supervisors at PREPA, who were sued in both\n\ntheir personal and official capacities.\n\n            Plaintiff is a member of Puerto Rico’s New Progressive\n\nParty (“NPP”).    His suit alleged discrimination against him in his\n\nemployment resulting from the preference of various PREPA officials\n\nfor Puerto Rico’s Popular Democratic Party (“PDP”).               The suit\n\nasserted a host of claims under the First, Fifth, and Fourteenth\n\nAmendments, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983, 1985, 1986, and 1988, the Uniformed\n\nServices Employment and Re-employment Rights Act (38 U.S.C. § 4301\n\net seq.), the Veterans Preference Act (5 U.S.C. § 3501 et seq.), 42\n\nU.S.C. § 2000e-3(a), and the Fair Labor and Standards Act (29\n\nU.S.C. §§ 215(a)(3) and 216).        He also raised various local law\n\nclaims.\n\n            The district court dismissed all of the federal claims on\n\nthe pleadings, except for the discrimination and retaliation claims\n\nbrought under § 1983 against López-Rivera and Vázquez-García.           The\n\ncourt granted Defendants’ motion for summary judgment dismissing\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fthe remaining federal claims. The court dismissed the supplemental\n\nstate law claims without prejudice.            We conclude that the district\n\ncourt properly dismissed many claims as time-barred and properly\n\ngranted   summary       judgment   on   the     §   1983    discrimination     and\n\nretaliation   claims.        Finding    no    merit   in   any    of   Plaintiff’s\n\nmultitudinous arguments, we AFFIRM the judgment.\n\n                                   DISCUSSION\n\n           The    complaint     alleged       numerous     instances    in   which\n\nPlaintiff failed to receive a promotion or some other benefit.                  We\n\ndiscuss only some of his numerous claims on appeal, finding the\n\nothers too insubstantial to warrant discussion.\n\n           Many    of    Plaintiff’s     claims     alleged      unconstitutional\n\ndiscrimination under § 1983 and were dismissed as untimely.                  State\n\nlaw governs the statute of limitations for claims brought under §\n\n1983.   Rivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 352-53 (1st\n\nCir. 1992).   In Puerto Rico, one must bring a claim under 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1983 within one year of the time the cause of action accrues.\n\nId. at 353.      Plaintiff filed his complaint on October 14, 2004.\n\nTherefore, under this general rule, any claims brought under § 1983\n\nwhich accrued prior to October 14, 2003 are barred by the statute\n\nof   limitations.         The   vast     majority     of    the    instances    of\n\ndiscrimination alleged in Plaintiff’s complaint accrued prior to\n\nOctober 14, 2003, and thus they are time-barred.                        They were\n\ncorrectly dismissed by the district court.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f              The    complaint        alleges     only        two     instances       of\n\ndiscrimination which are not time-barred.                The first instance was\n\nPlaintiff’s promotion on October 26, 2003 to a permanent position\n\nof Line Supervisor II, which Plaintiff contends was inferior to\n\nother   similarly     classified       positions       held   by     PDP   members    in\n\n“responsibilities, work to be done, opportunity to work overtime\n\nhours, [and] persons supervised, among other things.”\n\n              The second instance was the conversion in 2004 of a Line\n\nSupervisor III position into a Supervisor Engineer II position,\n\nwhich Plaintiff claimed was done in order to justify awarding the\n\nposition to a PDP sympathizer, Engineer Martin Wah, rather than to\n\nhim.      Plaintiff        alleges    that     these    actions       taken   by     his\n\nsupervisors, who were PDP members or sympathizers, were motivated\n\nby discriminatory animus against him by reason of his membership in\n\nthe    NPP,   as    well    as   in   retaliation       for    his    complaints     of\n\ndiscrimination.\n\n              In order to establish a case of political discrimination\n\nor retaliation under the First Amendment, a plaintiff must not only\n\nshow that he or she engaged in conduct which was constitutionally\n\nprotected, but also that in making the adverse employment decision\n\nagainst him, the defendants were substantially motivated by the\n\nplaintiff’s protected activity or status. Powell v. Alexander, 391\n\nF.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 2004).           If the defendants, moving for summary\n\njudgment, show entitlement to judgment by evidence that they were\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fnot motivated by the illegal considerations alleged, the plaintiff\n\nmust offer evidence capable of rebutting the defendants’ showing,\n\ndemonstrating that there is a material issue of fact in dispute.\n\nId.    “[U]nsupported and speculative assertions regarding political\n\ndiscrimination will not be enough to survive summary judgment.”\n\nRivera-Cotto v. Rivera, 38 F.3d 611, 614 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n              As for Plaintiff’s promotion to the position of Line\n\nSupervisor II in 2003, Plaintiff failed to point to any evidence\n\nshowing that this action was an adverse employment decision. Apart\n\nfrom conclusory characterizations, he showed no evidence which\n\nwould demonstrate that he was treated in a manner inferior to PDP\n\nsympathizers or that the responsibilities given his position were\n\ninferior to those of similarly classified PDP sympathizers.              While\n\nPlaintiff submitted time-sheets for two PDP sympathizers, one of\n\nwhom Plaintiff alleged had superior work responsibilities and\n\nbenefits for the same position that Plaintiff occupied, Plaintiff\n\nsubmitted no time-sheets or other evidence of his own work which\n\nwould provide a basis for such comparison.             He failed to raise an\n\nissue of material fact.\n\n              As to the 2004 reclassification, Defendants submitted\n\nevidence that the Line Supervisor III position was reclassified in\n\norder to recruit a needed engineer to the district of Barranquitas.\n\nPlaintiff did not point to any evidence in the record which could\n\nshow   that    this   reclassification    was   done    for   the   purpose   of\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fdiscrimination.      Indeed,   Plaintiff    provided    no     references   to\n\nevidence   even   indicating   that   Wah   was   a   member    of   the   PDP.\n\nPlaintiff failed to put forth any evidence capable of rebutting\n\nDefendants’ showing.\n\n           We have reviewed Plaintiff’s other contentions and find\n\nthem to be without merit.      The district court did not err in its\n\nrulings in favor of Defendants.\n\n              Judgment AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f",
