Manuel Cardona-Martínez and\n\nCarmen Márquez Parrilla bring this appeal challenging the judgment\n\nentered   in   favor   of   the   defendants    below     in   this    political\n\ndiscrimination case.        Cardona and Márquez are members of the New\n\nProgressive Party (NPP), which was until November 2000 the ruling\n\nparty in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.                  In 2000, the NPP\n\nadministration was ousted when the Popular Democratic Party (PDP)\n\nwon the November gubernatorial election. With the resultant change\n\nin the Puerto Rican administration in January 2001 came a rotation\n\nof the membership of the managerial echelon at various executive\n\nagencies.   Like a spate of others decided in the course of the past\n\nfew years, this case arises out of that shake-up.                     See, e.g.,\n\nRodríguez-Marín v. Rivera-Gonzalez, 438 F.3d 72 (1st Cir. 2006);\n\nBorges    Colón   v.   Román-Abreu,    438     F.3d   1   (1st   Cir.     2006);\n\nVélez-Rivera v. Agosto-Alicea, 437 F.3d 145 (1st Cir. 2006);\n\nRosario-Urdaz v. Velazco, 433 F.3d 174 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n            Cardona and Márquez allege that they were demoted and\n\nsuffered other professional indignities after the change of regime,\n\nand brought these political discrimination claims under the First\n\nand Fourteenth Amendments. The district court rendered judgment as\n\na matter of law after the close of the plaintiffs' case-in-chief,\n\nfinding, inter alia, that the plaintiffs could not prove unlawful\n\npolitical discrimination because the positions from which they were\n\nremoved were political positions.           We affirm.\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f                                I.\n\n          Appellants here were, both before and after the 2000\n\nelections, employees of the Regulations and Permits Administration,\n\nknown by its Spanish acronym, ARPE.1       The Puerto Rican career\n\nservice recognizes two relevant categories of employees at state\n\nagencies like the ARPE: those who hold positions of trust and\n\nconfidence, who are generally in the style of policy-makers and\n\nadvisers and who are political appointees, see 3 P.R. Laws Ann. §\n\n1350 (2000); and those who hold career positions, see id. § 1352,\n\nwho make up the bulk of the remainder of the public sector.      In\n\nhiring the former, a potential employee's political affiliation is\n\ntypically a vital consideration, while as to the latter, Puerto\n\nRican law dictates that political affiliation is neither a relevant\n\nnor a permissible consideration.     See id. § 1333.\n\n          Cardona and Márquez have each held both trust and career\n\npositions, but for a significant period prior to the election, each\n\nheld a trust position.    Puerto Rican law gives departing trust\n\nemployees who came out of the career service the right to reclaim\n\na career position equivalent to the career position they last held.\n\nSee id. § 1350(8)(a); see also Rosario-Urdaz, 433 F.3d at 176.   Our\n\ncases have noted other instances in which trust employees have made\n\n\n\n     1\n      This appeal was brought after the district court granted\njudgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants, and so we\nrecite the facts as presented by the plaintiffs, drawing any\ninferences in their favor.\n\n                               -3-\n\fsuch a move prior to an election in which an opposing party may\n\nwin, and made it at the latest date possible before the election.\n\nSee, e.g., Rodriguez-Marin, 438 F.3d at 75; Velez-Rivera, 437 F.3d\n\nat 149.   Puerto Rico has imposed a moratorium on such shifts during\n\nthe two months prior to and the two months after an election, see\n\n3 P.R. Laws Ann. § 1337, which means that these shifts into career\n\npositions tend to take place in August or early September before a\n\nNovember election.      Accordingly, in August 2000, as the elections\n\napproached,    both   Cardona   and   Márquez   moved   from   their   trust\n\npositions into career positions.\n\n             Each briefly took a significant pay cut and reduction in\n\nassigned duties.      Crucial to this case, however, both were quickly\n\npromoted to positions designated as career posts but carrying\n\nsalaries commensurate with their old trust-position salaries.\n\n             In November 2000, the PDP won the Commonwealth-wide\n\ngubernatorial election, and in January 2001, the new administration\n\ntook over.    Roughly one year later, toward the end of January 2002,\n\nappellants both received letters signed by the new (PDP-affiliated)\n\nadministrator of their division of the ARPE removing them to new\n\npositions. Each was given a brief informal hearing on the question\n\nof his or her reassignment.       Cardona was moved from his recently\n\nacquired position as a class-II Administrative Facilitator, with a\n\n$4,000 monthly salary, to a statistician's job with a salary closer\n\nto $1,700.     Márquez received a similar letter, informing her that\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fshe would lose her position as Manager of Services and Process,\n\nwith its monthly salary of $4,300, and would resume work as an\n\nInternal Service Representative at a monthly rate of $2,500.\n\n               The appellants brought suit in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and\n\nthe First and Fourteenth Amendments, alleging that their demotions\n\nand reductions of pay and perquisites were unconstitutional because\n\nmotivated by political animosity.2        Named as defendants are various\n\nmembers of the new cadre of trust employees appointed to run the\n\nARPE.       The case went to trial on January 29, 2004, and plaintiffs\n\nconcluded presentation of their case-in-chief on February 12, 2004.\n\nThe defendants subsequently moved for judgment as a matter of law\n\nunder Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.               The\n\ndistrict court granted the defendants' motion.\n\n               The district court opinion granted judgment on the basis\n\nof three interrelated conclusions.        The first was that Cardona and\n\nMárquez held their most recent positions illegitimately; the second\n\nwas that the positions they held, while designated as \"career\"\n\npositions for purposes of the Puerto Rican career service, were\n\nnevertheless in fact the type of politically sensitive positions\n\nthat the First Amendment permits to be filled on the basis of\n\n\n\n        2\n      Márquez also stated a First Amendment claim arising out of an\nincident in which she was reprimanded after speaking critically\nabout the new administration on the radio, but on appeal does not\npress any issues related to that claim.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fpolitical affiliation; and the third was that the plaintiffs had\n\nnot put forward evidence of discriminatory intent on the part of\n\nthe defendants.        The court ruled that the state's interest in\n\nfilling the vacated positions with supporters of the incoming\n\nparty's policies, taken together with the weakness of the evidence\n\npresented at trial of any politically discriminatory motive on the\n\npart of the defendants, meant that \"a reasonable jury could not\n\nconclude that Plaintiffs have met their burden establishing a cause\n\nof action for political discrimination in violation of the First\n\nAmendment of the United States Constitution pursuant to 42 U.S.C.\n\nSection 1983.\"     Cardona and Márquez timely appealed.\n\n                                     II.\n\n             Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) permits a party to\n\nmove for judgment as a matter of law before the case has been\n\nsubmitted to the jury.       In deciding a Rule 50 motion, a district\n\ncourt \"must examine the evidence, and inferences to be drawn\n\ntherefrom, in the light most favorable to the non-movant.\"             Mangla\n\nv.   Brown    Univ.,   135   F.3d   80,    82   (1st   Cir.   1998)   (citing\n\nRolón-Alvarado v. Municipality of San Juan, 1 F.3d 74, 76 (1st Cir.\n\n1993)).      Judgment as a matter of law may be granted when a party\n\nhas been fully heard on an issue and has presented \"no legally\n\nsufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that\n\nparty on that issue . . . .\"        Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a)(1); see also\n\nMangla, 135 F.3d at 82 (judgment as a matter of law may be granted\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f\"only if the evidence, viewed from this perspective, is such that\n\nreasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome\" (quoting\n\nRolón-Alvarado, 1 F.3d at 77)).       We review the disposition of the\n\nmotion de novo, applying the same standard.       Mangla, 135 F.3d at\n\n82.\n\n            On appeal, plaintiffs have challenged two of the district\n\ncourt's three determinations.         The first challenge is to the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that the promotion of Cardona and\n\nMárquez to higher level positions in the career service within days\n\nof their transfers from trust to career positions was illegitimate.\n\nThe second challenge is to the district court's conclusion that no\n\nevidence of political discrimination had been adduced.                Left\n\nunchallenged, however, is the district court's determination that\n\nthe positions to which Cardona and Márquez were promoted were\n\n(despite being designated \"career positions\" by the Puerto Rican\n\ncareer    service)   policymaking   positions.3   The   import   of   that\n\nconclusion appears to have eluded appellants' counsel, and the\n\nfailure to challenge the determination is fatal to appellants'\n\nclaims.    While the general rule is that the dismissal of a public\n\n\n      3\n      There may be a passing gesture at the point in the brief, but\nif so, it is insufficient to alert us to any error in the district\njudge's determination.    \"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory\nmanner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation,\nare deemed waived.\" United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\nCir. 1990).    Appellants have not indicated, for example, what\nduties they had in the career positions from which they were\nejected, and without that information, we are in no position to\nreview the determination of the district judge.\n\n                                    -7-\n\femployee on the basis of the employee's political affiliation\n\n\"infringes First Amendment freedoms of belief and association,\"\n\nJimenez Fuentes v. Torres Gaztambide, 807 F.2d 236, 239 (1st Cir.\n\n1986) (en banc), a vital exception to the rule is that politically\n\nmotivated     dismissals     of     public      employees     holding     certain\n\npolitically sensitive positions are both permissible and necessary\n\nin a system of representative democracy. See id. (quoting Elrod v.\n\nBurns, 427 U.S. 347, 367 (1976)).          The question a court must ask in\n\ndeciding whether a post may be filled on the basis of political\n\naffiliation    is     whether     such   affiliation    \"is    an    appropriate\n\nrequirement for the effective performance of the public office\n\ninvolved.\"    Id. at 240 (quoting Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507, 518\n\n(1980)).     Although the designation of a position as a trust or\n\ncareer post under the Puerto Rican career service regime is a\n\nfactor     relevant    to   the     determination      whether      the   federal\n\nconstitution permits political affiliation to be taken into account\n\nin making hiring and firing decisions with respect to the position,\n\nit is not determinative.          Id. at 246.\n\n            Here, the district court concluded that the stipulated\n\nand uncontested facts indicated that the job positions to which the\n\nappellants were promoted just before the election were political\n\npositions, and that denying the incoming administration the power\n\nto fill the positions with members of it own party would frustrate\n\nthe efforts of the victors of the recent election to carry out the\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\fpolicy initiatives that it was their duty and mandate to implement.\n\nWe need take no view as to whether this was in fact a correct\n\nconclusion on the evidence presented at trial.       By failing to make\n\nthe   argument   that   the   district   court   erred   on   this   point,\n\nappellants have waived it and have effectively conceded the point.\n\nSee King v. Town of Hanover, 116 F.3d 965, 970 (1st Cir. 1997); see\n\nalso Pomerleau v. W. Springfield Pub. Sch., 362 F.3d 143, 147 n.3\n\n(1st Cir. 2004). The conceded point is dispositive of this appeal:\n\nthe appellants are bound by the district court's unchallenged\n\nconclusion that the First Amendment did not bar the defendants from\n\nremoving them from their positions on the basis of their political\n\naffiliation, and so the district court's grant of judgment as a\n\nmatter of law must stand.\n\n                                  III.\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, the entry of judgment by the\n\ndistrict court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f",

Judgment as a matter of law may be granted when a party has been fully heard on an issue and has presented \"no legally sufficient evidentiary basis for a reasonable jury to find for that party on that issue....\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 50(a)(1); <i>see also Mangla,</i> 135 F.3d at 82 (judgment as a matter of law may be granted \"only if the evidence, viewed from this perspective, is such that reasonable minds could not differ as to the outcome\" (quoting <i>Rol&#243;n-Alvarado,</i> 1 F.3d at 77)). We review the disposition of the motion <i>de novo,</i> applying the same standard. <i>Mangla,</i> 135 F.3d at 82.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, plaintiffs have challenged two of the district court's three determinations. The first challenge is to the district court's conclusion that the promotion of Cardona and M&#225;rquez to higher level positions in the career service within days of their transfers from trust to career positions was illegitimate. The second challenge is to the district court's conclusion that no evidence of political discrimination had been adduced. Left unchallenged, however, is the district court's determination that the positions to which Cardona and M&#225;rquez were promoted were (despite being designated \"career positions\" by the Puerto Rican career service) policymaking positions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The import of that conclusion appears to have eluded appellants' counsel, and the failure to challenge the determination is fatal to appellants' claims. While the general rule is that the dismissal of a public employee on the basis of the employee's political affiliation \"infringes First Amendment freedoms of belief and association,\" <i>Jimenez Fuentes v. Torres Gaztambide,</i> 807 F.2d 236, 239 (1st Cir.1986) (en banc), a vital exception to the rule is that politically motivated dismissals of public employees holding certain politically sensitive positions are both permissible and necessary in a system of representative democracy. <i>See id.</i> (quoting <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 367, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976)). The question a court must ask in deciding whether a post may be filled on the basis of political affiliation is whether such affiliation \"is an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved.\" <i>Id.</i> at 240 (quoting <i>Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 518, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980)). Although the designation of a position as a trust or career post under the Puerto Rican career service regime is a factor relevant to the determination whether the federal constitution permits political affiliation to be taken into account in making hiring and firing decisions with respect to the position, it is not determinative. <i>Id.</i> at 246.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the district court concluded that the stipulated and uncontested facts indicated that the job positions to which the appellants were promoted just before the election were political positions, and that denying the incoming administration the power to fill the positions with members of it own party would frustrate the efforts of the victors of the recent election to carry out the policy initiatives that it was their duty and mandate to implement. We need take no view as to whether this was in fact a correct conclusion on the evidence presented at trial. By failing to make the argument that the district court erred on this point, appellants have waived it and have effectively conceded the point. <i>See King v. Town of Hanover,</i> 116 F.3d 965, 970 (1st Cir.1997); <i>see also Pomerleau v. W. Springfield Pub. Sch.,</i> 362 F.3d 143, 147 n. 3 (1st Cir.2004). The conceded point is dispositive of this appeal: the appellants are bound by the district court's unchallenged conclusion that the First Amendment did not bar the defendants from removing them from their positions on the basis of their political affiliation, and so the district court's grant of judgment as a matter of law must stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, the entry of judgment by the district court is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This appeal was brought after the district court granted judgment as a matter of law in favor of the defendants, and so we recite the facts as presented by the plaintiffs, drawing any inferences in their favor</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> M&#225;rquez also stated a First Amendment claim arising out of an incident in which she was reprimanded after speaking critically about the new administration on the radio, but on appeal does not press any issues related to that claim</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> There may be a passing gesture at the point in the brief, but if so, it is insufficient to alert us to any error in the district judge's determination. \"[I]ssues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\"<i>United States v.

Cardona and M&#225;rquez are members of the New Progressive Party (NPP), which was until November 2000 the ruling party in the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. In 2000, the NPP administration was ousted when the Popular Democratic Party (PDP) won the November gubernatorial election. With the resultant change in the Puerto Rican administration in January 2001 came a rotation of the membership of the managerial echelon at various executive agencies. Like a spate of others decided in the course of the past few years, this case arises out of that shake-up. <i>See, e.g., Rodr&#237;guez-Mar&#237;n v.

The district court rendered judgment as a matter of law after the close of the plaintiffs' case-in-chief, finding, <i>inter alia,</i> that the plaintiffs could not prove unlawful political discrimination because the positions from which they were removed were political positions. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants here were, both before and after the 2000 elections, employees of the Regulations and Permits Administration, known by its Spanish acronym, ARPE.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The Puerto Rican career service recognizes two relevant categories of employees at state agencies like the ARPE: those who hold positions of trust and confidence, who are generally in the style of policy-makers and advisers and who are political appointees, <i>see</i> 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1350 (2000); and those who hold career positions, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 1352, who make up the bulk of the remainder of the public sector. In hiring the former, a potential employee's political affiliation is typically a vital consideration, while as to the latter, Puerto Rican law dictates that political affiliation is neither a relevant nor a permissible consideration. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1333.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Cardona and M&#225;rquez have each held both trust and career positions, but for a significant period prior to the election, each held a trust position. Puerto Rican law gives departing trust employees who came out of the career service the right to reclaim a career position equivalent to the career position they last held. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1350(8)(a); <i>see also Rosario-Urdaz,</i> 433 F.3d at 176. Our cases have noted other instances in which trust employees have made such a move prior to an election in which an opposing party may win, and made it at the latest date possible before the election. <i>See, e.g., Rodriguez-Marin,</i> 438 F.3d at 75; <i>Velez-Rivera,</i> 437 F.3d at 149. Puerto Rico has imposed a moratorium on such shifts during the two months prior to and the two months after an election, <i>see</i> 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1337, which means that these shifts into career positions tend to take place in August or early September before a November election. Accordingly, in August 2000, as the elections approached, both Cardona and M&#225;rquez moved from their trust positions into career positions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each briefly took a significant pay cut and reduction in assigned duties. Crucial to this case, however, both were quickly promoted to positions designated as career posts but carrying salaries commensurate with their old trust-position salaries.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 2000, the PDP won the Commonwealth-wide gubernatorial election, and in January 2001, the new administration took over. Roughly one year later, toward the end of January 2002, appellants both received letters signed by the new (PDP-affiliated) administrator of their division of the ARPE removing them to new positions. Each was given a brief informal hearing on the question of his or her reassignment. Cardona was moved from his recently acquired position as a class-II Administrative Facilitator, with a $4,000 monthly salary, to a statistician's job with a salary closer to $1,700. M&#225;rquez received a similar letter, informing her that she would lose her position as Manager of Services and Process, with its monthly salary of $4,300, and would resume work as an Internal Service Representative at a monthly rate of $2,500.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and the First and Fourteenth Amendments, alleging that their demotions and reductions of pay and perquisites were unconstitutional because motivated by political animosity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Named as defendants are various members of the new cadre of trust employees appointed to run the ARPE. The case went to trial on January 29, 2004, and plaintiffs concluded presentation of their case-in-chief on February 12, 2004. The defendants subsequently moved for judgment as a matter of law under Rule 50 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. The district court granted the defendants' motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court opinion granted judgment on the basis of three interrelated conclusions. The first was that Cardona and M&#225;rquez held their most recent positions illegitimately; the second was that the positions they held, while designated as \"career\" positions for purposes of the Puerto Rican career service, were nevertheless in fact the type of politically sensitive positions that the First Amendment permits to be filled on the basis of political affiliation; and the third was that the plaintiffs had not put forward evidence of discriminatory intent on the part of the defendants. The court ruled that the state's interest in filling the vacated positions with supporters of the incoming party's policies, taken together with the weakness of the evidence presented at trial of any politically discriminatory motive on the part of the defendants, meant that \"a reasonable jury could not conclude that Plaintiffs have met their burden establishing a cause of action for political discrimination in violation of the First Amendment of the United States Constitution pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Section 1983.\" Cardona and M&#225;rquez timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 50(a) permits a party to move for judgment as a matter of law before the case has been submitted to the jury.
