R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 04-1367\n\n      R.R. ISLA VERDE HOTEL CORP. and BENITO R. FERNANDEZ,\n\n                      Plaintiffs, Appellants,\n\n                                     v.\n\n              HOWARD JOHNSON INTERNATIONAL, INC.,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n       [Hon. Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Wallace V치zquez Sanabria on brief for appellants.\n     Arthur L. Pressman, Gordon M. Jones, III and Nixon Peabody,\nLLP, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           January 25, 2005\n\f           Per Curiam.    This is an appeal from the grant of summary\n\njudgment to the defendant, Howard Johnson International, Inc., in\n\na case brought by plaintiffs R.R. Isla Verde Hotel Corp. and its\n\nsole shareholder, Benito Fern치ndez, alleging that Howard Johnson\n\ntortiously interfered with plaintiffs' contractual arrangements\n\nwith a third party, Hotel Associates, Inc., to renovate and operate\n\na Howard Johnson hotel in San Juan, Puerto Rico.        We affirm, albeit\n\nfor reasons other than those given by the district court.\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\nA.   Summary Judgment Standards\n\n           This court reviews the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment de novo, applying the same criteria as the district court,\n\nAcosta v. Ames Dep't Stores, Inc., 386 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 2004),\n\nnamely,   whether    \"the    pleadings,      depositions,    answers   to\n\ninterrogatories,    and   admissions    on   file,   together   with   the\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law,\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).          The party opposing a\n\nproperly supported motion for summary judgment1 may not rest upon\n\nthe mere allegations or denials of the pleadings, \"but the adverse\n\nparty's response, by affidavits or as otherwise provided in this\n\nrule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a genuine\n\n\n\n      1\n      Plaintiffs do not argue that defendant's motion was not\nadequately supported.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fissue for trial.\"      Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).   If the opposing party\n\n\"fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of\n\nan element essential to that party's case, and on which that party\n\nwill bear the burden of proof at trial, . . . [t]he moving party is\n\n'entitled to judgment as a matter of law.'\"         Celotex Corp. v.\n\nCatrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c)); see also Whitman v. Miles, 387 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nB.   Tortious Interference with Contractual Relations\n\n            The parties plausibly agree that plaintiffs' tortious\n\ninterference claim is governed by the law of Puerto Rico, where the\n\nallegedly tortious conduct occurred.      Under Puerto Rico law, to\n\nprevail on a claim of tortious interference with a contractual\n\nrelationship, a plaintiff must show: (1) a contract with which the\n\ndefendant interferes, (2) tortious action by the defendant with\n\nknowledge of the contract's existence, (3) damage to the plaintiff,\n\nand (4) a causal relationship between the tortious conduct and the\n\ndamage.    See   Gen. Office Prods. Corp. v. A.M. Capen's Sons, Inc.,\n\n780 F.2d 1077, 1081-82 (1st Cir. 1986) (citing Gen. Office Prods.\n\nCorp. v. A.M. Capen's Sons, Inc., 115 P.R. Dec. 553, 558-59\n\n(1984)).    As the Puerto Rico Supreme Court has emphasized, the\n\nfirst element--existence of a contract for a fixed period of time--\n\nis \"indispensable,\" Dolphin Int'l, Inc. v. Ryder Truck Lines, Inc.,\n\n27 P.R. Offic. Trans. 869, ___ (1991); \"[i]f what is affected is .\n\n. . a profitable financial relationship where there is no contract,\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthe action does not lie . . . .\"    Gen. Office Prods. Corp, 780 F.2d\n\nat 1081.\n\n           Here, plaintiffs have stumbled on that first, essential\n\nstep.   The \"contract\" with which they allege interference is the\n\nalleged \"agreement between [plaintiffs and Hotel] Associates for\n\nthe development of the hotel, using the Howard Johnson's flag.\"\n\nHowever, in an attempt to reverse the entry of summary judgment on\n\nthis point, plaintiffs rely solely on the allegations of the\n\ncomplaint, which, as discussed above, are insufficient to meet\n\ntheir burden under Rule 56(e).     See Roger Edwards, LLC v. Fiddes &\n\nSons, Ltd., 387 F.3d 90, 94 (1st Cir. 2004) (finding \"'[c]onjectural\n\nallegations, conclusory assertions, and inconsequential evidence'\"\n\ninsufficient to meet opposing party's burden in defeating motion\n\nfor summary judgment)(citation omitted)).    Because plaintiffs have\n\nthus failed to meet their burden of demonstrating, \"by materials of\n\nevidentiary quality,\" Acosta, 386 F.3d at 8, a genuine dispute of\n\nfact as to this essential element of their claim, we affirm the\n\ndistrict court's entry of summary judgment on this ground, without\n\nreaching the merits of the alternative ground relied upon by the\n\ndistrict court.   See Hope Furnace Assocs., Inc. v. FDIC, 71 F.3d\n\n39, 42 (1st Cir. 1995) (stating that appellate court is free to\n\naffirm entry of summary judgment on any independently sufficient\n\nground).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f          The district court judgment is summarily affirmed.   See\n\nLoc. R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f",
