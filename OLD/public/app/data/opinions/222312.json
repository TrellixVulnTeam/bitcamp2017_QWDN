O'Connell,\nTrial Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n\n                            August 2, 2011\n\f           Per Curiam.   The petitioner, Sergio David González, is a\n\nGuatemalan national.     He seeks judicial review of a final order of\n\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), which affirmed an adverse\n\ndecision   of   an   immigration     judge   (IJ).    After   careful\n\nconsideration, we deny the petition.\n\n           We draw the facts largely from the petitioner's testimony\n\nin the immigration court.    The petitioner worked as a cabinetmaker\n\nin Guatemala City.     In the fall of 1989, he agreed to custom-make\n\ncabinets for a customer (referred by a friend).        After several\n\nweeks, the customer grew impatient and demanded that the petitioner\n\ncomplete the job quickly.      The petitioner hurried but, when he\n\ndelivered the finished cabinets, the customer complained about the\n\ndelay and refused to pay.    The customer then brandished a revolver\n\nand threatened to kill the petitioner unless he went away.\n\n           Although the petitioner departed posthaste, the customer\n\napparently was not appeased. He repeatedly called the petitioner's\n\nhome and made further threats.\n\n           Concerned for his safety, the petitioner approached a\n\nfriend who worked as a captain in the police force.      The captain\n\ntold him that the customer belonged to a unit of the Guatemalan\n\nsecret police and advised him against taking any action.         Soon\n\nafterwards, the petitioner, professing a fear that the disappointed\n\ncustomer would harm him, left Guatemala.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f          The petitioner entered the United States in 1990, by\n\nmeans of a B-2 visitor's visa.           He overstayed the permitted\n\nvisitation period without authorization and eventually settled in\n\nPawtucket, Rhode Island.\n\n          In   1994,   the    petitioner   applied   for   asylum    and\n\nwithholding of removal.      Inexplicably, eleven years passed before\n\nimmigration authorities conducted an asylum interview on September\n\n21, 2005. The following month, the Department of Homeland Security\n\ncommenced removal proceedings.\n\n          At his initial appearance before the IJ in February of\n\n2007, the petitioner conceded removability.          Subsequently, he\n\nupdated his application for asylum and withholding of removal by\n\nchecking the appropriate boxes on a standard form.     The petitioner\n\nfirst mentioned the allegedly menacing customer in this updated\n\napplication.\n\n          Following a hearing at which the petitioner testified,\n\nthe IJ found his testimony not credible and denied relief.1         As to\n\nthe asylum claim, the IJ found that the feared harm arose out of a\n\n\"personal disagreement\" rather than persecution, and that the\n\npetitioner had failed to establish a well-founded fear of future\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       Because the petitioner's claims fail on other grounds, we\nneed not assess the supportability of the IJ's adverse credibility\ndetermination.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fpersecution based on a statutorily protected ground.2                        The IJ\n\njettisoned   the       claim    for    withholding    of     removal    on   similar\n\nreasoning.       And although the petitioner had never raised a claim\n\nfor protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture\n\n(CAT), the IJ preemptively rejected such a claim.\n\n            The petitioner appealed unsuccessfully to the BIA.                     In\n\naffirming,       the    BIA    eschewed    reliance     on    the   IJ's     adverse\n\ncredibility determination and assumed the truth of the raw facts\n\nset   out   in    the    petitioner's      testimony.         But    despite      that\n\nassumption, the BIA found that the petitioner had failed to satisfy\n\nthe criteria for eligibility for asylum.                     It made a similar\n\ndisposition of the withholding of removal claim.                    Turning to the\n\nnascent CAT claim, the BIA overlooked the procedural default,\n\nindependently      reviewed      the    record,   and      determined      that    the\n\npetitioner did not satisfy the requirements for CAT protection.\n\nFinally, the BIA considered and rejected a contention that a book\n\nreview chronicling the slaying of a Guatemalan bishop, submitted by\n\nthe petitioner, lent credence to the petitioner's case.\n\n            This timely petition for judicial review followed.                      In\n\nit, the petitioner argues that the BIA erred in denying his asylum,\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       In general, applications for asylum must be brought within\none year of an alien's entrance into the United States or by April\n1, 1998 (whichever date is later). 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B); 8\nC.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(2)(ii). Because the petitioner first filed for\nasylum in 1994, his asylum request is timely.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fwithholding of removal, and CAT claims.    He also renews his plaint\n\nconcerning the probative value of the book review.\n\n           Where, as here, the BIA adopts portions of the IJ's\n\ndecision and adds its own gloss, we review the BIA's and IJ's\n\ndecisions as a unit.    Villa-Londono v. Holder, 600 F.3d 21, 23 (1st\n\nCir. 2010).      We assess an agency's findings of fact under the\n\nfamiliar substantial evidence rubric, which requires us to uphold\n\nthose findings as long as they are \"supported by reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.\"    INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992) (quoting\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1105a(a)(4)).    \"Absent an error of law, we will reverse\n\nonly if the record compels a conclusion contrary to that reached by\n\nthe [BIA].\"     Mariko v. Holder, 632 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2011).\n\n           Against this backdrop, we start with the asylum claim.\n\nTo be eligible for asylum, an alien must establish his status as a\n\nrefugee.    8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.13(a).    A refugee is a person who is unwilling or unable to\n\nrepatriate due to a well-founded fear of future persecution on\n\naccount of one of five statutorily protected grounds: \"race,\n\nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or\n\npolitical opinion.\"     Morgan v. Holder, 634 F.3d 53, 57 (1st Cir.\n\n2011) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A)).        A showing of past\n\npersecution creates a rebuttable presumption that an alien harbors\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fa well-founded fear of future persecution.     Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,\n\n427 F.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           In the immigration context, \"persecution\" is a term of\n\nart.   To qualify, an alien must show a quantum of harm beyond \"mere\n\ndiscomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment, or unfair treatment.\"\n\nId.; see Bocova v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nFurthermore, that harm must be linked in some meaningful way to the\n\ngovernment.   Morgan, 634 F.3d at 57.\n\n           Measured against these benchmarks, the infirmities in the\n\npetitioner's asylum claim are manifest. First and foremost, he has\n\nfailed to hitch his claim to any statutorily protected ground.\n\nWhile he asserts that he is a member of a particular social group,\n\nhe has not made any effort to describe the contours of the social\n\ngroup in which he asserts membership.\n\n           It is clear beyond hope of contradiction that, at a\n\nminimum, social group members \"must share a common, immutable\n\ncharacteristic, either innate or based on past experiences.\"       Faye\n\nv. Holder, 580 F.3d 37, 41 (1st Cir. 2009).          The petitioner's\n\nconclusory allegation does not satisfy this requirement, and the\n\nrecord   contains   no   specifics   that   might   fill   the   gap.\n\nConsequently, his asylum claim founders.     See id. at 42; López de\n\nHincapie v. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 213, 218-19 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n           There is a second independently sufficient ground that\n\nsupports the BIA's denial of asylum: the petitioner has not shown\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fa   well-founded    fear    of   persecution.     A    well-founded   fear   of\n\npersecution \"must be both subjectively genuine and objectively\n\nreasonable.\"    Morgan, 634 F.3d at 58.         Such a fear is objectively\n\nreasonable only if a reasonable person in the alien's circumstances\n\nwould harbor it. Id.; Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 572 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).     Here, substantial evidence supports the agency's\n\ndetermination      that    the   petitioner's   fear    is   not   objectively\n\nreasonable.\n\n           The petitioner alleges that the threats made by his\n\nquondam customer give rise to his fear.               The record shows that\n\nthese threats occurred over eighteen years before the petitioner's\n\nhearing in the immigration court, and the petitioner has not\n\nproffered any evidence suggesting that his tormentor is still\n\nalive, or still in Guatemala, or still in a position to wreak\n\nvengeance, or still holds a grudge.         Eighteen years would be a long\n\ntime to brood over a delayed delivery of furniture.                Given this\n\nhiatus and the utter lack of any evidence suggesting a current\n\nthreat, the agency's conclusion that the petitioner's claimed fear\n\nis objectively unreasonable is supported by substantial evidence.3\n\nSee, e.g., Touch v. Holder, 568 F.3d 32, 40-41 (1st Cir. 2009)\n\n(upholding denial of asylum where claimant's fear was based on\n\n\n      3\n       The fact that the customer has not harmed the petitioner's\nsiblings, children, or other family members (all of whom still\nreside in Guatemala) further belies the reasonableness of the\npetitioner's fear. See Bakuaya v. Mukasey, 533 F.3d 39, 41 (1st\nCir. 2008) (per curiam); Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 573.\n\n                                      -7-\n\fevents that occurred seven years prior to BIA's decision); Jiang v.\n\nGonzales, 474 F.3d 25, 31 (1st Cir. 2007) (similar; five-year\n\ninterval); cf. Bonilla-Morales v. Holder, 607 F.3d 1132, 1139-40\n\n(6th Cir. 2010) (denying CAT claim where alien failed to establish\n\nthat alleged tormentor was still alive); Chahid Hayek v. Gonzales,\n\n445   F.3d   501,   508-09   (1st    Cir.   2006)   (per   curiam)   (finding\n\npetitioner's fear based on events that took place eleven years\n\nearlier insufficient to ground CAT claim).\n\n             In an effort to blunt the force of this reasoning, the\n\npetitioner    points   to    the    aforementioned   book    review.    This\n\ndocument, which concerns a different individual in materially\n\ndifferent circumstances, does not change the decisional calculus.\n\nThe tale is simply too attenuated to generate an objectively\n\nreasonable fear of persecution on the petitioner's part.             See Seng\n\nv. Holder, 584 F.3d 13, 19-20 (1st Cir. 2009) (concluding that\n\nallegations of human rights abuses, without any particularized\n\nconnection to the petitioner, are insufficient, in themselves, to\n\nground a well-founded fear of persecution).\n\n             This brings us to the petitioner's quest for withholding\n\nof removal.     Eligibility for withholding of removal requires that\n\nan alien satisfy a standard that is similar to, but more stringent\n\nthan, the standard for asylum.        Villa-Londono, 600 F.3d at 24 n.1;\n\nRodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nThe former requires a \"clear probability of persecution,\" whereas\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fthe latter requires only a well-founded fear of persecution.              Ang\n\nv. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 50, 58 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           The difference in these standards is telling when asylum\n\nand withholding of removal claims are premised on the same nucleus\n\nof   operative   facts.   In   that   event,    the   alien's   failure    to\n\nestablish eligibility for asylum on the merits necessarily dooms\n\nhis counterpart claim for withholding of removal.          Villa-Londono,\n\n600 F.3d at 24 n.1; Rodriguez-Ramirez, 398 F.3d at 123.           So it is\n\nhere.\n\n           Finally, the BIA ruled that even if a CAT claim was\n\nproperly in the case, it would fail.      We follow the BIA's lead and\n\nassume, for argument's sake, that a CAT claim was seasonably\n\nraised.   Even so, there is a threshold problem: the argument that\n\nthe petitioner advances in this court rests on a different theory\n\nof CAT protection than the argument that he made to the BIA, where\n\nhe argued that the police captain's admonition to him showed that\n\nthe Guatemalan government acquiesced in violence by the secret\n\npolice.   Here, by contrast, the petitioner for the first time ties\n\nGuatemalan   secret   police   activity    to    gang    violence.        The\n\npetitioner's failure to advance this theory before the BIA is\n\nfatal.    See Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(explaining that \"theories not advanced before the BIA may not be\n\nsurfaced for the first time in a petition for judicial review of\n\nthe BIA's final order\").\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f            In   all   events,   the    petitioner    has   not   carried   his\n\nevidentiary burden with respect to the CAT claim.                 To establish\n\neligibility for CAT protection, an alien must show that it is \"more\n\nlikely than not\" that he would be tortured if removed to his\n\nhomeland.    8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2).          For this purpose, \"torture\"\n\nis an intentional act that inflicts severe physical or mental pain\n\nor suffering upon a person.       Id. § 208.18(a)(1).       The torture must\n\nbe \"inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or\n\nacquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an\n\nofficial capacity.\"       Chhay v. Mukasey, 540 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.\n\n2008) (quoting 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1)).\n\n            Given this standard, the petitioner's CAT claim cannot\n\nsurvive scrutiny.      It rests on sheer speculation; he has not made\n\na showing that he will, more likely than not, be targeted and\n\ntortured if he returns to Guatemala.             The possibility of harm at\n\nthe hands of the secret police is, for the reasons discussed above,\n\npure speculation. And the mere possibility that he will be exposed\n\nto random violence is not enough.             See Amouri v. Holder, 572 F.3d\n\n29, 35 (1st Cir. 2009); López de Hincapie, 494 F.3d at 221.\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nthe petition for judicial review is denied.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f",

And although the petitioner had never raised a claim\n\nfor protection under the United Nations Convention Against Torture\n\n(CAT), the IJ preemptively rejected such a claim.\n\n            The petitioner appealed unsuccessfully to the BIA.                     In\n\naffirming,       the    BIA    eschewed    reliance     on    the   IJ's     adverse\n\ncredibility determination and assumed the truth of the raw facts\n\nset   out   in    the    petitioner's      testimony.         But    despite      that\n\nassumption, the BIA found that the petitioner had failed to satisfy\n\nthe criteria for eligibility for asylum.                     It made a similar\n\ndisposition of the withholding of removal claim.                    Turning to the\n\nnascent CAT claim, the BIA overlooked the procedural default,\n\nindependently      reviewed      the    record,   and      determined      that    the\n\npetitioner did not satisfy the requirements for CAT protection.\n\nFinally, the BIA considered and rejected a contention that a book\n\nreview chronicling the slaying of a Guatemalan bishop, submitted by\n\nthe petitioner, lent credence to the petitioner's case.\n\n            This timely petition for judicial review followed.                      In\n\nit, the petitioner argues that the BIA erred in denying his asylum,\n\n\n\n\n      2\n       In general, applications for asylum must be brought within\none year of an alien's entrance into the United States or by April\n1, 1998 (whichever date is later). 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B); 8\nC.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(2)(ii). Because the petitioner first filed for\nasylum in 1994, his asylum request is timely.\n\n                                          -4-\n\fwithholding of removal, and CAT claims.    He also renews his plaint\n\nconcerning the probative value of the book review.\n\n           Where, as here, the BIA adopts portions of the IJ's\n\ndecision and adds its own gloss, we review the BIA's and IJ's\n\ndecisions as a unit.

Such a fear is objectively\n\nreasonable only if a reasonable person in the alien's circumstances\n\nwould harbor it. Id.; Aguilar-Solis v.

Here, substantial evidence supports the agency's\n\ndetermination      that    the   petitioner's   fear    is   not   objectively\n\nreasonable.\n\n           The petitioner alleges that the threats made by his\n\nquondam customer give rise to his fear.               The record shows that\n\nthese threats occurred over eighteen years before the petitioner's\n\nhearing in the immigration court, and the petitioner has not\n\nproffered any evidence suggesting that his tormentor is still\n\nalive, or still in Guatemala, or still in a position to wreak\n\nvengeance, or still holds a grudge.         Eighteen years would be a long\n\ntime to brood over a delayed delivery of furniture.                Given this\n\nhiatus and the utter lack of any evidence suggesting a current\n\nthreat, the agency's conclusion that the petitioner's claimed fear\n\nis objectively unreasonable is supported by substantial evidence.3\n\nSee, e.g., Touch v.

This\n\ndocument, which concerns a different individual in materially\n\ndifferent circumstances, does not change the decisional calculus.\n\nThe tale is simply too attenuated to generate an objectively\n\nreasonable fear of persecution on the petitioner's part.

Eligibility for withholding of removal requires that\n\nan alien satisfy a standard that is similar to, but more stringent\n\nthan, the standard for asylum.

In   that   event,    the   alien's   failure    to\n\nestablish eligibility for asylum on the merits necessarily dooms\n\nhis counterpart claim for withholding of removal.          Villa-Londono,\n\n600 F.3d at 24 n.1; Rodriguez-Ramirez, 398 F.3d at 123.           So it is\n\nhere.\n\n           Finally, the BIA ruled that even if a CAT claim was\n\nproperly in the case, it would fail.      We follow the BIA's lead and\n\nassume, for argument's sake, that a CAT claim was seasonably\n\nraised.   Even so, there is a threshold problem: the argument that\n\nthe petitioner advances in this court rests on a different theory\n\nof CAT protection than the argument that he made to the BIA, where\n\nhe argued that the police captain's admonition to him showed that\n\nthe Guatemalan government acquiesced in violence by the secret\n\npolice.   Here, by contrast, the petitioner for the first time ties\n\nGuatemalan   secret   police   activity    to    gang    violence.
