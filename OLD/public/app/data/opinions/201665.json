Plaintiff-appellant Nereida\n\nRuiz-Casillas appeals the summary judgment entered in favor of\n\ndefendants-appellees Mayor and Federal Programs Director of the\n\nMunicipality of Humacao for claims of political discrimination\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983.    Specifically, Ruiz contests the district\n\ncourt's finding that she occupied a policymaking trust position,\n\nthereby foreclosing her First and Fourteenth Amendment claims given\n\nthe party affiliation requirement.         Appellant also argues that,\n\ndespite her dismissed causes of action, the district court erred in\n\nfailing to address defendants' qualified immunity defense.            After\n\ncareful review, we affirm.\n\n                            I.   Background\n\n          Ruiz, an employee of the Municipality of Humacao, Puerto\n\nRico and a member of the Popular Democratic Party (PDP), has served\n\nas Administrative Director of the Federal Programs Division of\n\nHumacao since 1985.      Although her appointment as Administrative\n\nDirector was initially transitory, the position was made permanent\n\nby virtue of a 1991 ordinance.1\n\n          In January 2001, defendant-appellee Marcelo Trujillo-\n\nPanisse   became   the   Mayor   of     Humacao   and,   as   such,    took\n\nresponsibility for establishing the municipality's public policy,\n\n\n\n1\n   The \"Programmatic\" Director position was held by Zaida Pérez\nfrom 1985 until 1996, when Pérez departed. This position remained\nvacant until 2001, making Ruiz the de facto Director in the interim\nperiod.\n\n                                  -2-\n\forganization,     and   personnel   regulation.          Trujillo    appointed\n\ndefendant-appellee      Luis   Camacho-Morales      as    Director    of    the\n\nMunicipality's Federal Programs Division that same year.                   Like\n\nRuiz, both Trujillo and Camacho are members of the PDP.\n\n           Ruiz alleges that after defendants' assumption of power,\n\nthey   harassed   and   discriminated     against   her    by,   inter     alia,\n\nstripping her of the job's functions and duties, denying her access\n\nto a phone line, telling other employees not to speak with her, and\n\nacting aggressively towards her.          These actions were allegedly\n\nspurred by Ruiz's political beliefs, specifically, her support for\n\nthe previous mayor and administration, who were affiliated with the\n\nrival New Progressive Party (NPP).\n\n           On November 6, 2002, Ruiz filed a complaint in the\n\nfederal district court for the District of Puerto Rico, which she\n\namended on February 10, 2003 to add First and Fourteenth Amendment\n\nclaims under § 1983.       Defendants moved for summary judgment on\n\nSeptember 11, 2003, arguing, inter alia, that the claim was barred\n\nby the statute of limitations defense, that Ruiz had failed to\n\nestablish a prima facie case, and that they had qualified immunity.\n\n           On April 27, 2004, the district court granted defendants'\n\nsummary judgment motion and dismissed Ruiz's claims. Ruiz-Casillas\n\nv. Camacho-Morales, No. 02-2640 (D.P.R. Apr. 27, 2004).              The court\n\nreviewed the record properly before it to find that the nature of\n\nRuiz's tasks and her position's close involvement with high-level\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fpolicymakers indicated that she was a policymaking trust employee,\n\nfor    whom    party   affiliation       was   an    appropriate      employment\n\nrequirement.      Id. at 13-23.         The court also found that Ruiz's\n\nFourteenth Amendment claim faltered because as a trust employee,\n\nshe had no cognizable property interest in her trust employment for\n\na due process claim, id. at 23-24, and her equal protection claim\n\nmerely restated her failed First Amendment claim, id. at 24-25.\n\nHaving dismissed all causes of action, the court declined to\n\naddress the qualified immunity defense.             Id.   This appeal follows.\n\n                                II.     Analysis\n\nA.    First Amendment\n\n              Ruiz first argues that the district court erred in\n\nfinding that she had occupied a \"political\" position, and thus\n\nlacked    a     colorable     First     Amendment     claim     for    political\n\ndiscrimination on the basis of party affiliation.                     We are not\n\nconvinced.\n\n              Summary judgment entries are reviewed de novo, viewing\n\nall facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and\n\ngranting all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. See,\n\ne.g., Torres v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours & Co., 219 F.3d 13, 18 (1st\n\nCir.   2000).      Such     judgments    are   upheld     \"if   the   pleadings,\n\ndepositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\n\ntogether with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fto a judgment as a matter of law.\"       Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).      Summary\n\njudgments will also be upheld \"if the nonmoving party rests merely\n\nupon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported\n\nspeculation,\" Medina-Muñoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 896 F.2d\n\n5, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).        Finally, our inquiry as to whether a\n\ngovernment position is \"political,\" though fact intensive, presents\n\na question of law requiring a de novo assessment of all relevant\n\nevidence.    Ortiz-Piñero v. Rivera-Arroyo, 84 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n            In political discrimination cases, plaintiffs must first\n\nestablish that party affiliation was a substantial or motivating\n\nfactor behind the adverse employment action.          See Mt. Healthy City\n\nSch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977).\n\nDefendants    then   carry   the   burden     to     establish     either     a\n\nnondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action, see id. at 287,\n\nor that plaintiff held a \"political position,\" for which party\n\naffiliation    constitutes   \"an   appropriate       requirement    for     the\n\neffective performance of the public office involved,\" Branti v.\n\nFinkel, 445 U.S. 507, 518 (1980).      See Ortiz-Piñero, 84 F.3d at 12.\n\nUnlike non-policymaking career positions, \"political positions\" are\n\nterminable    without   cause   when     political    affiliation     is     an\n\nappropriate requirement for the position.            See, e.g.,     Elrod v.\n\nBurns, 427 U.S. 347, 362-63 (1976); Galloza v. Foy, 389 F.3d 26,\n\n28-29 (1st Cir. 2004).       This rule ensures that \"representative\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fgovernment [will] not be undercut by tactics obstructing the\n\nimplementation of policies of the new administration, policies\n\npresumably sanctioned by the electorate.\"        Elrod, 427 U.S. at 367.\n\n           In determining whether a position is \"political,\" we\n\nengage in a two-step inquiry: (1) whether the governmental unit\n\ndecides \"issues where there is room for political disagreement on\n\ngoals or their implementation,\" and (2) whether the position's\n\nresponsibilities \"resemble[] [those of] a policymaker, a privy to\n\nconfidential information, a communicator, or some other office\n\nholder whose function is such that party affiliation is an equally\n\nappropriate requirement.\"     Jiménez Fuentes v. Torres Gaztambide,\n\n807 F.2d 236, 241-42 (1st Cir. 1986) (en banc); see also Galloza,\n\n389 F.3d at 29-30; Duriex-Gauthier v. López-Nieves, 274 F.3d 4, 9\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).\n\n           In   determining   the    second    prong,   we   examine   the\n\nposition's \"inherent attributes,\" for which the job description is\n\nthe most useful starting point.           Galloza, 389 F.3d at 31.     Job\n\ndescriptions that are broad or open ended -- given the employee's\n\nlatitude to exercise discretionary judgment -- generally indicate\n\na policymaking position, while job descriptions that are narrowly\n\ncircumscribed inhibit freedom of action and generally indicate a\n\nnon-policymaking position.     Id.     The job title, however, is not\n\nnecessarily dispositive in the inquiry, Duriex-Gauthier, 274 F.3d\n\nat 8.   Instead, we examine other indicia including \"relative pay,\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\ftechnical competence, power to control others, authority to speak\n\nin the name of policymakers, public perception, influence on\n\nprograms, contact with elected officials, . . . responsiveness to\n\npartisan     politics     and   political     leaders     .   .   .   [and]\n\nresponsibilities that are not well defined or are of broad scope.\"\n\nJiménez    Fuentes,   807   F.2d   at   242   (internal   quotation   marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            Before delving into our inquiry, we note that appellant\n\nhas submitted voluminous documents to this court that were never\n\nintroduced, or were never properly introduced,2 before the district\n\ncourt.     Our inquiry, therefore, is limited to the record properly\n\nbefore the court.       See Fed. R. App. P. 10(a).\n\n            The resolution of the instant case revolves around the\n\nsecond prong described above, as \"the OFP [Office of Federal\n\nPrograms] unmistakably is a municipal department or agency whose\n\noverall functions involve decision making on issues where there is\n\nroom for political disagreement on goals or their implementation.\"\n\nOrtiz-Piñero, 84 F.3d at 12-13 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            Our examination of the second prong -- for which the job\n\ndescription3 is the most useful starting point -- indicates that\n\n\n2\n   The district court declined to consider one document submitted\nby defendants which failed to comply with the requirements of 48\nU.S.C. § 864 (2000 & Supp. 2003).\n3\n  Although neither party submitted a proper job description before\nthe district court (defendants submitted an untranslated copy of\nRuiz's job description which was not considered), defendants\n\n                                    -7-\n\fappellant's responsibilities resemble those of a policymaker.               Her\n\nduties are broad and open-ended:           \"[a]ny matter for the mayor\n\nreferred to [her] regarding the [federal] programs.\"                   Docket\n\nDocument No. 52.      Moreover, Ruiz remained in continuous contact\n\nwith the Mayor and the Director regarding the progress of projects,\n\nattended   meetings,     seminars,    Housing    and    Development    (HUD)\n\norientation,   and    accomplished   various    tasks   which     demonstrate\n\n\"technical competence, power to control others, authority to speak\n\nin the name of policymakers, . . . influence on programs, [and]\n\ncontact with elected officials.\"4          Jiménez Fuentes, 807 F.2d at\n\n242.   Furthermore,      Ruiz's   \"relative     pay,\"   another    factor    we\n\nconsider, see id., is only $100 less than the monthly salary of\n\nDirector Camacho, whose position is indisputably a \"political\"\n\ntrust position.      We also note that when Camacho left the director\n\noffice on October 9, 2001, Ruiz assumed the de facto position of\n\ndirector, assuming duties including the supervision of employees.5\n\n\nsubmitted certified translations of Ruiz's deposition discussing\nher job description, which forms the basis of our inquiry. This\ndeposition testimony merely recites the duties in Ruiz's official,\nwritten job description (Form OP-16).\n4\n   After Camacho assumed the Director position, Ruiz admits to,\ninter alia, participating in the preparation of a HUD monitoring\nreport, reviewing professional services contracts, attending\nmeetings with auditors to discuss audit reports, sending a memo to\nCamacho regarding the dress code, reviewing contracts regarding the\nbuilding facilities, and drafting communication directing employees\nto take ethics seminars. Ruiz Casillas, No. 02-2640 at 19-20.\n5\n    It also appears that Ruiz occupied the de facto director\nposition from 1996 until 2001, when the Director position was\n\n                                     -8-\n\fGiven Ruiz's broad-based responsibilities,6 as well as her close-\n\nworking relationships with policymakers, we find that she occupied\n\na \"political\" trust position, for which party affiliation is a\n\nrequirement, see Jiménez Fuentes, 807 F.2d at 240.\n\n             Appellant nonetheless attempts to salvage her claim by\n\narguing that the Administrative Director position was labeled as a\n\n\"career\" position by a 1991 municipal ordinance.               While such\n\ndesignation might be entitled to some deference by this court,\n\n\"[w]e have consistently held that the job description is the best,\n\nand sometimes dispositive, source for determining the inherent\n\nfunctions of the position.\"      Duriex-Gauthier, 274 F.3d at 8.       This\n\nis the case here, where an examination of Ruiz's job description\n\nstrongly     indicates   that   she    occupied    a   policymaking   trust\n\nposition.7\n\n             Appellant also alleges that the district court erred in\n\nrelying on her deposition testimony relating to tasks she performed\n\nas Director and Administrative Director.          The deposition testimony\n\nanalyzed by the district court, however, merely recites the duties\n\n\nunoccupied.\n6\n   Although the record indicates that Ruiz also performed more\nspecific tasks, such as answering mail and phone calls, we find\nthat her overall job description accords more closely to a\npolicymaking position.\n7\n   Furthermore, the \"Programmatic\" Director position, like the\nAdministrative Director position, is likewise labeled as \"career,\"\nfurther indicating the gap between position labels and actual job\nfunctions.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fin appellant's official, written job description (Form OP-16).                   We\n\ntherefore find no error in the district court's reliance on the\n\ndeposition testimony.\n\n             Since    appellant's      Administrative       Director     position\n\nresembles that of a policymaking trust employee -- for which party\n\naffiliation is an appropriate requirement -- her First Amendment\n\nclaim necessarily founders.         Thus, we affirm the district court's\n\nentry of summary judgment on her First Amendment claim.\n\nB.   Fourteenth Amendment\n\n             Appellant further argues that even if she had performed\n\ncertain policymaking duties, this did not extinguish her \"career\"\n\nposition and the due process \"property rights\" attached thereunder.\n\nThis argument also fails.\n\n             The   Due    Process   Clause     of   the   Fourteenth     Amendment\n\nprotects government employees who possess property interests in\n\ncontinued    public      employment.     See    Cleveland    Bd.    of   Educ.   v.\n\nLoudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 541 (1985); Galloza, 389 F.3d at 33.                   To\n\ndetermine whether public employees possess such a property right,\n\nwe examine the local law and the terms and conditions of the\n\nemployment arrangement.         See id.; Ortiz-Piñero, 84 F.3d at 17.\n\nUnder Puerto Rico law, public employees are categorized into either\n\ncareer or trust/confidential positions.              3 P.R. Laws Ann.      § 1349.\n\nTrust   or    confidential      employees       \"intervene     or    collaborate\n\nsubstantially in the formation of the public policy, [and] . . .\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fadvise directly or render direct services to the head of the agency\n\n. . . .\"      Id. § 1350.   Unlike career employees, who are removable\n\nonly    for   cause,   trust    employees    are   of   \"free   selection   and\n\nremoval.\"       Id.     Thus,    \"trust     [employees]   do[]   not   have   a\n\nconstitutionally protected property interest in that position.\"\n\nGalloza, 389 F.3d at 34.\n\n              In any event, whether or not appellant's downgrading of\n\nduties would constitute adverse action for purposes of the First\n\nAmendment, Ruiz was not fired, and \"[u]nder Puerto Rico law, public\n\nemployees have a property interest in their continued employment,\n\nnot in the functions they perform.\"           Rosado de Vélez v. Zayas, 328\n\nF. Supp. 2d 202, 212 (D.P.R. 2004) (citing Consejo de Educación de\n\nla U.P.R. v. Roselló, 137 D.P.R. 83, 110 (1994)).                   The equal\n\nprotection claim also founders, as it is a mere restatement of\n\nappellant's failed First Amendment claim.           See, e.g., Néstor Colón\n\nMedina & Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio, 964 F.2d 32, 45 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (finding \"little basis or justification for applying equal\n\nprotection analysis\" where Equal Protection claim overlapped with\n\nfailed First Amendment claim).        We therefore affirm on this issue.\n\nC.     Qualified Immunity\n\n              The failure of appellant's constitutional claims obviates\n\nour need to address the qualified immunity defense: we have found\n\nno constitutional violation. See Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office,\n\n298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing Hope v. Pelzer, 536 U.S.\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f730 (2002); Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201 (2001); Siegert v.\n\nGilley, 500 U.S. 226, 232 (1991)) (\"The threshold inquiry [in\n\ndetermining whether an official is entitled to qualified immunity]\n\nis whether the plaintiff's allegations, if true, establish a\n\nconstitutional violation.\").   The district court's judgment is\n\naffirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f",

Trujillo appointed defendant-appellee Luis Camacho-Morales as Director of the Municipality's Federal Programs Division that same year. Like Ruiz, both Trujillo and Camacho are members of the PDP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ruiz alleges that after defendants' assumption of power, they harassed and discriminated against her by, <i>inter alia,</i> stripping her of the job's functions and duties, denying her access to a phone line, telling other employees not to speak with her, and acting aggressively towards her. These actions were allegedly spurred by Ruiz's political beliefs, specifically, her support for the previous mayor and administration, who were affiliated with the rival New Progressive Party (NPP).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 6, 2002, Ruiz filed a complaint in the federal district court for the District of Puerto Rico, which she amended on February 10, 2003 to add First and Fourteenth Amendment claims under &#167; 1983. Defendants moved for summary judgment on September 11, 2003, arguing, <i>inter alia,</i> that the claim was barred by the statute of limitations defense, that Ruiz had failed to establish a prima facie case, and that they had qualified immunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 27, 2004, the district court granted defendants' summary judgment motion and dismissed Ruiz's claims. <i>Ruiz-Casillas v. Camacho-Morales,</i> No. 02-2640 (D.P.R. April 27, 2004). The court reviewed the record properly before it to find that the nature of Ruiz's tasks and her position's close involvement with high-level policymakers indicated that she was a policymaking trust employee, for whom party affiliation was an appropriate employment requirement. <i>Id.</i> at 13-23. The court also found that Ruiz's Fourteenth Amendment claim faltered because as a trust employee, she had no cognizable property interest in her trust employment for a due process claim, <i>id.</i> at 23-24, and her equal protection claim merely restated her failed First Amendment claim, <i>id.</i> at 24-25. Having dismissed all causes of action, the court declined to address the qualified immunity defense. <i>Id.</i> This appeal follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Analysis</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>First Amendment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ruiz first argues that the district court erred in finding that she had occupied a \"political\" position, and thus lacked a colorable First Amendment claim for political discrimination on the basis of party affiliation. We are not convinced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Summary judgment entries are reviewed <i>de novo,</i> viewing all facts in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party and granting all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. <i>See, e.g., Torres v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> 219 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir.2000). Such judgments are upheld \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). Summary judgments will also be upheld \"if the nonmoving party rests merely upon conclusory allegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation,\" <i>Medina-Munoz v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,</i> 896 F.2d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1990). Finally, our inquiry as to whether a government position is \"political,\" though fact intensive, presents a question of law requiring a <i>de novo</i> assessment of all relevant evidence. <i>Ortiz-Pinero v. Rivera-Arroyo,</i> 84 F.3d 7, 12 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In political discrimination cases, plaintiffs must first establish that party affiliation was a substantial or motivating factor behind the adverse employment action. <i>See Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977). Defendants then carry the burden to establish <i>either</i> a nondiscriminatory reason for the challenged action, <i>see id.</i> at 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, <i>or</i> that plaintiff held a \"political position,\" for which party affiliation constitutes \"an appropriate requirement for the effective performance of the public office involved,\" <i>Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 518, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980). <i>See Ortiz-Pi&#241;ero,</i> 84 F.3d at 12. Unlike non-policymaking career positions, \"political positions\" are terminable without cause when political affiliation is an appropriate requirement for the position. <i>See, e.g., Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 362-63, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976); <i>Galloza v. Foy,</i> 389 F.3d 26, 28-29 (1st Cir.2004). This rule ensures that \"representative government [will] not be undercut by tactics obstructing the implementation of policies of the new administration, policies presumably sanctioned by the electorate.\" <i>Elrod,</i> 427 U.S. at 367, 96 S.Ct. 2673.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining whether a position is \"political,\" we engage in a two-step inquiry: (1) whether the governmental unit decides \"issues where there is room for political disagreement on goals or their implementation,\" and (2) whether the position's responsibilities \"resemble[] [those of] a policymaker, a privy to confidential information, a communicator, or some other office holder whose function is such that party affiliation is an equally appropriate requirement.\" <i>Jim&#233;nez Fuentes v. Torres Gaztambide,</i> 807 F.2d 236, 241-42 (1st Cir. 1986) (en banc); <i>see also Galloza,</i> 389 F.3d at 29-30; <i>Duriex-Gauthier v. L&#243;pez-Nieves,</i> 274 F.3d 4, 9 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In determining the second prong, we examine the position's \"inherent attributes,\" for which the job description is the most useful starting point. <i>Galloza,</i> 389 F.3d at 31. Job descriptions that are broad or open ended &#8212; given the employee's latitude to exercise discretionary judgment &#8212; generally indicate a policymaking position, while job descriptions that are narrowly circumscribed inhibit freedom of action and generally indicate a non-policymaking position. <i>Id.</i> The job title, however, is not necessarily dispositive in the inquiry, <i>Duriex-Gauthier,</i> 274 F.3d at 8. Instead, we examine other indicia including \"relative pay, technical competence, power to control others, authority to speak in the name of policymakers, public perception, influence on programs, contact with elected officials, ... responsiveness to partisan politics and political leaders ... [and] responsibilities that are not well defined or are of broad scope.\" <i>Jim&#233;nez Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 242 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before delving into our inquiry, we note that appellant has submitted voluminous documents to this court that were never introduced, or were never properly introduced,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> before the district court. Our inquiry, therefore, is limited to the record properly before the court. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 10(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The resolution of the instant case revolves around the second prong described above, as \"the OFP [Office of Federal Programs] unmistakably is a municipal department or agency whose overall functions involve decision making on issues where there is room for political disagreement on goals or their implementation.\" <i>Ortiz-Pi&#241;ero,</i> 84 F.3d at 12-13 (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our examination of the second prong &#8212; for which the job description<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> is the most useful starting point &#8212; indicates that appellant's responsibilities resemble those of a policymaker. Her duties are broad and open-ended: \"[a]ny matter for the mayor referred to [her] regarding the [federal] programs.\" <i>Docket Document No. 52.</i> Moreover, Ruiz remained in continuous contact with the Mayor and the Director regarding the progress of projects, attended meetings, seminars, Housing and Development (HUD) orientation, and accomplished various tasks which demonstrate \"technical competence, power to control others, authority to speak in the name of policymakers, ... influence on programs, [and] contact with elected officials.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Jim&#233;nez Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 242. Furthermore, Ruiz's \"relative pay,\" another factor we consider, <i>see id.,</i> is only $100 less than the monthly salary of Director Camacho, whose position is indisputably a \"political\" trust position. We also note that when Camacho left the director office on October 9, 2001, Ruiz assumed the <i>de facto</i> position of director, assuming duties including the supervision of employees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Given Ruiz's broad-based responsibilities,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> as well as her close-working relationships with policymakers, we find that she occupied a \"political\" trust position, for which party affiliation is a requirement, <i>see Jim&#233;nez Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 240.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant nonetheless attempts to salvage her claim by arguing that the Administrative Director position was labeled as a \"career\" position by a 1991 municipal ordinance. While such designation might be entitled to some deference by this court, \"[w]e have consistently held that the job description is the best, and sometimes dispositive, source for determining the inherent functions of the position.\" <i>Duriex-Gauthier,</i> 274 F.3d at 8. This is the case here, where an examination of Ruiz's job description strongly indicates that she occupied a policymaking trust position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also alleges that the district court erred in relying on her deposition testimony relating to tasks she performed as Director and Administrative Director. The deposition testimony analyzed by the district court, however, merely recites the duties in appellant's official, written job description (Form OP-16). We therefore find no error in the district court's reliance on the deposition testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since appellant's Administrative Director position resembles that of a policymaking trust employee &#8212; for which party affiliation is an appropriate requirement &#8212; her First Amendment claim necessarily founders. Thus, we affirm the district court's entry of summary judgment on her First Amendment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Fourteenth Amendment</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant further argues that even if she had performed certain policymaking duties, this did not extinguish her \"career\" position and the due process \"property rights\" attached thereunder. This argument also fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects government employees who possess property interests in continued public employment. <i>See Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. 532, 541, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985); <i>Galloza,</i> 389 F.3d at 33. To determine whether public employees possess such a property right, we examine the local law and the terms and conditions of the employment arrangement. <i>See id.; Ortiz-Pi&#241;ero,</i> 84 F.3d at 17. Under Puerto Rico law, public employees are categorized into either career or trust/confidential positions. 3 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167; 1349. Trust or confidential employees \"intervene or collaborate substantially in the formation of the public policy, [and] ... advise directly or render direct services to the head of the agency....\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1350. Unlike career employees, who are removable only for cause, trust employees are of \"free selection and removal.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, \"trust [employees] do[] not have a constitutionally protected property interest in that position.\" <i>Galloza,</i> 389 F.3d at 34.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, whether or not appellant's downgrading of duties would constitute adverse action for purposes of the First Amendment, Ruiz was not fired, and \"[u]nder Puerto Rico law, public employees have a property interest in their continued employment, not in the functions they perform.\" <i>Rosado De V&#233;lez v. Zayas,</i> 328 F.Supp.2d 202, 212 (D.P.R.2004) (citing <i>Consejo de Educaci&#243;n Superior de la U.P.R. v. Rosell&#243; Gonzalez,</i> 137 D.P.R. 83, 110 (1994)). The equal protection claim also founders, as it is a mere restatement of appellant's failed First Amendment claim. <i>See, e.g., N&#233;stor Col&#243;n Medina &amp; Sucesores, Inc. v. Custodio,</i> 964 F.2d 32, 45 (1st Cir.1992) (finding \"little basis or justification for applying equal protection analysis\" where Equal Protection claim overlapped with failed First Amendment claim). We therefore affirm on this issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Qualified Immunity</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The failure of appellant's constitutional claims obviates our need to address the qualified immunity defense: we have found no constitutional violation. <i>See Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office,</i> 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <i>Hope v. Pelzer,</i> 536 U.S. 730, 122 S.Ct. 2508, 153 L.Ed.2d 666 (2002); <i>Saucier v.

Job descriptions that are broad or open ended &#8212; given the employee's latitude to exercise discretionary judgment &#8212; generally indicate a policymaking position, while job descriptions that are narrowly circumscribed inhibit freedom of action and generally indicate a non-policymaking position. <i>Id.</i> The job title, however, is not necessarily dispositive in the inquiry, <i>Duriex-Gauthier,</i> 274 F.3d at 8. Instead, we examine other indicia including \"relative pay, technical competence, power to control others, authority to speak in the name of policymakers, public perception, influence on programs, contact with elected officials, ... responsiveness to partisan politics and political leaders ...

Her duties are broad and open-ended: \"[a]ny matter for the mayor referred to [her] regarding the [federal] programs.\" <i>Docket Document No. 52.</i> Moreover, Ruiz remained in continuous contact with the Mayor and the Director regarding the progress of projects, attended meetings, seminars, Housing and Development (HUD) orientation, and accomplished various tasks which demonstrate \"technical competence, power to control others, authority to speak in the name of policymakers, ... influence on programs, [and] contact with elected officials.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Jim&#233;nez Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 242. Furthermore, Ruiz's \"relative pay,\" another factor we consider, <i>see id.,</i> is only $100 less than the monthly salary of Director Camacho, whose position is indisputably a \"political\" trust position. We also note that when Camacho left the director office on October 9, 2001, Ruiz assumed the <i>de facto</i> position of director, assuming duties including the supervision of employees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Given Ruiz's broad-based responsibilities,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> as well as her close-working relationships with policymakers, we find that she occupied a \"political\" trust position, for which party affiliation is a requirement, <i>see Jim&#233;nez Fuentes,</i> 807 F.2d at 240.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant nonetheless attempts to salvage her claim by arguing that the Administrative Director position was labeled as a \"career\" position by a 1991 municipal ordinance.

The deposition testimony analyzed by the district court, however, merely recites the duties in appellant's official, written job description (Form OP-16).
