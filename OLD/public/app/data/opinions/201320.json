R. 32.3\n\n         United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 03-2013\n\n                     UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n                                Appellee,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                        JAMES MICHAEL COYNE,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n        ON REMAND FROM THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                     Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n          Tina Schneider on brief for appellant.\n          Joseph N.

After this court affirmed the sentence of\n\ndefendant-appellant James Michael Coyne, United States v. Coyne,\n\n114   Fed.     Appx.    5     (1st     Cir.   Nov.      3,     2004)    (per    curiam)\n\n(unpublished),        Coyne      petitioned      for    certiorari.         While     his\n\npetition was pending, the Supreme Court decided United States v.\n\nBooker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), and, in a routine order, granted\n\nthe petition for certiorari, vacated this court's judgment, and\n\nremanded for further consideration in light of Booker, Coyne v.\n\nUnited States, 125 S. Ct. 1088 (2005).                      We then allowed Coyne's\n\nrequest to file a supplemental brief and invited the government\n\nto file a supplemental brief as well.                        After reviewing those\n\nbriefs   and    the    underlying        record,       we    again     uphold   Coyne's\n\nsentence and reinstate our original judgment.\n\nANALYSIS\n\n             Coyne seeks a remand for resentencing under post-Booker\n\nstandards.      In support of that request, he argues, first, that\n\nthis court should reconsider United States v.                          Antonakopoulos,\n\n399 F.3d 68 (1st Cir. 2005), which places the burden on a\n\ndefendant raising an unpreserved Booker argument on appeal to\n\n\"point to circumstances creating a reasonable probability that\n\nthe   district    court       would     impose    a    different        sentence     more\n\nfavorable to the defendant under the new 'advisory Guidelines'\n\nBooker regime.\"         Id. at 75.            Second, Coyne argues, in the\n\nalternative,     that       he   has   satisfied       the     third    prong   of   the\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fAntonakopoulos plain-error standard for reviewing unpreserved\n\nBooker errors.1    Neither of those arguments is meritorious.\n\n          The first argument can be quickly disposed of. We have\n\nalready made clear that subsequent panels are bound to follow\n\nAntonakopoulos. See United States v. Villafane-Jimenez, 410 F.3d\n\n74, 85 (1st Cir. 2005) (per curiam); United States v. Bailey, 405\n\nF.3d 102, 114 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          Nor     has   Coyne   satisfied   his   burden   of   showing   a\n\n\"reasonable probability\" that the district court would have\n\nimposed a lower sentence had it realized that the Guidelines\n\ncould have been treated as advisory. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at\n\n75; see also United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st\n\nCir. 2005). To the contrary, comments by the sentencing judge on\n\nthe seriousness of Coyne's drug offense indicate that the judge\n\nwould likely have imposed the same sentence under an advisory\n\nGuidelines regime.      See United States v. Vega Molina, 407 F.3d\n\n511, 534 (1st Cir. 2005); United States v. McLean, 409 F.3d 492,\n\n505 (1st Cir. 2005).      Other indications that a lighter sentence\n\nwould have been improbable under advisory Guidelines are that the\n\njudge declined to exercise his discretion to depart downward\n\nbased on various mitigating factors argued by the defendant and\n\nimposed a harsher sentence than the government recommended.           See\n\n\n     1\n      It is undisputed that the alleged error--sentencing under\nmandatory Guidelines--was unpreserved and that defendant has\nsatisfied the first two prongs of the plain-error test.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fUnited States v. Luciano, 2005 WL 1594576, at *3 (1st Cir. July\n\n8, 2005).\n\n            The fact that the court sentenced Coyne to the bottom\n\nof the applicable Guideline range is not sufficient, in itself,\n\nto indicate a reasonable probability that the court would have\n\nimposed an even lower sentence if it had the discretion to do so.\n\nUnited States v. Kornegay, 410 F.3d 89, 99-100 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nAnd,   even   assuming,      without    deciding,   that   Coyne's   post-\n\nsentencing    conduct   as    an    allegedly   \"model   inmate\"   has   any\n\nrelevance here, such conduct would not likely result in a lighter\n\nsentence for the underlying offense.\n\n                                   CONCLUSION\n\n            For the above reasons, we again affirm the sentence,\n\nand order our earlier judgment reinstated.\n\nSo ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f",
