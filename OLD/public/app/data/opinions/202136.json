Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n               Selya, Lynch, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Roberto M. Braceras, with whom Christine M. Genaitis and\nGoodwin Procter LLP were on brief, for appellant.\n     Randall E. Kromm, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n                            April 7, 2006\n\f            LYNCH, Circuit Judge.      It is a crime for an alien to re-\n\nenter the country after he has been deported, unless he has the\n\nexpress permission of the Attorney General of the United States (or\n\nunless    such   permission   is   unnecessary    in   his   case   for   other\n\nreasons).    8 U.S.C. § 1326(a). The usual sentence for the crime is\n\na term in prison, followed by deportation.\n\n            Somewhat unusually in the criminal law, there is an\n\nexception provided by statute, id. § 1326(d), for aliens who can\n\nprove     that    the   original   deportation     order     was    based    on\n\nadministrative      proceedings    which   were    fundamentally      unfair.\n\nSubsection 1326(d) codifies these due process concerns, which were\n\noriginally set forth in United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, 481 U.S.\n\n828 (1987).      See United States v. Luna, 436 F.3d 312, 317 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).    The collateral attack on the deportation order pursuant to\n\n§ 1326(d) requires that the alien make three showings: that he has\n\nexhausted administrative remedies, that he was improperly deprived\n\nof the opportunity for judicial review, and that the deportation\n\norder was fundamentally unfair.\n\n            Rafael Garcia was convicted after a jury trial of the\n\ncrime of illegal re-entry and was sentenced on April 29, 2004 to 33\n\nmonths' imprisonment and two years of supervised release; he was\n\nreleased from prison on September 2, 2005, and was in immigration\n\ncustody awaiting deportation as of the close of briefing in this\n\nappeal.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f              His appeal turns largely on attacking rulings by the\n\ndistrict court denying his motion to dismiss the indictment under\n\n§   1326(d)    because       he   had    not   met   the     three    criteria    for    a\n\nsuccessful collateral attack, and denying dismissal on statute of\n\nlimitations grounds. He challenges jury findings that the criminal\n\nproceedings      were        brought     within      the    five-year      statute      of\n\nlimitations and that he re-entered the country without the express\n\nconsent of the Attorney General.               Although he has served his term\n\nof imprisonment, will be deported,1 and cannot re-enter the United\n\nStates   legally,       he    also      attacks   his      sentence   of   33    months'\n\nimprisonment plus supervised release.                      Finally, and with some\n\ncause, he complains about the delay of more than one year before\n\nthe district court provided him a transcript for appeal.\n\n              The one fact that permeates the analysis in this case,\n\nand that affects many of the issues, is that at the time of his\n\noriginal 1995 conviction for sale of crack cocaine and consequent\n\ndeportation, Garcia gave the false name of Dario DeLeon.                        He chose\n\nto hide from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)2 both\n\n\n1\n  In 1996, Congress replaced the statutory term \"deportation\" with\n\"removal.\" See Saint Fort v. Ashcroft, 329 F.3d 191, 197 (1st Cir.\n2003). For the sake of consistency, we use the term \"deportation\"\nthroughout this opinion.\n2\n   On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist and its principal\nfunctions were transferred to the Bureau of Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement in the Department of Homeland Security. See Homeland\nSecurity Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, § 471, 116 Stat. 2135,\n2205 (codified at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)). We refer to the agency as\nthe INS throughout.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fhis true identity and the fact that he had a green card in his true\n\nname (Rafael Garcia).       Indeed, he asked for a prompt deportation\n\nand took no appeal.       The district court found as a matter of fact\n\nthat this was a deliberate scheme of deception on his part so that\n\nhe could illegally re-enter the country by using his green card and\n\nhis real name.    This is exactly what he did a mere two months after\n\nhis deportation; he then lived in the United States for nearly\n\neight years as Rafael Garcia.          In March 2003, the government\n\nlearned for the first time that Rafael Garcia was the same person\n\nas the deported DeLeon and started these proceedings.\n\n          We     affirm   Garcia's   conviction   and   sentence   in   all\n\nrespects and note these key points in our holdings.            First, in\n\nperforming the collateral attack analysis under § 1326(d), the\n\ncourt ordinarily should address the initial test of exhaustion of\n\nadministrative remedies before going on to the other two tests.\n\nSecond, we address the situation where an alien claims that the\n\nstatute of limitations applicable to § 1326 prosecutions has run\n\nbut the government's lack of knowledge of the alien's presence is\n\na result of the alien's misrepresentations as to his identity.\n\nThird, we clarify and reinforce that a defendant who has been\n\ndelayed in resolution of his appeal by delay in preparation of the\n\ntrial transcript cannot establish a violation of due process absent\n\na showing of prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f                                 I.\n\n           The following facts are undisputed except where otherwise\n\nnoted.\n\nA.         Garcia's Initial Criminal Conviction and Deportation\n\n           Garcia, a native of the Dominican Republic, came to\n\nPuerto Rico in 1981 or 1982, when he was approximately twelve years\n\nold.   He obtained temporary permanent resident status in 1987 and\n\nlawful permanent resident status in 1990.       He later moved to\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n           In late February 1995, Garcia was arrested in Quincy,\n\nMassachusetts and charged with, among other things, selling crack\n\ncocaine to undercover officers.       Garcia, who was carrying no\n\nidentification, told the police his name was Dario DeLeon. He also\n\ngave a false birth date and lied about his father's name.\n\n           Garcia, who said he spoke no English, appeared at least\n\ntwice in Quincy District Court, accompanied both times by an\n\nattorney and at least once by an interpreter.       According to a\n\nnotation in the court records, Garcia was \"[a]dvised of right to\n\ncounsel\" and \"[a]dvised of alien rights.\"   He never told the judge\n\nor anyone else his real name.    On March 28, still under the name\n\nDeLeon, Garcia entered a plea to the drug charge3 and was sentenced\n\nto time served, thirty days' incarceration.\n\n\n3\n  The district court found that Garcia pled nolo contendere, while\nthe government says he pled guilty. The difference is immaterial\nto his appeal.\n\n                                -5-\n\f          Garcia was then transferred to the custody of the INS.\n\nThere he again identified himself as DeLeon and consistently denied\n\nhaving legal status.    He denied having a visa or a Social Security\n\nnumber and claimed to be unemployed.\n\n          The INS Order to Show Cause issued to Garcia (under the\n\nname of DeLeon), which was written in both English and Spanish,\n\ninformed him, among other things, that he could \"seek an attorney\n\nor representative, if [he] desire[d] to be represented.\"           It also\n\ninformed him that if he was not satisfied with the eventual\n\ndecision of the Immigration Judge (IJ), he had the right to appeal.\n\nGarcia signed a form (using the name DeLeon) which stated that the\n\nOrder to Show Cause had been read to him in Spanish.            Garcia also\n\nsigned (as DeLeon) a form that stated, in Spanish, that he was \"not\n\na citizen of the United States,\" that he \"d[id] not wish to apply\n\nfor relief from deportation,\" and that he \"want[ed] to be deported\n\nas soon as possible.\"    The form further stated: \"This request is\n\ncompletely voluntary.        I have not been coerced, threatened, or\n\nenticed in any way . . . .\"\n\n          Prior   to   his    appearance   before   the   IJ,   Garcia   was\n\nprovided with a \"Notice of Rights\" in Spanish.        The notice had two\n\nrelevant sections. The first, entitled \"Right to be Represented by\n\nan Attorney or Representative,\" stated:\n\n          If you have any questions regarding any of\n          your rights you can speak with an attorney or\n          representative who can explain your rights,\n          including any relief that may be available to\n\n                                   -6-\n\f           you from deportation.    The officer who gave\n           you this notice will give you a list of\n           organizations    that   can    provide   legal\n           information.     Representatives from these\n           organizations will speak to you for free or\n           for a small fee, and some of them might speak\n           your language. . . . You may contact a lawyer\n           or other legal representative at this time or\n           at any other time prior to your departure from\n           the United States.\n\nThe   second   section,   entitled    \"Right   to   a   Hearing   Before   an\n\nImmigration Judge,\" stated in relevant part:\n\n           If you do not want to return to your country,\n           you have a right to a hearing before an\n           immigration judge, who will determine whether\n           you can remain in the United States. If you\n           request a hearing, you may be represented at\n           the hearing by a lawyer or other legal\n           representative at your own expense.     If you\n           cannot afford to pay a lawyer, you may contact\n           an organization on the list of free legal\n           services. For example, if you are married to\n           a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, or have\n           lived in the U.S. for seven years or longer,\n           and have not been convicted of a serious\n           crime, you may be eligible for relief from\n           deportation.\n\n(emphasis in the original).     Garcia signed the bottom of the form\n\n(as DeLeon), indicating he had read it.\n\n           Garcia also received, as part of the Order to Show Cause,\n\na page of written information entitled \"Notice of Rights and\n\nConsequences.\"    It stated, in both English and Spanish: \"You will\n\nbe given a list of organizations, attorneys and other persons who\n\nhave indicated their availability to represent aliens in these\n\nproceedings.     Some of these persons may represent you free of\n\ncharge or for a nominal fee.\"    It noted that hearings before the IJ\n\n                                     -7-\n\fwere typically scheduled no sooner than fourteen days after the\n\nissuance of the Order to Show Cause \"to allow you to seek an\n\nattorney or representative, if you desire to be represented.\"\n\n           On April 26, 1995, Garcia appeared before an IJ in\n\nOakdale,   Louisiana.     A   court   interpreter    was     present.   The\n\nfollowing colloquy ensued:\n\n           IJ: Mr. DeLeon, sir, this is your first\n           appearance in my court, Immigration Court. As\n           such, you're entitled to delaying your case,\n           if you wish, to better prepare your case or to\n           acquire an attorney or we may go forward\n           today, whichever you desire.\n\n           Garcia: I cannot afford an attorney. I would\n           like to -- I would like to ask for\n           deportation.\n\n           IJ:   Do  you   understand      the      nature     of\n           Immigration Court, sir?\n\n           Garcia: Yes.\n\nAt that point Garcia took an oath to testify truthfully.                The\n\ncolloquy then continued:\n\n           IJ: Sir, do you understand that you have the\n           right to have an attorney represent you at no\n           expense to the government?\n\n           Garcia: Yes.\n\n           . . . .\n\n           IJ: And you understand, sir, that you have the\n           right to appeal any decision of this court to\n           a higher court in Washington, DC, and you do\n           that through the Federal Court system of this\n           country?\n\n           Garcia: Yes.\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f           IJ: Sir, do you acknowledge previous receipt\n           of the Form 6618, the legal aid sheet . . . as\n           well as your criminal conviction records?\n\n           Garcia: Yes.\n\n           Later, Garcia stated (still under oath) that he was not\n\na U.S. citizen or national and that he entered the United States in\n\n1990 without inspection.      The IJ found Garcia deportable.      The IJ\n\nasked the government attorney if he was \"aware of any relief\" from\n\ndeportation, to which the government replied: \"No, Your Honor.\"\n\nThe IJ ordered Garcia deported to the Dominican Republic. He asked\n\nGarcia: \"Do you wish to accept that decision or is there an\n\nappeal?\"   Garcia replied: \"I accept it.\"\n\nB.         Garcia's Re-entry and Second Conviction\n\n           Soon after Garcia's June 1995 deportation, his sister\n\nmailed his green card and passport from Massachusetts to him in the\n\nDominican Republic. Less than two months later, in late July 1995,\n\nGarcia used these documents to re-enter the United States via\n\nPuerto   Rico   under   his   real   name.4   He   did   not   inform   the\n\nimmigration officials that he had been deported as Dario DeLeon.\n\nAn immigration official checked Garcia's permanent resident card\n\nand then admitted him. Pursuant to standard practice at that time,\n\n\n\n\n4\n   Garcia states in his briefs that he re-entered the country in\nearly 1996, but immigration records show that the date was July 29,\n1995. The difference is immaterial to all questions on appeal,\nincluding the statute of limitations question. We refer to the re-\nentry date as 1995.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fhe did not take Garcia's fingerprints, nor did he check the prints\n\nalready on file for Garcia against any other database.\n\n            Garcia eventually moved back to Massachusetts, where he\n\nlived under his real name for several years.            In March 2003, Garcia\n\nargued with two people at a store in Massachusetts.             After he left\n\nthe store, he noticed that the two were following his car.                     He\n\ndecided to go to a police station.             The police asked him for\n\nidentification, which he provided (under his real name).                       The\n\npolice then arrested him on an outstanding warrant for operating an\n\nunregistered vehicle.        Garcia was fingerprinted, and the prints\n\nwere sent to the FBI for a check of the Bureau's database; at that\n\npoint, authorities realized that Garcia and \"DeLeon\" were one and\n\nthe same.\n\n            Garcia was charged with the federal crime of illegal re-\n\nentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326.          Before trial, he moved to\n\ndismiss   the   indictment    under    the   theories    that   (1)    the   1995\n\ndeportation proceeding violated his right to due process and was\n\ninvalid under § 1326(d), and (2) the indictment was untimely.                  The\n\ndistrict court rejected these contentions in a detailed order,\n\ndiscussed below.\n\n            After a four-day jury trial, Garcia was convicted.                 On\n\nApril 29, 2004, the district court sentenced him to 33 months'\n\nimprisonment    (with   credit   for    time   served)    and   24    months   of\n\nsupervised release.     Garcia completed his term of imprisonment on\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fSeptember 2, 2005, during the pendency of this appeal, and was\n\ntransferred to INS custody to await deportation.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           Garcia's primary argument on appeal is that the district\n\ncourt erred when it found that he failed to meet the collateral\n\nattack   standard   under   §   1326(d)   and   refused   to   dismiss   the\n\nindictment.\n\n           Subsection 1326(d) bars any collateral challenge to the\n\nunderlying deportation order unless the alien demonstrates the\n\nfollowing:\n\n           (1) the alien exhausted any administrative\n           remedies that may have been available to seek\n           relief against the order;\n           (2) the deportation proceedings at which the\n           order was issued improperly deprived the alien\n           of the opportunity for judicial review; and\n           (3) the entry of the order was fundamentally\n           unfair.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1326(d).    Here, the district court found that Garcia had\n\nnot met the third ground, in part because he could not show\n\nfundamental unfairness, as required under § 1326(d)(3).          See Luna,\n\n436 F.3d at 316.      We review the subsidiary factual findings for\n\nclear error and the ultimate mixed conclusion that there was no\n\nfundamental unfairness de novo.      See id. at 316-17.\n\n           Garcia argued before the district court that he was\n\ndenied the right to counsel during the 1995 deportation proceeding,\n\nand therefore that he met prongs (2) and (3) and that he was\n\nexcused from meeting prong (1).      He argued that he was illiterate\n\n                                   -11-\n\fin both English and Spanish in 1995, and so the notices informing\n\nhim of his rights meant little.         He also contended that when the IJ\n\ntold him he could obtain counsel and he replied, \"I cannot afford\n\nan attorney,\" the IJ was obligated to pursue the matter.                He stated\n\nthat he never received the legal aid sheet listing pro bono service\n\nproviders, and that his affirmative answer when the IJ asked him if\n\nhe had received the sheet was simply a product of his confusion.\n\n              Garcia also argued that he met the requirements of\n\n§ 1326(d) because he did not know he was eligible for relief from\n\ndeportation.     He contended that as a lawful permanent resident, he\n\nwould have been eligible for discretionary relief under former\n\n§§ 212(c) and 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; he\n\nsaid the government led him to believe he was not eligible for\n\nrelief, and that the IJ deprived him of his right to be informed\n\nabout potential relief by failing to mention it.\n\n              The district court rejected Garcia's collateral attack,\n\nfirst in a pretrial opinion and order and again after the verdict.\n\nThe   court    skipped   over    the    exhaustion         and   judicial   review\n\nrequirements of § 1326(d)(1) and (d)(2) and instead held that\n\nGarcia could not show, pursuant to § 1326(d)(3), that entry of the\n\n1995 deportation order was fundamentally unfair.                 This was so for\n\nseveral   reasons.       As     to   the      right   to    be   informed    about\n\ndiscretionary relief, the district court found that the IJ's\n\nfailure to mention it was entirely Garcia's fault: Garcia had lied\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fto the IJ and INS officials from the beginning, giving them a false\n\nname   and    telling   them    he     had    no   legal   status.    Under   the\n\ncircumstances, the court found, the IJ had no duty to tell Garcia\n\nabout discretionary relief, because the IJ had no way to know\n\nGarcia was eligible.5\n\n              As to the right to counsel, the court found that Garcia\n\nhad    been     \"notified      twice     in    writing     of   his   right   to\n\nrepresentation,\" that the IJ had informed him of his right to\n\nobtain counsel yet he had declined, and that he had told the IJ he\n\nreceived the legal aid sheet. In the post-verdict order, the court\n\nexplicitly found not credible Garcia's testimony during a pretrial\n\nmotion hearing that he had never received the legal aid sheet, and\n\nadded that even if he had not received it, that would not render\n\nthe proceedings unfair, because he told the IJ he had.                    As to\n\nGarcia's purported illiteracy, the district court wrote that it was\n\n\"certainly relevant to a due process inquiry\" but that \"it does not\n\nexcuse [Garcia's] failure to notify the immigration judge . . .\n\nthat he wanted help in finding an attorney or that he needed help\n\nin reading a list of lawyers.\"\n\n              Finally, and importantly, the district court concluded\n\nthat Garcia could not in any event demonstrate prejudice, as\n\n\n5\n   The court rejected Garcia's argument that the IJ and other INS\nofficials should have known, or did know, that Garcia was lying\nabout his identity and status. It found there was \"no evidence in\nthe record to support an inference of bad faith or even\nnegligence.\"\n\n                                        -13-\n\frequired under § 1326(d)(3), even if he had been denied access to\n\na list of available counsel.           This was because Garcia did not\n\nintend to avail himself of counsel, but rather intended all along\n\nto lie about his identity and be deported as quickly as possible so\n\nthat he could re-enter using his green card and real name.                The\n\ncourt found: \"The totality of Defendant's actions and statements\n\nindicates   that   he   wanted   his   true   identity   and    legal   status\n\nconcealed, rather than trumpeted.\"\n\n            On appeal, Garcia presents the broad argument that at his\n\ndeportation   hearing,    \"the   government    merely    went   through    the\n\nmotions and failed to give meaning to [his] rights.\"            He says this\n\nis because the IJ \"failed to determine whether Mr. Garcia wished to\n\nbe represented by counsel\" and \"failed to advise Mr. Garcia of his\n\nright to pro bono self-obtained counsel.\"          The brief also argues\n\nthat Garcia's rights were impinged because \"the INS failed to\n\nprovide Mr. Garcia with a list of legal aid counsel, as it was\n\nrequired to do, thus preventing Mr. Garcia from retaining counsel\n\nwho would have obtained § 212(c) relief from deportation.\"\n\n            These arguments are an attempt to ignore the district\n\ncourt's findings of fact.6        The district court explicitly found\n\n\n6\n   The brief, for example, entirely fails to inform us that the\ndistrict court found Garcia's use of the name DeLeon during the\noriginal deportation to be a deliberate scheme by Garcia to enhance\nhis prospects for later entry. The brief also asserts, based on\nGarcia's testimony, that he never received the legal aid sheet, and\nfails to inform us of the district court's finding that that\ntestimony was not credible. Counsel are not free, on appeal, to\n\n                                   -14-\n\fthat Garcia had been advised multiple times of his right to obtain\n\ncounsel during the immigration proceedings, that his testimony that\n\nhe never received the legal aid list was not credible, that he\n\nnever said he wanted a lawyer, and that he never requested time to\n\nfind a lawyer.      The court also found that it was quite unlikely\n\nGarcia wanted a lawyer; to further his scheme of fraudulent re-\n\nentry, he wanted to be quickly deported under the false name.\n\nThose    factual   findings    required      a   finding   that     Garcia   could\n\ndemonstrate neither prejudice nor fundamental unfairness.                       No\n\neffort is made to show that the findings are clearly erroneous.\n\n            Nonetheless,      we    have   given    Garcia    the    benefit    of\n\nreviewing the district court's findings against the evidence, and\n\nthere was no error at all.          The district court's ruling that the\n\nthird    precondition    for       collateral     attack     was    not   met   is\n\nunassailable.\n\n            We add that ordinarily, the § 1326(d) analysis should\n\nstart with the first ground, which the district court skipped\n\nover.7   Congress has mandated that \"an alien may not challenge the\n\n\n\nignore the district court's findings and argue the facts de novo,\neven if the ultimate conclusion of law drawn by the district court\nfrom the facts is subject to de novo review.\n7\n  While courts have some leeway in the structuring of opinions, it\nis quite clear that Congress has, particularly in the immigration\nlaws, placed a premium on exhaustion of agency remedies. In many\ncases, if there has been no such exhaustion by taking an appeal to\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals, a court would not consider the\npetitioner's claims.\n\n                                      -15-\n\fvalidity of the deportation order\" unless that alien \"exhausted any\n\nadministrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief\n\nagainst the order.\"     8 U.S.C. § 1326(d)(1) (emphasis added).           It is\n\nclear that appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) is such\n\nan administrative remedy, and that failure to take such an appeal\n\nconstitutes a failure of exhaustion.               See Sayyah v. Farquharson,\n\n382 F.3d 20, 27 (1st Cir. 2004).            It is also undisputed that Garcia\n\nexplicitly waived his right to appeal to the BIA when he asked to\n\nbe deported \"as soon as possible\" and subsequently told the IJ he\n\naccepted   the   decision        ordering    him   deported.    Barring   some\n\nexception to the exhaustion requirement, therefore, Garcia may not\n\nchallenge the deportation order's validity.\n\n           Garcia argues that just such an exception exists.                He\n\nrelies on cases from other courts which have concluded that the\n\n§ 1326(d)(1) exhaustion requirement \"cannot bar collateral review\n\nof a deportation proceeding when the waiver of [the] right to an\n\nadministrative appeal did not comport with due process,\" United\n\nStates v. Muro-Inclan, 249 F.3d 1180, 1183 (9th Cir. 2001), and\n\ntherefore that \"failure to exhaust administrative remedies bars\n\ncollateral   review     of   a    deportation      proceeding   under   Section\n\n1326(d)(1) . . . only where an alien's waiver of administrative\n\nreview was knowing and intelligent,\" United States v. Sosa, 387\n\nF.3d 131, 136 (2d Cir. 2004); see also Muro-Inclan, 249 F.3d at\n\n1183   (waiver   must   be   \"considered        and   intelligent\"   (internal\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fquotation marks omitted) (quoting United States v. Arrieta, 224\n\nF.3d 1076, 1079 (9th Cir. 2000))); United States v. Martinez-Rocha,\n\n337 F.3d 566, 569 (6th Cir. 2003).\n\n          Whether or not this court would create such an exception\n\nto the exhaustion requirement, a question on which we take no view,\n\nthe facts here preclude the argument.             Garcia was told at least\n\ntwice -- once when the Order to Show Cause was read to him, and\n\nagain by the IJ -- that he had the right to appeal.             He was asked\n\nagain by the IJ later in the proceeding whether he desired to\n\nappeal.   He   stated   that   he   did    not;   he   also   signed   a   form\n\nindicating that he did not wish to contest deportation. Given this\n\nrecord, Garcia's waiver was knowing and intelligent.              See United\n\nStates v. Johnson, 391 F.3d 67, 75 (2d Cir. 2004) (finding knowing\n\nwaiver where the IJ \"clearly advised\" the alien of his right to\n\nappeal); Martinez-Rocha, 337 F.3d at 569 (finding knowing waiver in\n\npart because the alien signed a form, read to him in Spanish,\n\nstating that he did not wish to contest the charges).           Further, the\n\ndistrict court found on ample evidence that Garcia never had any\n\nintention of appealing, because he wanted to be deported as quickly\n\nas possible so that he could re-enter under his real name.                 See\n\nMartinez-Rocha, 337 F.3d at 569 (finding of knowing waiver was\n\nsupported by an INS agent's testimony that the alien \"had expressed\n\na desire to return to Mexico as soon as possible\").\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\f           Garcia   argues   that   his    waiver   was   not   knowing   and\n\nintelligent because the IJ did not tell him he was eligible for\n\ndiscretionary relief and the government attorney \"affirmatively\n\ninformed [him] that he was not entitled to any discretionary\n\nrelief.\"   Again, the argument depends on ignoring the district\n\ncourt's factual findings.     It was Garcia's lies about his identity\n\nand his failure to disclose his green card status that hid his\n\npotential eligibility from the government and the IJ.8           He gets no\n\nreward for that.    Cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.49(a) (stating in the context\n\nof other forms of relief that the IJ \"shall inform the respondent\n\nof his or her apparent eligibility\") (emphasis added).\n\n           In sum, Garcia knew precisely what he was doing when he\n\ndecided to forgo an appeal of his 1995 deportation order; if there\n\nis an exception to the § 1326(d)(1) exhaustion requirement, he does\n\nnot fall within it.     His challenge to the 1995 deportation order\n\nfails.\n\n                                    III.\n\nA.         The Statute of Limitations\n\n           The crime of illegal re-entry is subject to a five-year\n\nstatute of limitations, 18 U.S.C. § 3282.             The district court\n\ndenied Garcia's pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment on\n\n\n8\n   In all events, as a factual matter, Garcia received and signed\nat least one form telling him that aliens with various types of\nstatus in the United States, such as those married to permanent\nresidents and those who had spent many years in the country, could\nbe eligible for relief.\n\n                                    -18-\n\flimitations grounds.         The issue also was submitted to the jury,\n\nwhich made a specific finding that the government had proved the\n\nindictment was timely.         We review the district court's pretrial\n\nruling de novo and the jury's finding for sufficiency of the\n\nevidence.     See United States v. Walsh, 928 F.2d 7, 12 (1st Cir.\n\n1991) (holding that district court did not err as a matter of law\n\nin refusing to dismiss an indictment where \"a jury could reasonably\n\nhave concluded\" on the evidence at trial that the limitations\n\nperiod had not run).\n\n            \"[A] deported alien who illegally reenters and remains in\n\nthe United States can violate [8 U.S.C. § 1326] at three different\n\npoints in time: when he 'enters, 'attempts to enter,' or when he\n\n'is at any time found in' this country.\"            United States v. Cuevas,\n\n75 F.3d 778, 784 (1st Cir. 1996) (quoting 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a)(2)).\n\nWhere an alien is indicted under the \"found in\" prong, as Garcia\n\nwas here, the alien is deemed to have committed the offense at the\n\nmoment he was \"found.\"       Id. (citing United States v. Rodriguez, 26\n\nF.3d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 1994)).\n\n            Garcia argues the government could have found out earlier\n\nthat he was illegally in the United States and that its lack of\n\ndiligence should be held against it.               The argument is based on\n\nlanguage from other courts in factually distinct cases to the\n\neffect   that   an   alien    is   \"found\"   for    §   1326   purposes   \"when\n\nimmigration     authorities     could   have,   through    the   exercise   of\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fdiligence typical of law enforcement authorities, discovered the\n\nviolation\" -- in other words, when they had constructive knowledge\n\nthat the alien was in the country illegally.   See United States v.\n\nGomez, 38 F.3d 1031, 1037 (8th Cir. 1994); see also United States\n\nv. Herrera-Ordones, 190 F.3d 504, 510 (7th Cir. 1999).      Garcia\n\nargues that the jury was compelled to find that the government had\n\nthe requisite constructive knowledge as soon as he re-entered the\n\ncountry, and so the limitations period ran several years before his\n\n2003 indictment.   This, he says, is because diligent immigration\n\nauthorities would have realized at the time of his 1995 re-entry\n\nthat he and \"DeLeon\" were the same person.\n\n          The district court, in considering Garcia's motion to\n\ndismiss, accepted the existence of this constructive knowledge\n\ntheory for purposes of analysis.   It examined pre-trial affidavits\n\nand other evidence submitted by the government which stated that\n\nimmigration procedures in place in 1995 did not involve checking\n\nthe fingerprints of arriving green card holders like Garcia against\n\nany database of criminals or of past deportees. The district court\n\nfound that based on this evidence, and on the fact that Garcia lied\n\nabout his identity during the deportation process, it could not say\n\nas a matter of law that immigration officials exercising ordinary\n\ndiligence should have known at the time of Garcia's re-entry that\n\nhe previously had been deported.\n\n\n\n\n                               -20-\n\f            We approach the question differently.         This court has\n\nnever adopted the theory that the government may be charged with\n\nconstructive knowledge of an alien's illegal re-entry for purposes\n\nof § 1326, and there are certainly good arguments against the\n\ntheory in this context.        We do not, however, resolve the broad\n\nquestion of whether constructive knowledge can be attributed to the\n\ngovernment.    We hold more narrowly that for statute of limitations\n\npurposes in § 1326 prosecutions, there can be no finding of lack of\n\ndiligence where it is deception by the alien as to his identity\n\nthat has caused the government not to have knowledge of his\n\npresence.    To hold otherwise would be to reward deceit by the alien\n\nand   to   encourage   the   withholding   of   information,   and   so   the\n\ncorruption of the deportation process.9            Cf. United States v.\n\nMercedes, 287 F.3d 47, 55 (2d Cir. 2002) (\"[I]t is difficult not to\n\nfind Mercedes's claim regarding the delay disingenuous when he was\n\nthe one who attempted to deceive law enforcement officials by\n\nconcealing his true identity\"). In any event, the facts before the\n\ndistrict court prior to trial showed that the government could not,\n\nin the ordinary course, have discovered the deception, and so there\n\nwould be no basis for a constructive knowledge claim even if one\n\nwere cognizable.\n\n\n9\n   Garcia relies on Gomez, 38 F.3d 1031, for the conclusion that\nthe constructive knowledge rule should apply even where an alien's\ndeception prevented immigration officials from learning his true\nidentity. To the extent Gomez can be read to so hold, we reject\nit.\n\n                                   -21-\n\f            Finally, any claim that there was insufficient evidence\n\nto support the jury's finding of timeliness fails.    The government\n\nintroduced evidence at trial to the effect that it did not know\n\nGarcia had illegally re-entered the country until he was arrested\n\nin 2003; this evidence was uncontradicted.       The jury had ample\n\nbasis to find that it was not a lack of diligence by the government\n\nthat resulted in the timing of the indictment in this case.\n\nB.          Consent to Re-enter\n\n            Garcia next argues the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport the jury's conclusion that he lacked the Attorney General's\n\nconsent to re-enter the country.     \"In reviewing such a challenge,\n\nwe consider the record evidence (and any reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom) as a whole and in the light most favorable to the\n\nprosecution, asking whether the evidence would have permitted a\n\nrational jury to find the defendants guilty of the crime charged\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\" United States v. Downs-Moses, 329 F.3d\n\n253, 261 (1st Cir. 2003).         \"'[T]he evidence may be entirely\n\ncircumstantial, and need not exclude every hypothesis of innocence\n\n. . . .'\"    United States v. Meléndez-Torres, 420 F.3d 45, 49 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Scantleberry-Frank, 158 F.3d 612, 616 (1st Cir. 1998)).\n\n            To convict Garcia of violating 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a), the\n\njury must have found that the government proved beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt that Garcia was an alien, that he had been deported, that he\n\n\n                                  -22-\n\fentered or attempted to enter or was later found in the United\n\nStates, and that he did so \"without the express consent of the\n\nAttorney General for such entry.\"            Id. (citing Scantleberry-Frank,\n\n158 F.3d at 616); see 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a).           At trial, the government\n\npresented    evidence     as     to    the    \"express    consent\"     prong   --\n\nspecifically, a Certificate of Nonexistence of Record stating that\n\nno such consent appeared in the INS A-File10 on \"Dario DeLeon.\"\n\nGarcia argues that since the INS kept a separate A-File on \"Rafael\n\nGarcia,\"    the   jury   could   not    convict   absent    evidence    that   no\n\nindication of consent appeared in the Rafael Garcia file either.\n\nSince the government produced no such evidence, he says, it failed\n\nto carry its burden.\n\n            This argument is without merit. Garcia's own lies led to\n\nhis deportation under the name DeLeon.                   If he had requested\n\npermission to re-enter after deportation, he would have had to do\n\nso as DeLeon (otherwise the request would have made no sense to the\n\nimmigration authorities) and any such permission logically would be\n\nin the \"DeLeon\" file.       Further, as the district court found, the\n\nevidence supports the conclusion that Garcia schemed to be deported\n\nunder a false name so he could immediately re-enter using his real\n\nidentity.    A jury could reasonably infer that Garcia never would\n\nhave requested permission (under any name) to re-enter, since such\n\n\n\n10\n    An INS A-File \"records every contact an alien has with the\nimmigration service.\" Meléndez-Torres, 420 F.3d at 47.\n\n                                       -23-\n\fa request would have alerted the INS to his deception.   In short,\n\nthe evidence is more than sufficient to sustain the jury verdict.\n\n          Garcia falls back to an argument that he in fact had\n\nexpress permission to re-enter the country because he did so using\n\nhis green card, which was issued by the Attorney General and which\n\nhe says constitutes the requisite permission.     As the district\n\ncourt said: \"Under defendant's interpretation of the statute, he\n\ncan lie about his identity . . . and then re-enter with impunity\n\nusing a green card under his real name.      This would obviously\n\nfrustrate the statutory purpose of keeping previously-deported\n\naliens from reentering the country without the Attorney General's\n\n'express' prior permission.\"     Garcia had just been deported,\n\nregardless of what name he was using at the time, and he therefore\n\nneeded the Attorney General's contemporaneous permission before he\n\ncould legally re-enter.   8 U.S.C. § 1326(a).   If Garcia had been\n\ndeported under his real name, his green card likely would have been\n\nrevoked, and in any event obviously would not constitute such\n\npermission.11 He can gain no advantage from having deceived the INS\n\nabout his identity.\n\n\n\n11\n   Garcia cites a case, United States v. Idowu, 105 F.3d 728 (D.C.\nCir. 1997), for the proposition that even an invalid green card is\nenough to constitute Attorney General consent. The Idowu court\nheld no such thing. It said only that the defendant alien might\nnot have needed consent at all because more than five years had\npassed since his deportation; because the crucial question involved\npassage of time, the court noted that the validity or invalidity of\nhis arrival documents was irrelevant to its analysis. Id. at 731.\n\n                               -24-\n\fC.         The Almendarez-Torres Issue\n\n           Garcia argues that his conviction must be vacated because\n\nthe district court did not submit to the jury the question of his\n\nunderlying 1995 drug conviction. He argues that the district court\n\nwas required to do so because Almendarez-Torres v. United States,\n\n523 U.S. 224 (1998), in which the Supreme Court held that the prior\n\nconviction is a mere sentencing factor for § 1326(b) purposes, id.\n\nat 235, has been overruled by subsequent case law.             He relies on\n\nJustice Thomas' concurrence in Shepard v. United States, 125 S.Ct.\n\n1254 (2005), which stated that in light of Apprendi v. New Jersey,\n\n530 U.S. 466 (2000), and subsequent Sixth Amendment jurisprudence,\n\n\"a majority of the Court now recognizes that Almendarez-Torres was\n\nwrongly   decided.\"     Shepard,   125    S.Ct.    at   1264   (Thomas,    J.,\n\nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment).\n\n           As an initial matter, we note that Garcia seems to be\n\nmixing apples and oranges in challenging his conviction on this\n\nbasis.    The cases upon which he relies largely go to whether a\n\njudge may consider a prior conviction for sentencing purposes when\n\nthat conviction has not been found by a jury beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.    See   id.   (\"Innumerable   criminal      defendants    have    been\n\nunconstitutionally     sentenced      under       the   flawed    rule     of\n\nAlmendarez-Torres . . . .\") (emphasis added).            Perhaps Garcia is\n\nmaking a sentencing argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -25-\n\f           Either way, however, Garcia's argument fails.                  Garcia\n\nstipulated to the prior conviction at trial: his counsel not only\n\naffirmatively told the jury about the fact of a prior conviction\n\nand agreed to the entry into evidence of a redacted record of the\n\nconviction, but also argued prior to trial that \"evidence of [the]\n\nconviction is wholly irrelevant to [Garcia's] charged illegal\n\nreentry offense and has the potential to prejudice Mr. Garcia\n\nunfairly.\"     Garcia has waived any argument that the jury needed to\n\nfind the fact of conviction beyond a reasonable doubt. See Blakely\n\nv. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 310 (2004) (\"[A] defendant who stands\n\ntrial    may   consent   to    judicial      factfinding     as    to   sentence\n\nenhancements,    which   may   well    be    in   his   interest   if   relevant\n\nevidence would prejudice him at trial.\"); see also United States v.\n\nGlover, 413 F.3d 1206, 1208 (10th Cir. 2005) (\"In regard to\n\nsentencing, a defendant may waive his Sixth Amendment rights under\n\nApprendi and Blakely by stipulating to facts underlying sentence\n\nenhancements.\") (citing Blakely, 542 U.S. at 310).\n\n           Further, even had Garcia not waived the issue, his\n\nprecise argument has already been rejected by a panel of this\n\ncourt.    United States v. Ivery, 427 F.3d 69, 75 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nIn Ivery, the court noted that the Supreme Court has taken care to\n\nreaffirm the \"prior conviction\" exception of Almendarez-Torres in\n\nall of its recent Sixth Amendment jurisprudence, and that even the\n\nShepard majority cautioned that it \"is up to the future to show\"\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\fwhether Apprendi eventually will be extended to require proof of\n\nprior   convictions        to   a     jury.      Id.       (internal     quotation       marks\n\nomitted) (quoting Shepard, 125 S.Ct. at 1263 n.5). The Ivery panel\n\nconcluded: \"It is not our place to anticipate the Supreme Court's\n\nreconsideration       of    its       prior    rulings;       thus     Almendarez-Torres\n\nremains binding law that we must apply until overruled by a\n\nmajority of the Supreme Court.\"                      Id.    We in turn are bound by\n\nIvery's holding.\n\nD.          Booker Issue As to Garcia's Term of Supervised Release\n\n            Garcia has now served the imprisonment portion of his\n\nsentence and is subject to a two-year term of supervised release,\n\nbut   is   in   the   hands      of    immigration          authorities     and    awaiting\n\ndeportation, if he has not yet been deported.                          Nonetheless, in a\n\nlong footnote in his brief on appeal, Garcia says he is entitled to\n\nbe resentenced, presumably to alter the sentence of supervised\n\nrelease.\n\n            Garcia     was      sentenced       under       the   mandatory     Guidelines\n\nscheme in place prior to United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220\n\n(2005). He concedes that his Booker claim was not preserved in the\n\ndistrict court, but says he meets the \"reasonable probability\"\n\nstandard this court requires under plain-error Booker review,\n\nUnited States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005),\n\nbecause the district judge sentenced him at the bottom of the\n\napplicable      Guidelines          range     and     stated      that    his     case     was\n\n\n                                              -27-\n\fsympathetic. The government argues that we cannot reach the Booker\n\nissue because it is moot.\n\n             It is well-settled that a convict's claim is not moot if\n\nhe has finished his prison term but still faces supervised release\n\nor a restitution order, so long as those conditions give him \"a\n\ncontinuing stake in the outcome of a challenge\" to the sentence.\n\nUnited States v. Molak, 276 F.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 2002); see also\n\nUnited States v. Prochner, 417 F.3d 54, 59 n.4 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n             The    government      argues       that    the    supervised       release\n\nsentencing issue is moot on these facts.                       The argument is that\n\nGarcia,    who     is    in   immigration        custody       and    facing    imminent\n\ndeportation from the United States, will never be subject to the\n\nsupervised release portion of his sentence.                    The government argues\n\nthat the possibility that Garcia could one day return to the United\n\nStates does not change the analysis.                    This is because Garcia is\n\ninadmissible as a result of his 1995 cocaine conviction, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§    1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II),          and      ineligible         for    a     waiver     of\n\ninadmissibility, id. § 1182(h)(2). Therefore, Garcia could only be\n\nin   the   United       States,   and   potentially        subject      to     supervised\n\nrelease, if he broke the law to get here; this will not suffice,\n\nthe government argues, because a stake in the outcome of a case\n\nwill   not    create       standing     if   it    is     \"contingent        upon     [the\n\ndefendant's] violating the law\" in the future.                       Spencer v. Kemna,\n\n523 U.S. 1, 15 (1998).\n\n\n                                          -28-\n\f               There   is      some   case    law   supporting    the   government's\n\ntheory.    See Okereke v. United States, 307 F.3d 117, 121 (3d Cir.\n\n2002) (finding alien's sentencing appeal moot where alien had been\n\nremoved and could not legally reenter, and resentencing \"would not\n\nprovide [him] with the tangible benefit of reentry\"); United States\n\nv. Mercurris, 192 F.3d 290, 294 (2d Cir. 1999) (finding moot a\n\ndeported alien's claim that the district court erroneously deemed\n\nhis crimes \"aggravated felonies\" because the alien \"ha[d] only a\n\nquixotic chance of legally returning to the United States\" and \"the\n\npossibility       that      his   aggravated        felon   status   could   make   a\n\ndifference to him . . . is too speculative to create an Article III\n\ncase or controversy\").            Defendant has not, in response, identified\n\nany practical impact on him of the Booker supervised release issue.\n\nIf there is one, it is not up to the appellate court to try to\n\nguess what it is.           Without adopting a general rule, we hold that\n\nany Booker issue in this case is moot.\n\nE.             The Transcript Delay\n\n               A disturbing aspect of this case is the fourteen-month\n\nperiod    it    took     for    the   court    reporter     to   produce   the   trial\n\ntranscripts for appeal. Unfortunately, this is a recurring problem\n\nin some districts within the circuit, and not a new one.                         See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Pratt, 645 F.2d 89, 91 (1st Cir. 1981)\n\n(nine-month delay in preparing a transcript).\n\n\n\n\n                                             -29-\n\f             Garcia filed a Notice of Appeal on April 30, 2004.               On\n\nJune   8,   2004,   this    court   ordered   the   district     court's   court\n\nreporter to file, by August 9 of that year, transcripts of Garcia's\n\ntrial and related proceedings.\n\n             The period of time until the transcript was prepared was\n\na shared responsibility of this court, the district court, and\n\nGarcia. The court reporter was granted several extensions, without\n\nobjection, which pushed the deadline back to November 1.              When the\n\ntranscript was not prepared by that date, this court issued an\n\nOrder to Show Cause directing production of the transcripts by\n\nNovember 22.    Several more rounds of orders and extension requests\n\nfollowed.\n\n             On August 11, 2005, some fourteen months after the Notice\n\nof Appeal, Garcia first moved to compel production.                 This court\n\ngranted the motion, and the transcripts were finally filed on\n\nAugust 19, 2005.     Garcia says this delay violated his due process\n\nright to a timely appeal, and that the remedy must be reversal of\n\nhis conviction.      The prosecution, which is of course not actually\n\nresponsible for the transcript delay, is nonetheless deemed to be\n\nresponsible, as the government candidly admits.\n\n             The concern is where delay in the appeal due to a tardy\n\ntranscript may violate the due process rights of the defendant.\n\n\"[E]xtreme delay in the processing of an appeal may amount to a due\n\nprocess     violation,     and   delays   caused    by   court   reporters   are\n\n\n                                      -30-\n\fattributable to the government for purposes of determining whether\n\na defendant has been deprived of due process . . . .\"                 United\n\nStates v. Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d 1142, 1158 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(citing United States v. Wilson, 16 F.3d 1027, 1030 (9th Cir.\n\n1994)).   However, \"mere delay, in and of itself will not give rise\n\nto a due process infraction.       The defendant must show prejudice.\"\n\nId.\n\n           Furthermore, as the Supreme Court has said in the context\n\nof pre-indictment delay, even proof of actual prejudice does not\n\nmake a due process claim \"automatically valid.\"            United States v.\n\nLovasco, 431 U.S. 783, 789 (1977).           The court \"must consider the\n\nreasons for the delay as well as the prejudice to the [defendant].\"\n\nId. at 790.    The showing of prejudice is therefore a threshold\n\nrequirement.   See id.; see also Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d at 1158.\n\nThe   prejudice   must   be    such     as   to   render   the   proceedings\n\n\"fundamentally unfair.\"       Lovasco, 431 U.S. at 796.\n\n           The question of what constitutes prejudice is one on\n\nwhich the circuits have differing views.           Garcia has, relying on\n\ncase law from elsewhere, argued that certain effects of delay\n\nconstitute prejudice.    We reject the arguments.          Based on what is\n\nproperly cognizable as prejudice, we hold that Garcia has not made\n\nhis threshold prejudice showing.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\f            i.         Cognizable Forms of Prejudice\n\n            We have recognized two forms of possible prejudice.                It\n\nis possible for delay to so impair a defendant's ability to present\n\nhis   appeal      as   to      create   prejudice   to   the   appeal    itself.\n\nLuciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d at 1158.             It also is possible that even\n\nwhere a defendant wins his appeal, the delay in preparing the\n\ntranscripts on appeal could have prejudiced his right to make his\n\ncase on retrial.         Id.\n\n            We see no impairment of Garcia’s ability to present his\n\nappeal.     He was and has been present in this country and has had\n\naccess to counsel.12           When we look as well at the substance of the\n\narguments    he    has    presented     on   appeal,   the   failure    of   those\n\narguments has not in any way been caused by the delay.                  Since he\n\nhas lost his appeal there can be no impairment of his rights on\n\nretrial.\n\n            To the extent Garcia argues that any particular period -–\n\nhere, a one-year delay from the original due date of the transcript\n\n\n\n12\n     According to his reply brief, Garcia was still awaiting\ndeportation as of December 29, 2005, six weeks prior to oral\nargument. We do not know whether his deportation has been delayed\nbecause of his appeal.     We presume it has not, however, since\nGarcia did not request a stay of deportation from this court, and\nabsent such a stay the government may deport an alien during the\npendency of an appeal. See Neverson v. Farquharson, 366 F.3d 32,\n38 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"The INS immediately took Neverson into custody\nand prepared to deport him . . . . On Neverson's emergency motion,\nthis court issued a provisional stay . . . barring the INS from\ndeporting Neverson until we could hear and decide his case.\").\nGarcia suggests as much in his reply brief.\n\n                                        -32-\n\f–- per se amounts to a due process violation, we reject the\n\nargument.         This circuit's requirement is that the defendant must\n\nshow prejudice, and we will not presume prejudice from the length\n\nof the delay.        See Luciano-Mosquera, 63 F.3d at 1158; see also id.\n\nat   1158     &     n.8   (describing       approximately    two-year    delay   in\n\nfurnishing transcripts as \"appalling\" but rejecting defendant's\n\nclaim for lack of prejudice); Pratt, 645 F.2d at 91 (declining to\n\nhold a nine-month delay unconstitutional, \"at least in the absence\n\nof exacerbating factors\").             There can be no per se rules on the\n\nlength   of       delay    because   this    court,   in   the   exercise   of   its\n\nsupervisory authority, is bound by the rule that a showing of\n\nprejudice is ordinarily needed for due process claims.                  See United\n\nStates v. Tucker, 8 F.3d 673, 676 (9th Cir. 1993) (en banc) (\"[A]\n\nfederal court may not exercise its supervisory powers to reverse a\n\nconviction absent a showing of prejudice.\").\n\n              ii.         Garcia's Other Arguments\n\n              Garcia also argues that he was prejudiced in ways which,\n\nin our view, are simply not cognizable on a due process claim in\n\nthis context.         Specifically, he argues that due to the delay, he\n\nhas suffered anxiety and \"oppressive incarceration\" during the\n\npendency of his appeal.              He bases this argument on decisions by\n\nother courts which have drawn an analogy between the right to a\n\ntimely appeal and the right to a speedy trial.                   See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Hawkins, 78 F.3d 348, 350 (8th Cir. 1996); United States\n\n\n                                         -33-\n\fv. Mohawk, 20 F.3d 1480, 1486 (9th Cir. 1994); Rheuark v. Shaw, 628\n\nF.2d 297, 303 (5th Cir. 1980).    We reject the argument and differ\n\nfrom these courts.   We explain why.\n\n           A due process claim about delays on appeal is not the\n\nsame as a Sixth Amendment speedy trial claim.   In Barker v. Wingo,\n\n407 U.S. 514 (1972), a case under the Sixth Amendment, the Supreme\n\nCourt identified four criteria, of which prejudice is only one, to\n\ndetermine when the right to a speedy trial is violated.      Id. at\n\n530.   The Court held that it is possible to have a violation of the\n\nspeedy trial right without a specific showing of prejudice. Id. at\n\n533.   By contrast, there is no Sixth Amendment speedy trial claim\n\nto be made as to appeals, with the possible exception, not involved\n\nhere, of interlocutory appeals.    See United States v. Loud Hawk,\n\n474 U.S. 302, 313-17 (1986); see also United States v. Smith, 94\n\nF.3d 204, 206 (6th Cir. 1996) (\"The speedy trial guarantee of the\n\nSixth Amendment applies only to proceedings in the trial court.\").\n\nThe right of appeal is statutory, and the grant is subject to due\n\nprocess requirements.    Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.S. 387, 393 (1985).\n\n           In Barker, three categories of potential prejudice were\n\nidentified: oppressive pretrial incarceration, anxiety and concern\n\nof the accused, and the possibility that the accused's defense\n\nmight be impaired.      407 U.S. at 532.    Those courts that have\n\naccepted the analogy between pretrial delay and appellate delay\n\nhave adopted this inquiry almost whole cloth and looked for three\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\fkinds of potential prejudice from appellate delay: \"(1) oppressive\n\nincarceration pending appeal, (2) anxiety and concern of the\n\nconvicted   party   awaiting     the    outcome   of   the   appeal,   and    (3)\n\nimpairment of the convicted person's grounds for appeal or of the\n\nviability of his defense in case of retrial.\"            Hawkins, 78 F.3d at\n\n351 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Tucker, 8 F.3d at\n\n646); see also Rheuark, 628 F.2d at 303 n.8.\n\n            In our view, the due process issues caused by delay on\n\nappeal are more limited than those resulting from delay in the\n\ntrial court.      Cf. Ross v. Moffitt, 417 U.S. 600, 610 (1974)\n\n(noting, in the context of due process requirements, that \"there\n\nare significant differences between the trial and appellate stages\n\nof a criminal proceeding\").       And so we reject, at least in cases of\n\ndelayed transcripts on appeal, the direct analogy made to tests\n\ninvolving the Sixth Amendment speedy trial right, which underlies\n\nthe so-often articulated three-factor prejudice test quoted above.\n\nOther   courts   have   shared   this    concern.      See,   e.g.,    Cody    v.\n\nHenderson, 936 F.2d 715, 719 (2d Cir. 1991) (\"Certainly, the\n\ndifferences in a defendant's situation before trial and after\n\nconviction suggest that at the very least the Barker factors should\n\nnot be applied uncritically.\"); see also Arkin, Speedy Criminal\n\nAppeal: A Right Without A Remedy, 74 Minn. L. Rev. 437, 473-81\n\n(1990) (concluding that the concerns of Barker, and the Barker\n\ntest, do not translate to the appellate delay setting).\n\n\n                                       -35-\n\f           The first two of the adopted Barker prejudice factors\n\nhave little rationale in the appellate context.                  A defendant who\n\nhas been convicted of a crime no longer enjoys a presumption of\n\ninnocence, Herrera v. Collins, 506 U.S. 390, 399 (1993), and so his\n\nincarceration      pending     appeal    cannot     itself      be    said   to   be\n\n\"oppressive.\"       Further,     there    are     other   remedies       concerning\n\nconditions of confinement.           The appellant may or may not meet the\n\nrequirements      for   bail    on    appeal.13      If    the       conditions   of\n\nincarceration raise Eighth Amendment concerns, habeas corpus is\n\navailable.      Similarly, while any defendant who has been convicted\n\nof a crime may experience anxiety during the pendency of the\n\nappeal, this consideration is not useful to evaluating prejudice\n\nfor due process purposes.\n\n           Because Garcia has not shown prejudice, we do not reach\n\nthe   reasons    for    the    delay.     Sometimes       the    reasons     involve\n\ninadequate resources in the reporting services available to the\n\ndistrict court, or overly busy court reporters; sometimes there are\n\n\n\n13\n   Indeed, delay in the appeals process may itself strengthen an\nappellant's case for having met those requirements, so long as that\ndelay is not attributable to the appellant. See, e.g., Leigh v.\nUnited States, 82 S.Ct. 994, 997 (1962) (Warren, Circuit Justice)\n(granting bail where \"th[e] appeal is not frivolous, . . . such\ndelays as have occurred can hardly be attributed to applicant . . .\n[and] [t]he Government does not contend that there is a likelihood\nthat applicant will flee the jurisdiction.\"); United States v.\nBentvena, 308 F.2d 47, 48 (2d Cir. 1962) (rejecting bail but noting\nthat \"[i]f for any reason there are delays in the hearing of these\nappeals for which the appellants are not responsible these motions\nmay be renewed.\").\n\n                                        -36-\n\fother reasons.   The problem of delay in production of transcripts\n\nis a very serious one, but one which cannot be used to benefit a\n\ndefendant absent a showing of prejudice.\n\n                                IV.\n\n          Garcia's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -37-\n\f",

The usual sentence for the crime is\n\na term in prison, followed by deportation.\n\n            Somewhat unusually in the criminal law, there is an\n\nexception provided by statute, id. § 1326(d), for aliens who can\n\nprove     that    the   original   deportation     order     was    based    on\n\nadministrative      proceedings    which   were    fundamentally      unfair.\n\nSubsection 1326(d) codifies these due process concerns, which were\n\noriginally set forth in United States v. Mendoza-Lopez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111894\"><a href=\"/opinion/111894/united-states-v-mendoza-lopez/\"><span class=\"volume\">481</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">828</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1987).

The collateral attack on the deportation order pursuant to\n\n§ 1326(d) requires that the alien make three showings: that he has\n\nexhausted administrative remedies, that he was improperly deprived\n\nof the opportunity for judicial review, and that the deportation\n\norder was fundamentally unfair.\n\n            Rafael Garcia was convicted after a jury trial of the\n\ncrime of illegal re-entry and was sentenced on April 29, 2004 to 33\n\nmonths' imprisonment and two years of supervised release; he was\n\nreleased from prison on September 2, 2005, and was in immigration\n\ncustody awaiting deportation as of the close of briefing in this\n\nappeal.\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f              His appeal turns largely on attacking rulings by the\n\ndistrict court denying his motion to dismiss the indictment under\n\n§   1326(d)    because       he   had    not   met   the     three    criteria    for    a\n\nsuccessful collateral attack, and denying dismissal on statute of\n\nlimitations grounds. He challenges jury findings that the criminal\n\nproceedings      were        brought     within      the    five-year      statute      of\n\nlimitations and that he re-entered the country without the express\n\nconsent of the Attorney General.               Although he has served his term\n\nof imprisonment, will be deported,1 and cannot re-enter the United\n\nStates   legally,       he    also      attacks   his      sentence   of   33    months'\n\nimprisonment plus supervised release.                      Finally, and with some\n\ncause, he complains about the delay of more than one year before\n\nthe district court provided him a transcript for appeal.\n\n              The one fact that permeates the analysis in this case,\n\nand that affects many of the issues, is that at the time of his\n\noriginal 1995 conviction for sale of crack cocaine and consequent\n\ndeportation, Garcia gave the false name of Dario DeLeon.                        He chose\n\nto hide from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)2 both\n\n\n1\n  In 1996, Congress replaced the statutory term \"deportation\" with\n\"removal.\" See Saint Fort v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200461\"><a href=\"/opinion/200461/saint-fort-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">191</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 197 (1st Cir.\n2003). For the sake of consistency, we use the term \"deportation\"\nthroughout this opinion.\n2\n   On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist and its principal\nfunctions were transferred to the Bureau of Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement in the Department of Homeland Security. See Homeland\nSecurity Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, § 471, 116 Stat. 2135,\n2205 (codified at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)). We refer to the agency as\nthe INS throughout.\n\n                                           -3-\n\fhis true identity and the fact that he had a green card in his true\n\nname (Rafael Garcia).       Indeed, he asked for a prompt deportation\n\nand took no appeal.       The district court found as a matter of fact\n\nthat this was a deliberate scheme of deception on his part so that\n\nhe could illegally re-enter the country by using his green card and\n\nhis real name.    This is exactly what he did a mere two months after\n\nhis deportation; he then lived in the United States for nearly\n\neight years as Rafael Garcia.          In March 2003, the government\n\nlearned for the first time that Rafael Garcia was the same person\n\nas the deported DeLeon and started these proceedings.\n\n          We     affirm   Garcia's   conviction   and   sentence   in   all\n\nrespects and note these key points in our holdings.            First, in\n\nperforming the collateral attack analysis under § 1326(d), the\n\ncourt ordinarily should address the initial test of exhaustion of\n\nadministrative remedies before going on to the other two tests.\n\nSecond, we address the situation where an alien claims that the\n\nstatute of limitations applicable to § 1326 prosecutions has run\n\nbut the government's lack of knowledge of the alien's presence is\n\na result of the alien's misrepresentations as to his identity.\n\nThird, we clarify and reinforce that a defendant who has been\n\ndelayed in resolution of his appeal by delay in preparation of the\n\ntrial transcript cannot establish a violation of due process absent\n\na showing of prejudice.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\f                                 I.\n\n           The following facts are undisputed except where otherwise\n\nnoted.\n\nA.         Garcia's Initial Criminal Conviction and Deportation\n\n           Garcia, a native of the Dominican Republic, came to\n\nPuerto Rico in 1981 or 1982, when he was approximately twelve years\n\nold.   He obtained temporary permanent resident status in 1987 and\n\nlawful permanent resident status in 1990.       He later moved to\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n           In late February 1995, Garcia was arrested in Quincy,\n\nMassachusetts and charged with, among other things, selling crack\n\ncocaine to undercover officers.       Garcia, who was carrying no\n\nidentification, told the police his name was Dario DeLeon. He also\n\ngave a false birth date and lied about his father's name.\n\n           Garcia, who said he spoke no English, appeared at least\n\ntwice in Quincy District Court, accompanied both times by an\n\nattorney and at least once by an interpreter.       According to a\n\nnotation in the court records, Garcia was \"[a]dvised of right to\n\ncounsel\" and \"[a]dvised of alien rights.\"   He never told the judge\n\nor anyone else his real name.    On March 28, still under the name\n\nDeLeon, Garcia entered a plea to the drug charge3 and was sentenced\n\nto time served, thirty days' incarceration.\n\n\n3\n  The district court found that Garcia pled nolo contendere, while\nthe government says he pled guilty. The difference is immaterial\nto his appeal.\n\n                                -5-\n\f          Garcia was then transferred to the custody of the INS.\n\nThere he again identified himself as DeLeon and consistently denied\n\nhaving legal status.    He denied having a visa or a Social Security\n\nnumber and claimed to be unemployed.\n\n          The INS Order to Show Cause issued to Garcia (under the\n\nname of DeLeon), which was written in both English and Spanish,\n\ninformed him, among other things, that he could \"seek an attorney\n\nor representative, if [he] desire[d] to be represented.\"           It also\n\ninformed him that if he was not satisfied with the eventual\n\ndecision of the Immigration Judge (IJ), he had the right to appeal.\n\nGarcia signed a form (using the name DeLeon) which stated that the\n\nOrder to Show Cause had been read to him in Spanish.            Garcia also\n\nsigned (as DeLeon) a form that stated, in Spanish, that he was \"not\n\na citizen of the United States,\" that he \"d[id] not wish to apply\n\nfor relief from deportation,\" and that he \"want[ed] to be deported\n\nas soon as possible.\"    The form further stated: \"This request is\n\ncompletely voluntary.        I have not been coerced, threatened, or\n\nenticed in any way . . . .\"\n\n          Prior   to   his    appearance   before   the   IJ,   Garcia   was\n\nprovided with a \"Notice of Rights\" in Spanish.        The notice had two\n\nrelevant sections. The first, entitled \"Right to be Represented by\n\nan Attorney or Representative,\" stated:\n\n          If you have any questions regarding any of\n          your rights you can speak with an attorney or\n          representative who can explain your rights,\n          including any relief that may be available to\n\n                                   -6-\n\f           you from deportation.    The officer who gave\n           you this notice will give you a list of\n           organizations    that   can    provide   legal\n           information.     Representatives from these\n           organizations will speak to you for free or\n           for a small fee, and some of them might speak\n           your language. . . . You may contact a lawyer\n           or other legal representative at this time or\n           at any other time prior to your departure from\n           the United States.\n\nThe   second   section,   entitled    \"Right   to   a   Hearing   Before   an\n\nImmigration Judge,\" stated in relevant part:\n\n           If you do not want to return to your country,\n           you have a right to a hearing before an\n           immigration judge, who will determine whether\n           you can remain in the United States. If you\n           request a hearing, you may be represented at\n           the hearing by a lawyer or other legal\n           representative at your own expense.     If you\n           cannot afford to pay a lawyer, you may contact\n           an organization on the list of free legal\n           services. For example, if you are married to\n           a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, or have\n           lived in the U.S. for seven years or longer,\n           and have not been convicted of a serious\n           crime, you may be eligible for relief from\n           deportation.\n\n(emphasis in the original).     Garcia signed the bottom of the form\n\n(as DeLeon), indicating he had read it.\n\n           Garcia also received, as part of the Order to Show Cause,\n\na page of written information entitled \"Notice of Rights and\n\nConsequences.\"    It stated, in both English and Spanish: \"You will\n\nbe given a list of organizations, attorneys and other persons who\n\nhave indicated their availability to represent aliens in these\n\nproceedings.     Some of these persons may represent you free of\n\ncharge or for a nominal fee.\"    It noted that hearings before the IJ\n\n                                     -7-\n\fwere typically scheduled no sooner than fourteen days after the\n\nissuance of the Order to Show Cause \"to allow you to seek an\n\nattorney or representative, if you desire to be represented.\"\n\n           On April 26, 1995, Garcia appeared before an IJ in\n\nOakdale,   Louisiana.     A   court   interpreter    was     present.   The\n\nfollowing colloquy ensued:\n\n           IJ: Mr. DeLeon, sir, this is your first\n           appearance in my court, Immigration Court. As\n           such, you're entitled to delaying your case,\n           if you wish, to better prepare your case or to\n           acquire an attorney or we may go forward\n           today, whichever you desire.\n\n           Garcia: I cannot afford an attorney. I would\n           like to -- I would like to ask for\n           deportation.\n\n           IJ:   Do  you   understand      the      nature     of\n           Immigration Court, sir?\n\n           Garcia: Yes.\n\nAt that point Garcia took an oath to testify truthfully.                The\n\ncolloquy then continued:\n\n           IJ: Sir, do you understand that you have the\n           right to have an attorney represent you at no\n           expense to the government?\n\n           Garcia: Yes.\n\n           . . . .\n\n           IJ: And you understand, sir, that you have the\n           right to appeal any decision of this court to\n           a higher court in Washington, DC, and you do\n           that through the Federal Court system of this\n           country?\n\n           Garcia: Yes.\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\f           IJ: Sir, do you acknowledge previous receipt\n           of the Form 6618, the legal aid sheet . . . as\n           well as your criminal conviction records?\n\n           Garcia: Yes.\n\n           Later, Garcia stated (still under oath) that he was not\n\na U.S. citizen or national and that he entered the United States in\n\n1990 without inspection.      The IJ found Garcia deportable.      The IJ\n\nasked the government attorney if he was \"aware of any relief\" from\n\ndeportation, to which the government replied: \"No, Your Honor.\"\n\nThe IJ ordered Garcia deported to the Dominican Republic. He asked\n\nGarcia: \"Do you wish to accept that decision or is there an\n\nappeal?\"   Garcia replied: \"I accept it.\"\n\nB.         Garcia's Re-entry and Second Conviction\n\n           Soon after Garcia's June 1995 deportation, his sister\n\nmailed his green card and passport from Massachusetts to him in the\n\nDominican Republic. Less than two months later, in late July 1995,\n\nGarcia used these documents to re-enter the United States via\n\nPuerto   Rico   under   his   real   name.4   He   did   not   inform   the\n\nimmigration officials that he had been deported as Dario DeLeon.\n\nAn immigration official checked Garcia's permanent resident card\n\nand then admitted him. Pursuant to standard practice at that time,\n\n\n\n\n4\n   Garcia states in his briefs that he re-entered the country in\nearly 1996, but immigration records show that the date was July 29,\n1995. The difference is immaterial to all questions on appeal,\nincluding the statute of limitations question. We refer to the re-\nentry date as 1995.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fhe did not take Garcia's fingerprints, nor did he check the prints\n\nalready on file for Garcia against any other database.\n\n            Garcia eventually moved back to Massachusetts, where he\n\nlived under his real name for several years.            In March 2003, Garcia\n\nargued with two people at a store in Massachusetts.             After he left\n\nthe store, he noticed that the two were following his car.                     He\n\ndecided to go to a police station.             The police asked him for\n\nidentification, which he provided (under his real name).                       The\n\npolice then arrested him on an outstanding warrant for operating an\n\nunregistered vehicle.        Garcia was fingerprinted, and the prints\n\nwere sent to the FBI for a check of the Bureau's database; at that\n\npoint, authorities realized that Garcia and \"DeLeon\" were one and\n\nthe same.\n\n            Garcia was charged with the federal crime of illegal re-\n\nentry in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1326.          Before trial, he moved to\n\ndismiss   the   indictment    under    the   theories    that   (1)    the   1995\n\ndeportation proceeding violated his right to due process and was\n\ninvalid under § 1326(d), and (2) the indictment was untimely.                  The\n\ndistrict court rejected these contentions in a detailed order,\n\ndiscussed below.\n\n            After a four-day jury trial, Garcia was convicted.                 On\n\nApril 29, 2004, the district court sentenced him to 33 months'\n\nimprisonment    (with   credit   for    time   served)    and   24    months   of\n\nsupervised release.     Garcia completed his term of imprisonment on\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fSeptember 2, 2005, during the pendency of this appeal, and was\n\ntransferred to INS custody to await deportation.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           Garcia's primary argument on appeal is that the district\n\ncourt erred when it found that he failed to meet the collateral\n\nattack   standard   under   §   1326(d)   and   refused   to   dismiss   the\n\nindictment.\n\n           Subsection 1326(d) bars any collateral challenge to the\n\nunderlying deportation order unless the alien demonstrates the\n\nfollowing:\n\n           (1) the alien exhausted any administrative\n           remedies that may have been available to seek\n           relief against the order;\n           (2) the deportation proceedings at which the\n           order was issued improperly deprived the alien\n           of the opportunity for judicial review; and\n           (3) the entry of the order was fundamentally\n           unfair.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1326(d).    Here, the district court found that Garcia had\n\nnot met the third ground, in part because he could not show\n\nfundamental unfairness, as required under § 1326(d)(3).          See Luna,\n\n436 F.3d at 316.      We review the subsidiary factual findings for\n\nclear error and the ultimate mixed conclusion that there was no\n\nfundamental unfairness de novo.      See id. at 316-17.\n\n           Garcia argued before the district court that he was\n\ndenied the right to counsel during the 1995 deportation proceeding,\n\nand therefore that he met prongs (2) and (3) and that he was\n\nexcused from meeting prong (1).      He argued that he was illiterate\n\n                                   -11-\n\fin both English and Spanish in 1995, and so the notices informing\n\nhim of his rights meant little.         He also contended that when the IJ\n\ntold him he could obtain counsel and he replied, \"I cannot afford\n\nan attorney,\" the IJ was obligated to pursue the matter.                He stated\n\nthat he never received the legal aid sheet listing pro bono service\n\nproviders, and that his affirmative answer when the IJ asked him if\n\nhe had received the sheet was simply a product of his confusion.\n\n              Garcia also argued that he met the requirements of\n\n§ 1326(d) because he did not know he was eligible for relief from\n\ndeportation.     He contended that as a lawful permanent resident, he\n\nwould have been eligible for discretionary relief under former\n\n§§ 212(c) and 212(h) of the Immigration and Nationality Act; he\n\nsaid the government led him to believe he was not eligible for\n\nrelief, and that the IJ deprived him of his right to be informed\n\nabout potential relief by failing to mention it.\n\n              The district court rejected Garcia's collateral attack,\n\nfirst in a pretrial opinion and order and again after the verdict.\n\nThe   court    skipped   over    the    exhaustion         and   judicial   review\n\nrequirements of § 1326(d)(1) and (d)(2) and instead held that\n\nGarcia could not show, pursuant to § 1326(d)(3), that entry of the\n\n1995 deportation order was fundamentally unfair.                 This was so for\n\nseveral   reasons.       As     to   the      right   to    be   informed    about\n\ndiscretionary relief, the district court found that the IJ's\n\nfailure to mention it was entirely Garcia's fault: Garcia had lied\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fto the IJ and INS officials from the beginning, giving them a false\n\nname   and    telling   them    he     had    no   legal   status.    Under   the\n\ncircumstances, the court found, the IJ had no duty to tell Garcia\n\nabout discretionary relief, because the IJ had no way to know\n\nGarcia was eligible.5\n\n              As to the right to counsel, the court found that Garcia\n\nhad    been     \"notified      twice     in    writing     of   his   right   to\n\nrepresentation,\" that the IJ had informed him of his right to\n\nobtain counsel yet he had declined, and that he had told the IJ he\n\nreceived the legal aid sheet. In the post-verdict order, the court\n\nexplicitly found not credible Garcia's testimony during a pretrial\n\nmotion hearing that he had never received the legal aid sheet, and\n\nadded that even if he had not received it, that would not render\n\nthe proceedings unfair, because he told the IJ he had.                    As to\n\nGarcia's purported illiteracy, the district court wrote that it was\n\n\"certainly relevant to a due process inquiry\" but that \"it does not\n\nexcuse [Garcia's] failure to notify the immigration judge . . .\n\nthat he wanted help in finding an attorney or that he needed help\n\nin reading a list of lawyers.\"\n\n              Finally, and importantly, the district court concluded\n\nthat Garcia could not in any event demonstrate prejudice, as\n\n\n5\n   The court rejected Garcia's argument that the IJ and other INS\nofficials should have known, or did know, that Garcia was lying\nabout his identity and status.

This was because Garcia did not\n\nintend to avail himself of counsel, but rather intended all along\n\nto lie about his identity and be deported as quickly as possible so\n\nthat he could re-enter using his green card and real name.                The\n\ncourt found: \"The totality of Defendant's actions and statements\n\nindicates   that   he   wanted   his   true   identity   and    legal   status\n\nconcealed, rather than trumpeted.\"\n\n            On appeal, Garcia presents the broad argument that at his\n\ndeportation   hearing,    \"the   government    merely    went   through    the\n\nmotions and failed to give meaning to [his] rights.\"            He says this\n\nis because the IJ \"failed to determine whether Mr. Garcia wished to\n\nbe represented by counsel\" and \"failed to advise Mr. Garcia of his\n\nright to pro bono self-obtained counsel.\"          The brief also argues\n\nthat Garcia's rights were impinged because \"the INS failed to\n\nprovide Mr. Garcia with a list of legal aid counsel, as it was\n\nrequired to do, thus preventing Mr. Garcia from retaining counsel\n\nwho would have obtained § 212(c) relief from deportation.\"\n\n            These arguments are an attempt to ignore the district\n\ncourt's findings of fact.6        The district court explicitly found\n\n\n6\n   The brief, for example, entirely fails to inform us that the\ndistrict court found Garcia's use of the name DeLeon during the\noriginal deportation to be a deliberate scheme by Garcia to enhance\nhis prospects for later entry. The brief also asserts, based on\nGarcia's testimony, that he never received the legal aid sheet, and\nfails to inform us of the district court's finding that that\ntestimony was not credible. Counsel are not free, on appeal, to\n\n                                   -14-\n\fthat Garcia had been advised multiple times of his right to obtain\n\ncounsel during the immigration proceedings, that his testimony that\n\nhe never received the legal aid list was not credible, that he\n\nnever said he wanted a lawyer, and that he never requested time to\n\nfind a lawyer.      The court also found that it was quite unlikely\n\nGarcia wanted a lawyer; to further his scheme of fraudulent re-\n\nentry, he wanted to be quickly deported under the false name.\n\nThose    factual   findings    required      a   finding   that     Garcia   could\n\ndemonstrate neither prejudice nor fundamental unfairness.                       No\n\neffort is made to show that the findings are clearly erroneous.\n\n            Nonetheless,      we    have   given    Garcia    the    benefit    of\n\nreviewing the district court's findings against the evidence, and\n\nthere was no error at all.          The district court's ruling that the\n\nthird    precondition    for       collateral     attack     was    not   met   is\n\nunassailable.\n\n            We add that ordinarily, the § 1326(d) analysis should\n\nstart with the first ground, which the district court skipped\n\nover.7   Congress has mandated that \"an alien may not challenge the\n\n\n\nignore the district court's findings and argue the facts de novo,\neven if the ultimate conclusion of law drawn by the district court\nfrom the facts is subject to de novo review.\n7\n  While courts have some leeway in the structuring of opinions, it\nis quite clear that Congress has, particularly in the immigration\nlaws, placed a premium on exhaustion of agency remedies. In many\ncases, if there has been no such exhaustion by taking an appeal to\nthe Board of Immigration Appeals, a court would not consider the\npetitioner's claims.\n\n                                      -15-\n\fvalidity of the deportation order\" unless that alien \"exhausted any\n\nadministrative remedies that may have been available to seek relief\n\nagainst the order.\"     8 U.S.C. § 1326(d)(1) (emphasis added).           It is\n\nclear that appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) is such\n\nan administrative remedy, and that failure to take such an appeal\n\nconstitutes a failure of exhaustion.

Garcia was told at least\n\ntwice -- once when the Order to Show Cause was read to him, and\n\nagain by the IJ -- that he had the right to appeal.             He was asked\n\nagain by the IJ later in the proceeding whether he desired to\n\nappeal.   He   stated   that   he   did    not;   he   also   signed   a   form\n\nindicating that he did not wish to contest deportation.

Further, the\n\ndistrict court found on ample evidence that Garcia never had any\n\nintention of appealing, because he wanted to be deported as quickly\n\nas possible so that he could re-enter under his real name.                 See\n\nMartinez-Rocha, 337 F.3d at 569 (finding of knowing waiver was\n\nsupported by an INS agent's testimony that the alien \"had expressed\n\na desire to return to Mexico as soon as possible\").\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\f           Garcia   argues   that   his    waiver   was   not   knowing   and\n\nintelligent because the IJ did not tell him he was eligible for\n\ndiscretionary relief and the government attorney \"affirmatively\n\ninformed [him] that he was not entitled to any discretionary\n\nrelief.\"   Again, the argument depends on ignoring the district\n\ncourt's factual findings.     It was Garcia's lies about his identity\n\nand his failure to disclose his green card status that hid his\n\npotential eligibility from the government and the IJ.8           He gets no\n\nreward for that.    Cf. 8 C.F.R. § 1240.49(a) (stating in the context\n\nof other forms of relief that the IJ \"shall inform the respondent\n\nof his or her apparent eligibility\") (emphasis added).\n\n           In sum, Garcia knew precisely what he was doing when he\n\ndecided to forgo an appeal of his 1995 deportation order; if there\n\nis an exception to the § 1326(d)(1) exhaustion requirement, he does\n\nnot fall within it.     His challenge to the 1995 deportation order\n\nfails.\n\n                                    III.\n\nA.         The Statute of Limitations\n\n           The crime of illegal re-entry is subject to a five-year\n\nstatute of limitations, 18 U.S.C. § 3282.             The district court\n\ndenied Garcia's pretrial motion to dismiss the indictment on\n\n\n8\n   In all events, as a factual matter, Garcia received and signed\nat least one form telling him that aliens with various types of\nstatus in the United States, such as those married to permanent\nresidents and those who had spent many years in the country, could\nbe eligible for relief.\n\n                                    -18-\n\flimitations grounds.         The issue also was submitted to the jury,\n\nwhich made a specific finding that the government had proved the\n\nindictment was timely.

The argument is based on\n\nlanguage from other courts in factually distinct cases to the\n\neffect   that   an   alien    is   \"found\"   for    §   1326   purposes   \"when\n\nimmigration     authorities     could   have,   through    the   exercise   of\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fdiligence typical of law enforcement authorities, discovered the\n\nviolation\" -- in other words, when they had constructive knowledge\n\nthat the alien was in the country illegally.

Garcia\n\nargues that the jury was compelled to find that the government had\n\nthe requisite constructive knowledge as soon as he re-entered the\n\ncountry, and so the limitations period ran several years before his\n\n2003 indictment.   This, he says, is because diligent immigration\n\nauthorities would have realized at the time of his 1995 re-entry\n\nthat he and \"DeLeon\" were the same person.\n\n          The district court, in considering Garcia's motion to\n\ndismiss, accepted the existence of this constructive knowledge\n\ntheory for purposes of analysis.   It examined pre-trial affidavits\n\nand other evidence submitted by the government which stated that\n\nimmigration procedures in place in 1995 did not involve checking\n\nthe fingerprints of arriving green card holders like Garcia against\n\nany database of criminals or of past deportees. The district court\n\nfound that based on this evidence, and on the fact that Garcia lied\n\nabout his identity during the deportation process, it could not say\n\nas a matter of law that immigration officials exercising ordinary\n\ndiligence should have known at the time of Garcia's re-entry that\n\nhe previously had been deported.\n\n\n\n\n                               -20-\n\f            We approach the question differently.         This court has\n\nnever adopted the theory that the government may be charged with\n\nconstructive knowledge of an alien's illegal re-entry for purposes\n\nof § 1326, and there are certainly good arguments against the\n\ntheory in this context.        We do not, however, resolve the broad\n\nquestion of whether constructive knowledge can be attributed to the\n\ngovernment.    We hold more narrowly that for statute of limitations\n\npurposes in § 1326 prosecutions, there can be no finding of lack of\n\ndiligence where it is deception by the alien as to his identity\n\nthat has caused the government not to have knowledge of his\n\npresence.    To hold otherwise would be to reward deceit by the alien\n\nand   to   encourage   the   withholding   of   information,   and   so   the\n\ncorruption of the deportation process.9            Cf.

In any event, the facts before the\n\ndistrict court prior to trial showed that the government could not,\n\nin the ordinary course, have discovered the deception, and so there\n\nwould be no basis for a constructive knowledge claim even if one\n\nwere cognizable.\n\n\n9\n   Garcia relies on Gomez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681058\"><a href=\"/opinion/681058/united-states-v-javier-dario-gomez/\"><span class=\"volume\">38</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1031</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, for the conclusion that\nthe constructive knowledge rule should apply even where an alien's\ndeception prevented immigration officials from learning his true\nidentity.

The government\n\nintroduced evidence at trial to the effect that it did not know\n\nGarcia had illegally re-entered the country until he was arrested\n\nin 2003; this evidence was uncontradicted.       The jury had ample\n\nbasis to find that it was not a lack of diligence by the government\n\nthat resulted in the timing of the indictment in this case.\n\nB.          Consent to Re-enter\n\n            Garcia next argues the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport the jury's conclusion that he lacked the Attorney General's\n\nconsent to re-enter the country.     \"In reviewing such a challenge,\n\nwe consider the record evidence (and any reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom) as a whole and in the light most favorable to the\n\nprosecution, asking whether the evidence would have permitted a\n\nrational jury to find the defendants guilty of the crime charged\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.\" United States v.

(citing Scantleberry-Frank,\n\n158 F.3d at 616); see 8 U.S.C. § 1326(a).           At trial, the government\n\npresented    evidence     as     to    the    \"express    consent\"     prong   --\n\nspecifically, a Certificate of Nonexistence of Record stating that\n\nno such consent appeared in the INS A-File10 on \"Dario DeLeon.\"\n\nGarcia argues that since the INS kept a separate A-File on \"Rafael\n\nGarcia,\"    the   jury   could   not    convict   absent    evidence    that   no\n\nindication of consent appeared in the Rafael Garcia file either.\n\nSince the government produced no such evidence, he says, it failed\n\nto carry its burden.\n\n            This argument is without merit. Garcia's own lies led to\n\nhis deportation under the name DeLeon.                   If he had requested\n\npermission to re-enter after deportation, he would have had to do\n\nso as DeLeon (otherwise the request would have made no sense to the\n\nimmigration authorities) and any such permission logically would be\n\nin the \"DeLeon\" file.       Further, as the district court found, the\n\nevidence supports the conclusion that Garcia schemed to be deported\n\nunder a false name so he could immediately re-enter using his real\n\nidentity.    A jury could reasonably infer that Garcia never would\n\nhave requested permission (under any name) to re-enter, since such\n\n\n\n10\n    An INS A-File \"records every contact an alien has with the\nimmigration service.\" Meléndez-Torres, 420 F.3d at 47.\n\n                                       -23-\n\fa request would have alerted the INS to his deception.   In short,\n\nthe evidence is more than sufficient to sustain the jury verdict.\n\n          Garcia falls back to an argument that he in fact had\n\nexpress permission to re-enter the country because he did so using\n\nhis green card, which was issued by the Attorney General and which\n\nhe says constitutes the requisite permission.     As the district\n\ncourt said: \"Under defendant's interpretation of the statute, he\n\ncan lie about his identity . . . and then re-enter with impunity\n\nusing a green card under his real name.      This would obviously\n\nfrustrate the statutory purpose of keeping previously-deported\n\naliens from reentering the country without the Attorney General's\n\n'express' prior permission.\"     Garcia had just been deported,\n\nregardless of what name he was using at the time, and he therefore\n\nneeded the Attorney General's contemporaneous permission before he\n\ncould legally re-enter.   8 U.S.C. § 1326(a).   If Garcia had been\n\ndeported under his real name, his green card likely would have been\n\nrevoked, and in any event obviously would not constitute such\n\npermission.11 He can gain no advantage from having deceived the INS\n\nabout his identity.\n\n\n\n11\n   Garcia cites a case, United States v.

The Idowu court\nheld no such thing. It said only that the defendant alien might\nnot have needed consent at all because more than five years had\npassed since his deportation; because the crucial question involved\npassage of time, the court noted that the validity or invalidity of\nhis arrival documents was irrelevant to its analysis.

The Almendarez-Torres Issue\n\n           Garcia argues that his conviction must be vacated because\n\nthe district court did not submit to the jury the question of his\n\nunderlying 1995 drug conviction.

Nonetheless, in a\n\nlong footnote in his brief on appeal, Garcia says he is entitled to\n\nbe resentenced, presumably to alter the sentence of supervised\n\nrelease.\n\n            Garcia     was      sentenced       under       the   mandatory     Guidelines\n\nscheme in place prior to United States v.

The argument is that\n\nGarcia,    who     is    in   immigration        custody       and    facing    imminent\n\ndeportation from the United States, will never be subject to the\n\nsupervised release portion of his sentence.                    The government argues\n\nthat the possibility that Garcia could one day return to the United\n\nStates does not change the analysis.                    This is because Garcia is\n\ninadmissible as a result of his 1995 cocaine conviction, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§    1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(II),          and      ineligible         for    a     waiver     of\n\ninadmissibility, id. § 1182(h)(2). Therefore, Garcia could only be\n\nin   the   United       States,   and   potentially        subject      to     supervised\n\nrelease, if he broke the law to get here; this will not suffice,\n\nthe government argues, because a stake in the outcome of a case\n\nwill   not    create       standing     if   it    is     \"contingent        upon     [the\n\ndefendant's] violating the law\" in the future.

The court reporter was granted several extensions, without\n\nobjection, which pushed the deadline back to November 1.              When the\n\ntranscript was not prepared by that date, this court issued an\n\nOrder to Show Cause directing production of the transcripts by\n\nNovember 22.    Several more rounds of orders and extension requests\n\nfollowed.\n\n             On August 11, 2005, some fourteen months after the Notice\n\nof Appeal, Garcia first moved to compel production.

Garcia says this delay violated his due process\n\nright to a timely appeal, and that the remedy must be reversal of\n\nhis conviction.

Evitts v.

Those courts that have\n\naccepted the analogy between pretrial delay and appellate delay\n\nhave adopted this inquiry almost whole cloth and looked for three\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\fkinds of potential prejudice from appellate delay: \"(1) oppressive\n\nincarceration pending appeal, (2) anxiety and concern of the\n\nconvicted   party   awaiting     the    outcome   of   the   appeal,   and    (3)\n\nimpairment of the convicted person's grounds for appeal or of the\n\nviability of his defense in case of retrial.\"            Hawkins, 78 F.3d at\n\n351 (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Tucker, 8 F.3d at\n\n646); see also Rheuark, 628 F.2d at 303 n.8.\n\n            In our view, the due process issues caused by delay on\n\nappeal are more limited than those resulting from delay in the\n\ntrial court.      Cf. Ross v. Moffitt, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109070\"><a href=\"/opinion/109070/ross-v-moffitt/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 610 (1974)\n\n(noting, in the context of due process requirements, that \"there\n\nare significant differences between the trial and appellate stages\n\nof a criminal proceeding\").       And so we reject, at least in cases of\n\ndelayed transcripts on appeal, the direct analogy made to tests\n\ninvolving the Sixth Amendment speedy trial right, which underlies\n\nthe so-often articulated three-factor prejudice test quoted above.\n\nOther   courts   have   shared   this    concern.      See,   e.g.,    Cody    v.\n\nHenderson, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563667\"><a href=\"/opinion/563667/william-cody-v-robert-j-henderson-warden-auburn-correctional-facility/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">715</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 719 (2d Cir. 1991) (\"Certainly, the\n\ndifferences in a defendant's situation before trial and after\n\nconviction suggest that at the very least the Barker factors should\n\nnot be applied uncritically.\"); see also Arkin, Speedy Criminal\n\nAppeal: A Right Without A Remedy, 74 Minn. L. Rev. 437, 473-81\n\n(1990) (concluding that the concerns of Barker, and the Barker\n\ntest, do not translate to the appellate delay setting).\n\n\n                                       -35-\n\f           The first two of the adopted Barker prejudice factors\n\nhave little rationale in the appellate context.                  A defendant who\n\nhas been convicted of a crime no longer enjoys a presumption of\n\ninnocence, Herrera v. Collins, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112808\"><a href=\"/opinion/112808/herrera-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">390</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 399 (1993), and so his\n\nincarceration      pending     appeal    cannot     itself      be    said   to   be\n\n\"oppressive.\"       Further,     there    are     other   remedies       concerning\n\nconditions of confinement.           The appellant may or may not meet the\n\nrequirements      for   bail    on    appeal.13      If    the       conditions   of\n\nincarceration raise Eighth Amendment concerns, habeas corpus is\n\navailable.      Similarly, while any defendant who has been convicted\n\nof a crime may experience anxiety during the pendency of the\n\nappeal, this consideration is not useful to evaluating prejudice\n\nfor due process purposes.\n\n           Because Garcia has not shown prejudice, we do not reach\n\nthe   reasons    for    the    delay.     Sometimes       the    reasons     involve\n\ninadequate resources in the reporting services available to the\n\ndistrict court, or overly busy court reporters; sometimes there are\n\n\n\n13\n   Indeed, delay in the appeals process may itself strengthen an\nappellant's case for having met those requirements, so long as that\ndelay is not attributable to the appellant. See, e.g., Leigh v.\nUnited States, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">994</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 997 (1962) (Warren, Circuit Justice)\n(granting bail where \"th[e] appeal is not frivolous, . . . such\ndelays as have occurred can hardly be attributed to applicant . . .\n[and] [t]he Government does not contend that there is a likelihood\nthat applicant will flee the jurisdiction.\"); United States v.\nBentvena, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"258244\"><a href=\"/opinion/258244/united-states-v-william-bentvena-carmine-panico-and-william-struzzieri/\"><span class=\"volume\">308</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 48 (2d Cir. 1962) (rejecting bail but noting\nthat \"[i]f for any reason there are delays in the hearing of these\nappeals for which the appellants are not responsible these motions\nmay be renewed.\").\n\n                                        -36-\n\fother reasons.
