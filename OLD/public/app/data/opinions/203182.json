The appellants, who are poultry\n\nfarmers, sued the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and two Commonwealth\n\nofficials under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.         The farmers' suit claimed that\n\nthe defendants denied them certain benefits, in violation of their\n\ndue process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United\n\nStates Constitution.       The plaintiffs also presented claims under\n\nPuerto Rico law, which were joined under supplemental jurisdiction.\n\nThe magistrate judge dismissed the claims.          We affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            Plaintiffs Félix Pérez-Acevedo and Iris Yolanda-Quiñones\n\noperate Don Manuel Poultry Farm, a farm dedicated to the production\n\nand sale of fresh eggs.          In 2003, Puerto Rico's Secretary of\n\nAgriculture promulgated a regulation that reorganized production in\n\nthe poultry industry.      Administrative Order No. 2003-058-Amended.1\n\nAs   part   of   the   reorganizational   scheme,   farmers   could,   on   a\n\nvoluntary basis, join a production \"nucleus\" that would allow them\n\nto market products under the label \"Del País\".2           The order also\n\nprovided that nucleus members would receive specific benefits from\n\nPuerto Rico's Department of Agriculture, including loan-guarantee\n\nprograms, infrastructure programs, and tax credits.\n\n\n\n\n1\n The enabling authority for this regulation was adopted in 1996.\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 5, §§ 3051-59.\n2\n \"Del País\" is a mark of geographic origin that means \"From the\nCountry\".\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            The plaintiffs did not join a nucleus, as the Don Manuel\n\nPoultry Farm promotes and distributes its own products and they saw\n\nno business reason to join.           As a result, they experienced three\n\ndisadvantages:      1) they were denied financial assistance for\n\nexpansion of their farm from the Department of Agriculture; 2) they\n\nwere charged special fees for inspections conducted by regulatory\n\nagencies;    and   3)   they   were    rendered   newly   ineligible    for   an\n\nexisting supermarket credit program, whereby grocers received tax\n\ncredits to buy products from designated local producers.\n\n            The plaintiffs filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against\n\nthe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and two Commonwealth officials,\n\nformer Secretary of the Department of Agriculture Luis Rivero-\n\nCubano and Deputy Controller of the Fresh Eggs Industry of the\n\nDepartment    of   Agriculture        Yasenia   Figueroa-Guzmán,   in    their\n\npersonal and official capacities.3 The plaintiffs alleged that the\n\n\"Del País\" program had violated their rights under the First and\n\nFourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.4                 They\n\n\n\n\n3\n The official capacity claims and those against the Commonwealth\nwere dismissed early on in the litigation and are not part of this\nappeal.\n4\n On appeal, the plaintiffs assert that the actions of the\ndefendants deprived them of a property interest in violation of the\n\"Fifth and/or Fourteenth Amendment.\" As the Fifth Amendment was\nnot mentioned in their complaint, we do not consider it now. See\nGeneral Motors Corp. v. Darling's, 444 F.3d 98, 113 (1st Cir. 2006)\n(court of appeals will not entertain legal theories not raised\nbelow).\n\n                                        -4-\n\falso asserted claims under Puerto Rico's Constitution and P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. tit. 31, §§ 5141-42.        See 28 U.S.C. § 1367.5\n\n             The defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings,\n\nunder Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c), was granted, and this appeal followed.\n\n                                       II.\n\n             We review the grant of judgment on the pleadings de novo.\n\n    Mongeau v. City of Marlborough, 492 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n             A motion for judgment on the pleadings is treated much\n\nlike a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.              Curran v. Cousins, 509\n\nF.3d 36, 43-44 (1st Cir. 2007).              \"Because [a Rule 12(c)] motion\n\ncalls for an assessment of the merits of the case at an embryonic\n\nstage, the court must view the facts contained in the pleadings in\n\nthe light most favorable to the nonmovant and draw all reasonable\n\ninferences therefrom . . . .\"          R.G. Fin. Corp. v. Vergara-Nunez,\n\n446 F.3d 178, 182 (1st Cir. 2006).           Under Bell Atlantic v. Twombly,\n\n127 S. Ct. 1955, 1965 (2007), to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion\n\n(and, by extension, a Rule 12(c) motion) a complaint must contain\n\nfactual    allegations    that   \"raise      a   right   to   relief   above   the\n\nspeculative level, on the assumption that all the allegations in\n\nthe complaint are true . . . .\"              Id. at 1965 (internal citation\n\nomitted).\n\n\n\n\n5\n The supplemental        state   law    claims      were      dismissed   without\nprejudice.\n\n                                       -5-\n\f             From this posture, we consider the plaintiffs' claims.\n\nA section 1983 violation occurs when an official acting under color\n\nof state law acts to deprive an individual of a federally protected\n\nright.6    Maymi v. Puerto Rico Ports Authority, ___ F.3d ___, 2008\n\nWL 240376 at *3 (1st Cir. Jan. 30, 2008).             Here, we assume that all\n\nfacts in the complaint are true.              We must determine whether, on\n\nthose     facts,   the   plaintiffs     would    be   able   show   \"above    the\n\nspeculative    level\"     that   such    a    deprivation    occurred.       Bell\n\nAtlantic, 127 S. Ct. at 1965.\n\n             This appeal centers on the plaintiffs' procedural due\n\nprocess claims.7     The plaintiffs make an initial argument that the\n\ncourt failed to consider their procedural due process claim in its\n\norder granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings.8             Although\n\nthe dismissal order mentions the due process argument several\n\ntimes, the order does not analyze the claim. Nevertheless, we have\n\nconsidered the plaintiffs' procedural due process claim and find\n\nthat it fails on the merits.       See Torromeo v. Town of Fremont, 438\n\n\n6\n For the purposes of a section 1983 analysis, Puerto Rico is\nconsidered a state.    Redondo-Borges v. United States Dep't of\nHousing and Urban Dev., 421 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2005).\n7\n The plaintiffs have waived the First Amendment and equal\nprotection claims asserted below by not raising those claims before\nus. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n8\n The defendants argue that the due process claim was asserted for\nthe first time on appeal.    But the plaintiffs did assert a due\nprocess violation in their complaint, albeit without great detail,\nand also argued the due process issue in their opposition to the\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fF.3d 113, 118 (1st Cir. 2006) (under de novo review we may affirm\n\nthe court below on any basis made apparent from the record).\n\n             The test for a procedural due process violation requires\n\nthe plaintiffs to show first, a deprivation of a protected property\n\ninterest, and second, a denial of due process.           To meet the first\n\nprong and show that a \"statutorily created benefit\" is a property\n\ninterest, \"a person 'must have more than a unilateral expectation\n\nof it.     He must, instead, have a legitimate claim of entitlement to\n\nit.'\"      Coyne v. City of Somerville, 972 F.2d 440, 443 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (quoting Board of Regents v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)).\n\nIn order to be \"legitimate,\" the entitlement must be grounded in\n\nsome statute, rule, or policy.        Roth, 408 U.S. at 576.\n\n             The complaint did assert an entitlement to the \"benefits,\n\ncredits and incentives\" the Don Manuel Poultry Farm received prior\n\nto   the    enactment   of   the   nucleus   program,   but   whether   that\n\nentitlement is grounded in state law is less clear.           The complaint\n\nreferenced two different sources of state law:            1) a tax credit\n\nprogram; and 2) a 2001 statute regarding financial assistance for\n\nfarmers.\n\n             The tax credit program, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 13, § 8440f,\n\ndoes not confer a property interest upon the plaintiffs:           the tax\n\ncredits belong to supermarkets, not farmers.            See Town of Castle\n\nRock v. Gonzales, 545 U.S. 748, 767 (2005) (indirect benefits are\n\nnot protected property interests.)\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f          The plaintiffs' other claim, grounded on an asserted\n\nentitlement to financial assistance based on the 2001 statute,\n\nfares no better.      First of all, the claim is not argued on appeal,\n\nand is thus waived.           Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17.            Second, the\n\ncomplaint's reference to the statute lacks identifying information\n\nsuch as a citation or an English language title.9            Conceivably, the\n\nstatute grants the plaintiffs a property interest in the financial\n\nassistance.    See, e.g., Mard v. Town of Amherst, 350 F.3d 184, 189\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (finding property interest in firefighter's injury\n\nleave benefits based on Massachusetts law); PFZ Props., Inc. v.\n\nRodriguez, 928 F.2d 28, 30-31 (1st Cir. 1991) (assuming property\n\ninterest in building permit based on Puerto Rico law).                  But to\n\nassume an entitlement grounded in state law from a complaint that\n\nmakes scant reference to an insufficiently identified statute would\n\ngo   against   Bell     Atlantic's     admonition    that     a   complaint's\n\nallegations must be more than \"speculative.\"              127 S. Ct. at 1965.\n\nWe decline to make that assumption here.\n\n          Even   were    we    to   assume   that   the    plaintiffs   had   a\n\nprotected property interest in financial assistance, to prevail in\n\ntheir claim they would need to demonstrate a denial of due process.\n\nIn this regard, the complaint does not assert that Puerto Rico's\n\n\n\n9\n \"It is well settled that federal litigation in Puerto Rico [must]\nbe conducted in English.\" González-De-Blasini v. Family Dep't, 377\nF.3d 81, 88 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation and internal quotation marks\nomitted).\n\n                                     -8-\n\fprocedures in the administration of financial assistance, or in any\n\nother area, violated due process.       In their opposition below and in\n\ntheir appellate brief, however, the plaintiffs reference Puerto\n\nRico's Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (\"UAPA\"), P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 3, §§ 2101-2201, to suggest that they were entitled to a\n\nhearing upon denial of their request for financial assistance. They\n\ndo not, however, provide any analysis of the statute to support the\n\ncontention that a hearing was required.10\n\n             The   UAPA   provides   procedural     safeguards    for   actions\n\nundertaken by Puerto Rico's administrative agencies, but carves out\n\nan exception for certain types of actions, including administration\n\nof loans and subsidies.        P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 2151.             Those\n\nactions are considered \"informal non-quasi judicial procedures\" and\n\nthere is no entitlement to formal procedures such as hearings.              Id.\n\nThe   only   procedural    right   available   in    the   case   of    informal\n\n\n\n10\n Consideration of another provision mentioned in the plaintiffs'\nopposition, 2002 regulation No. 6398, is waived. The plaintiffs\nclaim that this regulation establishes a framework for providing\nfinancial assistance to farmers. But the regulation is not in the\nrecord, and no English translation is readily available.        See\nGonzález-De-Blasini, 377 F.3d at 88. The plaintiffs did not file\na motion to supplement the record with this regulation at any\npoint, nor did they request that this court take judicial notice of\nthe regulation. Although the plaintiffs discussed the regulation\nat oral argument, they neither identified it nor discussed it in\ntheir appellate brief.       While a 2001 financial assistance\nregulation is mentioned in the plaintiffs' complaint, they have\nprovided this court with little or no basis to conclude that the\ntwo regulations are one and the same, and no developed\nargumentation as to either regulation on appeal. Reliance on 2002\nregulation No. 6398 is therefore waived. Zannino, 895 F.2d at 17.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fprocedures is the right to petition for reconsideration by filing\n\na motion within 20 days of an adverse decision.   Id. § 2165.   Here,\n\nthe Department of Agriculture's denial of benefits to the plaintiffs\n\nwas an informal procedure.   The plaintiffs do not allege that they\n\nrequested and were denied reconsideration.    In the absence of any\n\ndeveloped argument that the UAPA entitled them to a hearing despite\n\nits express language to the contrary, the plaintiffs' claim that\n\nthey were entitled to a hearing fails, as well.\n\n           For the above reasons, the plaintiffs have not shown a\n\ndenial of rights secured by the Constitution, and as such the motion\n\nfor judgment on the pleadings was properly granted.11\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n11\n The plaintiffs also argued that the court erred in allowing the\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings to be filed after a pre-\nexisting deadline.    The original deadline to file dispositive\nmotions was October 15, 2005, and the defendants did not file their\nmotion until June 27, 2006. In late 2005, both parties consented\nto have the case tried by a magistrate judge, who, in response to\ndelays and rescheduling requests, issued a new scheduling order and\nset a new date for trial of August, 2006. The magistrate judge did\nnot specifically set a new deadline for dispositive motions. There\nwas no abuse of discretion in the decision to allow the motion.\nJudges have \"great latitude\" to exercise authority in matters of\ncase management. Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st\nCir. 1998) (quoting Jones v. Winnepesaukee Realty, 990 F.2d 1, 5\n(1st Cir. 1993)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                               -10-\n\f",

In order to be \"legitimate,\" the entitlement must be grounded in some statute, rule, or policy. <i>Roth,</i> 408 U.S. at 576, 92 S.Ct. 2701.</p>\n<p>The complaint did assert an entitlement to the \"benefits, credits and incentives\" the Don Manuel Poultry Farm received prior to the enactment of the nucleus program, but whether that entitlement is grounded in state law is less clear. The complaint referenced two different sources of state law: 1) a tax credit program; and 2) a 2001 statute regarding financial assistance for farmers.</p>\n<p>The tax credit program, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 13, § 8440f, does not confer a property interest upon the plaintiffs: the tax credits belong to supermarkets, not farmers. <i>See </i><i>Town of Castle Rock v. Gonzales,</i> 545 U.S. 748, 767, 125 S.Ct. 2796, 162 L.Ed.2d 658 (2005) (indirect benefits are not protected property interests.)</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' other claim, grounded on an asserted entitlement to financial assistance based on the 2001 statute, fares no better. First of all, the claim is not argued on appeal, and is thus waived. <i>Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17. Second, the complaint's reference to the statute lacks identifying information such as a citation or an English language title.<sup>[9]</sup> Conceivably, the statute grants the plaintiffs a property interest in the financial assistance. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Mard v. Town of Amherst,</i> 350 F.3d 184, 189 (1st Cir.2003) (finding property interest in firefighter's injury leave benefits based on Massachusetts law); <i>PFZ Props., Inc. v. Rodriguez,</i> 928 F.2d 28, 30-31 (1st Cir.1991) (assuming property interest in building permit based on Puerto Rico law). But to assume an entitlement grounded in state law from a complaint that makes scant reference to an insufficiently identified statute would go against <i>Bell Atlantic</i>'s admonition that a complaint's allegations must be more than \"speculative.\" 127 S.Ct. at 1965. We decline to make that assumption here.</p>\n<p>Even were we to assume that the plaintiffs had a protected property interest in financial assistance, to prevail in their claim they would need to demonstrate a denial of due process. In this regard, the complaint does not assert that Puerto Rico's procedures in the administration of financial assistance, or in any other area, violated due process. In their opposition below and in their appellate brief, however, the plaintiffs reference Puerto Rico's Uniform Administrative Procedure Act (\"UAPA\"), P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, §§ 2101-2201, to suggest that they were entitled to a hearing upon denial of their request for financial assistance. They do not, however, provide any analysis of the statute to support the contention that a hearing was required.<sup>[10]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*31</span> The UAPA provides procedural safeguards for actions undertaken by Puerto Rico's administrative agencies, but carves out an exception for certain types of actions, including administration of loans and subsidies. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 2151. Those actions are considered \"informal non-quasi judicial procedures\" and there is no entitlement to formal procedures such as hearings. <i>Id.</i> The only procedural right available in the case of informal procedures is the right to petition for reconsideration by filing a motion within 20 days of an adverse decision. <i>Id.</i> § 2165. Here, the Department of Agriculture's denial of benefits to the plaintiffs was an informal procedure. The plaintiffs do not allege that they requested and were denied reconsideration. In the absence of any developed argument that the UAPA entitled them to a hearing despite its express language to the contrary, the plaintiffs' claim that they were entitled to a hearing fails, as well.</p>\n<p>For the above reasons, the plaintiffs have not shown a denial of rights secured by the Constitution, and as such the motion for judgment on the pleadings was properly granted.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The enabling authority for this regulation was adopted in 1996.

The farmers' suit claimed that the defendants denied them certain benefits, in violation of their due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. The plaintiffs also presented claims under Puerto Rico law, which were joined under supplemental jurisdiction. The magistrate judge dismissed the claims. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs Félix Pérez-Acevedo and Iris Yolanda-Quiñones operate Don Manuel Poultry Farm, a farm dedicated to the production and sale of fresh eggs. In 2003, Puerto Rico's Secretary of Agriculture promulgated a regulation that reorganized production in the poultry industry. Administrative Order No.2003-058-Amended.<sup>[1]</sup> As part of the reorganizational scheme, farmers could, on a voluntary basis, join a production \"nucleus\" that would allow them to market products under the label \"Del País\".<sup>[2]</sup> The order also provided that nucleus members would receive specific benefits from Puerto Rico's Department of Agriculture, including loan-guarantee programs, infrastructure programs, and tax credits.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs did not join a nucleus, as the Don Manuel Poultry Farm promotes and distributes its own products and they saw no business reason to join. As a result, they experienced three disadvantages: 1) they were denied financial assistance for expansion of their farm from the Department of Agriculture; 2) they were charged special fees for inspections conducted by regulatory agencies; and 3) they were rendered newly ineligible for an existing supermarket credit program, whereby grocers received tax credits to buy products from designated local producers.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and two Commonwealth officials, former Secretary of the Department of Agriculture Luis Rivero-Cubano and Deputy Controller of the Fresh Eggs Industry of the Department of Agriculture Yasenia Figueroa-Guzmán, in their personal and official capacities.<sup>[3]</sup> The plaintiffs alleged that the \"Del País\" program had violated their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> States Constitution.<sup>[4]</sup> They also asserted claims under Puerto Rico's Constitution and P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, §§ 5141-42. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. § 1367.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>The defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings, under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c), was granted, and this appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review the grant of judgment on the pleadings de novo. <i>Mongeau v.

Here, we assume that all facts in the complaint are true. We must determine whether, on those facts, the plaintiffs would be able show \"above the speculative level\" that such a deprivation occurred. <i>Bell Atlantic,</i> 127 S.Ct. at 1965.</p>\n<p>This appeal centers on the plaintiffs' procedural due process claims.<sup>[7]</sup> The plaintiffs make an initial argument that the court failed to consider their procedural due process claim in its order granting the motion for judgment on the pleadings.<sup>[8]</sup> Although the dismissal order mentions the due process argument several times, the order does not analyze the claim. Nevertheless, we have considered the plaintiffs' procedural due process claim and find that it fails on the merits. <i>See </i><i>Torromeo v.
