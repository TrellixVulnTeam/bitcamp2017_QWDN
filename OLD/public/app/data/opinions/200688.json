Between 1991 and 1999, an\n\nemployee of appellant Special Olympics of Massachusetts, Inc.\n\n(SOMA),1 conducted a fraudulent fund-raising campaign – ostensibly\n\non    behalf of the organization – that raised more than $1 million.\n\nHe used most of the funds for personal expenses.                  SOMA filed a\n\nclaim with appellee Fireman's Fund Insurance Co. under an employee\n\nfidelity policy covering losses stemming from employee dishonesty.\n\nThe   insurer   disputed    coverage    and   initiated    this     declaratory\n\njudgment action.        On cross motions for summary judgment, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that the stolen funds belonged to the\n\nputative    donors    rather   than    SOMA   and   that   the    organization\n\ntherefore did not suffer a loss covered by the policy.                       It\n\nconsequently granted summary judgment for the insurer.               See 249 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 19 (D. Mass. 2003).          We agree with the district court's\n\nconclusion, but have chosen a slightly different path.\n\n                                  I. Background\n\n       Gerald Tenglund was hired in 1990 as an area manager for SOMA,\n\nwhose mission is to provide opportunities for high quality sports\n\ntraining and competition for Massachusetts athletes with mental\n\nretardation and other related disabilities.                A year later, he\n\nstarted a fund-raising campaign using SOMA's name but without the\n\norganization's       knowledge.       Although    area   managers    were   not\n\n\n       1\n       SOMA is an affiliate of Special Olympics International,\nwhich also is a party in this case.  For convenience, we refer\nprimarily to SOMA in our discussion.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fpermitted to conduct direct marketing activities, Tenglund hired\n\ntelemarketers to solicit funds.         He deposited the donated money\n\ninto an unauthorized checking account that he opened using SOMA's\n\ntaxpayer identification number. Between August 1992 and June 1999,\n\nTenglund deposited more than $1.1 million into the account and\n\nwithdrew all but $6,200.2    A small amount of the money was spent to\n\nfund authorized Special Olympics activities and to pay a stipend to\n\nthe telemarketers; the remainder was used solely for Tenglund's\n\npersonal expenses.\n\n     SOMA learned of the illicit fund-raising in April 1999 when\n\none of the donors contacted its state office about an improperly\n\nendorsed check that had been returned by her bank.         SOMA gained\n\ncontrol of the unauthorized account in late May 1999 and Tenglund\n\nwas terminated in July.        With the help of an auditor, SOMA\n\nsubsequently was able to determine the amount of money that had\n\npassed through the account since 1992.\n\n     During the relevant time period, SOMA was insured against\n\nlosses resulting from employee theft under crime insurance policies\n\nissued by Fireman's Fund.3    The policies indemnified SOMA for loss\n\nof \"Covered Property,\" including cash, attributable to \"Employee\n\ndishonesty,\" which was defined in relevant part as \"dishonest acts\n\n\n     2\n       The bank retained records for only seven years, and account\nactivity before August 1992 was therefore not available.\n     3\n       The policies were the same, but covered different time\nperiods.\n\n                                  -3-\n\fcommitted by an employee . . .         with the manifest intent\" to cause\n\nloss to the employer and to obtain financial benefit for the\n\nemployee or a third party.         See Coverage Form A at 1-2 ¶¶ A(1),(2),\n\nD(3).       The policies exclude \"indirect loss,\" which is defined in\n\nrelevant part as\n\n              Loss that is an indirect result of any act or\n              occurrence   covered    by   this   insurance\n              including, but not limited to, loss resulting\n              from:\n\n                   a. Your ability to realize income\n                   that you would have realized had\n                   there been no loss of, or loss from\n                   damage to, Covered Property.\n\nPolicy General Provisions at 1 ¶A(3).\n\n        SOMA submitted a proof of loss form that listed the amount at\n\nissue as $1,092,800.         Fireman's Fund denied the claim on the\n\ngrounds that (1) SOMA did not suffer a direct loss covered by the\n\npolicies, (2)Tenglund was not a covered employee, and (3) the\n\nnotice of loss was untimely.            We address only the first point\n\nbecause we agree with the district court's conclusion that SOMA did\n\nnot   experience     a   covered   loss,     a   determination   that   compels\n\njudgment for the insurer.4\n\n                               II. Discussion\n\n        We review a district court's grant of summary judgment de\n\nnovo, assessing the facts and inferences to be drawn from them in\n\n\n\n        4\n       The district court likewise did not address the other two\ngrounds.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fthe light most favorable to the non-moving party.        Sparks v.\n\nFidelity Nat'l Title Ins. Co., 294 F.3d 259, 265 (lst Cir. 2002).\n\nUnder Massachusetts law, which governs this diversity case, see\n\nLexington Ins. Co. v. Gen. Accident Ins. Co. of Am., 338 F.3d 42,\n\n46 (lst   Cir. 2003), we construe an insurance policy de novo under\n\nthe general rules of contract interpretation, see Brazas Sporting\n\nArms v. Am. Empire Surplus Lines Ins. Co., 220 F.3d 1, 4 (lst Cir.\n\n2000).    The \"baseline rule\" in Massachusetts is that \"insurance\n\ncontracts must be interpreted to reflect the intention of the\n\nparties as manifested by the policy language,\" Lexington Ins. Co.,\n\n338 F.3d at 47, and, absent ambiguity, \"'the words of an insurance\n\ncontract . . . \"must be construed in their usual and ordinary\n\nsense,\"'\" Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v. Weathermark Investments, 292 F.3d\n\n77, 80 (lst Cir. 2002) (citation omitted).\n\n     An insurance policy is to be read \"'as a whole \"without\n\naccording undue emphasis to any particular part over another.\"'\"\n\nMission Ins. Co. v. U.S. Fire Ins. Co., 401 Mass. 492, 497, 517\n\nN.E.2d 463, 466 (1988) (quoted in Utica Mut., 292 F.3d at 80)\n\n(citation omitted); see also Cochran v. Quest Software, 328 F.3d 1,\n\n7 (lst Cir. 2003) (\"[C]ourts may not single out an isolated word or\n\nphrase at the expense of the language as a whole.\"); USM Corp. v.\n\nArthur D. Little Sys., Inc., 28 Mass. App. Ct. 108, 116, 546 N.E.2d\n\n888, 893 (1989) (\"The object of the court is to construe the\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\fcontract as a whole, in a reasonable and practical way, consistent\n\nwith its language, background, and purpose.\").\n\n     In this case, the district court found that SOMA was not the\n\nowner of the money embezzled by Tenglund during his nearly eight-\n\nyear scheme and that the organization therefore had no loss and no\n\ncoverage under the policies.          In the court's view, the victims of\n\nTenglund's theft were the potential donors who were deceived into\n\nbelieving that their donations were supporting SOMA.                        The court\n\nrecognized that SOMA may have suffered a loss in reputation and\n\nperhaps a decrease in future donations as a result of Tenglund's\n\nfraud,   but    observed    that    such    a   loss    would      affect    only   an\n\nintangible     asset   that   was   not    covered      by   the    policies.       In\n\naddition, the court noted that SOMA would suffer a loss if it chose\n\nto   reimburse     the     deceived    donors,         but   stated     that     such\n\nreimbursement also would not trigger coverage because it would fall\n\nwithin the policies' \"indirect loss\" exclusion.\n\n     On appeal, SOMA presses its claim that, under principles of\n\nMassachusetts gift law, the funds turned over to Tenglund by the\n\ndonors were fully consummated gifts to the organization, bringing\n\nthe theft of this newly acquired property within the policies'\n\ncoverage.      SOMA argues that this loss was \"direct\" – it was money\n\ntaken from the organization itself – and it thus did not fall\n\nwithin the policy exclusion for \"indirect loss.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f     SOMA's theory may in part accurately state the law; if the\n\ndonations had become SOMA's property under state gift law before\n\nTenglund diverted    the   funds,    his   theft     would   appear    to   have\n\nresulted in a direct loss to the organization.            The technicalities\n\nof gift law are not, however, dispositive.            Even if Massachusetts\n\nlaw would view the donations as fully delivered and thus SOMA's\n\nproperty once they were deposited into the unauthorized bank\n\naccount – an issue we need not and do not consider – the question\n\nremains whether this loss of property, albeit direct, would fall\n\nwithin the policies' coverage.\n\n     Based on our reading of the fidelity policy as a whole, we\n\nconclude that it would not.        Pivotal to our determination is the\n\ndefinition of employee dishonesty that appears in Coverage Form A\n\nof the policy, at ¶D(3), which limits coverage to dishonest acts\n\n\"committed . . . with the manifest intent\" to cause the employer to\n\nsustain loss, as well as with the intent to obtain financial\n\nbenefit for the employee or a third party.\n\n     The manifest intent requirement was added to fidelity policies\n\nabout twenty-five    years   ago    to    narrow    the   scope   of   employee\n\ndishonesty provisions in the face of court decisions that had been\n\nbroadly construing coverage.       See, e.g., Resolution Trust Corp. v.\n\nFid. & Deposit Co. of Md., 205 F.3d 615, 638 (3d Cir. 2000);\n\nMichael   Keeley,   Employee   Dishonesty          Claims:   Discerning     the\n\nEmployee's Manifest Intent, 30 Tort & Ins. L.J. 915, 919 (Summer\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f1995).    The goal of the new language was to confine coverage to\n\nclassic episodes of employee dishonesty, a category in which\n\nembezzlement is the prime example. See, e.g., Gen. Analytics Corp.\n\nv. CNA Ins. Cos., 86 F.3d 51, 53-54 (4th Cir. 1996) (employee\n\ndishonesty     policies   are   \"designed    to   provide   coverage   for   a\n\nspecific type of loss characterized by embezzlement, which involves\n\nthe direct theft of money\"); Keeley, supra, at 919, 924.\n\n     The precise meaning of the phrase has remained somewhat\n\nelusive, however, engendering much discussion about the necessary\n\nlevel of culpability; the debate centers on whether the employee\n\nmust specifically have desired to cause a loss to the employer, or\n\nwhether it is enough that a loss was substantially certain to\n\nresult from the dishonest conduct.          See Resolution Trust, 205 F.3d\n\nat 638-643 (comparing the two \"manifest intent\" approaches to the\n\nconcepts of general intent and specific intent in criminal and tort\n\nlaw); Keeley, supra, at 916; Christopher Kirwan, Mischief or\n\n\"Manifest Intent\"? Looking for Employee Dishonesty in the Uncharted\n\nWorld of Fiduciary Misconduct, 30 Tort & Ins. L.J. 183, 186 (Fall\n\n1994).\n\n     That debate is not pertinent here, however, other than to\n\nconfirm that, at the very least, covered employee misconduct must\n\nreflect some level of intent to cause a loss to the employer.\n\nHere, by contrast, the facts reveal a scheme that was carefully\n\ncrafted   to    bypass    the   insured     entirely;   although   Tenglund\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fcapitalized on the organization's sympathetic charitable mission,\n\nhis deception was directed at individual donors.             And, unlike the\n\nclassic case of embezzlement, in which the employer's existing\n\nfunds     are    diminished    by     the   dishonest   employee's    conduct,\n\nTenglund's scheme generated new funds, unanticipated by SOMA,\n\nspecifically for his own benefit. This scenario falls outside even\n\na broad interpretation of what it means for an employee to have\n\n\"manifest intent to . . . [c]ause [the employer] to sustain loss.\"\n\nContrary to SOMA's assertion, Tenglund's obvious intention to\n\nenrich himself reflects neither an expectation that his dishonesty\n\nwould inflict a loss on his employer nor the inevitability of such\n\nan outcome.\n\n        SOMA    acknowledges   that    courts   typically   deem   third-party\n\nlosses as outside the coverage of fidelity policies, see, e.g.,\n\nLynch Props., Inc. v. Potomac Ins. Co. of Ill., 140 F.3d 622, 624\n\n(5th Cir. 1998) (no coverage where employee misappropriated funds\n\nfrom the personal account of a client and not from the covered\n\nemployer); Cont'l Cas. Co. v. First Nat'l Bank of Temple, 116 F.2d\n\n885, 887 (5th Cir. 1941) (employees' diversion of new bank deposits\n\nto cover prior thefts would be losses of third parties and not the\n\nbank \"if the money actually went into the bank . . . and the bank\n\ndid not suffer diminution of its assets\"); Cont'l Bank, N.A. v.\n\nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 164 Misc.2d 885, 889, 626 N.Y.S.2d 385, 388\n\n(N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1995)(\"Coverage was not triggered because the loss\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fresulted from transactions in a customer's account.\"), but it seeks\n\nto distinguish the cases so holding from the present circumstances\n\nby emphasizing that Tenglund's theft was of money nominally SOMA's.\n\n      With respect to intent, however, these cases are equivalent in\n\nthat the dishonest employees' misappropriations were structured to\n\navoid diminishing the assets of their employers, undoubtedly in\n\npart to minimize the risk of detection. See, e.g., Lynch Props.,\n\nInc. v. Potomac Ins. Co. of Ill., 962 F. Supp. 956, 962 (N.D. Tex.\n\n1996), aff'd, 140 F.3d 622 (5th Cir. 1998) (\"All inferences from\n\n[the employee's] behavior indicate that she did not want [her\n\nemployer] involved in, or harmed by, her embezzlement.\"); Cont'l\n\nBank, 164 Misc.2d at 888, 626 N.Y.S.2d at 387 (\"The manifest intent\n\nof   these   scoundrels   was   to   make   money,   not   to   cause   [their\n\nemployer] to lose money.\"). As in these other cases, Tenglund used\n\nhis employment both to design and to mask his artifice, but his\n\nfinancial target was the funds of outsiders.               Even if a legal\n\ntechnicality had converted the funds to SOMA's ownership in the\n\ncourse of the fraud, the character of the deception – the \"intent\"\n\n– would have remained unchanged.\n\n      We acknowledge that Tenglund's fraudulent activity may, in\n\nfact, have had a financial impact on SOMA either by reducing\n\ngenuine donations that would have been made if the money had not\n\nalready been \"contributed,\" or by tainting subsequent fund-raising\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fefforts by SOMA.   While we are sympathetic to SOMA's concern for\n\nits good name, we are constrained by the confines of the policies.\n\n      In sum, SOMA's fidelity insurance policies, consistent with\n\nthe industry standard, contained provisions that unambiguously\n\nlimited coverage to episodes of employee dishonesty that involved\n\nconduct intended to lead to a diminution in the insured's assets.\n\nSOMA offers no facts that would permit a factfinder to conclude that\n\nTenglund's fraudulent scheme was directed at the organization's\n\nresources.   Without any evidence of such \"manifest intent,\" SOMA is\n\nunable to prove a loss within the coverage of the policy.       The\n\ndistrict court therefore properly granted summary judgment for\n\nFireman's Fund.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

In the court's view, the victims of Tenglund's theft were the potential donors who were deceived into believing that their donations were supporting SOMA. The court recognized that SOMA may have suffered a loss in reputation and perhaps a decrease in future donations as a result of Tenglund's fraud, but observed that such a loss would affect only an intangible asset that was not covered by the policies. In addition, the court noted that SOMA would suffer a loss if it chose to reimburse the deceived donors, but stated that such reimbursement also would not trigger coverage because it would fall within the policies' \"indirect loss\" exclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, SOMA presses its claim that, under principles of Massachusetts gift law, the funds turned over to Tenglund by the donors were fully consummated gifts to the organization, bringing the theft of this newly acquired property within the policies' coverage. SOMA argues that this loss was \"direct\" &#8212; it was money taken from the organization itself &#8212; and it thus did not fall within the policy exclusion for \"indirect loss.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SOMA's theory may in part accurately state the law; if the donations had become SOMA's property under state gift law before Tenglund diverted the funds, his theft would appear to have resulted in a direct loss to the organization. The technicalities of gift law are not, however, dispositive. Even if Massachusetts law would view the donations as fully delivered and thus SOMA's property once they were deposited into the unauthorized bank account &#8212; an issue we need not and do not consider &#8212; the question remains whether this loss of property, albeit direct, would fall within the policies' coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on our reading of the fidelity policy as a whole, we conclude that it would not. Pivotal to our determination is the definition of employee dishonesty that appears in Coverage Form A of the policy, at &#182; D(3), which limits coverage to dishonest acts \"committed ... with the manifest intent\" to cause the employer to sustain loss, as well as with the intent to obtain financial benefit for the employee or a third party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The manifest intent requirement was added to fidelity policies about twenty-five years ago to narrow the scope of employee dishonesty provisions in the face of court decisions that had been broadly construing coverage. <i>See, e.g., Resolution Trust Corp. v. Fid. &amp; Deposit Co. of Md.,</i> 205 F.3d 615, 638 (3d Cir.2000); Michael Keeley, <i>Employee Dishonesty Claims: Discerning the Employee's Manifest Intent,</i> 30 Tort &amp; Ins. L.J. 915, 919 (Summer 1995). The goal of the new language was to confine coverage to classic episodes of employee dishonesty, a category in which embezzlement is the prime example. <i>See, e.g., Gen. Analytics Corp. v. CNA Ins. Cos.,</i> 86 F.3d 51, 53-54 (4th Cir.1996) (employee dishonesty policies are \"designed to provide coverage for a specific type of loss characterized by embezzlement, which involves the direct theft of money\"); Keeley, <i>supra,</i> at 919, 924.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precise meaning of the phrase has remained somewhat elusive, however, engendering much discussion about the necessary level of culpability; the debate centers on whether the employee must specifically have desired to cause a loss to the employer, or whether it is enough that a loss was substantially certain to result from the dishonest conduct. <i>See Resolution Trust,</i> 205 F.3d at 638-643 (comparing the two \"manifest intent\" approaches to the concepts of general intent and specific intent in criminal and tort law); Keeley, <i>supra,</i> at 916; Christopher Kirwan, <i>Mischief or \"Manifest Intent\"? Looking for Employee Dishonesty in the</i> <i>Uncharted World of Fiduciary Misconduct,</i> 30 Tort &amp; Ins. L.J. 183, 186 (Fall 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That debate is not pertinent here, however, other than to confirm that, at the very least, covered employee misconduct must reflect some level of intent to cause a loss to the employer. Here, by contrast, the facts reveal a scheme that was carefully crafted to bypass the insured entirely; although Tenglund capitalized on the organization's sympathetic charitable mission, his deception was directed at individual donors. And, unlike the classic case of embezzlement, in which the employer's existing funds are diminished by the dishonest employee's conduct, Tenglund's scheme generated new funds, unanticipated by SOMA, specifically for his own benefit. This scenario falls outside even a broad interpretation of what it means for an employee to have \"manifest intent to ... [c]ause [the employer] to sustain loss.\" Contrary to SOMA's assertion, Tenglund's obvious intention to enrich himself reflects neither an expectation that his dishonesty would inflict a loss on his employer nor the inevitability of such an outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SOMA acknowledges that courts typically deem third-party losses as outside the coverage of fidelity policies, <i>see, e.g., Lynch Props., Inc. v. Potomac Ins. Co. of Ill.,</i> 140 F.3d 622, 624 (5th Cir.1998) (no coverage where employee misappropriated funds from the personal account of a client and not from the covered employer); <i>Cont'l Cas. Co. v. First Nat'l Bank of Temple,</i> 116 F.2d 885, 887 (5th Cir.1941) (employees' diversion of new bank deposits to cover prior thefts would be losses of third parties and not the bank \"if the money actually went into the bank ... and the bank did not suffer diminution of its assets\"); <i>Cont'l Bank, N.A. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.,</i> 164 Misc.2d 885, 889, 626 N.Y.S.2d 385, 388 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1995) (\"Coverage was not triggered because the loss resulted from transactions in a customer's account.\"), but it seeks to distinguish the cases so holding from the present circumstances by emphasizing that Tenglund's theft was of money nominally SOMA's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to intent, however, these cases are equivalent in that the dishonest employees' misappropriations were structured to avoid diminishing the assets of their employers, undoubtedly in part to minimize the risk of detection. <i>See, e.g., Lynch Props., Inc. v. Potomac Ins. Co. of Ill.,</i> 962 F.Supp. 956, 962 (N.D.Tex.1996), <i>aff'd,</i> 140 F.3d 622 (5th Cir.1998) (\"All inferences from [the employee's] behavior indicate that she did not want [her employer] involved in, or harmed by, her embezzlement.\"); <i>Cont'l Bank,</i> 164 Misc.2d at 888, 626 N.Y.S.2d at 387 (\"The manifest intent of these scoundrels was to make money, not to cause [their employer] to lose money.\"). As in these other cases, Tenglund used his employment both to design and to mask his artifice, but his financial target was the funds of outsiders. Even if a legal technicality had converted the funds to SOMA's ownership in the course of the fraud, the character of the deception &#8212; the \"intent\" &#8212; would have remained unchanged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that Tenglund's fraudulent activity may, in fact, have had a financial impact on SOMA either by reducing genuine donations that would have been made if the money had not already been \"contributed,\" or by tainting subsequent fund-raising efforts by SOMA. While we are sympathetic to SOMA's concern for its good name, we are constrained by the confines of the policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, SOMA's fidelity insurance policies, consistent with the industry standard, contained provisions that unambiguously limited coverage to episodes of employee dishonesty that involved conduct intended to lead to a diminution in the insured's assets. SOMA offers no facts that would permit a factfinder to conclude that Tenglund's fraudulent scheme was directed at the organization's resources. Without any evidence of such \"manifest intent,\" SOMA is unable to prove a loss within the coverage of the policy. The district court therefore properly granted summary judgment for Fireman's Fund.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> SOMA is an affiliate of Special Olympics International, which also is a party in this case.

The insurer disputed coverage and initiated this declaratory judgment action.

A year later, he started a fund-raising campaign using SOMA's name but without the organization's knowledge. Although area managers were not permitted to conduct direct marketing activities, Tenglund hired telemarketers to solicit funds. He deposited the donated money into an unauthorized checking account that he opened using SOMA's taxpayer identification number. Between August 1992 and June 1999, Tenglund deposited more than $1.1 million into the account and withdrew all but $6,200.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> A small amount of the money was spent to fund authorized Special Olympics activities and to pay a stipend to the telemarketers; the remainder was used solely for Tenglund's personal expenses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SOMA learned of the illicit fund-raising in April 1999 when one of the donors contacted its state office about an improperly endorsed check that had been returned by her bank. SOMA gained control of the unauthorized account in late May 1999 and Tenglund was terminated in July. With the help of an auditor, SOMA subsequently was able to determine the amount of money that had passed through the account since 1992.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the relevant time period, SOMA was insured against losses resulting from employee theft under crime insurance policies issued by Fireman's Fund.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The policies indemnified SOMA for loss of \"Covered Property,\" including cash, attributable to \"Employee dishonesty,\" which was defined in relevant part as \"dishonest acts committed by an employee... with the manifest intent\" to cause loss to the employer and to obtain financial benefit for the employee or a third party. <i>See</i> Coverage Form A at 1-2 &#182;&#182; A(1), (2), D(3).

Even if Massachusetts law would view the donations as fully delivered and thus SOMA's property once they were deposited into the unauthorized bank account &#8212; an issue we need not and do not consider &#8212; the question remains whether this loss of property, albeit direct, would fall within the policies' coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on our reading of the fidelity policy as a whole, we conclude that it would not. Pivotal to our determination is the definition of employee dishonesty that appears in Coverage Form A of the policy, at &#182; D(3), which limits coverage to dishonest acts \"committed ... with the manifest intent\" to cause the employer to sustain loss, as well as with the intent to obtain financial benefit for the employee or a third party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The manifest intent requirement was added to fidelity policies about twenty-five years ago to narrow the scope of employee dishonesty provisions in the face of court decisions that had been broadly construing coverage. <i>See, e.g., Resolution Trust Corp. v. Fid. &amp; Deposit Co. of Md.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767887\"><a href=\"/opinion/767887/resolution-trust-corporation-as-receiver-for-city-savings-fsb-in/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">615</span></a></span>, 638 (3d Cir.2000); Michael Keeley, <i>Employee Dishonesty Claims: Discerning the Employee's Manifest Intent,</i> 30 Tort &amp; Ins. L.J. 915, 919 (Summer 1995). The goal of the new language was to confine coverage to classic episodes of employee dishonesty, a category in which embezzlement is the prime example. <i>See, e.g., Gen. Analytics Corp. v. CNA Ins. Cos.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"719682\"><a href=\"/opinion/719682/general-analytics-corporation-v-cna-insurance-companies-dba-valley/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 53-54 (4th Cir.1996) (employee dishonesty policies are \"designed to provide coverage for a specific type of loss characterized by embezzlement, which involves the direct theft of money\"); Keeley, <i>supra,</i> at 919, 924.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The precise meaning of the phrase has remained somewhat elusive, however, engendering much discussion about the necessary level of culpability; the debate centers on whether the employee must specifically have desired to cause a loss to the employer, or whether it is enough that a loss was substantially certain to result from the dishonest conduct. <i>See Resolution Trust,</i> 205 F.3d at 638-643 (comparing the two \"manifest intent\" approaches to the concepts of general intent and specific intent in criminal and tort law); Keeley, <i>supra,</i> at 916; Christopher Kirwan, <i>Mischief or \"Manifest Intent\"? Looking for Employee Dishonesty in the</i> <i>Uncharted World of Fiduciary Misconduct,</i> 30 Tort &amp; Ins. L.J. 183, 186 (Fall 1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That debate is not pertinent here, however, other than to confirm that, at the very least, covered employee misconduct must reflect some level of intent to cause a loss to the employer. Here, by contrast, the facts reveal a scheme that was carefully crafted to bypass the insured entirely; although Tenglund capitalized on the organization's sympathetic charitable mission, his deception was directed at individual donors. And, unlike the classic case of embezzlement, in which the employer's existing funds are diminished by the dishonest employee's conduct, Tenglund's scheme generated new funds, unanticipated by SOMA, specifically for his own benefit. This scenario falls outside even a broad interpretation of what it means for an employee to have \"manifest intent to ... [c]ause [the employer] to sustain loss.\" Contrary to SOMA's assertion, Tenglund's obvious intention to enrich himself reflects neither an expectation that his dishonesty would inflict a loss on his employer nor the inevitability of such an outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SOMA acknowledges that courts typically deem third-party losses as outside the coverage of fidelity policies, <i>see, e.g., Lynch Props., Inc. v. Potomac Ins. Co. of Ill.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></span>, 624 (5th Cir.1998) (no coverage where employee misappropriated funds from the personal account of a client and not from the covered employer); <i>Cont'l Cas. Co. v. First Nat'l Bank of Temple,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1508553\"><a href=\"/opinion/1508553/continental-casualty-co-v-first-nat-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span>, 887 (5th Cir.1941) (employees' diversion of new bank deposits to cover prior thefts would be losses of third parties and not the bank \"if the money actually went into the bank ... and the bank did not suffer diminution of its assets\"); <i>Cont'l Bank, N.A. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Misc. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></span>, 889, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.Y.S.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></span>, 388 (N.Y.Sup.Ct.1995) (\"Coverage was not triggered because the loss resulted from transactions in a customer's account.\"), but it seeks to distinguish the cases so holding from the present circumstances by emphasizing that Tenglund's theft was of money nominally SOMA's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to intent, however, these cases are equivalent in that the dishonest employees' misappropriations were structured to avoid diminishing the assets of their employers, undoubtedly in part to minimize the risk of detection. <i>See, e.g., Lynch Props., Inc. v. Potomac Ins. Co. of Ill.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2311484\"><a href=\"/opinion/2311484/lynch-properties-inc-v-potomac-ins-co-of-illinois/\"><span class=\"volume\">962</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">956</span></a></span>, 962 (N.D.Tex.1996), <i>aff'd,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></span> (5th Cir.1998) (\"All inferences from [the employee's] behavior indicate that she did not want [her employer] involved in, or harmed by, her embezzlement.\"); <i>Cont'l Bank,</i> 164 Misc.2d at 888, 626 N.Y.S.2d at 387 (\"The manifest intent of these scoundrels was to make money, not to cause [their employer] to lose money.\"). As in these other cases, Tenglund used his employment both to design and to mask his artifice, but his financial target was the funds of outsiders. Even if a legal technicality had converted the funds to SOMA's ownership in the course of the fraud, the character of the deception &#8212; the \"intent\" &#8212; would have remained unchanged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that Tenglund's fraudulent activity may, in fact, have had a financial impact on SOMA either by reducing genuine donations that would have been made if the money had not already been \"contributed,\" or by tainting subsequent fund-raising efforts by SOMA. While we are sympathetic to SOMA's concern for its good name, we are constrained by the confines of the policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, SOMA's fidelity insurance policies, consistent with the industry standard, contained provisions that unambiguously limited coverage to episodes of employee dishonesty that involved conduct intended to lead to a diminution in the insured's assets. SOMA offers no facts that would permit a factfinder to conclude that Tenglund's fraudulent scheme was directed at the organization's resources. Without any evidence of such \"manifest intent,\" SOMA is unable to prove a loss within the coverage of the policy. The district court therefore properly granted summary judgment for Fireman's Fund.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> SOMA is an affiliate of Special Olympics International, which also is a party in this case.
