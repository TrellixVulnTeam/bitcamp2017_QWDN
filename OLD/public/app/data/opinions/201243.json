The petitioner, Azzedine Lattab,\n\nis an Algerian national.                His case presents a gallimaufry of\n\nissues, including yet another in the series of retroactivity\n\nproblems that have trailed Congress's enactment of the Illegal\n\nImmigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.\n\nL. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-598 (IIRIRA).                  Broadly stated, Lattab —\n\nwith    the   able    assistance       of    the    amicus   —   attacks    an   IIRIRA\n\nprovision, codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5), which mandates the\n\nreinstatement of a prior deportation order (or removal order — the\n\nterms are interchangeable on these facts) when an alien subject to\n\nsuch an order is found to have reentered the country illegally.                     He\n\nargues     that      the     reinstatement         provision     is    impermissibly\n\nretroactive as applied to his case; that the regulatory procedure\n\nimplementing it is ultra vires; and that, in all events, the\n\nprovision deprives illegally reentering aliens of procedural due\n\nprocess.       As    a     fallback,    he    asserts     that   the   reinstatement\n\nprovision ought not to have been invoked in this instance because\n\nanother statute trumped its operation.                   Concluding, as we do, that\n\nthis asseverational array lacks force, we deny and dismiss the\n\npetition for review.\n\nI.     THE NEW REINSTATEMENT PROVISION\n\n              We    begin     by   limning         the   parameters    of    the    new\n\nreinstatement provision.               Among many other innovations, IIRIRA\n\nrepealed the former reinstatement provision, section 242(f) of the\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fImmigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1252(f) (repealed\n\n1996),   and   enacted    a   new   reinstatement          provision    at   section\n\n241(a)(5), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(a)(5).1               Section 241(a)(5) provides:\n\n            If the Attorney General finds that an alien\n            has reentered the United States illegally\n            after having been removed or having departed\n            voluntarily, under an order of removal, the\n            prior order of removal is reinstated from its\n            original date and is not subject to being\n            reopened or reviewed, the alien is not\n            eligible and may not apply for any relief\n            under [the INA], and the alien shall be\n            removed under the prior order at any time\n            after the reentry.\n\n            This provision took effect on April 1, 1997.                  It altered\n\npreexisting law in at least three salient respects.                    First, under\n\nthe old regime only illegal reentrants who had previously been\n\ndeported on certain specified grounds (e.g., conviction for an\n\naggravated     felony)    were      subject       to     having   their      original\n\ndeportation orders reinstated.          Under section 241(a)(5), however,\n\nall illegal reentrants now face the prospect of such reinstatement.\n\nSee Arevalo v. Ashcroft, 344 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2003).                      Second,\n\nunder the earlier system an alien had a right to a hearing,\n\npresided over by an immigration judge, before reinstatement of the\n\nprior    deportation     order   became      a    fait    accompli.       Under   the\n\n\n     1\n      For better or worse, it is customary when discussing\nimmigration law to refer to sections of the INA and the various\nstatutes amending it by public law section number rather than\nUnited States Code section number.       We will adhere to this\nconvention and provide parallel citations to the relevant code\nprovisions only when referring to statutory sections for the first\ntime.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fregulations implementing section 241(a)(5), however, there is no\n\nlonger a right to such a hearing (or to any hearing, for that\n\nmatter).     See 8 C.F.R. § 241.8.    Third, preexisting law allowed an\n\nillegal reentrant to attempt to fend off execution of a reinstated\n\ndeportation order by petitioning for discretionary relief in the\n\nform of an adjustment of his status to that of an alien lawfully\n\nadmitted for permanent residence.          Conversely, section 241(a)(5)\n\npretermits an illegal reentrant's ability to apply for any relief\n\nunder the INA.     See Arevalo, 344 F.3d at 5.\n\nII.   THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n             We next recount the facts undergirding the case.        The\n\npetitioner first entered the United States on February 7, 1992, as\n\na tourist.    He overstayed his visa and remained here for some time.\n\nOn March 29, 1996, an immigration judge found him deportable but\n\nallowed him to depart voluntarily on or before June 27 of that\n\nyear.   The petitioner failed to comply — he did not leave the\n\nUnited States until August 23, 1996 — and that default caused the\n\nimmigration judge's ukase to mutate into a deportation order.        See\n\n8 C.F.R. § 243.5 (repealed 1997).             In the eyes of the law,\n\ntherefore, the petitioner's belated departure was tantamount to\n\nself-deportation.     Id.\n\n             While in the United States, the petitioner had become\n\nromantically involved with a United States citizen (he claims that\n\nthey had become engaged). He reentered the United States illegally\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fon March 1, 1997, and resumed this courtship.                      He and his fiancee\n\nwere married on July 5, 1999.\n\n              On     May   23,    2000,   the     petitioner's        wife    filed    an\n\n\"immediate         relative\"       petition      with     the       Immigration       and\n\nNaturalization Service (INS).2                  This petition was approved on\n\nAugust 28, 2002. That approval, standing alone, did not affect the\n\npetitioner's immigration status, but, rather, paved the way for a\n\npossible adjustment.             See INA § 245(i), 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i).                 To\n\nthat end, he immediately sought to have his status changed to that\n\nof   lawful    permanent         resident.       During      the   pendency    of   that\n\napplication,         the   INS    approved      the    petitioner's     request       for\n\ntemporary authorization to engage in employment.                      See 8 C.F.R. §\n\n274a.12(c).\n\n              On August 5, 2003, the petitioner endeavored to renew his\n\nemployment authorization.            While at the CIS office in Boston, an\n\nimmigration        officer   discovered         that   the    petitioner      had     been\n\ndeported      once    before.       He    was    taken    into     custody    and     soon\n\nthereafter ICE, relying on section 241(a)(5), reinstated the 1996\n\ndeportation order.\n\n\n      2\n      The Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub. L. 107-296, § 471,\n116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)),\nabolished the INS and transferred its duties to the Department of\nHomeland Security. The INS functions related to the processing of\napplications for adjustment of status now reside in the United\nStates Citizenship and Immigration Service (CIS). Responsibility\nfor immigration enforcement, including the authority to reinstate\nprior orders of deportation, lies with a separate sub-agency known\nas United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).\n\n                                           -5-\n\f            Dismayed by this chain of events, the petitioner sought\n\njudicial review.        His petition contends, inter alia, that the\n\ngovernment's attempt to apply section 241(a)(5) to his case has an\n\nimpermissibly retroactive effect; that the summary reinstatement of\n\nthe prior deportation order disregarded both statutorily mandated\n\nprocedures and the dictates of the Due Process Clause; and that in\n\nthe circumstances of this case, section 241(a)(5) must yield to a\n\ndifferent (allegedly conflicting) INA provision.             Because an order\n\nreinstating a prior removal order is \"the functional equivalent of\n\na final order of removal,\" Arevalo, 344 F.3d at 9, we have\n\njurisdiction to hear and determine these contentions under 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252.\n\nIII.   ANALYSIS\n\n            The petitioner and the amicus advance four principal\n\narguments.       We consider them in an order that roughly corresponds\n\nto the amount of energy that they have devoted to each.\n\n                            A.    Retroactivity.\n\n            The centerpiece of the petitioner's case is a claim that\n\napplication       of   section    241(a)(5)   to      his   circumstances   is\n\nimpermissibly retroactive.          Since IIRIRA took effect after his\n\nillegal reentry in 1997, this thesis runs, retroactive application\n\nof   the   new    reinstatement    proviso    would    violate   his   settled\n\nexpectation that he would be allowed to seek an adjustment of his\n\nimmigration status following his marriage.\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f            Whether application of a statute to a given situation is\n\nimpermissibly      retroactive       presents    a     quintessentially      legal\n\nquestion.        Judicial   review    is   de   novo    and,    accordingly,   the\n\nagency's views garner no special deference.               Arevalo, 344 F.3d at\n\n9-10 (explaining that \"courts, rather than agencies, are best\n\nequipped    to    make   the   constitutionally        tinged    judgment     calls\n\ninherent in retroactivity determinations\").                We proceed on that\n\nbasis.\n\n            There is no doubt that Congress has the raw power to\n\nenact statutes that operate retroactively.                See Landgraf v. USI\n\nFilm Prods., 511 U.S. 244, 267 (1994).                 But because retroactive\n\nlegislation has the potential to alter the consequences of actions\n\nalready taken, courts start with a presumption that Congress\n\nintends to legislate prospectively.             Id. at 272-73.      Congress can\n\novercome this presumption and give legislation a retroactive effect\n\nonly by clearly indicating its intent to do so.                 Id. at 268.\n\n            We analyze the possibility that Congress intended a\n\nstatute to apply retroactively under the rubric set forth in\n\nLandgraf. Initially, we decide whether Congress has clearly stated\n\nan intention to have the statute apply retrospectively.                     Id. at\n\n280; Arevalo, 344 F.3d at 10.              Although this prong of the test\n\nrequires Congress's intention to be unmistakable, our inquiry is\n\nnot limited to the statutory text but may include an examination of\n\nstandard ensigns of statutory construction, such as the statute's\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fstructure and legislative history.             See Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S.\n\n343, 355-57 (1999); see also Arevalo, 344 F.3d at 11-13 (examining\n\nthese factors in determining the sweep of section 241(a)(5), but\n\nnoting that \"the benchmark for finding unambiguous temporal scope\n\nis quite high\").       If this perscrutation leads to a firm conviction\n\nthat Congress intended the statute to have a specific temporal\n\nreach, the retroactivity analysis ends and we will apply the\n\nstatute in accordance with Congress's prescription. In the absence\n\nof such a directive, we will proceed to determine whether the\n\napplication in question would have an impermissibly retroactive\n\neffect.       Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280; Arevalo, 344 F.3d at 10-11.\n\nThat result obtains if the specified application would \"impair\n\nrights    a    party   possessed   when   he    acted,   increase   a   party's\n\nliability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to\n\ntransactions already completed.\"           Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280.         In\n\nthat event, the presumption that Congress did not intend the\n\nstatute to apply retrospectively will hold.              Arevalo, 344 F.3d at\n\n11.   Otherwise, retroactive application is permissible.                Id.\n\n              In the case at hand, the search for express congressional\n\nintent need not occupy us for long.             Three years ago, the Supreme\n\nCourt ruled that Congress did not specify the temporal reach of\n\nsection 304 of IIRIRA.       INS v. St. Cyr, 533 U.S. 289, 320 (2001).\n\nBuilding on that foundation, we concluded last year that section\n\n241(a)(5) shared this characteristic. Arevalo, 344 F.3d at 13. In\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fforming that conclusion, we carefully examined both the text and\n\nlegislative history of IIRIRA in general and section 241(a)(5) in\n\nparticular.       Id. at 11-13.       This exercise left us with the\n\nconviction that \"section 241(a)(5) is hopelessly unclear as to\n\nwhether it applies to those who illegally reentered the United\n\nStates before April 1, 1997.\"        Id. at 13.    This panel is bound by\n\nthat determination.      United States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d 1446, 1449\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).\n\n            The second step of the Landgraf pavane requires us to\n\ndetermine     whether   application     of   section    241(a)(5)    to    the\n\npetitioner's circumstances would have an impermissibly retroactive\n\neffect.      The logical starting point for this inquiry is the\n\nascertainment of what rights and justifiable expectations the\n\npetitioner may have had under the law as it existed immediately\n\nbefore IIRIRA's effective date.\n\n            The   law   did   not   change   between   the   date   when   the\n\npetitioner illegally reentered the country (March 1, 1997) and\n\nIIRIRA's effective date (April 1, 1997).          Under that regime, the\n\npetitioner was immediately deportable.         See 8 U.S.C. § 1227 (1994)\n\n(specifying grounds for deportation).          There is no indication in\n\nthe record that the petitioner ever sought, or qualified for,\n\nasylum.     From aught that appears, in the spring of 1997 he would\n\nnot have had any defense to deportation.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f             To be sure, at that time the petitioner would not have\n\nbeen subject to summary reinstatement of the prior deportation\n\norder.     Instead, deportability would have been determined in a new\n\nproceeding before an immigration judge.               See 8 C.F.R. § 242.23\n\n(repealed 1999). Pre-IIRIRA law would have allowed the petitioner,\n\ncoincident with the commencement of that new proceeding, to apply\n\nfor adjustment of his immigration status based upon his marriage,\n\nnotwithstanding     the   fact    that    he    had   reentered     the     country\n\nillegally.     INA § 245, 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i).\n\n             Given that template, IIRIRA worked relatively few changes\n\nin   the   petitioner's    situation.          Substantively,      he    was     still\n\nillegally in the country and still subject to deportation after the\n\nnew law took effect.        While section 241(a)(5) barred him from\n\napplying for any affirmative relief (such as an adjustment of\n\nstatus)     from   and    after   April        1,   1997,   that        change     was\n\ninconsequential because there was no relief for which petitioner\n\ncould then have qualified.        After all, his wedding did not occur\n\nuntil July 5, 1999 (over two years after IIRIRA took effect).\n\n             In fact, the only consequence that IIRIRA added to the\n\npetitioner's illegal reentry was procedural:                he was subject to\n\nhaving his prior deportation order peremptorily reinstated and was\n\nno longer entitled to a hearing before that reinstatement.                        That\n\nconsequence is insufficient to derail the application of the new\n\nstatute.     As a general rule, the application of new procedural\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fmechanisms to the adjudication of past conduct is not impermissibly\n\nretroactive.      Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 275.         More to the point, we\n\npreviously have held that this precise procedural change falls\n\nwithin that general rule, not within the long-odds exception to it.\n\nSee Arevalo, 344 F.3d at 13 (holding that \"although aliens subject\n\nto reinstatement of a previous deportation order had a right to .\n\n. . a hearing before the passage of the IIRIRA, . . . that right\n\nwas procedural and, therefore, can be taken away retroactively\").\n\nOther courts agree.        See, e.g., Ojeda-Terrazas v. Ashcroft, 290\n\nF.3d 292, 301-02 (5th Cir. 2002); Alvarez-Portillo v. Ashcroft, 280\n\nF.3d 858, 865 (8th Cir. 2002).\n\n            The    petitioner   nonetheless     maintains     that   section\n\n241(a)(5)   ought    not   be   applied   to   bar   his   application   for\n\nadjustment of status because at the time section 241(a)(5) took\n\neffect, he planned to marry a United States citizen and thus become\n\neligible for lawful permanent resident status.             He points to the\n\ngovernment's longstanding practice of allowing an alien illegally\n\npresent in the United States to seek adjustment of status following\n\nmarriage to a citizen and asserts that he was entitled to rely on\n\nthis praxis.      This assertion comprises more cry than wool.\n\n            A statute only has an impermissibly retroactive effect\n\nwhen it would change the legal consequences of actions actually\n\ntaken (or refrained from) prior to the statute's effective date.\n\nSee Landgraf, 511 U.S. at 280.            Inchoate plans to act in the\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\ffuture, even when made in anticipation of the legal consequences of\n\nthose future actions, do not convey the type of settled expectation\n\nthat retroactivity analysis seeks to protect.                               See id. at 269\n\n(noting     that   retroactive         application         of        a     statute       is   not\n\nimpermissible merely because that application \"upsets expectations\n\nbased in prior law\").            Because the petitioner did not marry (and\n\nthus, did not qualify for adjustment of status) until more than two\n\nyears after IIRIRA's effective date, he cannot validly complain\n\nabout   the    elimination       of    his    ability     to     apply       for     a    future\n\nadjustment of status.            The decisive datum is that the petitioner\n\nhad no sufficiently settled expectation that he could adjust his\n\nstatus at the time section 241(a)(5) took effect, because he was\n\nnot yet married.         Thus, applying that provision to the petitioner\n\nis not impermissibly retroactive.\n\n              There are two loose ends.             First, the petitioner asserts\n\nthat because       he    applied      for    adjustment     of           status    before     the\n\ngovernment actually reinstated the prior order of deportation,\n\nsection 241(a)(5)'s bar to relief ought not to apply.                             We deem this\n\nargument squarely foreclosed by the text of the statute.                                 Section\n\n241(a)(5)     subjects      an   illegal      reentrant         to       three    independent\n\nconsequences:           reinstatement        of    the   prior       deportation          order,\n\nineligibility for any relief, and removal.                  Grammatically, section\n\n241(a)(5) does not make ineligibility for relief dependent upon\n\nreinstatement of the prior deportation order.                        And even if it did,\n\n\n                                            -12-\n\fsection 241(a)(5) expressly makes reinstatement retroactive to the\n\ndate of the original deportation order.3\n\n             The second loose end is a bit different.          In a post-\n\nargument letter, see Fed. R. App. P. 28(j); 1st Cir. R. 28(j), the\n\npetitioner attempted to embrace the recent decision in Perez-\n\nGonzalez v. Ashcroft, ___ F.3d ___ (9th Cir. 2004) [2004 WL\n\n1801894].    That case involved the effect of a pending application\n\nfor permission to reenter the country, filed after the petitioner\n\nillegally    reentered,   on   the    relief   bar   erected   by   section\n\n241(a)(5).    The Ninth Circuit stated that if the application were\n\napproved, that approval would cure the illegal reentry and section\n\n241(a)(5) would not apply.      Id. at ___ [2004 WL 1801894, at *11].\n\nThe petitioner now seeks to avail himself of this possible escape\n\nhatch.\n\n            In this case, unlike in Perez-Gonzalez, the petitioner\n\ndid not argue that approval of an application for permission to\n\nreenter would cure his illegal reentry; nor did he argue, by\n\nanalogy, that the government's approval of his wife's \"immediate\n\nrelative\" petition should be accorded a similar effect.              It is\n\nreadily apparent, then, that Perez-Gonzalez turns on a legal theory\n\nnever explored either in the petitioner's briefs to this court or\n\n\n\n     3\n      The petitioner's sole support for this argument derives from\nthe decision in Prado Hernandez v. Reno, 86 F. Supp. 2d 1037 (W.D.\nWash. 1999). We find that decision unpersuasive and decline to\nfollow it.\n\n                                     -13-\n\fat oral argument.      The usual rule, applicable here, is that new\n\ntheories cannot be raised in a post-argument Rule 28(j) filing.\n\nUnited States v. Nason, 9 F.3d 155, 163 (1st Cir. 1993).                It is\n\narguable that this theory has been waived; at best, it has been\n\nforfeited.     See Bennett v. City of Holyoke, 362 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n             Of course, a forfeited argument occasionally can be\n\nresurrected under the plain error doctrine.              See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).                  But that\n\ndoctrine contains fairly rigorous criteria.             See, e.g., id.     It\n\nrequires, at a bare minimum, that the complaining party point to a\n\n\"clear or obvious\" error.      Id.   Here, however, we have grave doubts\n\nabout the correctness of the Perez-Gonzalez court's conclusion. It\n\nseems to us that permission to reenter, like adjustment of status,\n\nis relief under the INA, which section 241(a)(5) precludes an\n\nillegal reentrant from seeking.       Furthermore, we find it difficult\n\nto accept the Ninth Circuit's heavy reliance on regulations that\n\nantedate IIRIRA in interpreting the reach of section 241(a)(5). We\n\nare, therefore, unable to find a clear or obvious error in ICE's\n\ndecisionmaking.\n\n             Although that ends this phase of our analysis, we add a\n\ncoda.    We hold today only that application of section 241(a)(5) to\n\ndeprive   an   alien   who   illegally      reentered   the   country   before\n\nIIRIRA's effective date of the ability to apply for relief for\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fwhich the alien did not theretofore qualify is not impermissibly\n\nretroactive.      We    do   not    purport    to    decide   the   retroactive\n\napplication of section 241(a)(5) to all aliens who reentered\n\nillegally before April 1, 1997, nor do we address the case of an\n\nalien illegally present in the United States who had a potential\n\ndefense to deportation before IIRIRA took effect but had not yet\n\napplied for relief when IIRIRA eliminated that defense.                  We leave\n\nthese questions for future cases, pausing only to remind the reader\n\nthat application of retroactivity principles requires \"commonsense,\n\nfunctional judgment[s],\" Hadix, 527 U.S. at 357, and that each case\n\nshould be assessed on its own facts.\n\n                             B.     Ultra Vires.\n\n            Having     determined    that     the    application    of    section\n\n241(a)(5) to the petitioner's circumstances does not have an\n\nimpermissibly retroactive effect, we next consider the petitioner's\n\nclaim that 8 C.F.R. § 241.8, which implements section 241(a)(5), is\n\nat variance with the procedures stipulated in INA § 240, 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1229a.    This question engenders review under a familiar two-part\n\nparadigm.    See generally INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526 U.S. 415, 424\n\n(1999); Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,\n\n467 U.S. 837, 842-43 (1984).             Under that paradigm, we first\n\ndetermine whether Congress has spoken clearly on the precise\n\nquestion.   Chevron, 467 U.S. at 842-43.            If it has, we will enforce\n\nCongress's instructions.      Id. at 842.      If it has not, we will defer\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fto the administering agency's construction of the statute so long\n\nas that construction is reasonable.         Id. at 843.\n\n             The challenged regulation provides for reinstatement of\n\na prior deportation order without first affording an alien a\n\nhearing before an immigration judge.            8 C.F.R. § 241.8.       The\n\npetitioner contrasts this spartan regime with INA § 240, which sets\n\nforth the procedures to be followed when determining removability\n\nin the first instance.    In general, section 240 entitles aliens to\n\nbe represented by counsel, to be heard by an immigration judge, to\n\nadduce evidence, and to cross-examine adverse witnesses.               That\n\nsection further provides:\n\n             Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, a\n             proceeding under this section shall be the\n             sole and exclusive procedure for determining\n             whether an alien may be . . . removed from the\n             United States . . . .\n\n8   U.S.C.   §   1229a(a)(3).       The   petitioner   says   that   summary\n\nreinstatement of a deportation order sets up a parallel procedure\n\nfor removal and thus conflicts with the quoted statute.              In the\n\npetitioner's view, this renders the regulation ultra vires.\n\n             The government retorts that summary reinstatement of a\n\ndeportation order is not beyond the Attorney General's statutory\n\nauthority     because   INA     §   241(a)(5)    provides     an   explicit,\n\ncongressionally sanctioned alternative to the otherwise exclusive\n\nprocedure delineated in section 240.            The government seeds its\n\nargument with persistent references to the legislative history.\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fThose references indicate (or so the government says) that Congress\n\nintended aliens who reentered the country illegally after once\n\nhaving been deported to be treated as a separate class and removed\n\nexpeditiously.     See, e.g., H.R. Rep. No. 104-469, pt. 1, at 13\n\n(1996) (explaining that \"if aliens who are ordered removed . . .\n\nseek reentry they are subject to immediate removal under the prior\n\norder\").\n\n           The petitioner's argument has a veneer of plausibility.\n\nAfter all, the decision to reinstate a prior deportation order is\n\nto some extent a determination as to whether an alien may be\n\nremoved from the United States.           Cf. Arevalo, 344 F.3d at 9\n\n(holding, albeit in the context of appellate jurisdiction, that\n\n\"reinstatement itself operates as the functional equivalent of a\n\nfinal order of removal\").        This carapace, however, is easily\n\npierced.   Considering section 240 in the context of the INA as a\n\nwhole, we conclude that its application to the reinstatement of\n\nearlier deportation orders is at best uncertain.\n\n           For one thing, section 240 is primarily concerned with\n\nproceedings   to   determine    whether    aliens   are   excludable   or\n\ndeportable on one of the bases enumerated in INA §§ 212 and 237, 8\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1182 and 1227.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(a)(2) (\"An alien\n\nplaced in proceedings under this section may be charged with any\n\napplicable ground of inadmissibility under [section 212] or any\n\nground of deportability under [section 237].\").            In contrast,\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fsection 241 deals specifically with aliens who already have been\n\nordered removed, and the placement of the reinstatement provision\n\nin a separate section logically can be understood as indicating a\n\ncongressional    intention     to   treat     reinstatement   determinations\n\ndifferently from first-instance determinations of removability.\n\nCf. Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 288-91 (2001) (relying in\n\npart on the separation of substantive standards and regulatory\n\nauthority into different sections of a single statute to find that\n\nCongress intended to create a private right of action to enforce\n\nthe former, but not the latter).\n\n           For another thing, when Congress enacted IIRIRA, it\n\nplainly   was   dissatisfied    with    the    performance    of   the   former\n\nreinstatement    provision,     which    had    \"fallen   into     desuetude.\"\n\nCastro-Cortez v. INS, 239 F.3d 1037, 1040 n.1 (9th Cir. 2001).\n\nCongress apparently believed that the reinstatement regime should\n\nbe altered dramatically, Alvarez-Portillo, 280 F.3d at 863, and\n\nreformed to function swiftly and simply.           See, e.g., S. Rep. 104-\n\n249, at 7 (1995) (\"Aliens who violate U.S. Immigration law should\n\nbe removed from this country as soon as possible.\"); H.R. Rep. No.\n\n104-469, supra, at 134 (calling pre-IIRIRA procedures \"cumbersome\n\nand duplicative,\" and positing that IIRIRA would correct these\n\nflaws).   We think it unarguable that Congress intended IIRIRA to\n\nstrengthen the reinstatement provision and to make it operate more\n\nefficiently.    Viewed against this backdrop, it seems reasonable\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fthat, rather than spelling out procedural changes by statute,\n\nCongress may have expected the Attorney General to reevaluate the\n\nimplementation of the reinstatement statute and to set in place a\n\nregulatory regimen that would further these goals.\n\n           That     said,     we     find    the     government's     statutory\n\ninterpretation no more compelling.           The text of section 241(a)(5)\n\nsimply will not bear the weight that the Attorney General tries to\n\npile upon it.      To say, as does section 241(a)(5), that an alien\n\n\"shall be removed under the prior order at any time after . . .\n\nreentry\" says      nothing    about   how    the   government   may    go   about\n\ndetermining either the existence of a prior order or the fact of an\n\nillegal reentry.         See Castro-Cortez, 239 F.3d at 1048.          Nor does\n\nsection 241(a)(5)'s bar on seeking relief from reinstatement of an\n\nearlier order necessarily indicate an intention that the prior\n\norder be reinstated peremptorily.\n\n           The INA, taken as a whole, highlights this lack of\n\ncertitude.        When    compared    with   other    provisions      explicitly\n\nauthorizing alternative procedures, section 241(a)(5) looks even\n\nless like an explicit authorization.           For example, section 235 of\n\nthe INA, 8 U.S.C. § 1225, provides for summary removal proceedings\n\nfor certain aliens upon their arrival in the United States.                    To\n\ntake one case, that section provides that aliens who arrive without\n\nproper documentation shall be removed \"without further hearing or\n\nreview.\"     Id. § 1225(b)(1)(i).       In a similar vein, stowaways are\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fexpressly ineligible for \"a hearing under [section 240].\"            Id. §\n\n1225(a)(2). The absence of comparably explicit language in section\n\n241(a)(5) reinforces our intuition that we should not read that\n\nsection   as   evincing   congressional    intent    to   mandate   summary\n\nprocedures for reinstating prior deportation orders.\n\n           The legislative history marshaled by the government does\n\nnot save the day.   Although that history tends to cast doubt on the\n\npetitioner's assessment of the statutory scheme, see text supra, it\n\nis in the end inconclusive.       Much like the statute itself, the\n\nlegislative    history    indicates   a   general   intent   that   illegal\n\nreentrants be removed expeditiously, but it does not address\n\nprocedural questions with either clarity or specificity.                The\n\ncommittee report quoted extensively by the government illustrates\n\nthis point:    although stating that \"[e]xisting procedures to deny\n\nentry to and remove illegal aliens from the United States are\n\ncumbersome and duplicative,\" H.R. Rep. 104-469, supra, at 134, it\n\nneither explicates nor endorses any particular procedures for\n\nreinstating removal orders.      Given this indeterminacy, we decline\n\nto read a procedural mandate into section 241(a)(5).\n\n           The bottom line is that we find the INA ambiguous with\n\nregard to the procedures to be used when the government, in the\n\npost-IIRIRA era, seeks to reinstate a prior removal order against\n\nan illegal reentrant.      Because the statutory scheme lacks clarity\n\nin this respect, we answer the first Chevron question in the\n\n\n                                  -20-\n\fnegative and proceed to the second Chevron question.               At that\n\nstage, we assay the government's implementation of the statute, as\n\nexpressed in its rulemaking, mindful that we must defer to that\n\nrulemaking as long as we find it reasonable.          Aguirre-Aguirre, 526\n\nU.S. at 424; Chevron, 467 U.S. at 843.        We have little difficulty\n\nin concluding that the government's interpretation satisfies this\n\ncondition.\n\n           As said, the legislative history shows that Congress, in\n\nenacting IIRIRA, sought to make the removal of illegal reentrants\n\nmore   expeditious.   Providing    a     mechanical    procedure   for   the\n\nreinstatement of prior orders is entirely consistent with this\n\npurpose.     Moreover, we agree with the Eighth Circuit that the\n\nelimination of any exogenous defense to reinstatement significantly\n\nnarrows the range of issues to be adjudicated, thereby limiting the\n\nvalue of additional procedures.    See Alvarez-Portillo, 280 F.3d at\n\n868 (\"The streamlined notice and opportunity to be heard afforded\n\nillegal reentrants under 8 C.F.R. § 241.8 seem quite appropriate\n\nwhen the only issues to be determined are those establishing the\n\nagency's right to proceed under § 241(a)(5) — the alien's identity,\n\nthe existence of a prior removal order, and whether the alien has\n\nunlawfully reentered.\"). For these reasons, we conclude that it is\n\nreasonable to interpret the INA, as amended by IIRIRA, as giving\n\n\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fthe government authority to craft a streamlined procedure for the\n\nreinstatement of earlier deportation orders.4\n\n                         C.   Due Process.\n\n          The petitioner next essays a constitutional challenge.\n\nHe posits that even if the summary reinstatement procedure is not\n\nultra vires, it nonetheless fails to pass muster under the Due\n\nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment.5\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      We need not address the reasonableness of the particular\nsummary reinstatement procedure adopted by the government. While\nthe petitioner has challenged the constitutionality of those\nprocedures, see infra Part III(C), he has not challenged their\nreasonableness. In all events, there was no conceivable error in\nthe reinstatement of the petitioner's original deportation order.\nConsequently, we leave an assessment of the reasonableness of the\nspecific procedures adopted by the government for another day.\n     5\n      If a constitutional challenge of this sort were to hold\nwater, that doubtless would affect our judgment on the second step\nof the Chevron pavane.    An interpretation of a statute that is\nunconstitutional, is by definition unreasonable. U.S. West, Inc.\nv. FCC, 182 F.3d 1224, 1231 (10th Cir. 1999).\n     One member of the panel questions whether the statute (section\n241(a)(5)) should be construed under the first step of Chevron to\navoid a lurking constitutional issue. See, e.g., St. Cyr, 533 U.S.\nat 299-300 (\"[I]f an otherwise acceptable construction of a statute\nwould raise serious constitutional problems, and where an\nalternative interpretation of the statute is 'fairly possible,' we\nare obligated to construe the statute to avoid such problems.\"\n(quoting Crowell v. Benson, 285 U.S. 22, 62 (1932)) (citation\nomitted)); Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. v. Fla. Gulf Coast Bldg. &\nConstr. Trades Council, 485 U.S. 568, 574-75 (1988) (construing a\nstatute to avoid serious constitutional problems in step one of the\nChevron analysis). Since this issue has not been fully developed\nby the parties and since, in all events, we do not reach the\nconstitutional question, see text supra, we have no occasion to\nreach this question. Thus, we leave open the possibility that the\nrule of avoidance might lead to a different statutory construction.\n\n                               -22-\n\f          We decline to address the merits of this argument. It is\n\nbeyond peradventure that before a petitioner in an immigration case\n\nmay advance a procedural due process claim, he must allege some\n\ncognizable prejudice fairly attributable to the challenged process.\n\nSee, e.g., Ojeda-Terrazas, 290 F.3d at 302; Bernal-Vallejo v. INS,\n\n195 F.3d 56, 64 (1st Cir. 1999).        That prerequisite is absent here.\n\n          The petitioner does not dispute that when he left the\n\nUnited   States    in   1996,   his     departure   constituted   a   self-\n\ndeportation.      Nor does he contest that he reentered the country\n\nillegally in 1997.      Thus, the petitioner effectively has admitted\n\nall the facts necessary to warrant reinstatement of the original\n\ndeportation order.       It follows inexorably that he cannot show\n\nprejudice attributable to the government's use of a summary process\n\nin his case.      Ojeda-Terrazas, 290 F.3d at 302.       Consequently, we\n\nare without authority to reach his due process initiative.6\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      Although this case does not provide a vehicle for testing the\nmerits of the constitutional claim, we do not mean to imply that\nthe claim is insubstantial.     The summary reinstatement process\noffers virtually no procedural protections. The regulation grants\naliens to whom it applies nothing more than a chance to make a\nstatement opposing reinstatement to an immigration officer (not to\na judge). It guarantees the alien no notice before reinstatement\nof a prior deportation order, affords him no real opportunity to\ncontest the facts underlying the reinstatement, and contemplates no\npresentation of evidence. See generally 8 C.F.R. § 241.8. While\njudicial review of reinstatement orders is available in the courts\nof appeals, see 8 U.S.C. § 1252, that review may not be adequate\nwhen the alien has not been given a meaningful opportunity to\ndevelop an administrative record.\n\n                                      -23-\n\f                         D.   Section 245(i).\n\n          Finally, the petitioner suggests that even if section\n\n241(a)(5) is generally enforceable, he remains eligible to seek\n\nadjustment of status under INA § 245(i), 8 U.S.C. § 1255(i).\n\nBecause   this   suggestion       rests    on    a    matter   of   statutory\n\nconstruction, we undertake de novo review.             Strickland v. Comm'r,\n\nMe. Dep't of Human Servs., 96 F.3d 542, 545 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n          INA § 245(i) allows certain classes of illegal aliens,\n\nincluding those who are spouses of United States citizens, to\n\npetition for adjustment of status.         The petitioner posits that the\n\navailability of relief under section 245(i), especially in light of\n\nCongress's reenactment of that provision in 2000, conflicts with\n\nsection 241(a)(5)'s bar on relief.         He then invites us to resolve\n\nthis perceived conflict by holding that section 245(i) effectively\n\ntrumps section 241(a)(5), thus permitting an alien subject to the\n\nlatter provision to apply for adjustment of status under the former\n\nprovision.\n\n          The    short   answer    to     this   invitation    is   that   the\n\npetitioner has erected a straw man:                  there is no meaningful\n\nconflict between sections 241(a)(5) and 245(i).            Section 241(a)(5)\n\nonly bars aliens who have illegally reentered the United States\n\nafter having previously been deported from applying for relief.\n\nMany aliens illegally present in the United States (perhaps most\n\nsuch aliens) have never before been deported, and nothing in\n\n\n                                    -24-\n\fsection 241(a)(5) prevents them from seeking adjustments of status\n\nunder section       245(i).     The    mere    fact   that    section    241(a)(5)\n\nprecludes a subset of aliens from taking advantage of section\n\n245(i) does not create a conflict.             Cf. Hughes v. Att'y Gen., 377\n\nF.3d   1258,   1268   (11th     Cir.   2004)    (finding      no    conflict,   for\n\npreemption purposes, when a federal statute only applied to a\n\nsubset of activity regulated by the state statute, and the conduct\n\nin question fell outside that subset).                We hold, therefore, that\n\nsection    245(i)     creates    no    impediment       to    the     government's\n\napplication of section 241(a)(5) in this case.                     Accord Alvarez-\n\nPortillo, 280 F.3d at 862.\n\nIV.    CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further.        IIRIRA has tightened the screws\n\non deportation proceedings in a variety of ways, and persons of\n\ngood will can disagree as to the policy judgments that those\n\nstringencies    reflect.        Such   judgments       are,   however,    for   the\n\nCongress, not for the courts.          See, e.g., Plumley v. S. Container,\n\nInc., 303 F.3d 364, 375 (1st Cir. 2002).                Our task is simply to\n\ninterpret Congress's handiwork and measure the end product against\n\nappropriate legal and constitutional benchmarks.               Having performed\n\nthat task, we are constrained to reject the instant petition.\n\n\n\n            The petition for review is denied and dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\f",

His case presents a gallimaufry of issues, including yet another in the series of retroactivity problems that have trailed Congress's enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-598 (IIRIRA). Broadly stated, Lattab &#8212; with the able assistance of the amicus &#8212; attacks an IIRIRA provision, codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(a)(5), which mandates the reinstatement of a prior deportation order (or removal order &#8212; the terms are interchangeable on these facts) when an alien subject to such an order is found to have reentered the country illegally. He argues that the reinstatement provision is impermissibly retroactive as applied to his case; that the regulatory procedure implementing it is ultra vires; and that, in all events, the provision deprives illegally reentering aliens of procedural due process. As a fallback, he asserts that the reinstatement provision ought not to have been invoked in this instance because another statute trumped its operation. Concluding, as we do, that this asseverational array lacks force, we deny and dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. THE NEW REINSTATEMENT PROVISION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by limning the parameters of the new reinstatement provision. Among many other innovations, IIRIRA repealed the former reinstatement provision, section 242(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(f) (repealed 1996), and enacted a new reinstatement provision at section 241(a)(5), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(a)(5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Section 241(a)(5) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Attorney General finds that an alien has reentered the United States illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily, under an order of removal, the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed, the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under [the INA], and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This provision took effect on April 1, 1997. It altered preexisting law in at least three salient respects. First, under the old regime only illegal reentrants who had previously been deported on certain specified grounds (e.g., conviction for an aggravated felony) were subject to having their original deportation orders reinstated. Under section 241(a)(5), however, all illegal reentrants now face the prospect of such reinstatement. <i>See Arevalo v. Ashcroft,</i> 344 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2003). Second, under the earlier system an alien had a right to a hearing, presided over by an immigration judge, before reinstatement of the prior deportation order became a fait accompli. Under the regulations implementing section 241(a)(5), however, there is no longer a right to such a hearing (or to any hearing, for that matter). <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 241.8. Third, preexisting law allowed an illegal reentrant to attempt to fend off execution of a reinstated deportation order by petitioning for discretionary relief in the form of an adjustment of his status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Conversely, section 241(a)(5) pretermits an illegal reentrant's ability to apply for any relief under the INA. <i>See Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next recount the facts undergirding the case. The petitioner first entered the United States on February 7, 1992, as a tourist. He overstayed his visa and remained here for some time. On March 29, 1996, an immigration judge found him deportable but allowed him to depart voluntarily on or before June 27 of that year. The petitioner failed to comply &#8212; he did not leave the United States until August 23, 1996 &#8212; and that default caused the immigration judge's ukase to mutate into a deportation order. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 243.5 (repealed 1997). In the eyes of the law, therefore, the petitioner's belated departure was tantamount to self-deportation. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While in the United States, the petitioner had become romantically involved with a United States citizen (he claims that they had become engaged). He reentered the United States illegally on March 1, 1997, and resumed this courtship. He and his fiancee were married on July 5, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 23, 2000, the petitioner's wife filed an \"immediate relative\" petition with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This petition was approved on August 28, 2002. That approval, standing alone, did not affect the petitioner's immigration status, but, rather, paved the way for a possible adjustment. <i>See</i> INA &#167; 245(i), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i). To that end, he immediately sought to have his status changed to that of lawful permanent resident. During the pendency of that application, the INS approved the petitioner's request for temporary authorization to engage in employment. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 274a.12(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 5, 2003, the petitioner endeavored to renew his employment authorization. While at the CIS office in Boston, an immigration officer discovered that the petitioner had been deported once before. He was taken into custody and soon thereafter ICE, relying on section 241(a)(5), reinstated the 1996 deportation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dismayed by this chain of events, the petitioner sought judicial review. His petition contends, inter alia, that the government's attempt to apply section 241(a)(5) to his case has an impermissibly retroactive effect; that the summary reinstatement of the prior deportation order disregarded both statutorily mandated procedures and the dictates of the Due Process Clause; and that in the circumstances of this case, section 241(a)(5) must yield to a different (allegedly conflicting) INA provision. Because an order reinstating a prior removal order is \"the functional equivalent of a final order of removal,\" <i>Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 9, we have jurisdiction to hear and determine these contentions under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner and the amicus advance four principal arguments. We consider them in an order that roughly corresponds to the amount of energy that they have devoted to each.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Retroactivity.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The centerpiece of the petitioner's case is a claim that application of section 241(a)(5) to his circumstances is impermissibly retroactive. Since IIRIRA took effect <i>after</i> his illegal reentry in 1997, this thesis runs, retroactive application of the new reinstatement proviso would violate his settled expectation that he would be allowed to seek an adjustment of his immigration status following his marriage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether application of a statute to a given situation is impermissibly retroactive presents a quintessentially legal question. Judicial review is de novo and, accordingly, the agency's views garner no special deference. <i>Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 9-10 (explaining that \"courts, rather than agencies, are best equipped to make the constitutionally tinged judgment calls inherent in retroactivity determinations\"). We proceed on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no doubt that Congress has the raw power to enact statutes that operate retroactively. <i>See Landgraf v. USI Film Prods.,</i> 511 U.S. 244, 267, 114 S.Ct. 1483, 128 L.Ed.2d 229 (1994). But because retroactive legislation has the potential to alter the consequences of actions already taken, courts start with a presumption that Congress intends to legislate prospectively. <i>Id.</i> at 272-73, 114 S.Ct. 1483. Congress can overcome this presumption and give legislation a retroactive effect only by clearly indicating its intent to do so. <i>Id.</i> at 268, 114 S.Ct. 1483.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We analyze the possibility that Congress intended a statute to apply retroactively under the rubric set forth in <i>Landgraf.</i> Initially, we decide whether Congress has clearly stated an intention to have the statute apply retrospectively. <i>Id.</i> at 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483; <i>Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 10. Although this prong of the test requires Congress's intention to be unmistakable, our inquiry is not limited to the statutory text but may include an examination of standard ensigns of statutory construction, such as the statute's structure and legislative history. <i>See Martin v. Hadix,</i> 527 U.S. 343, 355-57, 119 S.Ct. 1998, 144 L.Ed.2d 347 (1999); <i>see also Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 11-13 (examining these factors in determining the sweep of section 241(a)(5), but noting that \"the benchmark for finding unambiguous temporal scope is quite high\"). If this perscrutation leads to a firm conviction that Congress intended the statute to have a specific temporal reach, the retroactivity analysis ends and we will apply the statute in accordance with Congress's prescription. In the absence of such a directive, we will proceed to determine whether the application in question would have an impermissibly retroactive effect. <i>Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483; <i>Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 10-11. That result obtains if the specified application would \"impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.\" <i>Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483. In that event, the presumption that Congress did not intend the statute to apply retrospectively will hold. <i>Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 11. Otherwise, retroactive application is permissible. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the search for express congressional intent need not occupy us for long. Three years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress did not specify the temporal reach of section 304 of IIRIRA. <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> 533 U.S. 289, 320, 121 S.Ct. 2271, 150 L.Ed.2d 347 (2001). Building on that foundation, we concluded last year that section 241(a)(5) shared this characteristic. <i>Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 13. In forming that conclusion, we carefully examined both the text and legislative history of IIRIRA in general and section 241(a)(5) in particular. <i>Id.</i> at 11-13. This exercise left us with the conviction that \"section 241(a)(5) is hopelessly unclear as to whether it applies to those who illegally reentered the United States before April 1, 1997.\" <i>Id.</i> at 13. This panel is bound by that determination. <i>United States v. Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second step of the <i>Landgraf</i> pavane requires us to determine whether application of section 241(a)(5) to the petitioner's circumstances would have an impermissibly retroactive effect. The logical starting point for this inquiry is the ascertainment of what rights and justifiable expectations the petitioner may have had under the law as it existed immediately before IIRIRA's effective date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law did not change between the date when the petitioner illegally reentered the country (March 1, 1997) and IIRIRA's effective date (April 1, 1997). Under that regime, the petitioner was immediately deportable. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227 (1994) (specifying grounds for deportation). There is no indication in the record that the petitioner ever sought, or qualified for, asylum. From aught that appears, in the spring of 1997 he would not have had any defense to deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, at that time the petitioner would not have been subject to summary reinstatement of the prior deportation order. Instead, deportability would have been determined in a new proceeding before an immigration judge. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 242.23 (repealed 1999). Pre-IIRIRA law would have allowed the petitioner, coincident with the commencement of that new proceeding, to apply for adjustment of his immigration status based upon his marriage, notwithstanding the fact that he had reentered the country illegally. INA &#167; 245, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that template, IIRIRA worked relatively few changes in the petitioner's situation. Substantively, he was still illegally in the country and still subject to deportation after the new law took effect. While section 241(a)(5) barred him from applying for any affirmative relief (such as an adjustment of status) from and after April 1, 1997, that change was inconsequential because there was no relief for which petitioner could then have qualified. After all, his wedding did not occur until July 5, 1999 (over two years after IIRIRA took effect).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the only consequence that IIRIRA added to the petitioner's illegal reentry was procedural: he was subject to having his prior deportation order peremptorily reinstated and was no longer entitled to a hearing before that reinstatement. That consequence is insufficient to derail the application of the new statute. As a general rule, the application of new procedural mechanisms to the adjudication of past conduct is not impermissibly retroactive. <i>Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 275, 114 S.Ct. 1483. More to the point, we previously have held that this precise procedural change falls within that general rule, not within the long-odds exception to it. <i>See Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 13 (holding that \"although aliens subject to reinstatement of a previous deportation order had a right to ... a hearing before the passage of the IIRIRA,... that right was procedural and, therefore, can be taken away retroactively\"). Other courts agree. <i>See, e.g., Ojeda-Terrazas v. Ashcroft,</i> 290 F.3d 292, 301-02 (5th Cir.2002); <i>Alvarez-Portillo v. Ashcroft,</i> 280 F.3d 858, 865 (8th Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner nonetheless maintains that section 241(a)(5) ought not be applied to bar his application for adjustment of status because at the time section 241(a)(5) took effect, he planned to marry a United States citizen and thus become eligible for lawful permanent resident status. He points to the government's longstanding practice of allowing an alien illegally present in the United States to seek adjustment of status following marriage to a citizen and asserts that he was entitled to rely on this praxis. This assertion comprises more cry than wool.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A statute only has an impermissibly retroactive effect when it would change the legal consequences of actions actually taken (or refrained from) prior to the statute's effective date. <i>See Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 280, 114 S.Ct. 1483. Inchoate plans to act in the future, even when made in anticipation of the legal consequences of those future actions, do not convey the type of settled expectation that retroactivity analysis seeks to protect. <i>See id.</i> at 269, 114 S.Ct. 1483 (noting that retroactive application of a statute is not impermissible merely because that application \"upsets expectations based in prior law\"). Because the petitioner did not marry (and thus, did not qualify for adjustment of status) until more than two years after IIRIRA's effective date, he cannot validly complain about the elimination of his ability to apply for a future adjustment of status. The decisive datum is that the petitioner had no sufficiently settled expectation that he could adjust his status <i>at the time section 241(a)(5) took effect,</i> because he was not yet married. Thus, applying that provision to the petitioner is not impermissibly retroactive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two loose ends. First, the petitioner asserts that because he applied for adjustment of status before the government actually reinstated the prior order of deportation, section 241(a)(5)'s bar to relief ought not to apply. We deem this argument squarely foreclosed by the text of the statute. Section 241(a)(5) subjects an illegal reentrant to three independent consequences: reinstatement of the prior deportation order, ineligibility for any relief, and removal. Grammatically, section 241(a)(5) does not make ineligibility for relief dependent upon reinstatement of the prior deportation order. And even if it did, section 241(a)(5) expressly makes reinstatement retroactive to the date of the original deportation order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second loose end is a bit different. In a post-argument letter, <i>see</i> Fed. R.App. P. 28(j); 1st Cir. R. 28(j), the petitioner attempted to embrace the recent decision in <i>Perez-Gonzalez v. Ashcroft,</i> 379 F.3d 783 (9th Cir.2004). That case involved the effect of a pending application for permission to reenter the country, filed after the petitioner illegally reentered, on the relief bar erected by section 241(a)(5). The Ninth Circuit stated that if the application were approved, that approval would cure the illegal reentry and section 241(a)(5) would not apply. <i>Id.</i> at 795. The petitioner now seeks to avail himself of this possible escape hatch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, unlike in <i>Perez-Gonzalez,</i> the petitioner did not argue that approval of an application for permission to reenter would cure his illegal reentry; nor did he argue, by analogy, that the government's approval of his wife's \"immediate relative\" petition should be accorded a similar effect. It is readily apparent, then, that <i>Perez-Gonzalez</i> turns on a legal theory never explored either in the petitioner's briefs to this court or at oral argument. The usual rule, applicable here, is that new theories cannot be raised in a post-argument Rule 28(j) filing. <i>United States v. Nason,</i> 9 F.3d 155, 163 (1st Cir.1993). It is arguable that this theory has been waived; at best, it has been forfeited. <i>See Bennett v. City of Holyoke,</i> 362 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, a forfeited argument occasionally can be resurrected under the plain error doctrine. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). But that doctrine contains fairly rigorous criteria. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> It requires, at a bare minimum, that the complaining party point to a \"clear or obvious\" error. <i>Id.</i> Here, however, we have grave doubts about the correctness of the <i>Perez-Gonzalez</i> court's conclusion. It seems to us that permission to reenter, like adjustment of status, is relief under the INA, which section 241(a)(5) precludes an illegal reentrant from seeking. Furthermore, we find it difficult to accept the Ninth Circuit's heavy reliance on regulations that antedate IIRIRA in interpreting the reach of section 241(a)(5). We are, therefore, unable to find a clear or obvious error in ICE's decisionmaking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although that ends this phase of our analysis, we add a coda. We hold today only that application of section 241(a)(5) to deprive an alien who illegally reentered the country before IIRIRA's effective date of the ability to apply for relief for which the alien did not theretofore qualify is not impermissibly retroactive. We do not purport to decide the retroactive application of section 241(a)(5) to all aliens who reentered illegally before April 1, 1997, nor do we address the case of an alien illegally present in the United States who had a potential defense to deportation before IIRIRA took effect but had not yet applied for relief when IIRIRA eliminated that defense. We leave these questions for future cases, pausing only to remind the reader that application of retroactivity principles requires \"commonsense, functional judgment[s],\" <i>Hadix,</i> 527 U.S. at 357, 119 S.Ct. 1998, and that each case should be assessed on its own facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Ultra Vires.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the application of section 241(a)(5) to the petitioner's circumstances does not have an impermissibly retroactive effect, we next consider the petitioner's claim that 8 C.F.R. &#167; 241.8, which implements section 241(a)(5), is at variance with the procedures stipulated in INA &#167; 240, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a. This question engenders review under a familiar two-part paradigm. <i>See generally INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. 415, 424, 119 S.Ct. 1439, 143 L.Ed.2d 590 (1999); <i>Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc.,</i> 467 U.S. 837, 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778, 81 L.Ed.2d 694 (1984). Under that paradigm, we first determine whether Congress has spoken clearly on the precise question. <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 842-43, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If it has, we will enforce Congress's instructions. <i>Id.</i> at 842, 104 S.Ct. 2778. If it has not, we will defer to the administering agency's construction of the statute so long as that construction is reasonable. <i>Id.</i> at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The challenged regulation provides for reinstatement of a prior deportation order without first affording an alien a hearing before an immigration judge. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 241.8. The petitioner contrasts this spartan regime with INA &#167; 240, which sets forth the procedures to be followed when determining removability in the first instance. In general, section 240 entitles aliens to be represented by counsel, to be heard by an immigration judge, to adduce evidence, and to cross-examine adverse witnesses. That section further provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, a proceeding under this section shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining whether an alien may be ... removed from the United States....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(a)(3). The petitioner says that summary reinstatement of a deportation order sets up a parallel procedure for removal and thus conflicts with the quoted statute. In the petitioner's view, this renders the regulation ultra vires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government retorts that summary reinstatement of a deportation order is not beyond the Attorney General's statutory authority because INA &#167; 241(a)(5) provides an explicit, congressionally sanctioned alternative to the otherwise exclusive procedure delineated in section 240. The government seeds its argument with persistent references to the legislative history. Those references indicate (or so the government says) that Congress intended aliens who reentered the country illegally after once having been deported to be treated as a separate class and removed expeditiously. <i>See, e.g.,</i> H.R.Rep. No. 104-469, pt. 1, at 13 (1996) (explaining that \"if aliens who are ordered removed ... seek reentry they are subject to immediate removal under the prior order\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's argument has a veneer of plausibility. After all, the decision to reinstate a prior deportation order is to some extent a determination as to whether an alien may be removed from the United States. <i>Cf. Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 9 (holding, albeit in the context of appellate jurisdiction, that \"reinstatement itself operates as the functional equivalent of a final order of removal\"). This carapace, however, is easily pierced. Considering section 240 in the context of the INA as a whole, we conclude that its application to the reinstatement of earlier deportation orders is at best uncertain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For one thing, section 240 is primarily concerned with proceedings to determine whether aliens are excludable or deportable on one of the bases enumerated in INA &#167;&#167; 212 and 237, 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1182 and 1227. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(a)(2) (\"An alien placed in proceedings under this section may be charged with any applicable ground of inadmissibility under [section 212] or any ground of deportability under [section 237].\"). In contrast, section 241 deals specifically with aliens who already have been ordered removed, and the placement of the reinstatement provision in a separate section logically can be understood as indicating a congressional intention to treat reinstatement determinations differently from first-instance determinations of removability. <i>Cf. Alexander v. Sandoval,</i> 532 U.S. 275, 288-91, 121 S.Ct. 1511, 149 L.Ed.2d 517 (2001) (relying in part on the separation of substantive standards and regulatory authority into different sections of a single statute to find that Congress intended to create a private right of action to enforce the former, but not the latter).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For another thing, when Congress enacted IIRIRA, it plainly was dissatisfied with the performance of the former reinstatement provision, which had \"fallen into desuetude.\" <i>Castro-Cortez v. INS,</i> 239 F.3d 1037, 1040 n. 1 (9th Cir.2001). Congress apparently believed that the reinstatement regime should be altered dramatically, <i>Alvarez-Portillo,</i> 280 F.3d at 863, and reformed to function swiftly and simply. <i>See, e.g.,</i> S. Rep. 104-249, at 7 (1995) (\"Aliens who violate U.S. Immigration law should be removed from this country as soon as possible.\"); H.R.Rep. No. 104-469, <i>supra,</i> at 134 (calling pre-IIRIRA procedures \"cumbersome and duplicative,\" and positing that IIRIRA would correct these flaws). We think it unarguable that Congress intended IIRIRA to strengthen the reinstatement provision and to make it operate more efficiently. Viewed against this backdrop, it seems reasonable that, rather than spelling out procedural changes by statute, Congress may have expected the Attorney General to reevaluate the implementation of the reinstatement statute and to set in place a regulatory regimen that would further these goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, we find the government's statutory interpretation no more compelling. The text of section 241(a)(5) simply will not bear the weight that the Attorney General tries to pile upon it. To say, as does section 241(a)(5), that an alien \"shall be removed under the prior order at any time after... reentry\" says nothing about how the government may go about determining either the existence of a prior order or the fact of an illegal reentry. <i>See Castro-Cortez,</i> 239 F.3d at 1048. Nor does section 241(a)(5)'s bar on seeking relief from reinstatement of an earlier order necessarily indicate an intention that the prior order be reinstated peremptorily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INA, taken as a whole, highlights this lack of certitude. When compared with other provisions explicitly authorizing alternative procedures, section 241(a)(5) looks even less like an explicit authorization. For example, section 235 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225, provides for summary removal proceedings for certain aliens upon their arrival in the United States. To take one case, that section provides that aliens who arrive without proper documentation shall be removed \"without further hearing or review.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1225(b)(1)(i). In a similar vein, stowaways are expressly ineligible for \"a hearing under [section 240].\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1225(a)(2). The absence of comparably explicit language in section 241(a)(5) reinforces our intuition that we should not read that section as evincing congressional intent to mandate summary procedures for reinstating prior deportation orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history marshaled by the government does not save the day. Although that history tends to cast doubt on the petitioner's assessment of the statutory scheme, <i>see</i> text <i>supra,</i> it is in the end inconclusive. Much like the statute itself, the legislative history indicates a general intent that illegal reentrants be removed expeditiously, but it does not address procedural questions with either clarity or specificity. The committee report quoted extensively by the government illustrates this point: although stating that \"[e]xisting procedures to deny entry to and remove illegal aliens from the United States are cumbersome and duplicative,\" H.R. Rep. 104-469, <i>supra,</i> at 134, it neither explicates nor endorses any particular procedures for reinstating removal orders. Given this indeterminacy, we decline to read a procedural mandate into section 241(a)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bottom line is that we find the INA ambiguous with regard to the procedures to be used when the government, in the post-IIRIRA era, seeks to reinstate a prior removal order against an illegal reentrant. Because the statutory scheme lacks clarity in this respect, we answer the first <i>Chevron</i> question in the negative and proceed to the second <i>Chevron</i> question. At that stage, we assay the government's implementation of the statute, as expressed in its rulemaking, mindful that we must defer to that rulemaking as long as we find it reasonable. <i>Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. at 424, 119 S.Ct. 1439; <i>Chevron,</i> 467 U.S. at 843, 104 S.Ct. 2778. We have little difficulty in concluding that the government's interpretation satisfies this condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, the legislative history shows that Congress, in enacting IIRIRA, sought to make the removal of illegal reentrants more expeditious. Providing a mechanical procedure for the reinstatement of prior orders is entirely consistent with this purpose. Moreover, we agree with the Eighth Circuit that the elimination of any exogenous defense to reinstatement significantly narrows the range of issues to be adjudicated, thereby limiting the value of additional procedures. <i>See Alvarez-Portillo,</i> 280 F.3d at 868 (\"The streamlined notice and opportunity to be heard afforded illegal reentrants under 8 C.F.R. &#167; 241.8 seem quite appropriate when the only issues to be determined are those establishing the agency's right to proceed under &#167; 241(a)(5) &#8212; the alien's identity, the existence of a prior removal order, and whether the alien has unlawfully reentered.\"). For these reasons, we conclude that it is reasonable to interpret the INA, as amended by IIRIRA, as giving the government authority to craft a streamlined procedure for the reinstatement of earlier deportation orders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Due Process.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner next essays a constitutional challenge. He posits that even if the summary reinstatement procedure is not ultra vires, it nonetheless fails to pass muster under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline to address the merits of this argument. It is beyond peradventure that before a petitioner in an immigration case may advance a procedural due process claim, he must allege some cognizable prejudice fairly attributable to the challenged process. <i>See, e.g., Ojeda-Terrazas,</i> 290 F.3d at 302; <i>Bernal-Vallejo v.</i> <i>INS,</i> 195 F.3d 56, 64 (1st Cir.1999). That prerequisite is absent here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner does not dispute that when he left the United States in 1996, his departure constituted a self-deportation. Nor does he contest that he reentered the country illegally in 1997. Thus, the petitioner effectively has admitted all the facts necessary to warrant reinstatement of the original deportation order. It follows inexorably that he cannot show prejudice attributable to the government's use of a summary process in his case. <i>Ojeda-Terrazas,</i> 290 F.3d at 302. Consequently, we are without authority to reach his due process initiative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>Section 245(i).</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the petitioner suggests that even if section 241(a)(5) is generally enforceable, he remains eligible to seek adjustment of status under INA &#167; 245(i), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i). Because this suggestion rests on a matter of statutory construction, we undertake de novo review. <i>Strickland v. Comm'r, Me. Dep't of Human Servs.,</i> 96 F.3d 542, 545 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">INA &#167; 245(i) allows certain classes of illegal aliens, including those who are spouses of United States citizens, to petition for adjustment of status. The petitioner posits that the availability of relief under section 245(i), especially in light of Congress's reenactment of that provision in 2000, conflicts with section 241(a)(5)'s bar on relief. He then invites us to resolve this perceived conflict by holding that section 245(i) effectively trumps section 241(a)(5), thus permitting an alien subject to the latter provision to apply for adjustment of status under the former provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short answer to this invitation is that the petitioner has erected a straw man: there is no meaningful conflict between sections 241(a)(5) and 245(i). Section 241(a)(5) only bars aliens who have illegally reentered the United States after having previously been deported from applying for relief. Many aliens illegally present in the United States (perhaps most such aliens) have never before been deported, and nothing in section 241(a)(5) prevents them from seeking adjustments of status under section 245(i). The mere fact that section 241(a)(5) precludes a subset of aliens from taking advantage of section 245(i) does not create a conflict. <i>Cf. Hughes v. Att'y Gen.,</i> 377 F.3d 1258, 1268 (11th Cir.2004) (finding no conflict, for preemption purposes, when a federal statute only applied to a subset of activity regulated by the state statute, and the conduct in question fell outside that subset). We hold, therefore, that section 245(i) creates no impediment to the government's application of section 241(a)(5) in this case. <i>Accord Alvarez-Portillo,</i> 280 F.3d at 862.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. IIRIRA has tightened the screws on deportation proceedings in a variety of ways, and persons of good will can disagree as to the policy judgments that those stringencies reflect. Such judgments are, however, for the Congress, not for the courts. <i>See, e.g., Plumley v. S. Container, Inc.,</i> 303 F.3d 364, 375 (1st Cir.2002). Our task is simply to interpret Congress's handiwork and measure the end product against appropriate legal and constitutional benchmarks.

The INS functions related to the processing of applications for adjustment of status now reside in the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service (CIS).

Consequently, we leave an assessment of the reasonableness of the specific procedures adopted by the government for another day.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> If a constitutional challenge of this sort were to hold water, that doubtless would affect our judgment on the second step of the<i>Chevron</i> pavane.

Since this issue has not been fully developed by the parties and since, in all events, we do not reach the constitutional question, <i>see</i> text <i>supra,</i> we have no occasion to reach this question. Thus, we leave open the possibility that the rule of avoidance might lead to a different statutory construction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Although this case does not provide a vehicle for testing the merits of the constitutional claim, we do not mean to imply that the claim is insubstantial. The summary reinstatement process offers virtually no procedural protections. The regulation grants aliens to whom it applies nothing more than a chance to make a statement opposing reinstatement to an immigration officer (not to a judge). It guarantees the alien no notice before reinstatement of a prior deportation order, affords him no real opportunity to contest the facts underlying the reinstatement, and contemplates no presentation of evidence<i>See generally</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 241.8. While judicial review of reinstatement orders is available in the courts of appeals, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252, that review may not be adequate when the alien has not been given a meaningful opportunity to develop an administrative record.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

His case presents a gallimaufry of issues, including yet another in the series of retroactivity problems that have trailed Congress's enactment of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, Pub.L. 104-208, 110 Stat. 3009-598 (IIRIRA). Broadly stated, Lattab &#8212; with the able assistance of the amicus &#8212; attacks an IIRIRA provision, codified at 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(a)(5), which mandates the reinstatement of a prior deportation order (or removal order &#8212; the terms are interchangeable on these facts) when an alien subject to such an order is found to have reentered the country illegally. He argues that the reinstatement provision is impermissibly retroactive as applied to his case; that the regulatory procedure implementing it is ultra vires; and that, in all events, the provision deprives illegally reentering aliens of procedural due process. As a fallback, he asserts that the reinstatement provision ought not to have been invoked in this instance because another statute trumped its operation. Concluding, as we do, that this asseverational array lacks force, we deny and dismiss the petition for review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. THE NEW REINSTATEMENT PROVISION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin by limning the parameters of the new reinstatement provision. Among many other innovations, IIRIRA repealed the former reinstatement provision, section 242(f) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(f) (repealed 1996), and enacted a new reinstatement provision at section 241(a)(5), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1231(a)(5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Section 241(a)(5) provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the Attorney General finds that an alien has reentered the United States illegally after having been removed or having departed voluntarily, under an order of removal, the prior order of removal is reinstated from its original date and is not subject to being reopened or reviewed, the alien is not eligible and may not apply for any relief under [the INA], and the alien shall be removed under the prior order at any time after the reentry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This provision took effect on April 1, 1997. It altered preexisting law in at least three salient respects. First, under the old regime only illegal reentrants who had previously been deported on certain specified grounds (e.g., conviction for an aggravated felony) were subject to having their original deportation orders reinstated. Under section 241(a)(5), however, all illegal reentrants now face the prospect of such reinstatement. <i>See Arevalo v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200622\"><a href=\"/opinion/200622/arevalo-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 (1st Cir.2003). Second, under the earlier system an alien had a right to a hearing, presided over by an immigration judge, before reinstatement of the prior deportation order became a fait accompli. Under the regulations implementing section 241(a)(5), however, there is no longer a right to such a hearing (or to any hearing, for that matter). <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 241.8. Third, preexisting law allowed an illegal reentrant to attempt to fend off execution of a reinstated deportation order by petitioning for discretionary relief in the form of an adjustment of his status to that of an alien lawfully admitted for permanent residence. Conversely, section 241(a)(5) pretermits an illegal reentrant's ability to apply for any relief under the INA. <i>See Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 5.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We next recount the facts undergirding the case. The petitioner first entered the United States on February 7, 1992, as a tourist. He overstayed his visa and remained here for some time. On March 29, 1996, an immigration judge found him deportable but allowed him to depart voluntarily on or before June 27 of that year. The petitioner failed to comply &#8212; he did not leave the United States until August 23, 1996 &#8212; and that default caused the immigration judge's ukase to mutate into a deportation order. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 243.5 (repealed 1997). In the eyes of the law, therefore, the petitioner's belated departure was tantamount to self-deportation. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While in the United States, the petitioner had become romantically involved with a United States citizen (he claims that they had become engaged). He reentered the United States illegally on March 1, 1997, and resumed this courtship. He and his fiancee were married on July 5, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 23, 2000, the petitioner's wife filed an \"immediate relative\" petition with the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> This petition was approved on August 28, 2002. That approval, standing alone, did not affect the petitioner's immigration status, but, rather, paved the way for a possible adjustment. <i>See</i> INA &#167; 245(i), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i). To that end, he immediately sought to have his status changed to that of lawful permanent resident. During the pendency of that application, the INS approved the petitioner's request for temporary authorization to engage in employment. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 274a.12(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 5, 2003, the petitioner endeavored to renew his employment authorization. While at the CIS office in Boston, an immigration officer discovered that the petitioner had been deported once before. He was taken into custody and soon thereafter ICE, relying on section 241(a)(5), reinstated the 1996 deportation order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dismayed by this chain of events, the petitioner sought judicial review. His petition contends, inter alia, that the government's attempt to apply section 241(a)(5) to his case has an impermissibly retroactive effect; that the summary reinstatement of the prior deportation order disregarded both statutorily mandated procedures and the dictates of the Due Process Clause; and that in the circumstances of this case, section 241(a)(5) must yield to a different (allegedly conflicting) INA provision. Because an order reinstating a prior removal order is \"the functional equivalent of a final order of removal,\" <i>Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 9, we have jurisdiction to hear and determine these contentions under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner and the amicus advance four principal arguments. We consider them in an order that roughly corresponds to the amount of energy that they have devoted to each.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Retroactivity.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The centerpiece of the petitioner's case is a claim that application of section 241(a)(5) to his circumstances is impermissibly retroactive. Since IIRIRA took effect <i>after</i> his illegal reentry in 1997, this thesis runs, retroactive application of the new reinstatement proviso would violate his settled expectation that he would be allowed to seek an adjustment of his immigration status following his marriage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether application of a statute to a given situation is impermissibly retroactive presents a quintessentially legal question. Judicial review is de novo and, accordingly, the agency's views garner no special deference. <i>Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 9-10 (explaining that \"courts, rather than agencies, are best equipped to make the constitutionally tinged judgment calls inherent in retroactivity determinations\"). We proceed on that basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is no doubt that Congress has the raw power to enact statutes that operate retroactively. <i>See Landgraf v. USI Film Prods.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">511</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">244</span></a></span>, 267, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">229</span></a></span> (1994). But because retroactive legislation has the potential to alter the consequences of actions already taken, courts start with a presumption that Congress intends to legislate prospectively. <i>Id.</i> at 272-73, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Congress can overcome this presumption and give legislation a retroactive effect only by clearly indicating its intent to do so. <i>Id.</i> at 268, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although this prong of the test requires Congress's intention to be unmistakable, our inquiry is not limited to the statutory text but may include an examination of standard ensigns of statutory construction, such as the statute's structure and legislative history. <i>See Martin v. Hadix,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118308\"><a href=\"/opinion/118308/martin-v-hadix/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">343</span></a></span>, 355-57, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118308\"><a href=\"/opinion/118308/martin-v-hadix/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

If this perscrutation leads to a firm conviction that Congress intended the statute to have a specific temporal reach, the retroactivity analysis ends and we will apply the statute in accordance with Congress's prescription. In the absence of such a directive, we will proceed to determine whether the application in question would have an impermissibly retroactive effect. <i>Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 280, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That result obtains if the specified application would \"impair rights a party possessed when he acted, increase a party's liability for past conduct, or impose new duties with respect to transactions already completed.\" <i>Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 280, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Otherwise, retroactive application is permissible. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case at hand, the search for express congressional intent need not occupy us for long. Three years ago, the Supreme Court ruled that Congress did not specify the temporal reach of section 304 of IIRIRA. <i>INS v. St. Cyr,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">289</span></a></span>, 320, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118452\"><a href=\"/opinion/118452/ins-v-st-cyr/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span> (2001). Building on that foundation, we concluded last year that section 241(a)(5) shared this characteristic. <i>Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 13. In forming that conclusion, we carefully examined both the text and legislative history of IIRIRA in general and section 241(a)(5) in particular. <i>Id.</i> at 11-13. This exercise left us with the conviction that \"section 241(a)(5) is hopelessly unclear as to whether it applies to those who illegally reentered the United States before April 1, 1997.\" <i>Id.</i> at 13. This panel is bound by that determination. <i>United States v. Wogan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564953\"><a href=\"/opinion/564953/united-states-v-russell-h-wogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1446</span></a></span>, 1449 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second step of the <i>Landgraf</i> pavane requires us to determine whether application of section 241(a)(5) to the petitioner's circumstances would have an impermissibly retroactive effect. The logical starting point for this inquiry is the ascertainment of what rights and justifiable expectations the petitioner may have had under the law as it existed immediately before IIRIRA's effective date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law did not change between the date when the petitioner illegally reentered the country (March 1, 1997) and IIRIRA's effective date (April 1, 1997). Under that regime, the petitioner was immediately deportable. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1227 (1994) (specifying grounds for deportation). There is no indication in the record that the petitioner ever sought, or qualified for, asylum. From aught that appears, in the spring of 1997 he would not have had any defense to deportation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, at that time the petitioner would not have been subject to summary reinstatement of the prior deportation order. Instead, deportability would have been determined in a new proceeding before an immigration judge. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 242.23 (repealed 1999). Pre-IIRIRA law would have allowed the petitioner, coincident with the commencement of that new proceeding, to apply for adjustment of his immigration status based upon his marriage, notwithstanding the fact that he had reentered the country illegally. INA &#167; 245, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that template, IIRIRA worked relatively few changes in the petitioner's situation. Substantively, he was still illegally in the country and still subject to deportation after the new law took effect. While section 241(a)(5) barred him from applying for any affirmative relief (such as an adjustment of status) from and after April 1, 1997, that change was inconsequential because there was no relief for which petitioner could then have qualified. After all, his wedding did not occur until July 5, 1999 (over two years after IIRIRA took effect).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the only consequence that IIRIRA added to the petitioner's illegal reentry was procedural: he was subject to having his prior deportation order peremptorily reinstated and was no longer entitled to a hearing before that reinstatement. That consequence is insufficient to derail the application of the new statute. As a general rule, the application of new procedural mechanisms to the adjudication of past conduct is not impermissibly retroactive. <i>Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 275, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1483</span></a></span>. More to the point, we previously have held that this precise procedural change falls within that general rule, not within the long-odds exception to it. <i>See Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 13 (holding that \"although aliens subject to reinstatement of a previous deportation order had a right to ... a hearing before the passage of the IIRIRA,... that right was procedural and, therefore, can be taken away retroactively\"). Other courts agree. <i>See, e.g., Ojeda-Terrazas v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"27587\"><a href=\"/opinion/27587/ojeda-terrazas-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">290</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 301-02 (5th Cir.2002); <i>Alvarez-Portillo v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776573\"><a href=\"/opinion/776573/alfonso-alvarez-portillo-v-john-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">280</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></a></span>, 865 (8th Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner nonetheless maintains that section 241(a)(5) ought not be applied to bar his application for adjustment of status because at the time section 241(a)(5) took effect, he planned to marry a United States citizen and thus become eligible for lawful permanent resident status. He points to the government's longstanding practice of allowing an alien illegally present in the United States to seek adjustment of status following marriage to a citizen and asserts that he was entitled to rely on this praxis. This assertion comprises more cry than wool.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A statute only has an impermissibly retroactive effect when it would change the legal consequences of actions actually taken (or refrained from) prior to the statute's effective date. <i>See Landgraf,</i> 511 U.S. at 280, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1483</span></a></span>. Inchoate plans to act in the future, even when made in anticipation of the legal consequences of those future actions, do not convey the type of settled expectation that retroactivity analysis seeks to protect. <i>See id.</i> at 269, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117841\"><a href=\"/opinion/117841/landgraf-v-usi-film-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1483</span></a></span> (noting that retroactive application of a statute is not impermissible merely because that application \"upsets expectations based in prior law\"). Because the petitioner did not marry (and thus, did not qualify for adjustment of status) until more than two years after IIRIRA's effective date, he cannot validly complain about the elimination of his ability to apply for a future adjustment of status. The decisive datum is that the petitioner had no sufficiently settled expectation that he could adjust his status <i>at the time section 241(a)(5) took effect,</i> because he was not yet married. Thus, applying that provision to the petitioner is not impermissibly retroactive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two loose ends. First, the petitioner asserts that because he applied for adjustment of status before the government actually reinstated the prior order of deportation, section 241(a)(5)'s bar to relief ought not to apply. We deem this argument squarely foreclosed by the text of the statute. Section 241(a)(5) subjects an illegal reentrant to three independent consequences: reinstatement of the prior deportation order, ineligibility for any relief, and removal. Grammatically, section 241(a)(5) does not make ineligibility for relief dependent upon reinstatement of the prior deportation order. And even if it did, section 241(a)(5) expressly makes reinstatement retroactive to the date of the original deportation order.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second loose end is a bit different. In a post-argument letter, <i>see</i> Fed. R.App. P. 28(j); 1st Cir. R. 28(j), the petitioner attempted to embrace the recent decision in <i>Perez-Gonzalez v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787359\"><a href=\"/opinion/787359/gregorio-perez-gonzalez-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">379</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span> (9th Cir.2004). That case involved the effect of a pending application for permission to reenter the country, filed after the petitioner illegally reentered, on the relief bar erected by section 241(a)(5). The Ninth Circuit stated that if the application were approved, that approval would cure the illegal reentry and section 241(a)(5) would not apply. <i>Id.</i> at 795. The petitioner now seeks to avail himself of this possible escape hatch.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, unlike in <i>Perez-Gonzalez,</i> the petitioner did not argue that approval of an application for permission to reenter would cure his illegal reentry; nor did he argue, by analogy, that the government's approval of his wife's \"immediate relative\" petition should be accorded a similar effect. It is readily apparent, then, that <i>Perez-Gonzalez</i> turns on a legal theory never explored either in the petitioner's briefs to this court or at oral argument. The usual rule, applicable here, is that new theories cannot be raised in a post-argument Rule 28(j) filing. <i>United States v. Nason,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195001\"><a href=\"/opinion/195001/united-states-v-nason/\"><span class=\"volume\">9</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span>, 163 (1st Cir.1993). It is arguable that this theory has been waived; at best, it has been forfeited. <i>See Bennett v. City of Holyoke,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200925\"><a href=\"/opinion/200925/bennett-v-city-of-holyoke/\"><span class=\"volume\">362</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, a forfeited argument occasionally can be resurrected under the plain error doctrine. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001). But that doctrine contains fairly rigorous criteria. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> It requires, at a bare minimum, that the complaining party point to a \"clear or obvious\" error. <i>Id.</i> Here, however, we have grave doubts about the correctness of the <i>Perez-Gonzalez</i> court's conclusion. It seems to us that permission to reenter, like adjustment of status, is relief under the INA, which section 241(a)(5) precludes an illegal reentrant from seeking. Furthermore, we find it difficult to accept the Ninth Circuit's heavy reliance on regulations that antedate IIRIRA in interpreting the reach of section 241(a)(5). We are, therefore, unable to find a clear or obvious error in ICE's decisionmaking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although that ends this phase of our analysis, we add a coda. We hold today only that application of section 241(a)(5) to deprive an alien who illegally reentered the country before IIRIRA's effective date of the ability to apply for relief for which the alien did not theretofore qualify is not impermissibly retroactive.

The petitioner contrasts this spartan regime with INA &#167; 240, which sets forth the procedures to be followed when determining removability in the first instance. In general, section 240 entitles aliens to be represented by counsel, to be heard by an immigration judge, to adduce evidence, and to cross-examine adverse witnesses. That section further provides:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unless otherwise specified in this chapter, a proceeding under this section shall be the sole and exclusive procedure for determining whether an alien may be ... removed from the United States....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(a)(3). The petitioner says that summary reinstatement of a deportation order sets up a parallel procedure for removal and thus conflicts with the quoted statute. In the petitioner's view, this renders the regulation ultra vires.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government retorts that summary reinstatement of a deportation order is not beyond the Attorney General's statutory authority because INA &#167; 241(a)(5) provides an explicit, congressionally sanctioned alternative to the otherwise exclusive procedure delineated in section 240. The government seeds its argument with persistent references to the legislative history. Those references indicate (or so the government says) that Congress intended aliens who reentered the country illegally after once having been deported to be treated as a separate class and removed expeditiously. <i>See, e.g.,</i> H.R.Rep. No. 104-469, pt. 1, at 13 (1996) (explaining that \"if aliens who are ordered removed ... seek reentry they are subject to immediate removal under the prior order\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's argument has a veneer of plausibility. After all, the decision to reinstate a prior deportation order is to some extent a determination as to whether an alien may be removed from the United States. <i>Cf. Arevalo,</i> 344 F.3d at 9 (holding, albeit in the context of appellate jurisdiction, that \"reinstatement itself operates as the functional equivalent of a final order of removal\"). This carapace, however, is easily pierced. Considering section 240 in the context of the INA as a whole, we conclude that its application to the reinstatement of earlier deportation orders is at best uncertain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For one thing, section 240 is primarily concerned with proceedings to determine whether aliens are excludable or deportable on one of the bases enumerated in INA &#167;&#167; 212 and 237, 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1182 and 1227. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1229a(a)(2) (\"An alien placed in proceedings under this section may be charged with any applicable ground of inadmissibility under [section 212] or any ground of deportability under [section 237].\"). In contrast, section 241 deals specifically with aliens who already have been ordered removed, and the placement of the reinstatement provision in a separate section logically can be understood as indicating a congressional intention to treat reinstatement determinations differently from first-instance determinations of removability. <i>Cf. Alexander v. Sandoval,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620697\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620697/alexander-v-sandoval/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 288-91, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620697\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620697/alexander-v-sandoval/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772045\"><a href=\"/opinion/772045/carlos-castro-cortez-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service-jose-luis/\"><span class=\"volume\">239</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1037</span></a></span>, 1040 n. 1 (9th Cir.2001). Congress apparently believed that the reinstatement regime should be altered dramatically, <i>Alvarez-Portillo,</i> 280 F.3d at 863, and reformed to function swiftly and simply. <i>See, e.g.,</i> S. Rep. 104-249, at 7 (1995) (\"Aliens who violate U.S. Immigration law should be removed from this country as soon as possible.\"); H.R.Rep. No. 104-469, <i>supra,</i> at 134 (calling pre-IIRIRA procedures \"cumbersome and duplicative,\" and positing that IIRIRA would correct these flaws). We think it unarguable that Congress intended IIRIRA to strengthen the reinstatement provision and to make it operate more efficiently. Viewed against this backdrop, it seems reasonable that, rather than spelling out procedural changes by statute, Congress may have expected the Attorney General to reevaluate the implementation of the reinstatement statute and to set in place a regulatory regimen that would further these goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That said, we find the government's statutory interpretation no more compelling. The text of section 241(a)(5) simply will not bear the weight that the Attorney General tries to pile upon it. To say, as does section 241(a)(5), that an alien \"shall be removed under the prior order at any time after... reentry\" says nothing about how the government may go about determining either the existence of a prior order or the fact of an illegal reentry. <i>See Castro-Cortez,</i> 239 F.3d at 1048. Nor does section 241(a)(5)'s bar on seeking relief from reinstatement of an earlier order necessarily indicate an intention that the prior order be reinstated peremptorily.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INA, taken as a whole, highlights this lack of certitude. When compared with other provisions explicitly authorizing alternative procedures, section 241(a)(5) looks even less like an explicit authorization. For example, section 235 of the INA, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1225, provides for summary removal proceedings for certain aliens upon their arrival in the United States. To take one case, that section provides that aliens who arrive without proper documentation shall be removed \"without further hearing or review.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1225(b)(1)(i). In a similar vein, stowaways are expressly ineligible for \"a hearing under [section 240].\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1225(a)(2). The absence of comparably explicit language in section 241(a)(5) reinforces our intuition that we should not read that section as evincing congressional intent to mandate summary procedures for reinstating prior deportation orders.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history marshaled by the government does not save the day. Although that history tends to cast doubt on the petitioner's assessment of the statutory scheme, <i>see</i> text <i>supra,</i> it is in the end inconclusive. Much like the statute itself, the legislative history indicates a general intent that illegal reentrants be removed expeditiously, but it does not address procedural questions with either clarity or specificity. The committee report quoted extensively by the government illustrates this point: although stating that \"[e]xisting procedures to deny entry to and remove illegal aliens from the United States are cumbersome and duplicative,\" H.R. Rep. 104-469, <i>supra,</i> at 134, it neither explicates nor endorses any particular procedures for reinstating removal orders. Given this indeterminacy, we decline to read a procedural mandate into section 241(a)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bottom line is that we find the INA ambiguous with regard to the procedures to be used when the government, in the post-IIRIRA era, seeks to reinstate a prior removal order against an illegal reentrant. Because the statutory scheme lacks clarity in this respect, we answer the first <i>Chevron</i> question in the negative and proceed to the second <i>Chevron</i> question. At that stage, we assay the government's implementation of the statute, as expressed in its rulemaking, mindful that we must defer to that rulemaking as long as we find it reasonable. <i>Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> 526 U.S. at 424, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118284\"><a href=\"/opinion/118284/ins-v-aguirre-aguirre/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2778</span></a></span>. We have little difficulty in concluding that the government's interpretation satisfies this condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, the legislative history shows that Congress, in enacting IIRIRA, sought to make the removal of illegal reentrants more expeditious. Providing a mechanical procedure for the reinstatement of prior orders is entirely consistent with this purpose. Moreover, we agree with the Eighth Circuit that the elimination of any exogenous defense to reinstatement significantly narrows the range of issues to be adjudicated, thereby limiting the value of additional procedures. <i>See Alvarez-Portillo,</i> 280 F.3d at 868 (\"The streamlined notice and opportunity to be heard afforded illegal reentrants under 8 C.F.R. &#167; 241.8 seem quite appropriate when the only issues to be determined are those establishing the agency's right to proceed under &#167; 241(a)(5) &#8212; the alien's identity, the existence of a prior removal order, and whether the alien has unlawfully reentered.\"). For these reasons, we conclude that it is reasonable to interpret the INA, as amended by IIRIRA, as giving the government authority to craft a streamlined procedure for the reinstatement of earlier deportation orders.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Due Process.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner next essays a constitutional challenge. He posits that even if the summary reinstatement procedure is not ultra vires, it nonetheless fails to pass muster under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We decline to address the merits of this argument. It is beyond peradventure that before a petitioner in an immigration case may advance a procedural due process claim, he must allege some cognizable prejudice fairly attributable to the challenged process. <i>See, e.g., Ojeda-Terrazas,</i> 290 F.3d at 302; <i>Bernal-Vallejo v.</i> <i>INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198702\"><a href=\"/opinion/198702/vallejo-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">195</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 64 (1st Cir.1999). That prerequisite is absent here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner does not dispute that when he left the United States in 1996, his departure constituted a self-deportation. Nor does he contest that he reentered the country illegally in 1997. Thus, the petitioner effectively has admitted all the facts necessary to warrant reinstatement of the original deportation order. It follows inexorably that he cannot show prejudice attributable to the government's use of a summary process in his case. <i>Ojeda-Terrazas,</i> 290 F.3d at 302. Consequently, we are without authority to reach his due process initiative.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>Section 245(i).</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the petitioner suggests that even if section 241(a)(5) is generally enforceable, he remains eligible to seek adjustment of status under INA &#167; 245(i), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(i). Because this suggestion rests on a matter of statutory construction, we undertake de novo review. <i>Strickland v. Comm'r, Me. Dep't of Human Servs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196992\"><a href=\"/opinion/196992/strickland-v-comm-maine/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">542</span></a></span>, 545 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">INA &#167; 245(i) allows certain classes of illegal aliens, including those who are spouses of United States citizens, to petition for adjustment of status. The petitioner posits that the availability of relief under section 245(i), especially in light of Congress's reenactment of that provision in 2000, conflicts with section 241(a)(5)'s bar on relief. He then invites us to resolve this perceived conflict by holding that section 245(i) effectively trumps section 241(a)(5), thus permitting an alien subject to the latter provision to apply for adjustment of status under the former provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short answer to this invitation is that the petitioner has erected a straw man: there is no meaningful conflict between sections 241(a)(5) and 245(i). Section 241(a)(5) only bars aliens who have illegally reentered the United States after having previously been deported from applying for relief. Many aliens illegally present in the United States (perhaps most such aliens) have never before been deported, and nothing in section 241(a)(5) prevents them from seeking adjustments of status under section 245(i). The mere fact that section 241(a)(5) precludes a subset of aliens from taking advantage of section 245(i) does not create a conflict. <i>Cf. Hughes v. Att'y Gen.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76662\"><a href=\"/opinion/76662/christopher-scott-hughes-v-eleventh-judicial/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1258</span></a></span>, 1268 (11th Cir.2004) (finding no conflict, for preemption purposes, when a federal statute only applied to a subset of activity regulated by the state statute, and the conduct in question fell outside that subset). We hold, therefore, that section 245(i) creates no impediment to the government's application of section 241(a)(5) in this case. <i>Accord Alvarez-Portillo,</i> 280 F.3d at 862.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. IIRIRA has tightened the screws on deportation proceedings in a variety of ways, and persons of good will can disagree as to the policy judgments that those stringencies reflect. Such judgments are, however, for the Congress, not for the courts. <i>See, e.g., Plumley v. S.

Since this issue has not been fully developed by the parties and since, in all events, we do not reach the constitutional question, <i>see</i> text <i>supra,</i> we have no occasion to reach this question. Thus, we leave open the possibility that the rule of avoidance might lead to a different statutory construction.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Although this case does not provide a vehicle for testing the merits of the constitutional claim, we do not mean to imply that the claim is insubstantial. The summary reinstatement process offers virtually no procedural protections. The regulation grants aliens to whom it applies nothing more than a chance to make a statement opposing reinstatement to an immigration officer (not to a judge). It guarantees the alien no notice before reinstatement of a prior deportation order, affords him no real opportunity to contest the facts underlying the reinstatement, and contemplates no presentation of evidence<i>See generally</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 241.8. While judicial review of reinstatement orders is available in the courts of appeals, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252, that review may not be adequate when the alien has not been given a meaningful opportunity to develop an administrative record.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
