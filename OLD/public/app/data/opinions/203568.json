Jaime Pieras, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                      Boudin, Lipez and Howard,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     José F. Sarraga, Eugene F. Hestres-Vélez and Bird Bird &\nHestres, P.S.C., on brief for appellant.\n     Rubén T. Nigaglioni, Veronica Ferraiuoli and Antonio\nValiente, Nigaglioni & Ferraiuoli Law Offices, P.S.C., on brief\nfor appellees.\n     Harvey Weiner, Jill M. Brannelly and Peabody & Arnold, LLP,\non brief amici curiae for Calvesbert Law Offices.\n\n\n                           November 17, 2008\n\f           Per   Curiam.    Defendant,     Eurobank,   appeals   from   the\n\ndistrict   court's    dismissal,   without   prejudice,   of   plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint for lack of prosecution.           The dismissal was based on\n\nplaintiffs' failure to file a memorandum prior to the initial\n\nscheduling conference, as required by the district court's initial\n\nscheduling conference order.       On appeal, Eurobank understandably\n\ndoes not object to the dismissal per se but argues that it should\n\nhave been with prejudice, as it had unsuccessfully argued in a\n\nmotion to amend the judgment.      A side issue, which turns out to be\n\nirrelevant, is whether the district court had subject matter\n\njurisdiction.    For the reasons discussed below--essentially, that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in dismissing this\n\ncase without, rather than with, prejudice--we summarily affirm.\n\n           Although    Eurobank    alleged    lack   of   subject   matter\n\njurisdiction in its answer to the complaint, it made no motion to\n\ndismiss the case on that ground, and the district court had no\n\noccasion to consider the issue before it dismissed the case at the\n\ninitial scheduling conference.      Regardless of whether the district\n\ncourt lacked subject matter jurisdiction over plaintiffs' claims,\n\nin the absence of a judicial determination that such jurisdiction\n\nwas lacking, the court had the power to \"requir[e] those practicing\n\nbefore [it] to conduct themselves in compliance with the applicable\n\nprocedural rules in the interim, and to . . . impose . . .\n\nsanctions in the event of their failure to do so,\"               Willy v.\n\n\n                                   - 2 -\n\fCoastal Corp., 503 U.S. 131, 139 (1992), at least where, as here,\n\nthe sanction \"'does not signify a district court's assessment of\n\nthe legal merits of the complaint.'\"             Id. (quoting Cooter & Gell v.\n\nHartmarx Corp., 496 U.S. 384, 396 (1992)).\n\n               Therefore, without resolving the question of subject\n\nmatter jurisdiction, we turn to the issue of whether dismissing the\n\ncase       without,   rather    than    with,   prejudice   was   an    abuse   of\n\ndiscretion and conclude that it was not.                Our resolution of that\n\nissue results largely from the highly deferential standard of\n\nappellate review that applies.              \"Since the district court has\n\nfirst-line       authority      for    case-management      decisions    and    is\n\nintimately familiar with the ebb and flow of the cases on its\n\ndocket, an appellate court should 'step softly' when asked to set\n\naside a district court's choice of sanctions for the violation of\n\na case-management order.\"             Torres v. Puerto Rico, 485 F.3d 5, 10\n\n(1st Cir. 2007).        Even if it would have been within the court's\n\ndiscretion       to   dismiss    the     case    with   prejudice--a     doubtful\n\nproposition,      given   \"no    pattern    of    the   plaintiffs     repeatedly\n\nflouting court orders,\"1 Benitez-Garcia v. Gonzalez-Vega, 468 F.3d\n\n\n       1\n      The only instance of noncompliance identified by the district\ncourt was plaintiffs' failure to file a memorandum prior to the\ninitial scheduling conference, as required by the court's initial\nscheduling conference order. Because there is no transcript of the\nscheduling conference in the record, and the appellant has not used\nthe procedures of Rule 10(c) of the Federal Rules of Appellate\nProcedure to create a record of that proceeding, we will disregard\nthe various unsupported representations of the parties and the\namicus as to precisely what transpired there. Bogan v. City of\n\n                                        - 3 -\n\f1, 5 (1st Cir. 2006); see also Link v. Wabash R.R. Co., 370 U.S.\n\n626, 64 (1962) (\"[declining to] decide whether unexplained absence\n\nfrom a pretrial conference would alone justify a dismissal with\n\nprejudice if the record showed no other evidence of dilatoriness on\n\nthe part of the plaintiff\")--that would not mean that dismissing it\n\nwithout prejudice was outside the court's discretion to choose a\n\nless severe sanction.   Cf. Benitez-Garcia, 468 F.3d at 6 (faulting\n\ndistrict court for failing to \"consider[] whether a sanction as\n\nsevere as dismissal with prejudice was needed or whether other\n\nsanctions might well have sufficed\").\n\n           Consequently, we summarily affirm the district court's\n\njudgment and its denial of the motion to amend.       1st Cir. R.\n\n27.0(c).   The motion of amici curiae for leave to participate in\n\noral argument is denied as moot.\n\n\n\n\nBoston, 489 F.3d 417, 424 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n                               - 4 -\n\f",
