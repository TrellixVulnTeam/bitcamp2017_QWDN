Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Richard F.

Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         April 9, 2004\n\f             TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.       Defendant-appellant Vincent\n\nWinn (\"Winn\") appeals the sentence imposed by the district court,\n\nobjecting to its enhancement under the career offender provisions\n\nof the federal sentencing guidelines.             U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1.       Winn\n\nargues that the government failed to show the requisite predicate\n\noffenses because his conviction of a Class B felony under the New\n\nHampshire escape statute, N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 642:6, does not\n\nconstitute     a   crime   of   violence    within   the   meaning   of   the\n\nguidelines.     We disagree and affirm Winn's enhanced sentence as a\n\ncareer offender.\n\n                                I.   Background\n\n             On January 9, 2003, Winn pleaded guilty to conspiracy to\n\ndistribute and to possess with intent to distribute fifty grams of\n\ncocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) & 846.            In the\n\nPresentence Investigation Report (\"PSI Report\") submitted to the\n\ndistrict court, Winn was deemed a career offender under § 4B1.1,\n\nbased in part on the predicate offense of a 1996 Class B felony\n\nconviction under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 642:6, in which it was\n\ncharged that Winn did \"knowingly escape from official custody in\n\nthat he walked away from the Calumet Halfway House . . . after\n\nhaving been confined there pursuant to an order of the Hillsborough\n\nCounty Superior Court.\"         Winn had failed to return to the halfway\n\nhouse after a break.       Four days later, he returned and surrendered\n\nhimself.\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f           The PSI Report characterized the escape conviction as a\n\ncrime of   violence    pursuant    to    U.S.S.G.      §    4B1.2(a)(2).       Winn\n\nobjected to the report and, at the sentencing hearing on April 10,\n\n2003, Winn argued that the non-violent nature of the escape charge\n\ncould be established by looking to the New Hampshire statute under\n\nwhich he was charged, which, he contends, distinguishes between\n\nviolent and non-violent escapes.               Moreover, Winn argued, the\n\nindictment itself shows that no element of violence was alleged or\n\ncharged, and the underlying facts suggest no threat of violence, as\n\nWinn voluntarily surrendered himself into custody four days after\n\nwalking away.\n\n           The   district       court        adopted        the   PSI   Report's\n\nrecommendation   and   deemed     Winn   a    career       offender.    Winn    was\n\nsentenced to 151 months imprisonment and five years of supervised\n\nrelease.   This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.     Analysis\n\n           We review de novo whether a crime qualifies as a crime of\n\nviolence within the meaning of § 4B1.2(a)(2) and therefore as a\n\npredicate offense under § 4B1.1.           United States v. De Jesús, 984\n\nF.2d 21, 22 n.4 (1st Cir. 1993)(citing United States v. Fiore, 983\n\nF.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\n           The sentencing guidelines define a \"crime of violence\" as\n\nany federal or state offense punishable by imprisonment for more\n\nthan one year that:\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f          (1) has as an element the use, attempted use,\n          or threatened use of physical force against\n          the person of another, or (2) is burglary of a\n          dwelling, arson, or extortion, involves use of\n          explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that\n          presents a serious potential risk of physical\n          injury to another.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a).    Following Taylor v. United States, 495 U.S.\n\n575 (1990), courts have taken a formal categorical approach to the\n\nquestion of whether a felony constitutes a crime of violence within\n\nthis definition.   United States v. Winter, 22 F.3d 15, 18 (1st Cir.\n\n1994)(\"As a rule, this type of approach is restricted to an\n\nexamination of how the legislature has defined the crime, without\n\nany concomitant inquiry into the details of the defendant's actual\n\ncriminal conduct.\").1    \"Thus, rather than examining the actual\n\ncircumstances underlying the earlier conviction, we examine only\n\nthe statutory formulation of the crime charged . . . to see if that\n\ncrime is a crime of violence for the purposes of the career\n\noffender guideline.\"    De Jesús, 984 F.2d at 23.   In some limited\n\ncircumstances, however, a court \"may appropriately peruse documents\n\n\n\n\n1\n   Although Taylor applied the categorical approach to determine\nwhat constitutes a \"violent felony\" under the Armed Career Criminal\nAct (\"ACCA\"), Taylor, 495 U.S. at 600-02, courts have uniformly\nadopted the Taylor approach for the analogous determination of what\nconstitutes a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines.\n\"Given the substantial similarity between the Armed Career Criminal\nAct's definition of 'violent felony,' and the Sentencing\nCommission's definition of 'crime of violence,' authority\ninterpreting one phrase is found to be persuasive in interpreting\nthe other phrase.\" Winter, 22 F.3d at 18 n.3 (internal citations\nomitted).\n\n                                -4-\n\fsuch as the charging papers or jury instructions in order to flesh\n\nout a predicate offense inquiry.\"       Id. at 23 n.5.2\n\n          The New Hampshire escape statute under which Winn was\n\ncharged provides as follows:\n\n          I.   A person is guilty of an offense if he\n          escapes from official custody.\n\n          II. \"Official custody\" means arrest, custody\n          in a penal institution, an institution for\n          confinement of juvenile offenders or other\n          confinement pursuant to an order of a court.\n\n          III. The offense is a class A felony if the\n          actor employs force against any person or\n          threatens any person with a deadly weapon to\n          effect the escape, except that if the deadly\n          weapon is a firearm, he shall be sentenced in\n          accordance with RSA 651:2, II-g. Otherwise it\n          is a class B felony.\n\nN.H. Rev. Stat. Ann. § 642:6.          The statute thus distinguishes\n\nbetween Class A and Class B felony escapes based on the use of\n\nforce or of a deadly weapon.\n\n          Winn   argues   that   the    New   Hampshire   statute   thus\n\ndistinguishes between violent and non-violent escapes, and that a\n\nClass B escape conviction can be identified as non-violent without\n\nlooking beyond the charge.   The government concedes that the Class\n\nB felony of which Winn was charged does not have \"as an element the\n\nuse, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the\n\n\n2\n   The question of exactly which documents may be considered to\nascertain whether a conviction involved a violent or a non-violent\ncrime has been raised in several cases before this court, see,\ne.g., United States v. Shepard, 348 F.3d 308 (1st Cir. 2003), but\nis not raised here.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fperson of another,\" U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a)(1), but argues that the\n\ncharged offense \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious\n\npotential risk of physical injury to another.\" U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2\n\n(a)(2).\n\n              We have previously held that \"even if force (actual or\n\nthreatened) is not an element of the offense, a crime may still be\n\na crime of violence if it falls within the 'otherwise' clause of\n\nsubsection (ii), that is, if it 'involves conduct that presents a\n\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another.'\"                 De Jesús,\n\n984 F.2d at 23 (quoting U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a)(2)).                  While escape is\n\nnot   among    the   offenses,      such   as     murder,   manslaughter,      and\n\nkidnapping, listed in the Sentencing Commission's application notes\n\nto § 4B1.2, this absence is not dispositive.                 \"Expanding on the\n\n'otherwise' clause, the application notes explain that '[o]ther\n\noffenses are included where . . . the conduct set forth (i.e.,\n\nexpressly     charged)   in   the    count   of    which    the    defendant   was\n\nconvicted . . . , by its nature, presented a serious potential risk\n\nof physical injury to another.'\" De Jesús, 984 F.2d at 24 (quoting\n\nU.S.S.G. § 4B1.2, cmt. n.2).3          The question before us, then, is\n\n\n\n3\n   Winn refers us to a 1988 application note to § 4B1.2 that, in\nelaborating on the Sentencing Commission's definition of a \"crime\nof violence,\" offered the following directive: \"For example,\nconviction for an escape accomplished by force or threat of injury\nwould be covered; conviction for an escape by stealth would not be\ncovered.\" U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2 cmt. n.1 (1988). As this is no longer\npart of the notes to § 4B1.2 and no explanation is offered for its\ndisappearance, we do not take it into consideration.\n\n                                       -6-\n\f\"whether [a Class B felony escape under N.H. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\n§ 642:6] is a category of crime that, by its nature, presents a\n\nsubstantial risk of personal injury even though its statutorily\n\ndefined elements do not include the use or threat of force.\"    De\n\nJesús, 984 F.2d at 24.\n\n          Our sister circuits have uniformly held that, as a\n\ncategorical matter, any escape, however effected, \"involves conduct\n\nthat presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to\n\nanother\" and thus constitutes a crime of violence for the purposes\n\nof the sentencing guidelines.   United States v. Bryant, 310 F.3d\n\n550, 554 (7th Cir. 2002)(failure to report back to halfway house\n\nconstitutes a crime of violence because \"every escape involves a\n\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another\")(internal\n\nquotations omitted); United States v. Luster, 305 F.3d 199, 202 (3d\n\nCir. 2002)(rejecting the argument that if an escape statute extends\n\nto \"walk away\" escapes the crime cannot by its nature present a\n\nserious potential risk of physical injury to another); United\n\nStates v. Nation, 243 F.3d 467, 472 (8th Cir. 2001)(same)(\"We\n\nbelieve that every escape, even a so-called 'walkaway' escape,\n\ninvolves a potential risk of injury to others . . . . Even the most\n\npeaceful escape cannot eliminate the potential for violent conflict\n\nwhen the authorities attempt to recapture the escapee.\"); United\n\nStates v. Gay, 251 F.3d 950, 954-55 (11th Cir. 2001)(same); United\n\nStates v. Ruiz, 180 F.3d 675, 676-77 (5th Cir. 1999)(same); United\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fStates v. Harris, 165 F.3d 1062, 1068 (6th Cir. 1999)(same); United\n\nStates v. Mitchell, 113 F.3d 1528, 1533 (10th Cir. 1997)(same);\n\nUnited States v. Dickerson, 77 F.3d 774, 777 (4th Cir. 1996)(same).\n\n            Circuit courts that have addressed the analogous question\n\nof whether an escape conviction qualifies as a \"violent felony\"\n\nunder the Armed Career Criminal Act (\"ACCA\") have similarly applied\n\nthe categorical Taylor analysis to conclude that escape, by its\n\nnature, involves \"conduct that presents a serious potential risk of\n\nphysical injury to another.\"     United States v. Jackson, 301 F.3d\n\n59, 62-63 (2d Cir. 2002); United States v. Franklin, 302 F.3d 722\n\n(7th Cir. 2002); United States v. Hairston, 71 F.3d 115, 117-18\n\n(4th Cir. 1995).   In Jackson, the court reasoned that \"[a]n inmate\n\nwho escapes by peacefully walking away from a work site will (if he\n\ncan) be inconspicuous and discreet, and will (if he can) avoid\n\nconfrontation and force.      But escape invites pursuit; and the\n\npursuit, confrontation, and recapture of the escapee entail serious\n\nrisks of physical injury to law enforcement officers and the\n\npublic.\"    Jackson, 301 F.3d at 63.\n\n            The categorical approach has thus led to the conclusion\n\nthat \"under the ACCA and the United States Sentencing Guidelines,\n\nescape is always a violent crime.      It is irrelevant whether the\n\nescape actually involved any violence or whether defendant was\n\nconvicted under a state statute that defines escape as a nonviolent\n\noffense.\"   United States v. Springfield, 196 F.3d 1180, 1185 (10th\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fCir. 1999).      Even when the state escape statute \"distinguishes\n\nbetween an escape effected by or facilitated by violence, versus a\n\nsimple escape,\" the categorical approach has yielded the same\n\nconclusion,      on    the   grounds     that      \"[e]ven   though    initial\n\ncircumstances of an escape may be non-violent, there is no way to\n\npredict   what    an    escapee   will       do   when   encountered   by   the\n\nauthorities.\"     United States v. Turner, 285 F.3d 909, 915-16 (10th\n\nCir. 2002).\n\n          The great majority of these cases rely on the \"powder\n\nkeg\" rationale of United States v. Gosling:\n\n          [E]very escape scenario is a powder keg, which\n          may or may not explode into violence and\n          result in physical injury to someone at any\n          given time, but which always has the serious\n          potential to do so. A defendant who escapes\n          from a jail is likely to possess a variety of\n          supercharged emotions, and in evading those\n          trying to recapture him, may feel threatened\n          by police officers, ordinary citizens, or even\n          fellow escapees. Consequently, violence could\n          erupt at any time.    Indeed, even in a case\n          where a defendant escapes from a jail by\n          stealth and injures no one in the process,\n          there is still a serious potential risk that\n          injury will result when officers find the\n          defendant and attempt to place him in custody.\n\n39 F.3d 1140, 1142 (10th Cir. 1994)(internal citation omitted).\n\nWinn contends that the \"powder keg\" rationale unjustifiably ignores\n\nthe category of genuinely passive, non-violent walk-away escapes or\n\nfailures to return, which he suggests present no greater risk of\n\nviolence than any other arrest of a non-violent offender.\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f           Winn's      argument   echoes     the   D.C.       Circuit's    recent\n\nexpression of reluctance to adopt this categorical approach to\n\nescapes:\n\n           Arguably, the approach taken by the other\n           circuits proves too much.    While it may be\n           true that the recapture of an escapee\n           inherently   contains   a  risk   of   violent\n           encounter   between   the  escapee   and   the\n           arresting officers, the same is true as to the\n           capture of any lawbreaker. . . . Therefore, we\n           are reluctant to adopt the categorical\n           approach.\n\nUnited States v. Thomas, 333 F.3d 280, 282 (D.C. Cir. 2003).                    The\n\ncourt proceeded to note that \"[a] prisoner not returning to a\n\nhalfway house or sneaking away from an unguarded position in the\n\nnight may not inherently create a risk of harm to others.\"                 Id. at\n\n283.   In a concurring opinion under ACCA, Judge McKay of the Tenth\n\nCircuit has similarly expressed discomfort with the categorical\n\napproach to escapes, particularly when a state statute defines a\n\nfailure to return as a felony escape.         United States v. Adkins, 196\n\nF.3d 1112, 1119 (10th Cir. 1999)(McKay, J., concurring)(\"There is\n\na quantum difference between the assumptions about the intrinsic\n\ndanger of unauthorized departure from actual custody, as in this\n\ncase, and of failure to return from authorized departure from\n\nactual custody.\").\n\n           As   discussed    above,    however,    the       formal   categorical\n\napproach   is   the    well-established      method     in    this    Circuit   for\n\ndetermining     what   constitutes     a   crime   of    violence      under    the\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fsentencing guidelines.     De Jesús, 984 F.2d at 23.         In fact, the\n\ninitial enunciation of the \"powder keg\" rationale in Gosling cited\n\nto this Circuit's holding in De Jesús that larceny from the person\n\nqualifies as a crime of violence under 4B1.2 because it inherently\n\ninvolves the serious potential risk of injury to others, even\n\nthough not every larceny will involve violence.           Gosling, 39 F.3d\n\nat 1142 (citing De Jesús, 984 F.2d at 24-25).\n\n          The formal categorical approach forecloses the conclusion\n\nthat a Class B felony escape under N.H. Rev. Stat. 642:6 does not\n\npresent a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\n\nThe New Hampshire statute, while distinguishing escapes effected by\n\nforce or with a deadly weapon, does not distinguish among types of\n\nconfinement.     The Class B felony, thus, covers a category of\n\nescapes that includes both Winn's failure to return from a break at\n\na halfway house and the prisoner who manages to break out of jail\n\nby stealth.    Indeed, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire has noted\n\nthat \"[t]he all-encompassing definition of 'official custody' in\n\nRSA 642:6 strongly supports an inference that the statute . . . was\n\nintended to    govern   escapes   of   all    kinds,\"   regardless   of   the\n\ninstitution or type of confinement.          State v. Perra, 503 A.2d 814,\n\n816 (N.H. 1985).   We agree with our sister circuits that \"even in\n\na case where a defendant escapes from a jail by stealth and injures\n\nno one in the process, there is still a serious potential risk that\n\ninjury will result when officers find the defendant and attempt to\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fplace him in custody.\"     Gosling, 39 F.3d at 1142.    Thus, as a\n\ncategorical matter, a Class B felony escape under N.H. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn. 642:6 \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk\n\nof physical injury to another,\" U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2(a)(2), and is\n\nproperly characterized as a crime of violence for the purposes of\n\ncareer offender enhancement under the sentencing guidelines.   The\n\ndistrict court did not err in sentencing Winn as a career offender.\n\n                          III.   Conclusion\n\n            The sentence imposed by the district court is therefore\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\f",

In the Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSI Report\") submitted to the district court, Winn was deemed a career offender under &#167; 4B1.1, based in part on the predicate offense of a 1996 Class B felony conviction under N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. &#167; 642:6, in which it was charged that Winn did \"knowingly escape from official custody in that he walked away from the Calumet Halfway House ... after having been confined there pursuant to an order of the Hillsborough County Superior Court.\" Winn had failed to return to the halfway house after a break.

Winn objected to the report and, at the sentencing hearing on April 10, 2003, Winn argued that the non-violent nature of the escape charge could be established by looking to the New Hampshire statute under which he was charged, which, he contends, distinguishes between violent and non-violent escapes. Moreover, Winn argued, the indictment itself shows that no element of violence was alleged or charged, and the underlying facts suggest no threat of violence, as Winn voluntarily surrendered himself into custody four days after walking away.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the PSI Report's recommendation and deemed Winn a career offender.

The government concedes that the Class B felony of which Winn was charged does not have \"as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another,\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(a)(1), but argues that the charged offense \"otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2 (a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously held that \"even if force (actual or threatened) is not an element of the offense, a crime may still be a crime of violence if it falls within the `otherwise' clause of subsection (ii), that is, if it `involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.'\" <i>De Jes&#250;s,</i> 984 F.2d at 23 (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(a)(2)). While escape is not among the offenses, such as murder, manslaughter, and kidnapping, listed in the Sentencing Commission's application notes to &#167; 4B1.2, this absence is not dispositive. \"Expanding on the `otherwise' clause, the application notes explain that `[o]ther offenses are included where ... the conduct set forth (i.e., expressly charged) in the count of which the defendant was convicted ..., by its nature, presented a serious potential risk of physical injury to another.'\" <i>De Jes&#250;s,</i> 984 F.2d at 24 (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2, cmt. n. 2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The question before us, then, is \"whether [a Class B felony escape under N.H.Rev.Stat.

Jackson,</i> 301 F.3d 59, 62-63 (2d Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Franklin,</i> 302 F.3d 722 (7th Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Hairston,</i> 71 F.3d 115, 117-18 (4th Cir.1995). In <i>Jackson,</i> the court reasoned that \"[a]n inmate who escapes by peacefully walking away from a work site will (if he can) be inconspicuous and discreet, and will (if he can) avoid confrontation and force. But escape invites pursuit; and the pursuit, confrontation, and recapture of the escapee entail serious risks of physical injury to law enforcement officers and the public.\" <i>Jackson,</i> 301 F.3d at 63.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The categorical approach has thus led to the conclusion that \"under the ACCA and the United States Sentencing Guidelines, escape is always a violent crime.

Springfield,</i> 196 F.3d 1180, 1185 (10th Cir.1999). Even when the state escape statute \"distinguishes between an escape effected by or facilitated by violence, versus a simple escape,\" the categorical approach has yielded the same conclusion, on the grounds that \"[e]ven though initial circumstances of an escape may be non-violent, there is no way to predict what an escapee will do when encountered by the authorities.\" <i>United States v.

A defendant who escapes from a jail is likely to possess a variety of supercharged emotions, and in evading those trying to recapture him, may feel threatened by police officers, ordinary citizens, or even fellow escapees. Consequently, violence could erupt at any time. Indeed, even in a case where a defendant escapes from a jail by stealth and injures no one in the process, there is still a serious potential risk that injury will result when officers find the defendant and attempt to place him in custody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">39 F.3d 1140, 1142 (10th Cir.1994)(internal citation omitted). Winn contends that the \"powder keg\" rationale unjustifiably ignores the category of genuinely passive, non-violent walk-away escapes or failures to return, which he suggests present no greater risk of violence than any other arrest of a non-violent offender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Winn's argument echoes the D.C.

While it may be true that the recapture of an escapee inherently contains a risk of violent encounter between the escapee and the arresting officers, the same is true as to the capture of any lawbreaker.... Therefore, we are reluctant to adopt the categorical approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Thomas,</i> 333 F.3d 280, 282 (D.C.Cir.2003). The court proceeded to note that \"[a] prisoner not returning to a halfway house or sneaking away from an unguarded position in the night may not inherently create a risk of harm to others.\" <i>Id.</i> at 283. In a concurring opinion under ACCA, Judge McKay of the Tenth Circuit has similarly expressed discomfort with the categorical approach to escapes, particularly when a state statute defines a failure to return as a felony escape. <i>United States v. Adkins,</i> 196 F.3d 1112, 1119 (10th Cir.1999)(McKay, J., concurring)(\"There is a quantum difference between the assumptions about the intrinsic danger of unauthorized departure from actual custody, as in this case, and of failure to return from authorized departure from actual custody.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As discussed above, however, the formal categorical approach is the well-established method in this Circuit for determining what constitutes a crime of violence under the sentencing guidelines. <i>De Jes&#250;s,</i> 984 F.2d at 23. In fact, the initial enunciation of the \"powder keg\" rationale in <i>Gosling</i> cited to this Circuit's holding in <i>De Jes&#250;s</i> that larceny from the person qualifies as a crime of violence under 4B1.2 because it inherently involves the serious potential risk of injury to others, even though not every larceny will involve violence. <i>Gosling,</i> 39 F.3d at 1142 (citing <i>De Jes&#250;s,</i> 984 F.2d at 24-25).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The formal categorical approach forecloses the conclusion that a Class B felony escape under N.H.Rev.Stat. 642:6 does not present a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. The New Hampshire statute, while distinguishing escapes effected by force or with a deadly weapon, does not distinguish among types of confinement. The Class B felony, thus, covers a category of escapes that includes both Winn's failure to return from a break at a halfway house and the prisoner who manages to break out of jail by stealth. Indeed, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire has noted that \"[t]he all-encompassing definition of `official custody' in RSA 642:6 strongly supports an inference that the statute ... was intended to govern escapes of all kinds,\" regardless of the institution or type of confinement. <i>State v. Perra,</i> 127 N.H. 533, 503 A.2d 814, 816 (1985). We agree with our sister circuits that \"even in a case where a defendant escapes from a jail by stealth and injures no one in the process, there is still a serious potential risk that injury will result when officers find the defendant and attempt to place him in custody.\" <i>Gosling,</i> 39 F.3d at 1142. Thus, as a categorical matter, a Class B felony escape under N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. 642:6 \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(a)(2), and is properly characterized as a crime of violence for the purposes of career offender enhancement under the sentencing guidelines.

Even when the state escape statute \"distinguishes between an escape effected by or facilitated by violence, versus a simple escape,\" the categorical approach has yielded the same conclusion, on the grounds that \"[e]ven though initial circumstances of an escape may be non-violent, there is no way to predict what an escapee will do when encountered by the authorities.\" <i>United States v.

A defendant who escapes from a jail is likely to possess a variety of supercharged emotions, and in evading those trying to recapture him, may feel threatened by police officers, ordinary citizens, or even fellow escapees. Consequently, violence could erupt at any time. Indeed, even in a case where a defendant escapes from a jail by stealth and injures no one in the process, there is still a serious potential risk that injury will result when officers find the defendant and attempt to place him in custody.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"681706\"><a href=\"/opinion/681706/united-states-v-mark-tracy-gosling-aka-mark-t-gosling/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span></a></span>, 1142 (10th Cir.1994)(internal citation omitted). Winn contends that the \"powder keg\" rationale unjustifiably ignores the category of genuinely passive, non-violent walk-away escapes or failures to return, which he suggests present no greater risk of violence than any other arrest of a non-violent offender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Winn's argument echoes the D.C.

While it may be true that the recapture of an escapee inherently contains a risk of violent encounter between the escapee and the arresting officers, the same is true as to the capture of any lawbreaker....

The court proceeded to note that \"[a] prisoner not returning to a halfway house or sneaking away from an unguarded position in the night may not inherently create a risk of harm to others.\" <i>Id.</i> at 283. In a concurring opinion under ACCA, Judge McKay of the Tenth Circuit has similarly expressed discomfort with the categorical approach to escapes, particularly when a state statute defines a failure to return as a felony escape. <i>United States v.

In fact, the initial enunciation of the \"powder keg\" rationale in <i>Gosling</i> cited to this Circuit's holding in <i>De Jes&#250;s</i> that larceny from the person qualifies as a crime of violence under 4B1.2 because it inherently involves the serious potential risk of injury to others, even though not every larceny will involve violence. <i>Gosling,</i> 39 F.3d at 1142 (citing <i>De Jes&#250;s,</i> 984 F.2d at 24-25).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The formal categorical approach forecloses the conclusion that a Class B felony escape under N.H.Rev.Stat. 642:6 does not present a serious potential risk of physical injury to another. The New Hampshire statute, while distinguishing escapes effected by force or with a deadly weapon, does not distinguish among types of confinement. The Class B felony, thus, covers a category of escapes that includes both Winn's failure to return from a break at a halfway house and the prisoner who manages to break out of jail by stealth. Indeed, the Supreme Court of New Hampshire has noted that \"[t]he all-encompassing definition of `official custody' in RSA 642:6 strongly supports an inference that the statute ... was intended to govern escapes of all kinds,\" regardless of the institution or type of confinement. <i>State v. Perra,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.H.</span> <span class=\"page\">533</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">503</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">814</span></span>, 816 (1985). We agree with our sister circuits that \"even in a case where a defendant escapes from a jail by stealth and injures no one in the process, there is still a serious potential risk that injury will result when officers find the defendant and attempt to place him in custody.\" <i>Gosling,</i> 39 F.3d at 1142. Thus, as a categorical matter, a Class B felony escape under N.H.Rev.Stat. Ann. 642:6 \"involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another,\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.2(a)(2), and is properly characterized as a crime of violence for the purposes of career offender enhancement under the sentencing guidelines.
