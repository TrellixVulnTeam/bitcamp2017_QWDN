Kenyatti Jordan appeals the\n\ndenial of his habeas corpus petition.                  In his petition, Jordan\n\nclaimed that (1) incriminating statements he made to police were\n\nsubject to a proffer agreement and therefore admitted in error or,\n\nin the alternative, were given involuntarily due to deception, and\n\n(2) the restrictions placed by the state trial court on his\n\nquestioning of two witnesses violated his constitutional rights.\n\nThe district court denied the petition; as Jordan has not shown\n\nthat the state court’s decision was contrary to or an unreasonable\n\napplication     of        federal    law,    or     based   on     an    unreasonable\n\ndetermination of the facts, we affirm.\n\n                          FACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\n\n     On February 21, 1994, Joseph Dozier was shot and killed in\n\nBoston, Massachusetts.              Although police suspected that Kenyatti\n\nJordan was involved in the shooting, they did not file any charges\n\nat that time.        In 1996, while on probation for unrelated crimes,\n\nJordan   worked      as    an   informant     for   various      state   and   federal\n\nagencies.   Due to unrelated arrests, Jordan was scheduled to have\n\nhis probation revoked in early 1997.                   In an effort to retain\n\nJordan’s assistance, federal agents contacted the state police and\n\noffered Jordan’s aid in investigating the Dozier murder in exchange\n\nfor intervention in the probation revocation hearing.\n\n     On January 9, 1997, a meeting was held at the United States\n\nAttorney’s office in Boston.                The participants were Jordan, two\n\n\n                                            -2-\n\fBoston police detectives, Herbert Spellman and Paul Joyce, two\n\nfederal agents, Steve Mitchell and Domenic Colameta, and Assistant\n\nUnited States Attorney George Vien. Vien prepared a proffer letter\n\nfor Jordan, which provided that the U.S. Attorney would not use any\n\ntruthful statements that Jordan made against him but could conduct\n\nfurther investigation based on those statements.                The Boston\n\ndetectives did not say anything about the letter, and the state\n\ntrial judge found that they believed the letter had no effect on\n\nstate court proceedings.\n\n     The two detectives then took Jordan to a separate room to be\n\ninterviewed,   telling   the   federal   agents   that   they   could   not\n\nparticipate.   There, Detective Spellman told Jordan that there\n\nwould be no promises about the interview, and that anything Jordan\n\nsaid would be relayed to the district attorney.            Spellman then\n\nMirandized Jordan, whereupon Jordan left the room to talk to the\n\nfederal agents about the lack of immunity.        Mitchell went into the\n\ninterview room and spoke to Spellman, who told Mitchell that only\n\nthe district attorney could grant immunity. Mitchell then left the\n\nroom and told Jordan to go back in and tell the truth.                   On\n\nreturning to the interview room, Jordan told Spellman that he had\n\narrived at and fled the scene of the Dozier murder with Antonio\n\nJones, who was another suspect in the Dozier murder, but that Jones\n\nhad shot Dozier while Jordan remained far away.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f     During two subsequent interviews with the detectives, at each\n\nof which Jordan was given Miranda warnings, Jordan changed his\n\nstory, admitting that he stood next to Jones during the shooting.\n\nBased on this admission and the observations of an eyewitness who\n\nsaw two men stand side by side and both shoot Dozier, Jordan was\n\narrested and charged with Dozier’s murder.\n\n     Jordan moved to suppress all three sets of his statements to\n\npolice, arguing that the proffer letter applied to the interview\n\nwith the Boston detectives, or in the alternative, that because of\n\ndeception on the part of the detectives, those statements were\n\ngiven under duress and involuntary.        The trial judge denied the\n\nmotion, finding, among other things, that the interview was non-\n\ncustodial and non-coercive, that Jordan was fully aware of his\n\nMiranda rights, was alert and lucid, and knew the letter did not\n\nprovide protection against the use in state court of anything he\n\nmight say at the interview.       The judge concluded that Jordan’s\n\nstatement to the detectives was a “product of his free will and\n\nrational intellect and was voluntary.”\n\n     At trial, Jordan sought to demonstrate that the Boston and\n\nfederal investigators acted purposefully to deceive him into making\n\nincriminating    statements.      During   his     cross-examination    of\n\nDetective Spellman, Jordan asked, “[w]as it your concern that in\n\nthe privacy of this meeting when you started to discuss Miranda\n\nissues   that   [the   Federal   agents]   might    object   to   Jordan’s\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\ftestimony?”     The prosecution objected to the question, and the\n\ntrial court sustained the objection.         On direct examination, Agent\n\nMitchell testified about his conversation with the detectives\n\nregarding Jordan’s lack of immunity. The prosecution objected, and\n\nthe trial court struck the answer.        A jury found Jordan guilty of\n\nfirst degree murder, based on premeditation and extreme atrocity or\n\ncruelty, and unlawful possession of a firearm.\n\n     On appeal, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC)\n\naffirmed the conviction.       It upheld the denial of the motion to\n\nsuppress, holding that the trial judge’s factual findings were\n\nsupported by the evidence and consistent with prior case law.            The\n\ncourt also found no abuse of discretion in the trial court’s\n\nexclusion of testimony.      The court held that the question posed to\n\nSpellman was cumulative and only marginally relevant, and that\n\nJordan   was    able   to   extensively   question    Spellman   regarding\n\npotential bias.    Similarly, it held that Mitchell’s testimony was\n\ncumulative     regarding    voluntariness,    and   the   conversation   in\n\nquestion was never relayed to Jordan.\n\n     Jordan then filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in the\n\ndistrict court. Though troubled by the facts, the court denied the\n\npetition in a careful and detailed ruling, concluding that while\n\nthere were two plausible versions of the facts, the evidence was\n\nsufficient to affirm the version adopted by the state courts, from\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fwhich one could reasonably conclude that Jordan’s waiver was made\n\nknowingly and voluntarily.\n\n\n\n                              LEGAL STANDARD\n\n     This court reviews a district court’s denial of a petition for\n\nhabeas corpus de novo.       Obershaw v. Lanman, 453 F.3d 56, 59 (1st\n\nCir. 2006), rehearing denied (1st Cir. July 26, 2006).                  Because\n\nJordan’s   petition    was   filed   after    the   effective   date    of   the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254, the district court was correct in applying that Act.              Under\n\nAEDPA, a federal court can grant habeas relief only where a state\n\ncourt adjudication\n\n           (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary\n           to, or involved an unreasonable application\n           of, clearly established Federal law, as\n           determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n           States; or (2) . . . was based on an\n           unreasonable determination of the facts in\n           light of the evidence presented in the state\n           court proceeding.”\n\n28   U.S.C.   §   2254(d)(1)-(2).            The    state   court’s     factual\n\ndeterminations are entitled to a presumption of correctness, which\n\nmust be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.                  28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(e)(1); see also Obershaw, 453 F.3d at 59.\n\n                                DISCUSSION\n\n     Jordan’s principal argument is that the Boston detectives were\n\nbound by the proffer letter given by the federal prosecutor.                 The\n\nproffer    agreement   had    been   made     before    Detective      Spellman\n\n                                     -6-\n\fquestioned       Jordan.   Jordan argues that, because states are bound\n\nby federal law, the federal prosecutor’s promise of use immunity is\n\nbinding on the state authorities.             For support, he cites Murphy v.\n\nWaterfront Comm’n, 378 U.S. 52 (1964).               Murphy held in substance\n\nthat if a witness is given state immunity and compelled to give\n\npotentially incriminating testimony in state proceedings, he must\n\nlikewise    be    immunized   from     use    of   that    testimony   in   federal\n\nproceedings.       Id. at 79.     But Murphy gives no comfort to Jordan.\n\nJordan was not under compulsion to testify in either jurisdiction.\n\nThus his claim of being whipsawed is without substance.                       Even\n\nassuming an argument for extending Murphy could be made in this\n\ncase, the standard of review contained in AEDPA makes this argument\n\nhopeless.\n\n     The second string to Jordan’s bow is his contention that his\n\nstatements to the detectives could not have been found to have been\n\nvoluntarily      made.     That   is   because,      according    to   Jordan,   he\n\nreasonably believed that the assurance from the assistant United\n\nStates attorney that anything he said could not be used against him\n\ncarried over to his interview with the Boston detectives. But here\n\nhis argument runs squarely into AEDPA.              Under AEDPA, habeas relief\n\nis precluded unless the state court adjudication was based on “an\n\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\n\npresented in the State court proceeding.”                 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2).\n\nMoreover, a state court determination of factual issues “shall be\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fpresumed to be correct” unless petitioner rebuts the “presumption\n\nof correctness by clear and convincing evidence.”                  28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(e)(1).      Jordan has offered no evidence that the state\n\ncourt’s   determination   was    unreasonable,      much   less    clear    and\n\nconvincing     evidence   that   the      court’s    factual      finding    of\n\nvoluntariness was incorrect.\n\n     Finally, Jordan contends that he was denied due process when\n\nthe trial court restricted his cross-examination of Detective\n\nSpellman, and struck one of Agent Mitchell’s statements on direct\n\nexamination.\n\n     The SJC held that the trial court’s restriction of Spellman’s\n\ncross examination was not error.        Jordan argues that this holding\n\nis an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law as stated in\n\nWashington v. Texas, 388 U.S. 14 (1967).            But this is not a case\n\nwhere the court’s ruling “significantly undermined fundamental\n\nelements of the defendant’s defense.”         United States v. Scheffer,\n\n523 U.S. 303, 315 (1998) (citing Washington, 388 U.S. at 23), or\n\nbarred all inquiry into an area of possible bias or motive.                 See\n\nDelaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 679 (1986).             Rather, as the\n\nSJC found, at trial Jordan was able to cross-examine Spellman\n\nextensively.     The objection to a single question of doubtful\n\nrelevance did not implicate Jordan’s         constitutional rights.         See\n\nalso Delaware v. Fensterer, 474 U.S. 15, 20 (1985) (per curiam)\n\n(“[T]he   Confrontation    Clause      guarantees    an    opportunity      for\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\feffective     cross-examination,   not   cross-examination   that   is\n\neffective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense\n\nmight wish.”).\n\n     With respect to the Mitchell testimony, the SJC found that the\n\nstatements at issue were not made in Jordan’s presence or conveyed\n\nto him.   Thus, they had no bearing on the voluntariness of Jordan’s\n\nstatements.    The SJC determined that the trial judge did not abuse\n\nhis discretion in striking the testimony, and Jordan has not\n\ndemonstrated that his due process rights were violated.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f",

Though troubled by the facts, the court denied the\n\npetition in a careful and detailed ruling, concluding that while\n\nthere were two plausible versions of the facts, the evidence was\n\nsufficient to affirm the version adopted by the state courts, from\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fwhich one could reasonably conclude that Jordan’s waiver was made\n\nknowingly and voluntarily.\n\n\n\n                              LEGAL STANDARD\n\n     This court reviews a district court’s denial of a petition for\n\nhabeas corpus de novo.       Obershaw v. Lanman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59 (1st\n\nCir. 2006), rehearing denied (1st Cir. July 26, 2006).                  Because\n\nJordan’s   petition    was   filed   after    the   effective   date    of   the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254, the district court was correct in applying that Act.              Under\n\nAEDPA, a federal court can grant habeas relief only where a state\n\ncourt adjudication\n\n           (1) resulted in a decision that was contrary\n           to, or involved an unreasonable application\n           of, clearly established Federal law, as\n           determined by the Supreme Court of the United\n           States; or (2) . . . was based on an\n           unreasonable determination of the facts in\n           light of the evidence presented in the state\n           court proceeding.”\n\n28   U.S.C.   §   2254(d)(1)-(2).            The    state   court’s     factual\n\ndeterminations are entitled to a presumption of correctness, which\n\nmust be rebutted by clear and convincing evidence.                  28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(e)(1); see also Obershaw, 453 F.3d at 59.\n\n                                DISCUSSION\n\n     Jordan’s principal argument is that the Boston detectives were\n\nbound by the proffer letter given by the federal prosecutor.                 The\n\nproffer    agreement   had    been   made     before    Detective      Spellman\n\n                                     -6-\n\fquestioned       Jordan.   Jordan argues that, because states are bound\n\nby federal law, the federal prosecutor’s promise of use immunity is\n\nbinding on the state authorities.             For support, he cites Murphy v.\n\nWaterfront Comm’n, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106864\"><a href=\"/opinion/106864/murphy-v-waterfront-commn-of-ny-harbor/\"><span class=\"volume\">378</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1964).               Murphy held in substance\n\nthat if a witness is given state immunity and compelled to give\n\npotentially incriminating testimony in state proceedings, he must\n\nlikewise    be    immunized   from     use    of   that    testimony   in   federal\n\nproceedings.       Id. at 79.     But Murphy gives no comfort to Jordan.\n\nJordan was not under compulsion to testify in either jurisdiction.\n\nThus his claim of being whipsawed is without substance.                       Even\n\nassuming an argument for extending Murphy could be made in this\n\ncase, the standard of review contained in AEDPA makes this argument\n\nhopeless.\n\n     The second string to Jordan’s bow is his contention that his\n\nstatements to the detectives could not have been found to have been\n\nvoluntarily      made.     That   is   because,      according    to   Jordan,   he\n\nreasonably believed that the assurance from the assistant United\n\nStates attorney that anything he said could not be used against him\n\ncarried over to his interview with the Boston detectives. But here\n\nhis argument runs squarely into AEDPA.              Under AEDPA, habeas relief\n\nis precluded unless the state court adjudication was based on “an\n\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\n\npresented in the State court proceeding.”                 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2).\n\nMoreover, a state court determination of factual issues “shall be\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fpresumed to be correct” unless petitioner rebuts the “presumption\n\nof correctness by clear and convincing evidence.”                  28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(e)(1).      Jordan has offered no evidence that the state\n\ncourt’s   determination   was    unreasonable,      much   less    clear    and\n\nconvincing     evidence   that   the      court’s    factual      finding    of\n\nvoluntariness was incorrect.\n\n     Finally, Jordan contends that he was denied due process when\n\nthe trial court restricted his cross-examination of Detective\n\nSpellman, and struck one of Agent Mitchell’s statements on direct\n\nexamination.\n\n     The SJC held that the trial court’s restriction of Spellman’s\n\ncross examination was not error.        Jordan argues that this holding\n\nis an unreasonable application of Supreme Court law as stated in\n\nWashington v. Texas, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107481\"><a href=\"/opinion/107481/washington-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">388</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1967).

Rather, as the\n\nSJC found, at trial Jordan was able to cross-examine Spellman\n\nextensively.     The objection to a single question of doubtful\n\nrelevance did not implicate Jordan’s         constitutional rights.         See\n\nalso Delaware v. Fensterer, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111535\"><a href=\"/opinion/111535/delaware-v-fensterer/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 20 (1985) (per curiam)\n\n(“[T]he   Confrontation    Clause      guarantees    an    opportunity      for\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\feffective     cross-examination,   not   cross-examination   that   is\n\neffective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense\n\nmight wish.”).\n\n     With respect to the Mitchell testimony, the SJC found that the\n\nstatements at issue were not made in Jordan’s presence or conveyed\n\nto him.   Thus, they had no bearing on the voluntariness of Jordan’s\n\nstatements.    The SJC determined that the trial judge did not abuse\n\nhis discretion in striking the testimony, and Jordan has not\n\ndemonstrated that his due process rights were violated.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f</pre>",
