Joseph A. DiClerico, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     Nathaniel Cooper on brief pro se.\n     Thomas P.

Pro se plaintiff-appellant Nathaniel Cooper\n\n(\"Cooper\") appeals from the dismissal of his complaint against the\n\nUnited States Department of Labor (\"DOL\") for lack of subject\n\nmatter   jurisdiction.        Where      the   question      of       subject    matter\n\njurisdiction focuses on \"pure (or nearly pure) questions of law,\"\n\nwe review the district court's decision de novo.                         Gonzalez v.\n\nUnited States, 284 F.3d 281, 287 (1st Cir. 2002).                  We are obligated\n\nto construe a pro se complaint liberally, Ayala Serrano v. Lebron\n\nGonzalez, 909 F.2d 8, 15 (1st Cir. 1990), treating all well-pleaded\n\nfactual allegations as true and drawing all reasonable inferences\n\nin the plaintiff's favor, Aversa v. United States, 99 F.3d 1200,\n\n1210 (1st Cir. 1996). After carefully reviewing the parties' briefs\n\nand   the   record,   we   affirm        the   dismissal      of      the   complaint\n\nessentially for the reasons stated in the magistrate judge's July\n\n22, 2002 report and recommendation.               We add only the following\n\ncomments.\n\n      As the lower court correctly noted, the Federal Employees'\n\nCompensation   Act    (\"FECA\"),      5   U.S.C.   §   8101    et       seq.,    is   the\n\nexclusive avenue of redress for a federal employee's claim against\n\nthe government for a work-related injury.              See Lockheed Aircraft\n\nCorp. v. United States, 460 U.S. 190, 193-94 (1983).                            We have\n\nrecognized only one exception to FECA's clear mandate prohibiting\n\njudicial    review:   where    the       plaintiff    makes       a    specific      and\n\nsubstantive claim of the deprivation of his constitutional rights.\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fSee Paluca v. Secretary of Labor, 813 F.2d 524, 527 (1st Cir. 1987)\n\n(holding     that   district    courts       have   jurisdiction   to    review\n\nSecretary's compliance with Constitution in its administration of\n\nFECA).     Cooper has made no such claim here.\n\n      A complaint must set forth specific allegations sufficient to\n\nsupport a claim.      See Aulson v. Blanchard, 83 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1996) (noting that \"bald assertions, unsupportable conclusions,\n\nperiphrastic circumlocutions, and the like need not be credited\").\n\nCooper's complaint does not explicitly allege any constitutional\n\nviolation.      Moreover, the complaint lacks any reference to the\n\nUnited States Constitution, and does not invoke any term or phrase\n\ncommonly associated with a constitutional right sufficient to allow\n\nthe court to infer that such a claim was being alleged.\n\n      On appeal, Cooper argues that he did, in fact, assert a due\n\nprocess violation when he alleged that the DOL's Office of Workers'\n\nCompensation Programs (\"OWCP\") tampered with his file \"as a tactic\n\nto intentionally delay the processing of this claim.\"                   Cooper's\n\nallegation, however, is merely a bald assertion that does not pass\n\nmuster as a well-pleaded factual averment. See id. Cooper alleged\n\nno facts to even suggest any improper conduct by the OWCP, let\n\nalone conduct egregious enough to constitute a constitutional\n\nviolation.      Indeed, the only \"evidence\" in support of his claim is\n\na   newspaper    article   on   a   wholly    unrelated   case   involving   an\n\nattorney for the Board of Veterans Affairs who had tampered with\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fveterans' files.\n\n     Cooper     also   tries   on    appeal   to    present      additional\n\nconstitutional    challenges   to   the   OWCP's   denial   of   benefits,\n\ninvoking the Fourth, Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.                 These\n\narguments were not raised below, and, therefore, are deemed waived.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Bongiorno, 106 F.3d 1027, 1034 (1st\n\nCir. 1997) (noting that constitutional arguments not raised in the\n\nlower court cannot be advanced on appeal). Moreover, because these\n\narguments are vague and cryptic, they are waived for this reason as\n\nwell.    See id. (noting that issues raised on appeal in perfunctory\n\nmanner are deemed waived).     Accordingly, the lower court correctly\n\nruled that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over Cooper's\n\nclaims.\n\n        Cooper's motion for expedited review of his appeal is denied\n\nas moot.\n\n     The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f",
