Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n                      Selya, Lipez and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Norman M. Silvia       on    Application       for    a   Certificate   of\nAppealability pro se.\n\n\n\n                             June 10, 2003\n\f     Per       Curiam.   Norman     M.   Silvia     seeks    a   certificate   of\n\nappealability (\"COA\") to appeal from the denial of his petition\n\nfiled pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2254.             Specifically, he seeks a COA\n\nto appeal from the denial of habeas relief on the following\n\nconstitutional grounds: 1) ineffective assistance of trial counsel\n\nfor failure to pursue an insanity defense; 2) abuse of discretion\n\nby the Massachusetts trial court, in violation of petitioner's\n\nSixth Amendment rights, for denying without a hearing his motion to\n\nsubstitute court-appointed counsel; and 3) ineffective assistance\n\nof appellate counsel for failure to assert a claim of ineffective\n\nassistance of trial counsel on petitioner's direct appeal.                     We\n\naddress each claim separately, applying the standard for granting\n\na COA under 28 U.S.C. § 2253(c).\n\nI. The COA Standard\n\n     Because the district court reached the merits of petitioner's\n\nclaims,    a    COA   may   issue   only   if     the   following   standard   is\n\nsatisfied:\n\n     The petitioner must demonstrate that reasonable jurists\n     would find the district court's assessment of the\n     constitutional claims debatable or wrong.\n\nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 484 (2000).                However, because the\n\ndistrict court also denied the habeas petition on the alternative\n\nground of procedural default, a COA may not issue unless petitioner\n\ncan also make the following showings:\n\n     that jurists of reason would find it debatable whether\n     the petition states a valid claim of the denial of a\n\n                                         -2-\n\f      constitutional right and that jurists of reason would\n      find it debatable whether the district court was correct\n      in its procedural ruling.\n\nId.   The Supreme Court has recently reiterated that, at the COA\n\nstage, \"the court of appeals should limit its examination to a\n\nthreshold inquiry into the underlying merit of [a petitioner's]\n\nclaims.\" Miller-El v. Cockrell, __ U.S. __, 123 S.Ct. 1029, 1034\n\n(2003).\n\nII. Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel Claim\n\n      Petitioner claimed that he received ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel   because   his   court-appointed   trial   attorney   failed   to\n\ninvestigate and pursue \"petitioner's only realistic defense:\" that\n\nbecause of a mental impairment he lacked criminal responsibility at\n\nthe time of the offense.        Under Massachusetts law, \"[l]ack of\n\ncriminal responsibility requires the existence of a mental disease\n\nor defect, which causes the defendant to lack the substantial\n\ncapacity either to appreciate the wrongfulness of his or her acts,\n\nor to conform his or her conduct to the requirements of the law.\"\n\nCommonwealth v. Seabrooks, 425 Mass. 507, 515 (1997).\n\n      Applying the federal standard set forth in Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), the district court assessed the\n\nmerits of this claim as follows:\n\n      the record reveals that trial counsel's strategic\n      decision not to pursue a defense of diminished capacity\n      or mental impairment was an informed and reasonable\n      decision.   Trial counsel sought and obtained funds to\n      hire a psychiatric expert to examine the petitioner.\n      That expert met with petitioner several times, reviewed\n\n                                  -3-\n\f      petitioner's medical history, and interviewed other\n      witnesses.     Dr. Meyer concluded that, while the\n      petitioner suffered from a mental disease, he did not\n      lack criminal responsibility.\n           As the United States Court of Appeals for the First\n      Circuit has said, \"[e]ffectiveness does not require that\n      counsel jump through every conceivable hoop or engage in\n      futile exercises.\" United States v. Pellerito, 878 F.2d\n      1535, 1540 (1st Cir. 1985). Petitioner's trial counsel\n      did, in fact, put on a defense, essentially arguing that\n      the petitioner had gone to the victim's house intent on\n      committing suicide. In the circumstances of this case,\n      this was not ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\n      We   conclude   that   reasonable      jurists   could   not   find   the\n\ndistrict court's assessment of this ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claim debatable or wrong. Nothing in the record, including\n\nthe affidavits of witnesses (the victim and petitioner's mother)\n\nwhom petitioner faults his trial counsel for failing to interview,\n\nsupports a finding that petitioner was not criminally responsible\n\nat the time of the offense.      Petitioner suggests that counsel was\n\ndeficient in not obtaining his medical records from psychiatric\n\ncounseling and treatment he had undergone in the years leading up\n\nto the offense.       However, the record reveals that those medical\n\nrecords were among the sources on which defendant's expert relied\n\nas   did   the   psychologist   from    Bridgewater    State   Hospital     who\n\nprepared the Aid to Sentencing Evaluation.             Both reports reached\n\nconclusions about petitioner's psychological health which were\n\nincompatible with a finding that he lacked criminal responsibility.\n\nGiven the dearth of evidence that petitioner had summoned to\n\nsupport such a defense, reasonable jurists could not debate the\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fdistrict court's assessment that trial counsel's failure to pursue\n\nthat defense did not constitute ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nIII.   Sixth   Amendment   Claim   for   Failure   to   Grant   Motion   for\n\nContinuance and Appointment of New Trial Counsel\n\n       Petitioner claimed that the trial court abused its discretion,\n\nin violation of petitioner's Sixth Amendment rights, by \"fail[ing]\n\nto make adequate inquiry into petitioner's complaint that conflict\n\nbetween petitioner and his counsel was so great that it resulted in\n\ntotal lack of communication preventing adequate defense.\" § 2254\n\nPetition. In denying § 2254 relief on procedural default grounds,\n\nthe district court ruled as follows:\n\n            Petitioner's remaining claim, that the trial court\n       abused its discretion by denying petitioner's request for\n       the appointment of new counsel before the trial is also\n       procedurally defaulted.    The Appeals Court determined\n       that petitioner had waived this claim, and reviewed it\n       only to determine whether the denial of the motion for\n       new counsel created a substantial risk of miscarriage of\n       justice.\n            Petitioner has made no showing that would excuse\n       this default.    Although this court could review the\n       defaulted claim if refusing to do so would result in a\n       miscarriage of justice, that risk is not present in this\n       case. The United States Court of Appeals for the First\n       Circuit has called this an exception \"seldom to be used,\n       and explicitly tied to a showing of actual innocence.\"\n       Burks v. DuBois, 55 F.3d 712, 717 (1st Cir. 1995). In\n       this case, petitioner makes no claim of actual innocence,\n       arguing instead that his attorney should have put forth\n       a diminished capacity defense. This is not the type of\n       claim that risks a miscarriage of justice, and the claim\n       is therefore barred from collateral review by this court.\n\n       Reasonable jurists would not find it debatable whether the\n\ndistrict court was correct in this procedural ruling.           \"A finding\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fby a state court that a defendant procedurally defaulted a claim\n\nbars federal    habeas   corpus   relief   on    that   claim   unless    that\n\ndefendant as a petitioner shows either cause for the default and\n\nprejudice from the claimed violation of federal law, or that a\n\nfundamental miscarriage of justice would result if the claim is not\n\nconsidered. Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991).\" Gunter\n\nv. Maloney, 291 F.3d 74, 78 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n     The record reveals that Silvia first raised this claim in his\n\nmotion for a new trial.      The superior court held that the claim\n\n\"could have been raised on appeal but [was] not\" and, therefore,\n\nwas waived. The Appeals Court agreed.           Therefore, federal habeas\n\ncorpus relief     was   barred   unless   Silvia   could   show   cause    and\n\nprejudice.   However, in none of his habeas filings did Silvia even\n\nallege cause to excuse the procedural default of this claim or\n\nprejudice from the claimed Sixth Amendment violation. Nor does the\n\nrecord provide support for such showings. Reasonable jurists could\n\nnot debate the correctness of the district court's ruling that\n\nhabeas relief was precluded by the procedural default of this claim\n\nin state court.\n\nIV. Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel Claim\n\n     In this final habeas claim, petitioner faulted his newly-\n\nappointed appellate counsel for failure to raise an ineffective\n\nassistance of trial counsel claim on direct appeal and for advising\n\nhim that such a claim should be raised, if at all, in a motion for\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fnew trial following the appeal.    In his COA request to this court\n\npetitioner maintains that the ineffective assistance of trial\n\ncounsel claim that he wanted raised was the claim that he and his\n\ntrial attorney \"were embroiled in a[n] irreconcilable conflict\n\nthroughout the entire proceedings.\"       However, the record supports\n\nthe district   court's   assumption     that   the   claim    he   asked   his\n\nattorney to raise on appeal was an ineffective assistance claim\n\nbased on failure to pursue the defense that petitioner was not\n\ncriminally responsible.\n\n     Regardless of which of these ineffective assistance claims\n\npetitioner wanted pursued, his attorney's advice that such a claim\n\nshould properly be raised, if at all, in a motion for new trial was\n\nconsistent with state law. Under Massachusetts law, \"[a] claim of\n\nineffective assistance may be resolved on direct appeal of the\n\ndefendant's conviction when the factual basis of the claim appears\n\nindisputably on the trial record.\" Commonwealth v. Adamides, 37\n\nMass.App.Ct. 339, 344 (1994)(emphasis added).                Here, however,\n\nappellate counsel correctly concluded that the record before the\n\nAppeals Court contained nothing that would support petitioner's\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim.        His advice that a viable\n\nineffective assistance claim would have to be based upon new facts\n\n\"introduced by way of affidavits accompanying a new trial motion\"\n\nwas consistent with applicable state law. See Commonwealth v.\n\nBurgess, 434 Mass. 307, 317 (2001).       Reasonable jurists could not\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fdebate the district court's assessment that petitioner was not\n\nentitled   to   habeas   relief   on   his   ineffective   assistance   of\n\nappellate counsel claim.\n\n     Petitioner's request for a COA is denied and the appeal is\n\nterminated.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",

The superior court held that the claim\n\n\"could have been raised on appeal but [was] not\" and, therefore,\n\nwas waived. The Appeals Court agreed.           Therefore, federal habeas\n\ncorpus relief     was   barred   unless   Silvia   could   show   cause    and\n\nprejudice.   However, in none of his habeas filings did Silvia even\n\nallege cause to excuse the procedural default of this claim or\n\nprejudice from the claimed Sixth Amendment violation. Nor does the\n\nrecord provide support for such showings. Reasonable jurists could\n\nnot debate the correctness of the district court's ruling that\n\nhabeas relief was precluded by the procedural default of this claim\n\nin state court.\n\nIV. Ineffective Assistance of Appellate Counsel Claim\n\n     In this final habeas claim, petitioner faulted his newly-\n\nappointed appellate counsel for failure to raise an ineffective\n\nassistance of trial counsel claim on direct appeal and for advising\n\nhim that such a claim should be raised, if at all, in a motion for\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fnew trial following the appeal.    In his COA request to this court\n\npetitioner maintains that the ineffective assistance of trial\n\ncounsel claim that he wanted raised was the claim that he and his\n\ntrial attorney \"were embroiled in a[n] irreconcilable conflict\n\nthroughout the entire proceedings.\"       However, the record supports\n\nthe district   court's   assumption     that   the   claim    he   asked   his\n\nattorney to raise on appeal was an ineffective assistance claim\n\nbased on failure to pursue the defense that petitioner was not\n\ncriminally responsible.\n\n     Regardless of which of these ineffective assistance claims\n\npetitioner wanted pursued, his attorney's advice that such a claim\n\nshould properly be raised, if at all, in a motion for new trial was\n\nconsistent with state law. Under Massachusetts law, \"[a] claim of\n\nineffective assistance may be resolved on direct appeal of the\n\ndefendant's conviction when the factual basis of the claim appears\n\nindisputably on the trial record.\" Commonwealth v. Adamides, 37\n\nMass.App.Ct. 339, 344 (1994)(emphasis added).                Here, however,\n\nappellate counsel correctly concluded that the record before the\n\nAppeals Court contained nothing that would support petitioner's\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim.        His advice that a viable\n\nineffective assistance claim would have to be based upon new facts\n\n\"introduced by way of affidavits accompanying a new trial motion\"\n\nwas consistent with applicable state law.
