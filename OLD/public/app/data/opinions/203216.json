Francisco A. Besosa, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                   Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     A.J. Amadeo Murga for appellant.\n\n     Andrés W. López for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          March 28, 2008\n\f          LYNCH,   Circuit   Judge.    This   is    an   appeal   from    the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of plaintiff's complaint for lack of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction.\n\n          The complaint was brought by Alberto San, Inc., an owner\n\nof a substantial interest in an office condominium, against the\n\nboard and other owners of the condominium.         The complaint alleged\n\nthat a Puerto Rico statute, which decreased plaintiff's original\n\nvoting power in the condominium association, violated plaintiff's\n\ndue process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the\n\nUnited States Constitution.\n\n          The change in voting rights initially resulted from the\n\nenactment of Law 157 in 1976, which abrogated Law 104, on which\n\nplaintiff's claim is based.      Under Law 104, voting rights were\n\nassigned by percentage of ownership; Law 157 assigns one vote to\n\neach owner regardless of the owner's share in the condominium.\n\nFurther, a statute enacted on July 7, 2003, repeated the relevant\n\nterms of the 1976 statute.     Plaintiff filed suit on December 6,\n\n2006, after an April 30, 2004 majority vote of the condominium\n\nassociation rejected plaintiff's position that a reserve hurricane\n\nfund was no longer needed (because insurance had been purchased)\n\nand should thus be distributed. Plaintiff alleges that if the fund\n\nwere distributed, it would be entitled to receive $250,000.              This\n\nis based on plaintiff's assertion that most of the present owners\n\nnever contributed to the fund.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f           Plaintiff's federal court complaint seeks damages of\n\n$500,000, an injunction against the defendants precluding them from\n\nrelying on specific provisions of Puerto Rico law, a declaration\n\nthat the 1976 and 2003 statutes are unconstitutional, and an\n\ninjunction against the condominium association preventing it from\n\nspending funds to defend this case.        The complaint sought relief\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201.         The complaint also\n\nsought relief for unjust enrichment, presumably under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw.\n\n           On   February   21,   2007,   plaintiff   moved   for   summary\n\njudgment on its claims.    In its summary judgment papers, plaintiff\n\nagain argued that the 1976 statute was unconstitutional under the\n\nDue Process Clause.    Jurisdiction was asserted under 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1331, which confers federal jurisdiction over \"all civil actions\n\narising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United\n\nStates.\"\n\n           Defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction on March 2, 2007.       Defendants argued that the only\n\nbasis alleged for a federal claim was a § 1983 action, which must\n\nfail because there was no state action.\n\n           In its opposition to the motion to dismiss, plaintiff\n\nargued that the constitutional due process claim based on the\n\nstatute was by itself sufficient to invoke federal jurisdiction\n\nunder § 1331.   As for the § 1983 claim, plaintiff conceded that \"we\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\fhave no state actor\" but argued that § 1983 still applies when\n\nprivate parties \"act[] pursuant to an unconstitutional statute and\n\nwere present [sic] other conditions.\"\n\n               In an unpublished decision, the district court held that\n\nthere was no subject matter jurisdiction under § 1331.            The court\n\nbased       that   jurisdictional   ruling   on   its   determination   that\n\nplaintiff had not alleged sufficient facts to establish \"state\n\naction\" under § 1983, which provides a remedy for deprivations of\n\nfederal rights under color of state law.1                Thus, without an\n\nindependent cause of action, § 1331 was insufficient to confer\n\nfederal jurisdiction.        Although the court's decision referenced\n\nboth Rule 12(b)(1) (lack of subject matter jurisdiction) and Rule\n\n12(b)(6) (failure to state a claim), it entered a dismissal for\n\nlack of jurisdiction, and did so without prejudice.             See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 12(b)(1), (6).        While the outcome on appeal is the same,\n\nthere are distinctions that should be observed between failure to\n\nstate a claim and lack of jurisdiction.           We explain.\n\n               \"Almost by definition, a claim under § 1983 arises under\n\nfederal law and will support federal-question jurisdiction [under\n\n§ 1331] . . . .\"         Local Union No. 12004, United Steelworkers v.\n\nMassachusetts, 377 F.3d 64, 75 (1st Cir. 2004).                 We would be\n\n\n\n        1\n          Section 1983's requirement of action \"under color of\nstate law\" is identical to the \"state action\" requirement of the\nFourteenth Amendment. Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922,\n929 (1982).\n\n                                      -4-\n\freluctant to say these § 1983 and state action questions are so\n\nclearly lacking as to make the federal question insubstantial for\n\njurisdictional purposes.    See Penobscot Nation v. Georgia-Pacific\n\nCorp., 254 F.3d 317, 322 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"[T]he Supreme Court has\n\noften said that a colorable claim of a federal cause of action will\n\nconfer subject matter jurisdiction even though the claim itself may\n\nfail as a matter of law on further examination.\").   Therefore, the\n\ncomplaint should not have been dismissed on jurisdictional grounds.\n\nSee Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 89\n\n(1998); 13B Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 3563,\n\nat 49 (2d ed. 1984).\n\n          Whether plaintiff adequately pleaded state action for\n\npurposes of stating a claim under § 1983 is a different question,\n\nand one that we reach.2    That question was adequately presented to\n\nthe district court and briefed by the parties, so there is no lack\n\nof notice or unfairness in our reaching it.\n\n          The district court found no state action because of the\n\nlack of any joint participation by state officials in private\n\n\n\n     2\n          In its opposition to the motion to dismiss in the\ndistrict court, the plaintiff for the first time made a single\nreference to the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution, art. I,\n§ 10, with no argument presented. The district court opinion was\ndevoted to the § 1983 state action question and noted that\nplaintiff had failed to identify any other basis for federal\njurisdiction.\n          We reject plaintiff's attempts on appeal to shift its\nfocus to a Contract Clause analysis under § 1331.      The argument\nwas waived in the district court and we will not entertain it here.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fdefendants' conduct.       Plaintiff argues that it has sufficiently\n\npleaded state action by alleging that the defendants were acting\n\npursuant to an unconstitutional state statute.\n\n           The state action requirement has two components: \"First,\n\nthe deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or\n\nprivilege created by the State or by a rule of conduct imposed by\n\nthe state . . . .    Second, the party charged with the deprivation\n\nmust be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor.\"\n\nLugar v. Edmondson Oil Co., 457 U.S. 922, 937 (1982).\n\n           A complaint satisfies the first component where, as here,\n\nit alleges that defendants were acting pursuant to a state statute\n\nthat deprived plaintiff of its rights (here, diluting plaintiff's\n\nproperty interests by creating greater voting rights in others).\n\nSee id. at 941; Estades-Negroni v. CPC Hosp. San Juan Capestrano,\n\n412 F.3d 1, 4 n.10 (1st Cir. 2005).       However, satisfaction of that\n\nfirst component is not sufficient in itself to satisfy the state\n\naction requirement.        If it were, \"private parties could face\n\nconstitutional litigation whenever they s[ought] to rely on some\n\nstate   rule   governing    their   interactions   with   the   community\n\nsurrounding them.\"    Lugar, 457 U.S. at 937.\n\n           Turning, as we must, to the second component of the state\n\naction inquiry, a private party can be fairly characterized as a\n\nstate actor if the circumstances of the case meet one of three\n\ntests: the public function test, the joint action/nexus test, or\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fthe state compulsion test.           Estades-Negroni, 412 F.3d at 5.                  The\n\nfirst is clearly not applicable here, as defendants in managing\n\ntheir    condominium    association       were    not     performing        \"a     public\n\nfunction that has been 'traditionally the exclusive prerogative of\n\nthe State.'\"       Id. (quoting Blum v. Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1005\n\n(1982)).\n\n            The    second     test   applies     where        private    citizens     are\n\n\"participant[s] in joint activity with the State or its agents.\"\n\nLugar, 457 U.S. at 941 (quoting Adickes v. S.H. Kress & Co., 398\n\nU.S. 144, 152 (1970)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                             The\n\ndistrict court correctly ruled that no such joint participation was\n\nalleged here.       Cf. id. at 939 n.21 (disagreeing that \"a private\n\nparty's mere invocation of state legal procedures constitutes\n\n'joint participation'\").         Even if a statute is unconstitutional,\n\nprivate    actions    taken    pursuant    to    such     a     statute    may     remain\n\nprivate.    Spencer v. Lee, 864 F.2d 1376, 1381 (7th Cir. 1989).\n\n            Finally, the state compulsion test considers whether \"the\n\nstate     'has    exercised    coercive      power       or     has     provided     such\n\nsignificant      encouragement,      either      overt    or     covert,     that     the\n\n[challenged conduct] must in law be deemed to be that of the\n\nState.'\" Estades-Negroni, 412 F.3d at 5 (quoting Blum, 457 U.S. at\n\n1004).     There is no such coercion or significant encouragement\n\nhere.    In the end, all plaintiff can point to is the existence of\n\na statute, but that alone is not enough.                 Wojcik v. Town of North\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fSmithfield, 874 F. Supp. 508, 517 (D.R.I. 1995) (\"Action by a\n\nprivate party in compliance with a statute is not sufficient to\n\njustify a characterization of that party as a 'state actor.'\").\n\n              If the mere existence of a statute were sufficient to\n\nsatisfy the second component of the state action inquiry, that\n\ncomponent would merge into the first, but the Supreme Court has\n\nnoted that these components are distinct and do not merge when the\n\ndefendants are private citizens.          See Lugar, 457 U.S. at 937.\n\nRather, \"something more\" is required to establish that a private\n\nentity should be considered a state actor.           Id. at 939.    Since\n\nnothing more was or could be alleged here, the district court was\n\ncorrect that plaintiff failed to state a claim under § 1983.\n\n              With the § 1983 claim set aside, plaintiff is left\n\nwithout   a    federal   case.   Alleging   a   constitutional   wrong   is\n\ninsufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion unless plaintiff can\n\npoint to another federal statute or the existence of a federal\n\ncommon law cause of action.      See Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko, 534\n\nU.S. 61, 68 (2001) (noting Court's unwillingness to recognize any\n\nadditional common law causes of action for constitutional torts).\n\nSection 1331 extends federal jurisdiction to \"those [cases] in\n\nwhich federal law creates the cause of action,\" Merrell Dow Pharms.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fInc. v. Thompson, 478 U.S. 804, 809 (1986);3 it does not itself\n\nprovide relief.\n\n           The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, gets\n\nplaintiff no further.      That Act merely \"makes available an added\n\nanodyne   for   disputes    that   come   within   the    federal   courts'\n\njurisdiction on some other basis.\"          Ernst & Young v. Depositors\n\nEcon. Prot. Corp., 45 F.3d 530, 534 (1st Cir. 1995); see also\n\nSkelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co., 339 U.S. 667, 671 (1950);\n\nProgressive Consumers Fed. Credit Union v. United States, 79 F.3d\n\n1228, 1230 (1st Cir. 1996); McCarthy v. Marshall, 723 F.2d 1034,\n\n1037 (1st Cir. 1983).      Thus \"[t]here must be an independent basis\n\nof jurisdiction . . . before a federal court may entertain a\n\ndeclaratory-judgment    action.\"      10B    Wright   &   Miller,   Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure § 2766, at 644 (3d ed. 1998).          Section 2201\n\nis the cart; plaintiff still needs a horse.\n\n           Plaintiff does not allege that the defendants could have\n\nbrought a claim raising a federal question, which would allow in\n\nturn the use of § 2201 to establish a federal defense, see id.\n\n§ 2767, at 655 -- nor could it.       The Due Process Clause protects\n\nproperty from wrongful deprivation by public actors, not private;\n\nthe closest public action here is the statute's enactment, and the\n\n\n     3\n          There is a limited exception extending § 1331 coverage to\nstate law claims involving \"contested\" and \"substantial\" federal\nissues that implicate \"serious federal interest[s].\" Grable & Sons\nMetal Prods., Inc. v. Darue Eng'g & Mfg., 545 U.S. 308, 313 (2005).\nThat exception is exceedingly rare and clearly not applicable here.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fconstitutionality of that statute is only tangentially related to\n\nplaintiff's real complaint.           In a properly instituted state court\n\naction,   this    question     of   constitutionality      would   arise     as    a\n\npotential defense, if at all.          Cf. Skelly Oil Co., 339 U.S. at 672-\n\n74   (artful     pleading    anticipating       a   federal   defense   is     not\n\nsufficient to invoke federal jurisdiction under the Declaratory\n\nJudgment Act).\n\n           Given the congressional intent to limit § 1983 claims\n\nbrought under federal question jurisdiction to situations of state\n\naction, it would not be appropriate to grant such relief in this\n\ncase. As the district court noted and we have discussed, plaintiff\n\nhas not alleged any other viable premise on which to bring its\n\nsuit. The suit was thus an appropriate candidate for dismissal for\n\nfailure to state a claim.\n\n           Plaintiff also appeals from the district court's award of\n\nattorneys' fees to defendants.                Plaintiff's complaint, though\n\nunsuccessful, was not so \"frivolous, unreasonable, or without\n\nfoundation\"      as   to    warrant    an   award    of   attorneys'    fees      to\n\ndefendants.      Tang v. R.I. Dep't of Elderly Affairs, 163 F.3d 7, 13\n\n(1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Christianburg Garment Co. v. EEOC, 434\n\nU.S. 412, 421 (1978)).        Accordingly, we vacate the fee award.\n\n           We thus remand with instructions to revise the judgment\n\nto dismiss the federal claim with prejudice, to dismiss without\n\n\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\fprejudice the Puerto Rico law claim for unjust enrichment, and to\n\ndeny the defendants' motion for award of attorneys' fees.\n\n          Costs are awarded to the defendants.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -11-\n\f",

Further, a statute enacted on July 7, 2003, repeated the relevant terms of the 1976 statute. Plaintiff filed suit on December 6, 2006, after an April 30, 2004 majority vote of the condominium association rejected plaintiffs position that a reserve hurricane fund was no longer needed (because insurance had been purchased) and should thus be distributed. Plaintiff alleges that if the fund were distributed, it would be entitled to receive $250,000.

The complaint sought relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201. The complaint also sought relief for unjust enrichment, presumably under Puerto Rico law.</p>\n<p>On February 21, 2007, plaintiff moved for summary judgment on its claims. In its summary judgment papers, plaintiff again argued that the 1976 statute was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause.

The court based that jurisdictional ruling on its determination that plaintiff had not alleged sufficient facts to establish \"state action\" under § 1983, which provides a remedy for deprivations of federal rights under color of state law.<sup>[1]</sup> Thus, without an independent cause of action, § 1331 was insufficient to confer federal jurisdiction. Although the court's decision referenced both Rule 12(b)(1) (lack of subject matter jurisdiction) and Rule 12(b)(6) (failure to state a claim), it entered a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, and did so without prejudice. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), (6). While the outcome on appeal is the same, there are distinctions that should be observed between failure to state a claim and lack of jurisdiction.

Citizens for a Better Env't,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 89, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998); 13B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 3563, at 49 (2d ed.1984).</p>\n<p>Whether plaintiff adequately pleaded state action for purposes of stating a claim under § 1983 is a different question, and one that we reach.<sup>[2]</sup> That question was adequately presented to the district court and briefed by the parties, so there is no lack of notice or unfairness in our reaching it.</p>\n<p>The district court found no state action because of the lack of any joint participation by state officials in private defendants' conduct. Plaintiff argues that it has sufficiently pleaded state action by alleging <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> that the defendants were acting pursuant to an unconstitutional state statute.</p>\n<p>The state action requirement has two components: \"First, the deprivation must be caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State or by a rule of conduct imposed by the state. . . . Second, the party charged with the deprivation must be a person who may fairly be said to be a state actor.\" <i>Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co.,</i> 457 U.S. 922, 937, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982).</p>\n<p>A complaint satisfies the first component where, as here, it alleges that defendants were acting pursuant to a state statute that deprived plaintiff of its rights (here, diluting plaintiffs property interests by creating greater voting rights in others). <i>See id.</i> at 941, 102 S.Ct. 2744; <i>Estades-Negroni v. CPC Hosp. San Juan Capestrano,</i> 412 F.3d 1, 4 n. 10 (1st Cir.2005). However, satisfaction of that first component is not sufficient in itself to satisfy the state action requirement. If it were, \"private parties could face constitutional litigation whenever they s[ought] to rely on some state rule governing their interactions with the community surrounding them.\" <i>Lugar,</i> 457 U.S. at 937, 102 S.Ct. 2744.</p>\n<p>Turning, as we must, to the second component of the state action inquiry, a private party can be fairly characterized as a state actor if the circumstances of the case meet one of three tests: the public function test, the joint action/nexus test, or the state compulsion test. <i>Estades-Negroni,</i> 412 F.3d at 5. The first is clearly not applicable here, as defendants in managing their condominium association were not performing \"a public function that has been `traditionally the exclusive prerogative of the State.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Blum v. Yaretsky,</i> 457 U.S. 991, 1005, 102 S.Ct. 2777, 73 L.Ed.2d 534 (1982)).</p>\n<p>The second test applies where private citizens are \"participant[s] in joint activity with the State or its agents.\" <i>Lugar,</i> 457 U.S. at 941, 102 S.Ct. 2744 (quoting <i>Adickes v. S.H. Kress &amp; Co.,</i> 398 U.S. 144, 152, 90 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The district court correctly ruled that no such joint participation was alleged here. <i>Cf. id.</i> at 939 n. 21, 102 S.Ct. 2744 (disagreeing that \"a private party's mere invocation of state legal procedures constitutes `joint participation'\"). Even if a statute is unconstitutional, private actions taken pursuant to such a statute may remain private. <i>Spencer v. Lee,</i> 864 F.2d 1376, 1381 (7th Cir.1989).</p>\n<p>Finally, the state compulsion test considers whether \"the state `has exercised coercive power or has provided such significant encouragement, either overt or covert, that the [challenged conduct] must in law be deemed to be that of the State.'\" <i>Estades-Negroni</i> 412 F.3d at 5 (quoting Blum, 457 U.S. at 1004, 102 S.Ct. 2777). There is no such coercion or significant encouragement here. In the end, all plaintiff can point to is the existence of a statute, but that alone is not enough. <i>Wojcik v. Town of North Smithfield,</i> 874 F.Supp. 508, 517 (D.R.I.1995) (\"Action by a private party in compliance with a statute is not sufficient to justify a characterization of that party as a `state actor.'\").</p>\n<p>If the mere existence of a statute were sufficient to satisfy the second component of the state action inquiry, that component would merge into the first, but the Supreme Court has noted that these components are distinct and do not merge when the defendants are private citizens. <i>See </i><i>Lugar,</i> 457 U.S. at 937, 102 S.Ct. 2744. Rather, \"something more\" is required to establish that a private entity should be considered a state actor. <i>Id.</i> at 939, 102 S.Ct. 2744. Since nothing more was or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> could be alleged here, the district court was correct that plaintiff failed to state a claim under § 1983.</p>\n<p>With the § 1983 claim set aside, plaintiff is left without a federal case. Alleging a constitutional wrong is insufficient to survive a Rule 12(b)(6) motion unless plaintiff can point to another federal statute or the existence of a federal common law cause of action. <i>See </i><i>Corr. Servs. Corp. v. Malesko,</i> 534 U.S. 61, 68, 122 S.Ct. 515, 151 L.Ed.2d 456 (2001) (noting Court's unwillingness to recognize any additional common law causes of action for constitutional torts). Section 1331 extends federal jurisdiction to \"those [cases] in which federal law creates the cause of action,\" <i>Merrell Dow Pharms. Inc. v. Thompson,</i> 478 U.S. 804, 809, 106 S.Ct. 3229, 92 L.Ed.2d 650 (1986);<sup>[3]</sup> it does not itself provide relief.</p>\n<p>The Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. § 2201, gets plaintiff no further. That Act merely \"makes available an added anodyne for disputes that come within the federal courts' jurisdiction on some other basis.\" <i>Ernst &amp; Young v. Depositors Econ. Prot. Corp.,</i> 45 F.3d 530, 534 (1st Cir.1995); <i>see also </i><i>Shelly Oil Co. v. Phillips Petroleum Co.,</i> 339 U.S. 667, 671, 70 S.Ct 876, 94 L.Ed. 1194 (1950); <i>Progressive Consumers Fed. Credit Union v. United States,</i> 79 F.3d 1228, 1230 (1st Cir.1996); <i>McCarthy v. Marshall,</i> 723 F.2d 1034, 1037 (1st Cir.1983). Thus \"[t]here must be an independent basis of jurisdiction . . . before a federal court may entertain a declaratory-judgment action.\" 10B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 2766, at 644 (3d ed.1998). Section 2201 is the cart; plaintiff still needs a horse.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff does not allege that the defendants could have brought a claim raising a federal question, which would allow in turn the use of § 2201 to establish a federal defense, <i>see id.</i> § 2767, at 655  nor could it. The Due Process Clause protects property from wrongful deprivation by public actors, not private; the closest public action here is the statute's enactment, and the constitutionality of that statute is only tangentially related to plaintiffs real complaint. In a properly instituted state court action, this question of constitutionality would arise as a potential defense, if at all. <i>Cf. Skelly Oil Co.,</i> 339 U.S. at 672-74, 70 S.Ct. 876 (artful pleading anticipating a federal defense is not sufficient to invoke federal jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act).</p>\n<p>Given the congressional intent to limit § 1983 claims brought under federal question jurisdiction to situations of state action, it would not be appropriate to grant such relief in this case. As the district court noted and we have discussed, plaintiff has not alleged any other viable premise on which to bring its suit. The suit was thus an appropriate candidate for dismissal for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff also appeals from the district court's award of attorneys' fees to defendants. Plaintiffs complaint, though unsuccessful, was not so \"frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation\" as to warrant an award of attorneys' fees to defendants. <i>Tang v. R.I. Dep't of Elderly Affairs,</i> 163 F.3d 7, 13 (1st Cir.1998) (quoting <i>Christiansburg Garment Co. v. EEOC,</i> 434 U.S. 412, 421, 98 S.Ct. 694, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> 54 L.Ed.2d 648 (1978)). Accordingly, we vacate the fee award.</p>\n<p>We thus remand with instructions to revise the judgment to dismiss the federal claim with prejudice, to dismiss without prejudice the Puerto Rico law claim for unjust enrichment, and to deny the defendants' motion for award of attorneys' fees.</p>\n<p>Costs are awarded to the defendants.</p>\n<p>So ordered.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Section 1983's requirement of action \"under color of state law\" is identical to the \"state action\" requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Lugar v. Edmondson Oil Co.,</i> 457 U.S. 922, 929, 102 S.Ct. 2744, 73 L.Ed.2d 482 (1982).</p>\n<p>[2]  In its opposition to the motion to dismiss in the district court, the plaintiff for the first time made a single reference to the Contract Clause of the U.S. Constitution, art. I, § 10, with no argument presented. The district court opinion was devoted to the § 1983 state action question and noted that plaintiff had failed to identify any other basis for federal jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p>We reject plaintiff's attempts on appeal to shift its focus to a Contract Clause analysis under § 1331. The argument was waived in the district court and we will not entertain it here.</p>\n<p>[3]  There is a limited exception extending § 1331 coverage to state law claims involving \"contested\" and \"substantial\" federal issues that implicate \"serious federal interest[s].\" <i>Grable &amp; Sons Metal Prods., Inc. v. Darue Eng'g &amp; Mfg.,</i> 545 U.S. 308, 313, 125 S.Ct. 2363, 162 L.Ed.2d 257 (2005). That exception is exceedingly rare and clearly not applicable here.</p>\n\n</div>",

Amadeo Murga, for appellant.</p>\n<p>Andrés W. López, for appellees.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge, SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge, and LYNCH, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>LYNCH, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>This is an appeal from the district court's dismissal of plaintiffs complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.</p>\n<p>The complaint was brought by Alberto San, Inc., an owner of a substantial interest in an office condominium, against the board and other owners of the condominium. The complaint alleged that a Puerto Rico statute, which decreased plaintiffs original voting power in the condominium association, violated plaintiffs due process rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p>The change in voting rights initially resulted from the enactment of Law 157 in 1976, which, abrogated Law 104, on which plaintiffs claim is based. Under Law 104, voting rights were assigned by percentage of ownership; Law 157 assigns one vote to each owner regardless of the owner's share in the condominium. Further, a statute enacted on July 7, 2003, repeated the relevant terms of the 1976 statute. Plaintiff filed suit on December 6, 2006, after an April 30, 2004 majority vote of the condominium association rejected plaintiffs position that a reserve hurricane fund was no longer needed (because insurance had been purchased) and should thus be distributed. Plaintiff alleges that if the fund were distributed, it would be entitled to receive $250,000. This is based on plaintiffs, assertion that most of the present owners never contributed to the fund.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs federal court complaint seeks damages of $500,000, an injunction against the defendants precluding them from relying on specific provisions of Puerto Rico law, a declaration that the 1976 and 2003 statutes are unconstitutional, and an injunction against the condominium association preventing it from spending funds to defend this case. The complaint sought relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. § 2201. The complaint also sought relief for unjust enrichment, presumably under Puerto Rico law.</p>\n<p>On February 21, 2007, plaintiff moved for summary judgment on its claims. In its summary judgment papers, plaintiff again argued that the 1976 statute was unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause. Jurisdiction was asserted under 28 U.S.C. § 1331, which confers federal jurisdiction over \"all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.\"</p>\n<p>Defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on March 2, 2007. Defendants argued that the only basis alleged for a federal claim was a <span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> § 1983 action, which must fail because there was no state action.</p>\n<p>In its opposition to the motion to dismiss, plaintiff argued that the constitutional due process claim based on the statute was by itself sufficient to invoke federal jurisdiction under § 1331. As for the § 1983 claim, plaintiff conceded that \"we have no state actor\" but argued that § 1983 still applies when private parties \"act[] pursuant to an unconstitutional statute and were present [sic] other conditions.\"</p>\n<p>In an unpublished decision, the district court held that there was no subject matter jurisdiction under § 1331. The court based that jurisdictional ruling on its determination that plaintiff had not alleged sufficient facts to establish \"state action\" under § 1983, which provides a remedy for deprivations of federal rights under color of state law.<sup>[1]</sup> Thus, without an independent cause of action, § 1331 was insufficient to confer federal jurisdiction. Although the court's decision referenced both Rule 12(b)(1) (lack of subject matter jurisdiction) and Rule 12(b)(6) (failure to state a claim), it entered a dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, and did so without prejudice. See Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(1), (6). While the outcome on appeal is the same, there are distinctions that should be observed between failure to state a claim and lack of jurisdiction. We explain.</p>\n<p>\"Almost by definition, a claim under § 1983 arises under federal law and will support federal-question jurisdiction [under § 1331]. . . .\" <i>Local Union No. 12004, United Steelworkers v.

Thus \"[t]here must be an independent basis of jurisdiction . . . before a federal court may entertain a declaratory-judgment action.\" 10B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay Kane, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 2766, at 644 (3d ed.1998). Section 2201 is the cart; plaintiff still needs a horse.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff does not allege that the defendants could have brought a claim raising a federal question, which would allow in turn the use of § 2201 to establish a federal defense, <i>see id.</i> § 2767, at 655  nor could it. The Due Process Clause protects property from wrongful deprivation by public actors, not private; the closest public action here is the statute's enactment, and the constitutionality of that statute is only tangentially related to plaintiffs real complaint. In a properly instituted state court action, this question of constitutionality would arise as a potential defense, if at all. <i>Cf. Skelly Oil Co.,</i> 339 U.S. at 672-74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104808\"><a href=\"/opinion/104808/skelly-oil-co-v-phillips-petroleum-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">70</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">876</span></a></span> (artful pleading anticipating a federal defense is not sufficient to invoke federal jurisdiction under the Declaratory Judgment Act).</p>\n<p>Given the congressional intent to limit § 1983 claims brought under federal question jurisdiction to situations of state action, it would not be appropriate to grant such relief in this case. As the district court noted and we have discussed, plaintiff has not alleged any other viable premise on which to bring its suit. The suit was thus an appropriate candidate for dismissal for failure to state a claim.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff also appeals from the district court's award of attorneys' fees to defendants. Plaintiffs complaint, though unsuccessful, was not so \"frivolous, unreasonable, or without foundation\" as to warrant an award of attorneys' fees to defendants. <i>Tang v. R.I.

Accordingly, we vacate the fee award.</p>\n<p>We thus remand with instructions to revise the judgment to dismiss the federal claim with prejudice, to dismiss without prejudice the Puerto Rico law claim for unjust enrichment, and to deny the defendants' motion for award of attorneys' fees.</p>\n<p>Costs are awarded to the defendants.</p>\n<p>So ordered.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Section 1983's requirement of action \"under color of state law\" is identical to the \"state action\" requirement of the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Lugar v.

The argument was waived in the district court and we will not entertain it here.</p>\n<p>[3]  There is a limited exception extending § 1331 coverage to state law claims involving \"contested\" and \"substantial\" federal issues that implicate \"serious federal interest[s].\" <i>Grable &amp; Sons Metal Prods., Inc. v.
