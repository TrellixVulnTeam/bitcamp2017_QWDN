Defendant-appellee Andrew Ghalashahi was\n\nconvicted of conspiracy to commit extortion, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. §§ 371 and 875(d); extortion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. §\n\n875(d); and receiving proceeds of extortion, in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 880. He appeals from that conviction, contending that the\n\ndistrict court erred when it reserved its ruling on his motion for\n\njudgment    of   acquittal     under    Fed.      R.   Crim.    P.    29   after   the\n\ngovernment's case-in-chief, and thereafter denied both his original\n\nand renewed motions for judgment of acquittal after the close of\n\nall evidence.     We find his arguments unavailing and affirm.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\n            In   the   early   morning       hours     of   June     29,   2002,   Kurt\n\nEngelhardt and Melissa Harbour met at a house party hosted by\n\nHarbour's    friend,    Ava    Weldon,       in   Manchester,        New   Hampshire.\n\nHarbour was highly intoxicated throughout the night--Engelhardt\n\nobserved her falling down three or four times, twice falling to the\n\nground.     According to Engelhardt's testimony at trial, they left\n\nthe party at approximately 6:30 a.m.              After conversing over coffee\n\nat a local restaurant, Harbour invited Engelhardt back to her home.\n\nUpon arrival, she gave him a tour of the home and spoke about her\n\ntwo year-old son. Again according to Engelhardt's trial testimony,\n\nthe   two   proceeded   upstairs       and    thereafter       engaged     in   sexual\n\nintercourse with a condom provided by Harbour.                       Within a short\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\ftime, Engelhardt left the Harbour residence.         He neither asked for\n\nHarbour's telephone number nor gave his number to Harbour.\n\n           Kathryn Burton, a friend of Harbour's who had also\n\nattended the house party, left the Weldon home at approximately 7\n\na.m. She went to Harbour's apartment, went into the second bedroom\n\nacross the hall from Harbour's bedroom, and fell asleep. At trial,\n\nshe testified that Harbour entered the room later in the morning\n\nand was    laughing.   Burton   eventually    left    Harbour's   home   at\n\napproximately 11 a.m. that same day. Before departing, she entered\n\nHarbour's bedroom and observing her sleeping, unsuccessfully tried\n\nto wake her.\n\n           Later that afternoon, Harbour and Weldon got together\n\nagain and went shopping at a local mall.        They then went country\n\nline dancing at a bar in Methuen, Massachusetts.        They returned to\n\nManchester later in the evening, where they visited a couple of\n\nbars through the night, and then had breakfast together in the\n\nearly hours of the morning.\n\n           Weldon testified that, a few days later at Harbour's\n\nrequest,   she   obtained   Engelhardt's     phone    number   from   John\n\nSchiavone, a friend of Engelhardt's, and gave it to Harbour.\n\nWeldon also testified that Ghalashahi and Harbour had been engaged\n\nin a romantic relationship at some point.\n\n           A few days later on July 2, Engelhardt received a number\n\nof voice mail messages in which Ghalashahi, through a computerized\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fvoice, repeated, \"We know what you did.            We're going to the police.\n\nYou have to pick up the phone.            You're a jerk.\"      The following\n\nmorning, Ghalashahi called again and Engelhardt spoke to him for\n\nthe first time. He assumed that the caller was Harbour's boyfriend\n\nand apologized to the caller while explaining that Harbour had told\n\nhim that she did not have a boyfriend.          Ghalashahi told Engelhardt\n\nthat he and Harbour were just friends and then asked Engelhardt to\n\nexplain what happened between him and Harbour.             Engelhardt in turn\n\ntold   Ghalashahi     that   he   and    Harbour    had   engaged   in   sexual\n\nintercourse. Ghalashahi expressed surprise because Harbour had not\n\ntold him that she and Engelhardt had had sex.\n\n           Ghalashahi then told Engelhardt that he had a friend who\n\nhad gone to prison for sexually touching a girl and that Harbour\n\nwas going to report him to the police for rape unless Engelhardt\n\npaid her $5,000.      Later that same day, Engelhardt received another\n\nphone call from Ghalashahi, who this time demanded $50,000 and told\n\nEngelhardt to meet him at a store in Manchester, New Hampshire at\n\napproximately 5:00 p.m. that day.\n\n           At   the    meeting,    Engelhardt       and   Ghalashahi     sat   in\n\nEngelhardt's car.       Ghalashahi identified himself as \"Drew.\"               He\n\ngave Engelhardt a handwritten list of demands, which included a\n\ndemand for a written apology, a sexually transmitted disease test,\n\nand $150,000.       The list gave Engelhardt credit for the $5,000\n\ndemanded earlier in the day, even though at that point it had not\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fbeen paid, and listed an outstanding balance of $145,000.        In\n\nconversation, Ghalashahi told Engelhardt that Harbour had demanded\n\n$300,000, but that he had talked her down to $150,000.   At the end\n\nof the meeting, Engelhardt gave Ghalashahi $5,000. Ghalashahi then\n\ntold Engelhardt that he was going to meet with Harbour, who he said\n\nwas waiting nearby in Ghalashahi's car.\n\n          Between July 3 and July 22, 2002, Ghalashahi called\n\nEngelhardt at least once per day to ask about the money demanded,\n\non some occasions calling several times a day.         On July 22,\n\nEngelhardt contacted the FBI.\n\n          While Engelhardt was describing the events of the past\n\nthree weeks to the FBI, he received a phone call from Ghalashahi.\n\nWith Engelhardt's consent, the FBI recorded the conversation.    At\n\nthe FBI's direction, Engelhardt set up a meeting with Ghalashahi\n\nfor July 23, 2002, mentioning to Ghalashahi that he might not have\n\nall the money by this time.\n\n          Later on July 23, the FBI, again with Engelhardt's\n\nconsent, recorded another phone conversation with Ghalashahi during\n\nwhich Ghalashahi admonished Engelhardt for mentioning the meeting\n\nlocation on the telephone.    Ghalashahi spoke in code, referring to\n\nthe purpose of the meeting as relating to a car purchase and\n\npayment by cashier's check.\n\n          On July 24, 2002, Ghalashahi was charged with one count\n\nof extortion.    He appeared before a Magistrate Judge and was\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\freleased on conditions.              On August 2, 2002, he was arrested for\n\nviolating       his   conditions      of   release    after   the   United   States\n\nProbation Office learned that he had attempted to contact Harbour.\n\nOn August 22, 2002, a federal grand jury indicted him on three\n\ncharges:       (1)    Count   One,    conspiracy      to   commit   extortion,    in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 and 875(d); (2) Count Two, extortion,\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 875(d);1 and (3) Count Three, receiving\n\nproceeds of extortion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 880.\n\n               At a January 23, 2003 final pretrial conference, the\n\ndistrict court noted that Ghalashahi might have a defense under the\n\nclaim     of    right     doctrine.        The   government    objected      to   the\n\napplication of the defense.                 The court eventually overruled a\n\nmotion in limine filed by the government seeking to exclude the\n\nclaim of right defense to the extortion charge and any evidence in\n\nsupport of the defense.\n\n               A jury trial commenced on February 4, 2003.              In addition\n\nto   the       evidence    described       above,    the   government   introduced\n\ntelephone records showing that Ghalashahi had made 131 telephone\n\n\n\n     1\n         18 U.S.C. § 875(d) provides:\n\n     Whoever, with intent to extort from any person, firm,\nassociation, or corporation, any money or other thing of value,\ntransmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication\ncontaining any threat to injure the property or reputation of the\naddressee or of another or the reputation of a deceased person or\nany threat to accuse the addressee or any other person of a crime,\nshall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two\nyears, or both.\n\n                                           -6-\n\fcalls to Engelhardt's cell phone from July 2, 2002 through July 23,\n\n2002, and forty-one calls to Harbour's telephone numbers during the\n\nsame   period.      Also,   the    government       introduced   a   series   of\n\nadmissions    by   Ghalashahi     to   law   enforcement    in   which   he   (1)\n\nexplained that every time he had contact with Engelhardt he soon\n\nthereafter spoke either in person or via telephone with Harbour,\n\n(2) admitted his intent to scare Engelhardt, (3) admitted splitting\n\nwith Harbour the $5,000 that Engelhardt paid him on July 2, 2002,\n\nand (4) admitted that a deposit slip in the amount of six thousand\n\ndollars found on his person at the time of the arrest pertained to\n\nsome of the money he expected to receive from Harbour later that\n\nday.   On February 6, the government rested its case and Ghalashahi\n\nmoved for a judgment of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a).\n\nThe court reserved ruling on the motion.             The trial proceeded and\n\nGhalashahi testified in his own defense. He renewed his motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal after the close of all evidence.               The court\n\ndenied his original motion, explicitly stating that it was relying\n\nonly on the evidence presented by the government in its case-in-\n\nchief.   It also denied Ghalashahi's renewed motion.\n\n             On February 7, 2003, the jury found Ghalashahi guilty on\n\nall three counts.      On May 14, 2003, he was sentenced to thirty\n\nmonths   imprisonment       on    Count      One    and   twenty-four    months\n\nimprisonment on Counts Two and Three.              This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fII. DISCUSSION\n\n          In general, we review de novo a district court's ruling\n\non a motion made pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a).    See United\n\nStates v. Diaz, 300 F.3d 66, 78 (1st Cir. 2002).       We view the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to the verdict, draw all\n\nreasonable inferences and credibility disputes in the verdict's\n\nfavor, and then determine whether any rational trier of fact could\n\nhave found the essential elements of the crime beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.   See United States v. Czubinski, 106 F.3d 1069, 1073 (1st\n\nCir. 1997); United States v. Ortiz, 966 F.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (must uphold any verdict that is \"supported by a plausible\n\nrendition of the record\").   Our review spans the totality of the\n\nevidence, both direct and circumstantial, and we \"reject those\n\nevidentiary interpretations and illations that are unreasonable,\n\nunsupportable, or overly speculative.\"   United States v. Spinney,\n\n65 F.3d 231, 234 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          First, Ghalashahi argues that the district court lacked\n\nauthority to reserve its ruling on his motion for judgment of\n\nacquittal made at the end of the government's case-in-chief.   The\n\nplain language of Rule 29 provides otherwise:\n\n          The court on motion of a defendant or of its\n          own motion shall order the entry of judgment\n          of acquittal of one or more offenses charged\n          in the indictment or information after the\n          evidence on either side is closed if the\n          evidence   is  insufficient  to   sustain  a\n          conviction of such offenses.\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fFed. R. Crim P. 29(a).    The rule continues:\n\n          The court may reserve decision on the [Rule\n          29] motion, proceed with the trial (where the\n          motion is made before the close of all the\n          evidence), submit the case to the jury, and\n          decide the motion either before the jury\n          returns a verdict or after it returns a\n          verdict of guilty or is discharged without\n          having returned a verdict.      If the court\n          reserves decision, it must decide the motion\n          on the basis of the evidence at the time the\n          ruling was reserved.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 29(b).    The Advisory Notes to the 1994 amendment\n\nof the rule state that the court is allowed to reserve judgment on\n\na Rule 29 motion made at the close of the government's case-in-\n\nchief:\n\n          The amendment permits the reservation of a\n          motion for a judgment of acquittal made at the\n          close of the government's case in the same\n          manner as the rule now permits for motions\n          made at the close of all of the evidence . . .\n          . While the amendment will not affect a large\n          number of cases, it should remove the dilemma\n          in those close cases in which the court would\n          feel pressured into making an immediate, and\n          possibly erroneous, decision or violating the\n          rule as presently written by reserving its\n          ruling on the motion.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 29 advisory committee's note.           The Advisory\n\nCommittee recognized the problem in a scenario \"where the defense\n\ndecides to present evidence and run the risk that such evidence\n\nwill support the government's case.\"    Id.     The rule takes care of\n\nthat problem by providing that the district court \"consider only\n\nthe evidence submitted at the time of the motion in making its\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fruling, whenever made\" and \"in reviewing a trial's court ruling,\n\nthe appellate court would be similarly limited.\"         Id.\n\n          Here, the district court followed Rule 29's requirements.\n\nIt reserved its ruling on Ghalashahi's motion at the close of the\n\ngovernment's case-in-chief upon concluding that the government's\n\nevidence could sustain a conviction. At the close of all evidence,\n\nthe court denied Ghalashahi's Rule 29 motion (original and renewed)\n\nbased on the same quantum of evidence presented by the government\n\nduring its case-in-chief:\n\n          I reserved ruling on the motion for judgment\n          of acquittal under Rule 29 at the close of the\n          government's   case,   and   considering   the\n          evidence presented by the prosecution in their\n          case in chief, not considering the evidence\n          presented by the defense, focusing solely on\n          the evidence presented by the government, [the\n          government] persuaded me that the indicia of\n          fraud, if you will, could be found by the jury\n          to be evidence of lack of sincerity or honest\n          belief and the legitimacy of the claim of\n          right. And therefore, given Mr. Engelhardt's\n          testimony that a sexual assault or no assault\n          of any type occurred at all, plus the evidence\n          of the actions and demeanor and manner of\n          behavior of the defendant in carrying out the\n          so-called negotiations, the jury could find a\n          reasonable doubt every element of the offense\n          charged, the offense as charged.       So the\n          motion is denied.\n\n          The court concluded that the jury could find beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt every element of the charged offenses based on the\n\ngovernment's   evidence   alone.      We   review   a   district   court's\n\nreservation of a Rule 29 ruling for an abuse of discretion.            See\n\nUnited States v. Davis, 1996 U.S. App. LEXIS 1388, at *7 (6th Cir.\n\n                                   -10-\n\fJan. 16, 1996) (citing United States v. Walton, 908 F.2d 1289, 1294\n\n(6th Cir. 1990)).   We see none here.\n\n          Second, on a more substantive ground, Ghalashahi contends\n\nthat the government failed to submit evidence sufficient to sustain\n\na conviction on any of the charges and that the district court\n\ncommitted reversible error by reserving and then denying his Rule\n\n29 motion for judgment of acquittal.    Specifically, he contends\n\nthat the government failed to disprove his claim of right defense.2\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Ghalashahi had no quibble with how the claim of right defense\nwas presented to the jury. The district court's instruction to the\njury read:\n\n     The defendant cannot be guilty of extortion, or conspiracy to\ncommit extortion, or receipt of the proceeds of extortion if:\n     First, he, or the person on whose behalf he was acting, has a\nvalid claim that he, or the person on whose behalf he was acting,\nhad a valid claim to the money demanded.\n     Second, the facts he allegedly threatened to disclose in an\neffort to collect that money were solely related to that valid\nclaim.\n     And third, he reasonably and honestly believed those facts to\nbe true.\n     Under such circumstances, the defendant could not be said to\nhave acted in a \"wrongful\" manner. Instead, he is said to have\nbeen pursuing a \"claim of right.\"\n. . . In this case, the defendant's alleged use of a threat was not\n\"wrongful\" and the government has failed to carry its burden of\nproof if the defendant was acting under a \"claim of right.\" He was\nacting under a claim of right if he was acting on behalf of, or as\nthe agent of, Melissa Harbour; he had a sincere and honest belief,\neven if mistaken, that Ms. Harbour had a valid claim against Mr.\nEngelhardt for compensation for injuries or other harm she\nsuffered; that is, sexual assault; and the facts the defendant\nallegedly threatened to reveal to the police about Mr. Engelhardt\nwere solely related to that valid claim for compensation for sexual\nassault.\n\n                               -11-\n\f            With   regard   to   Ghalashahi's   Motion   for   Acquittal\n\nsubmitted at the close of the government's case-in-chief, the\n\ndistrict court commented that the government had presented little\n\nevidence on what exactly transpired between Harbour and Engelhardt\n\nduring the sexual encounter. The court advised the government that\n\nit had \"to demonstrate that there is some evidence in this case\n\nfrom which the jury can find that [Ghalashahi] threatened to report\n\nEngelhardt for a crime, and the crime was not related to a claim of\n\nright.\"    The court continued, \"Here the crime is assault of some\n\nkind.     So you have to say the jury could find in this case that\n\nthis defendant did not have a basis to reasonably believe than an\n\nassault of some kind had taken place when he made the threat to\n\nreport [Engelhardt] for the crime of assault.\"\n\n            Though the district court may have thought that the\n\ngovernment's case-in-chief was not the strongest of cases, it also\n\nrecognized the standard of review for Rule 29 motions and the\n\ninappropriateness of a judgment of acquittal, particularly with\n\nregard to the claim of right defense:\n\n            I think the weakness you have, Mr. Norkunas\n            [Ghalashahi's trial counsel], right now is\n            Engelhardt says [the alleged rape] didn't\n            happen.    If the jury believes it didn't\n            happen, they can infer that Ms. Harbour darn\n            well knew it didn't happen. I agree it's kind\n            of a leap next to infer that Ghalashahi\n            therefore knew it didn't happen, but that\n            coupled with the badges of fraud that [the\n            government] is identifying, I suppose there\n            are sufficient badges of fraud here, indicia\n            of fraud, that coupled with Engelhardt's\n\n                                   -12-\n\f           testimony, that they probably could find\n           beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not have\n           genuine belief in the legitimacy of the claim\n           he was advancing.\n\n           It was along these same lines that the district court\n\nlater   denied   Ghalashahi's           Rule   29     motion.      And    indeed,   the\n\ngovernment submitted sufficient evidence from which a reasonable\n\njury could find Ghalashahi guilty of the crimes with which he was\n\ncharged.     The evidence was also sufficient to rebut his claim of\n\nright defense.    First, the government presented evidence that the\n\nsexual encounter between Engelhardt and Harbour was consensual, and\n\nhence lawful.     Engelhardt testified that Engelhardt and Harbour\n\nengaged in a consensual sexual encounter during which Harbour was\n\nconscious and provided him with a condom.                          Upon being shown\n\nphotographs of bruises on Harbour's elbow and buttock, Engelhardt\n\ndenied that anything happened between him and Harbour that would\n\nhave caused the bruises.                From this evidence, the jury could\n\nconclude, at minimum, that Harbour knew that she did not have a\n\nlegitimate claim of right to the money demanded.                     The notion that\n\nGhalashahi    acted    as    her    agent        in   obtaining     the   money     from\n\nEngelhardt--which Ghalashahi has argued strenuously throughout this\n\nlitigation--provides        an    inferential         link   to    Ghalashahi's      own\n\nknowledge that he had no right to the money.                       Without a sexual\n\nassault, there was no possible basis for compensation.\n\n             Second,   and       more     importantly        for   the    purpose     of\n\ndisproving Ghalashahi's claim that he sincerely and reasonably\n\n                                          -13-\n\fbelieved Harbour's claim that she was raped, the district court\n\nnoted the numerous \"indicia of fraud\" on the part of Ghalashahi\n\nfrom which a jury could discredit a claim of right defense.          It is\n\napparent that he did not even know that Engelhardt and Harbour had\n\nengaged in a sexual encounter before Engelhardt had told him.           He\n\nmade more than 130 phone calls to Engelhardt and forty-one calls to\n\nHarbour   over   a   twenty-one   day    period.    He   first   contacted\n\nEngelhardt   using    a   disguised   computer-generated    voice.     The\n\ngovernment also garnered admissions from Ghalashahi that he and\n\nHarbour collaborated to threaten to make a claim of rape unless\n\nEngelhardt paid them money, and that he kept raising the monetary\n\namount demanded and continually threatened to increase the amount\n\nunless Engelhardt paid in full.         In addition, Ghalashahi demanded\n\nthat the money be paid in cash and used code words to disguise the\n\nnature of the transaction.        He and Harbour split the initial\n\npayment of $5,000; thereafter, he expected to receive at least an\n\nadditional $6,000.     Only when Engelhardt agreed to pay the initial\n\n$5,000 did Ghalashahi and Harbour want more and demand more, from\n\n$50,000 to $150,000, and then possibly to as much as $300,000.\n\n           If Ghalashahi knew he was extorting money as an agent for\n\nHarbour--and from his fishy behavior, the jury could conclude\n\nexactly that--then he necessarily knew that he had no lawful claim\n\nto it.    Overall, Ghalashahi's conduct during his \"negotiations\"\n\nwith Engelhardt belies his claim of sincerity or reasonableness in\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fbelieving that     the    money      he   demanded        was   rightfully   his   and\n\nHarbour's.      None of the government's evidence compels a sole\n\nrational     conclusion    in     favor      of     Ghalashahi.        Because     the\n\ngovernment's evidence permits a jury to find otherwise, he is not\n\nentitled to a judgment of acquittal under Rule 29.\n\n             During oral argument on appeal (but not in its brief),\n\nthe government asked us to provide guidance on the applicability of\n\nthe claim of right defense to an § 875 prosecution such as this,\n\nwhere the alleged extortionate threat is an accusation of criminal\n\nconduct.     Specifically, the government suggested that threats to\n\naccuse a person of a crime are explicitly prohibited by the statute\n\nand are inherently wrongful.              Whether to permit a claim of right\n\ndefense in such a situation is an issue of first impression in this\n\ncourt.     As the parties neither presented the issue squarely nor\n\nmeaningfully argued it to us, we need not address it.                    See Grella\n\nv. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank, 42 F.3d 26, 36 (1st Cir. 1994).                      More\n\nimportantly, resolution of the issue would not change the result in\n\nthis case.     Hence, assuming without deciding that the claim of\n\nright    defense   applies      to    this        case,    the    district   court's\n\nreservation and denial of Ghalashahi's Rule 29 motion was proper.\n\n             Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\f",

P.    29   after   the\n\ngovernment's case-in-chief, and thereafter denied both his original\n\nand renewed motions for judgment of acquittal after the close of\n\nall evidence.     We find his arguments unavailing and affirm.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\n            In   the   early   morning       hours     of   June     29,   2002,   Kurt\n\nEngelhardt and Melissa Harbour met at a house party hosted by\n\nHarbour's    friend,    Ava    Weldon,       in   Manchester,        New   Hampshire.\n\nHarbour was highly intoxicated throughout the night--Engelhardt\n\nobserved her falling down three or four times, twice falling to the\n\nground.     According to Engelhardt's testimony at trial, they left\n\nthe party at approximately 6:30 a.m.              After conversing over coffee\n\nat a local restaurant, Harbour invited Engelhardt back to her home.\n\nUpon arrival, she gave him a tour of the home and spoke about her\n\ntwo year-old son. Again according to Engelhardt's trial testimony,\n\nthe   two   proceeded   upstairs       and    thereafter       engaged     in   sexual\n\nintercourse with a condom provided by Harbour.                       Within a short\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\ftime, Engelhardt left the Harbour residence.         He neither asked for\n\nHarbour's telephone number nor gave his number to Harbour.\n\n           Kathryn Burton, a friend of Harbour's who had also\n\nattended the house party, left the Weldon home at approximately 7\n\na.m. She went to Harbour's apartment, went into the second bedroom\n\nacross the hall from Harbour's bedroom, and fell asleep. At trial,\n\nshe testified that Harbour entered the room later in the morning\n\nand was    laughing.   Burton   eventually    left    Harbour's   home   at\n\napproximately 11 a.m. that same day. Before departing, she entered\n\nHarbour's bedroom and observing her sleeping, unsuccessfully tried\n\nto wake her.\n\n           Later that afternoon, Harbour and Weldon got together\n\nagain and went shopping at a local mall.        They then went country\n\nline dancing at a bar in Methuen, Massachusetts.        They returned to\n\nManchester later in the evening, where they visited a couple of\n\nbars through the night, and then had breakfast together in the\n\nearly hours of the morning.\n\n           Weldon testified that, a few days later at Harbour's\n\nrequest,   she   obtained   Engelhardt's     phone    number   from   John\n\nSchiavone, a friend of Engelhardt's, and gave it to Harbour.\n\nWeldon also testified that Ghalashahi and Harbour had been engaged\n\nin a romantic relationship at some point.\n\n           A few days later on July 2, Engelhardt received a number\n\nof voice mail messages in which Ghalashahi, through a computerized\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fvoice, repeated, \"We know what you did.            We're going to the police.\n\nYou have to pick up the phone.            You're a jerk.\"      The following\n\nmorning, Ghalashahi called again and Engelhardt spoke to him for\n\nthe first time. He assumed that the caller was Harbour's boyfriend\n\nand apologized to the caller while explaining that Harbour had told\n\nhim that she did not have a boyfriend.          Ghalashahi told Engelhardt\n\nthat he and Harbour were just friends and then asked Engelhardt to\n\nexplain what happened between him and Harbour.             Engelhardt in turn\n\ntold   Ghalashahi     that   he   and    Harbour    had   engaged   in   sexual\n\nintercourse. Ghalashahi expressed surprise because Harbour had not\n\ntold him that she and Engelhardt had had sex.\n\n           Ghalashahi then told Engelhardt that he had a friend who\n\nhad gone to prison for sexually touching a girl and that Harbour\n\nwas going to report him to the police for rape unless Engelhardt\n\npaid her $5,000.      Later that same day, Engelhardt received another\n\nphone call from Ghalashahi, who this time demanded $50,000 and told\n\nEngelhardt to meet him at a store in Manchester, New Hampshire at\n\napproximately 5:00 p.m. that day.\n\n           At   the    meeting,    Engelhardt       and   Ghalashahi     sat   in\n\nEngelhardt's car.       Ghalashahi identified himself as \"Drew.\"               He\n\ngave Engelhardt a handwritten list of demands, which included a\n\ndemand for a written apology, a sexually transmitted disease test,\n\nand $150,000.       The list gave Engelhardt credit for the $5,000\n\ndemanded earlier in the day, even though at that point it had not\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fbeen paid, and listed an outstanding balance of $145,000.        In\n\nconversation, Ghalashahi told Engelhardt that Harbour had demanded\n\n$300,000, but that he had talked her down to $150,000.   At the end\n\nof the meeting, Engelhardt gave Ghalashahi $5,000. Ghalashahi then\n\ntold Engelhardt that he was going to meet with Harbour, who he said\n\nwas waiting nearby in Ghalashahi's car.\n\n          Between July 3 and July 22, 2002, Ghalashahi called\n\nEngelhardt at least once per day to ask about the money demanded,\n\non some occasions calling several times a day.         On July 22,\n\nEngelhardt contacted the FBI.\n\n          While Engelhardt was describing the events of the past\n\nthree weeks to the FBI, he received a phone call from Ghalashahi.\n\nWith Engelhardt's consent, the FBI recorded the conversation.    At\n\nthe FBI's direction, Engelhardt set up a meeting with Ghalashahi\n\nfor July 23, 2002, mentioning to Ghalashahi that he might not have\n\nall the money by this time.\n\n          Later on July 23, the FBI, again with Engelhardt's\n\nconsent, recorded another phone conversation with Ghalashahi during\n\nwhich Ghalashahi admonished Engelhardt for mentioning the meeting\n\nlocation on the telephone.    Ghalashahi spoke in code, referring to\n\nthe purpose of the meeting as relating to a car purchase and\n\npayment by cashier's check.\n\n          On July 24, 2002, Ghalashahi was charged with one count\n\nof extortion.    He appeared before a Magistrate Judge and was\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\freleased on conditions.              On August 2, 2002, he was arrested for\n\nviolating       his   conditions      of   release    after   the   United   States\n\nProbation Office learned that he had attempted to contact Harbour.\n\nOn August 22, 2002, a federal grand jury indicted him on three\n\ncharges:       (1)    Count   One,    conspiracy      to   commit   extortion,    in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 371 and 875(d); (2) Count Two, extortion,\n\nin violation of 18 U.S.C. § 875(d);1 and (3) Count Three, receiving\n\nproceeds of extortion, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 880.\n\n               At a January 23, 2003 final pretrial conference, the\n\ndistrict court noted that Ghalashahi might have a defense under the\n\nclaim     of    right     doctrine.        The   government    objected      to   the\n\napplication of the defense.                 The court eventually overruled a\n\nmotion in limine filed by the government seeking to exclude the\n\nclaim of right defense to the extortion charge and any evidence in\n\nsupport of the defense.\n\n               A jury trial commenced on February 4, 2003.              In addition\n\nto   the       evidence    described       above,    the   government   introduced\n\ntelephone records showing that Ghalashahi had made 131 telephone\n\n\n\n     1\n         18 U.S.C. § 875(d) provides:\n\n     Whoever, with intent to extort from any person, firm,\nassociation, or corporation, any money or other thing of value,\ntransmits in interstate or foreign commerce any communication\ncontaining any threat to injure the property or reputation of the\naddressee or of another or the reputation of a deceased person or\nany threat to accuse the addressee or any other person of a crime,\nshall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two\nyears, or both.\n\n                                           -6-\n\fcalls to Engelhardt's cell phone from July 2, 2002 through July 23,\n\n2002, and forty-one calls to Harbour's telephone numbers during the\n\nsame   period.      Also,   the    government       introduced   a   series   of\n\nadmissions    by   Ghalashahi     to   law   enforcement    in   which   he   (1)\n\nexplained that every time he had contact with Engelhardt he soon\n\nthereafter spoke either in person or via telephone with Harbour,\n\n(2) admitted his intent to scare Engelhardt, (3) admitted splitting\n\nwith Harbour the $5,000 that Engelhardt paid him on July 2, 2002,\n\nand (4) admitted that a deposit slip in the amount of six thousand\n\ndollars found on his person at the time of the arrest pertained to\n\nsome of the money he expected to receive from Harbour later that\n\nday.   On February 6, the government rested its case and Ghalashahi\n\nmoved for a judgment of acquittal under Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a).\n\nThe court reserved ruling on the motion.             The trial proceeded and\n\nGhalashahi testified in his own defense. He renewed his motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal after the close of all evidence.               The court\n\ndenied his original motion, explicitly stating that it was relying\n\nonly on the evidence presented by the government in its case-in-\n\nchief.   It also denied Ghalashahi's renewed motion.\n\n             On February 7, 2003, the jury found Ghalashahi guilty on\n\nall three counts.      On May 14, 2003, he was sentenced to thirty\n\nmonths   imprisonment       on    Count      One    and   twenty-four    months\n\nimprisonment on Counts Two and Three.              This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fII. DISCUSSION\n\n          In general, we review de novo a district court's ruling\n\non a motion made pursuant to Fed.

The\n\nplain language of Rule 29 provides otherwise:\n\n          The court on motion of a defendant or of its\n          own motion shall order the entry of judgment\n          of acquittal of one or more offenses charged\n          in the indictment or information after the\n          evidence on either side is closed if the\n          evidence   is  insufficient  to   sustain  a\n          conviction of such offenses.\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fFed. R. Crim P. 29(a).    The rule continues:\n\n          The court may reserve decision on the [Rule\n          29] motion, proceed with the trial (where the\n          motion is made before the close of all the\n          evidence), submit the case to the jury, and\n          decide the motion either before the jury\n          returns a verdict or after it returns a\n          verdict of guilty or is discharged without\n          having returned a verdict.      If the court\n          reserves decision, it must decide the motion\n          on the basis of the evidence at the time the\n          ruling was reserved.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 29(b).    The Advisory Notes to the 1994 amendment\n\nof the rule state that the court is allowed to reserve judgment on\n\na Rule 29 motion made at the close of the government's case-in-\n\nchief:\n\n          The amendment permits the reservation of a\n          motion for a judgment of acquittal made at the\n          close of the government's case in the same\n          manner as the rule now permits for motions\n          made at the close of all of the evidence . . .\n          . While the amendment will not affect a large\n          number of cases, it should remove the dilemma\n          in those close cases in which the court would\n          feel pressured into making an immediate, and\n          possibly erroneous, decision or violating the\n          rule as presently written by reserving its\n          ruling on the motion.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 29 advisory committee's note.           The Advisory\n\nCommittee recognized the problem in a scenario \"where the defense\n\ndecides to present evidence and run the risk that such evidence\n\nwill support the government's case.\"    Id.     The rule takes care of\n\nthat problem by providing that the district court \"consider only\n\nthe evidence submitted at the time of the motion in making its\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fruling, whenever made\" and \"in reviewing a trial's court ruling,\n\nthe appellate court would be similarly limited.\"         Id.\n\n          Here, the district court followed Rule 29's requirements.\n\nIt reserved its ruling on Ghalashahi's motion at the close of the\n\ngovernment's case-in-chief upon concluding that the government's\n\nevidence could sustain a conviction. At the close of all evidence,\n\nthe court denied Ghalashahi's Rule 29 motion (original and renewed)\n\nbased on the same quantum of evidence presented by the government\n\nduring its case-in-chief:\n\n          I reserved ruling on the motion for judgment\n          of acquittal under Rule 29 at the close of the\n          government's   case,   and   considering   the\n          evidence presented by the prosecution in their\n          case in chief, not considering the evidence\n          presented by the defense, focusing solely on\n          the evidence presented by the government, [the\n          government] persuaded me that the indicia of\n          fraud, if you will, could be found by the jury\n          to be evidence of lack of sincerity or honest\n          belief and the legitimacy of the claim of\n          right. And therefore, given Mr. Engelhardt's\n          testimony that a sexual assault or no assault\n          of any type occurred at all, plus the evidence\n          of the actions and demeanor and manner of\n          behavior of the defendant in carrying out the\n          so-called negotiations, the jury could find a\n          reasonable doubt every element of the offense\n          charged, the offense as charged.       So the\n          motion is denied.\n\n          The court concluded that the jury could find beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt every element of the charged offenses based on the\n\ngovernment's   evidence   alone.      We   review   a   district   court's\n\nreservation of a Rule 29 ruling for an abuse of discretion.            See\n\nUnited States v.

We see none here.\n\n          Second, on a more substantive ground, Ghalashahi contends\n\nthat the government failed to submit evidence sufficient to sustain\n\na conviction on any of the charges and that the district court\n\ncommitted reversible error by reserving and then denying his Rule\n\n29 motion for judgment of acquittal.    Specifically, he contends\n\nthat the government failed to disprove his claim of right defense.2\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Ghalashahi had no quibble with how the claim of right defense\nwas presented to the jury. The district court's instruction to the\njury read:\n\n     The defendant cannot be guilty of extortion, or conspiracy to\ncommit extortion, or receipt of the proceeds of extortion if:\n     First, he, or the person on whose behalf he was acting, has a\nvalid claim that he, or the person on whose behalf he was acting,\nhad a valid claim to the money demanded.\n     Second, the facts he allegedly threatened to disclose in an\neffort to collect that money were solely related to that valid\nclaim.\n     And third, he reasonably and honestly believed those facts to\nbe true.\n     Under such circumstances, the defendant could not be said to\nhave acted in a \"wrongful\" manner. Instead, he is said to have\nbeen pursuing a \"claim of right.\"\n. . . In this case, the defendant's alleged use of a threat was not\n\"wrongful\" and the government has failed to carry its burden of\nproof if the defendant was acting under a \"claim of right.\" He was\nacting under a claim of right if he was acting on behalf of, or as\nthe agent of, Melissa Harbour; he had a sincere and honest belief,\neven if mistaken, that Ms. Harbour had a valid claim against Mr.\nEngelhardt for compensation for injuries or other harm she\nsuffered; that is, sexual assault; and the facts the defendant\nallegedly threatened to reveal to the police about Mr. Engelhardt\nwere solely related to that valid claim for compensation for sexual\nassault.\n\n                               -11-\n\f            With   regard   to   Ghalashahi's   Motion   for   Acquittal\n\nsubmitted at the close of the government's case-in-chief, the\n\ndistrict court commented that the government had presented little\n\nevidence on what exactly transpired between Harbour and Engelhardt\n\nduring the sexual encounter. The court advised the government that\n\nit had \"to demonstrate that there is some evidence in this case\n\nfrom which the jury can find that [Ghalashahi] threatened to report\n\nEngelhardt for a crime, and the crime was not related to a claim of\n\nright.\"    The court continued, \"Here the crime is assault of some\n\nkind.     So you have to say the jury could find in this case that\n\nthis defendant did not have a basis to reasonably believe than an\n\nassault of some kind had taken place when he made the threat to\n\nreport [Engelhardt] for the crime of assault.\"\n\n            Though the district court may have thought that the\n\ngovernment's case-in-chief was not the strongest of cases, it also\n\nrecognized the standard of review for Rule 29 motions and the\n\ninappropriateness of a judgment of acquittal, particularly with\n\nregard to the claim of right defense:\n\n            I think the weakness you have, Mr. Norkunas\n            [Ghalashahi's trial counsel], right now is\n            Engelhardt says [the alleged rape] didn't\n            happen.    If the jury believes it didn't\n            happen, they can infer that Ms. Harbour darn\n            well knew it didn't happen. I agree it's kind\n            of a leap next to infer that Ghalashahi\n            therefore knew it didn't happen, but that\n            coupled with the badges of fraud that [the\n            government] is identifying, I suppose there\n            are sufficient badges of fraud here, indicia\n            of fraud, that coupled with Engelhardt's\n\n                                   -12-\n\f           testimony, that they probably could find\n           beyond a reasonable doubt that he did not have\n           genuine belief in the legitimacy of the claim\n           he was advancing.\n\n           It was along these same lines that the district court\n\nlater   denied   Ghalashahi's           Rule   29     motion.      And    indeed,   the\n\ngovernment submitted sufficient evidence from which a reasonable\n\njury could find Ghalashahi guilty of the crimes with which he was\n\ncharged.     The evidence was also sufficient to rebut his claim of\n\nright defense.    First, the government presented evidence that the\n\nsexual encounter between Engelhardt and Harbour was consensual, and\n\nhence lawful.     Engelhardt testified that Engelhardt and Harbour\n\nengaged in a consensual sexual encounter during which Harbour was\n\nconscious and provided him with a condom.                          Upon being shown\n\nphotographs of bruises on Harbour's elbow and buttock, Engelhardt\n\ndenied that anything happened between him and Harbour that would\n\nhave caused the bruises.                From this evidence, the jury could\n\nconclude, at minimum, that Harbour knew that she did not have a\n\nlegitimate claim of right to the money demanded.                     The notion that\n\nGhalashahi    acted    as    her    agent        in   obtaining     the   money     from\n\nEngelhardt--which Ghalashahi has argued strenuously throughout this\n\nlitigation--provides        an    inferential         link   to    Ghalashahi's      own\n\nknowledge that he had no right to the money.                       Without a sexual\n\nassault, there was no possible basis for compensation.\n\n             Second,   and       more     importantly        for   the    purpose     of\n\ndisproving Ghalashahi's claim that he sincerely and reasonably\n\n                                          -13-\n\fbelieved Harbour's claim that she was raped, the district court\n\nnoted the numerous \"indicia of fraud\" on the part of Ghalashahi\n\nfrom which a jury could discredit a claim of right defense.          It is\n\napparent that he did not even know that Engelhardt and Harbour had\n\nengaged in a sexual encounter before Engelhardt had told him.           He\n\nmade more than 130 phone calls to Engelhardt and forty-one calls to\n\nHarbour   over   a   twenty-one   day    period.    He   first   contacted\n\nEngelhardt   using    a   disguised   computer-generated    voice.     The\n\ngovernment also garnered admissions from Ghalashahi that he and\n\nHarbour collaborated to threaten to make a claim of rape unless\n\nEngelhardt paid them money, and that he kept raising the monetary\n\namount demanded and continually threatened to increase the amount\n\nunless Engelhardt paid in full.         In addition, Ghalashahi demanded\n\nthat the money be paid in cash and used code words to disguise the\n\nnature of the transaction.        He and Harbour split the initial\n\npayment of $5,000; thereafter, he expected to receive at least an\n\nadditional $6,000.     Only when Engelhardt agreed to pay the initial\n\n$5,000 did Ghalashahi and Harbour want more and demand more, from\n\n$50,000 to $150,000, and then possibly to as much as $300,000.\n\n           If Ghalashahi knew he was extorting money as an agent for\n\nHarbour--and from his fishy behavior, the jury could conclude\n\nexactly that--then he necessarily knew that he had no lawful claim\n\nto it.    Overall, Ghalashahi's conduct during his \"negotiations\"\n\nwith Engelhardt belies his claim of sincerity or reasonableness in\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\fbelieving that     the    money      he   demanded        was   rightfully   his   and\n\nHarbour's.      None of the government's evidence compels a sole\n\nrational     conclusion    in     favor      of     Ghalashahi.        Because     the\n\ngovernment's evidence permits a jury to find otherwise, he is not\n\nentitled to a judgment of acquittal under Rule 29.\n\n             During oral argument on appeal (but not in its brief),\n\nthe government asked us to provide guidance on the applicability of\n\nthe claim of right defense to an § 875 prosecution such as this,\n\nwhere the alleged extortionate threat is an accusation of criminal\n\nconduct.     Specifically, the government suggested that threats to\n\naccuse a person of a crime are explicitly prohibited by the statute\n\nand are inherently wrongful.              Whether to permit a claim of right\n\ndefense in such a situation is an issue of first impression in this\n\ncourt.     As the parties neither presented the issue squarely nor\n\nmeaningfully argued it to us, we need not address it.                    See Grella\n\nv. Salem Five Cent Sav. Bank, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"684074\"><a href=\"/opinion/684074/paul-j-grella-trustee-v-salem-five-cent-savings-bank/\"><span class=\"volume\">42</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 36 (1st Cir. 1994).                      More\n\nimportantly, resolution of the issue would not change the result in\n\nthis case.     Hence, assuming without deciding that the claim of\n\nright    defense   applies      to    this        case,    the    district   court's\n\nreservation and denial of Ghalashahi's Rule 29 motion was proper.\n\n             Accordingly, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -15-\n\f</pre>",
