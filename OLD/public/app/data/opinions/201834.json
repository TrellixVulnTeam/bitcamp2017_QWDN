Moore, United States Attorney, on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                            September 22, 2005\n\f           Per Curiam. Richard Gambaro pled guilty to intentionally\n\ndistributing 53 grams of crack cocaine and was sentenced to 151\n\nmonths' imprisonment, five years' supervised release, and a fine of\n\n$16,735.40.   He now appeals from his sentence on four grounds:\n\n(1) that the district court erred in failing to specify the number\n\nand timing of drug tests that he must undergo while on supervised\n\nrelease; (2) that the district court impermissibly imposed the\n\nstandard conditions of supervised release in its written judgment\n\nwithout first announcing them orally at sentencing; (3) that the\n\ndistrict court erred in imposing a fine without considering his\n\nability to pay and without making necessary findings; and (4) that\n\nhe is entitled to resentencing under Blakely v. Washington, 124 S.\n\nCt. 2531 (2004), and United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738\n\n(2005).   Because none of those issues was raised below, they are\n\nreviewed only for plain error.    United States v. Glenn, 389 F.3d\n\n283, 288 (1st Cir. 2004).   Finding no such error, we affirm.\n\n1.   Drug Testing Conditions of Supervised Release\n\n           Gambaro first argues that the district court violated 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3583(d) and USSG § 5D1.3(a)(4)1 by failing to specify the\n\nmaximum number and timing of drug tests that he must undergo while\n\non supervised release.   That argument can be quickly disposed of.\n\n\n\n     1\n      Both of those provisions mandate that a defendant on\nsupervised release be required to submit to one drug test within 15\ndays of release and at least two periodic drug tests thereafter\n\"(as determined by the court).\"\n\n                                 -2-\n\f          As to the number of drug tests, the written judgment\n\nspecifies that \"[t]he defendant shall submit to one drug test\n\nwithin 15 days of release from imprisonment and at least two\n\nperiodic drug tests thereafter.\"   We have construed that language\n\nas judicially capping the number of drug tests at three.    United\n\nStates v. Lewandowski, 372 F.3d 470, 471 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          Gambaro provides no authority for the proposition that\n\nthe district court was further required to specify the intervals at\n\nwhich drug tests will be administered, and we have found none.\n\nMoreover, even if the district court had clearly erred in failing\n\nto specify the timing of the drug tests, such an error would not\n\nsatisfy the third and fourth prongs of the plain error test.\n\nUnited States v. Padilla, 415 F.3d 211, 221-22 (1st Cir. 2005) (en\n\nbanc).\n\n2. Failure to Specify Conditions of Supervised Release at\nSentencing\n\n          Next, Gambaro argues that the district court's failure to\n\nannounce the specific terms of the drug testing condition or the\n\nstandard conditions of supervised release at sentencing violated\n\nhis right to be present at sentencing.   That argument also lacks\n\nmerit.\n\n          Such a violation exists only where there is a \"material\n\nconflict\" between the conditions announced at sentencing and those\n\ncontained in the written judgment.     United States v. Meléndez-\n\nSantana, 353 F.3d 93, 100 (1st Cir. 2003), overruled, in part, on\n\n                               -3-\n\fother grounds by Padilla.             No such conflict exists between the\n\nlanguage of the written drug testing condition and the more general\n\nlanguage of the orally imposed requirement that Gambaro participate\n\nin \"periodic testing to determine whether or not [he] is using,\"\n\nparticularly where the written condition, as construed above, does\n\nnot   require   more   than    the    three    drug     tests   required    by   the\n\napplicable statute, 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d), of which Gambaro had\n\nconstructive notice.          United States v. De Los Santos, 2005 WL\n\n2035234, at *4 (1st Cir. Aug. 24, 2005); United States v. Tulloch,\n\n380 F.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           Nor did the district court err in failing to announce at\n\nsentencing the thirteen standard conditions of supervised release\n\ncontained in the written judgment.              At sentencing, the district\n\ncourt expressly stated that Gambaro would be subject to supervision\n\nby the probation department after his release from prison and\n\nspecifically mentioned the conditions prohibiting drug use and\n\nrequiring work at a lawful occupation.                 Moreover, as this court\n\npreviously   recognized,       \"the    standard       conditions   either    impose\n\nrequirements    essential       to    the     basic     administration      of   the\n\nsupervised release system, or regulate other matters necessary to\n\neffect the purpose of supervised release . . . [and] are so\n\nuniformly imposed that they have become boilerplate in federal\n\ncourts.\"     Id. at 14 n.8.            Consequently, this court found it\n\n\"doubt[ful] that defendants can legitimately claim surprise or\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fraise right-to-be-present claims when the standard conditions set\n\nout in the Guidelines are included in a written judgment without\n\nhaving been mentioned at the sentencing hearing.\"    Id.\n\n3.   The Fine\n\n            Gambaro challenges the $16,735.40 fine primarily on the\n\ngrounds that the district court imposed it without considering his\n\nability to pay and without making any findings as to the relevant\n\nfactors.2    Those arguments are foreclosed by our prior decisions\n\nholding that express consideration of and findings concerning a\n\ndefendant's ability to pay and other relevant factors are not\n\nrequired.    See United States v. Rowe, 268 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir.\n\n2001); United States v. Lujan, 324 F.3d 27, 34 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nHere, moreover, the district court did expressly consider Gambaro's\n\nability to pay and other relevant factors and made express findings\n\nthat the fine imposed was warranted in light of those factors.\n\n4.   Blakely/Booker Error\n\n            While this appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided\n\nfirst Blakely and then Booker, and the parties were permitted to\n\nfile supplemental briefs addressing each of those cases.         The\n\nparties agree that Gambaro's Blakely/Booker claim was not preserved\n\n\n     2\n      Gambaro also argues that restitution was improper here\nbecause there was no victim. That argument misses the mark because\nno restitution was ordered. His perfunctory statement, without\ndeveloped argument or authority, that the fine violated the\nExcessive Fines clause of the Eighth Amendment need not be\naddressed. See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n1990).\n\n                                 -5-\n\fbelow and that the first two prongs of the plain error standard are\n\nsatisfied since Gambaro was sentenced under the then-mandatory\n\nGuidelines.    Therefore, the issue here reduces to whether Gambaro\n\nhas shown a \"reasonable probability that the district court would\n\nimpose a different sentence more favorable to [him] under the new\n\n'advisory     Guidelines'    Booker     regime.\"     United    States    v.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 75 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Gambaro's attempt to make that showing falls short.         The\n\nmitigating    factors   he   points    to--his   limited   education,   his\n\nlearning disabilities and allegedly diminished mental capacity, his\n\nhistory of alcohol and drug abuse, his parents' divorce, his\n\nmother's alcohol abuse, his lack of lawful employment, and his\n\npost-offense participation in a drug counseling program--were all\n\nproffered, considered, and rejected below as grounds for a downward\n\ndeparture.    There is no indication that the judge would be more\n\nsympathetic to those same factors under advisory Guidelines.            See,\n\ne.g., United States v. McLean, 409 F.3d 492, 505 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Although the judge repeatedly characterized the sentence\n\nas \"long,\" she indicated that a long sentence, supervised release,\n\nand a fine were all necessary for purposes of rehabilitation and\n\ndeterrence of future crimes, particularly given Gambaro's long and\n\nserious criminal history, which the judge characterized as among\n\nthe worst she had ever seen.           Given those comments, it is not\n\nreasonably probable that the court would impose a lower sentence\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\funder advisory guidelines.   See, e.g., United States v. Figuereo,\n\n404 F.3d 537, 541 & n.6 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Accordingly, the district court's judgment is summarily\n\naffirmed.   See Local R. 23(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f",

McLean, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790402\"><a href=\"/opinion/790402/united-states-v-dale-mclean-united-states-of-america-v-manolin-feliz/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 505 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Although the judge repeatedly characterized the sentence\n\nas \"long,\" she indicated that a long sentence, supervised release,\n\nand a fine were all necessary for purposes of rehabilitation and\n\ndeterrence of future crimes, particularly given Gambaro's long and\n\nserious criminal history, which the judge characterized as among\n\nthe worst she had ever seen.           Given those comments, it is not\n\nreasonably probable that the court would impose a lower sentence\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\funder advisory guidelines.   See, e.g., United States v. Figuereo,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201542\"><a href=\"/opinion/201542/united-states-v-figuereo/\"><span class=\"volume\">404</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">537</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 541 & n.6 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            Accordingly, the district court's judgment is summarily\n\naffirmed.   See Local R. 23(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f</pre>",
