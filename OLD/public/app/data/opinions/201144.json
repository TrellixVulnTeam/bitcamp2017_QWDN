Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Joannie Plaza-Martinez, Assistant Federal Public Defender,\nwith whom Joseph C. Laws, Jr., Federal Public Defender, was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Irene C. Feldman, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nH.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Jorge E. Vega-Pacheco, Chief,\nCriminal Division, and Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant United States\nAttorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          July 21, 2004\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.   Four days into a criminal trial,\n\nthe district court discovered that a juror had been absent for some\n\ntime and, having previously discharged the lone alternate, declared\n\na mistrial sua sponte.      Defendant-appellant José Toribio-Lugo\n\nthereafter moved to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy\n\ngrounds.     The district court denied that motion.    This appeal\n\nensued.    After careful review, we conclude that the lower court\n\nerred in refusing to dismiss the indictment.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n             On June 6, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted the\n\nappellant for various narcotics offenses.   See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1), 952(a).   The court empaneled a jury of twelve, plus one\n\nalternate.     Trial commenced on August 13, 2001.    The alternate\n\njuror experienced a personal problem and the judge excused her on\n\nthe second day of trial.\n\n           At the start of the fourth day, the courtroom deputy\n\ninformed the judge that only eleven jurors were present. The judge\n\nimmediately consulted with both the prosecutor and the appellant's\n\nlawyers. He outlined two options: either postpone the trial until\n\nthe twelfth juror could be located or proceed with a jury of\n\neleven.    See Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(b)(2)(A) (permitting the parties\n\nin a criminal case to stipulate to trial by a jury of fewer than\n\ntwelve at any time before the verdict).   Defense counsel asked why\n\nthe juror was missing and, in virtually the same breath, began to\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fexpress her viewpoint.     She stated:    \"The thing is I'm thinking\n\nabout --\".      That was as far as she got.        The district judge\n\ninterrupted, declaring:      \"This is very simple.          [The missing\n\njuror's] not here.    She's not here.    She might be dead.       She may\n\nbe ill.    It doesn't make any difference.\"         Chastened, defense\n\ncounsel conferred with her client and informed the judge that the\n\nappellant did not wish to proceed at that moment with eleven\n\njurors, but, rather, would \"like to wait for twelve jurors, a\n\ntwelve-member    jury.\"   The   judge   then   terminated   the    sidebar\n\nconference, announcing that the trial would be postponed until the\n\ntwelfth juror could be found.\n\n          Almost immediately thereafter, the judge learned that the\n\nproblem was more complex than he initially had thought.           Thus, he\n\nexcused the jury and told the attorneys what he had learned:          that\n\nthe missing juror had been absent during some or all of the earlier\n\nportions of the trial.    The judge then announced that he was going\n\nto declare a mistrial because only eleven jurors had heard the\n\nevidence and he did not believe that there was any way to cure that\n\ndefect.   The prosecutor promptly asked for a new trial date, but\n\nthe judge, seemingly anticipating a double jeopardy challenge,\n\ndeclined the request.     Defense counsel tried to articulate her\n\nclient's position.    She stated:   \"Our position is that --\".         The\n\njudge once again cut her off mid-sentence, saying:             \"Counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fWait.\"   He then began questioning the courtroom deputy about the\n\nnumber of jurors originally empaneled.\n\n            The shape of the fiasco soon emerged.         On the morning of\n\nAugust 13 (the first day of trial), twelve jurors and one alternate\n\nwere sworn.   For reasons that remain obscure, one of the empaneled\n\njurors   vanished   later   that   morning.        No   one   —   neither    the\n\nprosecutor, nor defense counsel, nor the courtroom deputy, nor the\n\njudge — noticed the juror's absence, and the trial proceeded apace.\n\nThis state of blissful ignorance still existed when, on the second\n\ntrial day, the judge, with the assent of both parties, dismissed\n\nthe alternate juror.      The upshot was that only twelve jurors had\n\nbegun to hear evidence in the case and only eleven of them had been\n\npresent from the second day forward.\n\n            After recounting this bizarre sequence of events, the\n\ndistrict judge expressed some uncertainty about whether, in the\n\nevent of a mistrial, the Double Jeopardy Clause would bar retrial\n\nof the appellant.     The judge invited the attorneys to brief the\n\nissue. Defense counsel again endeavored to be heard, but the judge\n\nagain thwarted her attempt.         He then reconvened the jury and,\n\nacting sua sponte, declared a mistrial.\n\n            When thereafter the government moved for a new trial\n\ndate, the appellant objected and cross-moved for dismissal of the\n\nindictment on double jeopardy grounds.        Briefs were submitted.          On\n\nSeptember   24,   2001,   the   district   judge    denied    the   motion    to\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fdismiss.1     United States v. Toribio-Lugo, 164 F. Supp. 2d 251\n\n(D.P.R. 2001).   The judge predicated his ruling on two alternative\n\ngrounds.    First, he concluded that a mistrial was required by\n\nmanifest necessity because only eleven jurors remained and the\n\nappellant had refused to proceed with fewer than twelve.       Id. at\n\n253-54.     Second, he concluded that the appellant had, in all\n\nevents, consented to the declaration of a mistrial. Id. at 254-55.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n            In the ordinary course, a defendant cannot pursue an\n\nimmediate appeal from an interlocutory order in a criminal case.\n\nLike virtually every general rule, this rule admits of various\n\nexceptions — and one such exception allows immediate appeals from\n\ndenials of motions to dismiss premised on colorable double jeopardy\n\ngrounds.    See Abney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651, 662 (1977);\n\nUnited States v. Keene, 287 F.3d 229, 232 (1st Cir. 2002).       This\n\ncase comes within that exception.      We turn, then, to the merits of\n\nthe appeal.\n\n                     A.   Background Principles.\n\n            The Double Jeopardy Clause ensures that no person shall\n\n\"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of\n\n\n\n      1\n      On the same date, the district judge rescheduled the trial.\nThe judge thereafter denied the appellant's motion to stay retrial\npending appeal. The appellant has since been retried, convicted,\nand sentenced. He is presently serving that sentence.\n\n                                 -5-\n\flife or limb.\"       U.S. Const. amend. V.           In a jury trial, jeopardy\n\nattaches when the jury is sworn.                Crist v. Bretz, 437 U.S. 28, 35\n\n(1978). That jeopardy attaches at this early stage, rather than at\n\nfinal judgment, is a recognition of the defendant's prized right to\n\nhave his trial, once under way, completed by a particular trier.\n\nArizona v. Washington, 434 U.S. 497, 503 (1978).\n\n             The    prophylaxis      of    the     Double    Jeopardy      Clause   is\n\nthreefold.     See United States v. Ortiz-Alarcon, 917 F.2d 651, 653\n\n(1st Cir. 1990) (delineating the three main types of protection\n\nconferred).        One such protection restrains the government from\n\nusing its power and resources to subject a defendant to serial\n\nprosecutions, thus prolonging his ordeal and unfairly enhancing the\n\nprospect of his ultimate conviction.                Green v. United States, 355\n\nU.S. 184, 187-88 (1957).          Despite its importance, however, the\n\nprotection against serial prosecutions is not absolute.\n\n            Mistrials exemplify the need for exceptions.                      When a\n\nmistrial is declared before the jury returns its verdict, jeopardy\n\nmay or may not attach.        In other words, double jeopardy principles\n\ndo not automatically bar reprosecution, Washington, 434 U.S. at\n\n505, and the circumstances of each case must be examined to\n\ndetermine    where     that   case    falls       along     the   double    jeopardy\n\ncontinuum.    If, say, the defendant has consented to a mistrial or\n\nmanifest necessity has precipitated it, the prosecution ordinarily\n\nmay proceed anew.      See United States v. Dinitz, 424 U.S. 600, 611-\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\f12 (1976) (finding no double jeopardy bar where the defendant had\n\nmoved for a mistrial); United States v. Perez, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.)\n\n579, 579-80 (1824) (finding no double jeopardy bar where the\n\nexistence     of    a   deadlocked      jury    made   a   mistrial   manifestly\n\nnecessary).         These outcomes reflect an understanding that \"a\n\ndefendant's    valued     right    to    have    his   trial    completed      by   a\n\nparticular tribunal must in some instances be subordinated to the\n\npublic's    interest      in    fair    trials    designed     to   end   in   just\n\njudgments.\"        Wade v. Hunter, 336 U.S. 684, 689 (1949).\n\n                           B.    Standard of Review.\n\n            The baseline standard of review applicable to a denial of\n\na motion to dismiss on double jeopardy grounds following the\n\ndeclaration of a mistrial is abuse of discretion.                     See, e.g.,\n\nWashington, 434 U.S. at 514; Keene, 287 F.3d at 233.                  In light of\n\nthe important constitutional right involved, appellate review must\n\nensure that the trial court indulged in a \"scrupulous exercise of\n\njudicial discretion.\"           United States v. Jorn, 400 U.S. 470, 485\n\n(1971) (plurality op.).          This entails accepting the trial court's\n\nfactual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.                 United States\n\nv. Bradshaw, 281 F.3d 278, 291 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S.\n\n1049 (2002). Articulations of law engender de novo review. Keene,\n\n287 F.3d at 233.         A mistake of law is, a fortiori, an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.        United States v. Snyder, 136 F.3d 65, 67 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\f            Here, the threshold determination that the appellant\n\nconsented to the declaration of a mistrial has both factual and\n\nlegal components.       Consistent with the paradigm limned above, we\n\nreview the district court's factual findings for clear error.\n\nWhether   the   facts    as   found   add    up   to    consent    is     a   legal\n\ndetermination that we review de novo.                  Cf. Ornelas v. United\n\nStates, 517 U.S. 690, 696-98 (1996) (applying this multifaceted\n\nstandard of review to determinations of probable cause).\n\n                         C.   Manifest Necessity.\n\n            Like the district court, we first inquire into the\n\nexistence vel non of manifest necessity (after all, if a mistrial\n\nwas occasioned by manifest necessity, then the question of consent\n\nbecomes immaterial). The Supreme Court initially coined the phrase\n\n\"manifest necessity\" in the early nineteenth century.                    In Perez,\n\nJustice Story wrote:\n\n            [T]he law has invested Courts of justice with\n            the authority to discharge a jury from giving\n            any verdict, whenever, in their opinion,\n            taking    all    the    circumstances     into\n            consideration, there is a manifest necessity\n            for the act, or the ends of public justice\n            would otherwise be defeated.     They are to\n            exercise a sound discretion on the subject;\n            and it is impossible to define all the\n            circumstances, which would render it proper to\n            interfere. To be sure, the power ought to be\n            used with the greatest caution, under urgent\n            circumstances, and for very plain and obvious\n            causes; . . . .\n\n22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) at 580.            Attempts to define the term more\n\nprecisely   —   beyond   tautological       acknowledgments       that    manifest\n\n                                      -8-\n\fnecessity demands a \"high degree\" of necessity, Washington, 434\n\nU.S. at 506 — have not been helpful.     Experience teaches that there\n\nis no mechanical rule for determining whether a mistrial is (or is\n\nnot) supported by manifest necessity.     Illinois v. Somerville, 410\n\nU.S. 458, 462 (1973).   Consequently, \"an appellate court's inquiry\n\ninevitably reduces to whether the district judge's declaration of\n\na mistrial was reasonably necessary under all the circumstances.\"\n\nKeene, 287 F.3d at 234.    Typically, this inquiry is informed by a\n\ntriumvirate of interrelated factors:      (i) whether alternatives to\n\na mistrial were explored and exhausted; (ii) whether counsel had an\n\nopportunity to be heard; and (iii) whether the judge's decision was\n\nmade after sufficient reflection.      See id.; see also United States\n\nv. Simonetti, 998 F.2d 39, 41 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            In the case at hand, there was a clear alternative to a\n\nmistrial:    proceeding with eleven jurors.     Although the Criminal\n\nRules normally require a twelve-member jury in a criminal case, see\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 23(b)(1), the parties may by agreement proceed\n\nwith fewer than twelve, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(b)(2)(A).     Thus, it\n\nwas within the power of the district court to continue with eleven\n\njurors as long as the parties consented to doing so.\n\n            The district court only tentatively explored — and never\n\nexhausted — that possibility.          Instead, the court mistakenly\n\nconcluded that the alternative was foreclosed by the appellant's\n\ninitial expression of a preference to wait and see if the twelfth\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fjuror could be found.   Toribio-Lugo, 164 F. Supp. 2d at 254.   As we\n\nexplain below, the record does not support the court's conclusion\n\nthat the expression of that preference slammed the door on the\n\n\"jury of eleven\" alternative.\n\n            When the district court discovered that a juror was\n\nmissing, it presented the lawyers with two options:        either to\n\npostpone the proceedings until the vanished juror could be located\n\nor to proceed with a jury of eleven.          As between these two\n\nalternatives, the appellant chose the former.        The court never\n\noffered the appellant a choice between proceeding with eleven\n\njurors or accepting a mistrial.        To cinch matters, the court,\n\nduring the pertinent time frame, made no effort to ascertain the\n\nappellant's attitude or wishes with regard to the possibility of a\n\nmistrial.     In view of these omissions, the record compels a\n\nconclusion that the \"jury of eleven\" alternative was not adequately\n\nexplored.\n\n            That conclusion is dispositive on this point.       Where\n\nthere is a viable alternative to a mistrial and the district court\n\nfails adequately to explore it, a finding of manifest necessity\n\ncannot stand.   See, e.g., United States v. Ramirez, 884 F.2d 1524,\n\n1529-30 (1st Cir. 1989); Brady v. Samaha, 667 F.2d 224, 229-30 (1st\n\nCir. 1981).   This is such a case.   Accordingly, we reject the lower\n\ncourt's holding that its declaration of a mistrial was supported by\n\nmanifest necessity.\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f                             D.   Consent.\n\n           In the absence of manifest necessity, double jeopardy\n\nprinciples require that a defendant retain primary control over\n\nwhether or not to abort an ongoing trial.       See Dinitz, 424 U.S. at\n\n609.   Withal, the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause are at\n\nmost a series of personal defenses, so they may be waived or\n\nvitiated by consent.    Id. at 607; United States v. DiPietro, 936\n\nF.2d 6, 9 (1st Cir. 1991).   This brings us to the district court's\n\nalternate holding: that the appellant consented to the declaration\n\nof a mistrial.\n\n           In this context, consent may be express, such as where\n\nthe defendant himself moves for a mistrial without having been\n\ngoaded into doing so by misconduct attributable to the government.\n\nE.g., Dinitz, 424 U.S. at 607-12.        The requisite consent may also\n\nbe implied from a defendant's acts or failures to act, such as\n\nwhere the defendant sits silently by and does not object to the\n\ndeclaration of a mistrial even though he has a fair opportunity to\n\ndo so.   E.g., DiPietro, 936 F.2d at 9-11.     Even so, the implication\n\nof consent is not lightly to be indulged.      Any such finding must be\n\nconsistent with the defendant's valued right to trial before a\n\nparticular jury and his concomitant interest in deciding whether to\n\ntake the case from that jury.\n\n           In this instance, the district court concluded that the\n\nappellant consented to the declaration of a mistrial twice over.\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fThe court first extrapolated consent from the appellant's refusal\n\nto proceed with eleven jurors.              Toribio-Lugo, 164 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n254.   For the reasons previously discussed, see supra Part II(C),\n\nwe reject this extrapolation.            Choosing to await the return of a\n\nmissing   juror      over   proceeding      with    a    jury    of   eleven   cannot\n\nreasonably    be     construed   as    consent      to    the    declaration    of   a\n\nmistrial.\n\n             There is, however, more to this case. The district court\n\nalso held that the appellant impliedly consented to the declaration\n\nof a mistrial by his silence when the court announced its intention\n\nto abort the proceedings.             Id.     The integrity of this finding\n\npresents a     close    question:        as   the   district       court   correctly\n\nobserved, defense counsel was present throughout and did not object\n\nto the declaration of a mistrial at any point.\n\n             Under most circumstances, such silence might well permit\n\na finding of implied consent. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols,\n\n977 F.2d 972, 974-75 (5th Cir. 1992) (per curiam); DiPietro, 936\n\nF.2d at 11; Camden v. Circuit Court, 892 F.2d 610, 612-18 (7th Cir.\n\n1989).    But this case is different.                   Implying consent from a\n\nfailure to object requires, at a bare minimum, that the defendant\n\nhas had an adequate opportunity to register an effective objection.\n\nCompare DiPietro, 936 F.2d at 11 (implying consent where defense\n\ncounsel sat     in    the   courtroom       for   several       minutes   during   the\n\nannouncement of a mistrial without objecting), with Love v. Morton,\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\f112 F.3d 131, 138-39 (3d Cir. 1997) (rejecting a finding of implied\n\nconsent where the trial judge, in a state of grief after learning\n\nof a death in his family, abruptly ordered a mistrial and left the\n\nbench).   Thus, the question reduces to whether defense counsel had\n\na fair opportunity to object here.\n\n           The   district   court    answered   this   question   in   the\n\naffirmative.     The court found that defense counsel had several\n\nchances to voice an objection:\n\n           For several minutes after the Court announced\n           its decision to declare a mistrial, both\n           defense   counsel   and   government   counsel\n           remained in the courtroom.    Defense counsel\n           was present as the Court questioned the\n           courtroom deputy as to the whereabouts of the\n           missing juror.    Next, defense counsel was\n           present while the Court expressed its concern\n           over [the] government's motion to set a new\n           trial date.    Finally, defense counsel was\n           present as the Court explained the reason for\n           the mistrial to the jury before discharging\n           them.   At no timefrom [sic] the moment the\n           Court declared a mistrial to the moment it\n           discharged the jury did defense counsel object\n           to the mistrial.\n\nToribio-Lugo, 164 F. Supp. 2d at 254-55.         We accept the court's\n\nfactual findings that defense counsel was present at all relevant\n\ntimes and lodged no formal objection. In the circumstances of this\n\ncase, however, those facts tell only a part of the story.         And when\n\nthe full panoply of facts is taken into account, the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that counsel had an adequate opportunity to\n\nobject becomes insupportable.\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f             The dynamics of a trial are important to its outcome. To\n\ndo her job, a lawyer must be forceful, but she also must handle her\n\nrelationship with the presiding judge with care.                \"Nothing goes\n\nfurther to disturb the proper atmosphere of a trial than [a\n\nlawyer's] reiterated insistence upon a position which the judge has\n\nonce considered and decided.\" Keen v. Overseas Tankship Corp., 194\n\nF.2d 515, 519 (2d Cir. 1952) (L. Hand, J.).              It follows that when\n\na   lawyer   repeatedly      attempts    to   state   her    position    but   is\n\nrepeatedly rebuffed, there will come a point at which further\n\ninsistence can have deleterious consequences.               A lawyer ought not\n\nto be required to persist stubbornly when the judge has made it\n\nperfectly clear that he does not wish to hear what the lawyer has\n\nto say.      Cf. Douglas v. Alabama, 380 U.S. 415, 422 (1965) (\"No\n\nlegitimate state interest would have been served by requiring\n\nrepetition of a patently futile objection, already thrice rejected,\n\nin a situation in which repeated objection might well affront the\n\ncourt or prejudice the jury beyond repair.\").\n\n             In this case, defense counsel made either two or three\n\nattempts to     be   heard    during    the   district   court's   sua    sponte\n\nconsideration of whether or not to declare a mistrial.2                  On each\n\noccasion, the court stopped counsel in her tracks, cutting her off\n\n\n      2\n      The parties spar over whether the first attempt was part of\nthat colloquy. For present purposes, that is a distinction without\na difference. What counts is that the judge set the tone for the\nproceedings that followed by interrupting the lawyer in mid-\nsentence as she tried to state her client's position.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fonce when the court was addressing the issue of whether to wait for\n\nthe missing juror and twice more when the court was addressing the\n\nissue of manifest necessity.              It was only after these three\n\nattempts to state her position had been firmly rebuffed that\n\ndefense    counsel    lapsed    into    silence.     To   hold,     under   these\n\ncircumstances, that the appellant freely, albeit tacitly, consented\n\nto the discharging of the jury would mock reality and at the same\n\ntime condone an unfortunate curtness on the part of the district\n\ncourt.    We do not think that consent to a mistrial fairly can be\n\ninferred from enforced silence.\n\n            Let us be perfectly clear.           We do not mean to say that\n\nbeing    silenced    by   a   judge    always   correlates   with    a   lack   of\n\nopportunity to object.         See generally United States v. Mejia, 909\n\nF.2d 242, 248 (7th Cir. 1990) (explaining that counsel \"has a duty\n\nto object, and even at the risk of incurring the displeasure of the\n\ntrial court, to insist upon his objection\") (citations omitted).\n\nHere, however, a confluence of factors, especially the number of\n\ntimes that defense counsel was stymied and the relatively brief\n\nperiod of time that elapsed, militates strongly in favor of a\n\nconclusion that consent should not be implied.3\n\n\n     3\n      In fairness, it seems quite likely that the court was\nlaboring under the assumption that the appellant's earlier decision\nto wait for the missing juror and, concomitantly, to eschew\nproceeding with a jury of eleven at that point was an absolute\nrejection of the \"jury of eleven\" alternative. Ordinarily, counsel\nwould bear some responsibility for clearing up this sort of\nconfusion — and we might hesitate to find an abuse of discretion\n\n                                       -15-\n\f            With all due respect for the good faith of the district\n\njudge (which we do not doubt), we conclude that a fundamental\n\nconstitutional right of an accused should not be snatched away in\n\nsuch uncertain circumstances.         Consequently, we hold that the\n\ndistrict court's second basis for its finding of consent is, like\n\nits first, untenable.\n\n            That ends the matter.     In the absence of either manifest\n\nnecessity   or   binding   consent,   jeopardy   attached.    Thus,   the\n\nappellant's reprosecution was not constitutionally permissible.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe reverse the order appealed from and remand the case to the\n\ndistrict    court   with   directions    to   vacate   the   defendant's\n\nconviction. See supra note 1. The district court should thereupon\n\ndismiss the indictment.\n\n\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\nhad the lawyer sat idly by and lackadaisically allowed the court to\nproceed under a false assumption. Here, however, defense counsel\nthrice attempted to be heard — and on all three occasions the court\ncut her off.\n\n                                  -16-\n\f",

Four days into a criminal trial,\n\nthe district court discovered that a juror had been absent for some\n\ntime and, having previously discharged the lone alternate, declared\n\na mistrial sua sponte.      Defendant-appellant José Toribio-Lugo\n\nthereafter moved to dismiss the indictment on double jeopardy\n\ngrounds.     The district court denied that motion.    This appeal\n\nensued.    After careful review, we conclude that the lower court\n\nerred in refusing to dismiss the indictment.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n             On June 6, 2001, a federal grand jury indicted the\n\nappellant for various narcotics offenses.   See, e.g., 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n841(a)(1), 952(a).   The court empaneled a jury of twelve, plus one\n\nalternate.     Trial commenced on August 13, 2001.    The alternate\n\njuror experienced a personal problem and the judge excused her on\n\nthe second day of trial.\n\n           At the start of the fourth day, the courtroom deputy\n\ninformed the judge that only eleven jurors were present. The judge\n\nimmediately consulted with both the prosecutor and the appellant's\n\nlawyers. He outlined two options: either postpone the trial until\n\nthe twelfth juror could be located or proceed with a jury of\n\neleven.    See Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(b)(2)(A) (permitting the parties\n\nin a criminal case to stipulate to trial by a jury of fewer than\n\ntwelve at any time before the verdict).   Defense counsel asked why\n\nthe juror was missing and, in virtually the same breath, began to\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fexpress her viewpoint.     She stated:    \"The thing is I'm thinking\n\nabout --\".      That was as far as she got.        The district judge\n\ninterrupted, declaring:      \"This is very simple.          [The missing\n\njuror's] not here.    She's not here.    She might be dead.       She may\n\nbe ill.    It doesn't make any difference.\"         Chastened, defense\n\ncounsel conferred with her client and informed the judge that the\n\nappellant did not wish to proceed at that moment with eleven\n\njurors, but, rather, would \"like to wait for twelve jurors, a\n\ntwelve-member    jury.\"   The   judge   then   terminated   the    sidebar\n\nconference, announcing that the trial would be postponed until the\n\ntwelfth juror could be found.\n\n          Almost immediately thereafter, the judge learned that the\n\nproblem was more complex than he initially had thought.           Thus, he\n\nexcused the jury and told the attorneys what he had learned:          that\n\nthe missing juror had been absent during some or all of the earlier\n\nportions of the trial.    The judge then announced that he was going\n\nto declare a mistrial because only eleven jurors had heard the\n\nevidence and he did not believe that there was any way to cure that\n\ndefect.   The prosecutor promptly asked for a new trial date, but\n\nthe judge, seemingly anticipating a double jeopardy challenge,\n\ndeclined the request.     Defense counsel tried to articulate her\n\nclient's position.    She stated:   \"Our position is that --\".         The\n\njudge once again cut her off mid-sentence, saying:             \"Counsel.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fWait.\"   He then began questioning the courtroom deputy about the\n\nnumber of jurors originally empaneled.\n\n            The shape of the fiasco soon emerged.         On the morning of\n\nAugust 13 (the first day of trial), twelve jurors and one alternate\n\nwere sworn.   For reasons that remain obscure, one of the empaneled\n\njurors   vanished   later   that   morning.        No   one   —   neither    the\n\nprosecutor, nor defense counsel, nor the courtroom deputy, nor the\n\njudge — noticed the juror's absence, and the trial proceeded apace.\n\nThis state of blissful ignorance still existed when, on the second\n\ntrial day, the judge, with the assent of both parties, dismissed\n\nthe alternate juror.      The upshot was that only twelve jurors had\n\nbegun to hear evidence in the case and only eleven of them had been\n\npresent from the second day forward.\n\n            After recounting this bizarre sequence of events, the\n\ndistrict judge expressed some uncertainty about whether, in the\n\nevent of a mistrial, the Double Jeopardy Clause would bar retrial\n\nof the appellant.     The judge invited the attorneys to brief the\n\nissue. Defense counsel again endeavored to be heard, but the judge\n\nagain thwarted her attempt.         He then reconvened the jury and,\n\nacting sua sponte, declared a mistrial.\n\n            When thereafter the government moved for a new trial\n\ndate, the appellant objected and cross-moved for dismissal of the\n\nindictment on double jeopardy grounds.        Briefs were submitted.          On\n\nSeptember   24,   2001,   the   district   judge    denied    the   motion    to\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fdismiss.1     United States v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">251</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(D.P.R. 2001).   The judge predicated his ruling on two alternative\n\ngrounds.    First, he concluded that a mistrial was required by\n\nmanifest necessity because only eleven jurors remained and the\n\nappellant had refused to proceed with fewer than twelve.       Id. at\n\n253-54.     Second, he concluded that the appellant had, in all\n\nevents, consented to the declaration of a mistrial. Id. at 254-55.\n\nThis appeal followed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n            In the ordinary course, a defendant cannot pursue an\n\nimmediate appeal from an interlocutory order in a criminal case.\n\nLike virtually every general rule, this rule admits of various\n\nexceptions — and one such exception allows immediate appeals from\n\ndenials of motions to dismiss premised on colorable double jeopardy\n\ngrounds.

In other words, double jeopardy principles\n\ndo not automatically bar reprosecution, Washington, 434 U.S. at\n\n505, and the circumstances of each case must be examined to\n\ndetermine    where     that   case    falls       along     the   double    jeopardy\n\ncontinuum.

Manifest Necessity.\n\n            Like the district court, we first inquire into the\n\nexistence vel non of manifest necessity (after all, if a mistrial\n\nwas occasioned by manifest necessity, then the question of consent\n\nbecomes immaterial). The Supreme Court initially coined the phrase\n\n\"manifest necessity\" in the early nineteenth century.                    In Perez,\n\nJustice Story wrote:\n\n            [T]he law has invested Courts of justice with\n            the authority to discharge a jury from giving\n            any verdict, whenever, in their opinion,\n            taking    all    the    circumstances     into\n            consideration, there is a manifest necessity\n            for the act, or the ends of public justice\n            would otherwise be defeated.     They are to\n            exercise a sound discretion on the subject;\n            and it is impossible to define all the\n            circumstances, which would render it proper to\n            interfere. To be sure, the power ought to be\n            used with the greatest caution, under urgent\n            circumstances, and for very plain and obvious\n            causes; . . . .\n\n22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) at 580.            Attempts to define the term more\n\nprecisely   —   beyond   tautological       acknowledgments       that    manifest\n\n                                      -8-\n\fnecessity demands a \"high degree\" of necessity, Washington, 434\n\nU.S. at 506 — have not been helpful.     Experience teaches that there\n\nis no mechanical rule for determining whether a mistrial is (or is\n\nnot) supported by manifest necessity.     Illinois v. Somerville, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108729\"><a href=\"/opinion/108729/illinois-v-somerville/\"><span class=\"volume\">410</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">458</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 462 (1973).   Consequently, \"an appellate court's inquiry\n\ninevitably reduces to whether the district judge's declaration of\n\na mistrial was reasonably necessary under all the circumstances.\"\n\nKeene, 287 F.3d at 234.    Typically, this inquiry is informed by a\n\ntriumvirate of interrelated factors:      (i) whether alternatives to\n\na mistrial were explored and exhausted; (ii) whether counsel had an\n\nopportunity to be heard; and (iii) whether the judge's decision was\n\nmade after sufficient reflection.      See id.; see also United States\n\nv. Simonetti, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610899\"><a href=\"/opinion/610899/united-states-v-domenic-simonetti/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 41 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n            In the case at hand, there was a clear alternative to a\n\nmistrial:    proceeding with eleven jurors.     Although the Criminal\n\nRules normally require a twelve-member jury in a criminal case, see\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 23(b)(1), the parties may by agreement proceed\n\nwith fewer than twelve, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 23(b)(2)(A).     Thus, it\n\nwas within the power of the district court to continue with eleven\n\njurors as long as the parties consented to doing so.\n\n            The district court only tentatively explored — and never\n\nexhausted — that possibility.          Instead, the court mistakenly\n\nconcluded that the alternative was foreclosed by the appellant's\n\ninitial expression of a preference to wait and see if the twelfth\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fjuror could be found.   Toribio-Lugo, 164 F. Supp. 2d at 254.   As we\n\nexplain below, the record does not support the court's conclusion\n\nthat the expression of that preference slammed the door on the\n\n\"jury of eleven\" alternative.\n\n            When the district court discovered that a juror was\n\nmissing, it presented the lawyers with two options:        either to\n\npostpone the proceedings until the vanished juror could be located\n\nor to proceed with a jury of eleven.          As between these two\n\nalternatives, the appellant chose the former.        The court never\n\noffered the appellant a choice between proceeding with eleven\n\njurors or accepting a mistrial.        To cinch matters, the court,\n\nduring the pertinent time frame, made no effort to ascertain the\n\nappellant's attitude or wishes with regard to the possibility of a\n\nmistrial.     In view of these omissions, the record compels a\n\nconclusion that the \"jury of eleven\" alternative was not adequately\n\nexplored.\n\n            That conclusion is dispositive on this point.       Where\n\nthere is a viable alternative to a mistrial and the district court\n\nfails adequately to explore it, a finding of manifest necessity\n\ncannot stand.   See, e.g., United States v. Ramirez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"529280\"><a href=\"/opinion/529280/united-states-v-daniel-phisco-ramirez-united-states-v-jairo/\"><span class=\"volume\">884</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1524</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n1529-30 (1st Cir. 1989); Brady v. Samaha, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398206\"><a href=\"/opinion/398206/eileen-m-brady-martha-brickett-robert-r-cushing-jr-kristie-conrad/\"><span class=\"volume\">667</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 229-30 (1st\n\nCir. 1981).   This is such a case.   Accordingly, we reject the lower\n\ncourt's holding that its declaration of a mistrial was supported by\n\nmanifest necessity.\n\n\n                                -10-\n\f                             D.   Consent.\n\n           In the absence of manifest necessity, double jeopardy\n\nprinciples require that a defendant retain primary control over\n\nwhether or not to abort an ongoing trial.       See Dinitz, 424 U.S. at\n\n609.   Withal, the protections of the Double Jeopardy Clause are at\n\nmost a series of personal defenses, so they may be waived or\n\nvitiated by consent.    Id. at 607; United States v. DiPietro, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563217\"><a href=\"/opinion/563217/united-states-v-robyn-dipietro/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (1st Cir. 1991).   This brings us to the district court's\n\nalternate holding: that the appellant consented to the declaration\n\nof a mistrial.\n\n           In this context, consent may be express, such as where\n\nthe defendant himself moves for a mistrial without having been\n\ngoaded into doing so by misconduct attributable to the government.\n\nE.g., Dinitz, 424 U.S. at 607-12.        The requisite consent may also\n\nbe implied from a defendant's acts or failures to act, such as\n\nwhere the defendant sits silently by and does not object to the\n\ndeclaration of a mistrial even though he has a fair opportunity to\n\ndo so.   E.g., DiPietro, 936 F.2d at 9-11.     Even so, the implication\n\nof consent is not lightly to be indulged.      Any such finding must be\n\nconsistent with the defendant's valued right to trial before a\n\nparticular jury and his concomitant interest in deciding whether to\n\ntake the case from that jury.\n\n           In this instance, the district court concluded that the\n\nappellant consented to the declaration of a mistrial twice over.\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fThe court first extrapolated consent from the appellant's refusal\n\nto proceed with eleven jurors.              Toribio-Lugo, 164 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n254.   For the reasons previously discussed, see supra Part II(C),\n\nwe reject this extrapolation.            Choosing to await the return of a\n\nmissing   juror      over   proceeding      with    a    jury    of   eleven   cannot\n\nreasonably    be     construed   as    consent      to    the    declaration    of   a\n\nmistrial.\n\n             There is, however, more to this case. The district court\n\nalso held that the appellant impliedly consented to the declaration\n\nof a mistrial by his silence when the court announced its intention\n\nto abort the proceedings.             Id.     The integrity of this finding\n\npresents a     close    question:        as   the   district       court   correctly\n\nobserved, defense counsel was present throughout and did not object\n\nto the declaration of a mistrial at any point.\n\n             Under most circumstances, such silence might well permit\n\na finding of implied consent. See, e.g., United States v. Nichols,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"593208\"><a href=\"/opinion/593208/united-states-v-michael-edward-nichols/\"><span class=\"volume\">977</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">972</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 974-75 (5th Cir. 1992) (per curiam); DiPietro, 936\n\nF.2d at 11; Camden v.

But this case is different.                   Implying consent from a\n\nfailure to object requires, at a bare minimum, that the defendant\n\nhas had an adequate opportunity to register an effective objection.\n\nCompare DiPietro, 936 F.2d at 11 (implying consent where defense\n\ncounsel sat     in    the   courtroom       for   several       minutes   during   the\n\nannouncement of a mistrial without objecting), with Love v. Morton,\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\f</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"739971\"><a href=\"/opinion/739971/harold-love-v-willis-morton-administrator-njsp-peter-verniero-attorney/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">131</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 138-39 (3d Cir. 1997) (rejecting a finding of implied\n\nconsent where the trial judge, in a state of grief after learning\n\nof a death in his family, abruptly ordered a mistrial and left the\n\nbench).   Thus, the question reduces to whether defense counsel had\n\na fair opportunity to object here.\n\n           The   district   court    answered   this   question   in   the\n\naffirmative.     The court found that defense counsel had several\n\nchances to voice an objection:\n\n           For several minutes after the Court announced\n           its decision to declare a mistrial, both\n           defense   counsel   and   government   counsel\n           remained in the courtroom.    Defense counsel\n           was present as the Court questioned the\n           courtroom deputy as to the whereabouts of the\n           missing juror.    Next, defense counsel was\n           present while the Court expressed its concern\n           over [the] government's motion to set a new\n           trial date.    Finally, defense counsel was\n           present as the Court explained the reason for\n           the mistrial to the jury before discharging\n           them.   At no timefrom [sic] the moment the\n           Court declared a mistrial to the moment it\n           discharged the jury did defense counsel object\n           to the mistrial.\n\nToribio-Lugo, 164 F. Supp. 2d at 254-55.         We accept the court's\n\nfactual findings that defense counsel was present at all relevant\n\ntimes and lodged no formal objection. In the circumstances of this\n\ncase, however, those facts tell only a part of the story.         And when\n\nthe full panoply of facts is taken into account, the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that counsel had an adequate opportunity to\n\nobject becomes insupportable.\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f             The dynamics of a trial are important to its outcome. To\n\ndo her job, a lawyer must be forceful, but she also must handle her\n\nrelationship with the presiding judge with care.                \"Nothing goes\n\nfurther to disturb the proper atmosphere of a trial than [a\n\nlawyer's] reiterated insistence upon a position which the judge has\n\nonce considered and decided.\" Keen v. Overseas Tankship Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"228748\"><a href=\"/opinion/228748/keen-v-overseas-tankship-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 519 (2d Cir. 1952) (L. Hand, J.).              It follows that when\n\na   lawyer   repeatedly      attempts    to   state   her    position    but   is\n\nrepeatedly rebuffed, there will come a point at which further\n\ninsistence can have deleterious consequences.               A lawyer ought not\n\nto be required to persist stubbornly when the judge has made it\n\nperfectly clear that he does not wish to hear what the lawyer has\n\nto say.      Cf. Douglas v. Alabama, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107015\"><a href=\"/opinion/107015/douglas-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 422 (1965) (\"No\n\nlegitimate state interest would have been served by requiring\n\nrepetition of a patently futile objection, already thrice rejected,\n\nin a situation in which repeated objection might well affront the\n\ncourt or prejudice the jury beyond repair.\").\n\n             In this case, defense counsel made either two or three\n\nattempts to     be   heard    during    the   district   court's   sua    sponte\n\nconsideration of whether or not to declare a mistrial.2                  On each\n\noccasion, the court stopped counsel in her tracks, cutting her off\n\n\n      2\n      The parties spar over whether the first attempt was part of\nthat colloquy. For present purposes, that is a distinction without\na difference. What counts is that the judge set the tone for the\nproceedings that followed by interrupting the lawyer in mid-\nsentence as she tried to state her client's position.\n\n                                       -14-\n\fonce when the court was addressing the issue of whether to wait for\n\nthe missing juror and twice more when the court was addressing the\n\nissue of manifest necessity.              It was only after these three\n\nattempts to state her position had been firmly rebuffed that\n\ndefense    counsel    lapsed    into    silence.     To   hold,     under   these\n\ncircumstances, that the appellant freely, albeit tacitly, consented\n\nto the discharging of the jury would mock reality and at the same\n\ntime condone an unfortunate curtness on the part of the district\n\ncourt.    We do not think that consent to a mistrial fairly can be\n\ninferred from enforced silence.\n\n            Let us be perfectly clear.           We do not mean to say that\n\nbeing    silenced    by   a   judge    always   correlates   with    a   lack   of\n\nopportunity to object.         See generally United States v. Mejia, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545256\"><a href=\"/opinion/545256/united-states-v-rodrigo-mejia/\"><span class=\"volume\">909</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">242</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 248 (7th Cir. 1990) (explaining that counsel \"has a duty\n\nto object, and even at the risk of incurring the displeasure of the\n\ntrial court, to insist upon his objection\") (citations omitted).\n\nHere, however, a confluence of factors, especially the number of\n\ntimes that defense counsel was stymied and the relatively brief\n\nperiod of time that elapsed, militates strongly in favor of a\n\nconclusion that consent should not be implied.3\n\n\n     3\n      In fairness, it seems quite likely that the court was\nlaboring under the assumption that the appellant's earlier decision\nto wait for the missing juror and, concomitantly, to eschew\nproceeding with a jury of eleven at that point was an absolute\nrejection of the \"jury of eleven\" alternative. Ordinarily, counsel\nwould bear some responsibility for clearing up this sort of\nconfusion — and we might hesitate to find an abuse of discretion\n\n                                       -15-\n\f            With all due respect for the good faith of the district\n\njudge (which we do not doubt), we conclude that a fundamental\n\nconstitutional right of an accused should not be snatched away in\n\nsuch uncertain circumstances.         Consequently, we hold that the\n\ndistrict court's second basis for its finding of consent is, like\n\nits first, untenable.\n\n            That ends the matter.     In the absence of either manifest\n\nnecessity   or   binding   consent,   jeopardy   attached.    Thus,   the\n\nappellant's reprosecution was not constitutionally permissible.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe reverse the order appealed from and remand the case to the\n\ndistrict    court   with   directions    to   vacate   the   defendant's\n\nconviction. See supra note 1. The district court should thereupon\n\ndismiss the indictment.\n\n\n\nReversed and remanded.\n\n\n\n\nhad the lawyer sat idly by and lackadaisically allowed the court to\nproceed under a false assumption. Here, however, defense counsel\nthrice attempted to be heard — and on all three occasions the court\ncut her off.\n\n                                  -16-\n\f</pre>",
