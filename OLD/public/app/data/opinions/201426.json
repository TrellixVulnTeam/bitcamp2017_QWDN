Torres, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n           Torruella, Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Christopher M. Mulhearn, with whom W.

Gulf 95, Inc. sued Roger Lariviere in Rhode\n\nIsland superior court alleging that he had converted, for his own\n\nuse and benefit, certain valuable property.         Following removal on\n\ndiversity   grounds,   Lariviere    filed   an   answer   and   third-party\n\ncomplaint against Nandy Sarda1, the sole owner of Gulf, alleging\n\nbreach of contract and seeking indemnification and contribution.\n\nFollowing a bench trial, the district court found in favor of Gulf\n\non its conversion claim and rejected Lariviere's claims. The court\n\nentered judgment against Lariviere in the amount of $164,133.33,\n\nplus interest.     Lariviere brings this appeal to challenge the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence supporting the court's damages award.\n\n            In the mid-1980s, Gulf purchased a number of steel and\n\naluminum truss assembly systems for use in the construction of\n\nconcrete buildings in Florida.      Each system is composed of either\n\nsteel or aluminum trusses and component parts that allow the\n\ntrusses to be assembled into forms.         When assembled, these forms\n\npermit a contractor to pour concrete decks on each level of a\n\nbuilding under construction.       After completion of each floor, the\n\nforms can be moved up to the next floor with a crane.            These so-\n\ncalled “flying forms” eliminate the need to construct concrete\n\nforms at each level and thus increase the speed of construction\n\n\n     1\n      The third-party defendant, appellee, appears on the district\ncourt docket, and on our own docket, as “Mandi Sardi.” For the\npurposes of this opinion, however, we adopt the spelling of\nappellee's name reflected in the trial transcript and in appellees'\nbrief, “Nandy Sarda.”\n\n                                   -2-\n\fwhile lessening the cost.       As a result, truss assembly systems can\n\nbe quite valuable.\n\n          Gulf    used    its     truss   assembly   systems   to   build\n\napproximately 20 high-rise buildings during a five year period in\n\nthe late 1980s.   After Gulf discontinued its Florida construction\n\noperation, the systems were removed, first to a storage site in\n\nMassachusetts, and subsequently to a site in Rhode Island owned by\n\nthe Flexicore Corporation, a manufacturer of precast concrete slabs\n\nthat, like Gulf, is wholly owned by Nandy Sarda.        The systems were\n\nstacked on pallets along the rear fence line of the Flexicore\n\nproperty and were never again used by Gulf or Flexicore.            Nandy\n\nSarda's nephew, Anthony Sarda, prepared a written inventory of the\n\ntruss systems when they arrived at the Flexicore plant in early\n\n1991.   Included on that inventory were 910 steel trusses, 244\n\naluminum trusses, and the necessary component parts (also referred\n\nto as accessories).      Nandy Sarda's secretary subsequently printed\n\nan official version of the inventory for record-keeping purposes.\n\n          In 1996, Anthony Sarda hired Lariviere as an independent\n\ncontractor to perform maintenance on forklifts and other equipment\n\nat the Flexicore plant.         Before Anthony Sarda left Flexicore in\n\nSeptember 1998, he undertook a second inventory of the truss\n\nassembly systems.     This second count (which was not reduced to\n\nwriting) confirmed that the 1991 inventory was still accurate.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f            As Flexicore's operations wound down in the late 1990s,\n\nLariviere's duties gradually transformed from that of repairman to\n\nthat of caretaker.     By 1999, Lariviere assumed the role of the\n\nprimary caretaker of the plant and was given access to the entire\n\nfacility.    That same year, Nandy Sarda put the plant up for sale.\n\nSarda's real estate agent suggested that, in order to facilitate a\n\nsale, the large amount of debris and equipment scattered across the\n\nproperty be cleared.\n\n            At this point the litigants' stories diverge.          Lariviere\n\nclaims that Nandy Sarda instructed him to clear the property of all\n\ndebris, including the truss assembly systems, and that he and Sarda\n\nagreed that he could retain the proceeds from the sale of any\n\nmaterial he could sell for scrap.            Sarda admits that he did\n\nendeavor to clear the site of debris, but denies having given\n\nLariviere authority to scrap or sell any of the systems.             To the\n\ncontrary,   Sarda   contends   that   he   told   Lariviere   on    multiple\n\noccasions that the systems were valuable and should not be sold or\n\nscrapped.\n\n            Regardless, Lariviere made arrangements to begin removing\n\nthe truss assembly systems from the property in late spring of\n\n2000.   He sold the steel trusses to two scrap metal companies and\n\nmany of the aluminum trusses to independent scrap collectors.\n\nLariviere collected approximately $10,500 for his efforts.            Sarda,\n\nwho was living in Nevada at the time, was unaware of these\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\ftransactions.    Lariviere completed the clean-up of the site in\n\nDecember 2000.    By this time, all that remained of the truss\n\nassembly systems were 30 aluminum trusses.\n\n           In the spring of 2001, Brooks Miner, a broker of concrete\n\nforms and related construction equipment, contacted Sarda about\n\npurchasing   Sarda's    truss   assembly     systems.       Although    Sarda\n\npreviously had rebuffed similar overtures from Miner, he agreed\n\nthis time to negotiate a sale and forwarded to Miner the 1991\n\ninventory.   Based on the inventory, Miner gave Sarda an estimated\n\nquote, see infra note 3, and then traveled to the Flexicore plant\n\nto inspect the systems himself.          When he arrived, he found that\n\nonly 30 aluminum trusses remained.           Miner reported to Sarda his\n\ndisappointment that most of the systems on the inventory were\n\nmissing.     He did, however, agree to purchase the 30 aluminum\n\ntrusses for $9,200.2\n\n           Sarda was surprised to learn that the truss assembly\n\nsystems were missing and immediately traveled to Rhode Island to\n\ninspect the site himself.        When Sarda confronted Lariviere in\n\nperson, Lariviere      acknowledged   that    he   had   sold   many   of   the\n\nsystems' components to various third parties.            Sarda and Lariviere\n\nattempted to retrieve the systems from those third parties but were\n\n\n\n     2\n      There was conflicting testimony as to whether Miner paid\n$9,200 or $9,270 for the 30 aluminum trusses.       But because\nLariviere does not contest the issue, we adopt the $9,200 figure\nfound by the district court.\n\n                                   -5-\n\funsuccessful.   This lawsuit ensued and was tried to the district\n\ncourt, which concluded that Sarda did not authorize Lariviere to\n\nscrap the systems; that the trusses were in complete and marketable\n\ncondition at the time that they were scrapped; and that the fair\n\nmarket value of the systems at the time they were converted was\n\n$173,333.33.3   The court subtracted from that sum the $9,200 that\n\nGulf had received from Miner for the 30 aluminum trusses and\n\nentered judgment for Gulf in the amount of $164,133.33, plus\n\ninterest.\n\n\n\n     3\n      The district court's market value calculation was based upon\nthe testimony of Miner. Having been in the business of buying and\nselling similar systems for 43 years Miner was competent to testify\nas to market value. He testified that it is customary to pay a\npercentage of the original purchase price, or list price, when\nbuying a used truss assembly system, the discount depending on the\ncondition of the equipment and the completeness of the set (i.e.,\nwhether the system has all of its component parts).       Before he\ntraveled to Rhode Island to inspect Gulf's equipment personally,\nMiner quoted Sarda an estimate of 30 percent of the list price for\nthe systems reflected on the 1991 inventory. Miner testified that\nthis 30 percent estimate represented the median of the standard\nvalue range (20 to 40 percent) for truss assembly systems of that\nage. His 30 percent estimate was based on dual assumptions that\nGulf's systems included a complete set of accessories, and that\nthey were in average condition for systems of their age. According\nto Miner, 30 percent of the list price yielded a range of between\n$260,000 and $300,000 for the entire set of Gulf's systems.\n     Finding that the trusses had some surface rust, and that the\naccessories were not in good condition, the district court declined\nto use Miner's median estimate of 30 percent of the list price for\nits fair market value calculation. Rather, the court based its\ncalculation on the low end of the standard range Miner had\nmentioned in his testimony: 20 percent of the list price. Twenty\npercent of the list price yielded a range of $173,333 to $200,000.\nAgain, acknowledging the poor condition of the accessories, the\ncourt selected the low end of that range, $173,333, as representing\nGulf's damages.\n\n                                -6-\n\f           Lariviere's only developed argument on appeal is that the\n\nevidence did not support the district court's conclusion as to the\n\nfair market value of the truss assembly systems at the time they\n\nwere converted in 2000. In pressing this argument, Lariviere makes\n\ntwo subsidiary assertions about the state of the evidence before\n\nthe court:    first,     that   the    1991   inventory      provides    the   only\n\ncredible evidence concerning the number of components in the\n\nsystems,   but    that   the    1991   inventory      is   too   far   removed   to\n\nconstitute probative evidence of the completeness of the systems at\n\nthe time of conversion (in 2000); and second, that there was no\n\nevidence concerning the quality and/or condition of the systems at\n\nthe time   of     conversion.      Because     of    these   evidentiary       gaps,\n\nLariviere contends, the court had no basis for concluding that the\n\nsystems had any value beyond their scrap value (established to be\n\napproximately $10,500) at the time they were converted.\n\n           Lariviere's appeal is built on too stingy a reading of\n\nthe record.      While it is true that the 1991 inventory provides the\n\nonly documentary evidence in the record concerning the number of\n\ncomponents in Gulf's truss assembly systems, there was no shortage\n\nof testimonial evidence on this issue.              This testimonial evidence,\n\nfound credible by the court, was sufficient to ground the judgment\n\nentered. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a) (factual determinations made at\n\na bench trial “shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous”);\n\nUnited States v. 15 Bosworth St., 236 F.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fIt was not clearly erroneous for the court to credit Anthony\n\nSarda's testimony that his 1998 recount confirmed that all of\n\nGulf's systems were still present on the property at that time.\n\nNor did the court clearly err in choosing to credit Nandy Sarda's\n\ntestimony that he did not observe any changes to the stacks of\n\nequipment during any of his visits to the plant throughout the\n\n1990s.    In sum, although Gulf did not provide the court with a\n\nwritten year 2000 inventory, there is no reason for us to question\n\nthe court's determination that the systems remained complete up\n\nuntil the time they were converted.\n\n           So too with the court's determination that the systems\n\nwere of marketable quality.     On this point, the court reasonably\n\ncredited testimony that Gulf stored the trusses in the customary\n\nmanner:    the steel trusses were treated with baked-on paint to\n\navoid rusting (the aluminum trusses were not painted because\n\naluminum does not rust) and were stacked on pallets to elevate them\n\nfrom the ground.   There was credible testimony that trusses are\n\ncustomarily stored outside because of their size and because the\n\nweather does not ordinarily affect their condition when they are\n\npainted and stacked properly.    The court also reasonably credited\n\nthe testimony of several witnesses, including the caretaker of the\n\npremises before Lariviere assumed the job in 1999, who testified\n\nthat the trusses (though not the accessories) appeared to be in\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fgood condition at various times as late as 1999.4      Although the\n\ncourt did conclude that the accessories had acquired significant\n\nrust due to improper storage, the court did not find that the\n\naccessories were non-functional.    Nor did the evidence compel such\n\na finding.    Thus, we see no clear error in the line that the court\n\nchose to draw:    that the systems were in marketable condition, but\n\nbecause the accessories (an important component of the systems)\n\nwere significantly rusted, only at a price at the lowest end of the\n\nrange in which systems of that age ordinarily sell.   See supra note\n\n3.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      These witnesses testified that, to the extent that rust was\nobserved on the trusses, it was only surface rust, which the court\nreasonably accepted as being insignificant to the trusses' value.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

When Sarda confronted Lariviere in\n\nperson, Lariviere      acknowledged   that    he   had   sold   many   of   the\n\nsystems' components to various third parties.            Sarda and Lariviere\n\nattempted to retrieve the systems from those third parties but were\n\n\n\n     2\n      There was conflicting testimony as to whether Miner paid\n$9,200 or $9,270 for the 30 aluminum trusses.       But because\nLariviere does not contest the issue, we adopt the $9,200 figure\nfound by the district court.\n\n                                   -5-\n\funsuccessful.   This lawsuit ensued and was tried to the district\n\ncourt, which concluded that Sarda did not authorize Lariviere to\n\nscrap the systems; that the trusses were in complete and marketable\n\ncondition at the time that they were scrapped; and that the fair\n\nmarket value of the systems at the time they were converted was\n\n$173,333.33.3   The court subtracted from that sum the $9,200 that\n\nGulf had received from Miner for the 30 aluminum trusses and\n\nentered judgment for Gulf in the amount of $164,133.33, plus\n\ninterest.\n\n\n\n     3\n      The district court's market value calculation was based upon\nthe testimony of Miner. Having been in the business of buying and\nselling similar systems for 43 years Miner was competent to testify\nas to market value. He testified that it is customary to pay a\npercentage of the original purchase price, or list price, when\nbuying a used truss assembly system, the discount depending on the\ncondition of the equipment and the completeness of the set (i.e.,\nwhether the system has all of its component parts).       Before he\ntraveled to Rhode Island to inspect Gulf's equipment personally,\nMiner quoted Sarda an estimate of 30 percent of the list price for\nthe systems reflected on the 1991 inventory. Miner testified that\nthis 30 percent estimate represented the median of the standard\nvalue range (20 to 40 percent) for truss assembly systems of that\nage. His 30 percent estimate was based on dual assumptions that\nGulf's systems included a complete set of accessories, and that\nthey were in average condition for systems of their age. According\nto Miner, 30 percent of the list price yielded a range of between\n$260,000 and $300,000 for the entire set of Gulf's systems.\n     Finding that the trusses had some surface rust, and that the\naccessories were not in good condition, the district court declined\nto use Miner's median estimate of 30 percent of the list price for\nits fair market value calculation. Rather, the court based its\ncalculation on the low end of the standard range Miner had\nmentioned in his testimony: 20 percent of the list price. Twenty\npercent of the list price yielded a range of $173,333 to $200,000.\nAgain, acknowledging the poor condition of the accessories, the\ncourt selected the low end of that range, $173,333, as representing\nGulf's damages.\n\n                                -6-\n\f           Lariviere's only developed argument on appeal is that the\n\nevidence did not support the district court's conclusion as to the\n\nfair market value of the truss assembly systems at the time they\n\nwere converted in 2000. In pressing this argument, Lariviere makes\n\ntwo subsidiary assertions about the state of the evidence before\n\nthe court:    first,     that   the    1991   inventory      provides    the   only\n\ncredible evidence concerning the number of components in the\n\nsystems,   but    that   the    1991   inventory      is   too   far   removed   to\n\nconstitute probative evidence of the completeness of the systems at\n\nthe time of conversion (in 2000); and second, that there was no\n\nevidence concerning the quality and/or condition of the systems at\n\nthe time   of     conversion.      Because     of    these   evidentiary       gaps,\n\nLariviere contends, the court had no basis for concluding that the\n\nsystems had any value beyond their scrap value (established to be\n\napproximately $10,500) at the time they were converted.\n\n           Lariviere's appeal is built on too stingy a reading of\n\nthe record.      While it is true that the 1991 inventory provides the\n\nonly documentary evidence in the record concerning the number of\n\ncomponents in Gulf's truss assembly systems, there was no shortage\n\nof testimonial evidence on this issue.              This testimonial evidence,\n\nfound credible by the court, was sufficient to ground the judgment\n\nentered. See Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a) (factual determinations made at\n\na bench trial “shall not be set aside unless clearly erroneous”);\n\nUnited States v. 15 Bosworth St., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199222\"><a href=\"/opinion/199222/united-states-v-15-bosworth-street/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fIt was not clearly erroneous for the court to credit Anthony\n\nSarda's testimony that his 1998 recount confirmed that all of\n\nGulf's systems were still present on the property at that time.\n\nNor did the court clearly err in choosing to credit Nandy Sarda's\n\ntestimony that he did not observe any changes to the stacks of\n\nequipment during any of his visits to the plant throughout the\n\n1990s.    In sum, although Gulf did not provide the court with a\n\nwritten year 2000 inventory, there is no reason for us to question\n\nthe court's determination that the systems remained complete up\n\nuntil the time they were converted.\n\n           So too with the court's determination that the systems\n\nwere of marketable quality.     On this point, the court reasonably\n\ncredited testimony that Gulf stored the trusses in the customary\n\nmanner:    the steel trusses were treated with baked-on paint to\n\navoid rusting (the aluminum trusses were not painted because\n\naluminum does not rust) and were stacked on pallets to elevate them\n\nfrom the ground.   There was credible testimony that trusses are\n\ncustomarily stored outside because of their size and because the\n\nweather does not ordinarily affect their condition when they are\n\npainted and stacked properly.    The court also reasonably credited\n\nthe testimony of several witnesses, including the caretaker of the\n\npremises before Lariviere assumed the job in 1999, who testified\n\nthat the trusses (though not the accessories) appeared to be in\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fgood condition at various times as late as 1999.4      Although the\n\ncourt did conclude that the accessories had acquired significant\n\nrust due to improper storage, the court did not find that the\n\naccessories were non-functional.    Nor did the evidence compel such\n\na finding.    Thus, we see no clear error in the line that the court\n\nchose to draw:    that the systems were in marketable condition, but\n\nbecause the accessories (an important component of the systems)\n\nwere significantly rusted, only at a price at the lowest end of the\n\nrange in which systems of that age ordinarily sell.   See supra note\n\n3.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      These witnesses testified that, to the extent that rust was\nobserved on the trusses, it was only surface rust, which the court\nreasonably accepted as being insignificant to the trusses' value.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f</pre>",
