Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n              Campbell and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Robert E. Richardson, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     Judith H. Mizner for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           November 1, 2005\n\f              STAHL, Senior Circuit Judge.       At Omar Sharif McKoy’s\n\ntrial for cocaine possession, the district court granted McKoy’s\n\nmotion to suppress evidence found on his person during a pat-frisk\n\nsearch conducted by the police after McKoy was stopped for a\n\nparking violation.       The government appeals the order granting the\n\nmotion to suppress.      We affirm.\n\nI. Background\n\n              On a February afternoon in 2003, two plainclothes Boston\n\npolice officers were patrolling Boston’s Grove Hall neighborhood\n\nwhen they spotted a vehicle parked with its front end extending out\n\ninto an intersection.      The vehicle was blocking an access ramp for\n\nthe disabled and had a license place improperly displayed inside\n\nthe windshield. The officers testified that as they approached the\n\nvehicle, they made eye contact with the driver, McKoy, and then saw\n\nhim twice lean and move his arm toward the center console area of\n\nthe vehicle.       Suspecting McKoy might have been reaching for a\n\nweapon, one of the officers, Thomas Joyce, asked him to get out of\n\nthe car and began to pat-frisk him.         The frisk revealed marijuana\n\nin McKoy’s pocket, at which point Joyce arrested McKoy.           A further\n\nsearch   of    McKoy’s   person   eventually   recovered   5.63   grams   of\n\ncocaine, and he was ultimately charged with cocaine possession.\n\n              At trial, McKoy moved to suppress the evidence found\n\nduring the pat-frisk on the grounds that the frisk violated the\n\nFourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.          The District\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fCourt for the District of Massachusetts granted the motion, and the\n\ngovernment now appeals.\n\nII. Discussion\n\n           An officer may conduct a brief investigatory stop when he\n\nor she has a reasonable, articulable suspicion that criminal\n\nactivity is afoot.       Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 30 (1968); United\n\nStates v. Romain, 393 F.3d 63, 71 (1st Cir. 2004).                   After a valid\n\nTerry stop, a pat-frisk for weapons is also permissible where “the\n\nofficer is justified in believing that the person is armed and\n\ndangerous to the officer or others.”                   Romain, 393 F.3d at 71\n\n(quoting United States v. Schiavo, 29 F.3d 6,8 (1st Cir. 1994));\n\nTerry, 392 U.S. at 24.       It is insufficient that the stop itself is\n\nvalid; there must be a separate analysis of whether the standard\n\nfor   pat-frisks   has   been   met.         To   assess      the   legality    of   a\n\nprotective   frisk,      a   court     looks      at    the    totality    of    the\n\ncircumstances to see whether the officer had a particularized,\n\nobjective basis for his or her suspicion. United States v. Arvizu,\n\n534 U.S. 266, 273 (2002).\n\n      We review a district court’s findings of fact regarding a\n\nTerry stop and frisk for clear error and its legal conclusions de\n\nnovo.   United States v. Cruz, 156 F.3d 22, 26 (1st Cir. 1998).                  The\n\ndistrict court found that the two officers were justified in\n\ninitially stopping McKoy because they had probable cause to believe\n\nhe had committed two traffic violations.               This finding is clearly\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fcorrect.    Thus, our inquiry centers on the validity of the frisk:\n\nthat is, whether the totality of the circumstances provides a\n\nparticularized objective basis for the officers’ suspicion that\n\nMcKoy was dangerous and posed a threat to their safety.\n\n            The government relies on two factors as rationales for\n\nthe officers’ concern for their safety: (1) the dangerousness of\n\nthe neighborhood and (2) McKoy’s nervous appearance and movements\n\ninside     the    car.         Even   taken      together,    these   factors   are\n\ninsufficient to justify the frisk.\n\n            First,       the    district      court   found   that    the   officers\n\nbelieved the neighborhood where McKoy was parked to be a high-crime\n\narea, given that there had been two recent incidents of people\n\nshooting at the windows of private security vehicles. While police\n\nare permitted to take the character of a neighborhood into account\n\nwhen assessing whether a stop is appropriate, see United States v.\n\nStanley, 915 F.2d 54, 56 (1st Cir. 1990), it is only one factor\n\nthat must be looked at alongside all the other circumstances when\n\nassessing the reasonableness of the officers’ fear for their\n\nsafety.     Moreover, “[t]his is not a case where the police had\n\nreason to suspect the presence of firearms based on the type of\n\ncrime suspected.”         United States v. Lott, 870 F.2d 778, 785 (1st\n\nCir. 1989).      The only reason for the stop was a parking and license\n\nplate violation, from which no assumption about weapons may fairly\n\nbe drawn.        McKoy was the sole occupant of the vehicle and the\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fofficers made their approach during daylight hours.              The previous\n\ncriminal incidents in the neighborhood thus lend only weak support\n\nto the officers’ perception that McKoy was armed and dangerous.\n\n            Second, the government emphasizes that McKoy appeared\n\nnervous and avoided eye contact as the officers approached his car.\n\nMcKoy also leaned and reached to his right, toward the center\n\nconsole of the vehicle. The government argues that McKoy’s nervous\n\ndemeanor and his movements in the car are the kind of alarming\n\ngestures that have been cited by courts as justifying a protective\n\nsearch after a Terry stop. See, e.g., United States v. Moorefield,\n\n111 F.3d 10, 14 (3d Cir. 1997) (holding that police had reasonable\n\nsuspicion    to   pat-frisk     defendant    during    traffic      stop   where\n\ndefendant failed to keep his hands in view after being instructed\n\nto do so).    We disagree.\n\n            McKoy’s   claimed    nervous    manner    is   easily    explained.\n\nNervousness is a common and entirely natural reaction to police\n\npresence, and the district court found that McKoy knew he was\n\ndealing with police officers at least from the time the two\n\nofficers approached his car.1 Moreover, there was nothing sinister\n\nor menacing about McKoy’s reaching movement toward the center\n\nconsole.     Although it is possible that such a movement could be\n\nmade to get a weapon, the movement is also consistent with reaching\n\n1\n As the district court observed, if McKoy did not know the two\nmen approaching his car were police, there was arguably even more\nreason to be nervous and avoid eye contact.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\ffor a driver’s license or registration, a perfectly lawful action\n\nthat is to be expected when one is pulled over by the police.           The\n\ngovernment’s proposed standard comes too close to allowing an\n\nautomatic frisk of anyone who commits a traffic violation in a\n\nhigh-crime area.    Although “we cannot blind ourselves to the need\n\nfor law enforcement officers to protect themselves and other\n\nprospective victims of violence in situations where they may lack\n\nprobable cause for an arrest,” Terry, 392 U.S. at 24, a protective\n\nfrisk for weapons requires a reasonable inference that the person\n\nbeing searched is armed and dangerous.          Sibron v. New York, 392\n\nU.S. 40, 64 (1968).       It is simply not reasonable to infer that a\n\ndriver is armed and dangerous because the officers believe that he\n\nappears   nervous   and    reaches   toward    the   car’s   console   when\n\napproached by police, even in a high-crime neighborhood.\n\nIII. Conclusion\n\n           We fully recognize the risk of harm faced by police\n\nofficers at any traffic stop.          However, as the district court\n\nstated in its thoughtful opinion, “To admit the evidence would be\n\na legal determination that if one commits a traffic violation in a\n\nhigh-crime neighborhood he will be subject to a frisk whenever he\n\nappears   nervous   and    moves.”     Terry    does   not   require   that\n\ndetermination, and the Fourth Amendment prevents it.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f",

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1868</span></a></span>. It is insufficient that the stop itself is valid; there must be a separate analysis of whether the standard for pat-frisks has been met. To assess the legality of a protective frisk, a court looks at the totality of the circumstances to see whether the officer had a particularized, objective basis for his or her suspicion. <i>United States v. Arvizu,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118474\"><a href=\"/opinion/118474/united-states-v-arvizu/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">266</span></a></span>, 273, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118474\"><a href=\"/opinion/118474/united-states-v-arvizu/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">744</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118474\"><a href=\"/opinion/118474/united-states-v-arvizu/\"><span class=\"volume\">151</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">740</span></a></span> (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's findings of fact regarding a <i>Terry</i> stop and frisk for clear error and its legal conclusions de novo. <i>United States v. Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198094\"><a href=\"/opinion/198094/united-states-v-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir.1998). The district court found that the two officers were justified in initially stopping McKoy because they had probable cause to believe he had committed two traffic violations. This finding is clearly correct. Thus, our inquiry centers on the validity of the frisk: that is, whether the totality of the circumstances provides a particularized objective basis for the officers' suspicion that McKoy was dangerous and posed a threat to their safety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government relies on two factors as rationales for the officers' concern for their safety: (1) the dangerousness of the neighborhood and (2) McKoy's nervous appearance and movements inside the car. Even taken together, these factors are insufficient to justify the frisk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the district court found that the officers believed the neighborhood where McKoy was parked to be a high-crime area, given that there had been two recent incidents of people shooting at the windows of private security vehicles. While police are permitted to take the character of a neighborhood into account when assessing whether a stop is appropriate, <i>see United States v. Stanley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548685\"><a href=\"/opinion/548685/united-states-v-dennis-g-stanley/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span>, 56 (1st Cir.1990), it is only one factor that must be looked at alongside all the other circumstances when assessing the reasonableness of the officers' fear for their safety. Moreover, \"[t]his is not a case where the police had reason to suspect the presence of firearms based on the type of crime suspected.\" <i>United States v. Lott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520294\"><a href=\"/opinion/520294/united-states-v-george-e-lott-and-edward-turner/\"><span class=\"volume\">870</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></a></span>, 785 (1st Cir.1989). The only reason for the stop was a parking and license plate violation, from which no assumption about weapons may fairly be drawn. McKoy was the sole occupant of the vehicle and the officers made their approach during daylight hours. The previous criminal incidents in the neighborhood thus lend only weak support to the officers' perception that McKoy was armed and dangerous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the government emphasizes that McKoy appeared nervous and avoided eye contact as the officers approached his car. McKoy also leaned and reached to his right, toward the center console of the vehicle. The government argues that McKoy's nervous demeanor and his movements in the car are the kind of alarming gestures that have been cited by courts as justifying a protective search after a <i>Terry</i> stop. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Moorefield,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></span>, 14 (3d Cir.1997) (holding that police had reasonable suspicion to pat-frisk defendant during traffic stop where defendant failed to keep his hands in view after being instructed to do so). We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McKoy's claimed nervous manner is easily explained. Nervousness is a common and entirely natural reaction to police presence, and the district court found that McKoy knew he was dealing with police officers at least from the time the two officers approached his car.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Moreover, there was nothing sinister or menacing about McKoy's reaching movement toward the center console. Although it is possible that such a movement could be made to get a weapon, the movement is also consistent with reaching for a driver's license or registration, a perfectly lawful action that is to be expected when one is pulled over by the police. The government's proposed standard comes too close to allowing an automatic frisk of anyone who commits a traffic violation in a high-crime area. Although \"we cannot blind ourselves to the need for law enforcement officers to protect themselves and other prospective victims of violence in situations where they may lack probable cause for an arrest,\" <i>Terry,</i> 392 U.S. at 24, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107729\"><a href=\"/opinion/107729/terry-v-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1868</span></a></span>, a protective frisk for weapons requires a reasonable inference that the person being searched is armed and dangerous. <i>Sibron v. New York,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107730\"><a href=\"/opinion/107730/sibron-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 64, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107730\"><a href=\"/opinion/107730/sibron-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">88</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1889</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107730\"><a href=\"/opinion/107730/sibron-v-new-york/\"><span class=\"volume\">20</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">917</span></a></span> (1968). It is simply not reasonable to infer that a driver is armed and dangerous because the officers believe that he appears nervous and reaches toward the car's console when approached by police, even in a high-crime neighborhood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Conclusion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We fully recognize the risk of harm faced by police officers at any traffic stop. However, as the district court stated in its thoughtful opinion, \"To admit the evidence would be a legal determination that if one commits a traffic violation in a high-crime neighborhood he will be subject to a frisk whenever he appears nervous and moves.\" <i>Terry</i> does not require that determination, and the Fourth Amendment prevents it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> As the district court observed, if McKoy did not know the two men approaching his car were police, there was arguably even more reason to be nervous and avoid eye contact</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
