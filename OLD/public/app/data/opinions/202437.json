Plaintiffs Ezra Charitable Trust,\n\nMirror Management, Ltd., and Robert Bovit brought this action\n\npursuant to Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act\n\nof 1934, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78t(a), against defendants Tyco\n\nInternational,         Ltd.,   Edward    R.

The district\n\ncourt dismissed the action as to all defendants on the ground that\n\nthe amended class action complaint did not adequately allege\n\nscienter       under   the     Private   Securities      Litigation   Reform    Act\n\n(\"PSLRA\"), 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b), and plaintiffs appealed. We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                          I.\n\n               We present the facts as set forth in the amended class\n\naction complaint and the SEC filings relied upon in the complaint.\n\nSee Gross v. Summa Four, Inc., 93 F.3d 987, 991 & 994 n. 6 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n               The context of this action -- viz., the travails of Tyco\n\n-- is well-known.         Plaintiffs recount at some length the reported\n\nabuses    of    Tyco's    past    officers     and     directors,   notably   chief\n\nexecutive officer Dennis Kozlowski, chief financial officer Mark\n\nSwartz, chief corporate counsel Mark Belnick, and director Frank\n\nWalsh.    In 2002, as revelations of misconduct surfaced, there was\n\na major shake up at Tyco.            Tyco commissioned a massive internal\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\finvestigation led by the law firm of Boies Schiller & Flexner,\n\nwhich was aided by various accounting firms. All told, over 15,000\n\nattorney hours and 50,000 accountant hours were invested.1            As a\n\nconsequence, Tyco disclosed the alleged misconduct of its prior\n\nmanagement and made necessary accounting adjustments.          The changes\n\nwere costly, as Tyco's Form 10-K report for fiscal 2002 showed a\n\nnet loss of over nine billion dollars, a stark contrast from its\n\nnearly four billion dollars of profit in fiscal year 2001, and over\n\nfour and a half billion dollars profit in fiscal year 2000.             As\n\npart of Tyco's clean-up, new senior officers and directors were\n\nappointed.     Breen was made the chief executive officer in July\n\n2002, and Fitzpatrick was made the chief financial officer in\n\nSeptember 2002.\n\n             Plaintiffs' action focuses on the initial results of the\n\nclean-up, spanning the period between December 30, 2002 and March\n\n12, 2003.2     Plaintiffs allege that the clean-up fell well short of\n\nsanitizing Tyco's books, and that new management perpetuated a\n\nfraud   in    the   accounting   for     ADT,   one   of   Tyco's   largest\n\nsubsidiaries.\n\n\n\n1\n  The scope of the investigation was broad, and included the\nintegrity of the company's financial statements, the possible\nexistence of systemic fraud, and corporate governance issues. The\ninvestigation yielded numerous recommendations regarding Tyco's\naccounting and corporate governance practices.\n2\n  The misconduct during the prior period is the subject of other,\nongoing class-action law suits.\n\n                                   -3-\n\f             Plaintiffs     allege   that     ADT,    a   provider   of    security\n\nsystems, purchased customer contracts from its authorized dealers\n\nand accounted for the transactions in the following improper\n\nmanner.      First, ADT would ostensibly agree to purchase a customer\n\ncontract from a dealer for $1000.                    Second, the dealer would\n\nostensibly     agree   to   pay   ADT   $200   as     reimbursement       for   ADT's\n\nexpenses in connection with acquiring the contract (the \"connection\n\nfee\").    Third, ADT would remit the $800 net amount to the dealer\n\n(the only cash that changed hands), record the acquisition of the\n\ncontract at the full price of $1000, and record a $200 expense\n\noffset (income).       Significantly, ADT's actual expenses related to\n\neach contract were de minimis - $5 for a credit check - and ADT\n\nrecorded the difference ($195) as income. Plaintiffs allege that\n\nthis   was    \"Alice   in   Wonderland\"       accounting     because      Generally\n\nAccepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") require that intangible\n\nassets such as these contracts be recorded at their actual cost\n\n(here $805), and because no income is to be recognized under such\n\ncircumstances.     Thus, according to plaintiffs, these transactions\n\npermitted Tyco/ADT to fraudulently overstate ADT's income and\n\nassets.\n\n             Plaintiffs allege that the defendants made actionable\n\nmisrepresentations in connection with these transactions.                       First,\n\nin its 12/30/02 Form 8-K filed with the SEC, Tyco's management\n\ndisclosed the results of the internal investigation and stated that\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fTyco was \"not aware of any systemic or significant fraud related to\n\nthe Company's financial statements or of any clear accounting\n\nerrors    that     would    materially     adversely   affect   the    Company's\n\nreported earnings or cash flow from operations for the year 2003\n\nand thereafter.\"           The Form 8-K also purported to correct ADT's\n\naccounting, noting that to the extent the connection fee exceeded\n\nactual    costs,    it     \"should   be   deferred   and   amortized   over    the\n\nestimated useful life of an acquired customer relationship\" (ten\n\nyears). As a consequence, the Form 8-K reported that 2002 earnings\n\nwould be reduced by $135 million, and that a $185.9 million charge\n\nto earnings would be taken to adjust income improperly recognized\n\nin fiscal years 1999 to 2001 (a $320.9 million adjustment in all).\n\nTyco's Form 10-K, filed on 12/30/02, largely echoed the Form 8-K's\n\nrepresentations.         Notably, it stated that \"new senior management\n\nhas no reason to believe that the financial statements included in\n\nthis report are not fairly stated in all material respects.\"               As to\n\nADT's contract acquisitions, the Form 10-K noted that fees received\n\nfrom   dealers,     in     excess    of   actual   costs   incurred,   would    be\n\namortized over ten years as a \"deferred credit.\"                 The 10-K also\n\nincluded PwC's audit opinion, dated December 23, 2002, which\n\nstated:\n\n                    In   our   opinion,   the   accompanying\n            consolidated    balance   sheets   and   related\n            consolidated statements of operations, of\n            shareholders' equity and of cash flows present\n            fairly,    in   all   material   respects,   the\n            financial position of Tyco International, Ltd.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f            and its subsidiaries at September 30, 2002 and\n            2001, and the results of their operations and\n            their cash flows for each of the three years\n            in the period ended September 30, 2002, in\n            conformity    with    accounting    principles\n            generally accepted in the United States of\n            America . . . . We conducted our audits of\n            these statements in accordance with auditing\n            standards generally accepted in the United\n            States of America . . . .\n\n\n            Plaintiffs assert that these releases contained four\n\nfraudulent misstatements by the Tyco defendants: (1) that Tyco's\n\naccounting had been corrected; (2) that the financial statements\n\nfairly presented Tyco's status; (3) that all material accounting\n\nissues, particularly those involving ADT, had been corrected; and\n\n(4) that ADT would receive a $320.9 million revenue stream over the\n\nnext ten years.     Plaintiffs maintain that these representations\n\nwere false because there were still major problems in ADT's books,\n\nnotably that the income recognized from dealer \"connection fees\" to\n\nADT was \"imaginary,\" and that the contracts acquired were being\n\nrecorded at an artificially inflated cost.      Plaintiffs assert that\n\nthe defendants corrected only a technical, inconsequential error --\n\nthat the \"imaginary\" income was being recognized too quickly\n\n(immediately rather than over the life of the contract) -- in their\n\ninitial   restatement,   but   knowingly   permitted   more   significant\n\nerrors --   the improper recognition of income and the inflation of\n\nasset value -- to remain unaltered.        Plaintiffs also allege that\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fPwC, knowing of the errors in ADT's books, nonetheless wrongfully\n\nissued a \"clean\" audit opinion.\n\n            Plaintiffs allege that the fraud was brought to light in\n\nMarch 2003, when Tyco essentially admitted the fraud in a press\n\nrelease and subsequent Form 10-Q.             In a March 12, 2003 press\n\nrelease, Tyco stated that, pursuant to ongoing discussions with the\n\nSEC, it expected \"to take non-cash, pre-tax charges between $265\n\nmillion and $325 million for issues identified primarily in [ADT].\"\n\nTyco also announced that the president of ADT, Jerry Boggess, and\n\nother senior ADT managers, had been fired.                Tyco stock dropped\n\nsignificantly     on   the    news.      Plaintiffs     say   that    defendants\n\nacknowledged in their 3/31/03 Form 10-Q that they had been in\n\nongoing discussions with the SEC about their accounting for the\n\ndealer   fees   and    were   changing   their     accounting   for    the   non-\n\nrefundable dealer charges to treat them properly as a reduction in\n\nADT's costs in acquiring the contracts.3\n\n            Plaintiffs also allege that Tyco falsely attributed the\n\nMarch    2003   accounting    corrections     to    a   then-recently     issued\n\naccounting requirement from the Financial Accounting Standards\n\nBoard's Emerging Issues Task Force (\"EITF\") -- EITF 02-16 -- which\n\nhad nothing to do with the relevant accounting issue.                 Plaintiffs\n\n\n\n3\n  Plaintiffs also note that the Form 10-Q announced over $900\nmillion in additional charges to earnings to correct various\naccounting problems unearthed by \"intensified . . . internal audits\nand detailed controls and operating reviews . . . .\"\n\n                                      -7-\n\fassert that the proper accounting principle is and was located in\n\nAccounting Research Bulletin (\"ARB\") 43, which has been in effect\n\nsince 1953.\n\n          Plaintiffs also emphasize the actions of PwC's audit\n\nengagement partner for Tyco, Richard Scalzo.      The SEC, in an\n\nAccounting and Auditing Enforcement Action dated August 13, 2003,\n\nbarred Scalzo from practicing accounting before it based on its\n\nfinding that Scalzo had violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 and\n\ncommitted improper professional conduct in connection with his\n\naudits of Tyco for fiscal years 1997-2001.   See 2003 WL 21938985\n\n(SEC Release No. 1839). Essentially, the SEC concluded that Scalzo\n\nwas on notice of prior management's misconduct, failed to take the\n\nnecessary steps required by Generally Accepted Auditing Standards\n\n(\"GAAS\"), and recklessly permitted PwC to issue audit reports\n\nstating that Tyco's books had been audited according to GAAS.\n\n          Plaintiffs assert that the Tyco defendants had two basic\n\nmotivations for the alleged fraud. First, they wished to keep Tyco\n\nviable as a going concern.   Plaintiffs allege that Tyco had over\n\nfour billion dollars in debt coming due in early 2003, and faced\n\nimminent bankruptcy if it failed to meet these obligations.   Their\n\ntheory is that management misstated ADT's accounting to give the\n\nfalse impression that Tyco had a $320.9 million revenue stream,\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fwhich permitted Tyco to obtain crucial financing.4        Second, they\n\nwanted to preserve their own lucrative positions, which included\n\nlarge salaries, bonuses, and stock options. Plaintiffs allege that\n\nthe Tyco defendants highlighted their deceit by providing false\n\nexplanations for the belated correction.\n\n            As to PwC, plaintiffs allege that PwC's audit opinion was\n\nfraudulent because PwC knowingly failed to comply with GAAS and was\n\naware that Tyco's accounting was not in compliance with GAAP.\n\nPlaintiffs state that PwC's motive was straightforward. PwC looked\n\nthe other way on Tyco's new fraud, just as it allegedly had with\n\npast frauds, to preserve its lucrative business relationship with\n\nTyco.\n\n            The district court dismissed the complaint, concluding\n\nthat    scienter   was   inadequately    alleged.   As   to   Breen   and\n\nFitzpatrick, the court concluded that their financial stake in\n\nTyco's continued viability was inadequate, standing alone, to\n\ncreate a strong inference of scienter, and that the balance of the\n\nallegations amounted to nothing more than \"fraud by hindsight,\" as\n\nthere was no basis for concluding that Breen and Fitzgerald knew\n\nthe disputed representations were false when made.       The court also\n\nheld that, because Tyco's liability was solely derivative of\n\n\n\n4\n Plaintiffs note that the Tyco defendants did not fully correct\nADT's accounting until after Tyco had successfully placed an over\nfour billion dollar bond offering and obtained a one and a half\nbillion dollar line of credit.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fBreen's and Fitzpatrick's, the claims against the corporate entity\n\nshould be dismissed.       Finally, the court concluded that PwC's\n\nfinancial stake in its continued business relationship with Tyco\n\nwas inadequate to create a strong inference of scienter, and that\n\nthe remaining allegations were either too vague or pertained only\n\nto conduct outside the class period.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            Plaintiffs   argue   that     the   district    court    erred   in\n\nevaluating in isolation their allegations of scienter on the part\n\nof   the   Tyco   defendants   rather   than    assessing   the     collective\n\npicture.    They further contend that the court erred in failing to\n\nappreciate the import of the alleged GAAP and GAAS violations that\n\nPwC countenanced, as well as the relevance of PwC's past misconduct\n\nin auditing Tyco.\n\n            We review the allowance of the defendants' motions to\n\ndismiss de novo.      Aldridge v. A.T. Cross Corp., 284 F.3d 72, 78\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).     In reviewing a motion to dismiss, we take as true\n\nall well-pleaded allegations and draw all reasonable inferences in\n\nthe plaintiff's favor; however, we are free to \"disregard bald\n\nassertions, unsupportable conclusions, and opprobrious epithets.\"\n\nIn re Credit Suisse First Boston Corp., 431 F.3d 36, 45 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).     Moreover, we \"may affirm on any independently sufficient\n\nground.\"     Badillo-Santiago v. Naveira-Merly, 378 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f             In general, a securities fraud claim has six elements:\n\n(1) a material misrepresentation or omission; (2) scienter; (3)\n\nconnection with the purchase or sale of a security; (4) reliance;\n\n(5) economic loss; and (6) loss causation.                   Dura Pharma., Inc. v.\n\nBroudo, 544 U.S. 336, 341-42 (2005).                    Our focus here is on the\n\nadequacy of plaintiffs' allegations of scienter.                           Scienter is\n\ndefined as \"a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate,\n\nor     defraud,\"     and    a    plaintiff      must      allege    that   \"defendants\n\nconsciously intended to defraud, or that they acted with a high\n\ndegree of recklessness.\"            Aldridge, 284 F.3d at 82.\n\n             Under    the       PSLRA,   the    complaint      must    first   provide\n\ndetailed     pleading       about    each      of   the    statements      challenged,\n\nincluding     factual      allegations       illustrating          precisely   why   the\n\nchallenged statement is misleading. Greebel v. FTP Software, Inc.,\n\n194 F.3d 185, 193-94 (1st Cir. 1999).5                 The PSLRA also requires the\n\ncomplaint to plead particular facts that give rise to a strong\n\n(rather than merely reasonable) inference of scienter.6                              This\n\n\n5\n     The PSLRA provides:\n\n        [T]he complaint shall specify each statement alleged to\n        have been misleading, the reason or reasons why the\n        statement is misleading, and, if an allegation is made on\n        information and belief, the complaint shall state with\n        particularity all facts on which that belief is formed.\n\n15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(1).\n\n6\n    As to scienter, the PSLRA states:\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\falters the usual Rule 12(b)(6) standard, in that while the \"court\n\ncontinues to give all reasonable inferences to plaintiffs, those\n\ninferences     supporting    scienter      must   be   strong   ones.\"       In   re\n\nCabletron Sys., Inc.,        311 F.3d 11, 28 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n              \"We have interpreted [the PSLRA scienter] provision as\n\ndemanding a recitation of facts supporting a 'highly likely'\n\ninference that the defendant acted with the required state of\n\nmind.\"     In re Stone & Webster, Inc., Sec.

In making this assessment, we have eschewed any\n\nreliance on a rigid pleading formula, instead \"preferring to rely\n\non   a    'fact-specific    approach'      that   proceeds      case   by   case.\"\n\nCabletron, 311 F.3d at 38.           \"Scienter allegations do not pass the\n\n'strong inference' test when, viewed in light of the complaint as\n\na whole, there are legitimate explanations for the behavior that\n\nare equally convincing.\"          Credit Suisse, 431 F.3d at 49; see also\n\nAldridge, 284 F.3d at 82 (\"The plaintiff must show that his\n\ncharacterization      of    the   events    and   circumstances        as   showing\n\nscienter is highly likely.\").

Tyco defendants\n\n            As to the Tyco defendants, the plaintiffs argue that\n\nseveral factors which, taken together, establish scienter: (1) the\n\nsignificant GAAP violation in ADT's accounting; (2) defendants'\n\nfalse exculpatory statement that the March restatement was mandated\n\nby   EITF   02-16;   (3)   the    close    proximity   between     the   March\n\nrestatement   and    the   purported      December   2002   correction;     (4)\n\ndefendants' knowledge of Kozlowski's relationship with Boggess and\n\nADT; and (5) defendants' desire to save Tyco and maintain their\n\nlucrative positions. We conclude that the district court correctly\n\ndismissed the claims.\n\n            We begin with context.         The plaintiffs assert that the\n\ndistrict court failed to view their allegations in their entirety.\n\nBut we think it is the plaintiffs who are being myopic.            Plaintiffs\n\npay too little heed to the circumstances in which the alleged fraud\n\nwas taking place:     Tyco had new management, was in the midst of a\n\nmassive clean-up of fraud, and had disclosed the wrongdoing of\n\nprior management.      We think that it is important to bear this\n\ncontext in mind as we evaluate plaintiffs' claims.\n\n            Tyco's   statements    were     not   nearly    so   absolute    as\n\nplaintiffs present them. For example, the statement in the Form 8-\n\nK that management was currently unaware of systemic fraud was made\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fin the context the Form 8-K's recounting of the investigation,\n\nprior   management's   transgressions,   and   the   impossibility   of\n\ncorrecting all errors:\n\n                   Few, if any, major companies have ever\n           been subjected to the corporate governance and\n           accounting scrutiny entailed in Phase 2 of the\n           Boies Firm's work.       However, despite the\n           extent of the Boies Firm's work, the Company\n           has not sought to go back and identify every\n           accounting decision and every corporate act\n           over a multi-year period that was wrong or\n           questionable,    or   whether   there    was   a\n           preferable accounting treatment among the\n           alternative treatments available under [GAAP].\n           Given the size and scope of the Company's\n           operations,    such   a   task,   or    anything\n           approaching it, would have been impossible\n           within any plausible time-frame. Moreover, in\n           part   because   of   the   passage   of   time,\n           documentation was not always available; the\n           documentation that was available was often\n           dispersed; and neither the Boies Firm nor the\n           Company had the benefit of information from\n           prior senior management of Tyco because the\n           former    Chief   Executive    Officer,    Chief\n           Financial Officer, and Chief Corporate Counsel\n           have all been under criminal indictment during\n           the course of this review and analysis. All\n           of these factors, as well as the Company's\n           past failure to document many decisions\n           contemporaneously, would have limited the\n           conclusions that could have been drawn\n           concerning individual accounting treatments in\n           any event.      Nonetheless, for the actual\n           purposes of the work, as discussed above, the\n           Company believes that the scope and detail of\n           the   review,   and   the   documentation    and\n           information available, was sufficient to reach\n           the conclusions discussed below.\n\n                  The Company is not aware of any\n           systemic or significant fraud related to the\n           Company's financial statements or of any clear\n           accounting   errors  that   would   materially\n           adversely   affect  the   Company's   reported\n\n                                -14-\n\f          earnings or cash flow from operations for the\n          year 2003 and thereafter.          However, as\n          discussed    below,   certain    instances    of\n          erroneous   accounting    entries    have   been\n          identified and corrected.         In addition,\n          current management has concluded that, in the\n          past, the Company in general suffered from\n          poor documentation; inadequate policies and\n          procedures to prevent the misconduct of senior\n          executives     that    occurred;      inadequate\n          procedures       for     proper       corporate\n          authorizations; inadequate approval procedures\n          and documentation; a lack of oversight by\n          senior management at the corporate level; a\n          pattern of using aggressive accounting that,\n          even when not erroneous, was undertaken with\n          the purpose and effect of increasing reported\n          results above what they would have been if\n          more   conservative   accounting    were   used;\n          pressure on, and inducements to, segment and\n          unit managers to increase current earnings,\n          including by decisions as to what accounting\n          treatment to employ; and a lack of stated and\n          demonstrable commitment by former         senior\n          corporate   management   to   set    appropriate\n          standards of ethics, integrity, accounting,\n          and corporate governance. . . .\n\n          Similarly,   the   Form   10-K's   representation   that   new\n\nmanagement believed the financial statements were fairly stated\n\nincluded the caveat:\n\n          There can be no assurances, however, that new\n          problems will not be found in the future. We\n          expect to continue to improve our controls\n          with each passing quarter. It will take some\n          time, however, before we have in place the\n          rigorous controls that our Board of Directors\n          and new senior management desire and our\n          shareholders deserve.\n\n          The Form 10-K sounded other cautionary notes as well.\n\nUnder \"risk factors,\" in addition to cautioning that continuing\n\nnegative publicity and pending litigation could have a substantial\n\n                                -15-\n\fnegative impact on Tyco, the Form 10-K warned that more bad news\n\ncould be on the horizon:\n\n                  We and others have received various\n          subpoenas and requests from the SEC, the\n          District Attorney of New York, and the U.S.\n          Attorney for the District of New Hampshire and\n          others seeking the production of voluminous\n          documents    in   connection     with   various\n          investigations      into    our     governance,\n          management, operations, accounting and related\n          controls.     We cannot predict when these\n          investigations will be completed, nor can we\n          predict    what    the    results    of   these\n          investigations may be. It is possible that we\n          will be required to pay material fines,\n          consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose\n          the   ability   to    conduct   business   with\n          government instrumentalities or suffer other\n          penalties, each of which could have a material\n          adverse effect on our business....\n\n          Perhaps     most    significantly,      the    Form    10-K    also\n\nspecifically cautioned about on-going review by the SEC:\n\n                 As of the filing date of this Form 10-\n          K, we continue to be engaged in a dialogue\n          with the SEC's Division of Corporation\n          Finance, as part of a routine review of our\n          periodic filings.   While we believe that we\n          have resolved the material accounting issues\n          prior to filings there can be no assurance\n          that the resolution of the remaining comments\n          issued by the Staff will not necessitate one\n          or more amendments to this or prior periodic\n          reports.\n\nEssentially, the warned-of hazard came to pass regarding ADT's\n\ncontract accounting.       See Financial Acquisition Partners LP v.\n\nBlackwell,   440   F.3d   278,   288-89   (5th   Cir.   2006)   (\"what   [the\n\ncompany] warned might happen, did indeed happen\"). All told, these\n\ncautionary statements are far more concrete, in light of Tyco's\n\n                                   -16-\n\fcircumstances, than vague \"boilerplate\" warnings.          Compare Plotkin\n\nv. IP Axess Inc., 407 F.3d 690, 697 (5th Cir. 2005).            Moreover,\n\nattempts to provide investors with warnings of risks generally\n\nweaken the inference of scienter. See Geffon v. Micrion Corp., 249\n\nF.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir. 2001).           From this context, we proceed to\n\nplaintiffs' specific allegations.\n\n            As to GAAP violations, there is nothing in the complaint\n\nsupporting an inference that Breen or Fitzgerald were directly\n\ninvolved in these detailed accounting matters or had knowledge of\n\ntheir alleged falsity.           See Stone & Webster, 414 F.3d at 199\n\n(nothing supporting inference that senior officers were involved in\n\ndetails of accounting).           While Fitzgerald, as chief financial\n\nofficer, might be expected to have some general supervisory role\n\nover the accounting issues, he appeared on the scene only weeks\n\nbefore the Form 8-K was prepared, and there is no indication that\n\nhe   was   aware    of   any   impropriety.    See   id.    Moreover,   the\n\nrepresentations in Tyco's filings were, in essence, estimations of\n\nwhether the books still contained significant errors.         Plaintiffs'\n\nallegations fall short of establishing that these estimations were\n\nunreasonable in light of the massive internal investigation.            See\n\nid. at 201.        In sum, there are no alleged facts that strongly\n\nsuggest that the defendants knew any of the challenged statements\n\nwere false when made.          See Credit Suisse, 431 F.3d at 49-50; see\n\nalso Blackwell, 440 F.3d at 289 (no factual allegations supporting\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\finference that individual defendants knew true value of assets or\n\nthat discount rate or credit-loss assumption was improper).\n\n           Plaintiffs' reliance on the defendants' allegedly false\n\nattribution of the restatement to EITF 02-16 is similarly flawed.\n\nObviously, evidence of conscious wrongdoing may be shown by facts\n\ndemonstrating concealment.    See generally Cabletron, 311 F.3d at\n\n39.   But the allegations fall short again here.   There is simply no\n\nbasis for concluding that the individual defendants were involved\n\nin or had personal knowledge of this detailed accounting issue.\n\nSee Stone & Webster, 414 F.3d at 199.\n\n           Plaintiffs are correct that a short time period between\n\nan alleged misstatement and a later disclosure of inconsistent\n\ninformation may be relevant to the question of scienter.    See Shaw\n\nv. Digital Equip. Corp., 82 F.3d 1194, 1225 (1st Cir. 1996).      In\n\nthis case, however, the timing of the correction has limited\n\nprobative value, as the change appears to have been prompted by\n\nSEC's Division of Corporation Finance.7      The simple fact of a\n\n\n7\n Plaintiffs have moved the court to take judicial notice of the\nSEC's 2006 complaint against Tyco in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York, the subsequent consent\ndecree, and the final judgment entered against Tyco (collectively\nthe \"Consent Decree\"). In the Consent Decree, Tyco agreed to pay a\n50 million dollar civil fine and not to contest, inter alia, that\nADT's contract accounting was wrongful. We grant the motion.\n      We note that the SEC describes ADT's accounting practices\nsomewhat differently than do the plaintiffs. According to the SEC,\nin 1997, Tyco began charging dealers a $200 connection fee when ADT\npurchased their contracts while simultaneously increasing the price\nADT paid to the dealers by $200 (from $800 to $1000). Tyco then\nclassified this premium \"paid\" to the dealers a \"growth bonus.\"\n\n                                -18-\n\fcorrection is also not particularly probative; \"[p]laintiffs may\n\nnot simply seize upon disclosures made later and allege that they\n\nshould have been made earlier.\"   Cabletron, 311 F.3d at 37.\n\n          That the defendants were generally aware of Kozlowski's\n\nrelationship with Boggess also does not suffice.   It is ordinarily\n\nnot sufficient to conclusorily allege \"an overarching fraudulent\n\nscheme or corrupt environment.\"    Credit Suisse, 431 F.3d at 49.\n\nSimilarly, that there had been issues with ADT is not enough.\n\n\"Fraud cannot be inferred simply because [a parent corporation]\n\nmight have been more curious or concerned about the activity at [a\n\nsubsidiary].\"   Chill v. Gen. Elec. Co., 101 F.3d 263, 270 (2d Cir.\n\n1996).   Moreover, plaintiffs fail to account for both Breen's and\n\nFitzgerald's general unfamiliarity with Tyco.8 Indeed, the fact of\n\n\nThe $200 connection fee was immediately recognized as income, but\nthe offsetting $200 growth bonus was amortized over 10 years.\nBecause the connection fee and growth bonus cancelled each other\nout, they did not alter the economic substance of the contract\nacquisition, should not have been recognized under GAAP, and\nsignificantly inflated Tyco's income and cash flow. The SEC noted\nthat Tyco terminated the connection fee and restated its operating\nincome and cash flow in 2003 as a result of a review by the SEC's\nDivision of Corporation Finance.\n     Plaintiffs assert that the SEC action validates their claims,\nas the SEC found the same conduct that plaintiffs challenge to be\nwrongful under the securities laws. However, the Consent Decree,\nin addition to being three years after the fact, is of very limited\nrelevance. That the SEC concluded that an ADT accounting practice,\nadopted in 1997 by past Tyco officers, was wrongful, adds little to\ncreating a strong inference of scienter on the part of current Tyco\nofficers.\n8\n Interestingly, Tyco noted the presence of new management\nunfamiliar with Tyco in the midst of a clean up as a \"Risk Factor\"\nin its Form 10-K:\n\n                               -19-\n\fBreen's and Fitzpatrick's recent arrivals, and consequent lack of\n\ninvolvement   in   past   dubious     decisions,   undermines   most   of\n\nplaintiffs' allegations.\n\n           This brings us to plaintiffs' allegations of motive and\n\nopportunity. \"'[C]atch-all allegations' which merely assert motive\n\nand opportunity, without something more, fail to satisfy the\n\nPSLRA.\"   Cabletron, 311 F.3d at 39.       The question becomes whether\n\nplaintiffs have alleged \"more than the usual concern by executives\n\nto improve financial results.\"       Id.\n\n            The key motivation alleged is Breen's and Fitzgerald's\n\ndesperation to save Tyco from bankruptcy. Plaintiffs rely on three\n\n\n\n          In the past few months, we have replaced our senior\n     management with entirely new members and our entire board\n     of directors determined not to stand for reelection at\n     our next annual general meeting of shareholders. It will\n     take some time for our new management team and our new\n     board of directors to learn our various businesses and to\n     develop strong working relationships with our cadre of\n     operating managers at our various subsidiary companies.\n     Our new senior management team's ability to complete this\n     process is hindered by their need to spend significant\n     time and effort dealing with internal and external\n     investigations, developing effective corporate governance\n     procedures, strengthening reporting lines and reviewing\n     internal controls. During this period and in order to\n     complete the process, our new executives will be in part\n     dependent   on   advisors,   including   certain   former\n     directors.     We cannot assure you that this major\n     restructuring of our board of directors and senior\n     management team will not adversely affect our results of\n     operations, at least in the near term, especially in\n     light of the significant attention they are required to\n     devote to such other matters.\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\ffactual allegations to support the inference that Tyco faced\n\nimminent bankruptcy: (1) that Tyco had to repay or refinance nearly\n\nfour billion dollars in debt in February 2003; (2) that Breen\n\nacknowledged that Tyco faced a liquidity gap in 2003 if it failed\n\nto obtain a one and a half billion dollar line of credit; and (3)\n\nthat some suppliers had requested letters of credit from Tyco.\n\nThese allegations are rather limited and conclusory, particularly\n\nwhen set against Tyco's enormous assets (well over sixty billion\n\ndollars worth, per the Form 10-K), significant shareholder equity\n\n(over twenty-five billion dollars), and          substantial going-concern\n\nvalue   (despite    significant    continued     write-downs,      Tyco   earned\n\napproximately a billion dollars in 2003 and its earnings have\n\nclimbed steadily since then).          This collection of facts does not\n\nsupport a strong inference of imminent bankruptcy.              Cf. Baron v.\n\nSmith, 380 F.3d 49, 57 (1st Cir. 2004)(an event of default is\n\ndifferent from an actual default).\n\n              Further, this case is different from those relied upon by\n\nthe plaintiffs.      Here, the defendants were not acting to conceal\n\ntheir   own    errors   or   justify    their   past   strategic    decisions.\n\nCompare Cabletron, 311 F.3d at 38-39; Aldridge, 284 F.3d at 83-84.\n\nIn addition, the defendants' compensation appears to be largely\n\n\"up-front\" or otherwise guaranteed, perhaps as an acknowledgment of\n\nrisk.    As to their stock options, it is not at all clear why\n\ndefendants would prefer postponing profit reducing and stock price\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\freducing write-downs to future years (when their options would have\n\nvested) to swallowing the entire bitter pill in 2002.\n\n            The dueling inferences, taken as wholes, break down as\n\nfollows.    Did the defendants, brought in to clean up a massive and\n\nwell-publicized       fraud   and    actively   scrutinized   by    the   SEC,\n\nfinancial    media,    and    bar,   fraudulently   commit    an   accounting\n\nviolation (and fully document their fraud in Tyco's SEC filings) to\n\nbriefly delay recognition of an additional write-down in the ADT\n\nbooks and present the illusion of a limited9 additional revenue\n\nstream to obtain needed financing, only to reveal their wrongdoing\n\nto all concerned (including their new creditors) in a subsequent\n\nfiling to the SEC shortly thereafter?           Or did the new management,\n\nhaving been advised by an internal investigation of errors in ADT's\n\naccounting that required a 320 million dollar adjustment, believe\n\ntheir job was done as to that subsidiary (one of approximately\n\n2300), only to subsequently discover (with the SEC's assistance)\n\nthat ADT's books had more mischief to address than first realized?\n\nUnder all the facts and circumstances alleged, the second inference\n\nis at least as strong as the first and thus dooms plaintiffs'\n\nclaims.    See Credit Suisse, 431 F.3d at 49.\n\n\n\n\n9\n  A 320 million dollar income stream to be recognized over ten\nyears (or 32 million dollars a year) would appear to be of limited\nconsequence in obtaining over four billion dollars in loans and\nover an additional billion and a half dollars in credit, while\nsimultaneously recognizing a nine billion dollar loss.\n\n                                      -22-\n\fB. PwC\n\n             Plaintiffs   emphasize    the       following     allegations      as\n\ndemonstrating PwC's scienter: (1) that the initial restatement of\n\nthe ADT books in 2002 was an \"obvious\" GAAP violation that resulted\n\nin a significant second restatement less than three months later;\n\n(2) that PwC committed a host of GAAS violations in connection with\n\nits 2002 audit; (3) that Scalzo was intimately involved in the\n\ncreation of the 2002 financial statements; (4) that PwC was well\n\naware of prior bad acts by Tyco's former management and ignored the\n\nnumerous \"red flags\" implicated by those acts; and (5) that PwC had\n\nan    enormous   financial   incentive      to   keep   Tyco    as    a    client.\n\nPlaintiffs stress that PwC specifically reaffirmed the validity of\n\nthe 2001 financial statements in its 2002 audit opinion, rendering\n\nthe prior misconduct relevant to the instant action.                      We again\n\nconclude that the district court reached the correct result.\n\n             We first note, as did the district court, that plaintiffs\n\nattempt to muddy the waters with their emphasis on 2001.                  The only\n\nrepresentations made by PwC challenged by plaintiffs in this action\n\nare contained within PwC's 2002 audit opinion letter.                 While the\n\n2002 audit opinion makes a passing reference to 2001, the fact\n\nremains that plaintiffs' action targets representations, made at\n\nthe close of 2002, regarding ADT's contract acquisition accounting.\n\nPlaintiffs have shown no connection between their current action\n\nand    any   representations   in     the    2001    financial       statements.\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fMoreover, the prior misconduct relating to prior years' financial\n\nstatements had been disclosed in Tyco's 2002 filings.                     As before,\n\nplaintiffs have overlooked the most important circumstances of the\n\ncase:     that     new    management   had    been    appointed     and    Tyco   was\n\nattempting to clean up its operations.\n\n               For that reason, plaintiffs' reliance on Scalzo's conduct\n\nis unavailing.           Indeed, the SEC's ruling banning Scalzo from\n\npracticing      accountancy    before    it    specifically       refers     to   his\n\nwrongful conduct in the 1997 through 2001 fiscal years.                        While\n\nplaintiffs assert that Scalzo was still assigned to Tyco in 2002,\n\nthe climate had changed.          Given the internal investigation, new\n\nmanagement, massive restatements, and public scrutiny, it is not a\n\nlikely inference, based upon the factual allegations, that Scalzo\n\n(to whatever extent that he remained involved) was still engaged in\n\nthe same wrongful conduct.         And in any event, plaintiffs fail to\n\nprovide any specific allegations regarding Scalzo's involvement in\n\nthe     2002     financial    statements.            Furthermore,     plaintiffs'\n\nallegations that PwC disregarded various \"red flags,\" based upon\n\nits detailed knowledge of past misdeeds, is unavailing. Correcting\n\nthe past misstatements was the focus of the new management and the\n\ninternal investigation.         Significantly, the SEC's ruling banning\n\nScalzo does not mention the dealer accounting issue at ADT (or\n\nanything like it), making it questionable whether PwC would have\n\nbeen aware of difficulties there.            The presence of \"red flags\" not\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\facted upon by an auditor is not sufficient to raise a strong\n\ninference of scienter if there are no facts showing that the\n\nauditor knew (or willfully blinded itself to the knowledge) that\n\nthe underlying facts, if properly accounted for, would result in\n\nsignificant changes to audited financial statements.                    See Fidel v.\n\nFarley, 392 F.3d 220, 229 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\n            Having     cleared     the    underbrush,    we     now     examine    the\n\nplaintiffs' remaining allegations against PwC.                 We start with the\n\nalleged GAAP violation. \"Merely stating in conclusory fashion that\n\na company's books are out of compliance with GAAP would not itself\n\ndemonstrate      liability     under     section      10(b)    or     Rule   10b-5.\"\n\nCabletron, 311 F.3d at 34.          Moreover, the circumstances are more\n\ncomplex than plaintiffs indicate -- that intangible assets like the\n\ncontracts are recorded at actual cost pursuant to ARB 43.                          One\n\ncomplication, as plaintiffs concede, is that \"ARB 43\" has no\n\nrelevance   to    this    issue,    as    it    was   superceded      long   ago   by\n\nAccounting Principles Board Opinion 17 and Financial Accounting\n\nStandards Board Opinion 147 (although plaintiffs maintain that the\n\nunderlying principle has remained the same).                  Another is that the\n\nADT contract acquisitions also included a connection fee (and a\n\ngrowth   bonus    in     the   SEC's     description).          These    additional\n\ntransactions make the accounting issue more complex, as ADT's\n\nrecords create the impression that ADT in fact received cash from\n\na vendor, a circumstance that PwC notes is specifically dealt with\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\fin EITF 02-16.   See generally Greebel, 194 F.3d at 205 (GAAP can\n\ntolerate a range of reasonable approaches).       Plaintiffs presume\n\nthat it should have been obvious to PwC that the connection fee and\n\ngrowth bonus were bogus entries that essentially netted out of the\n\ncontract price.10   However, there do not appear to be any facts\n\nsupporting this presumption.11    Simply pleading that the defendant\n\nknew of the falsity, without providing any factual basis for that\n\nknowledge, does not suffice.     Stone & Webster, 414 F.3d at 205-06.\n\n          Further, that ADT's accounting was ultimately restated in\n\nMarch 2003 does not raise a significant inference of scienter.\n\n\"[T]hat a speaker changes his or her mind and decides after the\n\nfact that an earlier opinion was ill-advised is insufficient to\n\nsupport an averment of subjective falsity.\"       Credit Suisse, 431\n\nF.3d at 49.      Moreover, as noted above, Tyco was in ongoing\n\ndiscussions with the SEC regarding its accounting practices, so\n\nneither the change nor its timing adds to the scienter equation.\n\n\n\n10\n   Even if one deemed PwC's failure to discover the problem\nnegligent, or perhaps inexcusably negligent, that is well short of\nthe conscious misconduct or extreme recklessness necessary to\nallege scienter. See Geffon v. Micrion Corp., 249 F.3d 29, 35-36\n(1st Cir. 2001).    Alleging a poor audit is not equivalent to\nalleging an intent to deceive. See Ferris Baker Watts, Inc. v.\nErnst & Young, LLP, 395 F.3d 851, 856 (8th Cir. 2005).\n11\n  In their opening brief, plaintiffs state that prior \"management\nwas corrupt, systematically bilking Tyco, and concealing its fraud\nfrom public scrutiny.\" (Emphasis added). The disclosure statements\nalso note prior management's propensity towards making false\nbooking entries and failing to record material events that should\nhave been recorded.\n\n                                 -26-\n\fSimilarly, the conclusorily presented \"laundry list\" of alleged\n\nGAAS violations, which lack any specific ties to the alleged fraud\n\nat issue, do not get plaintiffs far in creating a strong inference\n\nof scienter.    See Stone & Webster, 414 F.3d at 214.\n\n            Lastly, we come to allegations of PwC's financial motive.\n\n\"[A]bsent     truly   extraordinary     circumstances,   an   auditor's\n\nmotivation to continue a profitable business relationship is not\n\nsufficient by itself to support a strong inference of scienter.\"\n\nId. at 215.    Because the balance of plaintiffs' allegations have\n\nwashed out, the less than extraordinary financial ties between PwC\n\nand Tyco do not suffice.12\n\n                                 III.\n\n            For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court.\n\n\n\n\n12\n As to the remaining claims, a Rule 10b-5 violation by the\ncontrolled entity is an essential element of a § 20(a) controlling\nperson claim. See In Re Stone & Webster, Inc. Sec. Litig., 424 F.3d\n24, 27 (1st Cir. 2005). Our rejection of the § 10(b) claims\ntherefore dooms the plaintiffs' claims against the defendants under\n§ 20(a). See Credit Suisse, 431 F.3d at 53.\n\n                                 -27-\n\f",

Plaintiffs recount at some length the reported\n\nabuses    of    Tyco's    past    officers     and     directors,   notably   chief\n\nexecutive officer Dennis Kozlowski, chief financial officer Mark\n\nSwartz, chief corporate counsel Mark Belnick, and director Frank\n\nWalsh.    In 2002, as revelations of misconduct surfaced, there was\n\na major shake up at Tyco.            Tyco commissioned a massive internal\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\finvestigation led by the law firm of Boies Schiller & Flexner,\n\nwhich was aided by various accounting firms. All told, over 15,000\n\nattorney hours and 50,000 accountant hours were invested.1            As a\n\nconsequence, Tyco disclosed the alleged misconduct of its prior\n\nmanagement and made necessary accounting adjustments.          The changes\n\nwere costly, as Tyco's Form 10-K report for fiscal 2002 showed a\n\nnet loss of over nine billion dollars, a stark contrast from its\n\nnearly four billion dollars of profit in fiscal year 2001, and over\n\nfour and a half billion dollars profit in fiscal year 2000.             As\n\npart of Tyco's clean-up, new senior officers and directors were\n\nappointed.     Breen was made the chief executive officer in July\n\n2002, and Fitzpatrick was made the chief financial officer in\n\nSeptember 2002.\n\n             Plaintiffs' action focuses on the initial results of the\n\nclean-up, spanning the period between December 30, 2002 and March\n\n12, 2003.2     Plaintiffs allege that the clean-up fell well short of\n\nsanitizing Tyco's books, and that new management perpetuated a\n\nfraud   in    the   accounting   for     ADT,   one   of   Tyco's   largest\n\nsubsidiaries.\n\n\n\n1\n  The scope of the investigation was broad, and included the\nintegrity of the company's financial statements, the possible\nexistence of systemic fraud, and corporate governance issues. The\ninvestigation yielded numerous recommendations regarding Tyco's\naccounting and corporate governance practices.\n2\n  The misconduct during the prior period is the subject of other,\nongoing class-action law suits.\n\n                                   -3-\n\f             Plaintiffs     allege   that     ADT,    a   provider   of    security\n\nsystems, purchased customer contracts from its authorized dealers\n\nand accounted for the transactions in the following improper\n\nmanner.      First, ADT would ostensibly agree to purchase a customer\n\ncontract from a dealer for $1000.                    Second, the dealer would\n\nostensibly     agree   to   pay   ADT   $200   as     reimbursement       for   ADT's\n\nexpenses in connection with acquiring the contract (the \"connection\n\nfee\").    Third, ADT would remit the $800 net amount to the dealer\n\n(the only cash that changed hands), record the acquisition of the\n\ncontract at the full price of $1000, and record a $200 expense\n\noffset (income).       Significantly, ADT's actual expenses related to\n\neach contract were de minimis - $5 for a credit check - and ADT\n\nrecorded the difference ($195) as income. Plaintiffs allege that\n\nthis   was    \"Alice   in   Wonderland\"       accounting     because      Generally\n\nAccepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") require that intangible\n\nassets such as these contracts be recorded at their actual cost\n\n(here $805), and because no income is to be recognized under such\n\ncircumstances.     Thus, according to plaintiffs, these transactions\n\npermitted Tyco/ADT to fraudulently overstate ADT's income and\n\nassets.\n\n             Plaintiffs allege that the defendants made actionable\n\nmisrepresentations in connection with these transactions.                       First,\n\nin its 12/30/02 Form 8-K filed with the SEC, Tyco's management\n\ndisclosed the results of the internal investigation and stated that\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fTyco was \"not aware of any systemic or significant fraud related to\n\nthe Company's financial statements or of any clear accounting\n\nerrors    that     would    materially     adversely   affect   the    Company's\n\nreported earnings or cash flow from operations for the year 2003\n\nand thereafter.\"           The Form 8-K also purported to correct ADT's\n\naccounting, noting that to the extent the connection fee exceeded\n\nactual    costs,    it     \"should   be   deferred   and   amortized   over    the\n\nestimated useful life of an acquired customer relationship\" (ten\n\nyears). As a consequence, the Form 8-K reported that 2002 earnings\n\nwould be reduced by $135 million, and that a $185.9 million charge\n\nto earnings would be taken to adjust income improperly recognized\n\nin fiscal years 1999 to 2001 (a $320.9 million adjustment in all).\n\nTyco's Form 10-K, filed on 12/30/02, largely echoed the Form 8-K's\n\nrepresentations.         Notably, it stated that \"new senior management\n\nhas no reason to believe that the financial statements included in\n\nthis report are not fairly stated in all material respects.\"               As to\n\nADT's contract acquisitions, the Form 10-K noted that fees received\n\nfrom   dealers,     in     excess    of   actual   costs   incurred,   would    be\n\namortized over ten years as a \"deferred credit.\"                 The 10-K also\n\nincluded PwC's audit opinion, dated December 23, 2002, which\n\nstated:\n\n                    In   our   opinion,   the   accompanying\n            consolidated    balance   sheets   and   related\n            consolidated statements of operations, of\n            shareholders' equity and of cash flows present\n            fairly,    in   all   material   respects,   the\n            financial position of Tyco International, Ltd.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f            and its subsidiaries at September 30, 2002 and\n            2001, and the results of their operations and\n            their cash flows for each of the three years\n            in the period ended September 30, 2002, in\n            conformity    with    accounting    principles\n            generally accepted in the United States of\n            America . . . . We conducted our audits of\n            these statements in accordance with auditing\n            standards generally accepted in the United\n            States of America . . . .\n\n\n            Plaintiffs assert that these releases contained four\n\nfraudulent misstatements by the Tyco defendants: (1) that Tyco's\n\naccounting had been corrected; (2) that the financial statements\n\nfairly presented Tyco's status; (3) that all material accounting\n\nissues, particularly those involving ADT, had been corrected; and\n\n(4) that ADT would receive a $320.9 million revenue stream over the\n\nnext ten years.     Plaintiffs maintain that these representations\n\nwere false because there were still major problems in ADT's books,\n\nnotably that the income recognized from dealer \"connection fees\" to\n\nADT was \"imaginary,\" and that the contracts acquired were being\n\nrecorded at an artificially inflated cost.      Plaintiffs assert that\n\nthe defendants corrected only a technical, inconsequential error --\n\nthat the \"imaginary\" income was being recognized too quickly\n\n(immediately rather than over the life of the contract) -- in their\n\ninitial   restatement,   but   knowingly   permitted   more   significant\n\nerrors --   the improper recognition of income and the inflation of\n\nasset value -- to remain unaltered.        Plaintiffs also allege that\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fPwC, knowing of the errors in ADT's books, nonetheless wrongfully\n\nissued a \"clean\" audit opinion.\n\n            Plaintiffs allege that the fraud was brought to light in\n\nMarch 2003, when Tyco essentially admitted the fraud in a press\n\nrelease and subsequent Form 10-Q.             In a March 12, 2003 press\n\nrelease, Tyco stated that, pursuant to ongoing discussions with the\n\nSEC, it expected \"to take non-cash, pre-tax charges between $265\n\nmillion and $325 million for issues identified primarily in [ADT].\"\n\nTyco also announced that the president of ADT, Jerry Boggess, and\n\nother senior ADT managers, had been fired.                Tyco stock dropped\n\nsignificantly     on   the    news.      Plaintiffs     say   that    defendants\n\nacknowledged in their 3/31/03 Form 10-Q that they had been in\n\nongoing discussions with the SEC about their accounting for the\n\ndealer   fees   and    were   changing   their     accounting   for    the   non-\n\nrefundable dealer charges to treat them properly as a reduction in\n\nADT's costs in acquiring the contracts.3\n\n            Plaintiffs also allege that Tyco falsely attributed the\n\nMarch    2003   accounting    corrections     to    a   then-recently     issued\n\naccounting requirement from the Financial Accounting Standards\n\nBoard's Emerging Issues Task Force (\"EITF\") -- EITF 02-16 -- which\n\nhad nothing to do with the relevant accounting issue.                 Plaintiffs\n\n\n\n3\n  Plaintiffs also note that the Form 10-Q announced over $900\nmillion in additional charges to earnings to correct various\naccounting problems unearthed by \"intensified . . . internal audits\nand detailed controls and operating reviews . . . .\"\n\n                                      -7-\n\fassert that the proper accounting principle is and was located in\n\nAccounting Research Bulletin (\"ARB\") 43, which has been in effect\n\nsince 1953.\n\n          Plaintiffs also emphasize the actions of PwC's audit\n\nengagement partner for Tyco, Richard Scalzo.      The SEC, in an\n\nAccounting and Auditing Enforcement Action dated August 13, 2003,\n\nbarred Scalzo from practicing accounting before it based on its\n\nfinding that Scalzo had violated Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5 and\n\ncommitted improper professional conduct in connection with his\n\naudits of Tyco for fiscal years 1997-2001.   See </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">21938985</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">\n\n(SEC Release No. 1839). Essentially, the SEC concluded that Scalzo\n\nwas on notice of prior management's misconduct, failed to take the\n\nnecessary steps required by Generally Accepted Auditing Standards\n\n(\"GAAS\"), and recklessly permitted PwC to issue audit reports\n\nstating that Tyco's books had been audited according to GAAS.\n\n          Plaintiffs assert that the Tyco defendants had two basic\n\nmotivations for the alleged fraud. First, they wished to keep Tyco\n\nviable as a going concern.   Plaintiffs allege that Tyco had over\n\nfour billion dollars in debt coming due in early 2003, and faced\n\nimminent bankruptcy if it failed to meet these obligations.   Their\n\ntheory is that management misstated ADT's accounting to give the\n\nfalse impression that Tyco had a $320.9 million revenue stream,\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\fwhich permitted Tyco to obtain crucial financing.4        Second, they\n\nwanted to preserve their own lucrative positions, which included\n\nlarge salaries, bonuses, and stock options. Plaintiffs allege that\n\nthe Tyco defendants highlighted their deceit by providing false\n\nexplanations for the belated correction.\n\n            As to PwC, plaintiffs allege that PwC's audit opinion was\n\nfraudulent because PwC knowingly failed to comply with GAAS and was\n\naware that Tyco's accounting was not in compliance with GAAP.\n\nPlaintiffs state that PwC's motive was straightforward. PwC looked\n\nthe other way on Tyco's new fraud, just as it allegedly had with\n\npast frauds, to preserve its lucrative business relationship with\n\nTyco.\n\n            The district court dismissed the complaint, concluding\n\nthat    scienter   was   inadequately    alleged.   As   to   Breen   and\n\nFitzpatrick, the court concluded that their financial stake in\n\nTyco's continued viability was inadequate, standing alone, to\n\ncreate a strong inference of scienter, and that the balance of the\n\nallegations amounted to nothing more than \"fraud by hindsight,\" as\n\nthere was no basis for concluding that Breen and Fitzgerald knew\n\nthe disputed representations were false when made.       The court also\n\nheld that, because Tyco's liability was solely derivative of\n\n\n\n4\n Plaintiffs note that the Tyco defendants did not fully correct\nADT's accounting until after Tyco had successfully placed an over\nfour billion dollar bond offering and obtained a one and a half\nbillion dollar line of credit.\n\n                                   -9-\n\fBreen's and Fitzpatrick's, the claims against the corporate entity\n\nshould be dismissed.       Finally, the court concluded that PwC's\n\nfinancial stake in its continued business relationship with Tyco\n\nwas inadequate to create a strong inference of scienter, and that\n\nthe remaining allegations were either too vague or pertained only\n\nto conduct outside the class period.\n\n                                    II.\n\n            Plaintiffs   argue   that     the   district    court    erred   in\n\nevaluating in isolation their allegations of scienter on the part\n\nof   the   Tyco   defendants   rather   than    assessing   the     collective\n\npicture.    They further contend that the court erred in failing to\n\nappreciate the import of the alleged GAAP and GAAS violations that\n\nPwC countenanced, as well as the relevance of PwC's past misconduct\n\nin auditing Tyco.\n\n            We review the allowance of the defendants' motions to\n\ndismiss de novo.

Tyco defendants\n\n            As to the Tyco defendants, the plaintiffs argue that\n\nseveral factors which, taken together, establish scienter: (1) the\n\nsignificant GAAP violation in ADT's accounting; (2) defendants'\n\nfalse exculpatory statement that the March restatement was mandated\n\nby   EITF   02-16;   (3)   the    close    proximity   between     the   March\n\nrestatement   and    the   purported      December   2002   correction;     (4)\n\ndefendants' knowledge of Kozlowski's relationship with Boggess and\n\nADT; and (5) defendants' desire to save Tyco and maintain their\n\nlucrative positions. We conclude that the district court correctly\n\ndismissed the claims.\n\n            We begin with context.         The plaintiffs assert that the\n\ndistrict court failed to view their allegations in their entirety.\n\nBut we think it is the plaintiffs who are being myopic.            Plaintiffs\n\npay too little heed to the circumstances in which the alleged fraud\n\nwas taking place:     Tyco had new management, was in the midst of a\n\nmassive clean-up of fraud, and had disclosed the wrongdoing of\n\nprior management.      We think that it is important to bear this\n\ncontext in mind as we evaluate plaintiffs' claims.\n\n            Tyco's   statements    were     not   nearly    so   absolute    as\n\nplaintiffs present them. For example, the statement in the Form 8-\n\nK that management was currently unaware of systemic fraud was made\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fin the context the Form 8-K's recounting of the investigation,\n\nprior   management's   transgressions,   and   the   impossibility   of\n\ncorrecting all errors:\n\n                   Few, if any, major companies have ever\n           been subjected to the corporate governance and\n           accounting scrutiny entailed in Phase 2 of the\n           Boies Firm's work.       However, despite the\n           extent of the Boies Firm's work, the Company\n           has not sought to go back and identify every\n           accounting decision and every corporate act\n           over a multi-year period that was wrong or\n           questionable,    or   whether   there    was   a\n           preferable accounting treatment among the\n           alternative treatments available under [GAAP].\n           Given the size and scope of the Company's\n           operations,    such   a   task,   or    anything\n           approaching it, would have been impossible\n           within any plausible time-frame. Moreover, in\n           part   because   of   the   passage   of   time,\n           documentation was not always available; the\n           documentation that was available was often\n           dispersed; and neither the Boies Firm nor the\n           Company had the benefit of information from\n           prior senior management of Tyco because the\n           former    Chief   Executive    Officer,    Chief\n           Financial Officer, and Chief Corporate Counsel\n           have all been under criminal indictment during\n           the course of this review and analysis. All\n           of these factors, as well as the Company's\n           past failure to document many decisions\n           contemporaneously, would have limited the\n           conclusions that could have been drawn\n           concerning individual accounting treatments in\n           any event.      Nonetheless, for the actual\n           purposes of the work, as discussed above, the\n           Company believes that the scope and detail of\n           the   review,   and   the   documentation    and\n           information available, was sufficient to reach\n           the conclusions discussed below.\n\n                  The Company is not aware of any\n           systemic or significant fraud related to the\n           Company's financial statements or of any clear\n           accounting   errors  that   would   materially\n           adversely   affect  the   Company's   reported\n\n                                -14-\n\f          earnings or cash flow from operations for the\n          year 2003 and thereafter.          However, as\n          discussed    below,   certain    instances    of\n          erroneous   accounting    entries    have   been\n          identified and corrected.         In addition,\n          current management has concluded that, in the\n          past, the Company in general suffered from\n          poor documentation; inadequate policies and\n          procedures to prevent the misconduct of senior\n          executives     that    occurred;      inadequate\n          procedures       for     proper       corporate\n          authorizations; inadequate approval procedures\n          and documentation; a lack of oversight by\n          senior management at the corporate level; a\n          pattern of using aggressive accounting that,\n          even when not erroneous, was undertaken with\n          the purpose and effect of increasing reported\n          results above what they would have been if\n          more   conservative   accounting    were   used;\n          pressure on, and inducements to, segment and\n          unit managers to increase current earnings,\n          including by decisions as to what accounting\n          treatment to employ; and a lack of stated and\n          demonstrable commitment by former         senior\n          corporate   management   to   set    appropriate\n          standards of ethics, integrity, accounting,\n          and corporate governance. . . .\n\n          Similarly,   the   Form   10-K's   representation   that   new\n\nmanagement believed the financial statements were fairly stated\n\nincluded the caveat:\n\n          There can be no assurances, however, that new\n          problems will not be found in the future. We\n          expect to continue to improve our controls\n          with each passing quarter. It will take some\n          time, however, before we have in place the\n          rigorous controls that our Board of Directors\n          and new senior management desire and our\n          shareholders deserve.\n\n          The Form 10-K sounded other cautionary notes as well.\n\nUnder \"risk factors,\" in addition to cautioning that continuing\n\nnegative publicity and pending litigation could have a substantial\n\n                                -15-\n\fnegative impact on Tyco, the Form 10-K warned that more bad news\n\ncould be on the horizon:\n\n                  We and others have received various\n          subpoenas and requests from the SEC, the\n          District Attorney of New York, and the U.S.\n          Attorney for the District of New Hampshire and\n          others seeking the production of voluminous\n          documents    in   connection     with   various\n          investigations      into    our     governance,\n          management, operations, accounting and related\n          controls.     We cannot predict when these\n          investigations will be completed, nor can we\n          predict    what    the    results    of   these\n          investigations may be. It is possible that we\n          will be required to pay material fines,\n          consent to injunctions on future conduct, lose\n          the   ability   to    conduct   business   with\n          government instrumentalities or suffer other\n          penalties, each of which could have a material\n          adverse effect on our business....\n\n          Perhaps     most    significantly,      the    Form    10-K    also\n\nspecifically cautioned about on-going review by the SEC:\n\n                 As of the filing date of this Form 10-\n          K, we continue to be engaged in a dialogue\n          with the SEC's Division of Corporation\n          Finance, as part of a routine review of our\n          periodic filings.   While we believe that we\n          have resolved the material accounting issues\n          prior to filings there can be no assurance\n          that the resolution of the remaining comments\n          issued by the Staff will not necessitate one\n          or more amendments to this or prior periodic\n          reports.\n\nEssentially, the warned-of hazard came to pass regarding ADT's\n\ncontract accounting.

Moreover,\n\nattempts to provide investors with warnings of risks generally\n\nweaken the inference of scienter. See Geffon v.

From this context, we proceed to\n\nplaintiffs' specific allegations.\n\n            As to GAAP violations, there is nothing in the complaint\n\nsupporting an inference that Breen or Fitzgerald were directly\n\ninvolved in these detailed accounting matters or had knowledge of\n\ntheir alleged falsity.           See Stone & Webster, 414 F.3d at 199\n\n(nothing supporting inference that senior officers were involved in\n\ndetails of accounting).           While Fitzgerald, as chief financial\n\nofficer, might be expected to have some general supervisory role\n\nover the accounting issues, he appeared on the scene only weeks\n\nbefore the Form 8-K was prepared, and there is no indication that\n\nhe   was   aware    of   any   impropriety.    See   id.    Moreover,   the\n\nrepresentations in Tyco's filings were, in essence, estimations of\n\nwhether the books still contained significant errors.         Plaintiffs'\n\nallegations fall short of establishing that these estimations were\n\nunreasonable in light of the massive internal investigation.            See\n\nid. at 201.        In sum, there are no alleged facts that strongly\n\nsuggest that the defendants knew any of the challenged statements\n\nwere false when made.          See Credit Suisse, 431 F.3d at 49-50; see\n\nalso Blackwell, 440 F.3d at 289 (no factual allegations supporting\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\finference that individual defendants knew true value of assets or\n\nthat discount rate or credit-loss assumption was improper).\n\n           Plaintiffs' reliance on the defendants' allegedly false\n\nattribution of the restatement to EITF 02-16 is similarly flawed.\n\nObviously, evidence of conscious wrongdoing may be shown by facts\n\ndemonstrating concealment.    See generally Cabletron, 311 F.3d at\n\n39.   But the allegations fall short again here.   There is simply no\n\nbasis for concluding that the individual defendants were involved\n\nin or had personal knowledge of this detailed accounting issue.\n\nSee Stone & Webster, 414 F.3d at 199.\n\n           Plaintiffs are correct that a short time period between\n\nan alleged misstatement and a later disclosure of inconsistent\n\ninformation may be relevant to the question of scienter.

In\n\nthis case, however, the timing of the correction has limited\n\nprobative value, as the change appears to have been prompted by\n\nSEC's Division of Corporation Finance.7      The simple fact of a\n\n\n7\n Plaintiffs have moved the court to take judicial notice of the\nSEC's 2006 complaint against Tyco in the United States District\nCourt for the Southern District of New York, the subsequent consent\ndecree, and the final judgment entered against Tyco (collectively\nthe \"Consent Decree\"). In the Consent Decree, Tyco agreed to pay a\n50 million dollar civil fine and not to contest, inter alia, that\nADT's contract accounting was wrongful. We grant the motion.\n      We note that the SEC describes ADT's accounting practices\nsomewhat differently than do the plaintiffs. According to the SEC,\nin 1997, Tyco began charging dealers a $200 connection fee when ADT\npurchased their contracts while simultaneously increasing the price\nADT paid to the dealers by $200 (from $800 to $1000). Tyco then\nclassified this premium \"paid\" to the dealers a \"growth bonus.\"\n\n                                -18-\n\fcorrection is also not particularly probative; \"[p]laintiffs may\n\nnot simply seize upon disclosures made later and allege that they\n\nshould have been made earlier.\"   Cabletron, 311 F.3d at 37.\n\n          That the defendants were generally aware of Kozlowski's\n\nrelationship with Boggess also does not suffice.   It is ordinarily\n\nnot sufficient to conclusorily allege \"an overarching fraudulent\n\nscheme or corrupt environment.\"    Credit Suisse, 431 F.3d at 49.\n\nSimilarly, that there had been issues with ADT is not enough.\n\n\"Fraud cannot be inferred simply because [a parent corporation]\n\nmight have been more curious or concerned about the activity at [a\n\nsubsidiary].\"   Chill v.

Moreover, plaintiffs fail to account for both Breen's and\n\nFitzgerald's general unfamiliarity with Tyco.8 Indeed, the fact of\n\n\nThe $200 connection fee was immediately recognized as income, but\nthe offsetting $200 growth bonus was amortized over 10 years.\nBecause the connection fee and growth bonus cancelled each other\nout, they did not alter the economic substance of the contract\nacquisition, should not have been recognized under GAAP, and\nsignificantly inflated Tyco's income and cash flow. The SEC noted\nthat Tyco terminated the connection fee and restated its operating\nincome and cash flow in 2003 as a result of a review by the SEC's\nDivision of Corporation Finance.\n     Plaintiffs assert that the SEC action validates their claims,\nas the SEC found the same conduct that plaintiffs challenge to be\nwrongful under the securities laws. However, the Consent Decree,\nin addition to being three years after the fact, is of very limited\nrelevance. That the SEC concluded that an ADT accounting practice,\nadopted in 1997 by past Tyco officers, was wrongful, adds little to\ncreating a strong inference of scienter on the part of current Tyco\nofficers.\n8\n Interestingly, Tyco noted the presence of new management\nunfamiliar with Tyco in the midst of a clean up as a \"Risk Factor\"\nin its Form 10-K:\n\n                               -19-\n\fBreen's and Fitzpatrick's recent arrivals, and consequent lack of\n\ninvolvement   in   past   dubious     decisions,   undermines   most   of\n\nplaintiffs' allegations.\n\n           This brings us to plaintiffs' allegations of motive and\n\nopportunity. \"'[C]atch-all allegations' which merely assert motive\n\nand opportunity, without something more, fail to satisfy the\n\nPSLRA.\"   Cabletron, 311 F.3d at 39.       The question becomes whether\n\nplaintiffs have alleged \"more than the usual concern by executives\n\nto improve financial results.\"       Id.\n\n            The key motivation alleged is Breen's and Fitzgerald's\n\ndesperation to save Tyco from bankruptcy.

It will\n     take some time for our new management team and our new\n     board of directors to learn our various businesses and to\n     develop strong working relationships with our cadre of\n     operating managers at our various subsidiary companies.\n     Our new senior management team's ability to complete this\n     process is hindered by their need to spend significant\n     time and effort dealing with internal and external\n     investigations, developing effective corporate governance\n     procedures, strengthening reporting lines and reviewing\n     internal controls. During this period and in order to\n     complete the process, our new executives will be in part\n     dependent   on   advisors,   including   certain   former\n     directors.     We cannot assure you that this major\n     restructuring of our board of directors and senior\n     management team will not adversely affect our results of\n     operations, at least in the near term, especially in\n     light of the significant attention they are required to\n     devote to such other matters.\n\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\ffactual allegations to support the inference that Tyco faced\n\nimminent bankruptcy: (1) that Tyco had to repay or refinance nearly\n\nfour billion dollars in debt in February 2003; (2) that Breen\n\nacknowledged that Tyco faced a liquidity gap in 2003 if it failed\n\nto obtain a one and a half billion dollar line of credit; and (3)\n\nthat some suppliers had requested letters of credit from Tyco.\n\nThese allegations are rather limited and conclusory, particularly\n\nwhen set against Tyco's enormous assets (well over sixty billion\n\ndollars worth, per the Form 10-K), significant shareholder equity\n\n(over twenty-five billion dollars), and          substantial going-concern\n\nvalue   (despite    significant    continued     write-downs,      Tyco   earned\n\napproximately a billion dollars in 2003 and its earnings have\n\nclimbed steadily since then).          This collection of facts does not\n\nsupport a strong inference of imminent bankruptcy.              Cf. Baron v.\n\nSmith, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201208\"><a href=\"/opinion/201208/baron-v-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">380</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57 (1st Cir. 2004)(an event of default is\n\ndifferent from an actual default).\n\n              Further, this case is different from those relied upon by\n\nthe plaintiffs.      Here, the defendants were not acting to conceal\n\ntheir   own    errors   or   justify    their   past   strategic    decisions.\n\nCompare Cabletron, 311 F.3d at 38-39; Aldridge, 284 F.3d at 83-84.\n\nIn addition, the defendants' compensation appears to be largely\n\n\"up-front\" or otherwise guaranteed, perhaps as an acknowledgment of\n\nrisk.    As to their stock options, it is not at all clear why\n\ndefendants would prefer postponing profit reducing and stock price\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\freducing write-downs to future years (when their options would have\n\nvested) to swallowing the entire bitter pill in 2002.\n\n            The dueling inferences, taken as wholes, break down as\n\nfollows.    Did the defendants, brought in to clean up a massive and\n\nwell-publicized       fraud   and    actively   scrutinized   by    the   SEC,\n\nfinancial    media,    and    bar,   fraudulently   commit    an   accounting\n\nviolation (and fully document their fraud in Tyco's SEC filings) to\n\nbriefly delay recognition of an additional write-down in the ADT\n\nbooks and present the illusion of a limited9 additional revenue\n\nstream to obtain needed financing, only to reveal their wrongdoing\n\nto all concerned (including their new creditors) in a subsequent\n\nfiling to the SEC shortly thereafter?           Or did the new management,\n\nhaving been advised by an internal investigation of errors in ADT's\n\naccounting that required a 320 million dollar adjustment, believe\n\ntheir job was done as to that subsidiary (one of approximately\n\n2300), only to subsequently discover (with the SEC's assistance)\n\nthat ADT's books had more mischief to address than first realized?\n\nUnder all the facts and circumstances alleged, the second inference\n\nis at least as strong as the first and thus dooms plaintiffs'\n\nclaims.    See Credit Suisse, 431 F.3d at 49.\n\n\n\n\n9\n  A 320 million dollar income stream to be recognized over ten\nyears (or 32 million dollars a year) would appear to be of limited\nconsequence in obtaining over four billion dollars in loans and\nover an additional billion and a half dollars in credit, while\nsimultaneously recognizing a nine billion dollar loss.\n\n                                      -22-\n\fB. PwC\n\n             Plaintiffs   emphasize    the       following     allegations      as\n\ndemonstrating PwC's scienter: (1) that the initial restatement of\n\nthe ADT books in 2002 was an \"obvious\" GAAP violation that resulted\n\nin a significant second restatement less than three months later;\n\n(2) that PwC committed a host of GAAS violations in connection with\n\nits 2002 audit; (3) that Scalzo was intimately involved in the\n\ncreation of the 2002 financial statements; (4) that PwC was well\n\naware of prior bad acts by Tyco's former management and ignored the\n\nnumerous \"red flags\" implicated by those acts; and (5) that PwC had\n\nan    enormous   financial   incentive      to   keep   Tyco    as    a    client.\n\nPlaintiffs stress that PwC specifically reaffirmed the validity of\n\nthe 2001 financial statements in its 2002 audit opinion, rendering\n\nthe prior misconduct relevant to the instant action.                      We again\n\nconclude that the district court reached the correct result.\n\n             We first note, as did the district court, that plaintiffs\n\nattempt to muddy the waters with their emphasis on 2001.                  The only\n\nrepresentations made by PwC challenged by plaintiffs in this action\n\nare contained within PwC's 2002 audit opinion letter.                 While the\n\n2002 audit opinion makes a passing reference to 2001, the fact\n\nremains that plaintiffs' action targets representations, made at\n\nthe close of 2002, regarding ADT's contract acquisition accounting.\n\nPlaintiffs have shown no connection between their current action\n\nand    any   representations   in     the    2001    financial       statements.\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fMoreover, the prior misconduct relating to prior years' financial\n\nstatements had been disclosed in Tyco's 2002 filings.                     As before,\n\nplaintiffs have overlooked the most important circumstances of the\n\ncase:     that     new    management   had    been    appointed     and    Tyco   was\n\nattempting to clean up its operations.\n\n               For that reason, plaintiffs' reliance on Scalzo's conduct\n\nis unavailing.           Indeed, the SEC's ruling banning Scalzo from\n\npracticing      accountancy    before    it    specifically       refers     to   his\n\nwrongful conduct in the 1997 through 2001 fiscal years.                        While\n\nplaintiffs assert that Scalzo was still assigned to Tyco in 2002,\n\nthe climate had changed.          Given the internal investigation, new\n\nmanagement, massive restatements, and public scrutiny, it is not a\n\nlikely inference, based upon the factual allegations, that Scalzo\n\n(to whatever extent that he remained involved) was still engaged in\n\nthe same wrongful conduct.         And in any event, plaintiffs fail to\n\nprovide any specific allegations regarding Scalzo's involvement in\n\nthe     2002     financial    statements.            Furthermore,     plaintiffs'\n\nallegations that PwC disregarded various \"red flags,\" based upon\n\nits detailed knowledge of past misdeeds, is unavailing. Correcting\n\nthe past misstatements was the focus of the new management and the\n\ninternal investigation.         Significantly, the SEC's ruling banning\n\nScalzo does not mention the dealer accounting issue at ADT (or\n\nanything like it), making it questionable whether PwC would have\n\nbeen aware of difficulties there.            The presence of \"red flags\" not\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\facted upon by an auditor is not sufficient to raise a strong\n\ninference of scienter if there are no facts showing that the\n\nauditor knew (or willfully blinded itself to the knowledge) that\n\nthe underlying facts, if properly accounted for, would result in\n\nsignificant changes to audited financial statements.                    See Fidel v.\n\nFarley, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 229 (6th Cir. 2005).\n\n            Having     cleared     the    underbrush,    we     now     examine    the\n\nplaintiffs' remaining allegations against PwC.                 We start with the\n\nalleged GAAP violation. \"Merely stating in conclusory fashion that\n\na company's books are out of compliance with GAAP would not itself\n\ndemonstrate      liability     under     section      10(b)    or     Rule   10b-5.\"\n\nCabletron, 311 F.3d at 34.          Moreover, the circumstances are more\n\ncomplex than plaintiffs indicate -- that intangible assets like the\n\ncontracts are recorded at actual cost pursuant to ARB 43.                          One\n\ncomplication, as plaintiffs concede, is that \"ARB 43\" has no\n\nrelevance   to    this    issue,    as    it    was   superceded      long   ago   by\n\nAccounting Principles Board Opinion 17 and Financial Accounting\n\nStandards Board Opinion 147 (although plaintiffs maintain that the\n\nunderlying principle has remained the same).                  Another is that the\n\nADT contract acquisitions also included a connection fee (and a\n\ngrowth   bonus    in     the   SEC's     description).          These    additional\n\ntransactions make the accounting issue more complex, as ADT's\n\nrecords create the impression that ADT in fact received cash from\n\na vendor, a circumstance that PwC notes is specifically dealt with\n\n\n                                         -25-\n\fin EITF 02-16.   See generally Greebel, 194 F.3d at 205 (GAAP can\n\ntolerate a range of reasonable approaches).       Plaintiffs presume\n\nthat it should have been obvious to PwC that the connection fee and\n\ngrowth bonus were bogus entries that essentially netted out of the\n\ncontract price.10   However, there do not appear to be any facts\n\nsupporting this presumption.11    Simply pleading that the defendant\n\nknew of the falsity, without providing any factual basis for that\n\nknowledge, does not suffice.     Stone & Webster, 414 F.3d at 205-06.\n\n          Further, that ADT's accounting was ultimately restated in\n\nMarch 2003 does not raise a significant inference of scienter.\n\n\"[T]hat a speaker changes his or her mind and decides after the\n\nfact that an earlier opinion was ill-advised is insufficient to\n\nsupport an averment of subjective falsity.\"       Credit Suisse, 431\n\nF.3d at 49.      Moreover, as noted above, Tyco was in ongoing\n\ndiscussions with the SEC regarding its accounting practices, so\n\nneither the change nor its timing adds to the scienter equation.\n\n\n\n10\n   Even if one deemed PwC's failure to discover the problem\nnegligent, or perhaps inexcusably negligent, that is well short of\nthe conscious misconduct or extreme recklessness necessary to\nallege scienter.

Micrion Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199400\"><a href=\"/opinion/199400/geffon-v-micrion-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 35-36\n(1st Cir. 2001).    Alleging a poor audit is not equivalent to\nalleging an intent to deceive.

The disclosure statements\nalso note prior management's propensity towards making false\nbooking entries and failing to record material events that should\nhave been recorded.\n\n                                 -26-\n\fSimilarly, the conclusorily presented \"laundry list\" of alleged\n\nGAAS violations, which lack any specific ties to the alleged fraud\n\nat issue, do not get plaintiffs far in creating a strong inference\n\nof scienter.    See Stone & Webster, 414 F.3d at 214.\n\n            Lastly, we come to allegations of PwC's financial motive.\n\n\"[A]bsent     truly   extraordinary     circumstances,   an   auditor's\n\nmotivation to continue a profitable business relationship is not\n\nsufficient by itself to support a strong inference of scienter.\"\n\nId. at 215.    Because the balance of plaintiffs' allegations have\n\nwashed out, the less than extraordinary financial ties between PwC\n\nand Tyco do not suffice.12\n\n                                 III.\n\n            For the reasons stated above, we affirm the judgment of\n\nthe district court.\n\n\n\n\n12\n As to the remaining claims, a Rule 10b-5 violation by the\ncontrolled entity is an essential element of a § 20(a) controlling\nperson claim.
