Ronald R. Lagueux, U.S. Senior District Judge]\n\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Jane Elizabeth Lee, for appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Peter F. Neronha, Assistant United States Attorney and\nCraig N. Moore, Acting United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                         June 24, 2004\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.     A jury convicted defendant-\n\nappellant Anthony Sabetta of violating 18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g) and\n\n924(e), which prohibit a felon from possessing a firearm.        The\n\ndistrict court sentenced him to 262 months in prison and a five\n\nyear term of supervised release.      Sabetta appeals, claiming that\n\nthe district court erred by: (1) responding to a jury question\n\nwithout first showing or reading the jury note to counsel; (2)\n\nresponding to the jury's question by using an example involving the\n\nfacts of the case; (3) failing to define the term \"knowingly\"; and\n\n(4) admitting certain testimony.   After careful review, we affirm.\n\n                          I.   Background\n\n          In the early morning on September 1, 2000, Sabetta,\n\nDaniel Andino, and Sabetta's girlfriend were going out to eat.\n\nWhile leaving his Cranston, Rhode Island home, Sabetta encountered\n\nJames Corio and Christopher Colardo.     A fight ensued in the front\n\nyard.   Neighbors called the police and reported the disturbance.\n\nThe police arrived to investigate.       By the time they arrived,\n\nhowever, Sabetta was no longer at the scene.\n\n          In the afternoon of September 1, Andino was attacked by\n\ntwo men in connection with a separate dispute.        Andino called\n\nSabetta and told him about the altercation.      He asked Sabetta if\n\nSabetta would drive Andino's car and help Andino look for his\n\nattackers.   Sabetta agreed and drove Andino's car in search of\n\nAndino's attackers.\n\n\n                                -2-\n\f            Also in the afternoon of September 1, Colardo's mother\n\nand sister went to the police station to inform the police that\n\nSabetta had      possessed     a    gun    during   the   early   morning    fight.\n\nNeither Colardo's mother nor any of the other witnesses interviewed\n\nby the police earlier that day had mentioned a gun.                       Colardo's\n\nmother gave the police the make, model, and license number of\n\nAndino's car.\n\n            In the evening of September 1, while Sabetta and Andino\n\nwere searching for Andino's attackers, a Cranston police officer,\n\nresponding to Colardo's report, stopped Andino's car, which Sabetta\n\nwas driving.      The police searched the car and found a gun in a\n\nhidden compartment behind the glove compartment.                        Sabetta and\n\nAndino were arrested.\n\n            Sabetta was charged in federal district court with being\n\na felon in possession of a firearm.1             On April 6, 2001, Sabetta was\n\nconvicted and sentenced. Sabetta appealed his conviction, and this\n\ncourt reversed and remanded for a new trial after the government\n\nconceded   that    some   of       the    prosecutor's    closing      remarks   were\n\nimproper and prejudicial.\n\n            On January 7, 2003, Sabetta's second trial commenced.\n\nSabetta    was   again    convicted        and   sentenced.       He   appeals   the\n\nconviction.\n\n\n\n1\n   Sabetta stipulated that he was a convicted felon as defined by\n18 U.S.C. §§ 922(g) and 924(e).\n\n                                           -3-\n\f                           II.   Analysis\n\n          A.   The jury's note\n\n          On January 13, 2003, after five days of trial, the jury\n\nretired to deliberate.    After deliberating for three hours, the\n\ntrial judge was informed that the jury had two questions.               The\n\ntrial judge brought the jury back into the courtroom.           With all\n\nparties present, the trial judge learned, for the first time, that\n\nthe jury had reduced its questions to writing.        The judge read the\n\nnote and stated:   \"Your first question is, what is the definition\n\nof possession . . . [and] [t]he second question is, does being in\n\na vehicle that contains a concealed firearm constitute possession?\"\n\nWithout giving counsel an opportunity to discuss possible answers\n\nto the jury questions, the judge answered them.\n\n          Immediately    after   the    jury   left   the   courtroom    to\n\ndeliberate further, the judge asked the lawyers if \"anyone want[s]\n\nto put anything on the record?\"        Defense counsel stated he wanted\n\nto \"think for a second\" and then stated that he had no objection.\n\nForty minutes later, the jury found the defendant guilty.\n\n          In this circuit, the\n\n          preferred practice for handling a jury message\n          should include these steps: (1) the jury's\n          communique should be reduced to writing; (2)\n          the note should be marked as an exhibit for\n          identification; (3) it should be shown, or\n          read fully, to counsel; and (4) counsel should\n          be given an opportunity to suggest an\n          appropriate rejoinder. If the note requires a\n          response ore tenus, the jury should then be\n          recalled, the note read into the record or\n\n                                 -4-\n\f          summarized by the court, the supplemental\n          instructions given, and counsel afforded an\n          opportunity to object at side-bar.\n\nUnited States v. Maraj, 947 F.2d 520, 525 (1st Cir. 1991) (footnote\n\nomitted); see also Shields v. United States, 273 U.S. 583, 588\n\n(1927) (holding that \"[w]here a jury has retired to consider of its\n\nverdict, and supplementary instructions are required . . . they\n\nought to be given either in the presence of counsel or after notice\n\nand an opportunity to be present\").     In the case before us, the\n\njury note was not marked as an exhibit, and counsel was not given\n\nan opportunity to suggest an appropriate rejoinder before the trial\n\njudge answered the jury's questions.\n\n          Despite the supplemental instructions being given in a\n\nmanner contrary to circuit practice, a trial court's error will not\n\nrequire reversal if the error is harmless.    See United States v.\n\nParent, 954 F.2d 23, 25 (1st Cir. 1992) (stating that \"a trial\n\ncourt's error in failing seasonably to inform counsel about a jury\n\nnote does not require reversal if the error is benign\").       This\n\ncircuit has not yet taken a position on which harmless error\n\nstandard applies when a trial court fails to disclose or discuss a\n\nnote from a deliberating jury.    See Parent at 25, n.5; Maraj, 947\n\nF.2d at 526.   Either the stricter standard, asking whether the\n\nerror was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, see Chapman v.\n\nCalifornia, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967), or the more lenient standard,\n\nasking whether the error had substantial and injurious effect or\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\finfluence vis-a-vis the judgment, see Kotteakos v. United States,\n\n328 U.S. 750, 776 (1946), applies.           Yet again, we need not decide\n\nwhich standard applies as the error in this case was harmless under\n\neither standard.\n\n            The trial judge's failure to allow counsel to suggest an\n\nappropriate    rejoinder    was   harmless    beyond       a    reasonable    doubt\n\nbecause counsel was present when the jury's questions were read and\n\nanswered.     Cf. Rogers v. United States, 422 U.S. 35, 39 (1975)\n\n(harmful    error   for   court   to   respond   to    a       jury   note   without\n\ninforming counsel of the note); Parent, 954 F.2d at 27 (same);\n\nUnited States v. Neff, 10 F.3d 1321, 1322 (7th Cir. 1993) (same).\n\nDefense counsel thus had the opportunity to object or to request a\n\nside-bar had he believed the judge's answers to be incorrect or\n\nunfairly prejudicial.       See Maraj, 947 F.2d at 525 (stating that\n\n\"[i]f the note requires a response ore tenus . . . the supplemental\n\ninstructions [should be] given, and counsel afforded an opportunity\n\nto object at side-bar\").          Unlike cases where the defendant was\n\n\"kept in the dark\" regarding the existence or content of the jury's\n\nnote, in this case Sabetta's counsel had the ability to object\n\nbefore the jury's note was read, after the jury's note was read,\n\nduring the court's rejoinder, or after the court's rejoinder.\n\nCompare Parent, 954 F.2d at 24 (counsel was \"kept in the dark\"\n\nregarding jury's note and judge's reply).             Being present when the\n\njury's note was first read and answered also afforded Sabetta's\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fcounsel the opportunity to \"prime the pump of persuasion,\" had he\n\nbeen inclined to do so.         See Parent, 954 F.2d at 24 (stating that\n\nnot having the opportunity to \"prime the pump of persuasion\" can be\n\nan injury).\n\n              Although it may be possible for a harmful error to occur\n\neven when counsel has an opportunity to object, in this case it is\n\nclear that there was no such error.                  Once the jury retired, the\n\ntrial judge asked if \"anyone want[s] to put anything on the\n\nrecord.\"      After taking a moment to think about it, defense counsel\n\nstated he had no objection to the instruction.\n\n              As a result, we hold that the district court committed an\n\nerror    by    not    giving   Sabetta    an     opportunity     to   suggest   an\n\nappropriate rejoinder before the trial judge answered the jury's\n\nquestions, but such an error was harmless beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt.     See Maraj, 947 F.2d at 526 (holding that an error was\n\nharmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the \"judge's comments\n\nwere     neither      unduly   coercive        nor    arguably   unsatisfactory.\n\nMoreover, had the full note been contemporaneously disclosed, there\n\nwas nothing more that defense counsel could appropriately have\n\ndone.\").\n\n              B.     The judge's rejoinder\n\n              Sabetta contends that the trial judge's answer to the\n\nsecond question in the jury note invaded the province of the jury\n\nas the finder of fact and thus violated his Sixth Amendment right\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fto a trial by jury.      The second question posed by the jury was\n\n\"[D]oes being in a vehicle that contains a concealed firearm\n\nconstitute possession?\"    The judge responded:\n\n          Now I discussed constructive possession with\n          you, and I think that comes up as a result of\n          your second question here . . . . [T]here's\n          several    requirements    for    constructive\n          possession. If, for example, someone is in a\n          vehicle and knows, knows that a gun is in the\n          glove compartment, and has the intention to\n          exercise dominion and control over that item,\n          that's constructive possession.       So that\n          illustrates     the     difference     between\n          constructive possession and actual possession.\n\n          Because   Sabetta's   counsel    did    not   object   to   this\n\ninstruction at trial, we review for plain error. See United States\n\nv. Paniagua-Ramos, 251 F.3d 242, 246 (1st Cir. 2001).        \"The plain\n\nerror hurdle, high in all events, nowhere looms larger than in the\n\ncontext of alleged instructional errors.\"        Id. (citation omitted).\n\nUnder the plain error standard, Sabetta must establish \"(1) that an\n\nerror occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only\n\n(3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4)\n\nseriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings.\"    United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60\n\n(1st Cir. 2001) (citations omitted).      Review of an erroneous jury\n\ninstruction is evaluated in light of the entire charge.          Jones v.\n\nUnited States, 527 U.S. 373, 390-91 (1999).\n\n          The Sixth Amendment grants a defendant in a criminal case\n\nthe right to a trial by jury.    A district court must use extreme\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fcaution in answering questions from juries so as not to usurp the\n\njury's fact finding role.      As we have noted on many occasions,\n\n\"undeniably inherent in the constitutional guarantee of trial by\n\njury is the principle that a court may not step in and direct a\n\nfinding of contested fact in favor of the prosecution regardless of\n\nhow overwhelmingly the evidence may point in that direction.\"\n\nUnited States v. Rivera-Santiago, 107 F.3d 960, 965 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(citations and quotations omitted); United States v. Argentine, 814\n\nF.2d 783, 788 (1st Cir. 1987).\n\n           In this case, the trial judge's response to the jury's\n\nquestion was not ideal.     Instead of re-reading the definition of\n\nconstructive possession for the jury, the judge used an example,\n\ninvolving the scenario in the case, to illustrate the definition of\n\nconstructive possession.     Despite the trial judge's poor selection\n\nof an example based on the facts of the case, the judge's answer to\n\nthe jury's question did not usurp the jury's fact finding role.\n\n           During the trial, the prosecution attempted to prove that\n\nSabetta knew the gun was in the glove compartment and that he\n\nintended to exercise control over the gun.       The defense attempted\n\nto prove that Sabetta was merely in a car that contained a\n\nconcealed weapon.     The jury, unclear about the requirements of\n\nconstructive possession, inquired if \"being in a vehicle that\n\ncontains   a   concealed   firearm    constitute[s]   possession.\"   In\n\nresponse, the trial judge properly informed the jury that \"there's\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fseveral requirements for constructive possession.\"       The judge then\n\nexplained that constructive possession exists \"[i]f, for example,\n\nsomeone is in a vehicle and knows, knows that a gun is in the glove\n\ncompartment, and has the intention to exercise dominion and control\n\nover that item.\"    The jury, as the finder of fact, was required to\n\ndetermine whether the defendant knew that a gun was in the glove\n\ncompartment and whether the defendant had the intention to exercise\n\ndominion and control over the gun.        The judge's rejoinder did not\n\nanswer either of these questions for the jury.          Compare Rivera-\n\nSantiago, 107 F.3d at 965-66 (holding that an error occurred\n\nbecause the judge's answer encouraged the jury to believe certain\n\ntestimony);    United States v. Argentine, 814 F.2d 783, 787 (1st\n\nCir. 1987) (holding that an error occurred because the \"judge's\n\nhandling of the jury question relieved the prosecution of [its]\n\nburden in an unfair way\").    Although it would have been preferable\n\nfor the judge to limit his rejoinder to re-reading the definition\n\nof   constructive    possession,   the    judge's   rejoinder   did   not\n\nconstitute plain error because the judge did not usurp the jury's\n\nfact finding role.\n\n          C.   Defining the term \"knowingly\"\n\n          The trial court instructed the jury that the crime of\n\nfelon in possession of a firearm requires that the defendant\n\n\"knowingly possessed the firearm in question.\"          The court then\n\nexplained that actual possession occurs when \"a person . . .\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fknowingly has direct physical control over a thing at a given\n\ntime.\"    The court explained that constructive possession occurs\n\nwhen \"[a] person who, although not in actual possession, knowingly\n\nhas both the power and intention at a given time to exercise\n\ndominion or control over a thing, either directly or through\n\nanother person, or persons.\"\n\n              Sabetta's counsel originally objected to this charge\n\nbecause he \"didn't hear knowledge of the presence of the firearm\"\n\nin the court's definition of possession.                  In response to this\n\nobjection, the trial judge informed counsel that the instructions\n\ncontained the phrase \"knowingly has the power and intention at a\n\ngiven time to exercise dominion or control.\"                   Upon hearing this,\n\ndefense counsel dropped the issue and replied \"[t]hank you.\"\n\n              On appeal, Sabetta argues that the trial court erred\n\nbecause it failed to define the term \"knowingly.\"                     During the\n\ntrial,    Sabetta    objected     to   the     original    charge     because    he\n\nmistakenly believed the term \"knowingly\" was not included. Sabetta\n\nnever objected that the term \"knowingly\" was not defined. Thus, we\n\nreview any error resulting from the absence of the definition of\n\nthe term \"knowingly\" for plain error. See Paniagua-Ramos, 251 F.3d\n\nat 246.\n\n              To   prove   the    crime   of    felon     in     possession,    the\n\nprosecution, obviously, must prove possession.                  To do so under 18\n\nU.S.C.    §   924(a)(2),    the   prosecution     must    establish     that    the\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fdefendant \"knowingly\" possessed the firearm.            Although the court\n\ninstructed the jury that it must find that the defendant \"knowingly\n\npossessed the firearm,\" the defendant argues it was error not to\n\ndefine the term \"knowingly\" as an \"act . . . done voluntarily and\n\nintentionally, not because of mistake or accident.\"               This circuit\n\nhas never required that the term \"knowingly\" be defined when\n\ninstructing   the   jury   on   the    charge   of   felon   in   possession.2\n\nRather, this circuit has generally held that terms a reasonable\n\njury can understand do not need further definition.                Cf. United\n\nStates v. Adams, 305 F.3d 30, 34 (1st Cir. 2002) (stating that the\n\nterm \"altered\" is \"not some highly obscure or special-purpose term\n\nthat cries out for elaboration\"); United States v. Vega-Figueroa,\n\n234 F.3d 744, 756-57 (1st Cir. 2000) (stating that the terms\n\n\n2\n   Sabetta claims a footnote in Parent, 954 F.2d at 26, n.7,\nrequires that the meaning of the term \"knowingly\" be expounded.\nParent does not so hold. Rather, Parent discussed how a court's\nsupplemental instruction failed adequately to connect the\ndefinition   of  constructive  possession  with   the  scienter\nrequirement, as it had done in the jury's original instruction.\nSee id. at 24, n.2.\n\n    Sabetta also claims that the First Circuit Pattern Jury\nInstructions require the term \"knowingly\" to be defined.       The\nPattern Jury Instructions do include a definition of \"knowingly.\"\nSee Pattern Criminal Jury Instructions for the District Courts of\nthe First Circuit § 4.06 (2003).     As we have previously held,\nhowever, the pattern instructions are precatory, not mandatory.\nSee United States v. Gómez, 255 F.3d 31, 39, n.7 (1st Cir. 2001).\nIndeed, the preface to the Pattern Instructions states that \"it\nbears emphasis that no district judge is required to use the\npattern instructions, and that the Court of Appeals has not in any\nway approved the use of a particular instruction.\"         Pattern\nCriminal Jury Instructions for the District Courts of the First\nCircuit (preface).\n\n                                      -12-\n\f\"organizer,\" \"supervisor\" and \"manager\" are generally understood by\n\nthe average person and do not need defining); United States v.\n\nBlasini-Lluberas, 169 F.3d 57, 67 (1st Cir. 1999) (holding that\n\n\"'materiality' is not such a technical concept outside of the\n\njurors' experience that failure to define it rises to the level of\n\nplain error\"); United States v. Fulmer, 108 F.3d 1486, 1495 (1st\n\nCir. 1997)(stating that the word \"intimidate\" is not outside a\n\njuror's understanding such that failure to define the word would be\n\nan error); United States v. Tormos-Vega, 959 F.2d 1103, 1112 (1st\n\nCir. 1992) (stating that the term \"induce\" does not need to be\n\nelaborated for a jury to understand its meaning).               \"Although\n\nexplicit definition of statutory terms and other legal parlance\n\nsometimes may be helpful in jury instructions, we repeatedly have\n\nheld such elaboration to be unnecessary when, taken in the context\n\nof the charge as a whole and the evidence in the case, the tenor of\n\na word or phrase is reasonably clear.\"         United States v. Alicea,\n\n205 F.3d 480, 484 (1st Cir. 2000).       The term \"knowingly,\" as it was\n\nused   in   this   jury   instruction,    could   reasonably   have   been\n\nunderstood by a lay jury and further definition of the term was\n\nunnecessary.   See United States v. Gary, 341 F.3d 829, 834-35 (8th\n\nCir. 2003), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 1128 (2004) (holding that the\n\nterm \"knowingly,\" as it is used in § 922(g), is within the\n\nunderstanding of the lay juror).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\f          D.     Admission of testimony\n\n          Andino, who had pleaded guilty to the charge of felon in\n\npossession, testified at Sabetta's trial regarding the incidents\n\nthat occurred subsequent to Andino's being attacked.           Andino\n\ntestified that he called Sabetta so that \"we can take care of\n\nthat.\"   The prosecutor inquired what \"take care of that\" meant.\n\nSabetta's counsel promptly objected on the basis of relevance and\n\nthe objection was overruled.\n\n          Andino then explained that:      \"I wanted to retaliate, and\n\nI had a gun but it didn't work, and I wanted basically [Sabetta's]\n\nhelp to get the kids back.\"       The prosecutor then asked Andino\n\n\"[w]hat help were you looking for?\"       Defense counsel objected and\n\nwas overruled.    Andino replied that \"I wanted to use his gun.\"   The\n\nprosecutor asked, \"[t]o do what?\"       Defense counsel objected again\n\non the basis of relevance and was again overruled by the judge, who\n\nstated \"it's relevant.\"     Andino finally replied, \"I was angry.    I\n\nwanted to shoot both of the kids that jumped me.\"         Andino also\n\ntestified that before embarking on their mission, Sabetta handed\n\nAndino Sabetta's gun and then Andino placed the gun in a secret\n\ncompartment behind the glove compartment.\n\n          Defense counsel moved to strike Andino's statement that\n\nhe wanted to shoot his attackers.         The trial judge denied the\n\nmotion to strike.      We review a trial court's decision to admit\n\n\n\n\n                                 -14-\n\ftestimony for abuse of discretion.         United States v. Smith, 292\n\nF.3d 90, 98 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          Sabetta contends that Andino's testimony had no probative\n\nvalue because the fact that Andino wanted to shoot his attackers\n\nhad no relation to whether Sabetta possessed a gun.            Sabetta\n\nfurther contends that even if there was probative value to Andino's\n\ntestimony, it was substantially outweighed by the prejudicial\n\naffect of the testimony.\n\n          \"Only   rarely   --   and   in   extraordinarily   compelling\n\ncircumstances -- will we, from the vista of a cold appellate\n\nrecord, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning\n\nthe relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\"\n\nSmith, 292 F.3d at 99 (quoting Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865\n\nF.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir. 1988) (quotation marks omitted)).         We\n\nrefuse to do so here.\n\n          Evidence that pertains \"to a chain of events forming the\n\ncontext . . . and set-up of the crime, helping to complete the\n\nstory of the crime on trial . . . [is admissible in appropriate\n\ncases] . . . where it possesse[s] contextual significance.\" United\n\nStates v. Ladd, 885 F.2d 954, 959 (1st Cir. 1989) (quotations,\n\ncitations, and footnote omitted) (first ellipses in original). The\n\ntestimony that Andino wanted to shoot his attackers explains\n\ntestimony in the record.   For example, Andino's testimony explains\n\nwhy Andino asked Sabetta to bring his gun and why there was a gun\n\n\n                                 -15-\n\fin the car.     See, e.g., United States v. Weems, 322 F.3d 18, 25\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (testimony that house was a drug house admissible\n\nbecause it gave the defendant a motive to possess a gun); Smith,\n\n292 F.3d at 99 (evidence of drug dealing provided motive for\n\nconstructive possession of a gun).         As the district court stated,\n\n\"[i]t's probative . . . because [it explains] why Andino wanted the\n\ngun.   It's all part of the whole procedure that was taking place.\"\n\n            The fact that Andino wanted to shoot his attackers is\n\nprejudicial to Andino and, perhaps, could also be prejudicial to\n\nSabetta, as a friend of Andino.         The district court was within its\n\ndiscretion in concluding that any potential prejudice Andino's\n\ntestimony    caused     Sabetta   was   outweighed   by   the   testimony's\n\nprobative value of explaining the chain of events. As the district\n\ncourt stated, \"[a]ll evidence is prejudicial to [Sabetta] that puts\n\nhim in possession of that gun . . . [b]ut it's not unfairly\n\nprejudicial.\"    As a result, we find that the trial court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in determining that the probative value of\n\nAndino's testimony outweighed any prejudicial effect.\n\n                             III.   Conclusion\n\n            Sabetta's conviction and sentence are therefore affirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f",

The district court sentenced him to 262 months in prison and a five year term of supervised release. Sabetta appeals, claiming that the district court erred by: (1) responding to a jury question without first showing or reading the jury note to counsel; (2) responding to the jury's question by using an example involving the facts of the case; (3) failing to define the term \"knowingly\"; and (4) admitting certain testimony. After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning on September 1, 2000, Sabetta, Daniel Andino, and Sabetta's girlfriend were going out to eat. While leaving his Cranston, Rhode Island home, Sabetta encountered James Corio and Christopher Colardo. A fight ensued in the front yard. Neighbors called the police and reported the disturbance. The police arrived to investigate. By the time they arrived, however, Sabetta was no longer at the scene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the afternoon of September 1, Andino was attacked by two men in connection with a separate dispute. Andino called Sabetta and told him about the altercation. He asked Sabetta if Sabetta would drive Andino's car and help Andino look for his attackers. Sabetta agreed and drove Andino's car in search of Andino's attackers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also in the afternoon of September 1, Colardo's mother and sister went to the police station to inform the police that Sabetta had possessed a gun during the early morning fight. Neither Colardo's mother nor any of the other witnesses interviewed by the police earlier that day had mentioned a gun. Colardo's mother gave the police the make, model, and license number of Andino's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the evening of September 1, while Sabetta and Andino were searching for Andino's attackers, a Cranston police officer, responding to Colardo's report, stopped Andino's car, which Sabetta was driving. The police searched the car and found a gun in a hidden compartment behind the glove compartment. Sabetta and Andino were arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sabetta was charged in federal district court with being a felon in possession of a firearm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On April 6, 2001, Sabetta was convicted and sentenced. Sabetta appealed his conviction, and this court reversed and remanded for a new trial after the government conceded that some of the prosecutor's closing remarks were improper and prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 7, 2003, Sabetta's second trial commenced. Sabetta was again convicted and sentenced. He appeals the conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The jury's note</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 13, 2003, after five days of trial, the jury retired to deliberate. After deliberating for three hours, the trial judge was informed that the jury had two questions. The trial judge brought the jury back into the courtroom. With all parties present, the trial judge learned, for the first time, that the jury had reduced its questions to writing. The judge read the note and stated: \"Your first question is, what is the definition of possession ... [and][t]he second question is, does being in a vehicle that contains a concealed firearm constitute possession?\" Without giving counsel an opportunity to discuss possible answers to the jury questions, the judge answered them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately after the jury left the courtroom to deliberate further, the judge asked the lawyers if \"anyone want[s] to put anything on the record?\" Defense counsel stated he wanted to \"think for a second\" and then stated that he had no objection. Forty minutes later, the jury found the defendant guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In this circuit, the</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">preferred practice for handling a jury message should include these steps: (1) the jury's communique should be reduced to writing; (2) the note should be marked as an exhibit for identification; (3) it should be shown, or read fully, to counsel; and (4) counsel should be given an opportunity to suggest an appropriate rejoinder. If the note requires a response <i>ore tenus,</i> the jury should then be recalled, the note read into the record or summarized by the court, the supplemental instructions given, and counsel afforded an opportunity to object at side-bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Maraj,</i> 947 F.2d 520, 525 (1st Cir.1991) (footnote omitted); <i>see also Shields v. United States,</i> 273 U.S. 583, 588, 47 S.Ct. 478, 71 L.Ed. 787 (1927) (holding that \"[w]here a jury has retired to consider of its verdict, and supplementary instructions are required ... they ought to be given either in the presence of counsel or after notice and an opportunity to be present\"). In the case before us, the jury note was not marked as an exhibit, and counsel was not given an opportunity to suggest an appropriate rejoinder before the trial judge answered the jury's questions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite the supplemental instructions being given in a manner contrary to circuit practice, a trial court's error will not require reversal if the error is harmless. <i>See United States v. Parent,</i> 954 F.2d 23, 25 (1st Cir.1992) (stating that \"a trial court's error in failing seasonably to inform counsel about a jury note does not require reversal if the error is benign\"). This circuit has not yet taken a position on which harmless error standard applies when a trial court fails to disclose or discuss a note from a deliberating jury. <i>See Parent</i> at 25, n. 5; <i>Maraj,</i> 947 F.2d at 526. Either the stricter standard, asking whether the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, <i>see Chapman v. California,</i> 386 U.S. 18, 24, 87 S.Ct. 824, 17 L.Ed.2d 705 (1967), or the more lenient standard, asking whether the error had substantial and injurious effect or influence vis-a-vis the judgment, <i>see Kotteakos v. United States,</i> 328 U.S. 750, 776, 66 S.Ct. 1239, 90 L.Ed. 1557 (1946), applies. Yet again, we need not decide which standard applies as the error in this case was harmless under either standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial judge's failure to allow counsel to suggest an appropriate rejoinder was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because counsel was present when the jury's questions were read and answered. <i>Cf. Rogers v. United States,</i> 422 U.S. 35, 39, 95 S.Ct. 2091, 45 L.Ed.2d 1 (1975) (harmful error for court to respond to a jury note without informing counsel of the note); <i>Parent,</i> 954 F.2d at 27 (same); <i>United States v. Neff,</i> 10 F.3d 1321, 1322 (7th Cir.1993) (same). Defense counsel thus had the opportunity to object or to request a side-bar had he believed the judge's answers to be incorrect or unfairly prejudicial. <i>See Maraj,</i> 947 F.2d at 525 (stating that \"[i]f the note requires a response <i>ore tenus</i>... the supplemental instructions [should be] given, and counsel afforded an opportunity to object at side-bar\"). Unlike cases where the defendant was \"kept in the dark\" regarding the existence or content of the jury's note, in this case Sabetta's counsel had the ability to object before the jury's note was read, after the jury's note was read, during the court's rejoinder, or after the court's rejoinder. <i>Compare Parent,</i> 954 F.2d at 24 (counsel was \"kept in the dark\" regarding jury's note and judge's reply). Being present when the jury's note was first read and answered also afforded Sabetta's counsel the opportunity to \"prime the pump of persuasion,\" had he been inclined to do so. <i>See Parent,</i> 954 F.2d at 24 (stating that not having the opportunity to \"prime the pump of persuasion\" can be an injury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it may be possible for a harmful error to occur even when counsel has an opportunity to object, in this case it is clear that there was no such error. Once the jury retired, the trial judge asked if \"anyone want[s] to put anything on the record.\" After taking a moment to think about it, defense counsel stated he had no objection to the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we hold that the district court committed an error by not giving Sabetta an opportunity to suggest an appropriate rejoinder before the trial judge answered the jury's questions, but such an error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See Maraj,</i> 947 F.2d at 526 (holding that an error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the \"judge's comments were neither unduly coercive nor arguably unsatisfactory. Moreover, had the full note been contemporaneously disclosed, there was nothing more that defense counsel could appropriately have done.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The judge's rejoinder</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sabetta contends that the trial judge's answer to the second question in the jury note invaded the province of the jury as the finder of fact and thus violated his Sixth Amendment right to a trial by jury. The second question posed by the jury was \"[D]oes being in a vehicle that contains a concealed firearm constitute possession?\" The judge responded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Now I discussed constructive possession with you, and I think that comes up as a result of your second question here.... [T]here's several requirements for constructive possession. If, for example, someone is in a vehicle and knows, knows that a gun is in the glove compartment, and has the intention to exercise dominion and control over that item, that's constructive possession. So that illustrates the difference between constructive possession and actual possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Sabetta's counsel did not object to this instruction at trial, we review for plain error. <i>See United States v. Paniagua-Ramos,</i> 251 F.3d 242, 246 (1st Cir.2001). \"The plain error hurdle, high in all events, nowhere looms larger than in the context of alleged instructional errors.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted). Under the plain error standard, Sabetta must establish \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001) (citations omitted). Review of an erroneous jury instruction is evaluated in light of the entire charge. <i>Jones v. United States,</i> 527 U.S. 373, 390-91, 119 S.Ct. 2090, 144 L.Ed.2d 370 (1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sixth Amendment grants a defendant in a criminal case the right to a trial by jury. A district court must use extreme caution in answering questions from juries so as not to usurp the jury's fact finding role. As we have noted on many occasions, \"undeniably inherent in the constitutional guarantee of trial by jury is the principle that a court may not step in and direct a finding of contested fact in favor of the prosecution regardless of how overwhelmingly the evidence may point in that direction.\" <i>United States v. Rivera-Santiago,</i> 107 F.3d 960, 965 (1st Cir.1997) (citations and quotations omitted); <i>United States v. Argentine,</i> 814 F.2d 783, 788 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the trial judge's response to the jury's question was not ideal. Instead of re-reading the definition of constructive possession for the jury, the judge used an example, involving the scenario in the case, to illustrate the definition of constructive possession. Despite the trial judge's poor selection of an example based on the facts of the case, the judge's answer to the jury's question did not usurp the jury's fact finding role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial, the prosecution attempted to prove that Sabetta knew the gun was in the glove compartment and that he intended to exercise control over the gun. The defense attempted to prove that Sabetta was merely in a car that contained a concealed weapon. The jury, unclear about the requirements of constructive possession, inquired if \"being in a vehicle that contains a concealed firearm constitute[s] possession.\" In response, the trial judge properly informed the jury that \"there's several requirements for constructive possession.\" The judge then explained that constructive possession exists \"[i]f, for example, someone is in a vehicle and knows, knows that a gun is in the glove compartment, and has the intention to exercise dominion and control over that item.\" The jury, as the finder of fact, was required to determine whether the defendant knew that a gun was in the glove compartment and whether the defendant had the intention to exercise dominion and control over the gun. The judge's rejoinder did not answer either of these questions for the jury. <i>Compare Rivera-Santiago,</i> 107 F.3d at 965-66 (holding that an error occurred because the judge's answer encouraged the jury to believe certain testimony); <i>United States v. Argentine,</i> 814 F.2d 783, 787 (1st Cir.1987) (holding that an error occurred because the \"judge's handling of the jury question relieved the prosecution of [its] burden in an unfair way\"). Although it would have been preferable for the judge to limit his rejoinder to re-reading the definition of constructive possession, the judge's rejoinder did not constitute plain error because the judge did not usurp the jury's fact finding role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. Defining the term \"knowingly\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court instructed the jury that the crime of felon in possession of a firearm requires that the defendant \"knowingly possessed the firearm in question.\" The court then explained that actual possession occurs when \"a person ... knowingly has direct physical control over a thing at a given time.\" The court explained that constructive possession occurs when \"[a] person who, although not in actual possession, knowingly has both the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion or control over a thing, either directly or through another person, or persons.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sabetta's counsel originally objected to this charge because he \"didn't hear knowledge of the presence of the firearm\" in the court's definition of possession. In response to this objection, the trial judge informed counsel that the instructions contained the phrase \"knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion or control.\" Upon hearing this, defense counsel dropped the issue and replied \"[t]hank you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Sabetta argues that the trial court erred because it failed to define the term \"knowingly.\" During the trial, Sabetta objected to the original charge because he mistakenly believed the term \"knowingly\" was not included. Sabetta never objected that the term \"knowingly\" was not defined. Thus, we review any error resulting from the absence of the definition of the term \"knowingly\" for plain error. <i>See Paniagua-Ramos,</i> 251 F.3d at 246.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove the crime of felon in possession, the prosecution, obviously, must prove possession. To do so under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(a)(2), the prosecution must establish that the defendant \"knowingly\" possessed the firearm. Although the court instructed the jury that it must find that the defendant \"knowingly possessed the firearm,\" the defendant argues it was error not to define the term \"knowingly\" as an \"act ... done voluntarily and intentionally, not because of mistake or accident.\" This circuit has never required that the term \"knowingly\" be defined when instructing the jury on the charge of felon in possession.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Rather, this circuit has generally held that terms a reasonable jury can understand do not need further definition. <i>Cf. United States v. Adams,</i> 305 F.3d 30, 34 (1st Cir.2002) (stating that the term \"altered\" is \"not some highly obscure or special-purpose term that cries out for elaboration\"); <i>United States v. Vega-Figueroa,</i> 234 F.3d 744, 756-57 (1st Cir.2000) (stating that the terms \"organizer,\" \"supervisor\" and \"manager\" are generally understood by the average person and do not need defining); <i>United States v. Blasini-Lluberas,</i> 169 F.3d 57, 67 (1st Cir.1999) (holding that \"`materiality' is not such a technical concept outside of the jurors' experience that failure to define it rises to the level of plain error\"); <i>United States v. Fulmer,</i> 108 F.3d 1486, 1495 (1st Cir.1997)(stating that the word \"intimidate\" is not outside a juror's understanding such that failure to define the word would be an error); <i>United States v.

Admission of testimony</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andino, who had pleaded guilty to the charge of felon in possession, testified at Sabetta's trial regarding the incidents that occurred subsequent to Andino's being attacked. Andino testified that he called Sabetta so that \"we can take care of that.\" The prosecutor inquired what \"take care of that\" meant. Sabetta's counsel promptly objected on the basis of relevance and the objection was overruled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andino then explained that: \"I wanted to retaliate, and I had a gun but it didn't work, and I wanted basically [Sabetta's] help to get the kids back.\" The prosecutor then asked Andino \"[w]hat help were you looking for?\" Defense counsel objected and was overruled. Andino replied that \"I wanted to use his gun.\" The prosecutor asked, \"[t]o do what?\" Defense counsel objected again on the basis of relevance and was again overruled by the judge, who stated \"it's relevant.\" Andino finally replied, \"I was angry. I wanted to shoot both of the kids that jumped me.\" Andino also testified that before embarking on their mission, Sabetta handed Andino Sabetta's gun and then Andino placed the gun in a secret compartment behind the glove compartment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel moved to strike Andino's statement that he wanted to shoot his attackers. The trial judge denied the motion to strike. We review a trial court's decision to admit testimony for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 292 F.3d 90, 98 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sabetta contends that Andino's testimony had no probative value because the fact that Andino wanted to shoot his attackers had no relation to whether Sabetta possessed a gun. Sabetta further contends that even if there was probative value to Andino's testimony, it was substantially outweighed by the prejudicial affect of the testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Only rarely &#8212; and in extraordinarily compelling circumstances &#8212; will we, from the vista of a cold appellate record, reverse a district court's on-the-spot judgment concerning the relative weighing of probative value and unfair effect.\" <i>Smith,</i> 292 F.3d at 99 (quoting <i>Freeman v. Package Mach. Co.,</i> 865 F.2d 1331, 1340 (1st Cir.1988) (quotation marks omitted)). We refuse to do so here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence that pertains \"to a chain of events forming the context ... and set-up of the crime, helping to complete the story of the crime on trial ...

Ladd,</i> 885 F.2d 954, 959 (1st Cir.1989) (quotations, citations, and footnote omitted) (first ellipses in original). The testimony that Andino wanted to shoot his attackers explains testimony in the record. For example, Andino's testimony explains why Andino asked Sabetta to bring his gun and why there was a gun in the car. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Weems,</i> 322 F.3d 18, 25 (1st Cir.2003) (testimony that house was a drug house admissible because it gave the defendant a motive to possess a gun); <i>Smith,</i> 292 F.3d at 99 (evidence of drug dealing provided motive for constructive possession of a gun). As the district court stated, \"[i]t's probative... because [it explains] why Andino wanted the gun. It's all part of the whole procedure that was taking place.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact that Andino wanted to shoot his attackers is prejudicial to Andino and, perhaps, could also be prejudicial to Sabetta, as a friend of Andino. The district court was within its discretion in concluding that any potential prejudice Andino's testimony caused Sabetta was outweighed by the testimony's probative value of explaining the chain of events. As the district court stated, \"[a]ll evidence is prejudicial to [Sabetta] that puts him in possession of that gun ... [b]ut it's not unfairly prejudicial.\" As a result, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the probative value of Andino's testimony outweighed any prejudicial effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sabetta's conviction and sentence are therefore affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Sabetta stipulated that he was a convicted felon as defined by 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g) and 924(e)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Sabetta claims a footnote in<i>Parent,</i> 954 F.2d at 26, n. 7, requires that the meaning of the term \"knowingly\" be expounded. <i>Parent</i> does not so hold.

After careful review, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early morning on September 1, 2000, Sabetta, Daniel Andino, and Sabetta's girlfriend were going out to eat. While leaving his Cranston, Rhode Island home, Sabetta encountered James Corio and Christopher Colardo. A fight ensued in the front yard. Neighbors called the police and reported the disturbance. The police arrived to investigate. By the time they arrived, however, Sabetta was no longer at the scene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the afternoon of September 1, Andino was attacked by two men in connection with a separate dispute. Andino called Sabetta and told him about the altercation. He asked Sabetta if Sabetta would drive Andino's car and help Andino look for his attackers. Sabetta agreed and drove Andino's car in search of Andino's attackers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also in the afternoon of September 1, Colardo's mother and sister went to the police station to inform the police that Sabetta had possessed a gun during the early morning fight. Neither Colardo's mother nor any of the other witnesses interviewed by the police earlier that day had mentioned a gun. Colardo's mother gave the police the make, model, and license number of Andino's car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the evening of September 1, while Sabetta and Andino were searching for Andino's attackers, a Cranston police officer, responding to Colardo's report, stopped Andino's car, which Sabetta was driving. The police searched the car and found a gun in a hidden compartment behind the glove compartment. Sabetta and Andino were arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sabetta was charged in federal district court with being a felon in possession of a firearm.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On April 6, 2001, Sabetta was convicted and sentenced. Sabetta appealed his conviction, and this court reversed and remanded for a new trial after the government conceded that some of the prosecutor's closing remarks were improper and prejudicial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 7, 2003, Sabetta's second trial commenced.

The jury's note</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 13, 2003, after five days of trial, the jury retired to deliberate. After deliberating for three hours, the trial judge was informed that the jury had two questions. The trial judge brought the jury back into the courtroom. With all parties present, the trial judge learned, for the first time, that the jury had reduced its questions to writing. The judge read the note and stated: \"Your first question is, what is the definition of possession ... [and][t]he second question is, does being in a vehicle that contains a concealed firearm constitute possession?\" Without giving counsel an opportunity to discuss possible answers to the jury questions, the judge answered them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Immediately after the jury left the courtroom to deliberate further, the judge asked the lawyers if \"anyone want[s] to put anything on the record?\" Defense counsel stated he wanted to \"think for a second\" and then stated that he had no objection. Forty minutes later, the jury found the defendant guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In this circuit, the</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">preferred practice for handling a jury message should include these steps: (1) the jury's communique should be reduced to writing; (2) the note should be marked as an exhibit for identification; (3) it should be shown, or read fully, to counsel; and (4) counsel should be given an opportunity to suggest an appropriate rejoinder. If the note requires a response <i>ore tenus,</i> the jury should then be recalled, the note read into the record or summarized by the court, the supplemental instructions given, and counsel afforded an opportunity to object at side-bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

Defense counsel thus had the opportunity to object or to request a side-bar had he believed the judge's answers to be incorrect or unfairly prejudicial. <i>See Maraj,</i> 947 F.2d at 525 (stating that \"[i]f the note requires a response <i>ore tenus</i>... the supplemental instructions [should be] given, and counsel afforded an opportunity to object at side-bar\"). Unlike cases where the defendant was \"kept in the dark\" regarding the existence or content of the jury's note, in this case Sabetta's counsel had the ability to object before the jury's note was read, after the jury's note was read, during the court's rejoinder, or after the court's rejoinder. <i>Compare Parent,</i> 954 F.2d at 24 (counsel was \"kept in the dark\" regarding jury's note and judge's reply). Being present when the jury's note was first read and answered also afforded Sabetta's counsel the opportunity to \"prime the pump of persuasion,\" had he been inclined to do so. <i>See Parent,</i> 954 F.2d at 24 (stating that not having the opportunity to \"prime the pump of persuasion\" can be an injury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although it may be possible for a harmful error to occur even when counsel has an opportunity to object, in this case it is clear that there was no such error. Once the jury retired, the trial judge asked if \"anyone want[s] to put anything on the record.\" After taking a moment to think about it, defense counsel stated he had no objection to the instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a result, we hold that the district court committed an error by not giving Sabetta an opportunity to suggest an appropriate rejoinder before the trial judge answered the jury's questions, but such an error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See Maraj,</i> 947 F.2d at 526 (holding that an error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt because the \"judge's comments were neither unduly coercive nor arguably unsatisfactory. Moreover, had the full note been contemporaneously disclosed, there was nothing more that defense counsel could appropriately have done.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

Instead of re-reading the definition of constructive possession for the jury, the judge used an example, involving the scenario in the case, to illustrate the definition of constructive possession. Despite the trial judge's poor selection of an example based on the facts of the case, the judge's answer to the jury's question did not usurp the jury's fact finding role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the trial, the prosecution attempted to prove that Sabetta knew the gun was in the glove compartment and that he intended to exercise control over the gun. The defense attempted to prove that Sabetta was merely in a car that contained a concealed weapon. The jury, unclear about the requirements of constructive possession, inquired if \"being in a vehicle that contains a concealed firearm constitute[s] possession.\" In response, the trial judge properly informed the jury that \"there's several requirements for constructive possession.\" The judge then explained that constructive possession exists \"[i]f, for example, someone is in a vehicle and knows, knows that a gun is in the glove compartment, and has the intention to exercise dominion and control over that item.\" The jury, as the finder of fact, was required to determine whether the defendant knew that a gun was in the glove compartment and whether the defendant had the intention to exercise dominion and control over the gun. The judge's rejoinder did not answer either of these questions for the jury. <i>Compare Rivera-Santiago,</i> 107 F.3d at 965-66 (holding that an error occurred because the judge's answer encouraged the jury to believe certain testimony); <i>United States v. Argentine,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"485237\"><a href=\"/opinion/485237/united-states-v-alfred-argentine/\"><span class=\"volume\">814</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span>, 787 (1st Cir.1987) (holding that an error occurred because the \"judge's handling of the jury question relieved the prosecution of [its] burden in an unfair way\"). Although it would have been preferable for the judge to limit his rejoinder to re-reading the definition of constructive possession, the judge's rejoinder did not constitute plain error because the judge did not usurp the jury's fact finding role.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C.

In response to this objection, the trial judge informed counsel that the instructions contained the phrase \"knowingly has the power and intention at a given time to exercise dominion or control.\" Upon hearing this, defense counsel dropped the issue and replied \"[t]hank you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Sabetta argues that the trial court erred because it failed to define the term \"knowingly.\" During the trial, Sabetta objected to the original charge because he mistakenly believed the term \"knowingly\" was not included. Sabetta never objected that the term \"knowingly\" was not defined. Thus, we review any error resulting from the absence of the definition of the term \"knowingly\" for plain error. <i>See Paniagua-Ramos,</i> 251 F.3d at 246.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove the crime of felon in possession, the prosecution, obviously, must prove possession. To do so under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(a)(2), the prosecution must establish that the defendant \"knowingly\" possessed the firearm. Although the court instructed the jury that it must find that the defendant \"knowingly possessed the firearm,\" the defendant argues it was error not to define the term \"knowingly\" as an \"act ... done voluntarily and intentionally, not because of mistake or accident.\" This circuit has never required that the term \"knowingly\" be defined when instructing the jury on the charge of felon in possession.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Rather, this circuit has generally held that terms a reasonable jury can understand do not need further definition. <i>Cf.

The testimony that Andino wanted to shoot his attackers explains testimony in the record. For example, Andino's testimony explains why Andino asked Sabetta to bring his gun and why there was a gun in the car. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Weems,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"781157\"><a href=\"/opinion/781157/united-states-v-ike-weems/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.2003) (testimony that house was a drug house admissible because it gave the defendant a motive to possess a gun); <i>Smith,</i> 292 F.3d at 99 (evidence of drug dealing provided motive for constructive possession of a gun).

The district court was within its discretion in concluding that any potential prejudice Andino's testimony caused Sabetta was outweighed by the testimony's probative value of explaining the chain of events. As the district court stated, \"[a]ll evidence is prejudicial to [Sabetta] that puts him in possession of that gun ... [b]ut it's not unfairly prejudicial.\" As a result, we find that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the probative value of Andino's testimony outweighed any prejudicial effect.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sabetta's conviction and sentence are therefore affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Sabetta stipulated that he was a convicted felon as defined by 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g) and 924(e)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Sabetta claims a footnote in<i>Parent,</i> 954 F.2d at 26, n. 7, requires that the meaning of the term \"knowingly\" be expounded. <i>Parent</i> does not so hold.
