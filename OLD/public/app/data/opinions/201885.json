This is a petition for review of the denial\n\nof asylum.1    Petitioner, a native and citizen of Cambodia had\n\nsought asylum on the ground that he had been persecuted in the past\n\non the basis of his membership in particular social groups, namely,\n\nthe   Khmer   People   National   Liberation     Front    (\"KPNLF\"),     the\n\nDemocratic Liberal Buddhism Party (\"DLBP\"), and the Sam Rainsey\n\nParty (\"SRP\"), all of which opposed the incumbent Hun Sen regime,\n\nand that he feared that, if he returned to Cambodia, he would be\n\nimmediately arrested and probably killed because of his active\n\nmembership in the SRP.     Where, as here, the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals   (\"BIA\")   has   summarily   affirmed   the     decision   of   the\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\"), we review the findings and conclusions of\n\nthe IJ.   Keo v. Ashcroft, 341 F.3d 57, 60 (1st Cir. 2003).         Finding\n\nno error in the IJ's decision that the petitioner is statutorily\n\nineligible for asylum, we deny the petition.\n\n           To be entitled to asylum, an applicant bears the burden\n\nof proving that he is a \"refugee.\"      See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(42)(A),\n\n1158(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a); see also Xu v. Gonzales, 424\n\nF.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 2005).          To do that, the applicant must\n\n\n\n      1\n      The Immigration Judge also denied petitioner's claims for\nwithholding of removal and for relief under the Convention Against\nTorture (\"CAT\"). However, because petitioner did not press those\nclaims on appeal to the Board of Immigration Appeals and did not\nraise his CAT claim or develop his withholding of removal claim in\nhis brief to this court, those claims are therefore waived. See Un\nv. Gonzales, 415 F.3d 205, 210 (1st Cir. 2005); Harutyunyan v.\nGonzales, 421 F.3d 64, 65 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                  -2-\n\fdemonstrate either a well-founded fear of future persecution on\n\naccount of a protected ground, such as membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, or past persecution on account of such a ground,\n\nwhich entitles the applicant to a presumption of a well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution.      See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b); see also\n\nXu, 424 F.3d at 48.\n\n            Establishing past persecution is a \"daunting task,\" Diab\n\nv. Ashcroft, 397 F.3d 35, 39 (1st Cir. 2005).             To make such a\n\nshowing, the applicant must provide \"conclusive evidence\" that he\n\nhas   suffered   persecution   on   a     protected   ground,   Romilus   v.\n\nAshcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2004); conclusory allegations are\n\nnot sufficient, Negeya v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 78, 83 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).   Because \"persecution\" is not a defined term, \"it is in the\n\nfirst instance the prerogative of the Attorney General, acting\n\nthrough the BIA, to give content to it.\"         Bocova v. Gonzales, 412\n\nF.3d 257, 262 (1st Cir. 2005).      Although the BIA does so on a case-\n\nby-case basis, id. at 263, it is clear that, \"'to qualify as\n\npersecution, a person's experience must rise above unpleasantness,\n\nharassment, and even basic suffering,'\" Ziu v. Gonzales, 412 F.3d\n\n202, 2204 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263\n\n(1st Cir. 2000)).\n\n            Where an applicant has not proved past persecution and\n\ntherefore    does   not   benefit    from    a   presumption    of   future\n\npersecution, the applicant must satisfy both a subjective and an\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fobjective test to prove a well-founded fear of future persecution.\n\nDiab, 397 F.3d at 39. \"'The subjective test requires the applicant\n\nto prove his fear is genuine, while the objective test requires a\n\nshowing   by     credible   and   specific   evidence    that   this   fear    is\n\nreasonable.'\"      Id. (quoting Mukamusoni v. Ashcroft, 390 F.3d 110,\n\n119 (1st Cir. 2004)).\n\n            We    review    administrative   asylum     decisions    under    the\n\n\"highly deferential 'substantial evidence' standard.                Harutyunyan\n\nv. Gonzales, 421 F.3d 64, 67 (1st Cir. 2005).           Where, as here, \"the\n\nagency's determination . . . is based, not on substantial evidence\n\nsupporting its decision, but on a petitioner's failure to provide\n\nevidence that would support a holding his favor. . ., 'substantial\n\nevidence' review permits [the court] to reverse 'only if the\n\npetitioner's evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to\n\nconclude that relief was warranted.'\"          Xu, 424 F.3d at 48 (quoting\n\nSettenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004)).\n\n            Under those deferential standards, we must deny the\n\npetition.      The record evidence does not compel the conclusion\n\neither that petitioner was persecuted in the past or that he has an\n\nobjectively reasonable fear of being persecuted in the future.\n\n            As to past persecution, the IJ reasonably concluded that\n\nthe incidents cited by the petitioner do not rise to the level of\n\n\"persecution\" for purposes of asylum eligibility.                Although the\n\npetitioner cites three incidents of having a gun pointed at him and\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fone incident of receiving a threatening letter, he was not harmed\n\nin any of those confrontations, and the threat was not particularly\n\ncredible and was never fulfilled even though petitioner remained in\n\nCambodia for two and a half years after receiving it.                      See Ziu, 412\n\nF.3d at 205 (finding that two episodes of physical abuse not\n\nresulting in serious injury and various threats \"do not amount to\n\npersecution under our case law\"); cf. Un, 415 F.3d at 209-10, 210\n\nn.3 (holding that verbal death threat could amount to persecution,\n\nwhere    a    credible       friend     confirmed     that      the   threateners      were\n\nplanning to kill the petitioner). Petitioner's general allegations\n\nthat he was often threatened by Hun Sen's followers and followed by\n\nthe secret police are not sufficiently specific to fulfill his\n\nburden       of    providing    \"conclusive\"        and    \"specific\"      evidence     of\n\npersecution.          See Topalli v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 128, 132 n.5 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n                  Nor does the evidence compel a finding that the incidents\n\nwhere    petitioner       was    held    at    gunpoint      were     motivated   by   his\n\npolitical party membership.              At the first such confrontation, the\n\nsoldiers stated that they had stopped petitioner's van because of\n\na curfew violation; and at the second, they stated that petitioner\n\nand others had violated \"local law.\"                   In the third incident, no\n\nreason    was       given.      Given    the    absence    of    even    circumstantial\n\nevidence      of     motive,    the     IJ    was   free   to    reject    petitioner's\n\n\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\fspeculation     that    the   incidents    were   motivated   by   his   party\n\nmembership.     Ziu, 412 F.3d at 205.\n\n           As to future persecution, even assuming, as the IJ\n\nimplicitly did, that petitioner's fear of future persecution is\n\nsubjectively sincere, the evidence does not compel a finding that\n\npetitioner's fear is objectively reasonable.               The IJ reasonably\n\nconcluded that petitioner would not be viewed as a party activist,\n\nbased on petitioner's own testimony that he had no rank or position\n\nin the SRP but was merely a member and had ceased his active\n\ninvolvement in party activities after the 1998 elections and on the\n\nfact that he was viewed as a government employee, which facilitated\n\nhis movement around the country, even after he had left his\n\ngovernment    position.       Furthermore,    the   2002   State   Department\n\nCountry Condition Report indicates that political parties normally\n\nwere able to conduct their activities freely without government\n\ninterference; that political violence associated with the February\n\n2001 local elections was directed primarily at party activists and\n\ncandidates rather than mere members, see Khem v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d\n\n51, 54 (1st Cir. 2003); that the Government took action against\n\nmany alleged perpetrators of election-related violence; and that\n\nthe SRP won 1,346 local council seats, thus gaining some control\n\nover the country's local governance, id. The IJ properly relied on\n\nthat   report   in     concluding   that   petitioner's     fear   of    future\n\npersecution was not objectively reasonable.            Negeya, 417 F.3d at\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f84-85.   That conclusion is further supported by the fact that\n\npetitioner reported no further problems after March 1998 although\n\nhe remained in Cambodia for more than two years after that.\n\n          Accordingly, the petition is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

See Ziu, 412\n\nF.3d at 205 (finding that two episodes of physical abuse not\n\nresulting in serious injury and various threats \"do not amount to\n\npersecution under our case law\"); cf. Un, 415 F.3d at 209-10, 210\n\nn.3 (holding that verbal death threat could amount to persecution,\n\nwhere    a    credible       friend     confirmed     that      the   threateners      were\n\nplanning to kill the petitioner). Petitioner's general allegations\n\nthat he was often threatened by Hun Sen's followers and followed by\n\nthe secret police are not sufficiently specific to fulfill his\n\nburden       of    providing    \"conclusive\"        and    \"specific\"      evidence     of\n\npersecution.          See Topalli v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201738\"><a href=\"/opinion/201738/topalli-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">417</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 132 n.5 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n                  Nor does the evidence compel a finding that the incidents\n\nwhere    petitioner       was    held    at    gunpoint      were     motivated   by   his\n\npolitical party membership.              At the first such confrontation, the\n\nsoldiers stated that they had stopped petitioner's van because of\n\na curfew violation; and at the second, they stated that petitioner\n\nand others had violated \"local law.\"                   In the third incident, no\n\nreason    was       given.      Given    the    absence    of    even    circumstantial\n\nevidence      of     motive,    the     IJ    was   free   to    reject    petitioner's\n\n\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\fspeculation     that    the   incidents    were   motivated   by   his   party\n\nmembership.     Ziu, 412 F.3d at 205.\n\n           As to future persecution, even assuming, as the IJ\n\nimplicitly did, that petitioner's fear of future persecution is\n\nsubjectively sincere, the evidence does not compel a finding that\n\npetitioner's fear is objectively reasonable.               The IJ reasonably\n\nconcluded that petitioner would not be viewed as a party activist,\n\nbased on petitioner's own testimony that he had no rank or position\n\nin the SRP but was merely a member and had ceased his active\n\ninvolvement in party activities after the 1998 elections and on the\n\nfact that he was viewed as a government employee, which facilitated\n\nhis movement around the country, even after he had left his\n\ngovernment    position.       Furthermore,    the   2002   State   Department\n\nCountry Condition Report indicates that political parties normally\n\nwere able to conduct their activities freely without government\n\ninterference; that political violence associated with the February\n\n2001 local elections was directed primarily at party activists and\n\ncandidates rather than mere members, see Khem v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783401\"><a href=\"/opinion/783401/sovann-khem-v-john-ashcroft-united-states-attorney-general/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 54 (1st Cir. 2003); that the Government took action against\n\nmany alleged perpetrators of election-related violence; and that\n\nthe SRP won 1,346 local council seats, thus gaining some control\n\nover the country's local governance, id. The IJ properly relied on\n\nthat   report   in     concluding   that   petitioner's     fear   of    future\n\npersecution was not objectively reasonable.            Negeya, 417 F.3d at\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f84-85.   That conclusion is further supported by the fact that\n\npetitioner reported no further problems after March 1998 although\n\nhe remained in Cambodia for more than two years after that.\n\n          Accordingly, the petition is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f</pre>",
