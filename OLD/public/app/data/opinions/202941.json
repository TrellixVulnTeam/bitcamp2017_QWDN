Allen on brief for petitioner.\n     Siu P. Wong, Office of Immigration Litigation Trial Attorney,\nPeter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, and        Terri J.\nScandron, Office of Immigration Litigation Assistant Director, on\nbrief for respondent.\n\n\n                        September 17, 2007\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.    The petitioner, Fady Louis Hana,\n\na native and citizen of Egypt, appeals an order of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\") affirming a decision of the Immigration\n\nJudge (\"IJ\") that rejected his application for asylum as untimely,\n\nfound no extraordinary circumstances that would excuse the late\n\nfiling, and denied his claims for withholding of removal and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture.        We affirm the\n\nBIA's decision.\n\n                                   I.\n\n           Hana,   a   Coptic   Christian,   claims   that   he   faced\n\npersecution in Egypt on account of his religion.1      In 2000, Hana,\n\nwho volunteered as a driver for his church’s religious school, was\n\nassaulted by two bearded men while he was waiting for two of his\n\npassengers.   He believes that he was targeted for his religious\n\nviews.   Over the next two years, Hana was twice approached by other\n\nmen who tried to convince him to abandon his church duties by\n\noffering him a higher-paying position or by threatening him.        In\n\nNovember of 2000, after having spent the day delivering pamphlets\n\nto churches, Hana was run off the road by two bearded men driving\n\n\n     1\n       We note that there are several discrepancies between Hana’s\nwritten declaration in his initial application for asylum and his\ntestimony at the removal hearing.       In her decision, the IJ\ndiscussed one such discrepancy (regarding whether an assault on\nJanuary 7, 2000 comprised one or two incidents), but added that\n“[o]ther than [that] discrepancy, the respondent’s testimony was\nconsistent with that in his written statement.” We recount the\nfacts as Hana described them in his oral testimony, except where\notherwise noted.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fa   black   micro-bus;      Hana   was   unable       to   give   the   police   any\n\ninformation about the men or their vehicle.                 The following month,\n\nHana was involved in a more serious accident, when two men who had\n\nbeen following his car for an hour suddenly pulled in front of him\n\nand stopped short, forcing Hana’s car into the back of their\n\nvehicle and Hana’s head through his windshield. Hana did not offer\n\nany evidence suggesting that this accident was related to any of\n\nthe prior incidents or that it was related to his religious\n\nbeliefs.\n\n             Soon after this second accident, Hana sought treatment\n\nfrom   a    psychiatrist,    who   diagnosed      him      as   suffering   from   a\n\npersistent case of depression due to external stress factors in his\n\nenvironment. The psychiatrist prescribed medication, and suggested\n\nthat Hana change his environment.              Hana had obtained a visa prior\n\nto the accident and took the first of two trips to the United\n\nStates,     arriving   on   January      3,    2001   and   returning     to   Egypt\n\napproximately six months later, without attempting to seek asylum.\n\n             Within two weeks of returning to Egypt, Hana received an\n\nanonymous phone call in which the caller told him, “Welcome home.\n\nWe are waiting for you; we won’t forget you.”                     This phone call\n\napparently caused Hana to suffer a nervous breakdown.                   During this\n\nperiod, Hana was visited at home several times by his priest; on\n\none occasion, the priest’s car was vandalized, with the words\n\n“Mohammad is the messenger of Allah” scratched on the side.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f          Frightened by what he viewed as acts of persecution, Hana\n\nleft Egypt for the United States on December 19, 2001 and was\n\nadmitted on a six-month, non-immigrant visa.           After he recovered\n\nfrom this period of extreme mental stress, Hana, who had by then\n\noverstayed his visa, hired a lawyer.        Almost sixteen months after\n\nentering the country, he filed an Application for Asylum and for\n\nWithholding of Removal.      At a hearing before an IJ, Hana conceded\n\nremovability but, in addition to asylum, sought withholding of\n\nremoval under section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality\n\nAct (\"INA\")2 and the Convention Against Torture (“CAT”).             The IJ\n\nissued an oral decision denying Hana's asylum claim because it was\n\nnot   filed   within   the    one-year     deadline,   see    8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1158(a)(2)(B),   and   Hana    had   not   demonstrated      \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\" that would excuse the tardy filing, see id. §\n\n1158(a)(2)(D).   The IJ also rejected Hana's claims for withholding\n\nof removal and protection under the CAT, but granted Hana voluntary\n\ndeparture to leave the country before May 3, 2005.            Hana filed a\n\ntimely appeal to the BIA.      The BIA dismissed his appeal, stating\n\n\n\n      2\n       Section 241(b)(3) provides for withholding of removal if the\n\"Attorney General decides that the alien's life or freedom would be\nthreatened in [the destination country] because of the alien's\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\ngroup, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A). The alien\nbears the burden of proof and must show either that she has\nsuffered past persecution, which creates a rebuttable presumption\nof future persecution, or that \"it is more likely than not that he\nor she would be persecuted\" on account of one of the five\nenumerated grounds if she were removed. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b).\n\n                                     -4-\n\fthat “no clear error has been demonstrated with respect to any\n\nfactual finding” made by the IJ, and reinstated the voluntary\n\ndeparture period.      This appeal followed.\n\n                                     II.\n\n             Hana raises two claims on appeal, the first of which\n\nconcerns his request for asylum.            Both the IJ and the BIA have\n\ndetermined    that    his   asylum   application   was    untimely.      To   be\n\neligible for asylum, an applicant must show by clear and convincing\n\nevidence that he filed his application within one year of arriving\n\nin the United States.        8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B).         Alternatively,\n\nthe applicant may overcome this limitation by demonstrating the\n\nexistence of “extraordinary circumstances” sufficient to merit an\n\nexemption from the one-year deadline.              Id. § 1158(a)(2)(D); 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5) (stating that failure to satisfy the one-year\n\ndeadline may be excused if the alien identifies \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances,\" directly related to the delayed filing, and if the\n\nalien \"filed the application within a reasonable period given those\n\ncircumstances\").\n\nA.   Timeliness of Asylum Application\n\n             Hana first asks us to reverse the BIA's decision to\n\nreject his application on timeliness grounds. Although he concedes\n\nthat   his   asylum   application     was   untimely,    he   argues   that   he\n\npresented “extraordinary circumstances” that excuse the delay,\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D).           Specifically, Hana claims\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthat upon his arrival in the United States, he suffered “extreme\n\nmental distress” (including depression and a nervous breakdown) as\n\na result of the physical harm and threats made against him in\n\nEgypt, and that his mental condition constituted extraordinary\n\ncircumstances.\n\n            We do not have jurisdiction to review the agency's\n\nfindings    regarding       timeliness        or   its   application   of    the\n\n\"extraordinary circumstances\" exception, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3),\n\nunless an alien identifies a legal or constitutional defect in the\n\ndecision.    8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D) (stating that no provision of\n\nthe INA \"which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be\n\nconstrued     as    precluding      review    of   constitutional   claims   or\n\nquestions of law\" raised before the appropriate court of appeals);\n\nsee also Pan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir. 2007)(finding\n\nno jurisdiction over the BIA's determinations that an asylum\n\napplication        was   untimely    and      there   were   no   extraordinary\n\ncircumstances excusing the delay); Sharari v. Gonzales, 407 F.3d\n\n467, 473 (1st Cir. 2005) (noting that the statute's jurisdictional\n\nbar applies both to the BIA's determination that the petition was\n\nuntimely and to its decision that no exception applies).\n\n            Both the IJ and the BIA have determined that there are no\n\nextraordinary circumstances justifying Hana’s delayed application\n\nfor asylum.        We have no jurisdiction to review the rejection of\n\nHana’s asylum application on this ground.\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fB. Due Process and Removal of Jurisdiction\n\n             Hana also argues that Congress has violated his right to\n\ndue   process      by   precluding    our    review     over    asylum      timeliness\n\ndecisions (including \"extraordinary circumstances\" decisions) under\n\n8   U.S.C.    §    1158(a)(3).3       The     Supreme    Court    has       recognized\n\nCongress’s        plenary    power    over    matters     of     immigration          and\n\nnaturalization.         See, e.g., Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 305\n\n(1993) (“‘[O]ver no conceivable subject is the legislative power of\n\nCongress more complete . . . .’” (quoting Oceanic Steam Navig. Co.\n\nV. Stranahan, 214 U.S. 320, 339 (1909))).                Such plenary power has\n\ntraditionally       included     Congress’s      power     to    remove        judicial\n\njurisdiction over executive decisions involving aliens. See, e.g.,\n\nCarlson v. Landon, 342 U.S. 524, 537 (1952) (\"The power to expel\n\naliens, being essentially a power of the political branches of\n\ngovernment,       the   legislative    and     executive,       may    be    exercised\n\nentirely through executive officers, 'with such opportunity for\n\njudicial     review     of   their   action    as   congress     may     see    fit    to\n\nauthorize or permit.'\").          “Deportation,” according to the Supreme\n\n\n\n      3\n       Hana separately contends that the IJ and BIA violated his\nright to due process by failing to provide him with a “fair and\nefficient” procedure for considering his claims.     This argument\nspans only two sentences; the sole authority Hana cites merely\nindicates that the IJ and the BIA should consider the\n“extraordinary circumstances” question on an individualized basis.\nHana has not identified any specific way in which his hearing was\ninadequate or unfair.    Because this claim is perfunctory and\nunaccompanied by developed argumentation, we deem it waived. See\nUnited States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                        -7-\n\fCourt, “is not a criminal proceeding and has never been held to be\n\npunishment . . . [, and thus] [n]o judicial review is guaranteed by\n\nthe Constitution.\"    Id.\n\n          Relying on the Supreme Court’s holding in Carlson, both\n\nthe Third and Ninth Circuits have explicitly rejected the argument\n\nthat the jurisdictional bar of 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3) represents a\n\ndue process violation.      See, e.g., Sukwanputra v. Gonzales, 434\n\nF.3d 627, 632-33 (3d Cir. 2006) (“Because judicial review is not\n\nconstitutionally     guaranteed,   the   judicial   review   bar   of   §\n\n1158(a)(3) does not violate the Due Process Clause.”); Hakeem v.\n\nINS, 273 F.3d 812, 815-16 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that the removal\n\nof jurisdiction over timeliness decisions does not violate the Due\n\nProcess Clause).\n\n          While we have not previously addressed the question\n\nwhether the jurisdictional bar of 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3) represents\n\na due process violation, we have held that removal of judicial\n\nreview in the immigration context does not raise constitutional\n\nissues when some avenue for judicial relief remains available to\n\naddress core legal and constitutional concerns.        See Kolster v.\n\nINS, 101 F.3d 785, 791 (1st Cir. 1996).     We have also held that the\n\none-year deadline for submission of asylum applications does not\n\nviolate aliens' due process rights.      Ticoalu v. Gonzales, 472 F.3d\n\n8, 11 (1st Cir. 2006) (rejecting a due process challenge to the\n\nenforcement of the one-year limitation on asylum applications\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fbecause \"[d]ue process rights do not accrue to discretionary forms\n\nof relief, and asylum is a discretionary form of relief\").\n\n            Drawing on these precedents, we now join our sister\n\ncircuits in holding that the judicial review bar of § 1158(a)(3)\n\ndoes not represent a due process violation.              Accordingly, we have\n\nno jurisdiction to review the BIA's rejection of Hana's application\n\nfor asylum on timeliness grounds.\n\n                                       III.\n\n            Hana also claims that he is entitled to withholding of\n\nremoval under § 241(b)(3)(A) of the INA or relief under the CAT.\n\nTo qualify for withholding of removal or CAT relief, Hana must\n\ndemonstrate that he is “more likely than not” to face persecution\n\nor torture, respectively, upon return to Egypt.                       8 C.F.R. §\n\n1208.16(b), (c); Awad v. Gonzales, 463 F.3d 73, 76-77 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); Guzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir. 2003).                Both the IJ\n\nand the BIA determined that Hana has not made such a showing.                   We\n\nreview     the    BIA's      factual   findings       under   the     deferential\n\n“substantial evidence” standard.              Guzman, 327 F.3d at 15.         This\n\nmeans    that    we   must   affirm    the    BIA's   findings   if    they   were\n\n“supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.”            Dine v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 89,\n\n92 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992)).\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fA. Withholding of Removal\n\n            An applicant seeking withholding of removal under INA §\n\n241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A), see supra note 2, bears the\n\nburden of demonstrating that “his or her life or freedom would be\n\nthreatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race,\n\nreligion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or\n\npolitical opinion.”          8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b).           The applicant must\n\n“establish     a     clear     probability       of    persecution      to   avoid\n\ndeportation.”       INS v. Stevic, 467 U.S. 407, 413 (1984); see also\n\nPan, 489 F.3d at 86 (noting that the \"more likely than not\"\n\nstandard      requires       greater      evidence     than    the     \"reasonable\n\npossibility\" standard applied in asylum cases).\n\n            The BIA correctly concluded that Hana has not met this\n\nstandard.     We have previously stated that mere harassment does not\n\nrise to the level of persecution, Susanto v. Gonzales, 439 F.3d 57,\n\n59-60 (1st Cir. 2006), and that a finding of persecution requires\n\nmore   than    unpleasantness       or     unfair     treatment,     Nikijuluw   v.\n\nGonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120-21 (1st Cir. 2005).                    Here, Hana has\n\nidentified only two incidents in which he suffered any physical\n\nharm at all, and in one of those incidents (the car accident),\n\nthere was no evidence that his religion was known by the people who\n\nharmed him.        Thus, Hana was harmed by someone who knew of his\n\nreligion only once, suffered very minor injuries, and has no\n\nevidence    suggesting       that   the    violence    he   suffered    there    was\n\n                                          -10-\n\forganized,      planned,   or   otherwise      part   of    a   larger    pattern\n\ncharacterized by government involvement or acquiescence.                  See id.\n\n(\"[P]ersecution     'always     implies    some   connection      to   government\n\naction or inaction.'\" (quoting Harutyunyan v. Gonzales, 421 F.3d\n\n64, 68 (1st Cir. 2005))).        Hana has not demonstrated that he would\n\nmore likely than not suffer persecution if he returned to Egypt.\n\nWe affirm the BIA's rejection of Hana’s request for withholding of\n\nremoval.\n\nB.   Relief Under the CAT\n\n              An applicant claiming protection under the CAT bears the\n\nburden of establishing that “it is more likely than not that he or\n\nshe would be tortured if removed to the proposed country.”                       8\n\nC.F.R.    §   1208.16(c)(2);     see,    e.g.,    Guzman,   327    F.3d   at   16.\n\nAlthough there need not be any connection between the likely\n\ntorture and the alien's religion (or race, or political opinions,\n\netc.), the alien must provide some specific evidence that he will\n\nlikely suffer \"severe physical or mental pain or suffering\" that is\n\n\"intentionally inflicted,\" \"by or at the instigation of or with the\n\nconsent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or\n\nphysical control\" of him.        Romilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 8 (1st\n\nCir. 2004) (quoting Elien v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir.\n\n2004)).\n\n              Hana has presented no evidence that he has experienced\n\nany torture while in Egypt, nor that there is any likelihood of\n\n                                        -11-\n\ftorture upon his return.    The IJ noted that Hana had no evidence\n\nthat his family members, including his mother and two sisters, who\n\nare members of the same faith, have been subjected to torture, or\n\neven lesser violence.      On this record, the BIA's rejection of\n\nrelief under the CAT is supported by substantial evidence and we\n\naffirm.\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we deny the petition for\n\nreview.\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\f",

Over the next two years, Hana was twice approached by other men who tried to convince him to abandon his church duties by offering him a higher-paying position or by threatening him. In November of 2000, after having spent the day delivering pamphlets to churches, Hana was run off the road by two bearded men driving a black micro-bus; Hana was unable to give the police any information about the men or their vehicle. The following month, Hana was involved in a more serious accident, when two men who had been following his car for an hour suddenly pulled in front of him and stopped short, forcing Hana's car into the back of their vehicle and Hana's head through his windshield. Hana did not offer any evidence suggesting that this accident was related to any of the prior incidents or that it was related to his religious beliefs.</p>\n<p>Soon after this second accident, Hana sought treatment from a psychiatrist, who diagnosed him as suffering from a persistent case of depression due to external stress factors in his environment. The psychiatrist prescribed medication, and suggested that Hana change his environment. Hana had obtained a visa prior to the accident and took the first of two trips to the United States, arriving on January 3, 2001 and returning to Egypt approximately six months later, without attempting to seek asylum.</p>\n<p>Within two weeks of returning to Egypt, Hana received an anonymous phone call in which the caller told him, \"Welcome home. We are waiting for you; we won't forget you.\" This phone call apparently caused Hana to suffer a nervous breakdown. During this period, Hana was visited at home several times by his priest; on one occasion, the priest's car was vandalized, with the words \"Mohammad is the messenger of Allah\" scratched on the side.</p>\n<p>Frightened by what he viewed as acts of persecution, Hana left Egypt for the United States on December 19, 2001 and was admitted on a six-month, non-immigrant visa. After he recovered from this period of extreme mental stress, Hana, who had by then overstayed his visa, hired a lawyer. Almost sixteen months after entering the country, he filed an Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal. At a hearing before an IJ, Hana conceded removability but, in addition to asylum, sought withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\")<sup>[2]</sup> and the Convention <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> Against Torture (\"CAT\"). The IJ issued an oral decision denying Hana's asylum claim because it was not filed within the one-year deadline, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), and Hana had not demonstrated \"extraordinary circumstances\" that would excuse the tardy filing, <i>see id.</i> § 1158(a)(2)(D). The IJ also rejected Hana's claims for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT, but granted Hana voluntary departure to leave the country before May 3, 2005. Hana filed a timely appeal to the BIA. The BIA dismissed his appeal, stating that \"no clear error has been demonstrated with respect to any factual finding\" made by the IJ, and reinstated the voluntary departure period. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Hana raises two claims on appeal, the first of which concerns his request for asylum. Both the IJ and the BIA have determined that his asylum application was untimely. To be eligible for asylum, an applicant must show by clear and convincing evidence that he filed his application within one year of arriving in the United States. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B). Alternatively, the applicant may overcome this limitation by demonstrating the existence of \"extraordinary circumstances\" sufficient to merit an exemption from the one-year deadline. <i>Id.</i> § 1158(a)(2)(D); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5) (stating that failure to satisfy the one-year deadline may be excused if the alien identifies \"extraordinary circumstances,\" directly related to the delayed filing, and if the alien \"filed the application within a reasonable period given those circumstances\").</p>\n<p>A. Timeliness of Asylum Application</p>\n<p>Hana first asks us to reverse the BIA's decision to reject his application on timeliness grounds. Although he concedes that his asylum application was untimely, he argues that he presented \"extraordinary circumstances\" that excuse the delay, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D). Specifically, Hana claims that upon his arrival in the United States, he suffered \"extreme mental distress\" (including depression and a nervous breakdown) as a result of the physical harm and threats made against him in Egypt, and that his mental condition constituted extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p>We do not have jurisdiction to review the agency's findings regarding timeliness or its application of the \"extraordinary circumstances\" exception, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3), unless an alien identifies a legal or constitutional defect in the decision. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D) (stating that no provision of the INA \"which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law\" raised before the appropriate court of appeals); <i>see also </i><i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> 489 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir.2007)(finding no jurisdiction over the BIA's determinations that an asylum application was untimely and there were no extraordinary circumstances excusing the delay); <i>Sharari v. Gonzales,</i> 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st Cir.2005) (noting that the statute's jurisdictional bar applies both to the BIA's determination that the petition was untimely and to its decision that no exception applies).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> Both the IJ and the BIA have determined that there are no extraordinary circumstances justifying Hana's delayed application for asylum. We have no jurisdiction to review the rejection of Hana's asylum application on this ground.</p>\n<p>B. Due Process and Removal of Jurisdiction</p>\n<p>Hana also argues that Congress has violated his right to due process by precluding our review over asylum timeliness decisions (including \"extraordinary circumstances\" decisions) under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3).<sup>[3]</sup> The Supreme Court has recognized Congress's plenary power over matters of immigration and naturalization. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Reno v. Flores,</i> 507 U.S. 292, 305, 113 S.Ct. 1439, 123 L.Ed.2d 1 (1993) (\"`[O]ver no conceivable subject is the legislative power of Congress more complete. . . .'\" (quoting <i>Oceanic Steam Navig. Co. v. Stranahan,</i> 214 U.S. 320, 339, 29 S.Ct. 671, 53 L.Ed. 1013 (1909))). Such plenary power has traditionally included Congress's power to remove judicial jurisdiction over executive decisions involving aliens. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Carlson v. Landon,</i> 342 U.S. 524, 537, 72 S.Ct. 525, 96 L.Ed. 547 (1952) (\"The power to expel aliens, being essentially a power of the political branches of government, the legislative and executive, may be exercised entirely through executive officers, `with such opportunity for judicial review of their action as congress may see fit to authorize or permit.'\"). \"Deportation,\" according to the Supreme Court, \"is not a criminal proceeding and has never been held to be punishment . . . [, and thus] [n]o judicial review is guaranteed by the Constitution.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Relying on the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Carlson,</i> both the Third and Ninth Circuits have explicitly rejected the argument that the jurisdictional bar of 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3) represents a due process violation. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sukwanputra v. Gonzales,</i> 434 F.3d 627, 632-33 (3d Cir.2006) (\"Because judicial review is not constitutionally guaranteed, the judicial review bar of § 1158(a)(3) does not violate the Due Process Clause.\"); <i>Hakeem v. INS,</i> 273 F.3d 812, 815-16 (9th Cir.2001) (holding that the removal of jurisdiction over timeliness decisions does not violate the Due Process Clause).</p>\n<p>While we have not previously addressed the question whether the jurisdictional bar of 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3) represents a due process violation, we have held that removal of judicial review in the immigration context does not raise constitutional issues when <i>some</i> avenue for judicial relief remains available to address core legal and constitutional concerns. <i>See </i><i>Kolster v. INS,</i> 101 F.3d 785, 791 (1st Cir.1996). We have also held that the one-year deadline for submission of asylum applications does not violate aliens' due process rights. <i>Ticoalu v. Gonzales,</i> 472 F.3d 8, 11 (1st Cir.2006) (rejecting a due process challenge to the enforcement of the one-year limitation on asylum applications because \"[d]ue process rights do not accrue to discretionary forms of relief, and asylum is a discretionary form of relief\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> Drawing on these precedents, we now join our sister circuits in holding that the judicial review bar of § 1158(a)(3) does not represent a due process violation. Accordingly, we have no jurisdiction to review the BIA's rejection of Hana's application for asylum on timeliness grounds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Hana also claims that he is entitled to withholding of removal under § 241(b)(3)(A) of the INA or relief under the CAT. To qualify for withholding of removal or CAT relief, Hana must demonstrate that he is \"more likely than not\" to face persecution or torture, respectively, upon return to Egypt. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b), (c); <i>Awad v. Gonzales,</i> 463 F.3d 73, 76-77 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Guzman v. INS,</i> 327 F.3d 11, 16 (1st Cir.2003). Both the IJ and the BIA determined that Hana has not made such a showing. We review the BIA's factual findings under the deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard. <i>Guzman,</i> 327 F.3d at 15. This means that we must affirm the BIA's findings if they were \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>Dine v. Gonzales,</i> 464 F.3d 89, 92 (1st Cir.2006) (citing <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992)).</p>\n<p>A. Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p>An applicant seeking withholding of removal under INA § 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A), <i>see supra</i> note 2, bears the burden of demonstrating that \"his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b). The applicant must \"establish a clear probability of persecution to avoid deportation.\" <i>INS v. Stevic,</i> 467 U.S. 407, 413, 104 S.Ct. 2489, 81 L.Ed.2d 321 (1984); <i>see also </i><i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 86 (noting that the \"more likely than not\" standard requires greater evidence than the \"reasonable possibility\" standard applied in asylum cases).</p>\n<p>The BIA correctly concluded that Hana has not met this standard. We have previously stated that mere harassment does not rise to the level of persecution, <i>Susanto v. Gonzales,</i> 439 F.3d 57, 59-60 (1st Cir.2006), and that a finding of persecution requires more than unpleasantness or unfair treatment, <i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 115, 120-21 (1st Cir.2005). Here, Hana has identified only two incidents in which he suffered any physical harm at all, and in one of those incidents (the car accident), there was no evidence that his religion was known by the people who harmed him. Thus, Hana was harmed by someone who knew of his religion only once, suffered very minor injuries, and has no evidence suggesting that the violence he suffered there was organized, planned, or otherwise part of a larger pattern characterized by government involvement or acquiescence. <i>See id.</i> (\"[P]ersecution `always implies some connection to government action or inaction.'\" (quoting <i>Harutyunyan v. Gonzales,</i> 421 F.3d 64, 68 (1st Cir.2005))). Hana has not demonstrated that he would more likely than not suffer persecution if he returned to Egypt. We affirm the BIA's rejection of Hana's request for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p>B. Relief Under the CAT</p>\n<p>An applicant claiming protection under the CAT bears the burden of establishing that \"it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2); <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Guzman,</i> 327 F.3d at 16. Although there need not be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> any connection between the likely torture and the alien's religion (or race, or political opinions, etc.), the alien must provide some specific evidence that he will likely suffer \"severe physical or mental pain or suffering\" that is \"intentionally inflicted,\" \"by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical control\" of him. <i>Romilus v. Ashcroft,</i> 385 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting <i>Elien v. Ashcroft,</i> 364 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p>Hana has presented no evidence that he has experienced any torture while in Egypt, nor that there is any likelihood of torture upon his return. The IJ noted that Hana had no evidence that his family members, including his mother and two sisters, who are members of the same faith, have been subjected to torture, or even lesser violence. On this record, the BIA's rejection of relief under the CAT is supported by substantial evidence and we affirm.</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we <i>deny</i> the petition for review.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  We note that there are several discrepancies between Hana's written declaration in his initial application for asylum and his testimony at the removal hearing. In her decision, the IJ discussed one such discrepancy (regarding whether an assault on January 7, 2000 comprised one or two incidents), but added that \"[o]ther than [that] discrepancy, the respondent's testimony was consistent with that in his written statement.\" We recount the facts as Hana described them in his oral testimony, except where otherwise noted.</p>\n<p>[2]  Section 241(b)(3) provides for withholding of removal if the \"Attorney General decides that the alien's life or freedom would be threatened in [the destination country] because of the alien's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A). The alien bears the burden of proof and must show either that she has suffered past persecution, which creates a rebuttable presumption of future persecution, or that \"it is more likely than not that he or she would be persecuted\" on account of one of the five enumerated grounds if she were removed. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b).</p>\n<p>[3]  Hana separately contends that the IJ and BIA violated his right to due process by failing to provide him with a \"fair and efficient\" procedure for considering his claims. This argument spans only two sentences; the sole authority Hana cites merely indicates that the IJ and the BIA should consider the \"extraordinary circumstances\" question on an individualized basis. Hana has not identified any specific way in which his hearing was inadequate or unfair. Because this claim is perfunctory and unaccompanied by developed argumentation, we deem it waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n\n</div>",

We affirm the BIA's decision.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Hana, a Coptic Christian, claims that he faced persecution in Egypt on account of his religion.<sup>[1]</sup> In 2000, Hana, who volunteered as a driver for his church's religious school, was assaulted by two bearded men while he was waiting for two of his passengers. He believes that he was targeted for his religious views.

In November of 2000, after having spent the day delivering pamphlets to churches, Hana was run off the road by two bearded men driving a black micro-bus; Hana was unable to give the police any information about the men or their vehicle. The following month, Hana was involved in a more serious accident, when two men who had been following his car for an hour suddenly pulled in front of him and stopped short, forcing Hana's car into the back of their vehicle and Hana's head through his windshield.

The psychiatrist prescribed medication, and suggested that Hana change his environment. Hana had obtained a visa prior to the accident and took the first of two trips to the United States, arriving on January 3, 2001 and returning to Egypt approximately six months later, without attempting to seek asylum.</p>\n<p>Within two weeks of returning to Egypt, Hana received an anonymous phone call in which the caller told him, \"Welcome home.

After he recovered from this period of extreme mental stress, Hana, who had by then overstayed his visa, hired a lawyer. Almost sixteen months after entering the country, he filed an Application for Asylum and for Withholding of Removal. At a hearing before an IJ, Hana conceded removability but, in addition to asylum, sought withholding of removal under section 241(b)(3) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\")<sup>[2]</sup> and the Convention <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> Against Torture (\"CAT\"). The IJ issued an oral decision denying Hana's asylum claim because it was not filed within the one-year deadline, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), and Hana had not demonstrated \"extraordinary circumstances\" that would excuse the tardy filing, <i>see id.</i> § 1158(a)(2)(D). The IJ also rejected Hana's claims for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT, but granted Hana voluntary departure to leave the country before May 3, 2005. Hana filed a timely appeal to the BIA. The BIA dismissed his appeal, stating that \"no clear error has been demonstrated with respect to any factual finding\" made by the IJ, and reinstated the voluntary departure period. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Hana raises two claims on appeal, the first of which concerns his request for asylum. Both the IJ and the BIA have determined that his asylum application was untimely. To be eligible for asylum, an applicant must show by clear and convincing evidence that he filed his application within one year of arriving in the United States. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B). Alternatively, the applicant may overcome this limitation by demonstrating the existence of \"extraordinary circumstances\" sufficient to merit an exemption from the one-year deadline. <i>Id.</i> § 1158(a)(2)(D); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a)(5) (stating that failure to satisfy the one-year deadline may be excused if the alien identifies \"extraordinary circumstances,\" directly related to the delayed filing, and if the alien \"filed the application within a reasonable period given those circumstances\").</p>\n<p>A. Timeliness of Asylum Application</p>\n<p>Hana first asks us to reverse the BIA's decision to reject his application on timeliness grounds. Although he concedes that his asylum application was untimely, he argues that he presented \"extraordinary circumstances\" that excuse the delay, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(D). Specifically, Hana claims that upon his arrival in the United States, he suffered \"extreme mental distress\" (including depression and a nervous breakdown) as a result of the physical harm and threats made against him in Egypt, and that his mental condition constituted extraordinary circumstances.</p>\n<p>We do not have jurisdiction to review the agency's findings regarding timeliness or its application of the \"extraordinary circumstances\" exception, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3), unless an alien identifies a legal or constitutional defect in the decision. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(D) (stating that no provision of the INA \"which limits or eliminates judicial review, shall be construed as precluding review of constitutional claims or questions of law\" raised before the appropriate court of appeals); <i>see also </i><i>Pan v.

We have no jurisdiction to review the rejection of Hana's asylum application on this ground.</p>\n<p>B. Due Process and Removal of Jurisdiction</p>\n<p>Hana also argues that Congress has violated his right to due process by precluding our review over asylum timeliness decisions (including \"extraordinary circumstances\" decisions) under 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3).<sup>[3]</sup> The Supreme Court has recognized Congress's plenary power over matters of immigration and naturalization. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Reno v.

Accordingly, we have no jurisdiction to review the BIA's rejection of Hana's application for asylum on timeliness grounds.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Hana also claims that he is entitled to withholding of removal under § 241(b)(3)(A) of the INA or relief under the CAT. To qualify for withholding of removal or CAT relief, Hana must demonstrate that he is \"more likely than not\" to face persecution or torture, respectively, upon return to Egypt. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b), (c); <i>Awad v.

Both the IJ and the BIA determined that Hana has not made such a showing. We review the BIA's factual findings under the deferential \"substantial evidence\" standard. <i>Guzman,</i> 327 F.3d at 15. This means that we must affirm the BIA's findings if they were \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\" <i>Dine v.

Withholding of Removal</p>\n<p>An applicant seeking withholding of removal under INA § 241(b)(3)(A), 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A), <i>see supra</i> note 2, bears the burden of demonstrating that \"his or her life or freedom would be threatened in the proposed country of removal on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b). The applicant must \"establish a clear probability of persecution to avoid deportation.\" <i>INS v. Stevic,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111203\"><a href=\"/opinion/111203/ins-v-stevic/\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">407</span></a></span>, 413, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111203\"><a href=\"/opinion/111203/ins-v-stevic/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We have previously stated that mere harassment does not rise to the level of persecution, <i>Susanto v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202090\"><a href=\"/opinion/202090/susanto-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 59-60 (1st Cir.2006), and that a finding of persecution requires more than unpleasantness or unfair treatment, <i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201886\"><a href=\"/opinion/201886/nikijuluw-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 120-21 (1st Cir.2005). Here, Hana has identified only two incidents in which he suffered any physical harm at all, and in one of those incidents (the car accident), there was no evidence that his religion was known by the people who harmed him. Thus, Hana was harmed by someone who knew of his religion only once, suffered very minor injuries, and has no evidence suggesting that the violence he suffered there was organized, planned, or otherwise part of a larger pattern characterized by government involvement or acquiescence. <i>See id.</i> (\"[P]ersecution `always implies some connection to government action or inaction.'\" (quoting <i>Harutyunyan v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201799\"><a href=\"/opinion/201799/harutyunyan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span>, 68 (1st Cir.2005))). Hana has not demonstrated that he would more likely than not suffer persecution if he returned to Egypt. We affirm the BIA's rejection of Hana's request for withholding of removal.</p>\n<p>B. Relief Under the CAT</p>\n<p>An applicant claiming protection under the CAT bears the burden of establishing that \"it is more likely than not that he or she would be tortured if removed to the proposed country.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2); <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Guzman,</i> 327 F.3d at 16. Although there need not be <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> any connection between the likely torture and the alien's religion (or race, or political opinions, etc.), the alien must provide some specific evidence that he will likely suffer \"severe physical or mental pain or suffering\" that is \"intentionally inflicted,\" \"by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical control\" of him. <i>Romilus v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201241\"><a href=\"/opinion/201241/romilus-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting <i>Elien v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200971\"><a href=\"/opinion/200971/elien-v-john-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span>, 398 (1st Cir.2004)).</p>\n<p>Hana has presented no evidence that he has experienced any torture while in Egypt, nor that there is any likelihood of torture upon his return. The IJ noted that Hana had no evidence that his family members, including his mother and two sisters, who are members of the same faith, have been subjected to torture, or even lesser violence. On this record, the BIA's rejection of relief under the CAT is supported by substantial evidence and we affirm.</p>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we <i>deny</i> the petition for review.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  We note that there are several discrepancies between Hana's written declaration in his initial application for asylum and his testimony at the removal hearing. In her decision, the IJ discussed one such discrepancy (regarding whether an assault on January 7, 2000 comprised one or two incidents), but added that \"[o]ther than [that] discrepancy, the respondent's testimony was consistent with that in his written statement.\" We recount the facts as Hana described them in his oral testimony, except where otherwise noted.</p>\n<p>[2]  Section 241(b)(3) provides for withholding of removal if the \"Attorney General decides that the alien's life or freedom would be threatened in [the destination country] because of the alien's race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A). The alien bears the burden of proof and must show either that she has suffered past persecution, which creates a rebuttable presumption of future persecution, or that \"it is more likely than not that he or she would be persecuted\" on account of one of the five enumerated grounds if she were removed. 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(b).</p>\n<p>[3]  Hana separately contends that the IJ and BIA violated his right to due process by failing to provide him with a \"fair and efficient\" procedure for considering his claims. This argument spans only two sentences; the sole authority Hana cites merely indicates that the IJ and the BIA should consider the \"extraordinary circumstances\" question on an individualized basis. Hana has not identified any specific way in which his hearing was inadequate or unfair. Because this claim is perfunctory and unaccompanied by developed argumentation, we deem it waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n\n</div>",
