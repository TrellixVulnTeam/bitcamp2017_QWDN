ASPEN,\n\n                     Petitioner, Appellant,\n\n                               v.\n\n                    LYNN BISSONNETTE, ET AL.,\n\n                     Respondents, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n         [Hon. F. Dennis Saylor IV, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                      Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                   and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Daniel J. Johnedis was on brief for petitioner.\n     Randall E. Ravitz, Assistant Attorney General, Criminal\nBureau, with whom Thomas F. Reilly, Attorney General, was on brief\nfor respondents.\n\n\n\n                         March 21, 2007\n\f             HOWARD, Circuit Judge.       In 1998, Massachusetts state\n\nprisoner   Richard   Aspen   was   convicted   of   raping   and   sexually\n\nassaulting his stepdaughter.       During the selection of the petit\n\njury, Aspen claimed that the prosecutor exercised her peremptory\n\nchallenges to exclude potential male jurors in violation of the\n\nEqual Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, as interpreted\n\nin Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 85 (1986) (holding that the\n\nracially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges violates equal\n\nprotection), and J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127, 129 (1991)\n\n(extending Batson to the use of peremptory challenges on the basis\n\nof gender).     The trial judge denied Aspen's challenge, concluding\n\nthat he had not established a prima facie case of discrimination.\n\n             Aspen appealed to the Massachusetts Appeals Court.         The\n\ncourt considered Aspen's equal protection claim under Article 12 of\n\nthe Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, which\n\nit understood to mandate the same analysis as the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment.    Commonwealth v. Aspen, 758 N.E.2d 163, 166 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 2001).    The court stated that to establish a prima facie case,\n\nAspen had to show \"that there [was] a pattern of excluding members\"\n\nof the venire on account of gender, and \"it [was] likely that\n\nindividuals [were] being excluded solely\" on the basis of gender.\n\nId.   The court also explained that, once presented with this\n\nevidence, the trial judge had to determine \"whether to draw the\n\nreasonable inference that peremptory challenges have been exercised\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fso as to exclude individuals on account of\" gender.              Id.     After\n\nstating the standard, the court concluded that Aspen had not\n\nestablished a prima facie case because the trial \"judge could\n\nproperly conclude that . . . gender was not shown to be the likely\n\nreason for the [prosecutor's] initial challenges.\"             Id. at 168.\n\n           Aspen's request for further appellate review by the\n\nMassachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) was denied.                 Having\n\nexhausted state court remedies, Aspen filed a petition for a writ\n\nof habeas corpus in federal district court, arguing that the\n\nAppeals    Court   had   applied   an     incorrect   legal    standard      in\n\nconsidering his Batson claim. He asserted that the state court had\n\nerred by requiring him, in order to make out a prima facie case, to\n\nestablish that it was \"likely\" that the prosecutor exercised\n\nperemptory challenges on account of gender.           The district court,\n\napplying    the    deferential     standards    of    review     under     the\n\nAntiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA),\n\nrejected Aspen's petition but did grant him a certificate of\n\nappealability, see 28 U.S.C ยง 2254(b)(1)(A).\n\n           We review the denial of Aspen's habeas petition de novo.\n\nSee Ellsworth v. Warden, 333 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2003) (en banc).\n\nWhere, as here, the state court considered Aspen's claim on the\n\nmerits, our review is governed by AEDPA.         See Lynch v. Ficco, 438\n\nF.3d 35, 44 (1st Cir. 2006).       Under AEDPA, we may not disturb the\n\nstate court's conclusion unless the \"adjudication of [Aspen's]\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fclaim resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"                  28 U.S.C.\n\nยง 2254(d)(1).\n\n               A state court adjudication is \"contrary to\" Supreme Court\n\nprecedent if, when made, it results from the application of a rule\n\nthat contradicts the governing law set forth by the Supreme Court\n\nor   is   inconsistent       with   a   Supreme   Court    decision    in   a   case\n\ninvolving      \"materially     indistinguishable\"         facts.      Williams    v.\n\nTaylor, 529 U.S. 362, 405-06 (2000).              A state court decision is an\n\nunreasonable application of the governing law if the state court\n\nidentifies the correct governing legal principle from the Supreme\n\nCourt's    then-current       decisions     but   unreasonably     applies      that\n\nprinciple to the facts of the prisoner's case.                     See Horton v.\n\nAllen, 370 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n               The clearly established law governing the discriminatory\n\nuse of peremptory challenges was set forth in Batson.                   The Court\n\ndescribed a three-part test for adjudicating claims that peremptory\n\nchallenges have been exercised in a discriminatory manner.                       The\n\nmoving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating a prima\n\nfacie case of discrimination.             Batson, 476 U.S. at 96.           If this\n\nburden    is    met,   the   non-moving     party   must    then   offer    a   non-\n\ndiscriminatory reason for striking the potential juror. Id. at 97.\n\nFinally, the trial court must determine if the moving party has met\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fits ultimate burden of persuasion that the peremptory challenge was\n\nexercised for a discriminatory reason.                   Id. at 98.\n\n            Batson also described the moving party's burden at the\n\nprima facie stage.          To establish a prima facie case, the moving\n\nparty must \"raise an inference that the prosecutor used [peremptory\n\nchallenges] to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury\" because\n\nof their membership in a protected class.                      Id. at 96.   The judge\n\nmay   consider       all     \"relevant       circumstances\"        in    making     this\n\ndetermination.       Id.\n\n            Most      significantly          for     present      purposes,       Batson\n\nestablished that the moving party's burden in meeting the prima\n\nfacie requirement is not substantial. The Batson opinion relied on\n\nthe   Court's    earlier      Title    VII        jurisprudence     to   define     \"the\n\noperation of [the] prima facie burden of proof rules.\" 476 U.S. at\n\n94 n.18.     Among the Title VII cases cited in Batson was Texas\n\nDepartment of Community Affairs v. Burdine, 450 U.S. 248, 253\n\n(1981), in which           the Court held that the plaintiff's burden in\n\nestablishing     a    prima    facie     case      of    discrimination      was    \"not\n\nonerous.\"    Our post-Batson precedents reflect the understanding\n\nthat the burden is not substantial.                See United States v. Escobar-\n\nde Jesus, 187 F.3d 148, 164 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v.\n\nBergodere,      40   F.3d     512,    516    (1st       Cir.   1994).1      Even    more\n\n\n      1\n      Decisions from the lower federal courts may help inform the\nAEDPA analysis to the extent that they state the clearly\nestablished federal law determined by the Supreme Court. See Ouber\n\n                                            -5-\n\fimportantly, the Supreme Court has recently reiterated that the\n\nBatson prima facie standard is not onerous.         See Johnson v.\n\nCalifornia, 545 U.S. 162, 170 (2005).2\n\n           In Johnson, the Supreme Court considered whether it was\n\nconsistent with Batson to require the moving party to show, at the\n\nprima facie stage, that it was \"more likely than not\" that a\n\nperemptory challenge had been exercised on a prohibited ground.\n\nId. at 164.    The Court held that such a \"standard [was] at odds\n\nwith the prima facie inquiry mandated by Batson.\"    Id. at 173.    In\n\nreaching this conclusion, the Court relied exclusively on Batson as\n\nprecedent.     It explained that the Batson first step was not\n\nintended \"to be so onerous that a defendant would have to persuade\n\nthe judge . . . that the challenge was more likely than not the\n\nproduct   of   purposeful   discrimination.   Instead,   a   defendant\n\nsatisfies the requirements of Batson's first step by producing\n\n\n\nv. Guarino, 293 F.3d 19, 27 (1st Cir. 2002).\n     2\n      Supreme Court opinions issued after the state court decision\nin question are relevant to the AEDPA analysis to the extent that\nthey restate the clearly established law from earlier Supreme Court\nopinions. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 522 (2003); see also\nFrazer v. South Carolina, 430 F.3d 696, 715 (4th Cir. 2005) (Motz,\nJ., concurring) (\"Where . . . a Supreme Court decision . . . simply\nillustrates the appropriate application of a Supreme Court\nprecedent that pre-dates the state-court determination . . . a\nfederal court on habeas may consider the postdated opinion.\");\nTruesdale v. Sabourin, 427 F. Supp. 2d 451, 459 (S.D.N.Y. 2006)\n(considering   Johnson on habeas review, even though it was not\ndecided when state court decision was rendered, because it\n\"summariz[ed] and confirm[ed] the enduring vitality of law that was\nclearly established\" in Batson).\n\n                                  -6-\n\fevidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference\n\nthat discrimination has occurred.\"            Id. at 170.\n\n           In holding that Aspen had not carried his burden because\n\nhe had not shown that it \"was likely\" that the prosecutor had\n\nexercised peremptory challenges on the basis of gender, the Appeals\n\nCourt judged Aspen's prima facie burden by a more rigid standard\n\nthan that established by Batson.           Batson clearly established that\n\nAspen was only required to make a \"likelihood\" showing at the final\n\nstage of the burden-shifting framework.              476 U.S. at 94 n.18; see\n\nalso Purkett v. Elem,         514 U.S. 765, 768 (1995) (per curiam) (\"It\n\nis not until the third step [of Batson] that the persuasiveness of\n\nthe justification becomes relevant -- the step in which the trial\n\ncourt determines whether the opponent of the strike has carried his\n\nburden   of   proving    purposeful     discrimination.\")           (emphasis   in\n\noriginal).\n\n           The Commonwealth argues that the Appeals Court applied\n\nthe appropriate standard because the opinion stated that when\n\n\"[c]onfronted with a claim that a peremptory challenge is being\n\nused to exclude members of a discrete group, the judge must\n\ndetermine whether to draw the reasonable inference that peremptory\n\nchallenges    have    been     exercised      on    account   of    their   group\n\naffiliation.\"        Aspen,    758   N.E.2d    at    166.     The    Commonwealth\n\ncorrectly states that an \"inference\" of discrimination is the\n\nBatson prima facie case standard.              But it is apparent that the\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fAppeals Court equated an \"inference\" of discrimination with a\n\nshowing that gender was the \"likely\" reason that the prosecutor\n\nexercised her peremptory challenges.3     As explained above, Batson\n\nestablishes that the \"inference of discrimination\" standard is not\n\nso demanding.4   See Wade v. Terhune, 202 F.3d 1190, 1196 (9th Cir.\n\n2000) (concluding that state appellate court misapplied Batson\n\nwhere it understood the \"inference\" standard to require the moving\n\nparty to show a \"strong likelihood\" that peremptory challenges were\n\nbeing exercised on an improper basis).\n\n           That the Appeals Court applied a standard that was\n\ncontrary to clearly established federal law does not automatically\n\nentitle the petitioner to relief, however. A writ of habeas corpus\n\nwill issue only upon a showing that the petitioner \"is in custody\n\nin violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United\n\nStates.\"   28 U.S.C. ยง 2254.   This means that a petitioner must show\n\nthat his underlying detention is unlawful and not just that the\n\n\n     3\n      Something is \"likely\" to occur \"if it has a better chance of\noccurring than not.\" Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary 1310\n(1993). This standard closely parallels the standard repudiated in\nJohnson.\n     4\n      Aspen suggests that Massachusetts law under Article 12 is\ngenerally at odds with Batson.     We do not decide this question\nbecause our focus is only on the state court decision in this case.\nWe note, however, that the SJC has stated that the prima facie\nburden under Article 12 is \"not . . . a terribly weighty one,\"\nCommonwealth v. Maldonado, 788 N.E.2d 968, 971 n.4 (Mass. 2003),\nand that the SJC has found a prima facie case established under\nArticle 12 on evidence that would not seem to make it \"likely\" that\ndiscrimination occurred in the use of a peremptory challenge,\nCommonwealth v. Harris, 567 N.E.2d 899, 902-03 (Mass. 1991).\n\n                                  -8-\n\fstate court employed faulty reasoning in his case.         See Bronshtein\n\nv. Horn, 404 F.3d 700, 724 (3d Cir. 2005).         As we have explained,\n\nhabeas relief is available only if the petitioner demonstrates that\n\n\"Supreme Court precedent requires an outcome contrary to that\n\nreached by the relevant state court.\"         O'Brien v. Dubois, 145 F.3d\n\n16, 24-25 (1st Cir. 1998) (emphasis added), abrogated on other\n\ngrounds, McCambridge v. Hall, 303 F.3d 24 (1st Cir. 2002) (en\n\nbanc).   Accordingly,   Aspen   may     not   obtain   habeas   relief   if,\n\napplying the correct Batson standard, he would still not prevail on\n\nhis claim.\n\n          We consider de novo whether Aspen is entitled to relief\n\nunder the correct Batson standard. See Bronshtein, 404 F.3d at 724\n\n(considering de novo whether habeas petitioner established prima\n\nfacie case under Batson where state appellate court had incorrectly\n\napplied Batson standard); Paulino v. Castro, 371 F.3d 1083, 1090\n\n(9th Cir. 2004) (similar).      In so doing, we limit our review to\n\nfacts gleaned from the state court record concerning jury selection\n\nat Aspen's trial. The trial court conducted a three-day voir dire.\n\nAfter potential jurors had been stricken for cause, the venire\n\nconsisted of twenty-eight men and sixteen women, and the first\n\npanel of prospective jurors included twelve men and four women,\n\nwith no distinction as to which four would be alternates.\n\n          Each side was allowed sixteen peremptory challenges.            In\n\nthe prosecutor's first round of peremptory challenges, she struck\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fsix men.   These six men were replaced by four men and two women.\n\nThe prosecutor struck one of the male replacements who was, in\n\nturn, replaced by another man.         She then stated that she was\n\ncontent with the jury.   At this point, the panel consisted of ten\n\nmen and six women.\n\n           The trial court then permitted Aspen to exercise his\n\nperemptory challenges.   He struck five women and two men.      These\n\nseven potential jurors were replaced by three men and four women.\n\nAspen then struck three more women.       Two men and one woman were\n\nseated as replacements, and Aspen challenged the woman.     A man was\n\nselected to replace the last stricken juror, and Aspen then stated\n\nthat he was satisfied.     At this point, the jury consisted of\n\nfourteen men and two women.\n\n           The prosecutor then struck five men.     Two men and three\n\nwomen were seated as replacements, and the prosecutor challenged\n\none of the men.      A woman replaced the stricken man and the\n\nprosecutor stated that she was satisfied.      The potential jury was\n\nthen ten men and six women.\n\n           Aspen exercised his second round of peremptory challenges\n\nby eliminating three of the women.     They were replaced by one woman\n\nand two men.   Aspen challenged one of the men, who was replaced by\n\nanother man.    Aspen announced that he was satisfied, and the\n\nprosecutor agreed, even though she had three challenges remaining.\n\n\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fAs   did    the    original   panel,   the    final    jury,    with   alternates,\n\nconsisted of twelve men and four women.5\n\n              In    total,    the   prosecutor        had    exercised    thirteen\n\nperemptory challenges, all of which were against prospective male\n\njurors.      Aspen had exercised fifteen challenges, twelve of which\n\nwere against prospective female jurors.                     He contends that the\n\nprosecutor's use of all of her challenges against men is sufficient\n\nevidence to establish a prima facie case under Batson and J.E.B.\n\n              We have cautioned that a party \"who advances a Batson\n\nargument ordinarily should come forward with facts, not just\n\nnumbers alone.\"         Bergedore, 40 F.3d at 516.6              Here, Aspen has\n\nrelied entirely on the number of prosecution strikes against men.\n\nIt is at least questionable whether this evidence is adequate to\n\nsurpass the prima facie hurdle. See United States v. Esparsen, 930\n\nF.2d 1461, 1467 (10th Cir. 1991) (\"By itself, the number of\n\nchallenges used against members of a particular [group] is not\n\nsufficient to establish . . . a prima facie case.\"); Sangineto-\n\nMiranda, 859 F.2d at 1521 (stating that evidence \"standing alone\"\n\nthat the government exercised all of its peremptory challenges\n\nagainst black members of the venire \"does not raise the necessary\n\n\n      5\n          Ultimately, nine men and three women deliberated.\n      6\n      Indeed, we have never held that a \"statistical disparity\nalone can demonstrate a prima facie case.\" Brewer v. Marshall, 119\nF.3d 993, 1005 (1st Cir. 1997). We have, however, left open the\npossibility of such a case.     Id. We continue to maintain that\nstance.\n\n                                       -11-\n\finference of purposeful discrimination\" to establish a prima facie\n\ncase).   But even assuming that Aspen could establish a prima facie\n\ncase, it is clear that he cannot ultimately establish a Batson\n\nviolation.\n\n             In considering Batson claims, courts examine both numeric\n\nand non-numeric forms of evidence.              Relevant numeric evidence\n\nincludes the percentage of strikes directed against members of a\n\nparticular group, e.g., Paulino, 371 F.3d at 1091, the percentage\n\nof a particular group removed from the venire by the challenged\n\nstrikes, e.g., Turner v. Marshall, 63 F.3d 807, 813 (9th Cir.\n\n1995), abrogated on other grounds, Tolbert v. Page, 182 F.3d 677,\n\n684 (9th Cir. 1995), and a comparison of the percentage of a\n\ngroup's representation in the venire to its representation on the\n\njury, e.g., United States v. Sangineto-Miranda, 859 F.2d 1501,\n\n1521-22 (6th Cir. 1988).       Relevant non-numeric evidence includes\n\nthe striking party's questions and statements during the voir dire,\n\ne.g., Brewer, 119 F.3d at 1004, whether the striking party had\n\nunused peremptory challenges through which he or she could have\n\neliminated more members of the allegedly targeted group, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Allison, 908 F.2d 1531, 1538 (11th Cir. 1990),\n\napparent non-discriminatory reasons for striking potential jurors\n\nbased on their voir dire answers, e.g., United States v. Stephens,\n\n421   F.3d   503,   515-16   (7th   Cir.    2005),   and   whether   similarly\n\nsituated jurors from outside the allegedly targeted group were\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fpermitted to serve, Boyd v. Newland, 467 F.3d 1139, 1148-50 (9th\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n          Looking first to the numeric evidence, the prosecutor's\n\nstrikes were all aimed at men.         But these challenges removed only\n\nforty-six percent of the males from the venire and even after the\n\nprosecutor's strikes (not all of which were used), men remained the\n\ndominant group.      This fact at least tends to mitigate an inference\n\nof discrimination.      See United States v. Brisk, 171 F.3d 514, 523\n\n(7th Cir. 1999) (holding no Batson violation established, in part,\n\nbecause even though two-thirds of strikes were directed against\n\nwomen, the strikes did not remove a significant percentage of the\n\nwomen in the venire).\n\n          More importantly, the strikes had little effect on the\n\ncomposition of the actual jury seated.        Indeed, the jury agreed to\n\nby the prosecutor was seventy-five percent male, even though the\n\noriginal venire, after the strikes for cause, was only sixty-three\n\npercent male.     See Escobar-de Jesus, 187 F.3d at 165 (no Batson\n\nviolation based on strikes of African-American jurors where six\n\nAfrican-Americans served on the jury); Sangineto-Miranda, 859 F.2d\n\nat 1522 (treating the fact that the \"percentage of minority members\n\n[on] the ultimate jury is the same or greater\" than in the venire\n\nas   tending    to    \"negate   the    inference   of   discrimination\").\n\nAdditionally, the final jury agreed to by the prosecutor had the\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fexact       gender   composition     as    the    original   panel   faced    by   the\n\nprosecutor.\n\n                  Aspen's emphasis on the raw number of strikes made\n\nagainst men loses force when this species of numeric evidence is\n\nconsidered in context. The context here was that Aspen struck most\n\nof the women members of the venire and that women constituted a\n\nminority of the venire from the outset.                   In fact, Aspen struck\n\nseventy-five percent of the prospective female jurors.                   The result\n\nwas that the panels of potential jurors faced by the prosecutor\n\nwere predominantly male.            Indeed, most of the time, the potential\n\njuror panel from which the prosecutor made her strikes was between\n\nsixty-nine percent and eighty-eight percent male.                    Therefore, the\n\nraw number of strikes against men is not particularly telling in\n\nthese circumstances because Aspen's use of peremptory challenges\n\nkept the number of men on the panel disproportionately high.7                      See\n\nUnited States v. Ochoa-Vasquez, 428 F.3d 1015, 1047 n.47 (11th Cir.\n\n2005) (stating that strikes made by the party raising a Batson\n\nclaim       are    relevant   to   the    extent   that   they   explain     how   the\n\ncomposition of the final jury was formed).\n\n\n\n        7\n      Aspen argues that his use of peremptory challenges is\nirrelevant because the fact that he may have struck jurors on\naccount of gender does not allow the prosecutor to do the same. We\nagree that the a party may not defend an improper use of\nperemptory challenges by arguing that the other party engaged in\nsimilar conduct. See Stephens, 421 F.3d at 514; Bui v. Haley, 321\nF.3d 1304, 1318 n.19 (11th Cir. 2003). But this is not the reason\nthat we discuss Aspen's use of peremptory challenges.\n\n                                           -14-\n\f          The non-numeric evidence further supports the conclusion\n\nthat a discriminatory motive did not infect the prosecutor's use of\n\nperemptory challenges.    There are no voir dire statements or\n\nquestions by the prosecutor that suggest a discriminatory motive.\n\nMoreover, seven of the jurors challenged by the prosecutor provided\n\nvoir dire answers that could reasonably have been understood to\n\nmean that the jurors may have been inclined to acquit the defendant\n\neven if he committed the conduct alleged.   In particular, certain\n\nmale jurors questioned whether it was legally possible for a person\n\nto rape a member of his own family, or whether a woman could, as a\n\nfactual matter, be raped without having provoked the attack.8\n\nFinally, the prosecutor could have challenged three more men from\n\nthe male-dominated panel finally selected but did not do so.     In\n\nthe circumstances at hand, this is an important indicum.        See\n\nBronshtein, 404 F.3d at 724 (finding relevant to Batson analysis\n\nthat the prosecutor \"passed up\" the opportunity to strike other\n\nprospective jurors who were members of the allegedly targeted\n\ngroup).\n\n          In sum, the Appeals Court misapplied Batson and J.E.B. in\n\nanalyzing Aspen's equal protection claim. But, even if the correct\n\nstandard had been applied, Aspen would not have benefitted because\n\nthe totality of the circumstances demonstrates that the prosecutor\n\n\n\n     8\n      No female juror accepted by the prosecutor made similar\ncomments.\n\n                               -15-\n\fdid   not   issue   peremptory   challenges   on   the   basis   of   gender.\n\nAccordingly, Aspen's habeas petition was correctly denied.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\f",

Kentucky,</i> 476 U.S. 79, 85, 106 S.Ct. 1712, 90 L.Ed.2d 69 (1986) (holding that the racially discriminatory use of peremptory challenges violates equal protection), and <i>J.E.B. v.

The court considered Aspen's equal protection claim under Article 12 of the Declaration of Rights of the Massachusetts Constitution, which it understood to mandate the same analysis as the Fourteenth Amendment. <i>Commonwealth v. Aspen,</i> 53 Mass.App.Ct. 259, 758 N.E.2d 163, 166 (2001). The court stated that to establish a prima facie case, Aspen had to show \"that there [was] a pattern of excluding members\" of the venire on account of gender, and \"it [was] likely that individuals [were] being excluded solely\" on the basis of gender. <i>Id.</i> The court also explained that, once presented with this evidence, the trial judge had to determine \"whether to draw the reasonable inference that peremptory challenges have been exercised so as to exclude individuals on account of\" gender. <i>Id.</i> After stating the standard, the court concluded that Aspen had not established a prima facie case because the trial \"judge could properly conclude that ... gender was not shown to be the likely reason for the [prosecutor's] initial challenges.\" <i>Id.</i> at 168.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aspen's request for further appellate review by the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court (SJC) was denied. Having exhausted state court remedies, Aspen filed a petition for a writ of habeas corpus in federal district court, arguing that the Appeals Court had applied an incorrect legal standard in considering his <i>Batson</i> claim. He asserted that the state court had erred by requiring him, in order to make out a prima facie case, to establish that it was \"likely\" that the prosecutor exercised peremptory challenges on account of gender. The district court, applying the deferential standards of review under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA), rejected Aspen's petition but did grant him a certificate of appealability, <i>see</i> 28 U.S.C &#167; 2254(b)(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of Aspen's habeas petition de novo. <i>See Ellsworth v.

Ficco,</i> 438 F.3d 35, 44 (1st Cir. 2006). Under AEDPA, we may not disturb the state court's conclusion unless the \"adjudication of [Aspen's] claim resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A state court adjudication is \"contrary to\" Supreme Court precedent if, when made, it results from the application of a rule that contradicts the governing law set forth by the Supreme Court or is inconsistent with a Supreme Court decision in a case involving \"materially indistinguishable\" facts. <i>Williams v.

A state court decision is an unreasonable application of the governing law if the state court identifies the correct governing legal principle from the Supreme Court's then-current decisions but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case. <i>See Horton v.

The moving party bears the initial burden of demonstrating a prima facie case of discrimination. <i>Batson,</i> 476 U.S. at 96, 106 S.Ct. 1712. If this burden is met, the non-moving party must then offer a non-discriminatory reason for striking the potential juror. <i>Id.</i> at 97, 106 S.Ct. 1712. Finally, the trial court must determine if the moving party has met its ultimate burden of persuasion that the peremptory challenge was exercised for a discriminatory reason. <i>Id.</i> at 98, 106 S.Ct. 1712.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Batson</i> also described the moving party's burden at the prima facie stage. To establish a prima facie case, the moving party must \"raise an inference that the prosecutor used [peremptory challenges] to exclude the veniremen from the petit jury\" because of their membership in a protected class. <i>Id.</i> at 96, 106 S.Ct. 1712. The judge may consider all \"relevant circumstances\" in making this determination. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Most significantly for present purposes, <i>Batson</i> established that the moving party's burden in meeting the prima facie requirement is not substantial. The <i>Batson</i> opinion relied on the Court's earlier Title VII jurisprudence to define \"the operation of [the] prima facie burden of proof rules.\" 476 U.S. at 94 n. 18, 106 S.Ct. 1712. Among the Title VII cases cited in <i>Batson</i> was <i>Texas Department of Community Affairs v. Burdine,</i> 450 U.S. 248, 253, 101 S.Ct. 1089, 67 L.Ed.2d 207 (1981), in which the Court held that the plaintiff's burden in establishing a prima facie case of discrimination was \"not onerous.\" Our post-<i>Batson</i> precedents reflect the understanding that the burden is not substantial. <i>See United States v. Escobarde Jesus,</i> 187 F.3d 148, 164 (1st Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Bergodere,</i> 40 F.3d 512, 516 (1st Cir.1994).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Even more importantly, the Supreme Court has recently reiterated that the <i>Batson</i> prima facie standard is not onerous. <i>See Johnson v. California,</i> 545 U.S. 162, 170, 125 S.Ct. 2410, 162 L.Ed.2d 129 (2005).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Johnson,</i> the Supreme Court considered whether it was consistent with <i>Batson</i> to require the moving party to show, at the prima facie stage, that it was \"more likely than not\" that a peremptory challenge had been exercised on a prohibited ground. <i>Id.</i> at 164, 125 S.Ct. 2410. The Court held that such a \"standard [was] at odds with the prima facie inquiry mandated by <i>Batson.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 173, 125 S.Ct. 2410. In reaching this conclusion, the Court relied exclusively on <i>Batson</i> as precedent. It explained that the <i>Batson</i> first step was not intended \"to be so onerous that a defendant would have to persuade the judge . . . that the challenge was more likely than not the product of purposeful discrimination. Instead, a defendant satisfies the requirements of <i>Batson's</i> first step by producing evidence sufficient to permit the trial judge to draw an inference that discrimination has occurred.\" <i>Id.</i> at 170, 125 S.Ct. 2410.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In holding that Aspen had not carried his burden because he had not shown that it \"was likely\" that the prosecutor had exercised peremptory challenges on the basis of gender, the Appeals Court judged Aspen's prima facie burden by a more rigid standard than that established by <i>Batson. Batson</i> clearly established that Aspen was only required to make a \"likelihood\" showing at the final stage of the burden-shifting framework. 476 U.S. at 94 n. 18, 106 S.Ct. 1712; <i>see also Purkett v. Elem,</i> 514 U.S. 765, 768, 115 S.Ct. 1769, 131 L.Ed.2d 834 (1995) (per curiam) (\"It is not until the <i>third</i> step [of <i>Batson</i>] that the persuasiveness of the justification becomes relevant &#8212; the step in which the trial court determines whether the opponent of the strike has carried his burden of proving purposeful discrimination.\") (emphasis in original).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth argues that the Appeals Court applied the appropriate standard because the opinion stated that when \"[c]onfronted with a claim that a peremptory challenge is being used to exclude members of a discrete group, the judge must determine whether to draw the reasonable inference that peremptory challenges have been exercised on account of their group affiliation.\" <i>Aspen,</i> 758 N.E.2d at 166. The Commonwealth correctly states that an \"inference\" of discrimination is the <i>Batson</i> prima facie case standard. But it is apparent that the Appeals Court equated an \"inference\" of discrimination with a showing that gender was the \"likely\" reason that the prosecutor exercised her peremptory challenges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> As explained above, <i>Batson</i> establishes that the \"inference of discrimination\" standard is not so demanding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Wade v. Terhune,</i> 202 F.3d 1190, 1196 (9th Cir.2000) (concluding that state appellate court misapplied <i>Batson</i> where it understood the \"inference\" standard to require the moving party to show a \"strong likelihood\" that peremptory challenges were being exercised on an improper basis).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That the Appeals Court applied a standard that was contrary to clearly established federal law does not automatically entitle the petitioner to relief, however. A writ of habeas corpus will issue only upon a showing that the petitioner \"is in custody in violation of the Constitution or laws or treaties of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254. This means that a petitioner must show that his underlying detention is unlawful and not just that the state court employed faulty reasoning in his case. <i>See Bronshtein v. Horn,</i> 404 F.3d 700, 724 (3d Cir.2005). As we have explained, habeas relief is available only if the petitioner demonstrates that \"Supreme Court precedent requires an <i>outcome</i> contrary to that reached by the relevant state court.\" <i>O'Brien v. Dubois,</i> 145 F.3d 16, 24-25 (1st Cir.1998) (emphasis added), <i>abrogated on other grounds, McCambridge v. Hall,</i> 303 F.3d 24 (1st Cir.2002) (en banc). Accordingly, Aspen may not obtain habeas relief if, applying the correct <i>Batson</i> standard, he would still not prevail on his claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider de novo whether Aspen is entitled to relief under the correct <i>Batson</i> standard. <i>See Bronshtein,</i> 404 F.3d at 724 (considering de novo whether habeas petitioner established prima facie case under <i>Batson</i> where state appellate court had incorrectly applied <i>Batson</i> standard); <i>Paulino v. Castro,</i> 371 F.3d 1083, 1090 (9th Cir.2004) (similar). In so doing, we limit our review to facts gleaned from the state court record concerning jury selection at Aspen's trial. The trial court conducted a three-day voir dire. After potential jurors had been stricken for cause, the venire consisted of twenty-eight men and sixteen women, and the first panel of prospective jurors included twelve men and four women, with no distinction as to which four would be alternates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each side was allowed sixteen peremptory challenges. In the prosecutor's first round of peremptory challenges, she struck six men. These six men were replaced by four men and two women. The prosecutor struck one of the male replacements who was, in turn, replaced by another man. She then stated that she was content with the jury. At this point, the panel consisted of ten men and six women.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court then permitted Aspen to exercise his peremptory challenges. He struck five women and two men. These seven potential jurors were replaced by three men and four women. Aspen then struck three more women. Two men and one woman were seated as replacements, and Aspen challenged the woman. A man was selected to replace the last stricken juror, and Aspen then stated that he was satisfied. At this point, the jury consisted of fourteen men and two women.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor then struck five men. Two men and three women were seated as replacements, and the prosecutor challenged one of the men. A woman replaced the stricken man and the prosecutor stated that she was satisfied.

They were replaced by one woman and two men. Aspen challenged one of the men, who was replaced by another man. Aspen announced that he was satisfied, and the prosecutor agreed, even though she had three challenges remaining. As did the original panel, the final jury, with alternates, consisted of twelve men and four women.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In total, the prosecutor had exercised thirteen peremptory challenges, all of which were against prospective male jurors. Aspen had exercised fifteen challenges, twelve of which were against prospective female jurors. He contends that the prosecutor's use of all of her challenges against men is sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case under <i>Batson</i> and <i>J.E.B.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have cautioned that a party \"who advances a <i>Batson</i> argument ordinarily should come forward with facts, not just numbers alone.\" <i>Bergodere,</i> 40 F.3d at 516.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Here, Aspen has relied entirely on the number of prosecution strikes against men. It is at least questionable whether this evidence is adequate to surpass the prima facie hurdle. <i>See United States v. Esparsen,</i> 930 F.2d 1461, 1467 (10th Cir. 1991) (\"By itself, the number of challenges used against members of a particular [group] is not sufficient to establish . . . a prima facie case.\"); <i>Sangineto-Miranda,</i> 859 F.2d at 1521 (stating that evidence \"standing alone\" that the government exercised all of its peremptory challenges against black members of the venire \"does not raise the necessary inference of purposeful discrimination\" to establish a prima facie case). But even assuming that Aspen could establish a prima facie case, it is clear that he cannot ultimately establish a <i>Batson</i> violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering <i>Batson</i> claims, courts examine both numeric and non-numeric forms of evidence. Relevant numeric evidence includes the percentage of strikes directed against members of a particular group, <i>e.g., Paulino,</i> 371 F.3d at 1091, the percentage of a particular group removed from the venire by the challenged strikes, <i>e.g., Turner v. Marshall,</i> 63 F.3d 807, 813 (9th Cir.1995), <i>abrogated on other grounds, Tolbert v. Page,</i> 182 F.3d 677, 684 (9th Cir.1999), and a comparison of the percentage of a group's representation in the venire to its representation on the jury, <i>e.g., United States v. Sangineto-Miranda,</i> 859 F.2d 1501, 1521-22 (6th Cir. 1988). Relevant non-numeric evidence includes the striking party's questions and statements during the voir dire, <i>e.g., Brewer,</i> 119 F.3d at 1004, whether the striking party had unused peremptory challenges through which he or she could have eliminated more members of the allegedly targeted group, <i>e.g., United States v. Allison,</i> 908 F.2d 1531, 1538 (11th Cir.1990), apparent non-discriminatory reasons for striking potential jurors based on their voir dire answers, <i>e.g., United States v. Stephens,</i> 421 F.3d 503, 515-16 (7th Cir.2005), and whether similarly situated jurors from outside the allegedly targeted group were permitted to serve, <i>Boyd v. Newland,</i> 467 F.3d 1139, 1148-50 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looking first to the numeric evidence, the prosecutor's strikes were all aimed at men. But these challenges removed only forty-six percent of the males from the venire and even after the prosecutor's strikes (not all of which were used), men remained the dominant group. This fact at least tends to mitigate an inference of discrimination. <i>See United States v. Brisk,</i> 171 F.3d 514, 523 (7th Cir.1999) (holding no <i>Batson</i> violation established, in part, because even though two-thirds of strikes were directed against women, the strikes did not remove a significant percentage of the women in the venire).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, the strikes had little effect on the composition of the actual jury seated. Indeed, the jury agreed to by the prosecutor was seventy-five percent male, even though the original venire, after the strikes for cause, was only sixty-three percent male. <i>See Escobar-de Jesus,</i> 187 F.3d at 165 (no <i>Batson</i> violation based on strikes of African-American jurors where six African-Americans served on the jury); <i>Sangineto-Miranda,</i> 859 F.2d at 1522 (treating the fact that the \"percentage of minority members [on] the ultimate jury is the same or greater\" than in the venire as tending to \"negate the inference of discrimination\"). Additionally, the final jury agreed to by the prosecutor had the exact gender composition as the original panel faced by the prosecutor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aspen's emphasis on the raw number of strikes made against men loses force when this species of numeric evidence is considered in context. The context here was that Aspen struck most of the women members of the venire and that women constituted a minority of the venire from the outset. In fact, Aspen struck seventy-five percent of the prospective female jurors. The result was that the panels of potential jurors faced by the prosecutor were predominantly male. Indeed, most of the time, the potential juror panel from which the prosecutor made her strikes was between sixty-nine percent and eighty-eight percent male. Therefore, the raw number of strikes against men is not particularly telling in these circumstances because Aspen's use of peremptory challenges kept the number of men on the panel disproportionately high.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See United States v. Ochoa-Vasquez,</i> 428 F.3d 1015, 1047 n. 47 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that strikes made by the party raising a <i>Batson</i> claim are relevant to the extent that they explain how the composition of the final jury was formed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The non-numeric evidence further supports the conclusion that a discriminatory motive did not infect the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges. There are no voir dire statements or questions by the prosecutor that suggest a discriminatory motive. Moreover, seven of the jurors challenged by the prosecutor provided voir dire answers that could reasonably have been understood to mean that the jurors may have been inclined to acquit the defendant even if he committed the conduct alleged. In particular, certain male jurors questioned whether it was legally possible for a person to rape a member of his own family, or whether a woman could, as a factual matter, be raped without having provoked the attack.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Finally, the prosecutor could have challenged three more men from the male-dominated panel finally selected but did not do so. In the circumstances at hand, this is an important indicum. <i>See Bronshtein,</i> 404 F.3d at 724 (finding relevant to <i>Batson</i> analysis that the prosecutor \"passed up\" the opportunity to strike other prospective jurors who were members of the allegedly targeted group).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the Appeals Court misapplied <i>Batson</i> and <i>J.E.B.</i> in analyzing Aspen's equal protection claim. But, even if the correct standard had been applied, Aspen would not have benefitted because the totality of the circumstances demonstrates that the prosecutor did not issue peremptory challenges on the basis of gender.

The Commonwealth correctly states that an \"inference\" of discrimination is the <i>Batson</i> prima facie case standard. But it is apparent that the Appeals Court equated an \"inference\" of discrimination with a showing that gender was the \"likely\" reason that the prosecutor exercised her peremptory challenges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> As explained above, <i>Batson</i> establishes that the \"inference of discrimination\" standard is not so demanding.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See Wade v.

In so doing, we limit our review to facts gleaned from the state court record concerning jury selection at Aspen's trial. The trial court conducted a three-day voir dire. After potential jurors had been stricken for cause, the venire consisted of twenty-eight men and sixteen women, and the first panel of prospective jurors included twelve men and four women, with no distinction as to which four would be alternates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Each side was allowed sixteen peremptory challenges.

The prosecutor struck one of the male replacements who was, in turn, replaced by another man. She then stated that she was content with the jury. At this point, the panel consisted of ten men and six women.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial court then permitted Aspen to exercise his peremptory challenges. He struck five women and two men. These seven potential jurors were replaced by three men and four women. Aspen then struck three more women. Two men and one woman were seated as replacements, and Aspen challenged the woman. A man was selected to replace the last stricken juror, and Aspen then stated that he was satisfied. At this point, the jury consisted of fourteen men and two women.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor then struck five men.

They were replaced by one woman and two men. Aspen challenged one of the men, who was replaced by another man. Aspen announced that he was satisfied, and the prosecutor agreed, even though she had three challenges remaining. As did the original panel, the final jury, with alternates, consisted of twelve men and four women.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In total, the prosecutor had exercised thirteen peremptory challenges, all of which were against prospective male jurors. Aspen had exercised fifteen challenges, twelve of which were against prospective female jurors. He contends that the prosecutor's use of all of her challenges against men is sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case under <i>Batson</i> and <i>J.E.B.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have cautioned that a party \"who advances a <i>Batson</i> argument ordinarily should come forward with facts, not just numbers alone.\" <i>Bergodere,</i> 40 F.3d at 516.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Here, Aspen has relied entirely on the number of prosecution strikes against men. It is at least questionable whether this evidence is adequate to surpass the prima facie hurdle. <i>See United States v. Esparsen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"559573\"><a href=\"/opinion/559573/united-states-v-anthony-esparsen-united-states-of-america-v-kelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">930</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1461</span></a></span>, 1467 (10th Cir. 1991) (\"By itself, the number of challenges used against members of a particular [group] is not sufficient to establish . . . a prima facie case.\"); <i>Sangineto-Miranda,</i> 859 F.2d at 1521 (stating that evidence \"standing alone\" that the government exercised all of its peremptory challenges against black members of the venire \"does not raise the necessary inference of purposeful discrimination\" to establish a prima facie case). But even assuming that Aspen could establish a prima facie case, it is clear that he cannot ultimately establish a <i>Batson</i> violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering <i>Batson</i> claims, courts examine both numeric and non-numeric forms of evidence. Relevant numeric evidence includes the percentage of strikes directed against members of a particular group, <i>e.g., Paulino,</i> 371 F.3d at 1091, the percentage of a particular group removed from the venire by the challenged strikes, <i>e.g., Turner v. Marshall,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702369\"><a href=\"/opinion/702369/95-cal-daily-op-serv-6059-95-daily-journal-dar-10394-robert-turner/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">807</span></a></span>, 813 (9th Cir.1995), <i>abrogated on other grounds, Tolbert v.

Relevant non-numeric evidence includes the striking party's questions and statements during the voir dire, <i>e.g., Brewer,</i> 119 F.3d at 1004, whether the striking party had unused peremptory challenges through which he or she could have eliminated more members of the allegedly targeted group, <i>e.g., United States v. Allison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"545197\"><a href=\"/opinion/545197/united-states-v-steven-allison-anthinino-galloway/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1531</span></a></span>, 1538 (11th Cir.1990), apparent non-discriminatory reasons for striking potential jurors based on their voir dire answers, <i>e.g., United States v. Stephens,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791700\"><a href=\"/opinion/791700/united-states-v-wayne-stephens/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></a></span>, 515-16 (7th Cir.2005), and whether similarly situated jurors from outside the allegedly targeted group were permitted to serve, <i>Boyd v. Newland,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1139</span></span>, 1148-50 (9th Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Looking first to the numeric evidence, the prosecutor's strikes were all aimed at men. But these challenges removed only forty-six percent of the males from the venire and even after the prosecutor's strikes (not all of which were used), men remained the dominant group. This fact at least tends to mitigate an inference of discrimination. <i>See United States v. Brisk,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"762579\"><a href=\"/opinion/762579/united-states-v-patricia-m-brisk-lucy-a-beauprey-isabel-m-cloud/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">514</span></a></span>, 523 (7th Cir.1999) (holding no <i>Batson</i> violation established, in part, because even though two-thirds of strikes were directed against women, the strikes did not remove a significant percentage of the women in the venire).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More importantly, the strikes had little effect on the composition of the actual jury seated. Indeed, the jury agreed to by the prosecutor was seventy-five percent male, even though the original venire, after the strikes for cause, was only sixty-three percent male. <i>See Escobar-de Jesus,</i> 187 F.3d at 165 (no <i>Batson</i> violation based on strikes of African-American jurors where six African-Americans served on the jury); <i>Sangineto-Miranda,</i> 859 F.2d at 1522 (treating the fact that the \"percentage of minority members [on] the ultimate jury is the same or greater\" than in the venire as tending to \"negate the inference of discrimination\"). Additionally, the final jury agreed to by the prosecutor had the exact gender composition as the original panel faced by the prosecutor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aspen's emphasis on the raw number of strikes made against men loses force when this species of numeric evidence is considered in context. The context here was that Aspen struck most of the women members of the venire and that women constituted a minority of the venire from the outset. In fact, Aspen struck seventy-five percent of the prospective female jurors. The result was that the panels of potential jurors faced by the prosecutor were predominantly male. Indeed, most of the time, the potential juror panel from which the prosecutor made her strikes was between sixty-nine percent and eighty-eight percent male. Therefore, the raw number of strikes against men is not particularly telling in these circumstances because Aspen's use of peremptory challenges kept the number of men on the panel disproportionately high.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See United States v. Ochoa-Vasquez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792413\"><a href=\"/opinion/792413/united-states-v-fabio-ochoa-vasquez-aka-julio-aka-pepe-united/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1015</span></a></span>, 1047 n. 47 (11th Cir.2005) (stating that strikes made by the party raising a <i>Batson</i> claim are relevant to the extent that they explain how the composition of the final jury was formed).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The non-numeric evidence further supports the conclusion that a discriminatory motive did not infect the prosecutor's use of peremptory challenges. There are no voir dire statements or questions by the prosecutor that suggest a discriminatory motive. Moreover, seven of the jurors challenged by the prosecutor provided voir dire answers that could reasonably have been understood to mean that the jurors may have been inclined to acquit the defendant even if he committed the conduct alleged. In particular, certain male jurors questioned whether it was legally possible for a person to rape a member of his own family, or whether a woman could, as a factual matter, be raped without having provoked the attack.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Finally, the prosecutor could have challenged three more men from the male-dominated panel finally selected but did not do so. In the circumstances at hand, this is an important indicum. <i>See Bronshtein,</i> 404 F.3d at 724 (finding relevant to <i>Batson</i> analysis that the prosecutor \"passed up\" the opportunity to strike other prospective jurors who were members of the allegedly targeted group).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the Appeals Court misapplied <i>Batson</i> and <i>J.E.B.</i> in analyzing Aspen's equal protection claim. But, even if the correct standard had been applied, Aspen would not have benefitted because the totality of the circumstances demonstrates that the prosecutor did not issue peremptory challenges on the basis of gender. Accordingly, Aspen's habeas petition was correctly denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Decisions from the lower federal courts may help inform the AEDPA analysis to the extent that they state the clearly established federal law determined by the Supreme Court<i>See Ouber v.
