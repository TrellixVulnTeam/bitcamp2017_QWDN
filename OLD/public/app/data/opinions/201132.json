R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 04-1400\n\n                         LUISA RIVERA-LUGARO,\n\n                         Plaintiff, Appellee,\n\n                                     v.\n\n                             JOHNNY RULLAN,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n          [Hon. Jaime Pieras, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Anabelle Rodriguez, Secretary of Justice, Ivonne Palerm,\nDeputy Secretary of Justice, Frederic Chardon Dubos, Julio C.\nAlejandro Serrano and Landron & Vera, LLP on Motion for appellant.\n     Jose Juan Nazario De La Rosa, Nazario & Santiago and Charles\nS. Hey-Maestre on Motion for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                              July 14, 2004\n\f      Per Curiam.      Because the case arises on a motion to dismiss\n\nthe complaint and not on summary judgment we must assume that facts\n\nmost favorable to plaintiff within the confines of the complaint\n\ncould be proved; and on such an assumption, there appear to be\n\npossible motivations for the discharge that could give rise to\n\nfirst amendment claims under clearly established law even though\n\nthe plaintiff occupied a position that could justify a discharge\n\nbased upon ordinary political considerations.             Accordingly, it is\n\nnot   possible    to   determine   at    this   stage   whether   a   claim   of\n\nqualified immunity should prevail.\n\n      Affirmed.    See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27(c)\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f",
