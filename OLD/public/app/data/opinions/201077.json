Pedro De Jesus Mateo appeals his\n\nconviction for conspiring to possess narcotics with the intent to\n\ndistribute and the resulting sentence imposed.                We affirm the\n\njudgment.\n\n                               I. Background\n\n            In the late 1980's, De Jesus befriended Orlando Rosa\n\nRodriguez in Ponce, Puerto Rico.           In the beginning of 1990, Rosa\n\nbegan a drug trafficking organization operating in the Belgica Ward\n\nof Ponce.       During the fall of 1990, Rosa expanded the enterprise\n\nand moved it to the Portugues Public Housing Project in Ponce.             By\n\nthe end of 1990, De Jesus was working for Rosa, processing heroin\n\nand cocaine and helping procure additional drug supply.              In early\n\n1992, Rosa gave De Jesus control of a marijuana \"drug point\" in the\n\nPortugues Housing Project.\n\n            In 1995, Rosa was incarcerated for drug offenses but\n\ncontinued to operate the enterprise from prison.               Rosa left two\n\nassociates in charge of the operation.              These associates were\n\ndelinquent in collecting money, so Rosa replaced them with his\n\nsister    and    De   Jesus.   In   this    capacity,   De   Jesus   collected\n\ndelinquent debts, processed heroin, and operated the heroin \"drug\n\npoint.\"     For his services, Rosa paid De Jesus $200 per week.             De\n\nJesus eventually withdrew from the organization in the fall of\n\n1997.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\f          On    these   facts,    a   jury     convicted     De     Jesus    of\n\nparticipating in a conspiracy to possess cocaine and heroin with\n\nthe intent to distribute operating in Ponce from 1990 through the\n\nfall of 1997.    See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) & 846.                The district\n\ncourt sentenced De Jesus to life in prison because this was his\n\nthird conviction for a drug-related felony.                See 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(b)(1)(A).\n\n                            II. Discussion\n\n          De Jesus raises two issues on appeal.            First, he claims\n\nthat the district court erred by declining to order a mistrial\n\nafter Rosa provided testimony implicating him in criminal acts that\n\nwere beyond the scope of the conspiracy.        Second, he contends that\n\nthe district    court   erroneously   relied    on   his    two    prior    drug\n\nconvictions to impose an enhanced sentence under 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(b)(1)(A) because the prior convictions comprised conduct that\n\nwas part of the instant conspiracy offense.\n\n          A. Mistrial\n\n          De Jesus identifies three points in Rosa's testimony\n\nwhere Rosa improperly implicated him in criminal conduct that was\n\noutside of the conspiracy.       First, Rosa testified about his own\n\ninvolvement in a 1990 murder.     Defense counsel objected that Rosa\n\nimplicated De Jesus in the murder by gesturing toward De Jesus when\n\ndiscussing the crime.    The district court responded by instructing\n\nRosa to confine his answers to his own criminal conduct, but\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fdefense counsel, not satisfied, moved for a mistrial.           The court\n\ndenied the motion, noting that it \"did not see a gesture as\n\ndramatic as the one described,\" and that it was not as \"clear or\n\nunambiguous [as defense counsel] may have suggested.\"\n\n            Second, Rosa testified that De Jesus worked packaging\n\ndrugs. Rosa then stated, \"In 1991 he was in prison.\"1 Defense\n\ncounsel objected, and the district court struck the comment.\n\nFinally, Rosa testified about his last drug transaction with De\n\nJesus.   Rosa stated that he had asked De Jesus to help him obtain\n\ndrugs while he (Rosa) was in prison.       Defense counsel objected to\n\nthis testimony because this act was outside the scope of the\n\nconspiracy and requested a mistrial.        The court again struck the\n\ntestimony but declined to order a mistrial.2\n\n            De Jesus contends that, individually and combined, the\n\neffect of    this   improper   testimony   was   so   prejudicial   that   a\n\nmistrial was warranted. We review the district court's decision to\n\n\n\n     1\n      There is some confusion in the record concerning whether this\nstatement was made by Rosa or the prosecutor. De Jesus claims that\nthe statement was made by Rosa and there is substantial record\nsupport for that view. We therefore have considered the claim in\nthis light. But even if the prosecutor had made the statement, our\nconclusion would remain the same because, as discussed in the text,\nthe district court's curative instructions sufficiently remedied\nany prejudice. See infra at 6-7.\n     2\n       The court ruled that this testimony concerned an act that\nwas within the scope of the conspiracy and would normally be\nadmissible.   But, because the government had filed a pretrial\nnotice representing that this evidence would not be introduced in\nits case-in-chief, the court struck the testimony.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fdeny a mistrial motion for an abuse of discretion.          See United\n\nStates v. Bradshaw, 281 F.3d 278, 284 (1st Cir. 2002).      A mistrial\n\nis a last resort that is only ordered if the demonstrated harm\n\ncannot be cured by less drastic means.          See United States v.\n\nRullan-Rivera, 60 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n          De    Jesus   focuses   substantial   attention   on   Rosa's\n\n\"gesture\" supposedly implicating him in a 1990 murder.       Testimony\n\nclearly implicating De Jesus in a murder outside of the charged\n\nconspiracy could be thought to have caused substantial prejudice.\n\nThe difficulty with this argument, however, is that the district\n\ncourt found that Rosa's gesture was neither as \"dramatic\" nor\n\n\"unambiguous\" as De Jesus suggests.         \"The trial court has a\n\nsuperior point of vantage\" and \"it is only rarely--and in extremely\n\ncompelling circumstances--that an appellate panel, informed by a\n\ncold record, will venture to reverse a trial judge's on-the-spot\n\ndecision.\"     United States v. Freeman, 208 F.3d 332, 339 (1st Cir.\n\n2000) (internal citations and quotations omitted).          Neither De\n\nJesus's brief nor our own review of the record provides a basis for\n\ndisregarding the district court's view of events and its conclusion\n\nthat De Jesus was not substantially prejudiced by the incident.\n\nSee United States v. Pierro, 32 F.3d 611, 617 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(\"[B]attles over the need for a mistrial most often will be won or\n\nlost in the district court\").\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f            For Rosa's two inadmissible comments, the district court\n\nprovided prompt and forceful curative instructions.         Immediately\n\nafter Rosa's comment, \"He was in prison in 1991,\" the court told\n\nthe jury \"to disregard the answer.\"         Similarly, just after Rosa\n\ndescribed De Jesus arranging to bring him drugs in prison, the\n\ncourt instructed, \"Jurors, the witness's evidence from the last few\n\nquestions concerning what he described as a transaction when he was\n\nin prison, all that evidence is stricken, and you will disregard it\n\nin your decision in this case.\"           Also as part of its final\n\ninstructions, the district court reminded the jurors to disregard\n\nstricken testimony:\n\n            There was at least one and maybe several\n            occasions on which an answer or a portion\n            of an answer may have been given by a\n            witness, and it was excluded from the\n            evidence.   You may recall that I did\n            that.   Evidence that I ordered to be\n            stricken, you are to disregard and put\n            out of your minds.    It is not part of\n            your consideration and may not be the\n            subject of your discussion in the jury\n            room.\n\n            Within wide margins, the prejudice caused by improper\n\ntestimony   can   be   addressed   by   providing   appropriate   curative\n\ninstructions similar to those supplied here.        See United States v.\n\nSepúlveda, 15 F.3d 1161, 1184 (1st Cir. 1993).           This rule is a\n\ncorollary of the presumption that \"juries follow instructions\"\n\nunless there is \"a sufficient showing that the offending testimony\n\nreasonably could not have been ignored and that serious prejudice\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\flikely resulted.\"          United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez, 219 F.3d 37,\n\n48 (1st Cir. 2000) (quotations omitted).             De Jesus has not made this\n\nshowing.       The statement, \"He was in prison,\" provided the jury with\n\nlittle detail, and it is not altogether clear that it referred to De\n\nJesus, as Rosa blurted out the statement when there was no question\n\npending.\n\n           Further, Rosa's testimony concerning the later transaction\n\nin which De Jesus brought drugs to Rosa in prison, also excluded by\n\nthe    court    with   a   curative   instruction,     constituted   additional\n\nevidence concerning De Jesus's work in furthering the conspiracy.\n\nSee Bradshaw, 281 F.3d at 285 (affirming denial of motion for\n\nmistrial where inadmissible evidence was largely cumulative).\n\n               Finally, the strong proof of De Jesus's guilt militates\n\nagainst disturbing the district court's decision against declaring\n\na mistrial.       See United States v. DiSanto, 86 F.3d 1238, 1249 (1st\n\nCir. 1996) (affirming denial of mistrial motion because evidence was\n\nstrong); United States v. Belardo-Quiñones, 71 F.3d 941, 945 (1st\n\nCir. 1995) (similar); United States v. Bello-Pérez, 977 F.2d 664,\n\n672 (1st Cir. 1992) (similar). The government presented testimony\n\nfrom Rosa and his sister chronicling De Jesus's involvement in the\n\nconspiracy, an audio tape recording of De Jesus arranging a drug\n\ntransaction and discussing a debt that one of the co-conspirators\n\nowed    Rosa,    and   another    tape   recording    of   two   co-conspirators\n\ndiscussing that De Jesus was no longer going to work for Rosa.                De\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fJesus's entire case consisted of calling Rosa to question his\n\ncredibility.          In short, this was not a close case.                    For these\n\nreasons, the district court's denial of De Jesus's motion for a\n\nmistrial        was         not    an        abuse     of       discretion.\n\n               B. Sentencing\n\n               The district court sentenced De Jesus to a life sentence\n\npursuant to the sentencing enhancement provisions of 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(b)(1)(A).         In relevant part, this section provides that if a\n\nperson is convicted of conspiring to possess in excess of a certain\n\namount of controlled substance with the intent to distribute \"after\n\ntwo or more prior convictions for felony drug offenses have become\n\nfinal, such person shall be sentenced to a mandatory term of life\n\nimprisonment without release.\"                21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A).         De Jesus\n\nwas convicted in Puerto Rico Superior Court of possessing cocaine in\n\nJanuary    1991       and    of   possessing        marijuana    with   the   intent   to\n\ndistribute in November 1991.                  Both crimes occurred in Ponce and\n\nthere is no dispute that they constitute felonies under Puerto Rico\n\nlaw.\n\n               De Jesus claims that these prior convictions should not\n\ncount for purposes of applying the sentencing enhancement under 21\n\nU.S.C.     §    841(b)(1)(A).           He    argues     that,    because     the   prior\n\nconvictions occurred during the time period and in the geographic\n\nlocation       of   the     conspiracy       charged    in   this   case,     the   prior\n\nconvictions represent \"the same criminal conduct\" as the conspiracy\n\n\n                                              -8-\n\fconviction   and     consequently     \"should   not   count       toward     the\n\nenhancement.\"\n\n          De Jesus makes this argument by asserting that, under the\n\nSentencing   Guidelines,    all     three   convictions    (the    two     prior\n\nconvictions and the conspiracy conviction) would be grouped togther\n\nas related cases pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2 and therefore should\n\nnot count as separate convictions for purposes of applying 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(A).      This argument misconstrues the purpose of the\n\nSentencing Guidelines.      The Guidelines focus on the length and\n\nnature of the sentence, not the fact of conviction.           Whether prior\n\nconvictions count for purposes of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A) is a\n\nmatter of statutory construction, not Guideline application.                 See\n\nUnited States v. Blackwood, 913 F.2d 139, 145 n.4 (4th Cir. 1990);\n\nsee also United States v. Maxey, 989 F.2d 303, 307-08 (9th Cir.\n\n1993)   (rejecting    similar     argument).     Indeed,    the    Guidelines\n\nspecifically provide that statutorily required minimum sentences\n\nmust be applied in lieu of the Guideline range if the statutory\n\nminimum is longer.     See U.S.S.G. § 5G1.1.\n\n          But that the Guidelines do not provide the analytical\n\nvehicle for resolving De Jesus's argument does not end the matter.\n\n\"Prior felony drug convictions will be           counted separately for\n\npurposes of 21 U.S.C. § 841(b) only when they represent distinct\n\ncriminal episodes.\" United States v. Martinez-Medina, 279 F.3d 105,\n\n123 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing       United States v. Gillies, 851 F.2d 492,\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f497 (1st Cir. 1988)).      De Jesus contends that his prior convictions\n\ndo not represent \"distinct criminal episodes\" because they are part\n\nand   parcel   of   his   participation   in   the   conspiracy.    Circuit\n\nprecedent forecloses this argument.        See Martinez-Medina, 279 F.3d\n\nat 123.\n\n           In Martinez-Medina, we stated that:\n\n           An ongoing course of criminal conduct such\n           as narcotics trafficking may involve many\n           such criminal episodes, each a discrete\n           occurrence.     The fact that all are\n           related, part of a series, or part of a\n           continuous course of criminal dealing,\n           does not necessarily render them a\n           \"single\" criminal episode, particularly\n           where the episodes occur over time. To so\n           hold would insulate the very career\n           criminals the statute is designed to\n           reach--those   continuously   engaged   in\n           criminal conduct.\n\nId. (quoting Maxey, 989 F.2d at 307).          Consequently, we held that\n\nthe district court properly imposed a life sentence under 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 841(b)(1)(A) because the defendant's prior convictions, although\n\npart of one drug trafficking conspiracy, stemmed from several\n\ntransactions, occurring several months apart.         See id.   So too here.\n\nDe Jesus's prior convictions were for separate drug transactions\n\nthat occurred eleven months apart.        See id.; see also United States\n\nv. Gray, 152 F.3d 816, 821-22 (8th Cir. 1998) (stating that drug\n\ntransactions    occurring    one-day   apart    which   required   separate\n\nplanning and execution constitute distinct criminal episodes under\n\n21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)); United States v. Griffin, 109 F.3d 706,\n\n708 (11th Cir. 1997) (\"Two drug transactions occurring on different\n                                   -10-\n\fdays--albeit within the same week and in the same general location--\n\nconstitute separate unrelated offenses for purposes of sentencing\n\nunder 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A).\"). Accordingly, the district court\n\ncorrectly counted them as prior convictions for purposes of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A).3\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      De Jesus attempts to distinguish Martinez-Medina on the basis\nthat the government presented evidence of marijuana trafficking in\nthe instant case which was the same conduct underlying De Jesus's\nprior marijuana conviction. As explained in the text, Martinez-\nMedina holds that each conviction arising from a distinct criminal\nepisode counts as a separate conviction for purposes of 21 U.S.C.\n§ 841(b)(1)(A) even though this same conduct is within the scope of\nthe conspiracy. See supra at 10. The dispositive point here is\nnot that evidence of De Jesus distributing marijuana was presented\nat his conspiracy trial but rather that his prior cocaine\nconviction was a separate criminal episode from his prior marijuana\nconviction even though the conduct underlying both convictions was\narguably part of the same conspiracy.    As for any claim that the\nconspiracy comprised the same episode as either of the two prior\nconvictions, the short answer is that the conviction in this case\nwas for conspiring to distribute heroin and cocaine, an episode\ncontinuing well beyond either of the prior convictions for discrete\nepisodes of possession and distribution.\n                                -11-\n\f",

Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Jesus raises two issues on appeal. First, he claims that the district court erred by declining to order a mistrial after Rosa provided testimony implicating him in criminal acts that were beyond the scope of the conspiracy. Second, he contends that the district court erroneously relied on his two prior drug convictions to impose an enhanced sentence under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) because the prior convictions comprised conduct that was part of the instant conspiracy offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Mistrial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Jesus identifies three points in Rosa's testimony where Rosa improperly implicated him in criminal conduct that was outside of the conspiracy. First, Rosa testified about his own involvement in a 1990 murder. Defense counsel objected that Rosa implicated De Jesus in the murder by gesturing toward De Jesus when discussing the crime. The district court responded by instructing Rosa to confine his answers to his own criminal conduct, but defense counsel, not satisfied, moved for a mistrial. The court denied the motion, noting that it \"did not see a gesture as dramatic as the one described,\" and that it was not as \"clear or unambiguous [as defense counsel] may have suggested.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Rosa testified that De Jesus worked packaging drugs. Rosa then stated, \"In 1991 he was in prison.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Defense counsel objected, and the district court struck the comment. Finally, Rosa testified about his last drug transaction with De Jesus. Rosa stated that he had asked De Jesus to help him obtain drugs while he (Rosa) was in prison. Defense counsel objected to this testimony because this act was outside the scope of the conspiracy and requested a mistrial. The court again struck the testimony but declined to order a mistrial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Jesus contends that, individually and combined, the effect of this improper testimony was so prejudicial that a mistrial was warranted. We review the district court's decision to deny a mistrial motion for an abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d 278, 284 (1st Cir.2002). A mistrial is a last resort that is only ordered if the demonstrated harm cannot be cured by less drastic means. <i>See United States v. Rullan-Rivera,</i> 60 F.3d 16, 18 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Jesus focuses substantial attention on Rosa's \"gesture\" supposedly implicating him in a 1990 murder. Testimony clearly implicating De Jesus in a murder outside of the charged conspiracy could be thought to have caused substantial prejudice. The difficulty with this argument, however, is that the district court found that Rosa's gesture was neither as \"dramatic\" nor \"unambiguous\" as De Jesus suggests. \"The trial court has a superior point of vantage\" and \"it is only rarely &#8212; and in extremely compelling circumstances &#8212; that an appellate panel, informed by a cold record, will venture to reverse a trial judge's on-the-spot decision.\" <i>United States v. Freeman,</i> 208 F.3d 332, 339 (1st Cir.2000) (internal citations and quotations omitted). Neither De Jesus's brief nor our own review of the record provides a basis for disregarding the district court's view of events and its conclusion that De Jesus was not substantially prejudiced by the incident. <i>See United States v. Pierro,</i> 32 F.3d 611, 617 (1st Cir.1994) (\"[B]attles over the need for a mistrial most often will be won or lost in the district court\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For Rosa's two inadmissible comments, the district court provided prompt and forceful curative instructions. Immediately after Rosa's comment, \"He was in prison in 1991,\" the court told the jury \"to disregard the answer.\" Similarly, just after Rosa described De Jesus arranging to bring him drugs in prison, the court instructed, \"Jurors, the witness's evidence from the last few questions concerning what he described as a transaction when he was in prison, all that evidence is stricken, and you will disregard it in your decision in this case.\" Also as part of its final instructions, the district court reminded the jurors to disregard stricken testimony:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was at least one and maybe several occasions on which an answer or a portion of an answer may have been given by a witness, and it was excluded from the evidence. You may recall that I did that. Evidence that I ordered to be stricken, you are to disregard and put out of your minds. It is not part of your consideration and may not be the subject of your discussion in the jury room.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Within wide margins, the prejudice caused by improper testimony can be addressed by providing appropriate curative instructions similar to those supplied here. <i>See United States v. Sep&#250;lveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1184 (1st Cir.1993). This rule is a corollary of the presumption that \"juries follow instructions\" unless there is \"a sufficient showing that the offending testimony reasonably could not have been ignored and that serious prejudice likely resulted.\" <i>United States v. Gonzalez-Vazquez,</i> 219 F.3d 37, 48 (1st Cir.2000) (quotations omitted). De Jesus has not made this showing. The statement, \"He was in prison,\" provided the jury with little detail, and it is not altogether clear that it referred to De Jesus, as Rosa blurted out the statement when there was no question pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Rosa's testimony concerning the later transaction in which De Jesus brought drugs to Rosa in prison, also excluded by the court with a curative instruction, constituted additional evidence concerning De Jesus's work in furthering the conspiracy. <i>See Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d at 285 (affirming denial of motion for mistrial where inadmissible evidence was largely cumulative).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the strong proof of De Jesus's guilt militates against disturbing the district court's decision against declaring a mistrial. <i>See United States v. DiSanto,</i> 86 F.3d 1238, 1249 (1st Cir.1996) (affirming denial of mistrial motion because evidence was strong); <i>United States v. Belardo-Qui&#241;ones,</i> 71 F.3d 941, 945 (1st Cir.1995) (similar); <i>United States v. Bello-P&#233;rez,</i> 977 F.2d 664, 672 (1st Cir.1992) (similar). The government presented testimony from Rosa and his sister chronicling De Jesus's involvement in the conspiracy, an audio tape recording of De Jesus arranging a drug transaction and discussing a debt that one of the co-conspirators owed Rosa, and another tape recording of two co-conspirators discussing that De Jesus was no longer going to work for Rosa. De Jesus's entire case consisted of calling Rosa to question his credibility. In short, this was not a close case. For these reasons, the district court's denial of De Jesus's motion for a mistrial was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced De Jesus to a life sentence pursuant to the sentencing enhancement provisions of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). In relevant part, this section provides that if a person is convicted of conspiring to possess in excess of a certain amount of controlled substance with the intent to distribute \"after two or more prior convictions for felony drug offenses have become final, such person shall be sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without release.\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). De Jesus was convicted in Puerto Rico Superior Court of possessing cocaine in January 1991 and of possessing marijuana with the intent to distribute in November 1991. Both crimes occurred in Ponce and there is no dispute that they constitute felonies under Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Jesus claims that these prior convictions should not count for purposes of applying the sentencing enhancement under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). He argues that, because the prior convictions occurred during the time period and in the geographic location of the conspiracy charged in this case, the prior convictions represent \"the same criminal conduct\" as the conspiracy conviction and consequently \"should not count toward the enhancement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Jesus makes this argument by asserting that, under the Sentencing Guidelines, all three convictions (the two prior convictions and the conspiracy conviction) would be grouped together as related cases pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2 and therefore should not count as separate convictions for purposes of applying 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). This argument misconstrues the purpose of the Sentencing Guidelines. The Guidelines focus on the length and nature of the sentence, not the fact of conviction. Whether prior convictions count for purposes of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) is a matter of statutory construction, not Guideline application. <i>See United States v. Blackwood,</i> 913 F.2d 139, 145 n. 4 (4th Cir.1990); <i>see also United States v. Maxey,</i> 989 F.2d 303, 307-08 (9th Cir.1993) (rejecting similar argument). Indeed, the Guidelines specifically provide that statutorily required minimum sentences must be applied <i>in lieu of</i> the Guideline range if the statutory minimum is longer. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But that the Guidelines do not provide the analytical vehicle for resolving De Jesus's argument does not end the matter. \"Prior felony drug convictions will be counted separately for purposes of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b) only when they represent distinct criminal episodes.\" <i>United States v. Martinez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d 105, 123 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <i>United States v. Gillies,</i> 851 F.2d 492, 497 (1st Cir.1988)). De Jesus contends that his prior convictions do not represent \"distinct criminal episodes\" because they are part and parcel of his participation in the conspiracy. Circuit precedent forecloses this argument. <i>See Martinez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d at 123.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Martinez-Medina,</i> we stated that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An ongoing course of criminal conduct such as narcotics trafficking may involve many such criminal episodes, each a discrete occurrence. The fact that all are related, part of a series, or part of a continuous course of criminal dealing, does not necessarily render them a \"single\" criminal episode, particularly where the episodes occur over time. To so hold would insulate the very career criminals the statute is designed to reach &#8212; those continuously engaged in criminal conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Maxey,</i> 989 F.2d at 307). Consequently, we held that the district court properly imposed a life sentence under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) because the defendant's prior convictions, although part of one drug trafficking conspiracy, stemmed from several transactions, occurring several months apart. <i>See id.</i> So too here. De Jesus's prior convictions were for separate drug transactions that occurred eleven months apart. <i>See id.; see also United States v. Gray,</i> 152 F.3d 816, 821-22 (8th Cir.1998) (stating that drug transactions occurring one-day apart which required separate planning and execution constitute distinct criminal episodes under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)); <i>United States v. Griffin,</i> 109 F.3d 706, 708 (11th Cir.1997) (\"Two drug transactions occurring on different days-albeit within the same week and in the same general location-constitute separate unrelated offenses for purposes of sentencing under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A).\"). Accordingly, the district court correctly counted them as prior convictions for purposes of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There is some confusion in the record concerning whether this statement was made by Rosa or the prosecutor. De Jesus claims that the statement was made by Rosa and there is substantial record support for that view. We therefore have considered the claim in this light. But even if the prosecutor had made the statement, our conclusion would remain the same because, as discussed in the text, the district court's curative instructions sufficiently remedied any prejudice<i>See infra</i> at 72-73.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The court ruled that this testimony concerned an act that was within the scope of the conspiracy and would normally be admissible. But, because the government had filed a pretrial notice representing that this evidence would not be introduced in its case-in-chief, the court struck the testimony</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> De Jesus attempts to distinguish<i>Martinez-Medina</i> on the basis that the government presented evidence of marijuana trafficking in the instant case which was the same conduct underlying De Jesus's prior marijuana conviction. As explained in the text, <i>Martinez-Medina</i> holds that each conviction arising from a distinct criminal episode counts as a separate conviction for purposes of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) even though this same conduct is within the scope of the conspiracy. <i>See supra</i> at 10. The dispositive point here is not that evidence of De Jesus distributing marijuana was presented at his conspiracy trial but rather that his prior cocaine conviction was a separate criminal episode from his prior marijuana conviction even though the conduct underlying both convictions was arguably part of the same conspiracy. As for any claim that the conspiracy comprised the same episode as either of the two prior convictions, the short answer is that the conviction in this case was for conspiring to distribute heroin and cocaine, an episode continuing well beyond either of the prior convictions for discrete episodes of possession and distribution.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the late 1980's, De Jesus befriended Orlando Rosa Rodriguez in Ponce, Puerto Rico. In the beginning of 1990, Rosa began a drug trafficking organization operating in the Belgica Ward of Ponce. During the fall of 1990, Rosa expanded the enterprise and moved it to the Portugues Public Housing Project in Ponce. By the end of 1990, De Jesus was working for Rosa, processing heroin and cocaine and helping procure additional drug supply. In early 1992, Rosa gave De Jesus control of a marijuana \"drug point\" in the Portugues Housing Project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1995, Rosa was incarcerated for drug offenses but continued to operate the enterprise from prison. Rosa left two associates in charge of the operation. These associates were delinquent in collecting money, so Rosa replaced them with his sister and De Jesus. In this capacity, De Jesus collected delinquent debts, processed heroin, and operated the heroin \"drug point.\" For his services, Rosa paid De Jesus $200 per week. De Jesus eventually withdrew from the organization in the fall of 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these facts, a jury convicted De Jesus of participating in a conspiracy to possess cocaine and heroin with the intent to distribute operating in Ponce from 1990 through the fall of 1997. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) &amp; 846.

The statement, \"He was in prison,\" provided the jury with little detail, and it is not altogether clear that it referred to De Jesus, as Rosa blurted out the statement when there was no question pending.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Rosa's testimony concerning the later transaction in which De Jesus brought drugs to Rosa in prison, also excluded by the court with a curative instruction, constituted additional evidence concerning De Jesus's work in furthering the conspiracy. <i>See Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d at 285 (affirming denial of motion for mistrial where inadmissible evidence was largely cumulative).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the strong proof of De Jesus's guilt militates against disturbing the district court's decision against declaring a mistrial. <i>See United States v. DiSanto,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196811\"><a href=\"/opinion/196811/united-states-v-disanto/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1238</span></a></span>, 1249 (1st Cir.1996) (affirming denial of mistrial motion because evidence was strong); <i>United States v. Belardo-Qui&#241;ones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196469\"><a href=\"/opinion/196469/united-states-v-belardo-quinones/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">941</span></a></span>, 945 (1st Cir.1995) (similar); <i>United States v.

The government presented testimony from Rosa and his sister chronicling De Jesus's involvement in the conspiracy, an audio tape recording of De Jesus arranging a drug transaction and discussing a debt that one of the co-conspirators owed Rosa, and another tape recording of two co-conspirators discussing that De Jesus was no longer going to work for Rosa. De Jesus's entire case consisted of calling Rosa to question his credibility. In short, this was not a close case. For these reasons, the district court's denial of De Jesus's motion for a mistrial was not an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sentencing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced De Jesus to a life sentence pursuant to the sentencing enhancement provisions of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). In relevant part, this section provides that if a person is convicted of conspiring to possess in excess of a certain amount of controlled substance with the intent to distribute \"after two or more prior convictions for felony drug offenses have become final, such person shall be sentenced to a mandatory term of life imprisonment without release.\" 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). De Jesus was convicted in Puerto Rico Superior Court of possessing cocaine in January 1991 and of possessing marijuana with the intent to distribute in November 1991. Both crimes occurred in Ponce and there is no dispute that they constitute felonies under Puerto Rico law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Jesus claims that these prior convictions should not count for purposes of applying the sentencing enhancement under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). He argues that, because the prior convictions occurred during the time period and in the geographic location of the conspiracy charged in this case, the prior convictions represent \"the same criminal conduct\" as the conspiracy conviction and consequently \"should not count toward the enhancement.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">De Jesus makes this argument by asserting that, under the Sentencing Guidelines, all three convictions (the two prior convictions and the conspiracy conviction) would be grouped together as related cases pursuant to U.S.S.G. &#167; 4A1.2 and therefore should not count as separate convictions for purposes of applying 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A). This argument misconstrues the purpose of the Sentencing Guidelines. The Guidelines focus on the length and nature of the sentence, not the fact of conviction. Whether prior convictions count for purposes of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) is a matter of statutory construction, not Guideline application. <i>See United States v. Blackwood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"547485\"><a href=\"/opinion/547485/united-states-v-joel-roy-blackwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">913</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 145 n. 4 (4th Cir.1990); <i>see also United States v. Maxey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"602894\"><a href=\"/opinion/602894/united-states-v-joe-sherman-maxey/\"><span class=\"volume\">989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span>, 307-08 (9th Cir.1993) (rejecting similar argument). Indeed, the Guidelines specifically provide that statutorily required minimum sentences must be applied <i>in lieu of</i> the Guideline range if the statutory minimum is longer. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.1.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But that the Guidelines do not provide the analytical vehicle for resolving De Jesus's argument does not end the matter. \"Prior felony drug convictions will be counted separately for purposes of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b) only when they represent distinct criminal episodes.\" <i>United States v. Martinez-Medina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776396\"><a href=\"/opinion/776396/united-states-v-marcos-martinez-medina-united-states-of-america-v-manuel/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 123 (1st Cir.2002) (citing <i>United States v. Gillies,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"508716\"><a href=\"/opinion/508716/united-states-v-john-j-gillies-jr/\"><span class=\"volume\">851</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 497 (1st Cir.1988)). De Jesus contends that his prior convictions do not represent \"distinct criminal episodes\" because they are part and parcel of his participation in the conspiracy. Circuit precedent forecloses this argument. <i>See Martinez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d at 123.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Martinez-Medina,</i> we stated that:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An ongoing course of criminal conduct such as narcotics trafficking may involve many such criminal episodes, each a discrete occurrence. The fact that all are related, part of a series, or part of a continuous course of criminal dealing, does not necessarily render them a \"single\" criminal episode, particularly where the episodes occur over time. To so hold would insulate the very career criminals the statute is designed to reach &#8212; those continuously engaged in criminal conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Maxey,</i> 989 F.2d at 307). Consequently, we held that the district court properly imposed a life sentence under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) because the defendant's prior convictions, although part of one drug trafficking conspiracy, stemmed from several transactions, occurring several months apart. <i>See id.</i> So too here. De Jesus's prior convictions were for separate drug transactions that occurred eleven months apart. <i>See id.; see also United States v. Gray,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"757095\"><a href=\"/opinion/757095/united-states-v-robert-dale-gray/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 821-22 (8th Cir.1998) (stating that drug transactions occurring one-day apart which required separate planning and execution constitute distinct criminal episodes under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A)); <i>United States v. Griffin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"71589\"><a href=\"/opinion/71589/united-states-v-griffin/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">706</span></a></span>, 708 (11th Cir.1997) (\"Two drug transactions occurring on different days-albeit within the same week and in the same general location-constitute separate unrelated offenses for purposes of sentencing under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A).\"). Accordingly, the district court correctly counted them as prior convictions for purposes of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> There is some confusion in the record concerning whether this statement was made by Rosa or the prosecutor. De Jesus claims that the statement was made by Rosa and there is substantial record support for that view. We therefore have considered the claim in this light. But even if the prosecutor had made the statement, our conclusion would remain the same because, as discussed in the text, the district court's curative instructions sufficiently remedied any prejudice<i>See infra</i> at 72-73.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The court ruled that this testimony concerned an act that was within the scope of the conspiracy and would normally be admissible. But, because the government had filed a pretrial notice representing that this evidence would not be introduced in its case-in-chief, the court struck the testimony</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> De Jesus attempts to distinguish<i>Martinez-Medina</i> on the basis that the government presented evidence of marijuana trafficking in the instant case which was the same conduct underlying De Jesus's prior marijuana conviction. As explained in the text, <i>Martinez-Medina</i> holds that each conviction arising from a distinct criminal episode counts as a separate conviction for purposes of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(A) even though this same conduct is within the scope of the conspiracy. <i>See supra</i> at 10. The dispositive point here is not that evidence of De Jesus distributing marijuana was presented at his conspiracy trial but rather that his prior cocaine conviction was a separate criminal episode from his prior marijuana conviction even though the conduct underlying both convictions was arguably part of the same conspiracy. As for any claim that the conspiracy comprised the same episode as either of the two prior convictions, the short answer is that the conviction in this case was for conspiring to distribute heroin and cocaine, an episode continuing well beyond either of the prior convictions for discrete episodes of possession and distribution.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
