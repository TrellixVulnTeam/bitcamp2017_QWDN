In 1986 and 1988, petitioner was convicted\n\nof three crimes of moral turpitude (larceny by check and two acts\n\nof forgery).     As a result, there are two consequences.            First, he\n\nis   removable,    see   8   U.S.C.     §    1182(a)(2)(A)(i)(I),        and   the\n\ngovernment has obtained an order of removal.              Second, because of\n\nthose   convictions,     this   court       lacks   jurisdiction    to    review\n\npetitioner's challenge to the removal order from the Board of\n\nImmigration    Appeals   (\"BIA\"),     unless     his   challenge    presents     a\n\ncolorable constitutional claim or a question of law.               See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(a)(2)(C), (D); see also Conteh v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 45, 63\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n           Petitioner cannot present either because he did not take\n\na timely appeal to the BIA from the Immigration Judge's (\"IJ\")\n\nFebruary 22, 2008 decision denying him a section 212(h) waiver, and\n\nso cannot challenge that order in this court.             Petitioner did file\n\na motion to reopen that order, but the IJ denied that motion\n\nbecause she found that he had \"presented no evidence to indicate\n\nthat the basis for this motion to reopen could not have been\n\npresented previously.\"       See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23(b)(3).          That order\n\nwas appealed to the BIA, which found the motion to reopen was\n\nproperly denied because of petitioner's failure to meet that\n\ncondition for reopening.\n\n           The    present    petition       constitutes   an   attempt    by   the\n\npetitioner to circumvent the rules for filing petitions for review\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fof BIA orders and motions to reopen.   It presents no issues of law\n\nor of constitutional rights.     Thus, we lack jurisdiction and\n\ndismiss the petition.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
