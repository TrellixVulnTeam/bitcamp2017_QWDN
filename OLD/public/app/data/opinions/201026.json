Defendants--The       McGraw-Hill\n\nCompanies, Ltd., and The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (together\n\n\"McGraw-Hill\")--successfully defended themselves against a lawsuit\n\nbrought   by     plaintiffs    InvesSys,     Inc.    (\"InvesSys\"),    and   Peter\n\nHodges.    One of the claims in the complaint was for copyright\n\ninfringement and, at the end of the case, the district court\n\nawarded   attorney's     fees    and   costs    to    McGraw-Hill     under    the\n\nCopyright Act.       17 U.S.C. § 505 (2000).           Plaintiffs now appeal,\n\ncontesting the award.\n\n           The background facts are as follows.             During the spring\n\nof 2000, McGraw-Hill became interested in selling a subsidiary\n\ncalled Micropal Accounting Portfolio Services, Inc. (\"MAPSI\").\n\nMAPSI's primary      business    was   the    licensing    and   support      of   a\n\nWindows-based software program called \"MaPS.\"              Hodges, who was an\n\nemployee of the McGraw-Hill subsidiary that owned MAPSI–Standard &\n\nPoor's    Fund     Services,    Inc.    (\"S&P\")--expressed        interest         in\n\npurchasing MAPSI.\n\n           Negotiations between Hodges and McGraw-Hill for the sale\n\nof MAPSI began in the fall of 2000.                  The lead negotiator for\n\nMcGraw-Hill was Kevin Thornton, then the managing director of S&P.\n\nAt some point in the negotiations, Hodges requested that MaPS's\n\nDOS-based predecessor programs be included in the deal.                 Thornton\n\nagreed, and, because the additional programs Hodges sought were\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fconsidered obsolete, directed that they be added to the terms of a\n\ndraft sales agreement for no additional consideration.\n\n            When      McGraw-Hill's   lawyer    (Susan     Winter)   added   the\n\npredecessor programs to the draft agreement, she also included a\n\nprogram called \"AIM,\" which was not obsolete, was not a part of the\n\nMaPS line of programs, and in fact generated millions of dollars in\n\nrevenue for McGraw-Hill.1       Hodges had expressed interest in the AIM\n\nprogram to McGraw-Hill manager Adrian Manning, who had referred\n\nHodges to Thornton.        Hodges would later claim that he spoke with\n\nThornton about AIM and obtained his agreement to include the\n\nprogram    in   the    deal;   Thornton     would   deny    that   Hodges    ever\n\napproached him about AIM.\n\n            The draft agreement--including its reference to the AIM\n\nprogram--was reviewed several times by Thornton and other McGraw-\n\nHill officials before it was executed by the parties on May 29,\n\n2001.     The final purchase price was $19,600, and no McGraw-Hill\n\nofficial raised any objection to the specification of the AIM\n\nprogram as among those being transferred.                  After the sale was\n\ncompleted, Hodges conveyed his rights to MAPSI and AIM to InvesSys.\n\n\n     1\n      Both MaPS and AIM were performance-measurement tools, but\nthey performed different functions and used different information.\nMaPS was a management and accounting system that was designed\nprimarily to allow users to keep track of a portfolio of fixed\nincome investments through the periodic entry of data, such as the\nprice at which a particular security was acquired. By contrast,\nAIM allowed users to analyze and compare data (separately supplied\nby S&P) relating to some 60,000 mutual funds worldwide. The two\nprograms were marketed and supported separately.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fHodges is InvesSys's sole shareholder, sole officer, sole director,\n\nand sole employee.\n\n          On August 2, 2002, Hodges called Thornton to arrange a\n\nmeeting for the following day.           At the meeting, Hodges asked\n\nThornton for access to data feeds that were necessary to market the\n\nAIM software.   Thornton claimed that he had not been aware that AIM\n\nhad been included in the terms of the sales agreement.               After\n\nexamination of the document, McGraw-Hill took the position that,\n\nunder New York law, inclusion of AIM was a scrivener's error and\n\nmaintained that it still owned the rights to AIM.\n\n          On November 26, 2001, Hodges and InvesSys filed suit\n\nagainst McGraw-Hill in the federal district court for the district\n\nof Massachusetts.       The suit alleged copyright infringement--a\n\nfederal claim   under    the   Copyright   Act--as   well   as   breach   of\n\ncontract and a medley of other state law claims (fraud, conversion,\n\nand claims under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A).           Because the parties\n\nagreed that the scrivener's-error issue was central, the district\n\ncourt directed that only the state law claims proceed to trial, the\n\ncopyright claim being held in abeyance.\n\n          At trial, the principal witnesses were Hodges, Winter,\n\nManning, and Thornton. The gist of plaintiffs' case was that there\n\nhad been a knowing sale of AIM by McGraw-Hill; defendants' position\n\nwas that inclusion of AIM was patently a scrivener's error by\n\nWinter and that the parties' true intentions required reform of the\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fcontract to exclude AIM under well established legal doctrine. See\n\nGeorge Backer Mgmt. Corp. v. ACME Quilting Co., 385 N.E.2d 1062,\n\n1066 (N.Y. 1978); 7 Corbin on Contracts § 2845 (rev. ed. 2002).\n\n           After the close of evidence, the court presented the jury\n\nwith a single initial question:\n\n           Have the defendants proven by clear and\n           convincing evidence, that the inclusion of\n           'AIM' in . . . the Share Purchase Agreement\n           was a scrivener's error that did not reflect\n           the actual agreement of the parties?\n\nThe jury answered \"yes,\" and the district court entered judgment\n\nfor McGraw-Hill on all claims, including the claim of copyright\n\ninfringement.    Thereafter, the court awarded McGraw-Hill $200,000\n\nin attorney's fees and $28,583.78 in costs under section 505,\n\nfinding   that   plaintiffs'   claim   of   copyright   infringement   was\n\nobjectively unreasonable and improperly motivated.\n\n           In its award, the district court declined to make any\n\nreduction despite plaintiffs' claim (and defendants' admission)\n\nthat much, if not all, of the legal work performed in the case had\n\napplication to the state law claims as well as the copyright claim.\n\nThe district court included in its award payments by defense\n\ncounsel for computer-assisted legal research.       The court also made\n\nthe award run against Hodges personally as well as InvesSys.\n\nPlaintiffs now appeal, challenging the award itself and each of the\n\nancillary rulings.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f          Section 505 provides:\n\n          In any civil action under this title, the\n          court in its discretion may allow the recovery\n          of full costs by or against any party other\n          than the United States or an officer thereof.\n          Except as otherwise provided by this title,\n          the court may also award a reasonable\n          attorney's fee to the prevailing party as part\n          of the costs.\n\n          Unlike most fee-shifting statutes, section 505 allows\n\nattorney's fees to be awarded to defendants on an \"even-handed\"\n\nbasis with plaintiffs. Fogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517, 534\n\n(1994); Lotus Dev. Corp. v. Borland Int'l, Inc., 140 F.3d 70, 72-73\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).      Fogerty said that the award rested in \"the\n\n[trial] court's discretion\" and that there was no formula, but that\n\nfactors that could be taken into consideration included inter alia\n\nthe objective unreasonableness of the losing side's position.      510\n\nU.S. at 534 & n.19.\n\n          Although fee awards are nominally reviewed on appeal for\n\n\"abuse of discretion,\" Matthews v. Freedman, 157 F.3d 25, 29 (1st\n\nCir. 1998), an award can also depend on legal issues that are\n\nreviewed de novo.   See United States v. Padilla-Galarza, 351 F.3d\n\n594, 597 & n.3 (1st Cir. 2003).         Plaintiffs' broadest position,\n\nwhich falls in the latter category, is that no award was permitted\n\nbecause the trial was directed only to state law claims and turned\n\non a state law issue; at the very least, say plaintiffs, the costs\n\nhad to be allocated and that most concerned the ownership issue\n\nrather than anything peculiar to copyright.\n\n                                  -6-\n\f          The statute, drafted with claims under the Copyright Act\n\nin mind, does not expressly address the problem of a case with a\n\nmix of claims.    However, here a federal copyright claim was\n\nasserted in the complaint, so this is literally a \"civil action\n\nunder this title [the Copyright Act],\" 17 U.S.C. § 505; and the\n\ncase law has used common sense to carry out Congress' underlying\n\nintent to provide for attorney's fees in copyright enforcement or\n\nlike matters but not for other civil claims that do not involve\n\ncopyright.   See Entm't Research Group, Inc. v. Genesis Creative\n\nGroup, Inc., 122 F.3d 1211, 1230-31 (9th Cir. 1997), cert. denied,\n\n523 U.S. 1021 (1998).\n\n          Implementing that intent presents the recurring problem\n\nof form versus substance.   The only claims posed for trial were\n\nstate law claims (most importantly, a contract claim) and the only\n\nissue decided was ownership of AIM, turning on state law rules as\n\nto contract and reformation.      Ownership of a copyright is a\n\npredicate to a federal copyright claim, see 17 U.S.C. § 501(b);\n\nFeist Publ'ns, Inc. v. Rural Tel. Serv. Co., 499 U.S. 340, 361\n\n(1991), but the rules governing contractual transfer of ownership\n\nhave been left (for the most part) to state law.2\n\n\n\n     2\n      See, e.g., Walthal v. Rusk, 172 F.3d 481, 485 (7th Cir.\n1999); 1 Nimmer on Copyright § 101(B)(3)(a) (2003) (\"[I]t remains\ntrue that the vast bulk of copyright contractual issues must be\nresolved under state law, given the silence of the Copyright Act in\naddressing such issues as . . . how to construe ambiguous\ncontractual language . . . .\").\n\n                               -7-\n\f             Yet the question of ownership of AIM was common to both\n\nthe plaintiffs' claim under the Copyright Act and their claims\n\nunder state law.     If plaintiffs lost as to ownership, all claims\n\nfailed.      The fact that the district court chose to extract this\n\ncommon issue and try it first, nominally deferring the copyright\n\nclaim, does not alter the fact that the copyright claim was in the\n\ncase   and    depended   on   the   ownership   issue   being   tried.   Had\n\nplaintiffs' complaint set forth only the copyright claim, exactly\n\nthe same contractual issue would have had to be tried.\n\n             Had plaintiffs never asserted a copyright claim but only\n\nclaims under state law, it would be hard to describe this as a\n\n\"civil action under\" that statute.           But here a copyright claim was\n\nmade, thereby permitting Copyright Act remedies, and the issue\n\nactually litigated was necessary to the assertion of that claim.\n\nSo it serves Congress' purpose to compensate the winning side for\n\nattorney's fees and costs.          C.f. Maljack Prods., Inc. v. Goodtimes\n\nHome Video Corp., 81 F.3d 881, 884-86, 889 (9th Cir. 1996).\n\n             Plaintiffs argue that because the ownership issue is\n\ngoverned by state law, it cannot carry out \"the purposes\" of the\n\nCopyright Act to award attorney's fees and costs.          We think this is\n\ntoo cramped a reading of the statute.           On the contrary, in section\n\n505 Congress aimed to provide a potential incentive to the winner\n\nwho asserts a successful copyright claim or defends against an\n\nunworthy one.     This practical concern is present whether the case\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fhappens to decide a landmark issue of copyright law or, in the end,\n\nturns on matters that have nothing to do with the statute.\n\n             Consider that a copyright case may turn solely on a\n\nquestion of fact such as whether the defendant copied a protected\n\nwork or stumbled on the same jingle by chance.          Or a copyright case\n\nmight be won because the defendant failed to answer the complaint\n\nor be lost because of a discovery violation by the plaintiff--civil\n\nprocedure questions in which copyright law plays no part.               Yet in\n\nboth sets of cases, surely the winner could claim attorney's fees\n\nand costs (subject as always to the trial court's discretionary\n\njudgment).     See McGaughey v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 12\n\nF.3d 62, 64-65 (5th Cir. 1994).\n\n             Plaintiffs also argue that, at a minimum, there should\n\nhave been an allocation of fees and costs between the copyright and\n\nstate law claims.      If there were any indication that significant\n\nextra moneys were expended by the defense because of the presence\n\nof state law claims, we would agree that allocation was required.\n\nSee Entm't Research Group, 122 F.3d at 1230.           That could easily be\n\nso if, for example, independent issues were raised and litigated as\n\nto fraud that were unnecessary to resolving the ownership issue.\n\n             Plaintiffs claim that such unrelated issues were raised\n\nin the district court and that the district court erred by failing\n\nto reduce the award to reflect work done on them.                Specifically,\n\nplaintiffs    say   that   the   parties   disagreed   as   to    whether   the\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fplaintiffs would be able to establish \"benefit of the bargain\"\n\ndamages on their contract claim and whether such damages were\n\nlimited to the amount of the purchase price by the terms of the\n\ncontract.     All indications are that these were minor points; but,\n\nin any event, the plaintiffs did not make this argument before the\n\ndistrict court so it is forfeited.           Daigle v. Maine Med. Ctr.,\n\nInc., 14 F.3d 684, 687 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n              Plaintiffs next say that the ownership claim was a\n\nreasonable one and that the district court should therefore have\n\nnot awarded attorney's fees.         Section 505, quoted in full above,\n\nsays that the district court \"in its discretion may allow the\n\nrecovery of full costs\" including an attorney's fee.               Under the\n\ncase law, dishonesty is not required for an award; even a case that\n\nis   merely    objectively   quite   weak   can   warrant   such   an   award.\n\nMatthews, 157 F.3d at 29.\n\n              This case is perhaps unusual because at first blush it\n\nmight appear as if the plaintiffs had a colorable claim that Hodges\n\nhad purchased, and InvesSys now owned, the AIM copyright.                 The\n\nclear language of the written contract, presumed to reflect the\n\nparties' intent, explicitly included AIM, and McGraw-Hill obviously\n\nexhibited remarkable negligence in failing to detect the apparent\n\nerror despite its officials' review of the written contract.\n\nFurther, under the applicable New York law, McGraw-Hill had a\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fheightened burden to prove the error by clear and convincing\n\nevidence.\n\n             Nevertheless, the closer one looks at the circumstances,\n\nthe   more   dubious     plaintiffs'    ownership    claim    appears.       Most\n\nimportant is the underlying transaction related to MaPS, which was\n\npurchased for a quite modest sum just under $20,000. The DOS-based\n\npredecessor programs were added at Hodges' request after the\n\noriginal bargaining and at no additional cost.                 AIM was not a\n\npredecessor       program,      was    not    part    of     MaPS    and--most\n\nsignificantly–was generating about $3-4 million per year.                    Even\n\nthough there was evidence that McGraw-Hill was planning to replace\n\nAIM reasonably soon, the idea that it deliberately intended to\n\ntransfer     a   program   then   generating    millions      for   nothing    is\n\nperverse.\n\n             Still, it might well have made the case arguable if there\n\nhad been substantial negotiations about the transfer of the AIM\n\nprogram.         Yet,   while   McGraw-Hill    admitted      that   Hodges    had\n\napproached Manning about the subject and had been told to take it\n\nup with Thornton, Thornton testified at trial that he had not\n\noffered AIM to Hodges; Hodges said that there was discussion and a\n\ndeal.      It is a fair inference, from both the result and the\n\nsurrounding circumstances, that the jury and the trial judge both\n\ncredited Thornton's version of events over Hodges'.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f           There were other circumstances supporting McGraw-Hill's\n\nposition. The evidence did not show that a launch date for McGraw-\n\nHill's supposed successor system was so clearly imminent that AIM\n\nwas going to be obsolete in McGraw-Hill's hands at the time of\n\nHodges' alleged purchase of AIM, nor did the contract contain any\n\nprovision by which Hodges licensed AIM back to McGraw-Hill so that\n\nit could continue, for the present, to service its current AIM\n\nclients.   It is difficult to believe that McGraw-Hill would have\n\nsold an essential component of a multi-million dollar business\n\nwithout such a license back.\n\n           Of course, in determining whether to award attorney's\n\nfees, the district court's judgment as to the reasonableness of the\n\noriginal claim had to rest on what Hodges knew when he made and\n\npressed his claim and not merely on the unfavorable outcome.   Cf.\n\nTang v. State of R.I., Dep't of Elderly Affairs, 163 F.3d 7, 13\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).   But in this case, Hodges certainly knew at the\n\noutset of the raw facts supporting McGraw-Hill's position (e.g.,\n\nthe disparity between price and value) and also knew in fact\n\nwhether he had had any detailed negotiations with Thornton about\n\nwhether AIM should be included in the deal.\n\n           So long as the district court correctly stated the legal\n\nstandard or criteria, review of the award is only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    Matthews, 157 F.3d at 29; cf. Lotus Dev. Corp., 140\n\nF.3d at 72.   Plaintiffs complain that the district court did not\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fseriously consider the plaintiffs' own evidence in support of the\n\nclaim; but the district court, having sat through the trial, was\n\nfully familiar with the background and the direct testimony of\n\nHodges and Thornton. We have no basis for overturning the district\n\ncourt's decision that an award was appropriate.\n\n          We turn next to one disputed item in the award.       The\n\ndistrict court allowed recovery under section 505 of the costs of\n\nlegal research done using one of the standard services (Westlaw;\n\nLexis).   Plaintiffs have not preserved any claim that the amount\n\nwas excessive or that research was not needed.    Rather, they urge\n\n(as they did unsuccessfully in the district court) that such a cost\n\nshould be treated as part of law firm overhead (covered by the\n\nfirm’s hourly fee) rather than as a separately reimbursable item.\n\n          This is an issue on which the courts have been divided;3\n\nand, given the ubiquity of computer-aided research in law practice,\n\nthe issue deserves our full attention.   Section 505, taken alone,\n\nis not illuminating: it says only that the court may allow the\n\n\n\n     3\n      Compare, e.g., Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v. Mutual Trading\nCorp., 63 F.3d 516, 526 (7th Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 516 U.S.\n1115 (1996) (holding that expenses paid for computer-assisted\nresearch were recoverable), and United Nuclear Corp. v. Cannon, 564\nF. Supp. 2d 581, 591-92 (D.R.I. 1983) (Selya, J.) (same), with,\ne.g., Standley v. Chilhowee R-IV Sch. Dist., 5 F.3d 319, 325 & n.7\n(8th Cir. 1993) (holding that the cost of computerized research\nmust be factored into attorneys' hourly rates and is not separately\ncompensable), BD v. Debuono, 177 F.

Mass. 2001) (same).\n\n                               -13-\n\fprevailing     party   “full   costs”      and    may   award   “a    reasonable\n\nattorney’s fee to the prevailing party as part of the costs.”                  17\n\nU.S.C. § 505.    There is no reason to think that Congress gave any\n\nparticular thought to computer-aided research.\n\n            Although section 505's “full costs” language could be\n\ndistinguished from more familiar and slightly narrower wording in\n\nother fee shifting statutes, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1988 (2000) (\"the\n\ncourt, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a\n\nreasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs\"), the tendency of\n\nthe courts has been to treat most statutes similarly whether in\n\nallowing or disallowing particular items.               The starting point in\n\nmany cases–-and the ending point in some-–is that another federal\n\nstatute specifies various taxable “costs” (e.g., \"[f]ees of the\n\nclerk and marshal\" and \"[f]ees and disbursements for printing and\n\nwitnesses\"),    but    the   list   does    not   include   computer-assisted\n\nresearch.    28 U.S.C. § 1920 (2000); Yasui v. Maui Elec. Co., 78 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 1124, 1129-30 (D. Haw. 1999).\n\n            Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has endorsed the view\n\nthat disbursements made by an attorney and ordinarily billed\n\ndirectly to the client (that is, separately from the hourly or\n\nfixed   fee)    can    properly     be   encompassed      within     the   phrase\n\n“attorney’s fee,” see W. Va. Univ. Hosps., Inc. v. Casey, 499 U.S.\n\n83, 87 n.3 (1991); and it is not uncommon for courts to allow such\n\ncosts as travel, long distance calls, and parking on top of the\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\fhourly fee.     E.g., Downes v. Volkswagen of Am., Inc., 41 F.3d 1132,\n\n1144 (7th Cir. 1994); Data Gen. Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support\n\nCorp., 825 F. Supp. 361, 367-68 (D. Mass. 1993).\n\n          In our view, computer-assisted research should be treated\n\nsimilarly and reimbursed under attorney’s fee statutes like section\n\n505, so long as the research cost is in fact paid by the firm to a\n\nthird-party provider and is customarily charged by the firm to its\n\nclients as a separate disbursement.            If it saves attorney time to\n\ndo research this way, probably the hours billed are fewer, Haroco,\n\nInc. v. Am. Nat'l Bank & Trust Co., 38 F.3d 1429, 1440-41 (7th Cir.\n\n1994); and in any event Westlaw and Lexis are now as much part of\n\nlegal service as a lawyer's taxi to the courthouse.\n\n          Courts that have resisted reimbursement of computer-\n\nassisted research as part of attorney’s fees have asked why that\n\ncost   should    be   distinguished     from    the     law   firm’s   cost    of\n\nmaintaining its law book library–-a cost that is customarily\n\ntreated as overhead to be covered by the hourly or other fee rather\n\nthan billed as a disbursement.         E.g., Debuono, 177 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n209.    Some    courts   may   also    think    that,    as   the   hourly    fee\n\ngenerically covers “legal research,” there is a taint of double\n\nbilling in charging separately for Westlaw or Lexis.                See Scanlon\n\nv. Kessler, 23 F. Supp. 2d 413, 418 (S.D.N.Y. 1998).\n\n          The answer to these concerns has something to do with\n\neconomics but also with history and record-keeping practice.                  As\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fconfigured by the provider, computer-aided research is often a\n\nvariable cost in an individual case–-that is, the cost varies (from\n\nzero upward) depending on the amount of Westlaw or Lexis service\n\nused in the case.   By contrast, the firm pays no more or less for\n\nits library books, regardless of whether they are pulled off the\n\nshelf for a given law suit, so it is described as a fixed rather\n\nthan a variable cost.\n\n          In professional legal services, variable costs that are\n\nboth large and easily assigned–-especially those paid directly to\n\nthird-party vendors--tend often to be separately billed to the\n\nclient; those not so easily assigned or inconvenient to track are\n\ncovered by the hourly fee.4   Separate billing does not mean double\n\nbilling: the computer services directly paid to Lexis or Westlaw do\n\nnot reappear in some concealed form as part of the hourly rate.\n\nIndeed, if such services were treated as overhead, the hourly rate\n\nwould likely be higher.\n\n          It is common knowledge that large law firms regularly\n\ntrack computer-assisted research costs “by client” (both Westlaw\n\nand Lexis make this easy) and then bill clients directly for those\n\n\n\n     4\n      In economics, there are efficiency arguments for collecting\nvariable costs from the cost causer–“efficiency” meaning that\nresources will be used more productively.        Cf. 1 Kahn, The\nEconomics of Regulation: Principles and Institutions 71-72 (1970).\nBut it is impractical to track and collect all variable costs\n(e.g., yellow pads used by each lawyer), and anyway the hourly fee\nis a crude proxy for many variable costs (the more hours spent, the\nmore yellow pads used–-roughly speaking).\n\n                                -16-\n\fcosts.    See, e.g., Case v. United Sch. Dist. No. 233, 157 F.3d\n\n1243, 1257-58 (10th Cir. 1998); Crosby v. Bowater Inc. Ret. Plan\n\nfor Salaried Employees of Great N. Paper, Inc., 262 F. Supp. 2d\n\n804, 817 (W.D. Mich. 2003).      The practice being so, we see no\n\nreason why such costs–-if paid to third-party providers--should not\n\nbe recovered under section 505.    In sum, we align ourselves with\n\nthe courts that have allowed computer-assisted research costs to be\n\nrecovered as a separate item.5\n\n           The final claim on appeal, made only by Hodges, is that\n\nhe did not personally claim ownership of the AIM copyright, so he\n\npersonally should not have been held liable by the district court\n\nfor fees and costs imposed under that section. McGraw-Hill defends\n\nthe district court’s award against Hodges as well as InvesSys, but\n\nadmits that it has little at stake as to Hodges’ personal liability\n\nbecause full recovery by it is assured by the appeal bond covering\n\nboth plaintiffs.     Still, the issue of Hodges' liability is not\n\nmoot:    under the judgment, McGraw-Hill is free to collect against\n\nHodges personally.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      A different problem would be presented if the firm paid a\nflat monthly fee to Westlaw or Lexis and then allocated amounts\namong clients; similarly, any markup by the firm would raise\nquestions. However, the plaintiffs in this case did not make any\nsuch claim in the district court, and we take the defendants' brief\nto assert that the costs in question were simply a straight pass-\nthrough of time-based charges paid to the service providers for\nwork done in this case.\n\n                                 -17-\n\f            Hodges' argument rests on the proposition that only the\n\nowner of a copyright may sue for infringement under the Copyright\n\nAct, and, because Hodges had previously transferred any ownership\n\ninterest he had in AIM to his corporation, he therefore could not\n\nproperly claim under the Copyright Act but only under state law\n\n(e.g., for fraud or breach of contract).        This might be beside the\n\npoint if Hodges had in this case purported to claim under the\n\nCopyright   Act,   but   in   this   instance   the   complaint--although\n\nsomewhat ambiguous--suggests that only InvesSys was claiming under\n\nthe Copyright Act.\n\n             The statute says that the court may allow “full costs”\n\n“against any party” (other than the government or its officers) and\n\nthat this may include attorney’s fees in favor of the prevailing\n\nparty.   17 U.S.C. § 505.     At first blush one might think that this\n\ngives the district court carte blanche to award attorney’s fees\n\nagainst anyone on the losing side as to any claim “in any civil\n\naction under” the Copyright Act–-the subject matter with which\n\nsection 505 deals--but this is surely too broad a reading.\n\n            A civil action in which a federal copyright claim is\n\nasserted arises “under” the Copyright Act, see T.B. Harms Co. v.\n\nEliscu, 339 F.2d 823, 828-29 (2d Cir. 1964), cert. denied, 381 U.S.\n\n915 (1965), regardless of whether non-copyright claims are asserted\n\nas well.    Yet, Congress’ obvious concern in section 505 was in\n\nfacilitating the assertion and defense of copyright claims-–not\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fother kinds of claims.         Cf. Entm't Research Group, 122 F.3d at\n\n1230, 1232; Yankee Candle, 140 F. Supp. 2d at 122-23.\n\n            This is why courts implementing section 505 tend almost\n\nautomatically    to    allocate    attorney’s    fees    and   costs    between\n\ncopyright and non-copyright claims where this can feasibly be done,\n\nlimiting recovery to costs causally associated with the copyright\n\nclaim.    E.g., Yankee Candle, 140 F. Supp. 2d at 122-123.          There was\n\nno apportionment here only because the litigated issue was common\n\nto both copyright and non-copyright claims, so the same costs would\n\nhave been incurred for the former alone.\n\n            The same apportionment philosophy ought presumptively to\n\nguide liability as among parties.           If Hodges had no association\n\nwith the copyright claim but were a party to the case for unrelated\n\nreasons,    an award of attorney’s fees against Hodges under section\n\n505 would be improper even though McGraw-Hill would still have\n\nprevailed against InvesSys in an action “under” the Copyright Act.\n\nSuch a situation is not that difficult to imagine, given that\n\nfederal joinder rules tend to be generous as to both parties and\n\nclaims.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 18, 20.\n\n            However,    this      does   not    mean    that   Hodges    ought\n\nautomatically be exempted from liability merely because he is not\n\nproperly a claimant under the Copyright Act and did not explicitly\n\nassert such a copyright claim in the complaint.            In this instance,\n\nHodges was a party to the complaint but not only that:                  he was\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fintimately involved in the transaction allegedly giving rise to the\n\ncopyright claim, owned the company asserting the claim, was a key\n\nwitness in fostering the claim in this case, and stood to benefit\n\nsubstantially if the imposture had succeeded.\n\n          Under such circumstances, we think that section 505's\n\npolicy, as well as its language, permits the award to run against\n\nHodges as well as against InvesSys. Hughes v. Novi American, Inc.,\n\n724 F.2d 122, 126 (Fed. Cir. 1984), may lend a measure of support\n\nto this view; in any event, nothing flatly to the contrary has been\n\ncited to us.   Hodges was peculiarly responsible for this copyright\n\nclaim on several different levels and was a party to that case and\n\nthe deterrence policy of the statute well fits his conduct.   That\n\nis enough for this case.    Future decisions will have to mark out\n\nthe boundary as new fact situations present themselves.\n\n          There are certainly arguments for a flat rule that only\n\na losing party formally on one side of a copyright claim can be\n\nheld liable for costs under section 505.      It would be easy to\n\nadminister and avoid possible asymmetries; if Hodges had not been\n\na party then (veil piercing aside) he would not be liable even\n\nthough equally \"responsible\" for the claim.   But such a mechanical\n\napproach would also be a judicial creation, since the statute's\n\nlanguage imposes no such flat rule; and it would be less responsive\n\nto the underlying policies.   Imagine that there had been no appeal\n\nbond and InvesSys had no assets of its own.\n\n\n                                -20-\n\f          This   case   was   well   handled   and   properly   decided.\n\nHowever, whatever fault can be imputed to the plaintiffs for making\n\nthe claim, all but one of the issues raised on appeal presented\n\nserious legal questions, and the appeal was legitimately pursued.\n\nWe have no inclination to make a separate award of attorney’s fees\n\nto McGraw-Hill for work done on the appeal, although the usual\n\naward of statutory costs is allowed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f",

Defendants--The       McGraw-Hill\n\nCompanies, Ltd., and The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. (together\n\n\"McGraw-Hill\")--successfully defended themselves against a lawsuit\n\nbrought   by     plaintiffs    InvesSys,     Inc.    (\"InvesSys\"),    and   Peter\n\nHodges.    One of the claims in the complaint was for copyright\n\ninfringement and, at the end of the case, the district court\n\nawarded   attorney's     fees    and   costs    to    McGraw-Hill     under    the\n\nCopyright Act.       17 U.S.C. § 505 (2000).           Plaintiffs now appeal,\n\ncontesting the award.\n\n           The background facts are as follows.             During the spring\n\nof 2000, McGraw-Hill became interested in selling a subsidiary\n\ncalled Micropal Accounting Portfolio Services, Inc. (\"MAPSI\").\n\nMAPSI's primary      business    was   the    licensing    and   support      of   a\n\nWindows-based software program called \"MaPS.\"              Hodges, who was an\n\nemployee of the McGraw-Hill subsidiary that owned MAPSI–Standard &\n\nPoor's    Fund     Services,    Inc.    (\"S&P\")--expressed        interest         in\n\npurchasing MAPSI.\n\n           Negotiations between Hodges and McGraw-Hill for the sale\n\nof MAPSI began in the fall of 2000.                  The lead negotiator for\n\nMcGraw-Hill was Kevin Thornton, then the managing director of S&P.\n\nAt some point in the negotiations, Hodges requested that MaPS's\n\nDOS-based predecessor programs be included in the deal.                 Thornton\n\nagreed, and, because the additional programs Hodges sought were\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fconsidered obsolete, directed that they be added to the terms of a\n\ndraft sales agreement for no additional consideration.\n\n            When      McGraw-Hill's   lawyer    (Susan     Winter)   added   the\n\npredecessor programs to the draft agreement, she also included a\n\nprogram called \"AIM,\" which was not obsolete, was not a part of the\n\nMaPS line of programs, and in fact generated millions of dollars in\n\nrevenue for McGraw-Hill.1       Hodges had expressed interest in the AIM\n\nprogram to McGraw-Hill manager Adrian Manning, who had referred\n\nHodges to Thornton.        Hodges would later claim that he spoke with\n\nThornton about AIM and obtained his agreement to include the\n\nprogram    in   the    deal;   Thornton     would   deny    that   Hodges    ever\n\napproached him about AIM.\n\n            The draft agreement--including its reference to the AIM\n\nprogram--was reviewed several times by Thornton and other McGraw-\n\nHill officials before it was executed by the parties on May 29,\n\n2001.     The final purchase price was $19,600, and no McGraw-Hill\n\nofficial raised any objection to the specification of the AIM\n\nprogram as among those being transferred.                  After the sale was\n\ncompleted, Hodges conveyed his rights to MAPSI and AIM to InvesSys.\n\n\n     1\n      Both MaPS and AIM were performance-measurement tools, but\nthey performed different functions and used different information.\nMaPS was a management and accounting system that was designed\nprimarily to allow users to keep track of a portfolio of fixed\nincome investments through the periodic entry of data, such as the\nprice at which a particular security was acquired. By contrast,\nAIM allowed users to analyze and compare data (separately supplied\nby S&P) relating to some 60,000 mutual funds worldwide. The two\nprograms were marketed and supported separately.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fHodges is InvesSys's sole shareholder, sole officer, sole director,\n\nand sole employee.\n\n          On August 2, 2002, Hodges called Thornton to arrange a\n\nmeeting for the following day.           At the meeting, Hodges asked\n\nThornton for access to data feeds that were necessary to market the\n\nAIM software.   Thornton claimed that he had not been aware that AIM\n\nhad been included in the terms of the sales agreement.               After\n\nexamination of the document, McGraw-Hill took the position that,\n\nunder New York law, inclusion of AIM was a scrivener's error and\n\nmaintained that it still owned the rights to AIM.\n\n          On November 26, 2001, Hodges and InvesSys filed suit\n\nagainst McGraw-Hill in the federal district court for the district\n\nof Massachusetts.       The suit alleged copyright infringement--a\n\nfederal claim   under    the   Copyright   Act--as   well   as   breach   of\n\ncontract and a medley of other state law claims (fraud, conversion,\n\nand claims under Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A).           Because the parties\n\nagreed that the scrivener's-error issue was central, the district\n\ncourt directed that only the state law claims proceed to trial, the\n\ncopyright claim being held in abeyance.\n\n          At trial, the principal witnesses were Hodges, Winter,\n\nManning, and Thornton. The gist of plaintiffs' case was that there\n\nhad been a knowing sale of AIM by McGraw-Hill; defendants' position\n\nwas that inclusion of AIM was patently a scrivener's error by\n\nWinter and that the parties' true intentions required reform of the\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fcontract to exclude AIM under well established legal doctrine.

Thereafter, the court awarded McGraw-Hill $200,000\n\nin attorney's fees and $28,583.78 in costs under section 505,\n\nfinding   that   plaintiffs'   claim   of   copyright   infringement   was\n\nobjectively unreasonable and improperly motivated.\n\n           In its award, the district court declined to make any\n\nreduction despite plaintiffs' claim (and defendants' admission)\n\nthat much, if not all, of the legal work performed in the case had\n\napplication to the state law claims as well as the copyright claim.\n\nThe district court included in its award payments by defense\n\ncounsel for computer-assisted legal research.

Plaintiffs' broadest position,\n\nwhich falls in the latter category, is that no award was permitted\n\nbecause the trial was directed only to state law claims and turned\n\non a state law issue; at the very least, say plaintiffs, the costs\n\nhad to be allocated and that most concerned the ownership issue\n\nrather than anything peculiar to copyright.\n\n                                  -6-\n\f          The statute, drafted with claims under the Copyright Act\n\nin mind, does not expressly address the problem of a case with a\n\nmix of claims.    However, here a federal copyright claim was\n\nasserted in the complaint, so this is literally a \"civil action\n\nunder this title [the Copyright Act],\" 17 U.S.C. § 505; and the\n\ncase law has used common sense to carry out Congress' underlying\n\nintent to provide for attorney's fees in copyright enforcement or\n\nlike matters but not for other civil claims that do not involve\n\ncopyright.

If plaintiffs lost as to ownership, all claims\n\nfailed.      The fact that the district court chose to extract this\n\ncommon issue and try it first, nominally deferring the copyright\n\nclaim, does not alter the fact that the copyright claim was in the\n\ncase   and    depended   on   the   ownership   issue   being   tried.

We think this is\n\ntoo cramped a reading of the statute.           On the contrary, in section\n\n505 Congress aimed to provide a potential incentive to the winner\n\nwho asserts a successful copyright claim or defends against an\n\nunworthy one.     This practical concern is present whether the case\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fhappens to decide a landmark issue of copyright law or, in the end,\n\nturns on matters that have nothing to do with the statute.\n\n             Consider that a copyright case may turn solely on a\n\nquestion of fact such as whether the defendant copied a protected\n\nwork or stumbled on the same jingle by chance.          Or a copyright case\n\nmight be won because the defendant failed to answer the complaint\n\nor be lost because of a discovery violation by the plaintiff--civil\n\nprocedure questions in which copyright law plays no part.               Yet in\n\nboth sets of cases, surely the winner could claim attorney's fees\n\nand costs (subject as always to the trial court's discretionary\n\njudgment).     See McGaughey v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"6215\"><a href=\"/opinion/6215/mcgaughey-v-twentieth-century-fox-film-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 64-65 (5th Cir. 1994).\n\n             Plaintiffs also argue that, at a minimum, there should\n\nhave been an allocation of fees and costs between the copyright and\n\nstate law claims.      If there were any indication that significant\n\nextra moneys were expended by the defense because of the presence\n\nof state law claims, we would agree that allocation was required.\n\nSee Entm't Research Group, 122 F.3d at 1230.           That could easily be\n\nso if, for example, independent issues were raised and litigated as\n\nto fraud that were unnecessary to resolving the ownership issue.\n\n             Plaintiffs claim that such unrelated issues were raised\n\nin the district court and that the district court erred by failing\n\nto reduce the award to reflect work done on them.                Specifically,\n\nplaintiffs    say   that   the   parties   disagreed   as   to    whether   the\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fplaintiffs would be able to establish \"benefit of the bargain\"\n\ndamages on their contract claim and whether such damages were\n\nlimited to the amount of the purchase price by the terms of the\n\ncontract.     All indications are that these were minor points; but,\n\nin any event, the plaintiffs did not make this argument before the\n\ndistrict court so it is forfeited.           Daigle v. Maine Med. Ctr.,\n\nInc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195171\"><a href=\"/opinion/195171/daigle-v-maine-medical/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 687 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n              Plaintiffs next say that the ownership claim was a\n\nreasonable one and that the district court should therefore have\n\nnot awarded attorney's fees.         Section 505, quoted in full above,\n\nsays that the district court \"in its discretion may allow the\n\nrecovery of full costs\" including an attorney's fee.               Under the\n\ncase law, dishonesty is not required for an award; even a case that\n\nis   merely    objectively   quite   weak   can   warrant   such   an   award.\n\nMatthews, 157 F.3d at 29.\n\n              This case is perhaps unusual because at first blush it\n\nmight appear as if the plaintiffs had a colorable claim that Hodges\n\nhad purchased, and InvesSys now owned, the AIM copyright.                 The\n\nclear language of the written contract, presumed to reflect the\n\nparties' intent, explicitly included AIM, and McGraw-Hill obviously\n\nexhibited remarkable negligence in failing to detect the apparent\n\nerror despite its officials' review of the written contract.\n\nFurther, under the applicable New York law, McGraw-Hill had a\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fheightened burden to prove the error by clear and convincing\n\nevidence.\n\n             Nevertheless, the closer one looks at the circumstances,\n\nthe   more   dubious     plaintiffs'    ownership    claim    appears.       Most\n\nimportant is the underlying transaction related to MaPS, which was\n\npurchased for a quite modest sum just under $20,000. The DOS-based\n\npredecessor programs were added at Hodges' request after the\n\noriginal bargaining and at no additional cost.                 AIM was not a\n\npredecessor       program,      was    not    part    of     MaPS    and--most\n\nsignificantly–was generating about $3-4 million per year.                    Even\n\nthough there was evidence that McGraw-Hill was planning to replace\n\nAIM reasonably soon, the idea that it deliberately intended to\n\ntransfer     a   program   then   generating    millions      for   nothing    is\n\nperverse.\n\n             Still, it might well have made the case arguable if there\n\nhad been substantial negotiations about the transfer of the AIM\n\nprogram.         Yet,   while   McGraw-Hill    admitted      that   Hodges    had\n\napproached Manning about the subject and had been told to take it\n\nup with Thornton, Thornton testified at trial that he had not\n\noffered AIM to Hodges; Hodges said that there was discussion and a\n\ndeal.      It is a fair inference, from both the result and the\n\nsurrounding circumstances, that the jury and the trial judge both\n\ncredited Thornton's version of events over Hodges'.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f           There were other circumstances supporting McGraw-Hill's\n\nposition. The evidence did not show that a launch date for McGraw-\n\nHill's supposed successor system was so clearly imminent that AIM\n\nwas going to be obsolete in McGraw-Hill's hands at the time of\n\nHodges' alleged purchase of AIM, nor did the contract contain any\n\nprovision by which Hodges licensed AIM back to McGraw-Hill so that\n\nit could continue, for the present, to service its current AIM\n\nclients.   It is difficult to believe that McGraw-Hill would have\n\nsold an essential component of a multi-million dollar business\n\nwithout such a license back.\n\n           Of course, in determining whether to award attorney's\n\nfees, the district court's judgment as to the reasonableness of the\n\noriginal claim had to rest on what Hodges knew when he made and\n\npressed his claim and not merely on the unfavorable outcome.   Cf.\n\nTang v. State of R.I., Dep't of Elderly Affairs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198242\"><a href=\"/opinion/198242/tang-v-rhode-island/\"><span class=\"volume\">163</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13\n\n(1st Cir. 1998).   But in this case, Hodges certainly knew at the\n\noutset of the raw facts supporting McGraw-Hill's position (e.g.,\n\nthe disparity between price and value) and also knew in fact\n\nwhether he had had any detailed negotiations with Thornton about\n\nwhether AIM should be included in the deal.\n\n           So long as the district court correctly stated the legal\n\nstandard or criteria, review of the award is only for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.    Matthews, 157 F.3d at 29; cf. Lotus Dev. Corp., 140\n\nF.3d at 72.   Plaintiffs complain that the district court did not\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fseriously consider the plaintiffs' own evidence in support of the\n\nclaim; but the district court, having sat through the trial, was\n\nfully familiar with the background and the direct testimony of\n\nHodges and Thornton. We have no basis for overturning the district\n\ncourt's decision that an award was appropriate.\n\n          We turn next to one disputed item in the award.       The\n\ndistrict court allowed recovery under section 505 of the costs of\n\nlegal research done using one of the standard services (Westlaw;\n\nLexis).   Plaintiffs have not preserved any claim that the amount\n\nwas excessive or that research was not needed.    Rather, they urge\n\n(as they did unsuccessfully in the district court) that such a cost\n\nshould be treated as part of law firm overhead (covered by the\n\nfirm’s hourly fee) rather than as a separately reimbursable item.\n\n          This is an issue on which the courts have been divided;3\n\nand, given the ubiquity of computer-aided research in law practice,\n\nthe issue deserves our full attention.   Section 505, taken alone,\n\nis not illuminating: it says only that the court may allow the\n\n\n\n     3\n      Compare, e.g., Uniroyal Goodrich Tire Co. v.

There is no reason to think that Congress gave any\n\nparticular thought to computer-aided research.\n\n            Although section 505's “full costs” language could be\n\ndistinguished from more familiar and slightly narrower wording in\n\nother fee shifting statutes, e.g., 42 U.S.C. § 1988 (2000) (\"the\n\ncourt, in its discretion, may allow the prevailing party . . . a\n\nreasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs\"), the tendency of\n\nthe courts has been to treat most statutes similarly whether in\n\nallowing or disallowing particular items.               The starting point in\n\nmany cases–-and the ending point in some-–is that another federal\n\nstatute specifies various taxable “costs” (e.g., \"[f]ees of the\n\nclerk and marshal\" and \"[f]ees and disbursements for printing and\n\nwitnesses\"),    but    the   list   does    not   include   computer-assisted\n\nresearch.    28 U.S.C. § 1920 (2000); Yasui v.

As\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fconfigured by the provider, computer-aided research is often a\n\nvariable cost in an individual case–-that is, the cost varies (from\n\nzero upward) depending on the amount of Westlaw or Lexis service\n\nused in the case.   By contrast, the firm pays no more or less for\n\nits library books, regardless of whether they are pulled off the\n\nshelf for a given law suit, so it is described as a fixed rather\n\nthan a variable cost.\n\n          In professional legal services, variable costs that are\n\nboth large and easily assigned–-especially those paid directly to\n\nthird-party vendors--tend often to be separately billed to the\n\nclient; those not so easily assigned or inconvenient to track are\n\ncovered by the hourly fee.4   Separate billing does not mean double\n\nbilling: the computer services directly paid to Lexis or Westlaw do\n\nnot reappear in some concealed form as part of the hourly rate.\n\nIndeed, if such services were treated as overhead, the hourly rate\n\nwould likely be higher.\n\n          It is common knowledge that large law firms regularly\n\ntrack computer-assisted research costs “by client” (both Westlaw\n\nand Lexis make this easy) and then bill clients directly for those\n\n\n\n     4\n      In economics, there are efficiency arguments for collecting\nvariable costs from the cost causer–“efficiency” meaning that\nresources will be used more productively.        Cf. 1 Kahn, The\nEconomics of Regulation: Principles and Institutions 71-72 (1970).\nBut it is impractical to track and collect all variable costs\n(e.g., yellow pads used by each lawyer), and anyway the hourly fee\nis a crude proxy for many variable costs (the more hours spent, the\nmore yellow pads used–-roughly speaking).\n\n                                -16-\n\fcosts.

The practice being so, we see no\n\nreason why such costs–-if paid to third-party providers--should not\n\nbe recovered under section 505.    In sum, we align ourselves with\n\nthe courts that have allowed computer-assisted research costs to be\n\nrecovered as a separate item.5\n\n           The final claim on appeal, made only by Hodges, is that\n\nhe did not personally claim ownership of the AIM copyright, so he\n\npersonally should not have been held liable by the district court\n\nfor fees and costs imposed under that section. McGraw-Hill defends\n\nthe district court’s award against Hodges as well as InvesSys, but\n\nadmits that it has little at stake as to Hodges’ personal liability\n\nbecause full recovery by it is assured by the appeal bond covering\n\nboth plaintiffs.     Still, the issue of Hodges' liability is not\n\nmoot:    under the judgment, McGraw-Hill is free to collect against\n\nHodges personally.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      A different problem would be presented if the firm paid a\nflat monthly fee to Westlaw or Lexis and then allocated amounts\namong clients; similarly, any markup by the firm would raise\nquestions. However, the plaintiffs in this case did not make any\nsuch claim in the district court, and we take the defendants' brief\nto assert that the costs in question were simply a straight pass-\nthrough of time-based charges paid to the service providers for\nwork done in this case.\n\n                                 -17-\n\f            Hodges' argument rests on the proposition that only the\n\nowner of a copyright may sue for infringement under the Copyright\n\nAct, and, because Hodges had previously transferred any ownership\n\ninterest he had in AIM to his corporation, he therefore could not\n\nproperly claim under the Copyright Act but only under state law\n\n(e.g., for fraud or breach of contract).        This might be beside the\n\npoint if Hodges had in this case purported to claim under the\n\nCopyright   Act,   but   in   this   instance   the   complaint--although\n\nsomewhat ambiguous--suggests that only InvesSys was claiming under\n\nthe Copyright Act.\n\n             The statute says that the court may allow “full costs”\n\n“against any party” (other than the government or its officers) and\n\nthat this may include attorney’s fees in favor of the prevailing\n\nparty.   17 U.S.C. § 505.     At first blush one might think that this\n\ngives the district court carte blanche to award attorney’s fees\n\nagainst anyone on the losing side as to any claim “in any civil\n\naction under” the Copyright Act–-the subject matter with which\n\nsection 505 deals--but this is surely too broad a reading.\n\n            A civil action in which a federal copyright claim is\n\nasserted arises “under” the Copyright Act, see T.B. Harms Co. v.\n\nEliscu, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"266382\"><a href=\"/opinion/266382/t-b-harms-company-v-edward-eliscu-and-ross-jungnickel-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">339</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">823</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 828-29 (2d Cir. 1964), cert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">381</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">915</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1965), regardless of whether non-copyright claims are asserted\n\nas well.    Yet, Congress’ obvious concern in section 505 was in\n\nfacilitating the assertion and defense of copyright claims-–not\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fother kinds of claims.         Cf. Entm't Research Group, 122 F.3d at\n\n1230, 1232; Yankee Candle, 140 F. Supp. 2d at 122-23.\n\n            This is why courts implementing section 505 tend almost\n\nautomatically    to    allocate    attorney’s    fees    and   costs    between\n\ncopyright and non-copyright claims where this can feasibly be done,\n\nlimiting recovery to costs causally associated with the copyright\n\nclaim.    E.g., Yankee Candle, 140 F. Supp. 2d at 122-123.          There was\n\nno apportionment here only because the litigated issue was common\n\nto both copyright and non-copyright claims, so the same costs would\n\nhave been incurred for the former alone.\n\n            The same apportionment philosophy ought presumptively to\n\nguide liability as among parties.           If Hodges had no association\n\nwith the copyright claim but were a party to the case for unrelated\n\nreasons,    an award of attorney’s fees against Hodges under section\n\n505 would be improper even though McGraw-Hill would still have\n\nprevailed against InvesSys in an action “under” the Copyright Act.\n\nSuch a situation is not that difficult to imagine, given that\n\nfederal joinder rules tend to be generous as to both parties and\n\nclaims.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 18, 20.\n\n            However,    this      does   not    mean    that   Hodges    ought\n\nautomatically be exempted from liability merely because he is not\n\nproperly a claimant under the Copyright Act and did not explicitly\n\nassert such a copyright claim in the complaint.            In this instance,\n\nHodges was a party to the complaint but not only that:                  he was\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fintimately involved in the transaction allegedly giving rise to the\n\ncopyright claim, owned the company asserting the claim, was a key\n\nwitness in fostering the claim in this case, and stood to benefit\n\nsubstantially if the imposture had succeeded.\n\n          Under such circumstances, we think that section 505's\n\npolicy, as well as its language, permits the award to run against\n\nHodges as well as against InvesSys.

Novi American, Inc.,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"429313\"><a href=\"/opinion/429313/robert-f-hughes-v-novi-american-inc-oakwood-manufacturing-inc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">724</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">122</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 126 (Fed. Cir. 1984), may lend a measure of support\n\nto this view; in any event, nothing flatly to the contrary has been\n\ncited to us.   Hodges was peculiarly responsible for this copyright\n\nclaim on several different levels and was a party to that case and\n\nthe deterrence policy of the statute well fits his conduct.   That\n\nis enough for this case.    Future decisions will have to mark out\n\nthe boundary as new fact situations present themselves.\n\n          There are certainly arguments for a flat rule that only\n\na losing party formally on one side of a copyright claim can be\n\nheld liable for costs under section 505.      It would be easy to\n\nadminister and avoid possible asymmetries; if Hodges had not been\n\na party then (veil piercing aside) he would not be liable even\n\nthough equally \"responsible\" for the claim.   But such a mechanical\n\napproach would also be a judicial creation, since the statute's\n\nlanguage imposes no such flat rule; and it would be less responsive\n\nto the underlying policies.   Imagine that there had been no appeal\n\nbond and InvesSys had no assets of its own.\n\n\n                                -20-\n\f          This   case   was   well   handled   and   properly   decided.\n\nHowever, whatever fault can be imputed to the plaintiffs for making\n\nthe claim, all but one of the issues raised on appeal presented\n\nserious legal questions, and the appeal was legitimately pursued.\n\nWe have no inclination to make a separate award of attorney’s fees\n\nto McGraw-Hill for work done on the appeal, although the usual\n\naward of statutory costs is allowed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\f</pre>",
