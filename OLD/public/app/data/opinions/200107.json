Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n               Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Todd J. Lascola on brief pro se.\n     Margaret E. Curran, United States Attorney, Donald C.\nLockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, and Ira Belkin,\nAssistant United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                         September 3, 2002\n\f           Per Curiam. Todd J. LaScola, a licensed stockbroker,\n\npled guilty to nine counts of a 55 count indictment, alleging\n\nmail fraud, 18 U.S.C. §1341, wire fraud, 18 U.S.C. § 1343, and\n\nembezzlement, 18 U.S.C. § 664.        His crimes comprised several\n\nschemes involving two companies in which he was engaged, CPA\n\nAdvisors Network (\"CPA\") and CPI Investment Management, Inc.\n\n(\"CPI\").   LaScola was sentenced to 96 months imprisonment,\n\nthree   years   supervised      release,     and   restitution     of\n\napproximately $8.1 million dollars.        He challenges several of\n\nthe sentencing guideline calculations.       We affirm.\n           As an initial matter, LaScola makes an Apprendi type\n\nargument, see Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000),\nasserting that none of the upward adjustments (apart from\nminimal planning) was authorized because none was specifically\n\nmentioned in the indictment or in the plea agreement.            This\nargument was not raised in the district court and, thus, is\nsubject to the plain error standard.        There was no error, let\n\nalone plain error.     Apprendi does not apply to guideline\n\nfindings that increase the sentence but do not elevate it\nbeyond the statutory maximum.     United States v. Caba, 241 F.3d\n\n98, 101 (1st Cir. 2001).    The statutory maximum for each count\nof conviction was five years.    LaScola received a 60 month term\nof imprisonment on Count 1 (mail fraud) and concurrent 36\n\nmonths imprisonment on the remaining eight counts to be served\nconsecutive to the 60 month term imposed on Count 1 (for a\n\ntotal term of 96 months).\n\n                                -2-\n\f §2F1.1(b)(1) - Amount of loss1\n\n             The Presentence Report (\"PSR\") calculated that the\n\n total loss amount generated by LaScola's criminal conduct was\n between $5 and $10 million dollars and thus proposed a 14 level\n\n increase in the base offense level.    See §2F1.1(b)(1)(O).   In\n\n the district court, LaScola argued that the appropriate amount\n of loss was between $2.5 and $5 million dollars, reflecting a\n\n 13, rather than 14, level increase.       See §2F.1.1(b)(1)(N).\n\n LaScola argued that he did not pocket the $6 million obtained\n\n from the CPA clients to \"purchase\" the RBG Notes from Local\n\n 99's Plan and that he did not intend the loss to the CPA\n\n clients.    Rather, he hoped that the RBG Notes would mature and\n\n argued that, in fact, there was still some value to these\n Notes.     He analogized to fraudulent loan cases and suggested\n\n that, just as the value of the assets pledged to secure a\n\n fraudulent loan reduces the amount of loss in a fraudulent loan\n\n\n\n     1\n      We refer to the November 2000 Sentencing Guidelines. LaScola\ndid not object to the use of this version in the district court.\nOn appeal, he refers to the November 1998 version of the\nGuidelines, contending that \"[e]xcept for clarifications, the\nGuidelines in effect as of the last date of criminal activity, in\nthis case 1998 Guidelines, are to be used.\" Reply brief at p.15,\nn.1. In fact, however, \"[b]arring any ex post facto problem, a\ndefendant is to be punished according to the guidelines in effect\nat the time of sentencing.\" United States v. Harotunian, 920 F.2d\n1040, 1041-42 (1st Cir. 1990). In any event, for purposes of this\ncase, there is no dispositive distinction between the 1998 and 2000\nversions.\n     We note that, effective November 2001, the Sentencing\nCommission   deleted   the   separate  fraud   guideline   (§2F.1),\nconsolidating it with the theft guideline (§2B1.1), and resulting\nin a completely rewritten §2B1.1. We use the former designations\nof §2F1.1.\n\n                                -3-\n\f case, so too the \"value\" of the RBG Notes should reduce the\n\n amount of loss attributed to his conduct.    The court rejected\n\n that assessment, instead calculating the loss as the amount of\n money that LaScola improperly transferred from the various\n\n accounts -- well in excess of $5 million -- and concluding that\n\n LaScola's purported expectation that the Notes would mature was\n irrelevant.\n\n            \"We review the district court's interpretation of the\n\n loss provisions of the Guidelines de novo and review its\n\n factual findings only for clear error.\"       United States v.\n\n Blastos, 258 F.3d 25, 30 (1st Cir. 2001).    On appeal, LaScola\n\n contends that, although he was convicted of fraud, the court\n\n erroneously treated his conduct as a theft to determine the\n amount of loss.    There was no error.   The commentary to the\n\n fraud guideline itself provides for such cross-reference.   See\n\n U.S.S.G. §2F1.1, comment. (n.8). Further, LaScola continues to\n assert that his case is analogous to a fraudulent loan case and\n\n thus he should be credited with the \"value\" of the RBG Notes to\n offset any loss to his victims.     Amazingly, although LaScola\n\n conceded in the district court that the loss was $2.5 and $5\n\n million, he now contends on appeal that the net loss to the\n\n victims was $0.2    \"The Guidelines recognize loan fraud as a\n\n specific exception to the usual methods of calculating loss set\n\n\n     2\n      He relies on purported property appraisals of the real estate\ndevelopments supported by the RBG Notes, the worthiness of which is\nunknown, and, more importantly, are not properly before this court\nas they are not part of the district court record.\n\n                               -4-\n\fforth in §§2F1.1 and 2B1.1.\"       United States v. Stein, 233 F.3d\n\n6, 18 n.8 (1st Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 943 (2001).\n\nLaScola's attempt to mark his scheme as analogous to loan fraud\nis a grievous misfit.        There was no error in the district\n\ncourt's rejection of the attempt.\n\n§2F1.1(b)(6)(C) - Sophisticated means\n\n            In the district court, LaScola argued that there was\n\nsignificant overlap between the \"more than minimal planning\"\n\nadjustment, §2F1.1(b)(2)(A), and the \"sophisticated means\"\n\nadjustment, §2F1.1(b)(6)(C), such that it amounted to double\n\ncounting. LaScola did not renew this contention in his initial\n\nappellate    brief   and   the   government   contends   that   he   has\n\nabandoned that argument. LaScola tardily attempts to resurrect\nthis double counting argument in his reply brief but, as we\n\nhave repeatedly stated, \"a legal argument made for the first\n\ntime in an appellant's reply brief comes too late and need not\nbe addressed.\"    United States v. Brennan, 994 F.2d 918, 922 n.7\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\n\n             On appeal, LaScola contends that the district court\n\ndetermined    that   the   \"sophisticated     means\"   adjustment    was\n\nwarranted because he used a computer system to execute his\n\ncrimes and argues that this was error because operation of the\n\ncomputer program took little skill or training.          LaScola also\n\nargues that the computer software was used simply to carry out\n\nthe fraud and not to conceal it and, in fact, its use insured\n\nthe detection of the fraud because it would reveal the accounts\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f affected, by how much, and to where the missing funds had been\n\n sent.\n\n            LaScola's description of the basis of the court's\n ruling is deliberately myopic.        The district court found the\n\n application   of   the   \"sophisticated    means\"   adjustment   was\n\n warranted not because LaScola used a          computer system but\n because he not only stole the existing funds from CPA clients'\n\n accounts but converted those accounts to margin accounts,\n\n giving him the ability to borrow additional money in the\n\n clients' names.3   The emphasis and impetus for the finding of\n\n \"sophisticated means\" was not, as LaScola portrays it, on the\n\n use of a computer system itself but on how LaScola used that\n\n system in executing the offense by accessing his clients'\n accounts and converting them to margin accounts enabling him to\n\n steal more than the existing funds.       There was no error either\n\n in the court's factual finding or in its application of the\n sophisticated means adjustment.       See United States v. Humber,\n\n 255 F.3d at 1308, 1311 (11th Cir. 2001) (reciting standard of\n\n review).\n\n §2F1.1(b)(8)(A) - Failure of a financial institution\n\n            In the district court, LaScola argued against the\n\n application of this guideline on the ground that both CPI and\n\n CPA were purely sales organizations that, although may have\n\n     3\n      LaScola contends that the district court \"erred\" in stating\nthat he \"took\" the passwords. LaScola says that he did not take\nthe passwords; rather, he says, he instructed an employee with the\npassword to execute the transaction.       This is a meaningless\nquibble.\n\n                                 -6-\n\ffacilitated    trades,     never    actually    executed   trades   nor\n\ncustodied assets resulting from such trades.          He argued for a\n\ndistinction between an \"introducing broker\" which has a limited\ncapacity to perform functions and a \"clearing broker\" which is\n\nthe custodian of securities and can clear and settle trades in\n\na client's accounts.      According to LaScola, CPI simply managed\nassets and CPA simply processed transactions, relying upon\n\nWexford (the subsidiary of Prudential Securities), Fleet Bank\n\nand other financial institutions to execute trades or custody\n\nassets   and   those    financial    institutions,   argued   LaScola,\n\nremained safe, sound and solvent. The district court concluded\n\nthat both CPI and CPA met the guideline definition of financial\n\ninstitution and became insolvent as a result of LaScola's\nconduct.       It      rejected     LaScola's   distinction    between\n\n\"introducing broker\" and \"clearing broker\" as unavailing in\n\nlight of the clear language of the guideline definition.            See\n\nU.S.S.G. §2F1.1, comment. (n.19).\n\n           On appeal, LaScola renews his argument but provides\n\nno persuasive authority. There was no error in the application\n\nof this guideline adjustment.        See United States v. Ferrarini,\n\n219 F.3d 145, 159 (2d Cir. 2000) (reciting standard of review),\n\ncert. denied, 532 U.S. 1037 (2001).\n\n§3A1.1(b)(1) - Vulnerable victim\n\n           At sentencing, LaScola withdrew any objection to the\n\napplication of the vulnerable victim adjustment.           LaScola was\n\npersonally questioned by the district court as to whether he\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\funderstood that he was waiving his right to challenge that\n\nadjustment and he replied in the affirmative and stated that he\n\nhad no questions about his waiver.       Sentencing Tr. of 5/22/01\nat p.5.     Nonetheless, LaScola, on appeal, now argues that the\n\napplication of this guideline was error.             This challenge is\n\nwaived.   See United States v. Ciocca, 106 F.3d 1079, 1085 (1st\n\nCir. 1997) (refusing to review waived issue).\n\nDeparture\n\n            At   sentencing,   LaScola   made   an   oral   motion   for\n\ndeparture, arguing that the resulting guideline sentencing\n\nrange of 87 to 108 months was far in excess of the sentences\n\nimposed in other fraud cases in the districts of Rhode Island\n\nand Massachusetts.      In support, he proffered information he\napparently had obtained simply from the face of the court\n\ndockets, i.e., docket numbers, term of imprisonment imposed,\n\nand amount of restitution ordered.         He conceded that he was\nunaware of whether adjustment factors, such as vulnerable\n\nvictim and/or sophisticated means, were applied in these cases.\n\nThe district court rejected LaScola's proffered material as\n\ninsufficient to find that his case lay outside the heartland of\n\ncases and denied a downward departure.\n\n            On appeal, LaScola reiterates his downward departure\n\nargument, albeit in the guise of a \"heartland argument,\" but,\n\nas we have repeatedly held, a district court's refusal to\n\ndepart downward is not reviewable unless based on a mistake of\n\nlaw.   See United States v. Bunnell, 280 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir.\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f2002).   There was none here. The district court recited the\n\nproper standard for finding a departure but found LaScola's\n\nproffer insufficient to support one.   Moreover, we have held\n\"the fact that the national median for a broadly stated offense\n\ntype may be above or below a particular defendant's GSR cannot\n\nbe used to justify a sentencing departure.\"   United States v.\n\nMartin, 221 F.3d 52, 57 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -9-\n\f",

There was no error in the district\n\ncourt's rejection of the attempt.\n\n§2F1.1(b)(6)(C) - Sophisticated means\n\n            In the district court, LaScola argued that there was\n\nsignificant overlap between the \"more than minimal planning\"\n\nadjustment, §2F1.1(b)(2)(A), and the \"sophisticated means\"\n\nadjustment, §2F1.1(b)(6)(C), such that it amounted to double\n\ncounting. LaScola did not renew this contention in his initial\n\nappellate    brief   and   the   government   contends   that   he   has\n\nabandoned that argument. LaScola tardily attempts to resurrect\nthis double counting argument in his reply brief but, as we\n\nhave repeatedly stated, \"a legal argument made for the first\n\ntime in an appellant's reply brief comes too late and need not\nbe addressed.\"    United States v. Brennan, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"608079\"><a href=\"/opinion/608079/united-states-v-james-f-brennan-united-states-v-j-edward-mchugh/\"><span class=\"volume\">994</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">918</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 922 n.7\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\n\n             On appeal, LaScola contends that the district court\n\ndetermined    that   the   \"sophisticated     means\"   adjustment    was\n\nwarranted because he used a computer system to execute his\n\ncrimes and argues that this was error because operation of the\n\ncomputer program took little skill or training.          LaScola also\n\nargues that the computer software was used simply to carry out\n\nthe fraud and not to conceal it and, in fact, its use insured\n\nthe detection of the fraud because it would reveal the accounts\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f affected, by how much, and to where the missing funds had been\n\n sent.\n\n            LaScola's description of the basis of the court's\n ruling is deliberately myopic.        The district court found the\n\n application   of   the   \"sophisticated    means\"   adjustment   was\n\n warranted not because LaScola used a          computer system but\n because he not only stole the existing funds from CPA clients'\n\n accounts but converted those accounts to margin accounts,\n\n giving him the ability to borrow additional money in the\n\n clients' names.3   The emphasis and impetus for the finding of\n\n \"sophisticated means\" was not, as LaScola portrays it, on the\n\n use of a computer system itself but on how LaScola used that\n\n system in executing the offense by accessing his clients'\n accounts and converting them to margin accounts enabling him to\n\n steal more than the existing funds.       There was no error either\n\n in the court's factual finding or in its application of the\n sophisticated means adjustment.       See United States v. Humber,\n\n 255 F.3d at 1308, 1311 (11th Cir. 2001) (reciting standard of\n\n review).\n\n §2F1.1(b)(8)(A) - Failure of a financial institution\n\n            In the district court, LaScola argued against the\n\n application of this guideline on the ground that both CPI and\n\n CPA were purely sales organizations that, although may have\n\n     3\n      LaScola contends that the district court \"erred\" in stating\nthat he \"took\" the passwords. LaScola says that he did not take\nthe passwords; rather, he says, he instructed an employee with the\npassword to execute the transaction.       This is a meaningless\nquibble.\n\n                                 -6-\n\ffacilitated    trades,     never    actually    executed   trades   nor\n\ncustodied assets resulting from such trades.          He argued for a\n\ndistinction between an \"introducing broker\" which has a limited\ncapacity to perform functions and a \"clearing broker\" which is\n\nthe custodian of securities and can clear and settle trades in\n\na client's accounts.      According to LaScola, CPI simply managed\nassets and CPA simply processed transactions, relying upon\n\nWexford (the subsidiary of Prudential Securities), Fleet Bank\n\nand other financial institutions to execute trades or custody\n\nassets   and   those    financial    institutions,   argued   LaScola,\n\nremained safe, sound and solvent. The district court concluded\n\nthat both CPI and CPA met the guideline definition of financial\n\ninstitution and became insolvent as a result of LaScola's\nconduct.       It      rejected     LaScola's   distinction    between\n\n\"introducing broker\" and \"clearing broker\" as unavailing in\n\nlight of the clear language of the guideline definition.            See\n\nU.S.S.G. §2F1.1, comment. (n.19).\n\n           On appeal, LaScola renews his argument but provides\n\nno persuasive authority. There was no error in the application\n\nof this guideline adjustment.        See United States v. Ferrarini,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769502\"><a href=\"/opinion/769502/united-states-v-donald-ferrarini-everett-j-vieira-a-michael-kagan/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 159 (2d Cir. 2000) (reciting standard of review),\n\ncert. denied, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1037</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2001).\n\n§3A1.1(b)(1) - Vulnerable victim\n\n           At sentencing, LaScola withdrew any objection to the\n\napplication of the vulnerable victim adjustment.           LaScola was\n\npersonally questioned by the district court as to whether he\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\funderstood that he was waiving his right to challenge that\n\nadjustment and he replied in the affirmative and stated that he\n\nhad no questions about his waiver.       Sentencing Tr. of 5/22/01\nat p.5.     Nonetheless, LaScola, on appeal, now argues that the\n\napplication of this guideline was error.             This challenge is\n\nwaived.   See United States v. Ciocca, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197220\"><a href=\"/opinion/197220/united-states-v-ciocca/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1085 (1st\n\nCir. 1997) (refusing to review waived issue).\n\nDeparture\n\n            At   sentencing,   LaScola   made   an   oral   motion   for\n\ndeparture, arguing that the resulting guideline sentencing\n\nrange of 87 to 108 months was far in excess of the sentences\n\nimposed in other fraud cases in the districts of Rhode Island\n\nand Massachusetts.      In support, he proffered information he\napparently had obtained simply from the face of the court\n\ndockets, i.e., docket numbers, term of imprisonment imposed,\n\nand amount of restitution ordered.         He conceded that he was\nunaware of whether adjustment factors, such as vulnerable\n\nvictim and/or sophisticated means, were applied in these cases.\n\nThe district court rejected LaScola's proffered material as\n\ninsufficient to find that his case lay outside the heartland of\n\ncases and denied a downward departure.\n\n            On appeal, LaScola reiterates his downward departure\n\nargument, albeit in the guise of a \"heartland argument,\" but,\n\nas we have repeatedly held, a district court's refusal to\n\ndepart downward is not reviewable unless based on a mistake of\n\nlaw.

There was none here. The district court recited the\n\nproper standard for finding a departure but found LaScola's\n\nproffer insufficient to support one.   Moreover, we have held\n\"the fact that the national median for a broadly stated offense\n\ntype may be above or below a particular defendant's GSR cannot\n\nbe used to justify a sentencing departure.\"   United States v.\n\nMartin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"799752\"><a href=\"/opinion/799752/united-states-v-eugene-edward-martin/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">52</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n          The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                             -9-\n\f</pre>",
