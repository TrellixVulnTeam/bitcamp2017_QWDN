Defendant-appellant\n\nChristian Maldonado-Rivera appeals from the denial of his motion\n\nfor a new trial in this criminal case.    Concluding, as we do, that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the\n\nmotion, we affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           This case had its genesis in a surveillance of suspected\n\ndrug-trafficking activity at the Los Laureles housing project in\n\nBayamón, Puerto Rico.   The facts are uncomplicated.\n\n           On July 14, 2004, Nancy Méndez Acevedo (Méndez), a police\n\nofficer with twelve years of seniority on the force, was assigned\n\nto surveil a known drug point at Los Laureles.         To reach her\n\nsurveillance post, she drove an unmarked vehicle with tinted\n\nwindows and parked near a basketball court.     Within a few minutes\n\nof her arrival, she noticed a yellow Nissan Xterra drive up and\n\npark on the opposite side of the basketball court.\n\n           Méndez observed an individual, later identified as the\n\ndefendant, exit the Xterra with a nickel-plated pistol in his right\n\nhand.   Upon seeing the weapon, Méndez radioed for backup.        As\n\npatrol cars sped to the scene, she observed the defendant turn,\n\nthrow the firearm into the Xterra, and begin to flee.    An arriving\n\nofficer, Luis Lebrón Ramos (Lebrón), ran the defendant to ground in\n\nan apartment at the housing project.        In the meantime, Méndez\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fseized a loaded handgun and additional ammunition from within the\n\nXterra.\n\n          In      due    course,      a     federal       grand   jury     charged      the\n\ndefendant, in a single-count indictment, with being a felon in\n\npossession   of    a    firearm       and    ammunition.          See     18   U.S.C.    §§\n\n922(g)(1), 924(a)(2).           The defendant proclaimed his innocence.\n\nFollowing some procedural skirmishing (not relevant here, except\n\nfor the defendant's stipulation to a prior felony conviction), the\n\ncase was reached for trial before a jury on January 18, 2005.\n\n          Méndez        and   Lebrón,       among    others,      testified       for   the\n\nprosecution about the day's events.                   As part of its case, the\n\ngovernment   offered      testimony         that    the    defendant's         wallet   and\n\nidentification     were       found    inside       the    Xterra.        Finally,      the\n\ngovernment introduced an inventory slip for the contents of the\n\nXterra signed by the defendant as the vehicle's owner or driver.\n\n          Because       the    defendant       denied      actual    or    constructive\n\npossession of the firearm, the exact location of Méndez's parked\n\nvehicle became a hotly contested issue at trial.                          This emphasis\n\nstemmed from a sense that the vehicle's location directly affected\n\nthe clarity of Méndez's line of sight and, thus, the accuracy of\n\nher eyewitness testimony.             On cross-examination, defense counsel\n\npressed Méndez for details about where she had parked her vehicle.\n\nPresented with an inexact diagram of the scene, Méndez indicated\n\n\n\n\n                                            -3-\n\fthat she had parked in the \"second parking space\" from the corner.1\n\nMéndez also described the Xterra as being parked all the way across\n\nthe basketball court and slightly to the left of where she had\n\nparked.\n\n           The defense case rested mainly on an alibi: the defendant\n\nwas neither driving the car at the time in question nor toting a\n\npistol.    Several witnesses testified on the defendant's behalf.\n\nSome of them offered testimony that bore upon Méndez's account of\n\nwhat she had observed.   One such witness was Rodolfo Bladuell, who\n\nhad taken photographs of the parking lot from different angles.\n\nSeveral photographs taken from parking space two reflected a clear\n\nline of sight to the point at which the Xterra allegedly was\n\nparked.2   Photographs taken from the parking spaces immediately to\n\nthe right of parking space two reflected a partially obstructed\n\nline of sight.\n\n           Ana María Alicea-Aponte, who worked in the administrative\n\noffices of the Los Laureles housing project, testified that a\n\njunked green van occupied parking space two on July 14, 2004.\n\nAlicea-Aponte remembered the van because it had been situated in\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Although the parking spaces were not numbered, we refer to\nthis location, for ease of exposition, as \"parking space two.\"\n     2\n      Bladuell approximated the distance between these two points\nat 165 feet. Méndez had estimated the same distance as being about\n80 feet.\n\n                                -4-\n\fthe same spot for well over a year while the administration\n\nattempted to effect its removal.\n\n           In its rebuttal case, the government recalled Méndez, who\n\nreiterated that she had stopped her car in parking space two.         She\n\nalso testified that vehicles were parked on either side of her car;\n\na vehicle with flat tires was to her right, and a black vehicle was\n\nto her left.\n\n           After seven days of trial, the jury found the defendant\n\nguilty.   On April 28, 2005 — approximately three months after the\n\nverdict — the defendant moved for a new trial based on newly\n\ndiscovered evidence.       He relied upon a series of administrative\n\nreports and two photographs depicting the presence of a junked\n\ngreen van in or near parking space two.\n\n           The provenance of these items is relevant to this appeal.\n\nThe   defendant   claims   that,   during   the   trial,   Alicea-Aponte's\n\nsupervisor at the Los Laureles administrative offices received a\n\ntelephone call from an unidentified government agent.              As she\n\nrelated it, the agent requested documentation anent an abandoned\n\nvehicle in parking space two.        The supervisor later checked her\n\nfiles and found monthly reports (the most relevant of which spanned\n\nthe ten-month period from March through December of 2004) listing\n\nthe locations of abandoned vehicles at Los Laureles.             She also\n\nfound a photograph, apparently taken in August of 2004, depicting\n\na junked green van in or near parking space two.\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f            The supervisor never received a follow-up call from the\n\nagent.   However, she told Alicea-Aponte, at an unspecified date,\n\nabout the inquiry and about the items that she had retrieved.\n\nAlicea-Aponte then put the supervisor in touch with the defendant.\n\nThe motion papers do not elaborate upon the date on which either\n\nthe defendant or his counsel first learned of these events.\n\n            The new trial motion made reference to a third piece of\n\nevidence as well.     That item was a photograph that the defendant\n\nclaimed he had obtained from Janifer Cortés, his former girlfriend\n\nand the mother of his child. The photograph showed the defendant's\n\ninfant daughter in the arms of a friend standing next to a green\n\nvan in parking space two.         Cortés had testified as a defense\n\nwitness at the trial but had not been queried about the photograph\n\n(which purportedly was taken in October of 2004).                  In a sworn\n\nstatement attached to the motion, she explained that the roll of\n\nfilm containing the picture had not been developed until after the\n\ntrial had ended.\n\n            The defendant maintained that these pieces of evidence,\n\nsingly   and   in   the   aggregate,    would    have   impeached    Méndez's\n\ntestimony    and,   thus,   bolstered   the     credibility   of    his   alibi\n\nwitnesses.     The evidence was newly discovered, the defendant said,\n\nbecause he was not aware of it prior to or during the trial, and,\n\nin all events, he could not have predicted how Méndez's trial\n\n\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\ftestimony would evolve. Finally, he asserted that the new evidence\n\nwould in all likelihood have been outcome-determinative.\n\n          The government opposed the motion.     It argued that the\n\nevidence was not new in the requisite sense but, rather, easily\n\ncould have been made available for use at the trial; that it was\n\ncumulative and, therefore, not material; and that it would not have\n\nresulted in an acquittal.\n\n          On August 10, 2005, the district court denied the new\n\ntrial motion.    The court concluded that the proffered evidence was\n\navailable to the defendant prior to and during the trial and that,\n\nin the exercise of due diligence, he could (and should) have\n\ndiscovered it.    The court noted specifically that, given Alicea-\n\nAponte's trial testimony, the defendant had every incentive to seek\n\nverification of the green van's location.      With respect to the\n\nCortés photograph, the court explained that the defendant had not\n\nadvanced any satisfactory reason as to why the photograph was not\n\navailable prior to or during the trial.\n\n          The court added that even if the various pieces of\n\nevidence cited in the motion could be regarded as newly discovered,\n\nthey served only to impeach Méndez's testimony as to her exact\n\nposition when she saw the defendant and to corroborate Alicea-\n\nAponte's testimony about the presence of the junked green van.\n\nGiven the undisputed evidence that a nickel-plated pistol was\n\nretrieved from the Xterra and that the defendant had signed an\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\finventory of the Xterra's contents as that vehicle's driver or\n\nowner,   the   court   concluded   that      the    \"new\"   evidence     was   not\n\nsufficiently material to guilt or innocence to justify a new trial.\n\nSee United States v. Maldonado-Rivera, No. 04-390, slip op. at 8\n\n(D.P.R. Aug. 10, 2005) (unpublished) (concluding that \"[r]egardless\n\nof whether agent Méndez saw the defendant from the first, second,\n\nor third parking space, the evidence in this case proves beyond [a]\n\nreasonable doubt that she indeed could see the defendant from where\n\nshe was parked\").\n\n           Following    the   denial    of    the    new    trial   motion,    the\n\ndistrict   court   sentenced    the    defendant      to    serve    a   48-month\n\nincarcerative term.     This timely appeal ensued.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 provides that a\n\ndistrict court, upon motion of the defendant, may \"grant a new\n\ntrial if the interest of justice so requires.\"              To the extent that\n\nsuch a motion is grounded upon newly discovered evidence, it may be\n\nfiled at any time within three years of the verdict.                See id.    The\n\ndefendant's new trial motion was, therefore, timely.                The district\n\ncourt nonetheless denied it.\n\n           On appeal, the defendant argues that the district court\n\napplied the wrong legal standard and that, in any event, it\n\nimprovidently denied the motion.        We address these assignments of\n\nerror sequentially.\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\f          The two assigned errors call to mind different review\n\nmodalities.     The choice of a legal standard presents an abstract\n\nquestion of law and, thus, triggers de novo review.      See United\n\nStates v. Huddleston, 194 F.3d 214, 218 (1st Cir. 1999).    So long\n\nas the district court applies the right legal standard, however,\n\nits decision about whether to grant or deny the motion is a\n\njudgment call.     Consequently, that decision engenders review for\n\nabuse of discretion.    See United States v. Natanel, 938 F.2d 302,\n\n313 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n                       A.   The Legal Standard.\n\n          Typically, a motion for a new trial bottomed on newly\n\ndiscovered evidence requires a criminal defendant to make a four-\n\npart showing.    See United States v. Rodriguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d 1,\n\n14, 28 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Alicea, 205 F.3d 480, 487\n\n(1st Cir. 2000); United States v. Wright, 625 F.2d 1017, 1019 (1st\n\nCir. 1980).     That showing entails a demonstration that (i) the\n\nevidence upon which the defendant relies was unknown or unavailable\n\nto him at the time of trial; (ii) the failure to bring the evidence\n\nforward at trial was not occasioned by a lack of diligence on the\n\ndefendant's part; (iii) the evidence is material (as opposed to\n\nbeing merely cumulative or impeaching); and (iv) the evidence is\n\nsuch that its introduction would probably result in an acquittal\n\n\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fupon a retrial of the case.3         See Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019.       Under\n\nthis       conventional   approach   (which   we   shall   call   the   \"Wright\n\nstandard\"), the first and second requirements go hand in hand, as\n\ndo the third and fourth requirements.          But whatever groupings may\n\nbe made for ease in analysis, each of the four requirements must be\n\nsatisfied in order for the defendant to gain a new trial.                 See,\n\ne.g., Rodriguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d at 14; Huddleston, 194 F.3d at\n\n218.\n\n               The Wright standard applies to most, but not all, new\n\ntrial motions premised on newly discovered evidence. We say \"most\"\n\nbecause a modified standard applies when a defendant grounds his\n\nmotion on newly discovered evidence that was unknown or unavailable\n\ndue to the government's failure to disclose evidence favorable to\n\nthe accused and material to his defense.             See Brady v. Maryland,\n\n373 U.S. 83, 87 (1963); United States v. González-González, 258\n\nF.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n               If the basis for a new trial motion is a Brady violation\n\n— that is, a failure on the government's part to disclose Brady\n\ninformation — the law requires, on the third and fourth prongs of\n\nthe new trial test, only that the defendant show a reasonable\n\nprobability that, had the evidence been disclosed in time to permit\n\nits use at the trial, the result of the proceeding would have been\n\n\n       3\n      This means an \"actual probability that an acquittal would\nhave resulted if the evidence had been available.\" United States\nv. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1216, 1220 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                                      -10-\n\fdifferent.         Kyles   v.   Whitley,   514    U.S.   419,    433-34   (1995);\n\nGonzález-González, 258 F.3d at 20.               That, in turn, requires an\n\nanalysis of whether the trial, in the absence of the undisclosed\n\nevidence, resulted in a verdict \"worthy of confidence.\"               González-\n\nGonzález, 258 F.3d at 20 (quoting Kyles, 514 U.S. at 434); see\n\nRodriguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d at 28.\n\n            Because the standard applied to new trial motions based\n\non Brady violations — what we shall call the \"modified standard\" or\n\nthe \"Brady error rule\" — is less onerous and, thus, easier for\n\ndefendants to satisfy, see González-González, 258 F.3d at 20,\n\ndefendants have an incentive to \"try to shoehorn as much of the new\n\nevidence into the Brady category as possible,\" United States v.\n\nJosleyn, 206 F.3d 144, 152 (1st Cir. 2000).                     This case is no\n\nexception: the defendant suggests that a Brady violation occurred\n\nbecause the government \"found\" and failed to inform the defense\n\nabout the newly discovered evidence.             Building on that foundation,\n\nhe posits that the district court should have employed the modified\n\nstandard in evaluating his new trial motion.\n\n            The government rejoins on two fronts.           First, it asserts\n\nthat the defendant waived any Brady-based argument.                  Second, it\n\ndebunks the suggestion that a Brady violation occurred. Its bottom\n\nline   is   that    the    district   court   used    the   appropriate     legal\n\nstandard.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\f              We agree with the government that the defendant failed to\n\nraise any Brady-based claim before the district court.                  To the\n\ncontrary, in pressing his new trial motion, the defendant cited\n\nUnited States v. Montilla-Rivera, 115 F.3d 1060, 1064-65 (1st Cir.\n\n1997) — a Wright standard case — and framed his argument for a new\n\ntrial in terms of the Wright standard.                 There is no reference\n\neither in Montilla-Rivera or in the defendant's district court\n\nmemorandum to the special gloss that would be brought into play by\n\nthe existence of a Brady violation.\n\n              The   thrust   of   the    defendant's    argument   before    the\n\ndistrict court confirms his eschewal of the Brady error rule.                He\n\nmade     no   contention     below      that    the   government   either    had\n\ntransgressed Brady or had failed to turn over Brady material.\n\nBrady itself was conspicuously absent from the list of authorities\n\ncited    in   the   memorandum    that    the   defendant   submitted   in   the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n              This series of omissions precludes the \"wrong legal\n\nstandard\" arguments that the defendant seeks to advance in this\n\nvenue.    After all, \"[i]t is a bedrock rule that when a party has\n\nnot presented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil\n\nit in the court of appeals.\"         United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d 27,\n\n30 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n              We need not belabor this point because a more substantive\n\ninfirmity dogs the defendant's claim.                 The record contains no\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fevidence that, at any time prior to or during the trial, the\n\ngovernment was aware of any of the three pieces of proof mentioned\n\nin the motion.    This gap in the record is itself dispositive of the\n\nclaim that a Brady violation occurred.     For Brady to operate, the\n\ngovernment not only must know about undisclosed evidence but also\n\nmust have custody or control of that evidence.       See Lavallee v.\n\nCoplan, 374 F.3d 41, 44 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Bender,\n\n304 F.3d 161, 163 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          Here, the new evidence was, for aught that appears from\n\nthe record, unknown to the government until the defendant filed his\n\npost-trial motion.     By the defendant's own account, the agent who\n\nsupposedly placed the call to Alicea-Aponte's supervisor never\n\nfollowed up.     There is nothing to suggest that the evidence was in\n\nany way in the government's possession or under its control.\n\nAccordingly, the government had no opportunity, much less a duty,\n\nto disclose it.\n\n          The absence of such a showing is an insuperable obstacle\n\nhere.   The fact that the government allegedly made an effort to\n\nascertain whether some of the evidence existed will not suffice to\n\ntrigger a duty to disclose.    Nor does the fact that the government,\n\nthrough a more vigorous investigation, might have been able to\n\ndiscover the evidence.     See Bender, 304 F.3d at 164 (holding that\n\nBrady doctrine does not \"require[] a prosecutor to seek out and\n\n\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fdisclose exculpatory or impeaching material not in the government's\n\npossession\").\n\n            Before us, the defendant essays a related claim: that the\n\nBrady error rule applies because the government was guilty of the\n\nknowing use of perjured testimony (by which he means Méndez's\n\ntestimony).   Legally, this claim has its roots in a line of Supreme\n\nCourt decisions holding that a conviction obtained through the\n\nprosecution's knowing use of perjured testimony cannot stand. See,\n\ne.g., Napue v. Illinois, 360 U.S. 264, 269 (1959); Mooney v.\n\nHolohan, 294 U.S. 103, 112 (1935).           This case law is potentially\n\nsignificant to the standard applicable to the adjudication of the\n\ndefendant's new trial motion because we have held that \"the Brady\n\nerror rule should apply to claims of knowing use of perjured\n\ntestimony.\"      González-González, 258 F.3d at 21.4       Here, however,\n\nthe asserted claim cannot withstand even the most cursory scrutiny.\n\n            In his memorandum in support of his new trial motion,\n\nfiled in the district court, the defendant explicitly disclaimed\n\nany   argument    that   the   prosecution    had   knowingly   used   false\n\nevidence.   See Defendant's Memo. at 4 (\"Napue involves the knowing\n\nuse by the prosecution of false evidence.              That is not being\n\nalleged here, nor does defendant have any proof or indication of\n\n\n\n      4\n      In González-González, 258 F.3d at 22, we noted that, under\nSupreme Court precedent, there is a linguistic difference in the\nformulation of the legal rules applicable to each context.    We\nnonetheless adjudged these sets of rules \"equivalent.\" Id.\n\n                                    -14-\n\fthe same.\"). In other words, the defendant flatly conceded that he\n\nwas not alleging the knowing use of false or perjured testimony by\n\nthe prosecution.       A party who stakes out a position before the\n\ndistrict court cannot reverse his field and take an inconsistent\n\nposition on appeal simply because he perceives that doing so might\n\nwork to his advantage.     See, e.g., United States v. Joost, 133 F.3d\n\n125, 128 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Coady, 809 F.2d 119, 121\n\n(1st Cir. 1987).\n\n           To say more on this point would be supererogatory.            For\n\nthe reasons discussed above, we reject the defendant's importuning\n\nthat the district court should have used the Brady error rule,\n\nrather than the Wright standard, in adjudicating his new trial\n\nmotion.\n\n                 B.    The District Court's Decision.\n\n           Having determined that the lower court applied the proper\n\nlegal yardstick to the new trial motion, we next consider whether\n\nthe   court's   denial    of   the   motion   constituted   an   abuse    of\n\ndiscretion.\n\n           The district court rejected the motion on the basis that\n\nthe proffered evidence met none of the four requirements of the\n\nWright standard.      In the circumstances of this case, the first two\n\nrequirements are dispositive of the appeal.          These requirements\n\nconcern whether the evidence was unknown or unavailable to the\n\ndefendant at the time of trial and if so, whether that situation\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fwas attributable to a lack of due diligence on his part.                    See\n\nAlicea, 205 F.3d at 487; Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019.\n\n            We start with the materials retrieved by Alicea-Aponte's\n\nsupervisor:     the    monthly   \"abandoned     vehicle\"    reports   and    the\n\nphotograph of the junked green van.           There is no dispute that this\n\nevidence was in existence at the time of the trial.             The defendant\n\nnonetheless asserts that he was unaware of it until after the\n\nverdict.5      His explanation is that the issue of Méndez's exact\n\nlocation arose only when she testified at trial, and that the pace\n\nof the trial hampered his ability to take stock of evidentiary\n\nleads.   This explanation rings hollow.\n\n            While the defendant may not have known Méndez's precise\n\nvantage point prior to trial, he had every reason to believe that\n\nher line of sight was of the utmost importance.             That the defendant\n\nappreciated the salience of this datum before and during the trial\n\ncan be gleaned from two incontrovertible facts.             First, during the\n\ntrial,   the    defendant      had    his    investigator    (Bladuell)     take\n\nphotographs     of    the   parking   area   from   different   angles.     The\n\ncommissioning of these photographs is a clear indication that the\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      The motion papers are silent as to when the defendant\nactually learned of this evidence. That fact alone runs up a red\nflag because it leaves open the possibility that the defense was\ncontacted by Alicea-Aponte or her supervisor during the trial. Cf.\nAlicea, 205 F.3d at 487 (finding unpersuasive claim of newly\ndiscovered evidence where \"appellant's motion papers said nothing\nabout when or how he had learned of [it]\").\n\n                                      -16-\n\fdefense appreciated the potential import of Méndez's line of sight\n\nand had sufficient time to react to her testimony.6\n\n            The second fact emerges from the trial transcript.   The\n\ndefendant could not help but know that Méndez would be the key\n\nwitness against him.      Defense counsel, armed with previously\n\ngathered maps and diagrams of the parking area, pressed her on\n\ncross-examination for details about her exact location.    When the\n\ngovernment's case in chief concluded, the defense proceeded to\n\nmount a direct challenge to the clarity of Méndez's line of sight\n\nby, inter alia, eliciting testimony from Alicea-Aponte about a\n\njunked green van in parking space two.       In the course of this\n\nexegesis,     Alicea-Aponte    mentioned   the   housing   project's\n\n\"regulations\" governing abandoned vehicles, the \"steps\" taken by\n\nher office to urge noncompliant residents to change their ways, and\n\nthe regulatory requirement that the owner of an abandoned vehicle\n\n\"authorize\" any action that might be taken by the administration to\n\nremove it from the premises.\n\n             Given this body of knowledge, we think it readily\n\nevident that a reasonably prudent person would have considered the\n\npossibility that records existed at the administrative offices of\n\nLos Laureles that might bear on the critical line-of-sight issue\n\n(and, specifically, on the question of whether the junked green van\n\n\n     6\n      In this regard, it bears mentioning that the defendant did\nnot seek a continuance after Méndez completed her direct\nexamination.\n\n                                 -17-\n\fwas   in    fact   occupying   parking       space   two   on   July   14).      The\n\ndefendant, however, did not make any inquiry into either the\n\nexistence or the contents of any such records.\n\n              In the Rule 33 milieu, due diligence is a context-\n\nspecific concept.         See United States v. Cimera, 459 F.3d 452, 461\n\n(3d Cir. 2006); United States v. Hernández-Rodríguez, 443 F.3d 138,\n\n144 (1st Cir. 2006). As a general proposition, however, the movant\n\nmust exercise a degree of diligence commensurate with that which a\n\nreasonably      prudent    person    would    exercise     in   the    conduct    of\n\nimportant affairs.        See, e.g., Cimera, 459 F.3d at 461-62; United\n\nStates v. LaVallee, 439 F.3d 670, 701 (10th Cir. 2006).                 Where, as\n\nhere, the newly proffered evidence all pertains to a matter that\n\nthe defendant knew would be in issue at his trial, and the source\n\nof that evidence was an obvious one, the district court had every\n\nright to deem the requirement of due diligence unsatisfied.                   See,\n\ne.g., United States v. Canova, 412 F.3d 331, 349 (2d Cir. 2005).\n\n              The short of it is that the defendant had ample time and\n\nreason to investigate the situation that existed in the parking\n\narea.      He undertook some investigation into this situation but did\n\nnot investigate it fully.           He cannot now be allowed to interpose\n\nhis disregard of the obvious as an excuse for his failure to learn\n\nabout easily ascertainable evidence.             Cf. Paterson-Leitch Co. v.\n\nMass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co., 840 F.2d 985, 989-90 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\f1988) (\"Courts, like the Deity, are most frequently moved to help\n\nthose who help themselves.\").\n\n          Under   these   circumstances,    we   discern   no   abuse    of\n\ndiscretion in the district court's conclusion that the materials in\n\nthe Los Laureles files were available to the defendant at the time\n\nof trial and that, in the exercise of ordinary diligence, he would\n\n(and should) have discovered them.         Accordingly, that evidence\n\ncannot justify a new trial.     See United States v. Falu-Gonzalez,\n\n205 F.3d 436, 443 (1st Cir. 2000) (explaining that evidence that\n\ncould have been discovered in the exercise of due diligence cannot\n\ncomprise newly discovered evidence within the purview of Rule 33);\n\nsee also Wright, 625 F.2d at 1019 (discussing district court's\n\n\"broad power\" to evaluate the circumstances when considering a new\n\ntrial motion based on newly discovered evidence).\n\n          This leaves the third piece of \"new\" evidence: the Cortés\n\nphotograph.   The district court found that the defendant had not\n\nmet his obligation of showing why this photograph — which was taken\n\nbefore the trial began but not developed until after the trial\n\nended — could not have been discovered and made available in time\n\nfor use at the trial.      This finding is supportable given that\n\nCortés was called as a witness for the defense, was close to the\n\ndefendant, and had every reason to cooperate with him.                  See\n\nRodriguez-Marrero, 390 F.3d at 30.\n\n\n\n\n                                -19-\n\f           We refrain from any detailed analysis in this regard\n\nbecause it is crystal clear, as the district court also ruled, that\n\nthis piece of evidence did not satisfy the third prong of the\n\nWright standard: materiality. The photograph served, at most, only\n\nto impeach Méndez's description of her vantage point.\n\n           Evidence that is cumulative or of marginal relevance\n\nordinarily is insufficient to satisfy the third requirement of the\n\nWright standard.    See, e.g., United States v. Gwathney, 465 F.3d\n\n1133, 1144-45 (10th Cir. 2006); Natanel, 938 F.2d at 314.       So too\n\nevidence that is merely impeaching.        See, e.g., United States v.\n\nColón-Muñoz, 318 F.3d 348, 361 (1st Cir. 2003) (explaining that\n\n\"newly discovered evidence which is merely impeaching normally\n\ncannot form the basis for a new trial\" (citations and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted)).    The Cortés photograph, which was taken\n\nover two months after Méndez made her observations, does no more\n\nthan weakly supplement the steady stream of defense efforts to\n\nerode    Méndez's   credibility.      If   Alicea-Aponte's   testimony,\n\nBladuell's testimony, Bladuell's photographs, and the maps and\n\ndiagrams did not sully Méndez's credibility in the jurors' eyes, it\n\nis surpassingly difficult to believe that the Cortés photograph\n\nwould have made the slightest difference.7\n\n\n     7\n      The defendant strives to persuade us that the Cortés\nphotograph strikes at the heart of Méndez's veracity. He reasons\nthat if the junked green van was in fact parked both in parking\nspace two and to Méndez's right, there would have been no room for\nthe black car that Méndez recalled being parked to her left. We\n\n                                   -20-\n\fIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe conclude, without serious question, that the district court\n\nneither   applied   an   incorrect   legal   standard   nor   abused   its\n\ndiscretion in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\nare not convinced. Fairly viewed, the Cortés photograph — even if\nthe scene that it depicts existed on July 14 (more than two months\nearlier) — does not preclude the presence of another vehicle being\nparked, if haphazardly, to her left.\n\n                                 -21-\n\f",

Concluding, as we do, that the district court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case had its genesis in a surveillance of suspected drug-trafficking activity at the Los Laureles housing project in Bayam&#243;n, Puerto Rico. The facts are uncomplicated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 14, 2004, Nancy M&#233;ndez Acevedo (M&#233;ndez), a police officer with twelve years of seniority on the force, was assigned to surveil a known drug point at Los Laureles. To reach her surveillance post, she drove an unmarked vehicle with tinted windows and parked near a basketball court. Within a few minutes of her arrival, she noticed a yellow Nissan Xterra drive up and park on the opposite side of the basketball court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M&#233;ndez observed an individual, later identified as the defendant, exit the Xterra with a nickel-plated pistol in his right hand. Upon seeing the weapon, M&#233;ndez radioed for backup. As patrol cars sped to the scene, she observed the defendant turn, throw the firearm into the Xterra, and begin to flee. An arriving officer, Luis Lebr&#243;n Ramos (Lebr&#243;n), ran the defendant to ground in an apartment at the housing project. In the meantime, M&#233;ndez seized a loaded handgun and additional ammunition from within the Xterra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, a federal grand jury charged the defendant, in a single-count indictment, with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2). The defendant proclaimed his innocence. Following some procedural skirmishing (not relevant here, except for the defendant's stipulation to a prior felony conviction), the case was reached for trial before a jury on January 18, 2005.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M&#233;ndez and Lebr&#243;n, among others, testified for the prosecution about the day's events. As part of its case, the government offered testimony that the defendant's wallet and identification were found inside the Xterra. Finally, the government introduced an inventory slip for the contents of the Xterra signed by the defendant as the vehicle's owner or driver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the defendant denied actual or constructive possession of the firearm, the exact location of M&#233;ndez's parked vehicle became a hotly contested issue at trial. This emphasis stemmed from a sense that the vehicle's location directly affected the clarity of M&#233;ndez's line of sight and, thus, the accuracy of her eyewitness testimony. On cross-examination, defense counsel pressed M&#233;ndez for details about where she had parked her vehicle. Presented with an inexact diagram of the scene, M&#233;ndez indicated that she had parked in the \"second parking space\" from the corner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> M&#233;ndez also described the Xterra as being parked all the way across the basketball court and slightly to the left of where she had parked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense case rested mainly on an alibi: the defendant was neither driving the car at the time in question nor toting a pistol. Several witnesses testified on the defendant's behalf. Some of them offered testimony that bore upon M&#233;ndez's account of what she had observed. One such witness was Rodolfo Bladuell, who had taken photographs of the parking lot from different angles. Several photographs taken from parking space two reflected a clear line of sight to the point at which the Xterra allegedly was parked.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Photographs taken from the parking spaces immediately to the right of parking space two reflected a partially obstructed line of sight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ana Mar&#237;a Alicea-Aponte, who worked in the administrative offices of the Los Laureles housing project, testified that a junked green van occupied parking space two on July 14, 2004. Alicea-Aponte remembered the van because it had been situated in the same spot for well over a year while the administration attempted to effect its removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its rebuttal case, the government recalled M&#233;ndez, who reiterated that she had stopped her car in parking space two. She also testified that vehicles were parked on either side of her car; a vehicle with flat tires was to her right, and a black vehicle was to her left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After seven days of trial, the jury found the defendant guilty. On April 28, 2005 &#8212; approximately three months after the verdict &#8212; the defendant moved for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. He relied upon a series of administrative reports and two photographs depicting the presence of a junked green van in or near parking space two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provenance of these items is relevant to this appeal. The defendant claims that, during the trial, Alicea-Aponte's supervisor at the Los Laureles administrative offices received a telephone call from an unidentified government agent. As she related it, the agent requested documentation anent an abandoned vehicle in parking space two. The supervisor later checked her files and found monthly reports (the most relevant of which spanned the ten-month period from March through December of 2004) listing the locations of abandoned vehicles at Los Laureles. She also found a photograph, apparently taken in August of 2004, depicting a junked green van in or near parking space two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supervisor never received a follow-up call from the agent. However, she told Alicea-Aponte, at an unspecified date, about the inquiry and about the items that she had retrieved. Alicea-Aponte then put the supervisor in touch with the defendant. The motion papers do not elaborate upon the date on which either the defendant or his counsel first learned of these events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new trial motion made reference to a third piece of evidence as well. That item was a photograph that the defendant claimed he had obtained from Janifer Cort&#233;s, his former girlfriend and the mother of his child. The photograph showed the defendant's infant daughter in the arms of a friend standing next to a green van in parking space two. Cort&#233;s had testified as a defense witness at the trial but had not been queried about the photograph (which purportedly was taken in October of 2004). In a sworn statement attached to the motion, she explained that the roll of film containing the picture had not been developed until after the trial had ended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant maintained that these pieces of evidence, singly and in the aggregate, would have impeached M&#233;ndez's testimony and, thus, bolstered the credibility of his alibi witnesses. The evidence was newly discovered, the defendant said, because he was not aware of it prior to or during the trial, and, in all events, he could not have predicted how M&#233;ndez's trial testimony would evolve. Finally, he asserted that the new evidence would in all likelihood have been outcome-determinative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government opposed the motion. It argued that the evidence was not new in the requisite sense but, rather, easily could have been made available for use at the trial; that it was cumulative and, therefore, not material; and that it would not have resulted in an acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 10, 2005, the district court denied the new trial motion. The court concluded that the proffered evidence was available to the defendant prior to and during the trial and that, in the exercise of due diligence, he could (and should) have discovered it. The court noted specifically that, given Alicea-Aponte's trial testimony, the defendant had every incentive to seek verification of the green van's location. With respect to the Cort&#233;s photograph, the court explained that the defendant had not advanced any satisfactory reason as to why the photograph was not available prior to or during the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court added that even if the various pieces of evidence cited in the motion could be regarded as newly discovered, they served only to impeach M&#233;ndez's testimony as to her exact position when she saw the defendant and to corroborate Alicea-Aponte's testimony about the presence of the junked green van. Given the undisputed evidence that a nickel-plated pistol was retrieved from the Xterra and that the defendant had signed an inventory of the Xterra's contents as that vehicle's driver or owner, the court concluded that the \"new\" evidence was not sufficiently material to guilt or innocence to justify a new trial. <i>See United States v. Maldonado-Rivera,</i> No. 04-390, slip op. at 8 (D.P.R. Aug. 10, 2005) (unpublished) (concluding that \"[r]egardless of whether agent M&#233;ndez saw the defendant from the first, second, or third parking space, the evidence in this case proves beyond [a] reasonable doubt that she indeed could see the defendant from where she was parked\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the denial of the new trial motion, the district court sentenced the defendant to serve a 48-month incarcerative term. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 provides that a district court, upon motion of the defendant, may \"grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\" To the extent that such a motion is grounded upon newly discovered evidence, it may be filed at any time within three years of the verdict. <i>See id.</i> The defendant's new trial motion was, therefore, timely. The district court nonetheless denied it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard and that, in any event, it improvidently denied the motion. We address these assignments of error sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two assigned errors call to mind different review modalities. The choice of a legal standard presents an abstract question of law and, thus, triggers de novo review. <i>See United States v. Huddleston,</i> 194 F.3d 214, 218 (1st Cir. 1999). So long as the district court applies the right legal standard, however, its decision about whether to grant or deny the motion is a judgment call. Consequently, that decision engenders review for abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Natanel,</i> 938 F.2d 302, 313 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Legal Standard.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, a motion for a new trial bottomed on newly discovered evidence requires a criminal defendant to make a four-part showing. <i>See United States v.</i> <i>Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d 1, 14, 28 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Alicea,</i> 205 F.3d 480, 487 (1st Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Wright,</i> 625 F.2d 1017, 1019 (1st Cir. 1980). That showing entails a demonstration that (i) the evidence upon which the defendant relies was unknown or unavailable to him at the time of trial; (ii) the failure to bring the evidence forward at trial was not occasioned by a lack of diligence on the defendant's part; (iii) the evidence is material (as opposed to being merely cumulative or impeaching); and (iv) the evidence is such that its introduction would probably result in an acquittal upon a retrial of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See Wright,</i> 625 F.2d at 1019. Under this conventional approach (which we shall call the \"<i>Wright</i> standard\"), the first and second requirements go hand in hand, as do the third and fourth requirements. But whatever groupings may be made for ease in analysis, each of the four requirements must be satisfied in order for the defendant to gain a new trial. <i>See, e.g., Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d at 14; <i>Huddleston,</i> 194 F.3d at 218.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Wright</i> standard applies to most, but not all, new trial motions premised on newly discovered evidence. We say \"most\" because a modified standard applies when a defendant grounds his motion on newly discovered evidence that was unknown or unavailable due to the government's failure to disclose evidence favorable to the accused and material to his defense. <i>See Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 87, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963); <i>United States v. Gonz&#225;lez-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 258 F.3d 16, 20 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the basis for a new trial motion is a <i>Brady</i> violation &#8212; that is, a failure on the government's part to disclose <i>Brady</i> information &#8212; the law requires, on the third and fourth prongs of the new trial test, only that the defendant show a reasonable probability that, had the evidence been disclosed in time to permit its use at the trial, the result of the proceeding would have been different. <i>Kyles v. Whitley,</i> 514 U.S. 419, 433-34, 115 S.Ct. 1555, 131 L.Ed.2d 490 (1995); <i>Gonz&#225;lez-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 258 F.3d at 20. That, in turn, requires an analysis of whether the trial, in the absence of the undisclosed evidence, resulted in a verdict \"worthy of confidence.\" <i>Gonz&#225;lez-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 258 F.3d at 20 (quoting <i>Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 434, 115 S.Ct. 1555); <i>see Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d at 28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the standard applied to new trial motions based on <i>Brady</i> violations &#8212; what we shall call the \"modified standard\" or the \"<i>Brady</i> error rule\" &#8212; is less onerous and, thus, easier for defendants to satisfy, <i>see Gonz&#225;lez-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 258 F.3d at 20, defendants have an incentive to \"try to shoehorn as much of the new evidence into the <i>Brady</i> category as possible,\" <i>United States v. Josleyn,</i> 206 F.3d 144, 152 (1st Cir.2000). This case is no exception: the defendant suggests that a <i>Brady</i> violation occurred because the government \"found\" and failed to inform the defense about the newly discovered evidence. Building on that foundation, he posits that the district court should have employed the modified standard in evaluating his new trial motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government rejoins on two fronts. First, it asserts that the defendant waived any <i>Brady</i>-based argument. Second, it debunks the suggestion that a <i>Brady</i> violation occurred. Its bottom line is that the district court used the appropriate legal standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the government that the defendant failed to raise any <i>Brady</i>-based claim before the district court. To the contrary, in pressing his new trial motion, the defendant cited <i>United States v. Montilla-Rivera,</i> 115 F.3d 1060, 1064-65 (1st Cir.1997) &#8212; a <i>Wright</i> standard case &#8212; and framed his argument for a new trial in terms of the <i>Wright</i> standard. There is no reference either in <i>Montilla-Rivera</i> or in the defendant's district court memorandum to the special gloss that would be brought into play by the existence of a <i>Brady</i> violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The thrust of the defendant's argument before the district court confirms his eschewal of the <i>Brady</i> error rule. He made no contention below that the government either had transgressed <i>Brady</i> or had failed to turn over <i>Brady</i> material. <i>Brady</i> itself was conspicuously absent from the list of authorities cited in the memorandum that the defendant submitted in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This series of omissions precludes the \"wrong legal standard\" arguments that the defendant seeks to advance in this venue. After all, \"[i]t is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\" <i>United States v. Slade,</i> 980 F.2d 27, 30 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not belabor this point because a more substantive infirmity dogs the defendant's claim. The record contains no evidence that, at any time prior to or during the trial, the government was aware of any of the three pieces of proof mentioned in the motion. This gap in the record is itself dispositive of the claim that a <i>Brady</i> violation occurred. For <i>Brady</i> to operate, the government not only must know about undisclosed evidence but also must have custody or control of that evidence. <i>See Lavallee v. Coplan,</i> 374 F.3d 41, 44 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Bender,</i> 304 F.3d 161, 163 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, the new evidence was, for aught that appears from the record, unknown to the government until the defendant filed his post-trial motion. By the defendant's own account, the agent who supposedly placed the call to Alicea-Aponte's supervisor never followed up. There is nothing to suggest that the evidence was in any way in the government's possession or under its control. Accordingly, the government had no opportunity, much less a duty, to disclose it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of such a showing is an insuperable obstacle here. The fact that the government allegedly made an effort to ascertain whether some of the evidence existed will not suffice to trigger a duty to disclose. Nor does the fact that the government, through a more vigorous investigation, might have been able to discover the evidence. <i>See Bender,</i> 304 F.3d at 164 (holding that <i>Brady</i> doctrine does not \"require[] a prosecutor to seek out and disclose exculpatory or impeaching material not in the government's possession\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, the defendant essays a related claim: that the <i>Brady</i> error rule applies because the government was guilty of the knowing use of perjured testimony (by which he means M&#233;ndez's testimony). Legally, this claim has its roots in a line of Supreme Court decisions holding that a conviction obtained through the prosecution's knowing use of perjured testimony cannot stand. <i>See, e.g., Napue v. Illinois,</i> 360 U.S. 264, 269, 79 S.Ct. 1173, 3 L.Ed.2d 1217 (1959); <i>Mooney v. Holohan,</i> 294 U.S. 103, 112, 55 S.Ct. 340, 79 L.Ed. 791 (1935). This case law is potentially significant to the standard applicable to the adjudication of the defendant's new trial motion because we have held that \"the <i>Brady</i> error rule should apply to claims of knowing use of perjured testimony.\" <i>Gonz&#225;lez-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 258 F.3d at 21.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Here, however, the asserted claim cannot withstand even the most cursory scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his memorandum in support of his new trial motion, filed in the district court, the defendant explicitly disclaimed any argument that the prosecution had knowingly used false evidence. <i>See</i> Defendant's Memo. at 4 (\"<i>Napue</i> involves the knowing use by the prosecution of false evidence. That is not being alleged here, nor does defendant have any proof or indication of the same.\"). In other words, the defendant flatly conceded that he was <i>not</i> alleging the knowing use of false or perjured testimony by the prosecution. A party who stakes out a position before the district court cannot reverse his field and take an inconsistent position on appeal simply because he perceives that doing so might work to his advantage. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Joost,</i> 133 F.3d 125, 128 (1st Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Coady,</i> 809 F.2d 119, 121 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be supererogatory. For the reasons discussed above, we reject the defendant's importuning that the district court should have used the <i>Brady</i> error rule, rather than the <i>Wright</i> standard, in adjudicating his new trial motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The District Court's Decision.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the lower court applied the proper legal yardstick to the new trial motion, we next consider whether the court's denial of the motion constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected the motion on the basis that the proffered evidence met none of the four requirements of the <i>Wright</i> standard. In the circumstances of this case, the first two requirements are dispositive of the appeal. These requirements concern whether the evidence was unknown or unavailable to the defendant at the time of trial and if so, whether that situation was attributable to a lack of due diligence on his part. <i>See Alicea,</i> 205 F.3d at 487; <i>Wright,</i> 625 F.2d at 1019.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the materials retrieved by Alicea-Aponte's supervisor: the monthly \"abandoned vehicle\" reports and the photograph of the junked green van. There is no dispute that this evidence was in existence at the time of the trial. The defendant nonetheless asserts that he was unaware of it until after the verdict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> His explanation is that the issue of M&#233;ndez's exact location arose only when she testified at trial, and that the pace of the trial hampered his ability to take stock of evidentiary leads. This explanation rings hollow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the defendant may not have known M&#233;ndez's precise vantage point prior to trial, he had every reason to believe that her line of sight was of the utmost importance. That the defendant appreciated the salience of this datum before and during the trial can be gleaned from two incontrovertible facts. First, during the trial, the defendant had his investigator (Bladuell) take photographs of the parking area from different angles. The commissioning of these photographs is a clear indication that the defense appreciated the potential import of M&#233;ndez's line of sight and had sufficient time to react to her testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second fact emerges from the trial transcript. The defendant could not help but know that M&#233;ndez would be the key witness against him. Defense counsel, armed with previously gathered maps and diagrams of the parking area, pressed her on cross-examination for details about her exact location. When the government's case in chief concluded, the defense proceeded to mount a direct challenge to the clarity of M&#233;ndez's line of sight by, inter alia, eliciting testimony from Alicea-Aponte about a junked green van in parking space two. In the course of this exegesis, Alicea-Aponte mentioned the housing project's \"regulations\" governing abandoned vehicles, the \"steps\" taken by her office to urge noncompliant residents to change their ways, and the regulatory requirement that the owner of an abandoned vehicle \"authorize\" any action that might be taken by the administration to remove it from the premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this body of knowledge, we think it readily evident that a reasonably prudent person would have considered the possibility that records existed at the administrative offices of Los Laureles that might bear on the critical line-of-sight issue (and, specifically, on the question of whether the junked green van was in fact occupying parking space two on July 14). The defendant, however, did not make any inquiry into either the existence or the contents of any such records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Rule 33 milieu, due diligence is a context-specific concept. <i>See United States v. Cimera,</i> 459 F.3d 452, 461 (3d Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Hern&#225;ndez-Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 443 F.3d 138, 144 (1st Cir. 2006). As a general proposition, however, the movant must exercise a degree of diligence commensurate with that which a reasonably prudent person would exercise in the conduct of important affairs. <i>See, e.g., Cimera,</i> 459 F.3d at 461-62; <i>United States v. LaVallee,</i> 439 F.3d 670, 701 (10th Cir.2006). Where, as here, the newly proffered evidence all pertains to a matter that the defendant knew would be in issue at his trial, and the source of that evidence was an obvious one, the district court had every right to deem the requirement of due diligence unsatisfied. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Canova,</i> 412 F.3d 331, 349 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the defendant had ample time and reason to investigate the situation that existed in the parking area. He undertook some investigation into this situation but did not investigate it fully. He cannot now be allowed to interpose his disregard of the obvious as an excuse for his failure to learn about easily ascertainable evidence. <i>Cf. Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co.,</i> 840 F.2d 985, 989-90 (1st Cir.1988) (\"Courts, like the Deity, are most frequently moved to help those who help themselves.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we discern no abuse of discretion in the district court's conclusion that the materials in the Los Laureles files were available to the defendant at the time of trial and that, in the exercise of ordinary diligence, he would (and should) have discovered them. Accordingly, that evidence cannot justify a new trial. <i>See United States v. Falu-Gonzalez,</i> 205 F.3d 436, 443 (1st Cir.2000) (explaining that evidence that could have been discovered in the exercise of due diligence cannot comprise newly discovered evidence within the purview of Rule 33); <i>see also Wright,</i> 625 F.2d at 1019 (discussing district court's \"broad power\" to evaluate the circumstances when considering a new trial motion based on newly discovered evidence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the third piece of \"new\" evidence: the Cort&#233;s photograph. The district court found that the defendant had not met his obligation of showing why this photograph &#8212; which was taken before the trial began but not developed until after the trial ended &#8212; could not have been discovered and made available in time for use at the trial. This finding is supportable given that Cort&#233;s was called as a witness for the defense, was close to the defendant, and had every reason to cooperate with him. <i>See Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d at 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We refrain from any detailed analysis in this regard because it is crystal clear, as the district court also ruled, that this piece of evidence did not satisfy the third prong of the <i>Wright</i> standard: materiality. The photograph served, at most, only to impeach M&#233;ndez's description of her vantage point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence that is cumulative or of marginal relevance ordinarily is insufficient to satisfy the third requirement of the <i>Wright</i> standard. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Gwathney,</i> 465 F.3d 1133, 1144-45 (10th Cir.2006); <i>Natanel,</i> 938 F.2d at 314. So too evidence that is merely impeaching. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Col&#243;n-Mu&#241;oz,</i> 318 F.3d 348, 361 (1st Cir. 2003) (explaining that \"newly discovered evidence which is merely impeaching normally cannot form the basis for a new trial\" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). The Cort&#233;s photograph, which was taken over two months <i>after</i> M&#233;ndez made her observations, does no more than weakly supplement the steady stream of defense efforts to erode M&#233;ndez's credibility. If Alicea-Aponte's testimony, Bladuell's testimony, Bladuell's photographs, and the maps and diagrams did not sully M&#233;ndez's credibility in the jurors' eyes, it is surpassingly difficult to believe that the Cort&#233;s photograph would have made the slightest difference.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we conclude, without serious question, that the district court neither applied an incorrect legal standard nor abused its discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the parking spaces were not numbered, we refer to this location, for ease of exposition, as \"parking space two.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Bladuell approximated the distance between these two points at 165 feet.

That fact alone runs up a red flag because it leaves open the possibility that the defense was contacted by Alicea-Aponte or her supervisor during the trial<i>Cf.

He reasons that if the junked green van was in fact parked both in parking space two and to M&#233;ndez's right, there would have been no room for the black car that M&#233;ndez recalled being parked to her left. We are not convinced. Fairly viewed, the Cort&#233;s photograph &#8212; even if the scene that it depicts existed on July 14 (more than two months earlier) &#8212; does not preclude the presence of another vehicle being parked, if haphazardly, to her left</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case had its genesis in a surveillance of suspected drug-trafficking activity at the Los Laureles housing project in Bayam&#243;n, Puerto Rico. The facts are uncomplicated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 14, 2004, Nancy M&#233;ndez Acevedo (M&#233;ndez), a police officer with twelve years of seniority on the force, was assigned to surveil a known drug point at Los Laureles. To reach her surveillance post, she drove an unmarked vehicle with tinted windows and parked near a basketball court. Within a few minutes of her arrival, she noticed a yellow Nissan Xterra drive up and park on the opposite side of the basketball court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M&#233;ndez observed an individual, later identified as the defendant, exit the Xterra with a nickel-plated pistol in his right hand. Upon seeing the weapon, M&#233;ndez radioed for backup. As patrol cars sped to the scene, she observed the defendant turn, throw the firearm into the Xterra, and begin to flee. An arriving officer, Luis Lebr&#243;n Ramos (Lebr&#243;n), ran the defendant to ground in an apartment at the housing project. In the meantime, M&#233;ndez seized a loaded handgun and additional ammunition from within the Xterra.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, a federal grand jury charged the defendant, in a single-count indictment, with being a felon in possession of a firearm and ammunition. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 922(g)(1), 924(a)(2). The defendant proclaimed his innocence. Following some procedural skirmishing (not relevant here, except for the defendant's stipulation to a prior felony conviction), the case was reached for trial before a jury on January 18, 2005.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">M&#233;ndez and Lebr&#243;n, among others, testified for the prosecution about the day's events. As part of its case, the government offered testimony that the defendant's wallet and identification were found inside the Xterra. Finally, the government introduced an inventory slip for the contents of the Xterra signed by the defendant as the vehicle's owner or driver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the defendant denied actual or constructive possession of the firearm, the exact location of M&#233;ndez's parked vehicle became a hotly contested issue at trial. This emphasis stemmed from a sense that the vehicle's location directly affected the clarity of M&#233;ndez's line of sight and, thus, the accuracy of her eyewitness testimony. On cross-examination, defense counsel pressed M&#233;ndez for details about where she had parked her vehicle. Presented with an inexact diagram of the scene, M&#233;ndez indicated that she had parked in the \"second parking space\" from the corner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> M&#233;ndez also described the Xterra as being parked all the way across the basketball court and slightly to the left of where she had parked.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense case rested mainly on an alibi: the defendant was neither driving the car at the time in question nor toting a pistol. Several witnesses testified on the defendant's behalf. Some of them offered testimony that bore upon M&#233;ndez's account of what she had observed. One such witness was Rodolfo Bladuell, who had taken photographs of the parking lot from different angles. Several photographs taken from parking space two reflected a clear line of sight to the point at which the Xterra allegedly was parked.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Photographs taken from the parking spaces immediately to the right of parking space two reflected a partially obstructed line of sight.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ana Mar&#237;a Alicea-Aponte, who worked in the administrative offices of the Los Laureles housing project, testified that a junked green van occupied parking space two on July 14, 2004. Alicea-Aponte remembered the van because it had been situated in the same spot for well over a year while the administration attempted to effect its removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its rebuttal case, the government recalled M&#233;ndez, who reiterated that she had stopped her car in parking space two. She also testified that vehicles were parked on either side of her car; a vehicle with flat tires was to her right, and a black vehicle was to her left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After seven days of trial, the jury found the defendant guilty. On April 28, 2005 &#8212; approximately three months after the verdict &#8212; the defendant moved for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. He relied upon a series of administrative reports and two photographs depicting the presence of a junked green van in or near parking space two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provenance of these items is relevant to this appeal. The defendant claims that, during the trial, Alicea-Aponte's supervisor at the Los Laureles administrative offices received a telephone call from an unidentified government agent. As she related it, the agent requested documentation anent an abandoned vehicle in parking space two. The supervisor later checked her files and found monthly reports (the most relevant of which spanned the ten-month period from March through December of 2004) listing the locations of abandoned vehicles at Los Laureles. She also found a photograph, apparently taken in August of 2004, depicting a junked green van in or near parking space two.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The supervisor never received a follow-up call from the agent. However, she told Alicea-Aponte, at an unspecified date, about the inquiry and about the items that she had retrieved. Alicea-Aponte then put the supervisor in touch with the defendant. The motion papers do not elaborate upon the date on which either the defendant or his counsel first learned of these events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The new trial motion made reference to a third piece of evidence as well. That item was a photograph that the defendant claimed he had obtained from Janifer Cort&#233;s, his former girlfriend and the mother of his child. The photograph showed the defendant's infant daughter in the arms of a friend standing next to a green van in parking space two. Cort&#233;s had testified as a defense witness at the trial but had not been queried about the photograph (which purportedly was taken in October of 2004). In a sworn statement attached to the motion, she explained that the roll of film containing the picture had not been developed until after the trial had ended.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant maintained that these pieces of evidence, singly and in the aggregate, would have impeached M&#233;ndez's testimony and, thus, bolstered the credibility of his alibi witnesses. The evidence was newly discovered, the defendant said, because he was not aware of it prior to or during the trial, and, in all events, he could not have predicted how M&#233;ndez's trial testimony would evolve. Finally, he asserted that the new evidence would in all likelihood have been outcome-determinative.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government opposed the motion. It argued that the evidence was not new in the requisite sense but, rather, easily could have been made available for use at the trial; that it was cumulative and, therefore, not material; and that it would not have resulted in an acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 10, 2005, the district court denied the new trial motion. The court concluded that the proffered evidence was available to the defendant prior to and during the trial and that, in the exercise of due diligence, he could (and should) have discovered it. The court noted specifically that, given Alicea-Aponte's trial testimony, the defendant had every incentive to seek verification of the green van's location. With respect to the Cort&#233;s photograph, the court explained that the defendant had not advanced any satisfactory reason as to why the photograph was not available prior to or during the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court added that even if the various pieces of evidence cited in the motion could be regarded as newly discovered, they served only to impeach M&#233;ndez's testimony as to her exact position when she saw the defendant and to corroborate Alicea-Aponte's testimony about the presence of the junked green van. Given the undisputed evidence that a nickel-plated pistol was retrieved from the Xterra and that the defendant had signed an inventory of the Xterra's contents as that vehicle's driver or owner, the court concluded that the \"new\" evidence was not sufficiently material to guilt or innocence to justify a new trial. <i>See United States v. Maldonado-Rivera,</i> No. 04-390, slip op. at 8 (D.P.R. Aug. 10, 2005) (unpublished) (concluding that \"[r]egardless of whether agent M&#233;ndez saw the defendant from the first, second, or third parking space, the evidence in this case proves beyond [a] reasonable doubt that she indeed could see the defendant from where she was parked\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the denial of the new trial motion, the district court sentenced the defendant to serve a 48-month incarcerative term. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 33 provides that a district court, upon motion of the defendant, may \"grant a new trial if the interest of justice so requires.\" To the extent that such a motion is grounded upon newly discovered evidence, it may be filed at any time within three years of the verdict. <i>See id.</i> The defendant's new trial motion was, therefore, timely. The district court nonetheless denied it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the defendant argues that the district court applied the wrong legal standard and that, in any event, it improvidently denied the motion. We address these assignments of error sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The two assigned errors call to mind different review modalities. The choice of a legal standard presents an abstract question of law and, thus, triggers de novo review. <i>See United States v. Huddleston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766478\"><a href=\"/opinion/766478/united-states-v-mark-e-huddleston/\"><span class=\"volume\">194</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">214</span></a></span>, 218 (1st Cir. 1999). So long as the district court applies the right legal standard, however, its decision about whether to grant or deny the motion is a judgment call. Consequently, that decision engenders review for abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Natanel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564772\"><a href=\"/opinion/564772/united-states-v-efraim-natanel-aka-efriam-natanel/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 313 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Legal Standard.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Typically, a motion for a new trial bottomed on newly discovered evidence requires a criminal defendant to make a four-part showing. <i>See United States v.</i> <i>Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"788441\"><a href=\"/opinion/788441/united-states-v-jose-rodriguez-marrero-united-states-of-america-v-omar/\"><span class=\"volume\">390</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 14, 28 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v.

That showing entails a demonstration that (i) the evidence upon which the defendant relies was unknown or unavailable to him at the time of trial; (ii) the failure to bring the evidence forward at trial was not occasioned by a lack of diligence on the defendant's part; (iii) the evidence is material (as opposed to being merely cumulative or impeaching); and (iv) the evidence is such that its introduction would probably result in an acquittal upon a retrial of the case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See Wright,</i> 625 F.2d at 1019. Under this conventional approach (which we shall call the \"<i>Wright</i> standard\"), the first and second requirements go hand in hand, as do the third and fourth requirements. But whatever groupings may be made for ease in analysis, each of the four requirements must be satisfied in order for the defendant to gain a new trial. <i>See, e.g., Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d at 14; <i>Huddleston,</i> 194 F.3d at 218.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Wright</i> standard applies to most, but not all, new trial motions premised on newly discovered evidence. We say \"most\" because a modified standard applies when a defendant grounds his motion on newly discovered evidence that was unknown or unavailable due to the government's failure to disclose evidence favorable to the accused and material to his defense. <i>See Brady v.

Josleyn,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767958\"><a href=\"/opinion/767958/united-states-v-dennis-r-josleyn-united-states-of-america-v-john-w/\"><span class=\"volume\">206</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, 152 (1st Cir.2000). This case is no exception: the defendant suggests that a <i>Brady</i> violation occurred because the government \"found\" and failed to inform the defense about the newly discovered evidence. Building on that foundation, he posits that the district court should have employed the modified standard in evaluating his new trial motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government rejoins on two fronts. First, it asserts that the defendant waived any <i>Brady</i>-based argument. Second, it debunks the suggestion that a <i>Brady</i> violation occurred. Its bottom line is that the district court used the appropriate legal standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the government that the defendant failed to raise any <i>Brady</i>-based claim before the district court. To the contrary, in pressing his new trial motion, the defendant cited <i>United States v. Montilla-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197423\"><a href=\"/opinion/197423/united-states-v-montilla-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></a></span>, 1064-65 (1st Cir.1997) &#8212; a <i>Wright</i> standard case &#8212; and framed his argument for a new trial in terms of the <i>Wright</i> standard. There is no reference either in <i>Montilla-Rivera</i> or in the defendant's district court memorandum to the special gloss that would be brought into play by the existence of a <i>Brady</i> violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The thrust of the defendant's argument before the district court confirms his eschewal of the <i>Brady</i> error rule. He made no contention below that the government either had transgressed <i>Brady</i> or had failed to turn over <i>Brady</i> material. <i>Brady</i> itself was conspicuously absent from the list of authorities cited in the memorandum that the defendant submitted in the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This series of omissions precludes the \"wrong legal standard\" arguments that the defendant seeks to advance in this venue. After all, \"[i]t is a bedrock rule that when a party has not presented an argument to the district court, she may not unveil it in the court of appeals.\" <i>United States v.

The record contains no evidence that, at any time prior to or during the trial, the government was aware of any of the three pieces of proof mentioned in the motion. This gap in the record is itself dispositive of the claim that a <i>Brady</i> violation occurred. For <i>Brady</i> to operate, the government not only must know about undisclosed evidence but also must have custody or control of that evidence. <i>See Lavallee v. Coplan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201107\"><a href=\"/opinion/201107/lavallee-v-coplan/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v.

By the defendant's own account, the agent who supposedly placed the call to Alicea-Aponte's supervisor never followed up. There is nothing to suggest that the evidence was in any way in the government's possession or under its control. Accordingly, the government had no opportunity, much less a duty, to disclose it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The absence of such a showing is an insuperable obstacle here. The fact that the government allegedly made an effort to ascertain whether some of the evidence existed will not suffice to trigger a duty to disclose. Nor does the fact that the government, through a more vigorous investigation, might have been able to discover the evidence. <i>See Bender,</i> 304 F.3d at 164 (holding that <i>Brady</i> doctrine does not \"require[] a prosecutor to seek out and disclose exculpatory or impeaching material not in the government's possession\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, the defendant essays a related claim: that the <i>Brady</i> error rule applies because the government was guilty of the knowing use of perjured testimony (by which he means M&#233;ndez's testimony). Legally, this claim has its roots in a line of Supreme Court decisions holding that a conviction obtained through the prosecution's knowing use of perjured testimony cannot stand. <i>See, e.g., Napue v.

This case law is potentially significant to the standard applicable to the adjudication of the defendant's new trial motion because we have held that \"the <i>Brady</i> error rule should apply to claims of knowing use of perjured testimony.\" <i>Gonz&#225;lez-Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 258 F.3d at 21.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Here, however, the asserted claim cannot withstand even the most cursory scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his memorandum in support of his new trial motion, filed in the district court, the defendant explicitly disclaimed any argument that the prosecution had knowingly used false evidence. <i>See</i> Defendant's Memo. at 4 (\"<i>Napue</i> involves the knowing use by the prosecution of false evidence. That is not being alleged here, nor does defendant have any proof or indication of the same.\"). In other words, the defendant flatly conceded that he was <i>not</i> alleging the knowing use of false or perjured testimony by the prosecution. A party who stakes out a position before the district court cannot reverse his field and take an inconsistent position on appeal simply because he perceives that doing so might work to his advantage. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Joost,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750075\"><a href=\"/opinion/750075/united-states-v-robert-m-joost/\"><span class=\"volume\">133</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span>, 128 (1st Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Coady,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"481634\"><a href=\"/opinion/481634/united-states-v-neil-patrick-coady/\"><span class=\"volume\">809</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">119</span></a></span>, 121 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be supererogatory. For the reasons discussed above, we reject the defendant's importuning that the district court should have used the <i>Brady</i> error rule, rather than the <i>Wright</i> standard, in adjudicating his new trial motion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The District Court's Decision.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having determined that the lower court applied the proper legal yardstick to the new trial motion, we next consider whether the court's denial of the motion constituted an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected the motion on the basis that the proffered evidence met none of the four requirements of the <i>Wright</i> standard. In the circumstances of this case, the first two requirements are dispositive of the appeal. These requirements concern whether the evidence was unknown or unavailable to the defendant at the time of trial and if so, whether that situation was attributable to a lack of due diligence on his part. <i>See Alicea,</i> 205 F.3d at 487; <i>Wright,</i> 625 F.2d at 1019.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with the materials retrieved by Alicea-Aponte's supervisor: the monthly \"abandoned vehicle\" reports and the photograph of the junked green van. There is no dispute that this evidence was in existence at the time of the trial. The defendant nonetheless asserts that he was unaware of it until after the verdict.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> His explanation is that the issue of M&#233;ndez's exact location arose only when she testified at trial, and that the pace of the trial hampered his ability to take stock of evidentiary leads. This explanation rings hollow.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the defendant may not have known M&#233;ndez's precise vantage point prior to trial, he had every reason to believe that her line of sight was of the utmost importance. That the defendant appreciated the salience of this datum before and during the trial can be gleaned from two incontrovertible facts. First, during the trial, the defendant had his investigator (Bladuell) take photographs of the parking area from different angles. The commissioning of these photographs is a clear indication that the defense appreciated the potential import of M&#233;ndez's line of sight and had sufficient time to react to her testimony.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second fact emerges from the trial transcript. The defendant could not help but know that M&#233;ndez would be the key witness against him. Defense counsel, armed with previously gathered maps and diagrams of the parking area, pressed her on cross-examination for details about her exact location. When the government's case in chief concluded, the defense proceeded to mount a direct challenge to the clarity of M&#233;ndez's line of sight by, inter alia, eliciting testimony from Alicea-Aponte about a junked green van in parking space two. In the course of this exegesis, Alicea-Aponte mentioned the housing project's \"regulations\" governing abandoned vehicles, the \"steps\" taken by her office to urge noncompliant residents to change their ways, and the regulatory requirement that the owner of an abandoned vehicle \"authorize\" any action that might be taken by the administration to remove it from the premises.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this body of knowledge, we think it readily evident that a reasonably prudent person would have considered the possibility that records existed at the administrative offices of Los Laureles that might bear on the critical line-of-sight issue (and, specifically, on the question of whether the junked green van was in fact occupying parking space two on July 14). The defendant, however, did not make any inquiry into either the existence or the contents of any such records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the Rule 33 milieu, due diligence is a context-specific concept. <i>See United States v. Cimera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"795365\"><a href=\"/opinion/795365/united-states-v-keith-cimera/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">452</span></a></span>, 461 (3d Cir.2006); <i>United States v. Hern&#225;ndez-Rodr&#237;guez,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">443</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">138</span></span>, 144 (1st Cir. 2006). As a general proposition, however, the movant must exercise a degree of diligence commensurate with that which a reasonably prudent person would exercise in the conduct of important affairs. <i>See, e.g., Cimera,</i> 459 F.3d at 461-62; <i>United States v. LaVallee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"167150\"><a href=\"/opinion/167150/united-states-v-verbickas/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">670</span></a></span>, 701 (10th Cir.2006). Where, as here, the newly proffered evidence all pertains to a matter that the defendant knew would be in issue at his trial, and the source of that evidence was an obvious one, the district court had every right to deem the requirement of due diligence unsatisfied. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Canova,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790692\"><a href=\"/opinion/790692/united-states-of-america-cross-appellee-v-john-canova/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">331</span></a></span>, 349 (2d Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that the defendant had ample time and reason to investigate the situation that existed in the parking area. He undertook some investigation into this situation but did not investigate it fully. He cannot now be allowed to interpose his disregard of the obvious as an excuse for his failure to learn about easily ascertainable evidence. <i>Cf. Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"502424\"><a href=\"/opinion/502424/paterson-leitch-company-inc-v-massachusetts-municipal-wholesale-electric/\"><span class=\"volume\">840</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">985</span></a></span>, 989-90 (1st Cir.1988) (\"Courts, like the Deity, are most frequently moved to help those who help themselves.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under these circumstances, we discern no abuse of discretion in the district court's conclusion that the materials in the Los Laureles files were available to the defendant at the time of trial and that, in the exercise of ordinary diligence, he would (and should) have discovered them. Accordingly, that evidence cannot justify a new trial. <i>See United States v. Falu-Gonzalez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767872\"><a href=\"/opinion/767872/united-states-v-confesor-falu-gonzalez-aka-pepo/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span>, 443 (1st Cir.2000) (explaining that evidence that could have been discovered in the exercise of due diligence cannot comprise newly discovered evidence within the purview of Rule 33); <i>see also Wright,</i> 625 F.2d at 1019 (discussing district court's \"broad power\" to evaluate the circumstances when considering a new trial motion based on newly discovered evidence).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the third piece of \"new\" evidence: the Cort&#233;s photograph. The district court found that the defendant had not met his obligation of showing why this photograph &#8212; which was taken before the trial began but not developed until after the trial ended &#8212; could not have been discovered and made available in time for use at the trial. This finding is supportable given that Cort&#233;s was called as a witness for the defense, was close to the defendant, and had every reason to cooperate with him. <i>See Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d at 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We refrain from any detailed analysis in this regard because it is crystal clear, as the district court also ruled, that this piece of evidence did not satisfy the third prong of the <i>Wright</i> standard: materiality. The photograph served, at most, only to impeach M&#233;ndez's description of her vantage point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence that is cumulative or of marginal relevance ordinarily is insufficient to satisfy the third requirement of the <i>Wright</i> standard. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Gwathney,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1133</span></span>, 1144-45 (10th Cir.2006); <i>Natanel,</i> 938 F.2d at 314. So too evidence that is merely impeaching. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Col&#243;n-Mu&#241;oz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780710\"><a href=\"/opinion/780710/united-states-v-ramiro-l-colon-munoz/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></a></span>, 361 (1st Cir. 2003) (explaining that \"newly discovered evidence which is merely impeaching normally cannot form the basis for a new trial\" (citations and internal quotation marks omitted)). The Cort&#233;s photograph, which was taken over two months <i>after</i> M&#233;ndez made her observations, does no more than weakly supplement the steady stream of defense efforts to erode M&#233;ndez's credibility. If Alicea-Aponte's testimony, Bladuell's testimony, Bladuell's photographs, and the maps and diagrams did not sully M&#233;ndez's credibility in the jurors' eyes, it is surpassingly difficult to believe that the Cort&#233;s photograph would have made the slightest difference.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we conclude, without serious question, that the district court neither applied an incorrect legal standard nor abused its discretion in denying the defendant's motion for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Although the parking spaces were not numbered, we refer to this location, for ease of exposition, as \"parking space two.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Bladuell approximated the distance between these two points at 165 feet.

We nonetheless adjudged these sets of rules \"equivalent.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The motion papers are silent as to when the defendant actually learned of this evidence. That fact alone runs up a red flag because it leaves open the possibility that the defense was contacted by Alicea-Aponte or her supervisor during the trial<i>Cf. Alicea,</i> 205 F.3d at 487 (finding unpersuasive claim of newly discovered evidence where \"appellant's motion papers said nothing about when or how he had learned of [it]\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In this regard, it bears mentioning that the defendant did not seek a continuance after M&#233;ndez completed her direct examination</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The defendant strives to persuade us that the Cort&#233;s photograph strikes at the heart of M&#233;ndez's veracity. He reasons that if the junked green van was in fact parked both in parking space two and to M&#233;ndez's right, there would have been no room for the black car that M&#233;ndez recalled being parked to her left. We are not convinced. Fairly viewed, the Cort&#233;s photograph &#8212; even if the scene that it depicts existed on July 14 (more than two months earlier) &#8212; does not preclude the presence of another vehicle being parked, if haphazardly, to her left</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
