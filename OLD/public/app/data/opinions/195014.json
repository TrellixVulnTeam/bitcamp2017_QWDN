Claimant  Luis Sanchez-Quiles  appeals from  a\n               \n\ndistrict  court  judgment  which  affirms  the  decision  of  the\n\nSecretary  of Health  and Human  Services denying  his  claim for\n\nsocial security  disability benefits  during  the insured  period\n\nbetween July  2, 1971  and December 31,  1974.   Claimant alleges\n\nthat he suffered from severe back,  heart, and mental impairments\n\nduring that time period.      We  have  thoroughly  reviewed  the\n\nrecord and the  parties' briefs on appeal and  are persuaded that\n\nthe  Secretary's decision is  supported by  substantial evidence.\n\nClaimant's contention that  the combination  of his back,  heart,\n\nand  mental  impairments  was,  in  essence,  equivalent  to  the\n\nlistings for vertebrogenic, heart,  and somatoform disorders,  is\n\nmeritless.  Findings  of  medical equivalence  must  be  based on\n\n\"medical  findings that  are  at  least  equal  in  severity  and\n\nduration  to  the   listed  findings.\"    20   C.F.R.   404.1526.\n\nClaimant's  alleged  impairments  are  not  supported by  medical\n\nfindings   from  the   insured   period  that   approximate   the\n\naforementioned listings in severity or duration.\n\n     Claimant's  contention  that  the ALJ  erred  by  failing to\n\nevaluate  his  pain   as  a  nonexertional  impairment   also  is\n\nunavailing.  To be sure, \"[p]ain may be a nonexertional factor to\n\nbe considered in  combination with  exertional limitations,  even\n\nthough it may also serve as a separate and independent ground for\n\ndisability.\" Da Rosa v.  Secretary of Health and  Human Services,\n                                                                \n\n803  F.2d 24,  26 (1st  Cir. 1986)(per curiam).   \"Where  pain is\n\nconsidered as  a separate  ground for disability  ... it  must be\n\nsevere  enough to  prevent  the  claimant  from engaging  in  any\n                                                                 \n\nsubstantial  gainful  employment.  Where pain  is  considered  in\n\n                                2\n\ncombination with exertional limitations, however, it need only be\n\nfound significant enough to prevent the claimant from engaging in\n\nthe full range  of jobs contemplated  by the exertional  category\n\nfor which the claimant otherwise qualifies.\"  Gagnon v. Secretary\n                                                                 \n\nof Health and  Human Services, 666 F.2d  662, 666 n. 8  (1st Cir.\n                             \n\n1981).\n\n     The  ALJ  found  that  claimant's  complaints of  pain  were\n\ncredible only to  the extent that they  precluded the performance\n\nof more  than sedentary  work  because (1)  the medical  evidence\n\nconcerning his  back impairment, particularly  Dr. Arturo Feria's\n\nreport, disclosed a full  range of motion,  little in the way  of\n\npositive clinical findings, and an inability to \"work hard, carry\n\nlight weights, and climb scaffolds  and stairs,\" (2) the  medical\n\nevidence disclosed no  objective basis for claimant's  chest pain\n\ncomplaints, since his  myocardial infarction did not  occur until\n\nJune 1975, and a \"careful study\" of progress notes indicated that\n\nclaimant's  pain  was  \"occasional,\"  (3)  claimant's  activities\n\nduring the insured period, which  included multiple trips between\n\nthe United States and Puerto  Rico, and claimant's testimony that\n\nhe experienced at  least some relief with  medications, indicated\n\nthat claimant's pain allegations were not fully credible.\n\n     It  is  true  that  the  ALJ  did   not  explicitly  address\n\nclaimant's pain as a nonexertional  limitation.  Nevertheless, we\n\nthink  his  decision   implies  that  claimant's  pain   did  not\n\nsignificantly  reduce his access  to jobs at  the sedentary level\n\nand thus did  not preclude reliance on the grid.1   So construed,\n\n                    \n\n     1  Where \"a nonexertional limitation ...[is] found to impose\nno significant  restriction on  the range of  work a  claimant is\nexertionally  able to  perform,  reliance  on  the  Grid  remains\n\n                                3\n\nthe ALJ's  decision is  supportable.   The record  indicates that\n\nclaimant sought  treatment for back  pain on  only two  occasions\n\n(August and  November)  in  1971 and  two  occasions  (March  and\n\nSeptember) in  1972.  There  appears to  be a significant  gap in\n\ntreatment between  September 1972  and August  1983.2   The  1974\n\nrecords indicate  that claimant sought treatment  more frequently\n\nbut  not so  much  as to  suggest the  presence  of a  continuous\n\nimpairment.  In short, the  AlJ's conclusion that claimant's pain\n\nwas  \"occasional\"  appears  to  be   correct.3    The  claimant's\n\ndescription of  his daily  activities (which  noted that  he took\n\ncare of the  house, wife and children and  could drive), the fact\n\nthat he could travel, and  his admission that he experienced some\n\nrelief with medication all tend  to support the ALJ's  conclusion\n\nthat the  sedentary work base  was essentially intact  during the\n\ninsured period.                          \n\n     Thus, claimant's contention that the ALJ erred by failing to\n\nconsider his pain as a nonexertional limitation ultimately fails.\n\n                    \n\nappropriate.\"   Ortiz v. Secretary  of Health and Human Services,\n                                                                \n890 F.2d 520, 524 (1st Cir. 1989)(per curiam). \n\n     2We  note that some of the records  that the ALJ relied upon\nare not  in the record  before us,  thus this gap  may not be  as\nsignificant as the  record presently suggests.   But claimant has\nnot  pointed  out any  records which  suggest that  his condition\nbecame more dire during  this period.  Nor has  he challenged the\nALJ's description of  the missing records.  Accordingly,  we have\nassumed that the ALJ's description is correct.   \n\n     3The  ALJ might be  faulted for discounting  the evidence of\nclaimant's  chest  pain   on  the  ground  that   his  myocardial\ninfarction did not  happen until 1975.  The  record suggests that\nclaimant may  have received  treatment for  a heart  condition as\nearly as January-February  1975.  (Tr. 291-92, 323-24).   Even if\nhe did not, common sense suggests that claimant's  ischemic heart\ndisease  did not  appear overnight,  and  that at  least some  of\nclaimant's complaints of chest pain during the insured period may\nhave resulted from  his heart condition.  But the record does not\nshow that this pain was disabling during that time.  \n\n                                4\n\nThe  ALJ's  decision implies  that  claimant's  pain was  not  so\n\npersistent or  severe as  to significantly  reduce the  sedentary\n\noccupational  base.    Even  if  the ALJ's  decision  is  not  so\n\nconstrued, there  is no error  in failing  to consider pain  as a\n\nnonexertional impairment where an  ALJ reasonably discredits  the\n\nclaimant's testimony  concerning the limitations imposed  by back\n\npain  and other  restrictions.   See  Frustaglia v.  Secretary of\n                                                                 \n\nHealth and Human Services, 829  F.2d 192, 195 (1st Cir. 1987)(per\n                         \n\ncuriam).  Thus,  we may conclude that  there was no error  in the\n\nALJ's assessment of the disabling effects of claimant's pain.\n\n     Claimant also  faults the ALJ  for failing  to consider  his\n\nmental impairment as a possible  explanation for his pain, and in\n\napplying   the  grid   despite  the   presence  of   significant,\n\nnonexertional  pain  and  mental impairments.    We  have already\n\naddressed the claimant's  pain.  The sole evidence  in the record\n\nconcerning an alleged mental impairment during the insured period\n\nstates simply \"[rule  out] psychosomatic  disorder.\"  (Tr.  222).\n\nThis  is  plainly insufficient  to  establish the  presence  of a\n\nmental  impairment   that  was   significant  enough  to   impede\n\nclaimant's access to the sedentary occupational base.   While the\n\nrecord includes more frequent references  to anxiety and neurosis\n\nafter claimant's myocardial infarction was  diagnosed in 1975, it\n\nwas the claimant's burden to prove that he became disabled before\n\nhis  insured status  expired.

Claimant's alleged impairments are not supported by medical findings from the insured period that approximate the aforementioned listings in severity or duration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant's contention that the ALJ erred by failing to evaluate his pain as a nonexertional impairment also is unavailing.  To be sure, \"[p]ain may be a nonexertional factor to be considered in combination with exertional limitations, even though it may also serve as a separate and independent ground for disability.\"   Da Rosa v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"477961\"><a href=\"/opinion/477961/15-socsecrepser-223-unemplinsrep-cch-17067-raymond-r-da-rosa-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">803</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 26 (1st Cir. 1986)(per curiam).  \"Where pain is considered as a separate ground for disability ... it must be severe enough to prevent the claimant from engaging in any substantial gainful employment.  Where pain is considered in combination with exertional limitations, however, it need only be found significant enough to prevent the claimant from engaging in the full range of jobs contemplated by the exertional category for which the claimant otherwise qualifies.\"   Gagnon v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"398008\"><a href=\"/opinion/398008/roger-gagnon-v-secretary-of-health-and-human-services/\"><span class=\"volume\">666</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span>, 666 n. 8 (1st Cir. 1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ALJ found that claimant's complaints of pain were credible only to the extent that they precluded the performance of more than sedentary work because (1) the medical evidence concerning his back impairment, particularly Dr. Arturo Feria's report, disclosed a full range of motion, little in the way of positive clinical findings, and an inability to \"work hard, carry light weights, and climb scaffolds and stairs,\" (2) the medical evidence disclosed no objective basis for claimant's chest pain complaints, since his myocardial infarction did not occur until June 1975, and a \"careful study\" of progress notes indicated that claimant's pain was \"occasional,\" (3) claimant's activities during the insured period, which included multiple trips between the United States and Puerto Rico, and claimant's testimony that he experienced at least some relief with medications, indicated that claimant's pain allegations were not fully credible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that the ALJ did not explicitly address claimant's pain as a nonexertional limitation.  Nevertheless, we think his decision implies that claimant's pain did not significantly reduce his access to jobs at the sedentary level and thus did not preclude reliance on the grid.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  So construed, the ALJ's decision is supportable.  The record indicates that claimant sought treatment for back pain on only two occasions (August and November) in 1971 and two occasions (March and September) in 1972.  There appears to be a significant gap in treatment between September 1972 and August 1983.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a>  The 1974 records indicate that claimant sought treatment more frequently but not so much as to suggest the presence of a continuous impairment.  In short, the ALJ's conclusion that claimant's pain was \"occasional\" appears to be correct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  The claimant's description of his daily activities (which noted that he took care of the house, wife and children and could drive), the fact that he could travel, and his admission that he experienced some relief with medication all tend to support the ALJ's conclusion that the sedentary work base was essentially intact during the insured period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, claimant's contention that the ALJ erred by failing to consider his pain as a nonexertional limitation ultimately fails.  The ALJ's decision implies that claimant's pain was not so persistent or severe as to significantly reduce the sedentary occupational base.  Even if the ALJ's decision is not so construed, there is no error in failing to consider pain as a nonexertional impairment where an ALJ reasonably discredits the claimant's testimony concerning the limitations imposed by back pain and other restrictions.   See Frustaglia v. Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"494588\"><a href=\"/opinion/494588/19-socsecrepser-60-unemplinsrep-cch-17576-joseph-t-frustaglia-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">829</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">192</span></a></span>, 195 (1st Cir. 1987)(per curiam).  Thus, we may conclude that there was no error in the ALJ's assessment of the disabling effects of claimant's pain.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Claimant also faults the ALJ for failing to consider his mental impairment as a possible explanation for his pain, and in applying the grid despite the presence of significant, nonexertional pain and mental impairments.  We have already addressed the claimant's pain.  The sole evidence in the record concerning an alleged mental impairment during the insured period states simply \"[rule out] psychosomatic disorder.\"  (Tr. 222).  This is plainly insufficient to establish the presence of a mental impairment that was significant enough to impede claimant's access to the sedentary occupational base.  While the record includes more frequent references to anxiety and neurosis after claimant's myocardial infarction was diagnosed in 1975, it was the claimant's burden to prove that he became disabled before his insured status expired.

Secretary of Health and Human Services, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"532750\"><a href=\"/opinion/532750/28-socsecrepser-3-unemplinsrep-cch-15109a-victor-m-ortiz-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">890</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">520</span></a></span>, 524 (1st Cir. 1989)(per curiam)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We note that some of the records that the ALJ relied upon are not in the record before us, thus this gap may not be as significant as the record presently suggests.  But claimant has not pointed out any records which suggest that his condition became more dire during this period.  Nor has he challenged the ALJ's description of the missing records.  Accordingly, we have assumed that the ALJ's description is correct</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The ALJ might be faulted for discounting the evidence of claimant's chest pain on the ground that his myocardial infarction did not happen until 1975.  The record suggests that claimant may have received treatment for a heart condition as early as January-February 1975.  (Tr. 291-92, 323-24).  Even if he did not, common sense suggests that claimant's ischemic heart disease did not appear overnight, and that at least some of claimant's complaints of chest pain during the insured period may have resulted from his heart condition.  But the record does not show that this pain was disabling during that time</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
