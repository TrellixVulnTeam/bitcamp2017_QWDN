Kenworthy, Alan I. Horowitz, and Miller & Chevalier\nChartered, Attorneys for Financial Executives International, as\namicus curiae in support of Textron Inc.\n\n\n\n\n                        January 21, 2009\n\n\n\n\n                               -2-\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. The question presented by this\n\nappeal is whether the work-product doctrine protects documents\n\nprepared by Textron Inc. for the purpose of calculating tax reserve\n\nliability from production to the IRS pursuant to an investigative\n\nsubpoena.     Like other companies, Textron prepares \"tax accrual\n\nworkpapers\"    which,     generally   speaking,      list    the   questionable\n\npositions Textron took on its tax returns, estimate the likelihood\n\nthat those positions will not withstand scrutiny, and calculate the\n\namount of additional tax liability that would result from revision\n\nof those positions.       Textron prepares these estimates so that it\n\ncan maintain an adequate reserve fund, properly report its assets\n\nand   liabilities,   and    obtain    independent     certification     of   its\n\nfinancial statements.        As part of the auditing process, Textron\n\nshowed these tax accrual workpapers to Ernst & Young (\"E&Y\") an\n\nindependent auditor.\n\n            This   case    arose   when     the   Internal   Revenue   Service\n\n(\"IRS\"), after noticing potential tax shelter transactions, issued\n\nan administrative summons to Textron pursuant to I.R.C. ยง 7602\n\nseeking tax accrual workpapers for Textron's 2001 tax returns.\n\nTextron refused to comply and asserted a number of defenses.                 The\n\nIRS sued to enforce the subpoena.            After an evidentiary hearing,\n\nthe district court ruled for Textron on its work-product protection\n\nclaim, but rejected its other defenses.             The district court also\n\nfound that Textron's disclosure to E&Y did not constitute waiver.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fThe IRS appeals.    After careful review,1 we affirm in part, vacate\n\nin part, and remand.\n\n                             I.    Background\n\n          The IRS subpoena sought \"Tax Accrual Workpapers,\" defined\n\nas:\n\n          [A]11 accrual and other financial workpapers\n          or documents created or assembled by the\n          Taxpayer, an accountant for the Taxpayer, or\n          the Taxpayer's independent auditor relating to\n          any tax reserve for current, deferred, and\n          potential or contingent tax liabilities,\n          however classified or reported on audited\n          financial statements, and to any footnotes\n          disclosing reserves or contingent liabilities\n          on audited financial statements. They include,\n          but are not limited to, any and all analyses,\n          computations, opinions, notes, summaries,\n          discussions, and other documents relating to\n          such reserves and any footnotes.\n\nThe subpoena sought all documents in the actual or constructive\n\npossession, custody, or control of Textron or its accountants. The\n\ndistrict court held oral arguments where the government reiterated\n\nthat it was seeking tax accrual documents prepared by Textron or\n\nE&Y.   Textron     argued   that   it   had   created   the   documents   in\n\nanticipation of a dispute with the IRS regarding its tax returns.\n\n\n\n1\n   Textron was joined by amici curiae Committee on Taxation and\nCommittee   on  Corporate   Reporting   of   Financial   Executives\nInternational, Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America,\nand Association of Corporate Counsel. The IRS has submitted two\nscholarly articles which we have considered: Dennis J. Ventry, Jr.,\nProtecting Abusive Tax Avoidance, 120 Tax Notes 857 (2008); and\nClaudine Pease-Wingenter, The Application of the Attorney-Client\nPrivilege to Tax Accrual Workpapers: The Real Legacy of United\nStates v. Textron, 8 Houston Bus. & Tax L.J. 337 (2008).\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            The district court then held an evidentiary hearing on\n\nthe types of documents included in the definition of \"tax accrual\n\nworkpapers\" and the basis for Textron's work product claim. At the\n\nevidentiary hearing, the IRS's expert witness, Professor Douglas\n\nCarmichael, testified that securities law requires that public\n\ncompanies obtain a letter from an independent auditor approving the\n\ncompany's financial statements, and that part of that audit was an\n\nanalysis    of   the    company's       reserves      for    covering       tax   loss.\n\nTextron's   former     Director       of   Tax     Reporting,     Roxanne    Cassidy,\n\ncountered   that     the      tax    accrual      workpapers      were   created    \"to\n\ndetermine whether Textron was adequately reserved with respect to\n\nany potential disputes or litigations that would happen in the\n\nfuture.\" Cassidy and Norman Richter, Textron tax counsel, explained\n\nthat the tax accrual workpapers listed positions Textron was taking\n\non its tax returns that might require that a reserve be set aside.\n\nThese   positions      were    then    analyzed      by    Textron   attorneys      who\n\nestimated a percentage likelihood that the position would not\n\nprevail if challenged by the IRS.                Textron calls this the \"hazards\n\nof litigation percentage.\"            The reserve requirement was calculated\n\nby multiplying this percentage times the tax benefit claimed.\n\n            In   response,          Carmichael,      the    IRS    expert     witness,\n\ncontended that public companies prepare these papers every year to\n\ncomply with securities law regardless of whether they expect\n\nlitigation. But, Richter testified that the tax accrual workpapers\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fwere prepared under the assumption that issues identified would be\n\nchallenged by the IRS and would need to be defended.                   He further\n\ntestified that if Textron did not anticipate any disputes, the tax\n\naccrual workpapers would be blank. The IRS disagreed, arguing that\n\nsome workpapers would nevertheless be necessary to handle deferred\n\ntaxes or to justify setting aside no tax reserve.\n\n              It was undisputed that the IRS audits every Textron\n\nreturn in multi-year cycles.          Testimony also showed that in each\n\naudit cycle hundreds of IRS adjustments to Textron's returns were\n\nsimply accepted by Textron.       Where Textron and the IRS do dispute\n\ntax liability, their dispute could be resolved through a conference\n\nwith the audit team, by presentation of arguments to the IRS Office\n\nof Appeals, or, ultimately, federal court litigation.                 In seven of\n\nthe last eight audit cycles, Textron and the IRS have brought at\n\nleast one issue to the IRS Office of Appeals.                 Between 1959 and\n\npresent, Textron and the IRS have litigated three disputes in\n\nfederal court.        Textron admitted that it expected to concede\n\nseveral   issues     identified   in    the     workpapers,     and     that   the\n\npercentage     for   those   issues    was    listed   as    \"100%.\"      Textron\n\nexplained that those items were due to instances where legal\n\ndevelopments rendered a prior position undefendable.\n\n              IRS agents explained that access to the workpapers would\n\nhelp   them    navigate   Textron's    4000    page    tax   return    which   was\n\naccompanied by \"9 four-drawer file cabinets\" of paper.                   The IRS\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fwitnesses explained that the tax accrual workpapers would help the\n\nIRS understand the substance of a transaction and could help the\n\nIRS identify potential issues with Textron's return.                 An agent\n\ntestified that in 2006 the IRS adopted the policy of seeking tax\n\naccrual workpapers when the audit team becomes aware (sometime\n\nthrough self-reporting) of certain transactions by the taxpayer\n\nwhich potentially constitute abusive tax shelters.\n\n           As to the waiver issue, the IRS's expert, Carmichael,\n\ntestified that companies create these tax accrual workpapers,\n\nknowing that they will be shared with an auditor.               Evidence also\n\nshowed that the auditor's code of ethics requires information be\n\nkept confidential unless required to be produced in response to a\n\nsubpoena or other legal obligation. Mark Weston, a partner at E&Y,\n\nsubmitted an affidavit explaining these confidentiality obligations\n\nand   further   stating   that   E&Y    had   not   in   fact   disclosed   any\n\ninformation regarding Textron's 2001 tax accrual computations. But\n\nthe IRS expert opined that auditors ultimately owe an allegiance to\n\nthe investing public and have legal obligations of disclosure in\n\nsome instances.\n\n           Textron countered that it let E&Y look at its tax accrual\n\nworkpapers, but did not allow E&Y to retain a copy of them.             Debra\n\nRaymond, a Textron tax manager, averred that she had reviewed E&Y's\n\nfiles and that E&Y did not in fact retain a copy of Textron's\n\nworkpapers.\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f          The IRS subpoena also requested any tax-accrual documents\n\nprepared by E&Y regarding Textron.        After the evidentiary hearing,\n\nthe district court found that the \"tax accrual workpapers\" at issue\n\ndid not include facts about the issues they identified, and could\n\nbe described as follows:\n\n          1. A spreadsheet that contains:\n          (a) lists of items on Textron's tax returns,\n          which, in the opinion of Textron's counsel,\n          involve issues on which the tax laws are\n          unclear, and, therefore, may be challenged by\n          the IRS;\n          (b) estimates by Textron's counsel expressing,\n          in percentage terms, their judgments regarding\n          Textron's chances of prevailing in any\n          litigation over those issues (the \"hazards of\n          litigation percentages\"); and\n          (c) the dollar amounts reserved to reflect the\n          possibility that Textron might not prevail in\n          such litigation (the \"tax reserve amounts\").\n\n          2. Backup workpapers consisting of the\n          previous year's spreadsheet and earlier drafts\n          of the spreadsheet together with notes and\n          memoranda written by Textron's in-house tax\n          attorneys reflecting their opinions as to\n          which items should be included on the\n          spreadsheet and the hazard of litigation\n          percentage that should apply to each item.\n\nUnited States v. Textron Inc., 507 F. Supp. 2d 138, 142-143 (D.R.I.\n\n2007).   The government objects on appeal that the district court\n\ndid not include in this definition any tax accrual workpaper that\n\nE&Y prepared in its audit of Textron.\n\n          The   district   court   then    found   that   the   subpoenaed\n\ndocuments were relevant, requested for a proper purpose, and were\n\nprivileged attorney-client communications.         Id. at 143-48.    But,\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fthe district court found that the attorney-client privilege was\n\nwaived by disclosure to E&Y.   Id. at 151-52.\n\n          As to the work-product protection claim, the district\n\ncourt credited Textron's testimony that its ultimate purpose in\n\npreparing the tax accrual workpapers was to ensure that it was\n\n\"'adequately reserved with respect to any potential disputes or\n\nlitigation that would happen in the future.'\"       Id. at 143 (quoting\n\nthe testimony of Norman Richter). The court found that this desire\n\nto ensure adequate reserves was also prompted, in part, by its wish\n\nto satisfy independent auditors that Textron had properly reported\n\nits financial information. Id. at 150. The court acknowledged the\n\nFirst Circuit's \"because of\" test for determining whether documents\n\nwere prepared in anticipation of litigation and recognized that\n\nunder that test there is no protection for \"'documents that are\n\nprepared in the ordinary course of business or that would have been\n\ncreated   in   essentially   similar   form    irrespective    of   the\n\nlitigation.'\" Id. (quoting Maine v. United States Dep't of the\n\nInterior, 298 F.3d 60, 70 (1st Cir. 2002)).         The district court\n\nthen held that the tax accrual workpapers \"would not have been\n\nprepared at all 'but for' the fact that Textron anticipated the\n\npossibility of litigation with the IRS.\"      Id.   The district court\n\nreasoned that while the papers were used to obtain a favorable\n\nopinion letter from E&Y regarding Textron's reserves, there would\n\nhave been no need for such reserves \"if Textron had not anticipated\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fa dispute with the IRS that was likely to result in litigation or\n\nsome other adversarial proceeding.\"               Id.    The IRS appeals the\n\nconclusion that the work-product doctrine protects the tax accrual\n\nworkpapers.\n\n            The district court then noted that the standard for\n\nwaiver of the work-product protection was different than for\n\nattorney-client     privilege.    Id.        at   152.    The   district   court\n\nconcluded that disclosure of Textron's tax accrual workpapers to\n\nE&Y did not effect a waiver since disclosure \"did not substantially\n\nincrease the IRS's opportunity to obtain the information contained\n\nin them.\"      Id. at 153.   The district court based its decision on\n\nE&Y's professional confidentiality obligations and the fact that\n\nE&Y averred that it had not actually disclosed the information.\n\nId.2    The IRS also appeals this conclusion.\n\n            The district court then ruled that the government could\n\nnot make the showing needed to overcome work-product protection\n\nsince    the    government   sought     Textron's        \"mental   impressions,\n\nconclusions, opinions or legal theories.\"                Id. at 154 (internal\n\nquotations omitted).     The IRS does not appeal this conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n2\n   The district court also found that E&Y had promised to keep the\ndocuments confidential. The IRS contends that this fact is not\nsupported in the record.    As explained infra n.9, we need not\ndecide this dispute.\n\n                                      -10-\n\f                               II.    Discussion\n\n           Three issues are thus presented for appeal: (1) whether\n\nthe   work-product     doctrine      protects   Textron's   workpapers;   (2)\n\nwhether   any   such      work-product   protection   was   waived   through\n\ndisclosure to E&Y; and (3) whether the district court erred in not\n\nconsidering the IRS's request for E&Y's workpapers.\n\n           On these evidentiary issues, we \"review district court\n\nrulings on questions of law de novo; we review district court fact\n\nfindings for clear error; and we review 'discretionary judgments\n\nsuch as evidentiary rulings' for abuse of discretion.\"            Cavallaro\n\nv. United States, 284 F.3d 236, 245 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Mass. Inst. of Tech. (\"MIT\"), 129 F.3d 681, 683 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)).\n\n           \"[T]he party who invokes the privilege bears the burden\n\nof establishing that it applies to the communications at issue and\n\nthat it has not been waived.\"         XYZ Corp. v. United States, 348 F.3d\n\n16, 22 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           A.   Work-Product Protection\n\n                     1.    Applicable law\n\n           \"[T]he work-product doctrine does apply in tax summons\n\nenforcement proceedings.\"         Upjohn Co. v. United States, 449 U.S.\n\n383, 386 (1981). The work-product doctrine protects \"documents and\n\ntangible things that are prepared in anticipation of litigation or\n\nfor trial by or for another party or its representative.\"            Fed. R.\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fCiv. P. 26(b)(3)(A).     In assessing whether a document was prepared\n\nin anticipation of litigation, this circuit uses the \"because of\"\n\ntest.     Maine, 298 F.3d at 68.      Under this test, a document is\n\nprotected \"if, 'in light of the nature of the document and the\n\nfactual situation in the particular case, the document can be\n\nfairly said to have been prepared or obtained because of the\n\nprospect of litigation.'\"        Id. at 70 (quoting United States v.\n\nAdlman, 134 F.3d 1194, 1202 (2d Cir. 1998)) (emphasis in original).\n\nIt is also our law that, \"the 'because of' standard does not\n\nprotect   from    disclosure   'documents   that   are   prepared   in   the\n\nordinary course of business or that would have been created in\n\nessentially similar form irrespective of the litigation.'\" Id.\n\n(quoting Adlman, 134 F.3d at 1202).       As discussed below, we hold in\n\nthis case that the presence of a business purpose does not defeat\n\nwork-product protection.\n\n            The   work-product   doctrine   originates    in   Hickman   v.\n\nTaylor, where the Supreme Court laid out the problems with allowing\n\nthe discovery of work product:\n\n            Were such materials open to opposing counsel\n            on mere demand, much of what is now put down\n            in   writing   would   remain  unwritten.   An\n            attorney's thoughts, heretofore inviolate,\n            would not be his own. Inefficiency, unfairness\n            and sharp practices would inevitably develop\n            in the giving of legal advice and in the\n            preparation of cases for trial. The effect on\n            the legal profession would be demoralizing.\n            And the interests of the clients and the cause\n            of justice would be poorly served.\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fHickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 511 (1947).         The doctrine is\n\nrightly seen as a protection for the adversary system, not simply\n\nthe attorney.   Coastal States Gas Corp. v. Department of Energy,\n\n617 F.2d 854, 864 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (noting the doctrine does not\n\nprotect all documents prepared by a lawyer and instead \"focuses on\n\nthe integrity of the adversary trial process itself\" (quotation\n\nomitted)).\n\n          The Restatement has offered a definition of litigation in\n\nthe work product context:\n\n          \"Litigation\" includes civil and criminal trial\n          proceedings,    as    well   as    adversarial\n          proceedings before an administrative agency,\n          an arbitration panel or a claims commission,\n          and     alternative-dispute-resolution\n          proceedings such as mediation or mini-trial.\n          It also includes a proceeding such as a grand\n          jury   or    a   coroner's   inquiry   or   an\n          investigative legislative hearing. In general,\n          a proceeding is adversarial when evidence or\n          legal argument is presented by parties\n          contending against each other with respect to\n          legally significant factual issues.\n\nRestatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers ยง 87 cmt. h\n\n(2000).   \"'Adversarialness' is the touchstone of this approach to\n\nthe 'litigation' question . . . .\"     In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 220\n\nF.R.D. 130, 147 (D. Mass. 2004).\n\n                  2.   Are tax disputes \"litigation?\"\n\n          The IRS argues that preparation of tax returns is not\n\nmeant to be an adversary process, but rather is a self-reporting\n\nregime that relies on the good faith of taxpayers.    The IRS reasons\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fthat it is not seeking to gain unfair litigation advantage but\n\nrather to verify self-assessment in an environment where the\n\ntaxpayer holds all the relevant information. Textron responds that\n\nit routinely engages in administrative disputes and even federal\n\ncourt litigation with the IRS.\n\n           Citing Roxworthy, Textron argues that anticipation of\n\naudit disputes can constitute anticipation of litigation.             United\n\nStates v. Roxworthy, 457 F.3d 590, 600-01 (6th Cir. 2006) (finding\n\nmemos prepared analyzing legal arguments supporting and opposing\n\nspecific   tax   positions   to   be   protected   work   product).       But,\n\nRoxworthy cites another case, Hodges, for the proposition that \"a\n\ndocument prepared 'in anticipation of dealing with the IRS . . .\n\nmay well have been prepared in anticipation of an administrative\n\ndispute and this may constitute litigation within the meaning of\n\nRule 26.'\"   Id. at 600 (quoting Hodges, Grant & Kaufmann v. IRS,\n\n768 F.2d 719, 719-22 (5th Cir. 1985)) (emphasis added).               Hodges,\n\nhowever, was not expressing a holding, but simply remanding to the\n\ndistrict court to consider a work-product claim.          Considering that\n\nRoxworthy dealt with anticipation of litigation with respect to\n\nspecific   transactions,     Roxworthy    does   not   establish   that    all\n\ndocuments prepared analyzing tax returns are protected.            Instead,\n\nRoxworthy holds that documents created to analyze specific areas of\n\nlikely dispute may be protected.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f           Nonetheless, after considering the applicable test, we\n\nconclude that, while not all \"dealing with the IRS\" during an audit\n\nis \"litigation,\" the resolution of disputes through adversary\n\nadministrative processes, including proceedings before the IRS\n\nAppeals Board, meets the definition of litigation.                The IRS is\n\ncorrect that preparation and filing of returns relies on good faith\n\nself-reporting.       But, good-faith disputes regarding the proper\n\napplication of tax law also arise during the audit process.            Thus,\n\nthough the initial processing of these disputes in the audit\n\nprocess   may   not    be    adversarial,    the   disputes   themselves   are\n\nessentially adversarial; the subject of these disputes will become\n\nthe subject of litigation unless the dispute is resolved.3\n\n                      3.    Were the tax accrual workpapers prepared in\n                             anticipation of litigation?\n\n           In addition to the question of whether audit disputes\n\nwith the IRS are litigation, we must confront the question of\n\nwhether   Textron's         tax   accrual    workpapers   are   prepared    in\n\nanticipation of such disputes.          The district court reasoned that\n\nthe business need to cover potential liabilities arose out of the\n\nanticipation of potential disputes, and thus would not occur \"but\n\n\n3\n  Thus, we do not hold that filing tax returns or participating in\naudits is itself adversarial. Our holding does not and should not\nchange the essentiality of good faith self-assessment. The IRS\nretains many enforcement tools to ensure compliance with that\nsystem. Thus, we do not share in the IRS's negative conclusions\nabout the policy effects of our judgment, which concerns tax\naccrual workpapers, documents which the IRS admits it seeks only in\nlimited circumstances.\n\n                                      -15-\n\ffor\" those disputes.          Textron, 507 F. Supp. 2d at 150.              The IRS\n\nargues that the district court's conclusion is factually and\n\nlegally wrong.\n\n                              a.   Analysis\n\n             The IRS argues that, as a legal matter, the documents\n\nwere not prepared in anticipation of litigation and that the\n\ndistrict court misapplied the \"because of\" test when it reasoned\n\nthat the documents would not have been created \"but for\" the\n\nprospect of litigation.\n\n             We agree with the district court's finding that one of\n\nthe purposes behind the creation of the documents was anticipation\n\nof litigation.         As the district court explained, the need to\n\nestimate the likelihood of success in litigation was a result of\n\nthe need to set up a reserve fund to cover tax positions for which\n\nTextron could foresee disputes with the IRS.\n\n             Of course, simple relation to litigation is insufficient\n\nto    trigger   work-product         protection.    Maine,    298    F.3d    at   69.\n\nFurther, work-product protection must be assessed in reference to\n\na    \"the   function   that    the    document     serves,\"   not    its    content.\n\nRoxworthy, 457 F.3d at 595.           And it is not enough that the preparer\n\n\"had the prospect of litigation in mind when it\" created the\n\ndocuments.      Adlman, 134 F.3d at 1204.            Rather, the \"because of\"\n\ntest    \"really   turns   on       whether    it   would   have     been    prepared\n\nirrespective of the expected litigation with the IRS.\"                     Id.\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\f            But, here, the function of the documents was to analyze\n\nlitigation for the purpose of creating and auditing a reserve fund.\n\nIt   can   be   fairly    said   that    \"'the   driving   force   behind   the\n\npreparation'\" of the documents, Roxworthy, 457 F.3d at 595 (quoting\n\nNat'l Union Fire Ins. Co. v. Murray Sheet Metal Co., 967 F.2d 980,\n\n984 (4th Cir. 1992)), was the need to reserve money in anticipation\n\nof disputes with the IRS.        The district court so found, and we find\n\nno clear error.          See Cavallaro, 284 F.3d at 245 (clear error\n\nstandard applied to findings of fact of district court in privilege\n\ncase).4    In this way, we read the district court's \"but for\"\n\n\n\n4\n   The dissent challenges this factual conclusion of the district\ncourt, but utterly fails to explain why the district court's\nacceptance of the testimony of Textron's witnesses was clear error.\nSpecifically, the district court found that Textron would have no\nneed to compute reserves if it had not anticipated litigation.\nTextron, 507 F. Supp. 2d at 150 (recognizing that though \"it may be\naccurate to say that the workpapers helped Textron determine what\namount should be reserved to cover any potential tax liabilities,\"\nanticipation of disputes drove that very need). Contrary to the\ndissent's intimations, the district court did find that Textron's\ntax accrual workpapers were prepared with dual purposes in mind.\nId. at 143 (finding Textron's \"ultimate purpose\" in preparing the\nworkpapers was to ensure Textron was adequately reserved with\nrespect to disputes or potential litigation, but acknowledging that\nthe desire to establish adequate reserves \"also was prompted, in\npart, by its wish to satisfy an independent auditor\" and obtain a\nclean opinion).    These findings were based on testimony from\nTextron's witnesses. The testimony of the government's expert,\ncited by the dissent, does not contradict the conclusion that\nTextron was motivated by dual purposes, especially considering that\nit is not clear that the expert is using the same definition of\n\"anticipation of litigation\" that we adopt. See infra. Thus, the\ndistrict court's fact finding was not clearly erroneous. Rather,\nit is accurate to say that Textron's tax accrual workpapers would\nnot have been prepared in a similar form irrespective of the\npotential for litigation.\n\n                                        -17-\n\freasoning as a way of expressing its conclusion that the documents\n\nwould not have been prepared irrespective of the prospect of\n\nlitigation, but rather were prepared \"because of\" the risk of\n\ndisputes and litigation which gave rise to a need to compute and\n\nreport tax reserves.5\n\n           The IRS next argues that the district court found that\n\nthe \"workpapers helped Textron determine what amount should be\n\nreserved to cover any potential tax liabilities and that the\n\nworkpapers were useful in obtaining a 'clean' opinion from E&Y\n\nregarding the adequacy of the reserve amount.\"             Textron, 507 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 150.    The IRS argues that this finding legally compels\n\na ruling that the tax accrual workpapers are not protected, since\n\ndocuments prepared in the ordinary course of business receive no\n\nprotection.     Maine, 298 F.3d at 70.   The IRS further reasons that\n\nsince the documents were required to comply with reporting and\n\nsecurities obligations, the tax accrual workpapers were prepared\n\npursuant   to    \"regulatory   requirements\"   and   are    therefore   not\n\nprotected.      See Nat'l Union, 967 F.2d at 984.          The IRS reasons\n\nthat, as a simple matter of law, Rule 26 does not apply to\n\n\n\n5\n   The IRS also argues that some form of workpaper would have been\nprepared even if no disputes were anticipated in order to justify\nsetting aside no reserve. But that is not the context in which the\nworkpapers at issue in this case were created.        Rather, the\nevidence shows that these workpapers project the risks of\nlitigation over specific tax positions and were created in the\ncontext   of   anticipating  disputes   (and  therefore   possible\nlitigation) over those positions.\n\n                                  -18-\n\f\"[m]aterials assembled in the ordinary course of business, or\n\npursuant to public requirements unrelated to litigation, or for\n\nother nonlitigation purposes.\"              Fed. R. Civ. P. 26 Notes of\n\nAdvisory Committee on 1970 amendments.\n\n             We reject the IRS's contention that the mere presence of\n\na business or regulatory purpose defeats work-product protection.\n\nTo be sure, \"there is no work-product immunity for documents\n\nprepared in the regular course of business rather than for purposes\n\nof    the   litigation,\"   even        though   \"litigation    is    already   in\n\nprospect.\"      8 Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Richard L.\n\nMarcus, Federal Practice and Procedure, ยง 2024 (2008) (emphasis\n\nadded).     But, it is also true that \"'[d]ual purpose' documents\n\ncreated because of the prospect of litigation are protected even\n\nthough they were also prepared for a business purpose.\"                 Id.;   see\n\nalso In re Grand Jury Subpoena, 357 F.3d 900, 907 (9th Cir. 2004)\n\n(adopting Wright and Miller's \"because of\" test in order to handle\n\n\"dual purpose\" documents).\n\n             Thus, the best reading of the advisory committee's note\n\nis simply that preparation for business or for public requirements\n\nis preparation for a nonlitigation purpose insufficient in itself\n\nto warrant protection. The note states that there is no protection\n\nfor    documents   created       for    business,   regulatory,       or   \"other\n\nnonlitigation purposes.\"           This language suggests the note is\n\nconsidering    business    and    regulatory     purposes     as    nonlitigation\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fpurposes, but does not suggest that the presence of such a purpose\n\nshould somehow override a litigation purpose, should one exist. To\n\nthe contrary, the language of the note does not suggest that the\n\nadvisory committee was considering the problem of dual purpose\n\ndocuments.    Thus, we do not read the note as stating that there\n\nshould be no protection where a document is prepared because of the\n\npossibility of litigation but also for a business or regulatory\n\npurpose.6\n\n            Like   in   the   case   where   a   company   analyzes   pending\n\nlitigation for the purpose of setting aside a reserve, cf. Adlman,\n\n\n6\n   One district court in this circuit has reached an opposite\nconclusion. In re Raytheon Sec. Litig., 218 F.R.D. 354, 359 (D.\nMass. 2003) (\"However, even when documents were created 'because\nof' litigation, documents that are required to be prepared to\ncomply with the law may not be protected.\"). This approach refuses\nto protect documents prepared because of the possibility of\nlitigation simply because another possible purpose is present. As\nexplained infra, such an approach ignores the primary distinction\nbetween the \"because of\" and the \"primary purpose\" test.\n\n     The IRS also points to another decision in this circuit where\nthe district court analyzed opinion letters regarding investment\nvehicles alleged to be tax shelters. Fidelity Intern. Currency\nAdvisor A Fund, L.L.C., ex rel. Tax Matters Partner v. United\nStates, No. 05-40151, 2008 WL 4809032, at *13 (D. Mass. April 18,\n2008). The court found those letters' \"purpose was not to analyze\npending or imminent claims; instead, it was to induce the taxpayers\nto invest in the strategy (or, put differently, to provide comfort\nto those investors, particularly with respect to the possible\nimposition of future tax penalties).\" Id. But that court did not\nhold \"dual purpose\" documents unprotected. Rather, it essentially\nmade a factual call, which we do not now judge, that the\npossibility of litigation was too remote. Id. As explained, infra\nSection II.A.4, in the present case the context surrounding the\ncreation of the documents, namely the need to estimate reserve\nfunds, made it reasonable for Textron to foresee and analyze\nlitigation.\n\n                                     -20-\n\f134 F.3d at 1200 (describing hypothetical examples where work-\n\nproduct protection applies), here the business purpose derives from\n\nand is inextricably related to anticipating litigation.                 That the\n\nanticipation    of    such    disputes      (and    corresponding      potential\n\nlitigation)    also    triggered     certain       business    and    accounting\n\nobligations    does   not    bar   the   protection      of   the    work-product\n\ndoctrine.   See id. at 1202 (\"Where a document is created because of\n\nthe prospect of litigation, analyzing the likely outcome of that\n\nlitigation, it does not lose protection under this formulation\n\nmerely because it is created in order to assist with a business\n\ndecision.\"); In re Special September 1978 Grand Jury (II), 640 F.2d\n\n49, 61 (7th Cir. 1980) (\"We conclude that the materials . . .                  were\n\nindeed prepared in anticipation of litigation, even though they\n\nwere prepared as well for the filing of the Board of Elections\n\nreports.\").    In arguing against this conclusion, the IRS points to\n\na Third Circuit case where that court instructed the district court\n\non remand to assess whether a tax reserve file was prepared to\n\nassist in litigation or to comply with securities requirements.\n\nUnited States v. Rockwell Int'l, 897 F.2d 1255, 1266 (3d Cir.\n\n1990).    In the present case, however, the district court has\n\nalready   conducted    such    analysis     and    has   concluded      that    the\n\nworkpapers were created because of both purposes.\n\n            The dissent disagrees with this legal conclusion and\n\nrelies primarily on the language in Maine that \"the 'because of'\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fstandard does not protect from disclosure 'documents that are\n\nprepared in the ordinary course of business or that would have been\n\ncreated    in   essentially   similar   form   irrespective   of   the\n\nlitigation.'\"    Maine, 298 F.3d at 70 (quoting Adlman, 134 F.3d at\n\n1202).    Based on this language, the dissent charges we are going\n\nagainst established circuit precedent.         But, for the reasons\n\ndescribed above, it is error to read this \"ordinary course of\n\nbusiness\" language as implying that all documents prepared with\n\nsome business purpose in mind are necessarily unprotected.         The\n\ncourt in Maine was not confronted with dual purpose documents like\n\nthose at issue here.    Rather, that court recited the above quoted\n\nlanguage in the course of holding that there was insufficient\n\ninformation to see if the documents at issue were prepared for\n\nlitigation or rather in the ordinary course of business.           Id.\n\nThus, Maine's \"ordinary course of business\" language should not be\n\nread as barring protection for dual purpose documents where one\n\nbusiness purpose is present. This conclusion is all the more clear\n\nwhen one consider's Adlman's reason for adopting the \"because of\"\n\ntest:\n\n           The issue is less clear, however, as to\n           documents which, although prepared because of\n           expected litigation, are intended to inform a\n           business decision influenced by the prospects\n           of the litigation. The formulation applied by\n           some courts in determining whether documents\n           are protected by work-product privilege is\n           whether they are prepared \"primarily or\n           exclusively to assist in litigation\" -- a\n           formulation that would potentially exclude\n\n                                 -22-\n\f          documents containing analysis of expected\n          litigation, if their primary, ultimate, or\n          exclusive purpose is to assist in making the\n          business decision. Others ask whether the\n          documents were prepared \"because of\" existing\n          or expected litigation -- a formulation that\n          would include such documents, despite the fact\n          that their purpose is not to \"assist in\"\n          litigation. Because we believe that protection\n          of documents of this type is more consistent\n          with both the literal terms and the purposes\n          of the Rule, we adopt the latter formulation.\n\nAdlman, 134 F.3d at 1197-98, quoted in part in Maine, 298 F.3d at\n\n68.\n\n          Further, a contrary holding would lead to undesirable\n\nresults in other cases.    Consider a document prepared to analyze a\n\nspecific litigation in order to compute for an auditor how much\n\nmust be retained in a litigation reserve fund.          Were we to adopt\n\nthe IRS position that documents created to satisfy audit reporting\n\nresponsibilities   were   not   protected,   opposing   counsel   in   the\n\nlitigation might be able to discover such a memo, effectively\n\ndisclosing counsel's ultimate mental impression of the case.            In\n\nfact, in similar circumstances, the Sixth and Second circuits have\n\nsuggested that memoranda analyzing a transaction or position to be\n\nprotected by the work-product doctrine.        Roxworthy, 457 F.3d at\n\n600; Adlman, 134 F.3d at 1200-04 (remanding for the district court\n\nto apply the correct standard).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\f                             b.   Countervailing concerns\n\n            Having explained why application of the work-product\n\ndoctrine leads us to the conclusion that Textron's tax accrual\n\nworkpapers are protected, we pause to address the IRS's arguments\n\nagainst such a conclusion.\n\n                                   i.   Arthur Young\n\n            The IRS asserts our decision will run afoul of Supreme\n\nCourt precedent.       In Arthur Young, the Court declined to recognize\n\nan   accountant's   work-product        doctrine,       thus   holding   that   tax\n\naccrual workpapers created by an independent auditor were not\n\nprotected.     United States v. Arthur Young & Co., 465 U.S. 805, 815-\n\n21   (1984).     The    Court     recognized     that    the   auditor's    papers\n\nnecessarily included the taxpayer's own thinking about tax \"soft\n\nspots.\"   Id. at 813.        The Court also rejected some of the fairness\n\nconcerns implicated in that case.              Id. at 820 (rejecting argument\n\nthat \"enforcement of an IRS summons for accountants' tax accrual\n\nworkpapers permits the Government to probe the thought processes of\n\nits taxpayer citizens, thereby giving the IRS an unfair advantage\n\nin negotiating and litigating tax controversies\").                  Further, the\n\nCourt rejected policy concerns that, without a new privilege,\n\ncompanies would be tempted to withhold information from auditors.\n\nId. at 818-19 (finding that \"[r]esponsible corporate management\n\nwould not risk a qualified evaluation of a corporate taxpayer's\n\nfinancial    posture    to    afford    cover    for    questionable     positions\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\freflected    in   a   prior   tax    return\"     and    concluding   that   \"the\n\nindependent auditor's obligation to serve the public interest\n\nassures that the integrity of the securities markets will be\n\npreserved,   without    the   need    for    a   work-product    immunity   for\n\naccountants' tax accrual workpapers\").\n\n            Following this precedent, we have recognized that \"the\n\ndoctrine of construing the [attorney-client] privilege narrowly\n\n. . . has particular force in the context of IRS investigations\n\ngiven the 'congressional policy choice in favor of disclosure of\n\nall information relevant to a legitimate IRS inquiry.'\" Cavallaro,\n\n284 F.3d at 245-46 (quoting Arthur Young, 465 U.S. at 816). But\n\nunlike the Court in Arthur Young, we are not now confronted with\n\nthe question of whether to recognize a new privilege.                Here, the\n\ndoctrinal decision we face is whether to afford protection to\n\ndocuments created because of both business and litigation -- a\n\nquestion not presented in Arthur Young.7               Since this question has\n\n\n\n7\n   The IRS also suggests that the Supreme Court was comfortable\nwith discovery of taxpayer tax accrual workpapers because it\n\"affirmatively encouraged the IRS's seeking tax-accrual workpapers\nfrom the company prior to pursuing such workpapers from the\nauditor.\" IRS Reply Brief at 22-23 (citing Arthur Young, 465 U.S.\nat 820-21 & n.17). But the cited provisions of Arthur Young do not\nconsider the question of work-product protection, and do not\nendorse any particular method, but rather simply take note that the\nIRS \"has demonstrated administrative sensitivity\" by adopting a\npolicy to \"take all reasonable means to secure the information from\nthe corporation itself before issuing a summons to the independent\nauditor.\"    Arthur Young, 465 U.S. at 21 n.17.       Whether such\n\"reasonable means\" can include summons of a taxpayer's own tax\naccrual workpapers was not considered by the Supreme Court.\n\n                                      -25-\n\fbroader implications, the Supreme Court's policy judgment that a\n\nnew privilege is not necessary for the accurate preparation of\n\naccountants' tax accrual workpapers is not controlling.               Further,\n\nour prior analysis of this issue does not rely on the policy\n\nconsiderations rejected in Arthur Young.                 That case is not an\n\nobstacle   to       our   conclusion    that    protection   of   dual-purpose\n\ndocuments is consistent with the purpose and doctrine of the work-\n\nproduct doctrine.\n\n                                  ii.

In El Paso, the Fifth Circuit\n\nfound   that    a    company's   own    tax    accrual   workpapers   were   not\n\nprotected as they were created for purposes of complying with\n\nsecurities law:\n\n           In sum, we believe that the tax pool analysis\n           does not contemplate litigation in the sense\n           required to bring it within the work product\n           doctrine. The tax pool analysis concocts\n           theories about the results of possible\n           litigation; such analyses are not designed to\n           prepare   a   specific  case   for  trial   or\n           negotiation. Their sole function, from all\n           that appears in the record, is to back up a\n           figure on a financial balance sheet. Written\n           ultimately to comply with SEC regulations, the\n           tax pool analysis carries much more the aura\n           of daily business than it does of courtroom\n           combat. We hold, therefore, that the tax pool\n           analysis    and  backup  memoranda   are   not\n           protected work product materials.\n\n                                        -26-\n\fId. at 543-44.     However, in El Paso the Fifth Circuit applied a\n\ndifferent definition of the work-product doctrine, asking whether\n\nthe \"primary motivating purpose behind the creation of the document\n\nwas to aid in possible future litigation.\"         Id. at 542 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).      Thus, the result here does not create a\n\ncircuit split with El Paso, but is merely the application of an\n\nexisting   split   in    the   definition   of   the   \"anticipation     of\n\nlitigation.\"   It is precisely in these \"dual purpose\" situations\n\nthat the \"because of\" test used in this circuit distinguishes\n\nitself from the \"primary purpose\" test used in the Fifth Circuit.\n\nMaine, 298 F.3d at 68 (citing Adlman for the proposition that the\n\nprimary purpose test \"is at odds with the text and the policies of\n\nRule 26 because nothing in it suggests that documents prepared for\n\ndual purposes of litigation and business or agency decisions do not\n\nfall within its scope\").       Thus, unlike the Fifth Circuit, we need\n\nnot assess whether the tax accrual workpapers carry more of one\n\naura than another.      We need only conclude that since the analysis\n\nwas undertaken \"because of\" the anticipation of litigation, work-\n\nproduct protection applies.\n\n                                iii.   Factual argument\n\n           Since some tax positions in the accrual papers carry a\n\n100 percent chance of failing, the IRS argues, as a factual matter,\n\nthat Textron could not have been anticipating litigation.              But,\n\nTextron explained that those entries were the result of identifying\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fpositions that were incorrect as a result of subsequent legal\n\ndevelopments.    The IRS also argues that most disputes are resolved\n\ninformally.     But the fact that most disputes are resolved before\n\nlitigation commences does not mean that analysis of those disputes\n\ncould not have been in anticipation of \"the prospect of litigation\"\n\nover those disputes.      To the contrary, assessing the likelihood\n\nthat a tax position will not withstand scrutiny necessarily entails\n\nanalysis which anticipates how litigation of that position would be\n\nresolved.\n\n                   4.    Has   Textron  adequately   identified the\n                         specific litigation for which the workpapers\n                         were prepared?\n\n            Adlman and Roxworthy, cases we relied on above, are also\n\nnot directly on point as they involved documents analyzing the\n\nconsequences of a specific litigation or specific transaction. The\n\nIRS argues that this distinction is controlling, that to protect\n\nTextron's tax accrual workpapers is in effect to afford a \"blanket\"\n\nprotection -- a work-product doctrine that is so broad it will\n\n\"swallow\" the attorney-client privilege.         It is true that we have\n\nrequired    proponents   of   a   work-product    protection   claim   to\n\n\"'identify the litigation for which the document was created . . .\n\nand explain why the work-product privilege applies to all portions\n\nof the document.'\"       Maine, 298 F.3d at 69 (quoting Church of\n\nScientology Int'l v. United States Dep't of Justice, 30 F.3d 224,\n\n237 (1st Cir. 1994)).         These \"identification and explanation\n\n\n                                  -28-\n\frequirements are not to be given a hypertechnical construction,\"\n\nbut \"they can neither be brushed aside nor satisfied by vague\n\ngeneralities.\"     Id.\n\n           Here, Textron has met its burden.                      The tax accrual\n\nworkpapers identify and numerically evaluate a number of tax\n\npositions Textron took on its 2001 returns.                  As described above,\n\nTextron has shown that its analysis of each position was prepared\n\nby anticipating the possibility of litigation with the IRS arising\n\nover a dispute regarding that position.                    Thus, the tax accrual\n\nworkpapers     identify    specific       positions,        and    the     litigation\n\nprojections were created in anticipation of disputes and possible\n\nlitigation over those positions.8\n\n           The    IRS    again     argues      that   Textron      could    not    have\n\nconsistently     had    specific      litigation      in   mind    since    most   tax\n\ndisputes were resolved before litigation and since Textron could\n\nnot reasonably intend to litigate every challenged position.                       But\n\nthese facts do not change our analysis.                    As the district court\n\nfound,   the   spreadsheet       at    issue    assessed     the    likelihood       of\n\nsucceeding in litigation over each specific position.                      Thus, the\n\n\n\n8\n   The IRS posits that some entries in the tax accrual workpapers\nmay refer to reserves held for deferred taxes over which no\nlitigation is to be expected. That some reserves may not be based\non disputes does not change our conclusion regarding computation of\nreserves that are based on potential disputes. Further, the IRS\nhas not requested that we order the production of only the papers\nregarding deferred tax reserves, which in any event, would not\nappear to be relevant to assisting the IRS.\n\n                                        -29-\n\ffunction served by creating this analysis is to assess what funds\n\nmust be set aside in anticipation of litigation over each of the\n\npositions identified.    That Textron might ultimately decide not to\n\ndispute a specific position does not contradict the conclusion that\n\nwhen it estimated its litigation success, it was anticipating\n\nspecific litigation.\n\n            Again, we note that a contrary result would lead to an\n\nundesirable result.       If we were only to afford work product\n\nprotection over documents of this sort by requiring a showing, as\n\nthe   IRS   suggests,   that   there   was   some   specific   quantum   of\n\nexpectation that the position at issue would mature into full-\n\nfledged litigation, we would essentially be offering protection\n\nonly to the cantankerous and combative taxpayer who intends to\n\nthoroughly litigate every position.\n\n            Precedent does suggest that a party claiming work-product\n\nprotection must \"'have had a subjective belief that litigation was\n\na real possibility, and that belief must have been objectively\n\nreasonable.'\"    Roxworthy, 457 F.3d at 594 (quoting In re Sealed\n\nCase, 146 F.3d 881, 888 (D.C. Cir. 1998)).            The district court\n\nfound that, considering its history, it was reasonable for Textron\n\nto conclude that litigation with the IRS was likely.           We see the\n\nmatter differently but reach the same result.\n\n            In the context of these facts, we do not think that a\n\nhistory of litigation with the IRS should be the deciding factor.\n\n\n                                  -30-\n\fA company with a history of challenging the IRS creates these\n\ndocuments \"because of\" the same reason as another company without\n\nsuch a history: the possibility of a dispute compels them to\n\nanticipate litigation so as to prepare and assess their tax reserve\n\nfunds.   In this case, the anticipation of litigation coupled with\n\nsecurities and reporting requirements forced Textron to analyze and\n\nproject its likelihood of success in litigation. Thus, Textron was\n\neffectively forced to operate under the hypothetical belief that\n\nlitigation    would    occur.      For   this    reason,    regardless   of   its\n\nspecific history with the IRS, it was objectively reasonable for\n\nTextron to forecast litigation.\n\n             The IRS argues that this holding will \"immunize nearly\n\nevery document generated by lawyers because clients can always be\n\nsaid to be aware of possible litigation.\"               The IRS worries that\n\nwork-product protection would \"encompass essentially all legal\n\nadvice,\" since any lawyer analyzing the risks inherent in a legal\n\ntransaction    or     position    will   be     able   to   gain   work-product\n\nprotection by saying that the analysis was prepared in anticipation\n\nof litigation regarding that transaction or position. We disagree.\n\nAs we have just explained, in the case of tax accrual workpapers,\n\nthe   dual    purposes    --     financial      reporting    and   anticipating\n\nlitigation    --    are   necessarily     intertwined;       the   function   of\n\npreparing adequate financial reports inherently requires Textron to\n\nanticipate and analyze litigation.            The anticipation of litigation\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\fmay be similarly intertwined in other cases.             See, e.g., Delaney,\n\nMigdail & Young, Chartered v. IRS, 826 F.2d 124, 127 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1987) (distinguishing case law requiring a \"specific claim\" to\n\nuphold a claim of work-product protection to certain IRS memoranda\n\nanalyzing potential legal vulnerabilities).              But in many cases,\n\nthere will not be an obvious objectively reasonable need to foresee\n\nlitigation.9    Of course, each case will depend on its facts.           See,\n\ne.g., Adlman, 134 F.3d at 1204 (remanding for further fact finding\n\napplying the correct standard).               But, in the present case, we\n\nconclude   that   Textron's     need    to    consider   the   possibility   of\n\nlitigation     with   respect   to   each     disputed   position   adequately\n\nsatisfies this requirement.\n\n\n9\n    For example, the IRS argues that protecting Textron's tax\naccrual papers would lead to protection of documents prepared by a\nbank to estimate loan failure rates. We disagree. A loan may fail\nfor all sorts of reasons. Tax positions would ultimately succeed\nor fall based on their legal merit, assessed through litigation.\nIn this case, the combination of the possibility of litigation and\nreporting requirements required Textron to anticipate litigation.\nLegal analysis of other transactions and positions may not entail\nsuch specific consideration of litigation.\n\n     The IRS also fears our holding will somehow lead companies to\nuse lawyers to conduct performance reviews, then seek work-product\nprotection for such documents. We think such a hypothetical is\ndistinguishable. In such a case, the employer may be evaluating\nthe employee's performance for business purposes, regardless of the\npossibility of litigation.      Here, Textron evaluates its tax\npositions for business purposes precisely because of the\npossibility those positions will be challenged in litigation.\nThus, the business context makes it reasonable for Textron to\nanticipate and foresee litigation.     While such a question is a\nfactual matter for another case, it seems less likely that the\nfunction of employee evaluations would similarly make it reasonable\nfor an employer to anticipate litigation.\n\n                                       -32-\n\f          B.     Waiver of Work-Product Protection\n\n          Unlike        attorney-client         privilege,        \"work    product\n\nprotection is provided against 'adversaries,' so only disclosing\n\nmaterial in a way inconsistent with keeping it from an adversary\n\nwaives   work    product     protection.\"          MIT,     129    F.3d   at   687.\n\nSpecifically, \"disclosure to an adversary, real or potential,\n\nforfeits work product protection.\" Id.\n\n          We     must   decide     whether    Textron     waived     work-product\n\nprotection by showing its tax accrual workpapers to E&Y, its\n\nindependent     auditor.     A   number    of    district    court    cases    have\n\nconcluded that disclosure to independent auditors does not waive\n\nwork-product     protection.        See,     e.g.,   Regions       Fin.   Corp.   &\n\nSubsidiaries v. United States, No. 06-00895, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS\n\n41940, at *27-28 (N.D. Ala. May 8, 2008); Lawrence E. Jaffe Pension\n\nPlan v. Household Int'l, Inc., 237 F.R.D. 176, 183 (N.D. Ill. 2006)\n\n(\"Disclosing     documents    to    an   auditor     does    not    substantially\n\nincrease the opportunity for potential adversaries to obtain the\n\ninformation.\"); Merrill Lynch & Co. v. Allegheny Energy, Inc., 229\n\nF.R.D. 441, 448 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (\"A business and its auditor can\n\nand should be aligned insofar as they both seek to prevent, detect,\n\nand root out corporate fraud.\").             But see Medinol v. Boston Sci.\n\nCorp., 214 F.R.D. 113, 116-17 (S.D.N.Y. 2002) (\"Boston Scientific\n\nand its outside auditor Ernst & Young did not share 'common\n\ninterests' in litigation, and disclosures to Ernst & Young as\n\n\n                                      -33-\n\findependent auditors did not therefore serve the privacy interests\n\nthat the work product doctrine was intended to protect.\").        It is\n\nundisputed that Textron and E&Y were not actual adversaries.        The\n\nIRS argues by analogy to MIT that they were potential adversaries.\n\nIn MIT, we found work-product privilege waived when MIT disclosed\n\ndocuments to a Defense Department auditing agency.         128 F.3d at\n\n687. The audit agency was reviewing MIT's expense submissions. Id.\n\nWe found MIT and the agency to be potential adversaries as, \"MIT\n\ndoubtless hoped that there would be no actual controversy between\n\nit and the Department of Defense, but the potential for dispute and\n\neven litigation was certainly there.\"       Id.\n\n          The    facts   here   are   different.   While   the   Defense\n\nDepartment auditing agency was reviewing expenses to determine if\n\nit would challenge those expenses, E&Y was not auditing Textron in\n\norder to identify disputes it would have with Textron, but rather,\n\nto decide if it could issue a letter certifying Textron's financial\n\nstatements.     This is a cooperative not adversarial relationship.\n\nSee Jaffe Pension Plan, 237 F.R.D. at 183 (\"[T]he fact that an\n\nindependent auditor must remain independent from the company it\n\naudits does not establish that the auditor also has an adversarial\n\nrelationship with the client as contemplated by the work product\n\ndoctrine.\").    While it is possible to imagine circumstances where\n\nE&Y's professional obligations could cause E&Y and Textron to come\n\ninto conflict on some legal question, the IRS can point to no\n\n\n                                  -34-\n\f\"conceivable scenario in which E & Y would file a lawsuit against\n\n[Textron] because of something E & Y learned from [Textron's]\n\ndisclosures.\"    Regions, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 41940, at * 27-28\n\n(citing MIT and the district court's opinion in this case to\n\nconclude that there was no waiver in similar circumstances).\n\nWhereas MIT's disclosure to the Defense Department auditing agency\n\nhad the potential to directly trigger a dispute with that agency,\n\nno such potential adversity existed here.\n\n           Disclosure to a conduit to a potential adversary can also\n\nwaive   work-product    protection.         Raytheon,   218    F.R.D.    at   360\n\n(collecting cases).     In other words, waiver occurs upon disclosure\n\nto a third party that \"substantially increased the opportunities\n\nfor potential adversaries to obtain the information.\" 8 Wright,\n\nMiller,   &   Marcus,   supra,   ยง    2024    (2008).         Though    E&Y   has\n\nprofessional confidentiality obligations limiting disclosure, the\n\nIRS argues that it may be required to turn documents over to the\n\nSEC and may, in some circumstances, have a duty to disclose\n\ninformation to protect stockholders. See Arthur Young, 465 U.S. at\n\n817-18 (\"The independent public accountant performing this special\n\nfunction owes ultimate allegiance to the corporation's creditors\n\nand stockholders, as well as to the investing public.\").\n\n           The IRS also argues that E&Y may be required to disclose\n\nthis information in response to a valid subpoena. At first glance,\n\nthis argument seems circular: a subpoena would only be valid if the\n\n\n                                     -35-\n\fprotection did not survive.     But, on further examination, the\n\nquestion is more complicated.   The record establishes that E&Y did\n\nnot retain a copy of Textron's tax accrual workpapers.     Thus, at\n\nfirst we would see little likelihood that E&Y would have to\n\ndisclose those papers.   But, E&Y used those papers, together with\n\nits own expertise, in preparing its own assessment of Textron's\n\nreserve tax liability.    Therefore, the only remaining documents\n\nwhich could be subjected to a risk of discovery are E&Y's own\n\nassessments, which incorporate Textron's analysis.\n\n          Though we hold Textron's tax accrual workpapers are\n\nprotected, Arthur Young suggests that E&Y's workpapers may be\n\ndiscoverable.   465 U.S. at 815-821.10   In fact, as we find infra,\n\nTextron itself may be required to produce E&Y's workpapers on\n\nremand.\n\n          Since E&Y's workpapers may be discoverable, the question\n\nwe must ask is whether disclosure of those workpapers substantially\n\nincreased the risk that the contents of Textron's workpapers would\n\nbe disclosed to an adversary. As the Supreme Court has recognized,\n\nindependent auditors \"obtain and assess the opinions, speculations,\n\nand projections of management with regard to unclear, aggressive,\n\nor questionable tax positions that may have been taken on prior tax\n\n\n10\n     Though the parties debate the extent of confidentiality\nagreements and expectations of privacy between Textron and E&Y, we\nfind such expectations irrelevant here, since a bilateral\nconfidentiality agreement regarding Textron's workpapers would not\ndefeat a valid IRS subpoena for E&Y's workpapers.\n\n                                -36-\n\freturns.\"     Arthur Young, 465 U.S. at 812.       Further the auditor's\n\nworkpapers \"may document the auditor's interviews with corporate\n\npersonnel.\" Id. (emphasis added).          Thus, disclosure of E&Y's\n\nworkpapers might reveal Textron's own analysis. On the other hand,\n\nE&Y's affiant, Weston, suggested that E&Y \"did not rely solely upon\n\nthe conclusions of [Textron's] tax counsel\" but instead \"applied\n\nits own professional knowledge and judgment.\" Because the district\n\ncourt did not address the question of whether the IRS can gain\n\ndiscovery of E&Y's tax workpapers through a subpoena to Textron, it\n\nmade no factual findings regarding the actual contents of E&Y's\n\nworkpapers or the extent to which disclosure of such workpapers\n\nwould   effectively     constitute    disclosure     of   Textron's   own\n\nassessment.      Rather than rely on vague language suggesting what\n\nmight be in E&Y's workpapers, we think that this is a question the\n\ndistrict court must develop on remand through in camera inspection,\n\nif feasible, or through testimony.\n\n            C.   E&Y's Workpapers\n\n            The IRS's subpoena also sought tax accrual workpapers\n\nprepared by E&Y that were within the possession, custody, or\n\ncontrol of Textron or its accountants.      The district court did not\n\ninclude such workpapers in its definition of the documents sought\n\nand so did not rule on their discoverability.       The IRS asserts that\n\nsuch failure to rule is error.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -37-\n\f             Textron argues that this omission is the fault of the\n\nIRS.   When convening the evidentiary hearing, the district court\n\ncalled on the parties to present evidence on the question of\n\n\"[w]hat specific types of documents are included in the 'Tax\n\nAccrual Workpapers' and 'backup' documentation\" sought by the\n\nsummons.      But the evidence at the evidentiary hearing simply\n\nconcerned Textron's workpapers, and the IRS did not bring up E&Y's\n\nworkpapers.        Textron thus argues that the IRS should not be\n\npermitted to now challenge the scope of the district court's\n\nconstruction of the summons.        We disagree.\n\n             The summons explicitly sought these documents and the\n\nrecord indicates that the government reiterated its request in its\n\nbriefing     and   at   the   initial    oral    arguments    held   before   the\n\nevidentiary hearing was scheduled.              The district court was fairly\n\nput on notice of this request, and in fact, when discussing the\n\napplicability of I.R.C. ยง 7525, stated at the oral arguments, \"I\n\nthink you've made your case as far as the Ernst & Young papers.\"\n\nThat   the   evidentiary      hearing    focused     on    developing   evidence\n\nregarding the nature of Textron's tax accrual workpapers does not\n\nshow that the IRS had abandoned its clearly made request for E&Y's\n\nworkpapers.        In   other   words,     since     the   IRS   \"squarely    and\n\ndistinctly\" requested E&Y's workpapers, and the district court was\n\non notice of the issue, the argument is not waived.

Textron also does not meaningfully dispute the\n\ngovernment's prima facie showing of relevance.               Instead, Textron\n\ncontends that we may nevertheless affirm the district court because\n\nTextron,   the   only    defendant    in    this   action,    does   not    have\n\npossession, custody, or control of these documents.\n\n           In the normal discovery context, \"so long as the party\n\nhas the legal right or ability to obtain the documents from another\n\nsource upon demand, that party is deemed to have control.\"                 Mercy\n\nCatholic Med.

Thompson, 380 F.3d 142, 160 (3d Cir. 2004);\n\nsee also 8A Wright, Miller, & Marcus, supra, ยง 2210 (\"Inspection\n\ncan be had if the party to whom the request is made has the legal\n\nright to obtain the document, even though in fact it has no\n\ncopy.\").   Textron has provided us with no argument why that test\n\nshould not apply in the IRS subpoena context.\n\n           Textron argues that its witness testified that Textron\n\ncould not access the documents.        But Textron mischaracterizes the\n\nrecord. Textron's witness simply testified that E&Y did not give\n\nTextron its workpapers, not that Textron could not obtain copies of\n\n\n                                     -39-\n\fthe documents upon request.     Thus Textron has no evidence showing\n\nthat it did not have the ability to demand the documents.          Textron\n\nargues that R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 5-3.1-22 establishes an independent\n\nauditor owns its own workpapers. But, again, it does not establish\n\nthat Textron does not have the ability or contractual right to\n\nrequest the documents.\n\n          The IRS has some evidence to suggest that Textron may\n\nhave had the right to demand E&Y's workpapers.      Raymond, a Textron\n\nwitness, stated that she had reviewed E&Y's files to confirm that\n\nE&Y did not retain Textron's workpapers.     The IRS argues that this\n\nshows Textron has the right to obtain the documents.               Textron\n\nargues it shows only a right to temporary access.          We need not\n\nparse this testimony, since even adopting Textron's interpretation,\n\nwe could not affirm on this basis.         Textron has the burden of\n\nshowing a lack of control and has produced no evidence to meet this\n\nburden.   United States v. Lawn Builders of New England, 856 F.2d\n\n388, 392 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"'Once the district court has reason to\n\nbelieve that the requested documents exist, the burden then shifts\n\nto the summonee to show that he is not in possession of them.'\"\n\n(quoting United States v. Freedom Church, 613 F.2d 316, 322 (1st\n\nCir. 1979))).   Thus, we remand for the district court to determine\n\nthe   factual   question   of   whether   Textron   can   obtain     E&Y's\n\nworkpapers.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -40-\n\f                           III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ndetermination that Textron's tax accrual workpapers are protected,\n\naffirm that Textron and E&Y were not potential adversaries, but\n\nvacate the ultimate determination that work-product protection was\n\nnot waived, and remand for the district court to reassess, in a\n\nmanner consistent with this opinion, the question of whether\n\ndisclosure   of   E&Y's   workpapers   would   reveal   the   information\n\ncontained in Textron's own workpapers.         On remand the district\n\ncourt should also assess the discoverability of E&Y's workpapers by\n\ndetermining whether Textron has the legal right or ability to\n\nobtain these documents.\n\n          Affirmed in part, Vacated in part, and Remanded.\n          No Costs are imposed.\n\n\n\n\n             -Concurring and Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                  -41-\n\f            BOUDIN, Circuit Judge, concurring in part and dissenting\n\nin part.    The central issue is whether Textron's tax-accrual work\n\npapers are protected from IRS summons because they are attorney\n\nwork product.     Any lawyer might be unnerved to find that his\n\npotential adversary could obtain the lawyer's own estimate of his\n\nchances of success.       But under our own precedent and consistent\n\nwith other circuits, tax-accrual work papers are not protected\n\nbecause they are prepared for reasons independent of the need to\n\nprepare for or conduct litigation.\n\n            Federal     securities        laws    require    publicly   traded\n\ncorporations    like    Textron     to    have   their   financial   statements\n\ncertified by an independent auditor.             See 15 U.S.C. ยงยง 78l, 78m; 17\n\nC.F.R. ยง 210 et seq.      Key to the audit is evaluating \"the adequacy\n\nand    reasonableness    of   the    corporation's       reserve   account   for\n\ncontingent tax liabilities.\"         United States v.

Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S.\n\n495, 510-12 & n.9 (1947).        The attorney-client privilege is not in\n\nany way confined to advice given for use in litigation, Mead Data\n\nCentral, Inc. v.

Cir. 1977), but the latter privilege was held to be waived by\n\nTextron and is not at issue on this appeal.\n\n            In our circuit and in others, documents are said to be\n\ncreated \"in anticipation of litigation,\" and thus eligible for work\n\nproduct protection if, \"in light of the nature of the document and\n\nthe factual situation in the particular case, the document can be\n\n\n\n11\n   SILO transactions are \"a combination of a sale of an asset by\na tax-exempt entity\" followed by a \"lease back to the same entity.\"\nShvedov, Tax Implications of SILOs, QTEs, and Other Leasing\nTransactions with Tax-Exempt Entities 1, CRS Report for Congress\n(Nov. 30, 2004).

Adlman, 134\n\nF.3d 1194, 1202 (2d Cir. 1998)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe \"because of\" phrase, standing alone, does not answer the\n\nquestion what happens if the document is created to satisfy some\n\nrequirement imposed independently of the need to litigate, but our\n\nprecedent squarely answers the question.\n\n            We have held that work-product protection does not extend\n\nto \"documents that are prepared in the ordinary course of business\n\nor   that   would   have   been   created    in   essentially   similar   form\n\nirrespective of the litigation.\"            Maine, 298 F.3d at 70 (quoting\n\nAdlman, 134 F.3d at 1202) (internal quotation marks omitted). This\n\ncaveat applies \"even though litigation is already in prospect,\"\n\nAdlman, 134 F.3d at 1202 (citing 8 Wright, Miller & Cooper, Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure ยง 2024, at 346 (3d ed. 1998)), and even if\n\n\"the documents aid in the preparation of litigation.\"             Maine, 298\n\nF.3d at 70.\n\n            The district court held that the work papers \"would not\n\nhave been prepared 'but for' the fact that Textron anticipated the\n\npossibility of litigation with the IRS\" and that if \"Textron had\n\nnot anticipated a dispute with the IRS, there would have been no\n\nreason for it to establish any reserve or to prepare the work\n\npapers used to calculate the reserve.\"            U.S. v. Textron Inc., 507\n\n\n                                     -44-\n\fF. Supp. 2d 138, 150 (D.R.I. 2007).           But this misreads Maine: Maine\n\nholds that it is not the subject matter discussed in the materials\n\nthat controls but whether documents are prepared \"in the ordinary\n\ncourse of business\" or were otherwise independently required, which\n\nare   both   the   case   with   tax   accrual    work   papers   mandated   by\n\naccounting requirements.\n\n             The decisions in other circuits bear out this legal\n\ninterpretation. In Adlman itself, the company in question had \"the\n\nprospect of litigation [with the IRS] in mind\" when it asked for\n\nthe preparation of a memorandum studying the tax implications of a\n\ncontemplated restructuring; nonetheless, the Second Circuit allowed\n\nthat if the memorandum would have been prepared in a similar form\n\nwithout expected litigation with the IRS, then it was not created\n\n\"because of\" litigation.

Roxworthy, 457 F.3d 590, 598-99 (6th Cir. 2006).12\n\n             Conversely, in cases finding documents to be protected,\n\nit is because the documents were created in order to be useful in\n\nlitigation.

This\n\nis not what the district court found and, given the legal rule\n\nadopted in Maine and Adlman, it would not matter if it had so\n\nfound.\n\n           The government offered compelling evidence that the sole\n\nreason for the creation of Textron's estimates of risk with respect\n\nto individual tax positions was to prepare the reserve figures for\n\nthe company books and statements and to satisfy the auditors that\n\nthe reserves were adequate.      No contrary evidence was offered by\n\nTextron.   The district court made no contrary finding and any such\n\nfinding would have been clearly erroneous. The government's expert\n\nwitness--the former chief auditor of the Public Company Accounting\n\nOversight Board--testified:\n\n\n                                     -46-\n\f          Q: Does a public company prepare tax accrual\n          work    papers  only   when   it   anticipates\n          litigation over the issues identified in the\n          work papers?\n          A: No. They have to prepare them to support\n          the    representations   in    the   financial\n          statements.\n          Q: So if a public company believes the chances\n          of litigation over the issues in the work\n          papers are remote, it would still prepare\n          those work papers?\n          A: Yes. because they'd have to be able to\n          support that judgment [to the independent\n          auditor].\n          Q: And would those work papers be prepared in\n          the same form as work papers involving issues\n          for which the company actually anticipates\n          litigation?\n          A: Certainly, the basics would be the same....\n                  ...\n          Q: Would the tax accrual work papers ever be\n          blank?\n          A: I can't think of a circumstance where they\n          would, no.\n\n          Textron's own witness acknowledged that it would \"have to\n\ninclude in its . . . tax accrual work papers any new transactions\n\nthat the company entered into that year that there might be some\n\ntax exposure on\" regardless of whether it anticipated litigation\n\nwith the IRS. Textron offered no testimony purporting to show that\n\nits lawyers had any intention of utilizing its assessment in the\n\nconduct of any litigation that might ensue (although it did offer\n\nspeculation as to how such documents might conceivably be helpful),\n\nand such a use is not even arguably the driving purpose behind the\n\ndocument's creation.\n\n          The only circuit precedent that directly involves tax\n\naccrual work papers held that they were not protected attorney work\n\n                               -47-\n\fproduct.

Without endorsing everything in the articles, it is fair\n\nto say that they make scholarly mince-meat of Textron's position.\n\n            In    most    matters      of   privilege,       there    is    a   certain\n\narbitrariness     as     to    where   to   draw    the      line    or,   to   put    it\n\ndifferently, even the most sacrosanct of privileges represents a\n\nsacrifice   of    other       interests--usually,       as    Bentham      classically\n\n\n\n13\n   El Paso denied protection for the work papers because the court\nrecognized that the company in question was conducting the relevant\nanalysis because of a need to \"bring its financial books into\nconformity with generally accepted auditing principles.\" Id. at\n543. And, it saw the need to satisfy independent auditors as being\n\"compelled by the securities laws.\" Id.\n\n                                         -48-\n\fexplained, the interest of truth.         8 Wigmore, Evidence ยง 2291\n\n(McNaughton Rev. 1961).      Here, the matter is not open to a panel\n\nfor re-examination on policy grounds, but no one should think that\n\nthe policy arguments are all on one side.\n\n            Precisely because the work papers in this instance are\n\nrequired by the financial statement obligations and accounting\n\nrules, there is little risk of the chilling effect so often paraded\n\nin privilege cases. The Supreme Court in rejecting an accountant's\n\nprivilege for the preparation of tax accrual work papers pointed\n\nout that large companies effectively have to comply with the\n\naccounting requirements and would do so with or without a privilege\n\nfor the accountant.     Arthur Young, 465 U.S. at 818-19.\n\n            And, while it may seem one-sided to give the government\n\nTextron's blue print to weaknesses in Textron's tax returns, the\n\nreturn     is   massive--constituting    more   than   4000   pages;    the\n\ngovernment has an important interest in collecting taxes that are\n\nowed; and its inquiries into work papers were focused on a specific\n\ntype of transaction that had been shown to be open to abuse.             So\n\ncontext should be kept in mind before shedding too many tears for\n\nTextron.\n\n            In all events, it is important for us to adhere to the\n\nexisting rules of the road.      Parties can generally adjust their\n\nbehavior so long as they know what privilege rules apply.              Here,\n\nthe governing rubric in Maine (First Circuit) and Adlman (Second\n\n\n                                  -49-\n\fCircuit) and a precise precedent in El Paso (Fifth Circuit) govern\n\nthis case.

The question presented by this\n\nappeal is whether the work-product doctrine protects documents\n\nprepared by Textron Inc. for the purpose of calculating tax reserve\n\nliability from production to the IRS pursuant to an investigative\n\nsubpoena.     Like other companies, Textron prepares \"tax accrual\n\nworkpapers\"    which,     generally   speaking,      list    the   questionable\n\npositions Textron took on its tax returns, estimate the likelihood\n\nthat those positions will not withstand scrutiny, and calculate the\n\namount of additional tax liability that would result from revision\n\nof those positions.       Textron prepares these estimates so that it\n\ncan maintain an adequate reserve fund, properly report its assets\n\nand   liabilities,   and    obtain    independent     certification     of   its\n\nfinancial statements.        As part of the auditing process, Textron\n\nshowed these tax accrual workpapers to Ernst & Young (\"E&Y\") an\n\nindependent auditor.\n\n            This   case    arose   when     the   Internal   Revenue   Service\n\n(\"IRS\"), after noticing potential tax shelter transactions, issued\n\nan administrative summons to Textron pursuant to I.R.C. ยง 7602\n\nseeking tax accrual workpapers for Textron's 2001 tax returns.\n\nTextron refused to comply and asserted a number of defenses.

After an evidentiary hearing,\n\nthe district court ruled for Textron on its work-product protection\n\nclaim, but rejected its other defenses.             The district court also\n\nfound that Textron's disclosure to E&Y did not constitute waiver.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fThe IRS appeals.    After careful review,1 we affirm in part, vacate\n\nin part, and remand.\n\n                             I.    Background\n\n          The IRS subpoena sought \"Tax Accrual Workpapers,\" defined\n\nas:\n\n          [A]11 accrual and other financial workpapers\n          or documents created or assembled by the\n          Taxpayer, an accountant for the Taxpayer, or\n          the Taxpayer's independent auditor relating to\n          any tax reserve for current, deferred, and\n          potential or contingent tax liabilities,\n          however classified or reported on audited\n          financial statements, and to any footnotes\n          disclosing reserves or contingent liabilities\n          on audited financial statements. They include,\n          but are not limited to, any and all analyses,\n          computations, opinions, notes, summaries,\n          discussions, and other documents relating to\n          such reserves and any footnotes.\n\nThe subpoena sought all documents in the actual or constructive\n\npossession, custody, or control of Textron or its accountants. The\n\ndistrict court held oral arguments where the government reiterated\n\nthat it was seeking tax accrual documents prepared by Textron or\n\nE&Y.   Textron     argued   that   it   had   created   the   documents   in\n\nanticipation of a dispute with the IRS regarding its tax returns.\n\n\n\n1\n   Textron was joined by amici curiae Committee on Taxation and\nCommittee   on  Corporate   Reporting   of   Financial   Executives\nInternational, Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America,\nand Association of Corporate Counsel. The IRS has submitted two\nscholarly articles which we have considered: Dennis J. Ventry, Jr.,\nProtecting Abusive Tax Avoidance, 120 Tax Notes 857 (2008); and\nClaudine Pease-Wingenter, The Application of the Attorney-Client\nPrivilege to Tax Accrual Workpapers: The Real Legacy of United\nStates v. Textron, 8 Houston Bus. & Tax L.J. 337 (2008).\n\n                                    -4-\n\f            The district court then held an evidentiary hearing on\n\nthe types of documents included in the definition of \"tax accrual\n\nworkpapers\" and the basis for Textron's work product claim. At the\n\nevidentiary hearing, the IRS's expert witness, Professor Douglas\n\nCarmichael, testified that securities law requires that public\n\ncompanies obtain a letter from an independent auditor approving the\n\ncompany's financial statements, and that part of that audit was an\n\nanalysis    of   the    company's       reserves      for    covering       tax   loss.\n\nTextron's   former     Director       of   Tax     Reporting,     Roxanne    Cassidy,\n\ncountered   that     the      tax    accrual      workpapers      were   created    \"to\n\ndetermine whether Textron was adequately reserved with respect to\n\nany potential disputes or litigations that would happen in the\n\nfuture.\" Cassidy and Norman Richter, Textron tax counsel, explained\n\nthat the tax accrual workpapers listed positions Textron was taking\n\non its tax returns that might require that a reserve be set aside.\n\nThese   positions      were    then    analyzed      by    Textron   attorneys      who\n\nestimated a percentage likelihood that the position would not\n\nprevail if challenged by the IRS.                Textron calls this the \"hazards\n\nof litigation percentage.\"            The reserve requirement was calculated\n\nby multiplying this percentage times the tax benefit claimed.\n\n            In   response,          Carmichael,      the    IRS    expert     witness,\n\ncontended that public companies prepare these papers every year to\n\ncomply with securities law regardless of whether they expect\n\nlitigation. But, Richter testified that the tax accrual workpapers\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fwere prepared under the assumption that issues identified would be\n\nchallenged by the IRS and would need to be defended.                   He further\n\ntestified that if Textron did not anticipate any disputes, the tax\n\naccrual workpapers would be blank. The IRS disagreed, arguing that\n\nsome workpapers would nevertheless be necessary to handle deferred\n\ntaxes or to justify setting aside no tax reserve.\n\n              It was undisputed that the IRS audits every Textron\n\nreturn in multi-year cycles.          Testimony also showed that in each\n\naudit cycle hundreds of IRS adjustments to Textron's returns were\n\nsimply accepted by Textron.       Where Textron and the IRS do dispute\n\ntax liability, their dispute could be resolved through a conference\n\nwith the audit team, by presentation of arguments to the IRS Office\n\nof Appeals, or, ultimately, federal court litigation.                 In seven of\n\nthe last eight audit cycles, Textron and the IRS have brought at\n\nleast one issue to the IRS Office of Appeals.                 Between 1959 and\n\npresent, Textron and the IRS have litigated three disputes in\n\nfederal court.        Textron admitted that it expected to concede\n\nseveral   issues     identified   in    the     workpapers,     and     that   the\n\npercentage     for   those   issues    was    listed   as    \"100%.\"      Textron\n\nexplained that those items were due to instances where legal\n\ndevelopments rendered a prior position undefendable.\n\n              IRS agents explained that access to the workpapers would\n\nhelp   them    navigate   Textron's    4000    page    tax   return    which   was\n\naccompanied by \"9 four-drawer file cabinets\" of paper.                   The IRS\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fwitnesses explained that the tax accrual workpapers would help the\n\nIRS understand the substance of a transaction and could help the\n\nIRS identify potential issues with Textron's return.                 An agent\n\ntestified that in 2006 the IRS adopted the policy of seeking tax\n\naccrual workpapers when the audit team becomes aware (sometime\n\nthrough self-reporting) of certain transactions by the taxpayer\n\nwhich potentially constitute abusive tax shelters.\n\n           As to the waiver issue, the IRS's expert, Carmichael,\n\ntestified that companies create these tax accrual workpapers,\n\nknowing that they will be shared with an auditor.               Evidence also\n\nshowed that the auditor's code of ethics requires information be\n\nkept confidential unless required to be produced in response to a\n\nsubpoena or other legal obligation. Mark Weston, a partner at E&Y,\n\nsubmitted an affidavit explaining these confidentiality obligations\n\nand   further   stating   that   E&Y    had   not   in   fact   disclosed   any\n\ninformation regarding Textron's 2001 tax accrual computations. But\n\nthe IRS expert opined that auditors ultimately owe an allegiance to\n\nthe investing public and have legal obligations of disclosure in\n\nsome instances.\n\n           Textron countered that it let E&Y look at its tax accrual\n\nworkpapers, but did not allow E&Y to retain a copy of them.             Debra\n\nRaymond, a Textron tax manager, averred that she had reviewed E&Y's\n\nfiles and that E&Y did not in fact retain a copy of Textron's\n\nworkpapers.\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f          The IRS subpoena also requested any tax-accrual documents\n\nprepared by E&Y regarding Textron.        After the evidentiary hearing,\n\nthe district court found that the \"tax accrual workpapers\" at issue\n\ndid not include facts about the issues they identified, and could\n\nbe described as follows:\n\n          1. A spreadsheet that contains:\n          (a) lists of items on Textron's tax returns,\n          which, in the opinion of Textron's counsel,\n          involve issues on which the tax laws are\n          unclear, and, therefore, may be challenged by\n          the IRS;\n          (b) estimates by Textron's counsel expressing,\n          in percentage terms, their judgments regarding\n          Textron's chances of prevailing in any\n          litigation over those issues (the \"hazards of\n          litigation percentages\"); and\n          (c) the dollar amounts reserved to reflect the\n          possibility that Textron might not prevail in\n          such litigation (the \"tax reserve amounts\").\n\n          2. Backup workpapers consisting of the\n          previous year's spreadsheet and earlier drafts\n          of the spreadsheet together with notes and\n          memoranda written by Textron's in-house tax\n          attorneys reflecting their opinions as to\n          which items should be included on the\n          spreadsheet and the hazard of litigation\n          percentage that should apply to each item.\n\nUnited States v.

The government objects on appeal that the district court\n\ndid not include in this definition any tax accrual workpaper that\n\nE&Y prepared in its audit of Textron.\n\n          The   district   court   then    found   that   the   subpoenaed\n\ndocuments were relevant, requested for a proper purpose, and were\n\nprivileged attorney-client communications.

Id. at 151-52.\n\n          As to the work-product protection claim, the district\n\ncourt credited Textron's testimony that its ultimate purpose in\n\npreparing the tax accrual workpapers was to ensure that it was\n\n\"'adequately reserved with respect to any potential disputes or\n\nlitigation that would happen in the future.'\"       Id. at 143 (quoting\n\nthe testimony of Norman Richter). The court found that this desire\n\nto ensure adequate reserves was also prompted, in part, by its wish\n\nto satisfy independent auditors that Textron had properly reported\n\nits financial information. Id. at 150. The court acknowledged the\n\nFirst Circuit's \"because of\" test for determining whether documents\n\nwere prepared in anticipation of litigation and recognized that\n\nunder that test there is no protection for \"'documents that are\n\nprepared in the ordinary course of business or that would have been\n\ncreated   in   essentially   similar   form    irrespective    of   the\n\nlitigation.'\" Id.

The district court\n\nreasoned that while the papers were used to obtain a favorable\n\nopinion letter from E&Y regarding Textron's reserves, there would\n\nhave been no need for such reserves \"if Textron had not anticipated\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fa dispute with the IRS that was likely to result in litigation or\n\nsome other adversarial proceeding.\"               Id.    The IRS appeals the\n\nconclusion that the work-product doctrine protects the tax accrual\n\nworkpapers.\n\n            The district court then noted that the standard for\n\nwaiver of the work-product protection was different than for\n\nattorney-client     privilege.    Id.        at   152.    The   district   court\n\nconcluded that disclosure of Textron's tax accrual workpapers to\n\nE&Y did not effect a waiver since disclosure \"did not substantially\n\nincrease the IRS's opportunity to obtain the information contained\n\nin them.\"      Id. at 153.   The district court based its decision on\n\nE&Y's professional confidentiality obligations and the fact that\n\nE&Y averred that it had not actually disclosed the information.\n\nId.2    The IRS also appeals this conclusion.\n\n            The district court then ruled that the government could\n\nnot make the showing needed to overcome work-product protection\n\nsince    the    government   sought     Textron's        \"mental   impressions,\n\nconclusions, opinions or legal theories.\"                Id. at 154 (internal\n\nquotations omitted).     The IRS does not appeal this conclusion.\n\n\n\n\n2\n   The district court also found that E&Y had promised to keep the\ndocuments confidential. The IRS contends that this fact is not\nsupported in the record.    As explained infra n.9, we need not\ndecide this dispute.\n\n                                      -10-\n\f                               II.

The IRS is\n\ncorrect that preparation and filing of returns relies on good faith\n\nself-reporting.       But, good-faith disputes regarding the proper\n\napplication of tax law also arise during the audit process.            Thus,\n\nthough the initial processing of these disputes in the audit\n\nprocess   may   not    be    adversarial,    the   disputes   themselves   are\n\nessentially adversarial; the subject of these disputes will become\n\nthe subject of litigation unless the dispute is resolved.3\n\n                      3.    Were the tax accrual workpapers prepared in\n                             anticipation of litigation?\n\n           In addition to the question of whether audit disputes\n\nwith the IRS are litigation, we must confront the question of\n\nwhether   Textron's         tax   accrual    workpapers   are   prepared    in\n\nanticipation of such disputes.          The district court reasoned that\n\nthe business need to cover potential liabilities arose out of the\n\nanticipation of potential disputes, and thus would not occur \"but\n\n\n3\n  Thus, we do not hold that filing tax returns or participating in\naudits is itself adversarial. Our holding does not and should not\nchange the essentiality of good faith self-assessment. The IRS\nretains many enforcement tools to ensure compliance with that\nsystem. Thus, we do not share in the IRS's negative conclusions\nabout the policy effects of our judgment, which concerns tax\naccrual workpapers, documents which the IRS admits it seeks only in\nlimited circumstances.\n\n                                      -15-\n\ffor\" those disputes.

As the district court explained, the need to\n\nestimate the likelihood of success in litigation was a result of\n\nthe need to set up a reserve fund to cover tax positions for which\n\nTextron could foresee disputes with the IRS.\n\n             Of course, simple relation to litigation is insufficient\n\nto    trigger   work-product         protection.

Supp. 2d at 150 (recognizing that though \"it may be\naccurate to say that the workpapers helped Textron determine what\namount should be reserved to cover any potential tax liabilities,\"\nanticipation of disputes drove that very need).

These findings were based on testimony from\nTextron's witnesses. The testimony of the government's expert,\ncited by the dissent, does not contradict the conclusion that\nTextron was motivated by dual purposes, especially considering that\nit is not clear that the expert is using the same definition of\n\"anticipation of litigation\" that we adopt. See infra. Thus, the\ndistrict court's fact finding was not clearly erroneous. Rather,\nit is accurate to say that Textron's tax accrual workpapers would\nnot have been prepared in a similar form irrespective of the\npotential for litigation.\n\n                                        -17-\n\freasoning as a way of expressing its conclusion that the documents\n\nwould not have been prepared irrespective of the prospect of\n\nlitigation, but rather were prepared \"because of\" the risk of\n\ndisputes and litigation which gave rise to a need to compute and\n\nreport tax reserves.5\n\n           The IRS next argues that the district court found that\n\nthe \"workpapers helped Textron determine what amount should be\n\nreserved to cover any potential tax liabilities and that the\n\nworkpapers were useful in obtaining a 'clean' opinion from E&Y\n\nregarding the adequacy of the reserve amount.\"             Textron, 507 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 150.    The IRS argues that this finding legally compels\n\na ruling that the tax accrual workpapers are not protected, since\n\ndocuments prepared in the ordinary course of business receive no\n\nprotection.     Maine, 298 F.3d at 70.   The IRS further reasons that\n\nsince the documents were required to comply with reporting and\n\nsecurities obligations, the tax accrual workpapers were prepared\n\npursuant   to    \"regulatory   requirements\"   and   are    therefore   not\n\nprotected.

But that is not the context in which the\nworkpapers at issue in this case were created.        Rather, the\nevidence shows that these workpapers project the risks of\nlitigation over specific tax positions and were created in the\ncontext   of   anticipating  disputes   (and  therefore   possible\nlitigation) over those positions.\n\n                                  -18-\n\f\"[m]aterials assembled in the ordinary course of business, or\n\npursuant to public requirements unrelated to litigation, or for\n\nother nonlitigation purposes.\"              Fed.

As\nexplained infra, such an approach ignores the primary distinction\nbetween the \"because of\" and the \"primary purpose\" test.\n\n     The IRS also points to another decision in this circuit where\nthe district court analyzed opinion letters regarding investment\nvehicles alleged to be tax shelters.

But that court did not\nhold \"dual purpose\" documents unprotected. Rather, it essentially\nmade a factual call, which we do not now judge, that the\npossibility of litigation was too remote. Id. As explained, infra\nSection II.A.4, in the present case the context surrounding the\ncreation of the documents, namely the need to estimate reserve\nfunds, made it reasonable for Textron to foresee and analyze\nlitigation.\n\n                                     -20-\n\f134 F.3d at 1200 (describing hypothetical examples where work-\n\nproduct protection applies), here the business purpose derives from\n\nand is inextricably related to anticipating litigation.

In arguing against this conclusion, the IRS points to\n\na Third Circuit case where that court instructed the district court\n\non remand to assess whether a tax reserve file was prepared to\n\nassist in litigation or to comply with securities requirements.\n\nUnited States v.

In the present case, however, the district court has\n\nalready   conducted    such    analysis     and    has   concluded      that    the\n\nworkpapers were created because of both purposes.\n\n            The dissent disagrees with this legal conclusion and\n\nrelies primarily on the language in Maine that \"the 'because of'\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fstandard does not protect from disclosure 'documents that are\n\nprepared in the ordinary course of business or that would have been\n\ncreated    in   essentially   similar   form   irrespective   of   the\n\nlitigation.'\"    Maine, 298 F.3d at 70 (quoting Adlman, 134 F.3d at\n\n1202).    Based on this language, the dissent charges we are going\n\nagainst established circuit precedent.         But, for the reasons\n\ndescribed above, it is error to read this \"ordinary course of\n\nbusiness\" language as implying that all documents prepared with\n\nsome business purpose in mind are necessarily unprotected.         The\n\ncourt in Maine was not confronted with dual purpose documents like\n\nthose at issue here.    Rather, that court recited the above quoted\n\nlanguage in the course of holding that there was insufficient\n\ninformation to see if the documents at issue were prepared for\n\nlitigation or rather in the ordinary course of business.           Id.\n\nThus, Maine's \"ordinary course of business\" language should not be\n\nread as barring protection for dual purpose documents where one\n\nbusiness purpose is present. This conclusion is all the more clear\n\nwhen one consider's Adlman's reason for adopting the \"because of\"\n\ntest:\n\n           The issue is less clear, however, as to\n           documents which, although prepared because of\n           expected litigation, are intended to inform a\n           business decision influenced by the prospects\n           of the litigation. The formulation applied by\n           some courts in determining whether documents\n           are protected by work-product privilege is\n           whether they are prepared \"primarily or\n           exclusively to assist in litigation\" -- a\n           formulation that would potentially exclude\n\n                                 -22-\n\f          documents containing analysis of expected\n          litigation, if their primary, ultimate, or\n          exclusive purpose is to assist in making the\n          business decision. Others ask whether the\n          documents were prepared \"because of\" existing\n          or expected litigation -- a formulation that\n          would include such documents, despite the fact\n          that their purpose is not to \"assist in\"\n          litigation. Because we believe that protection\n          of documents of this type is more consistent\n          with both the literal terms and the purposes\n          of the Rule, we adopt the latter formulation.\n\nAdlman, 134 F.3d at 1197-98, quoted in part in Maine, 298 F.3d at\n\n68.\n\n          Further, a contrary holding would lead to undesirable\n\nresults in other cases.    Consider a document prepared to analyze a\n\nspecific litigation in order to compute for an auditor how much\n\nmust be retained in a litigation reserve fund.          Were we to adopt\n\nthe IRS position that documents created to satisfy audit reporting\n\nresponsibilities   were   not   protected,   opposing   counsel   in   the\n\nlitigation might be able to discover such a memo, effectively\n\ndisclosing counsel's ultimate mental impression of the case.            In\n\nfact, in similar circumstances, the Sixth and Second circuits have\n\nsuggested that memoranda analyzing a transaction or position to be\n\nprotected by the work-product doctrine.

The Court also rejected some of the fairness\n\nconcerns implicated in that case.

But\n\nunlike the Court in Arthur Young, we are not now confronted with\n\nthe question of whether to recognize a new privilege.                Here, the\n\ndoctrinal decision we face is whether to afford protection to\n\ndocuments created because of both business and litigation -- a\n\nquestion not presented in Arthur Young.7               Since this question has\n\n\n\n7\n   The IRS also suggests that the Supreme Court was comfortable\nwith discovery of taxpayer tax accrual workpapers because it\n\"affirmatively encouraged the IRS's seeking tax-accrual workpapers\nfrom the company prior to pursuing such workpapers from the\nauditor.\" IRS Reply Brief at 22-23 (citing Arthur Young, 465 U.S.\nat 820-21 & n.17). But the cited provisions of Arthur Young do not\nconsider the question of work-product protection, and do not\nendorse any particular method, but rather simply take note that the\nIRS \"has demonstrated administrative sensitivity\" by adopting a\npolicy to \"take all reasonable means to secure the information from\nthe corporation itself before issuing a summons to the independent\nauditor.\"    Arthur Young, 465 U.S. at 21 n.17.       Whether such\n\"reasonable means\" can include summons of a taxpayer's own tax\naccrual workpapers was not considered by the Supreme Court.\n\n                                      -25-\n\fbroader implications, the Supreme Court's policy judgment that a\n\nnew privilege is not necessary for the accurate preparation of\n\naccountants' tax accrual workpapers is not controlling.               Further,\n\nour prior analysis of this issue does not rely on the policy\n\nconsiderations rejected in Arthur Young.                 That case is not an\n\nobstacle   to       our   conclusion    that    protection   of   dual-purpose\n\ndocuments is consistent with the purpose and doctrine of the work-\n\nproduct doctrine.\n\n                                  ii.

The tax pool analysis concocts\n           theories about the results of possible\n           litigation; such analyses are not designed to\n           prepare   a   specific  case   for  trial   or\n           negotiation. Their sole function, from all\n           that appears in the record, is to back up a\n           figure on a financial balance sheet. Written\n           ultimately to comply with SEC regulations, the\n           tax pool analysis carries much more the aura\n           of daily business than it does of courtroom\n           combat. We hold, therefore, that the tax pool\n           analysis    and  backup  memoranda   are   not\n           protected work product materials.\n\n                                        -26-\n\fId. at 543-44.     However, in El Paso the Fifth Circuit applied a\n\ndifferent definition of the work-product doctrine, asking whether\n\nthe \"primary motivating purpose behind the creation of the document\n\nwas to aid in possible future litigation.\"         Id. at 542 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).      Thus, the result here does not create a\n\ncircuit split with El Paso, but is merely the application of an\n\nexisting   split   in    the   definition   of   the   \"anticipation     of\n\nlitigation.\"   It is precisely in these \"dual purpose\" situations\n\nthat the \"because of\" test used in this circuit distinguishes\n\nitself from the \"primary purpose\" test used in the Fifth Circuit.\n\nMaine, 298 F.3d at 68 (citing Adlman for the proposition that the\n\nprimary purpose test \"is at odds with the text and the policies of\n\nRule 26 because nothing in it suggests that documents prepared for\n\ndual purposes of litigation and business or agency decisions do not\n\nfall within its scope\").       Thus, unlike the Fifth Circuit, we need\n\nnot assess whether the tax accrual workpapers carry more of one\n\naura than another.      We need only conclude that since the analysis\n\nwas undertaken \"because of\" the anticipation of litigation, work-\n\nproduct protection applies.\n\n                                iii.   Factual argument\n\n           Since some tax positions in the accrual papers carry a\n\n100 percent chance of failing, the IRS argues, as a factual matter,\n\nthat Textron could not have been anticipating litigation.              But,\n\nTextron explained that those entries were the result of identifying\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fpositions that were incorrect as a result of subsequent legal\n\ndevelopments.    The IRS also argues that most disputes are resolved\n\ninformally.     But the fact that most disputes are resolved before\n\nlitigation commences does not mean that analysis of those disputes\n\ncould not have been in anticipation of \"the prospect of litigation\"\n\nover those disputes.      To the contrary, assessing the likelihood\n\nthat a tax position will not withstand scrutiny necessarily entails\n\nanalysis which anticipates how litigation of that position would be\n\nresolved.\n\n                   4.    Has   Textron  adequately   identified the\n                         specific litigation for which the workpapers\n                         were prepared?\n\n            Adlman and Roxworthy, cases we relied on above, are also\n\nnot directly on point as they involved documents analyzing the\n\nconsequences of a specific litigation or specific transaction. The\n\nIRS argues that this distinction is controlling, that to protect\n\nTextron's tax accrual workpapers is in effect to afford a \"blanket\"\n\nprotection -- a work-product doctrine that is so broad it will\n\n\"swallow\" the attorney-client privilege.         It is true that we have\n\nrequired    proponents   of   a   work-product    protection   claim   to\n\n\"'identify the litigation for which the document was created . . .\n\nand explain why the work-product privilege applies to all portions\n\nof the document.'\"       Maine, 298 F.3d at 69 (quoting Church of\n\nScientology Int'l v. United States Dep't of Justice, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195518\"><a href=\"/opinion/195518/church-v-doj/\"><span class=\"volume\">30</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">224</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n237 (1st Cir. 1994)).         These \"identification and explanation\n\n\n                                  -28-\n\frequirements are not to be given a hypertechnical construction,\"\n\nbut \"they can neither be brushed aside nor satisfied by vague\n\ngeneralities.\"     Id.\n\n           Here, Textron has met its burden.                      The tax accrual\n\nworkpapers identify and numerically evaluate a number of tax\n\npositions Textron took on its 2001 returns.                  As described above,\n\nTextron has shown that its analysis of each position was prepared\n\nby anticipating the possibility of litigation with the IRS arising\n\nover a dispute regarding that position.                    Thus, the tax accrual\n\nworkpapers     identify    specific       positions,        and    the     litigation\n\nprojections were created in anticipation of disputes and possible\n\nlitigation over those positions.8\n\n           The    IRS    again     argues      that   Textron      could    not    have\n\nconsistently     had    specific      litigation      in   mind    since    most   tax\n\ndisputes were resolved before litigation and since Textron could\n\nnot reasonably intend to litigate every challenged position.                       But\n\nthese facts do not change our analysis.                    As the district court\n\nfound,   the   spreadsheet       at    issue    assessed     the    likelihood       of\n\nsucceeding in litigation over each specific position.                      Thus, the\n\n\n\n8\n   The IRS posits that some entries in the tax accrual workpapers\nmay refer to reserves held for deferred taxes over which no\nlitigation is to be expected. That some reserves may not be based\non disputes does not change our conclusion regarding computation of\nreserves that are based on potential disputes. Further, the IRS\nhas not requested that we order the production of only the papers\nregarding deferred tax reserves, which in any event, would not\nappear to be relevant to assisting the IRS.\n\n                                        -29-\n\ffunction served by creating this analysis is to assess what funds\n\nmust be set aside in anticipation of litigation over each of the\n\npositions identified.    That Textron might ultimately decide not to\n\ndispute a specific position does not contradict the conclusion that\n\nwhen it estimated its litigation success, it was anticipating\n\nspecific litigation.\n\n            Again, we note that a contrary result would lead to an\n\nundesirable result.       If we were only to afford work product\n\nprotection over documents of this sort by requiring a showing, as\n\nthe   IRS   suggests,   that   there   was   some   specific   quantum   of\n\nexpectation that the position at issue would mature into full-\n\nfledged litigation, we would essentially be offering protection\n\nonly to the cantankerous and combative taxpayer who intends to\n\nthoroughly litigate every position.\n\n            Precedent does suggest that a party claiming work-product\n\nprotection must \"'have had a subjective belief that litigation was\n\na real possibility, and that belief must have been objectively\n\nreasonable.'\"    Roxworthy, 457 F.3d at 594 (quoting In re Sealed\n\nCase, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"184564\"><a href=\"/opinion/184564/in-re-sealed-case/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">881</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 888 (D.C. Cir. 1998)).            The district court\n\nfound that, considering its history, it was reasonable for Textron\n\nto conclude that litigation with the IRS was likely.           We see the\n\nmatter differently but reach the same result.\n\n            In the context of these facts, we do not think that a\n\nhistory of litigation with the IRS should be the deciding factor.\n\n\n                                  -30-\n\fA company with a history of challenging the IRS creates these\n\ndocuments \"because of\" the same reason as another company without\n\nsuch a history: the possibility of a dispute compels them to\n\nanticipate litigation so as to prepare and assess their tax reserve\n\nfunds.   In this case, the anticipation of litigation coupled with\n\nsecurities and reporting requirements forced Textron to analyze and\n\nproject its likelihood of success in litigation. Thus, Textron was\n\neffectively forced to operate under the hypothetical belief that\n\nlitigation    would    occur.      For   this    reason,    regardless   of   its\n\nspecific history with the IRS, it was objectively reasonable for\n\nTextron to forecast litigation.\n\n             The IRS argues that this holding will \"immunize nearly\n\nevery document generated by lawyers because clients can always be\n\nsaid to be aware of possible litigation.\"               The IRS worries that\n\nwork-product protection would \"encompass essentially all legal\n\nadvice,\" since any lawyer analyzing the risks inherent in a legal\n\ntransaction    or     position    will   be     able   to   gain   work-product\n\nprotection by saying that the analysis was prepared in anticipation\n\nof litigation regarding that transaction or position. We disagree.\n\nAs we have just explained, in the case of tax accrual workpapers,\n\nthe   dual    purposes    --     financial      reporting    and   anticipating\n\nlitigation    --    are   necessarily     intertwined;       the   function   of\n\npreparing adequate financial reports inherently requires Textron to\n\nanticipate and analyze litigation.            The anticipation of litigation\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\fmay be similarly intertwined in other cases.             See, e.g., Delaney,\n\nMigdail & Young, Chartered v. IRS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"492617\"><a href=\"/opinion/492617/delaney-migdail-young-chartered-v-internal-revenue-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">826</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 127 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1987) (distinguishing case law requiring a \"specific claim\" to\n\nuphold a claim of work-product protection to certain IRS memoranda\n\nanalyzing potential legal vulnerabilities).              But in many cases,\n\nthere will not be an obvious objectively reasonable need to foresee\n\nlitigation.9    Of course, each case will depend on its facts.           See,\n\ne.g., Adlman, 134 F.3d at 1204 (remanding for further fact finding\n\napplying the correct standard).               But, in the present case, we\n\nconclude   that   Textron's     need    to    consider   the   possibility   of\n\nlitigation     with   respect   to   each     disputed   position   adequately\n\nsatisfies this requirement.\n\n\n9\n    For example, the IRS argues that protecting Textron's tax\naccrual papers would lead to protection of documents prepared by a\nbank to estimate loan failure rates. We disagree. A loan may fail\nfor all sorts of reasons. Tax positions would ultimately succeed\nor fall based on their legal merit, assessed through litigation.\nIn this case, the combination of the possibility of litigation and\nreporting requirements required Textron to anticipate litigation.\nLegal analysis of other transactions and positions may not entail\nsuch specific consideration of litigation.\n\n     The IRS also fears our holding will somehow lead companies to\nuse lawyers to conduct performance reviews, then seek work-product\nprotection for such documents. We think such a hypothetical is\ndistinguishable. In such a case, the employer may be evaluating\nthe employee's performance for business purposes, regardless of the\npossibility of litigation.      Here, Textron evaluates its tax\npositions for business purposes precisely because of the\npossibility those positions will be challenged in litigation.\nThus, the business context makes it reasonable for Textron to\nanticipate and foresee litigation.     While such a question is a\nfactual matter for another case, it seems less likely that the\nfunction of employee evaluations would similarly make it reasonable\nfor an employer to anticipate litigation.\n\n                                       -32-\n\f          B.     Waiver of Work-Product Protection\n\n          Unlike        attorney-client         privilege,        \"work    product\n\nprotection is provided against 'adversaries,' so only disclosing\n\nmaterial in a way inconsistent with keeping it from an adversary\n\nwaives   work    product     protection.\"          MIT,     129    F.3d   at   687.\n\nSpecifically, \"disclosure to an adversary, real or potential,\n\nforfeits work product protection.\" Id.\n\n          We     must   decide     whether    Textron     waived     work-product\n\nprotection by showing its tax accrual workpapers to E&Y, its\n\nindependent     auditor.     A   number    of    district    court    cases    have\n\nconcluded that disclosure to independent auditors does not waive\n\nwork-product     protection.        See,     e.g.,   Regions       Fin.

It is\n\nundisputed that Textron and E&Y were not actual adversaries.        The\n\nIRS argues by analogy to MIT that they were potential adversaries.\n\nIn MIT, we found work-product privilege waived when MIT disclosed\n\ndocuments to a Defense Department auditing agency.         128 F.3d at\n\n687. The audit agency was reviewing MIT's expense submissions.

While   the   Defense\n\nDepartment auditing agency was reviewing expenses to determine if\n\nit would challenge those expenses, E&Y was not auditing Textron in\n\norder to identify disputes it would have with Textron, but rather,\n\nto decide if it could issue a letter certifying Textron's financial\n\nstatements.     This is a cooperative not adversarial relationship.\n\nSee Jaffe Pension Plan, 237 F.R.D. at 183 (\"[T]he fact that an\n\nindependent auditor must remain independent from the company it\n\naudits does not establish that the auditor also has an adversarial\n\nrelationship with the client as contemplated by the work product\n\ndoctrine.\").

Raytheon,   218    F.R.D.    at   360\n\n(collecting cases).     In other words, waiver occurs upon disclosure\n\nto a third party that \"substantially increased the opportunities\n\nfor potential adversaries to obtain the information.\" 8 Wright,\n\nMiller,   &   Marcus,   supra,   ยง    2024    (2008).         Though    E&Y   has\n\nprofessional confidentiality obligations limiting disclosure, the\n\nIRS argues that it may be required to turn documents over to the\n\nSEC and may, in some circumstances, have a duty to disclose\n\ninformation to protect stockholders. See Arthur Young, 465 U.S. at\n\n817-18 (\"The independent public accountant performing this special\n\nfunction owes ultimate allegiance to the corporation's creditors\n\nand stockholders, as well as to the investing public.\").\n\n           The IRS also argues that E&Y may be required to disclose\n\nthis information in response to a valid subpoena. At first glance,\n\nthis argument seems circular: a subpoena would only be valid if the\n\n\n                                     -35-\n\fprotection did not survive.     But, on further examination, the\n\nquestion is more complicated.   The record establishes that E&Y did\n\nnot retain a copy of Textron's tax accrual workpapers.     Thus, at\n\nfirst we would see little likelihood that E&Y would have to\n\ndisclose those papers.   But, E&Y used those papers, together with\n\nits own expertise, in preparing its own assessment of Textron's\n\nreserve tax liability.    Therefore, the only remaining documents\n\nwhich could be subjected to a risk of discovery are E&Y's own\n\nassessments, which incorporate Textron's analysis.\n\n          Though we hold Textron's tax accrual workpapers are\n\nprotected, Arthur Young suggests that E&Y's workpapers may be\n\ndiscoverable.   465 U.S. at 815-821.10   In fact, as we find infra,\n\nTextron itself may be required to produce E&Y's workpapers on\n\nremand.\n\n          Since E&Y's workpapers may be discoverable, the question\n\nwe must ask is whether disclosure of those workpapers substantially\n\nincreased the risk that the contents of Textron's workpapers would\n\nbe disclosed to an adversary. As the Supreme Court has recognized,\n\nindependent auditors \"obtain and assess the opinions, speculations,\n\nand projections of management with regard to unclear, aggressive,\n\nor questionable tax positions that may have been taken on prior tax\n\n\n10\n     Though the parties debate the extent of confidentiality\nagreements and expectations of privacy between Textron and E&Y, we\nfind such expectations irrelevant here, since a bilateral\nconfidentiality agreement regarding Textron's workpapers would not\ndefeat a valid IRS subpoena for E&Y's workpapers.\n\n                                -36-\n\freturns.\"     Arthur Young, 465 U.S. at 812.       Further the auditor's\n\nworkpapers \"may document the auditor's interviews with corporate\n\npersonnel.\" Id. (emphasis added).          Thus, disclosure of E&Y's\n\nworkpapers might reveal Textron's own analysis. On the other hand,\n\nE&Y's affiant, Weston, suggested that E&Y \"did not rely solely upon\n\nthe conclusions of [Textron's] tax counsel\" but instead \"applied\n\nits own professional knowledge and judgment.\" Because the district\n\ncourt did not address the question of whether the IRS can gain\n\ndiscovery of E&Y's tax workpapers through a subpoena to Textron, it\n\nmade no factual findings regarding the actual contents of E&Y's\n\nworkpapers or the extent to which disclosure of such workpapers\n\nwould   effectively     constitute    disclosure     of   Textron's   own\n\nassessment.      Rather than rely on vague language suggesting what\n\nmight be in E&Y's workpapers, we think that this is a question the\n\ndistrict court must develop on remand through in camera inspection,\n\nif feasible, or through testimony.\n\n            C.   E&Y's Workpapers\n\n            The IRS's subpoena also sought tax accrual workpapers\n\nprepared by E&Y that were within the possession, custody, or\n\ncontrol of Textron or its accountants.      The district court did not\n\ninclude such workpapers in its definition of the documents sought\n\nand so did not rule on their discoverability.       The IRS asserts that\n\nsuch failure to rule is error.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -37-\n\f             Textron argues that this omission is the fault of the\n\nIRS.   When convening the evidentiary hearing, the district court\n\ncalled on the parties to present evidence on the question of\n\n\"[w]hat specific types of documents are included in the 'Tax\n\nAccrual Workpapers' and 'backup' documentation\" sought by the\n\nsummons.      But the evidence at the evidentiary hearing simply\n\nconcerned Textron's workpapers, and the IRS did not bring up E&Y's\n\nworkpapers.        Textron thus argues that the IRS should not be\n\npermitted to now challenge the scope of the district court's\n\nconstruction of the summons.

In   other   words,     since     the   IRS   \"squarely    and\n\ndistinctly\" requested E&Y's workpapers, and the district court was\n\non notice of the issue, the argument is not waived.

Textron has provided us with no argument why that test\n\nshould not apply in the IRS subpoena context.\n\n           Textron argues that its witness testified that Textron\n\ncould not access the documents.        But Textron mischaracterizes the\n\nrecord. Textron's witness simply testified that E&Y did not give\n\nTextron its workpapers, not that Textron could not obtain copies of\n\n\n                                     -39-\n\fthe documents upon request.     Thus Textron has no evidence showing\n\nthat it did not have the ability to demand the documents.          Textron\n\nargues that R.I. Gen. Laws ยง 5-3.1-22 establishes an independent\n\nauditor owns its own workpapers. But, again, it does not establish\n\nthat Textron does not have the ability or contractual right to\n\nrequest the documents.\n\n          The IRS has some evidence to suggest that Textron may\n\nhave had the right to demand E&Y's workpapers.      Raymond, a Textron\n\nwitness, stated that she had reviewed E&Y's files to confirm that\n\nE&Y did not retain Textron's workpapers.     The IRS argues that this\n\nshows Textron has the right to obtain the documents.               Textron\n\nargues it shows only a right to temporary access.          We need not\n\nparse this testimony, since even adopting Textron's interpretation,\n\nwe could not affirm on this basis.         Textron has the burden of\n\nshowing a lack of control and has produced no evidence to meet this\n\nburden.   United States v.

Arthur Young, 465 U.S. at 818-19.\n\n            And, while it may seem one-sided to give the government\n\nTextron's blue print to weaknesses in Textron's tax returns, the\n\nreturn     is   massive--constituting    more   than   4000   pages;    the\n\ngovernment has an important interest in collecting taxes that are\n\nowed; and its inquiries into work papers were focused on a specific\n\ntype of transaction that had been shown to be open to abuse.             So\n\ncontext should be kept in mind before shedding too many tears for\n\nTextron.\n\n            In all events, it is important for us to adhere to the\n\nexisting rules of the road.      Parties can generally adjust their\n\nbehavior so long as they know what privilege rules apply.              Here,\n\nthe governing rubric in Maine (First Circuit) and Adlman (Second\n\n\n                                  -49-\n\fCircuit) and a precise precedent in El Paso (Fifth Circuit) govern\n\nthis case.   An en banc court could change the rule; a panel\n\nmajority cannot.\n\n\n\n\n                              -50-\n\f</pre>",
