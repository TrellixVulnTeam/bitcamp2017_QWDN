Riley, Lauren F. Goldberg, and Kopelman and\nPaige, P.C. on brief for appellee Elizabeth L. Delaney.\n\n\n                         October 8, 2004\n\f               LYNCH, Circuit Judge. Richard McClure filed suit against\n\nthe Secretary of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and others,\n\nalleging an interference with both his right to vote and his right\n\nto    run   for    political    office   under   the   First   and   Fourteenth\n\nAmendments of the United States Constitution. He sought injunctive\n\nand declaratory relief, requiring that he be placed on the ballot\n\nas an independent candidate in the race for a state senate seat.1\n\n               In March of 2004, McClure had sought certification from\n\na town clerk to be placed on the ballot as an unenrolled candidate\n\nfor    state      senate   in   Massachusetts.     \"Unenrolled\"      means   not\n\naffiliated with any political party.             The town clerk refused to\n\nissue the certification because McClure had voted in the Democratic\n\nparty presidential primary on March 2, 2004.             Pursuant to a state\n\nstatute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, § 37, such voting automatically\n\nenrolled McClure as a Democrat. Pursuant to another state statute,\n\nch. 53, § 6, one running for an in-state office as an independent\n\nmust not be enrolled in a political party for the ninety days\n\npreceding the filing deadline for primaries for candidates running\n\nfor state senate.          As a result, McClure's temporary enrollment\n\nautomatically disqualified him from running for the state senate as\n\n\n       1\n      McClure's wife, Martha McClure, was also named as a plaintiff\nin the suit and submitted an affidavit. She alleges that she was,\nby virtue of her husband's exclusion, prohibited from voting for\nthe candidate whose political beliefs are most in line with her\nown, and she claimed to be suing on behalf of all other voters\nsimilarly situated. We do not discuss her claims further as they\nmake no difference in the disposition of the case.\n\n                                         -2-\n\fan independent because the deadline for filing an intent to run for\n\nthat office was less than ninety days after the date of the\n\nDemocratic primary in which he voted.\n\n          The district court, after an expedited hearing, denied\n\nMcClure's motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed his\n\nclaim on May 17, 2004.   McClure v. Galvin, No. Civ.A. 04-CV-10826-\n\nRGS, 2004 WL 1092325, at *4 (D. Mass. May 17, 2004).        We now affirm\n\nthis judgment.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          The    statutory   scheme    at   issue   here   requires   some\n\nelaboration.\n\n          Massachusetts General Laws chapter 53, section 6 provides\n\nthat an unenrolled candidate for elected office will not have her\n\nname printed on the ballot unless a certificate confirming this\n\nunenrolled status is obtained from the registrar of voters of the\n\ntown where the would-be candidate is a registered voter.          Such a\n\ncertification will not be granted \"to any such candidate who shall\n\nhave been an enrolled member of any political party during the time\n\nprior to the last day for filing nomination papers as provided in\n\nsection ten, and on or after the day by which a primary candidate\n\nis required by section forty-eight to establish enrollment in a\n\npolitical party.\"   Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, § 6.       In turn, chapter\n\n53, section 48 states that an enrolled candidate seeking to enter\n\na party primary must have been a member of that party for the\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fninety days before the filing deadline for that primary, which is\n\nthe \"last Tuesday in May\" for candidates for state senate.               The\n\nbeginning    date   of    the   nonenrollment    period   for   independent\n\ncandidates is thus ninety days prior to the last Tuesday in May.\n\nNext, chapter 53, section 10 establishes the \"last Tuesday in May\"\n\nas the deadline for filing candidacies for in-state offices for the\n\ngeneral elections, and the last Tuesday in May thus acts as the\n\nending date for the nonenrollment period.            The effect of chapter\n\n53, section 6 in 2004 was to require unenrolled candidates seeking\n\na place on the ballot for state senate not to have been enrolled as\n\na member of any political party between February 24, 2004, and May\n\n25, 2004.      This year, the state presidential primary was held\n\nwithin the ninety-day period.\n\n            The nonenrollment period for independent candidates for\n\nstate-wide    (e.g.,     governor)   and   federal   (e.g.,   United   States\n\nSenator) offices begins one week later, ninety days prior to the\n\nfirst Tuesday in June.       Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, § 48.      The ninety-\n\nday period thus did not include the presidential primaries for\n\nindividuals running for these offices.\n\n             A similar scheme is in place for enrolled candidates.\n\nSee Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, § 48 (individual seeking ballot\n\nplacement for elected office as a member of any party, and who thus\n\nseeks to run in a party primary, needs a certificate \"certifying\n\nthat he has been enrolled as a member of the political party whose\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fnomination he seeks throughout the ninety days prior to the last\n\nday herein provided for filing nomination papers [for the primary]\n\nwith the state secretary. . . .\").                    In fact, since section 6\n\nincorporates section 48 by reference, the beginning date of the\n\nperiod within which candidates running for a given office under a\n\nparty banner must have been a member of that party is the exact\n\nsame    date    as     the    beginning   date   of    the   period   within   which\n\nunenrolled candidates must not have been enrolled as a member of\n\nany party.       For state senate candidates, this key date is ninety\n\ndays prior to the last Tuesday in May.                See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53,\n\n§ 48.\n\n               Massachusetts General Laws chapter 53, section 37 as\n\ncurrently in effect states that voters who are unenrolled at the\n\ntime of appearing to vote in a primary may generally vote in any\n\nparty's primary.             Upon appearing to vote in a primary, a ballot\n\nclerk asks unenrolled voters in which primary they \"desire[] to\n\nvote\"; they may then vote in that primary.                Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53,\n\n§ 37.    Generally, an unenrolled voter can vote in party primaries\n\nwithout losing her unenrolled status.\n\n               There     is    an   exception,    however,      for   presidential\n\nprimaries; in a presidential primary, upon voting, \"the voter shall\n\nbecome enrolled in and shall remain a member of the political party\n\nwhose ballot he received until he files a certificate, signed under\n\nthe pains and penalties of perjury, with the board of registrars of\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fvoters, requesting to have his enrollment changed to another party\n\nor political designation or cancelled . . . .\"               Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n53, § 37.      The change of status back to unenrolled is effective\n\nonce the board receives the certificate.              See Mass. Gen. Laws ch.\n\n53, § 38.      There is no set amount of time that one must remain a\n\nmember   of    the    party   in   whose    primary    one    has   just   voted;\n\nunenrollment can take place immediately.\n\n              Before a 1994 amendment to chapter 53, section 37, all\n\nprimary voting by unenrolled voters (not simply such voting in\n\npresidential         primaries)    automatically        enrolled     previously\n\nunenrolled voters in that party.           See Mass. Gen. Laws Ann. ch. 53,\n\n§ 37, Historical and Statutory Notes.            Since the 1994 amendment,\n\nhowever, only the presidential primaries have had that effect; an\n\nunenrolled voter may vote in all other primaries without losing her\n\nunenrolled status.2\n\n              Voters currently enrolled in one party in Massachusetts\n\nmay not generally vote in any other party's primary, and they may\n\nnot switch their enrollment to another party within twenty days of\n\na primary.     Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, § 38.          One effect of these laws\n\nis that no voter in Massachusetts, enrolled or unenrolled, may vote\n\n\n     2\n      A recent amendment to section 37 will take effect on October\n13, 2004, fully opening up even the presidential primaries to\nunenrolled voters. Unenrolled voters will no longer have to enroll\nin a party, even temporarily, in order to vote in a presidential\nprimary.   Thus, the problem presented in this case should not\nrecur.\n\n                                      -6-\n\fin more than one party's primary on a given primary day.         See Mass.\n\nGen. Laws ch. 53, §§ 37, 38.\n\n          McClure    is    a   registered     voter    in      Chelmsford,\n\nMassachusetts, and was a registered Republican until February 10,\n\n2004; on that date he disenrolled and changed his status to\n\nunenrolled.   On March 2, 2004, McClure went to the polls to vote in\n\nthe Democratic party's presidential primary in Massachusetts.           In\n\nhis affidavit, he states that on that date, the ballot clerk asked\n\nhim in which party's presidential primary he would like to vote and\n\nwhen he asked for a Democratic party ballot, the clerk put a large\n\n\"D\" next to his name.     McClure then told the ballot clerk that he\n\ndid not want to enroll in the Democratic party; the clerk told him\n\nthat he would not be enrolled in the Democratic party and handed\n\nhim a \"certificate\" indicating that he was \"establishing [his]\n\nvoter status as 'unenrolled.'\" After voting, a different clerk (an\n\n\"exit clerk\") took this certificate from McClure.                Elizabeth\n\nDelaney, the town clerk of the Town of Chelmsford, stated, in her\n\naffidavit, that the effect of this certificate was merely to\n\nimmediately     change    McClure's     enrollment    status     back   to\n\n\"unenrolled.\"    However, he was briefly enrolled as a Democrat.\n\n          On March 25, 2004, McClure, having satisfied the other\n\nrequirements to be an unenrolled candidate for state senate whose\n\nname appears on the ballot, applied to the Chelmsford town clerk\n\nfor a voter registration certificate.        The town clerk had called\n\n                                  -7-\n\fhim the previous day (March 24) and told him over the phone that\n\nshe would not be able to grant such a certificate because McClure\n\nvoted in the Democratic presidential primary on March 2, 2004,\n\nwhich enrolled him as a Democrat within ninety days of the May 25\n\ndeadline for filing. In this conversation, McClure informed her of\n\nthe misinformation he received from the ballot clerk.                   The town\n\nclerk responded that the election laws are very complex, one cannot\n\nexpect a checker at the polls to understand all of their details,\n\nand McClure should have called her as chief election official if he\n\nhad any questions or doubts.              On March 26, 2004, the town clerk\n\nformally and in writing denied McClure's certificate.\n\n                                          II.\n\n            McClure     filed      suit    in    federal   district    court   in\n\nMassachusetts on April 26, 2004, alleging that the ninety-day\n\nenrollment restriction effectuated by Massachusetts General Laws\n\nchapter 53, sections 6 and 37 violated his First Amendment speech\n\nand association rights as a voter and as a candidate for public\n\noffice.     He also asserted that it violated his Equal Protection\n\nClause rights      because    it    constituted       invidious   discrimination\n\nagainst unenrolled voters.            He finally alleged both that the\n\nstatutory scheme itself gave unconstitutionally inadequate notice\n\nto McClure and that the negligence of various town and state\n\nofficials    led   to   a   similar       lack   of   notice.     McClure   sought\n\ndeclaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees.\n\n                                          -8-\n\f          Given the time constraints involved, the district court\n\ngranted McClure's motion for an expedited hearing on his motion for\n\na   preliminary    injunction,   and    then   denied    the   preliminary\n\ninjunction and dismissed the claim under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).\n\nMcClure, 2004 WL 1092325, at *1, *4.       The district court, relying\n\non the Supreme Court's decision in Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724\n\n(1974), held that McClure could not state a claim on the merits.\n\nMcClure, 2004 WL 1092325, at *2-*3. Storer upheld a California law\n\npreventing candidates from having their names placed on the ballot\n\nin a general election as independents if they had registered with\n\na political party at any time within one year prior to the date of\n\nthe primary election that preceded that general election.            Storer,\n\n415 U.S. at 728.    The district court held that the scheme at issue\n\nin Storer was identical in its relevant respects to the one at\n\nissue here, thus foreclosing the bulk of McClure's claim. McClure,\n\n2004 WL 1092325, at *2-*3.\n\n          The district court also held that McClure's attempt to\n\ndistinguish Storer failed; the fact that the scheme at issue here\n\nonly applied to presidential primaries and not to all primaries is\n\na \"distinction . . . without a meaningful difference\" because \"[i]t\n\nis impossible to see how a statute that places an even lesser\n\nburden on an independent voter who desires to seek public office\n\ncould be more violative of a voter's rights.\"           Id. at *3.   As for\n\nthe rest of McClure's claims (arguing lack of fair notice), the\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fcourt cited the principle that citizens are presumed to know the\n\nlaw and added that the ballot clerk's negligence provided no basis\n\nfor a viable estoppel claim.    Id.\n\n          McClure appealed the denial of the preliminary injunction\n\nand the dismissal of the claim to this court.          McClure has not,\n\nhowever, raised on appeal his claims of lack of fair notice or\n\nmisrepresentation by the ballot clerk; those claims are waived.\n\nThe only claim before this court is that the statutory scheme\n\nunduly burdens McClure's rights to vote and to run for office.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          Appellate   review   of     a   trial   court's   denial   of   a\n\npreliminary injunction is deferential: we will reverse such a\n\ndenial only if the district court \"mistook the law, clearly erred\n\nin its factual assessments, or otherwise abused its discretion in\n\ngranting\" the preliminary injunction.       McGuire v. Reilly, 260 F.3d\n\n36, 42 (1st Cir. 2001).        Of course, a material error of law\n\nconstitutes an abuse of discretion.       Review of the dismissal of a\n\nclaim under rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which\n\nrelief can be granted is de novo.          Martin v. Applied Cellular\n\nTech., Inc., 284 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2002).        In the end, both the\n\ndismissal of the claim and the denial of the preliminary injunction\n\nturn on pure issues of law.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f          The standard of review for a law that burdens ballot\n\naccess and voting rights is not static; rather, the Supreme Court\n\nhas suggested something of a sliding scale approach and has noted\n\nthat there is no \"bright line\" to separate unconstitutional state\n\nelection laws from constitutional ones.     Timmons v. Twin Cities\n\nArea New Party, 520 U.S. 351, 359 (1997).        We must \"weigh the\n\n'character and magnitude' of the burden the [s]tate's rule imposes\n\n[on rights to vote and run for office] against the interests the\n\nstate contends justifies that burden, and consider the extent to\n\nwhich the [s]tate's concerns make the burden necessary. . . .\n\nRegulations imposing severe burdens on plaintiffs' rights must be\n\nnarrowly tailored and advance a compelling state interest.   Lesser\n\nburdens, however, trigger less exacting review, and a [s]tate's\n\n'important regulatory interests' will usually be enough to justify\n\n'reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions.'\" Id. at 358 (quoting\n\nBurdick v. Takushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992)) (citations omitted).\n\n          McClure is correct that the state's interests here are\n\nweaker than the interests stated in Storer.   The burden imposed on\n\nMcClure's rights here is also not severe.   In the end, the state's\n\nimportant regulatory interests, while more fragmented than those in\n\nStorer, are sufficient to justify that burden.\n\n          McClure argues that the scheme forces him to make a\n\ndifficult choice between two crucial rights, voting and running for\n\noffice, because the scheme does not allow him, within a ninety-day\n\n                               -11-\n\fperiod, both to run for state senate as an independent and to vote\n\nin a party's presidential primary.         But voting in a presidential\n\nprimary has never been treated in the same way as voting in a\n\ngeneral election, and indeed, voting in the primary of a party to\n\nwhich one does not belong is not a constitutional right.          See Cal.\n\nDemocratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567, 573 n.5 (2000) (\"As for\n\nthe associational 'interest' in selecting the candidate of a group\n\nto   which   one   does   not   belong,   that   falls   far   short   of   a\n\nconstitutional right, if indeed it can even fairly be characterized\n\nas an interest.     It has been described in our cases as a 'desire'\n\n. . . .\").     It is instead an associational right of a political\n\nparty to decide whether it wants to include nonmembers in its own\n\nprimaries; this is a decision that the state generally must respect\n\nin its regulation of primaries.           See id. at 575; Tashjian v.\n\nRepublican Party of Conn., 479 U.S. 208, 214-16 (1986); Cool Moose\n\nParty v. Rhode Island, 183 F.3d 80, 85 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n             The Massachusetts scheme, of course, does not operate to\n\nexclude existing Democrats from voting in the presidential primary\n\nand then running for office as Democrats; it only prevents those\n\nwho are unenrolled or enrolled in a different party from both\n\nvoting in the Democratic presidential primary and then running for\n\noffice under their old party designation.        The choice that McClure\n\npoints to is only a choice between running for political office\n\n(which is surely an important political right) and voting in\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fanother organization's primary (which is not a constitutional right\n\nat all).   The state places no great burden on McClure when it asks\n\nhim to refrain from the latter in order to participate in the\n\nformer.\n\n           The remaining burden imposed on McClure by this statute\n\nis that it forces him to think ninety days ahead before the filing\n\ndeadline if he plans on becoming an unenrolled candidate, because\n\nhe needs to be careful that he does not vote in a disqualifying\n\nprimary within this time period.     But Storer held that a potential\n\ncandidate was not significantly burdened by a statute that forced\n\nhim to think ahead one full year before becoming an independent\n\ncandidate.   415 U.S. at 734, 736.\n\n           The significance of the burden on McClure is further\n\nreduced by the fact that it falls evenly on all political groups.\n\nThe Supreme Court has said that review of election regulations will\n\nbe far sharper if there is discrimination against certain distinct\n\npolitical groups. See, e.g., Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780,\n\n793-94 (1983).       McClure argues that the Massachusetts scheme\n\ndiscriminates against unenrolled voters, but this is not so.       The\n\nscheme applies evenhandedly to enrolled individuals of all parties\n\nas well as to unenrolled individuals.      All candidates are banned\n\nfrom running for office using one enrollment status if they have\n\nheld some other enrollment status for the ninety days before the\n\nprimary    filing   deadlines.    The   rule   thus   equally   burdens\n\n                                 -13-\n\fRepublicans, Democrats, and independents.    If anything, the laws\n\ngive unenrolled voters more rights than other voters by permitting\n\nthem to vote in any party's primary (at least if they are willing\n\nto change designations); individuals enrolled in a party cannot\n\nvote in a different party's primary unless they changed their\n\nenrollment more than twenty days before the primary.    Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 53, § 38.\n\n           McClure also argues that the election laws discriminate\n\nagainst individuals running for in-state as opposed to state-wide\n\nand federal offices, because the filing deadline for in-state\n\noffices is one week earlier than the filing deadlines for other\n\noffices.    Thus the presidential primaries occurred within the\n\nninety-day period for in-state offices but not for state-wide or\n\nfederal offices.     It is not rational to infer from this fact an\n\nintent on the part of a state to discriminate against potential in-\n\nstate officials as a group while favoring potential state-wide and\n\nfederal officials.     No evident reason for an inference of such\n\ndiscrimination exists.    At any rate, the defendants give entirely\n\nlegitimate reasons for the different deadlines.     Candidates for\n\nstate-wide and federal offices generally have higher signature\n\nrequirements to get on the ballot than candidates for in-state\n\noffices. See Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, § 6.   Also, administratively,\n\nit makes more sense for election officials to have two different\n\n\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fdeadlines as opposed to one, to avoid an excessive workload.                    We\n\nsee no invidious discrimination here.\n\n            Having   found   that    the    laws     place   little    burden   on\n\nMcClure, we weigh that burden against the state's regulatory\n\ninterests in utilizing its scheme.            The defendants point to the\n\nstate   interests    articulated     in    Storer,    which   were     considered\n\n\"compelling\" in the context of that case.             See Storer, 415 U.S. at\n\n736.    Those interests included preventing \"splintered parties\" and\n\n\"unrestrained factionalism\" and protecting \"the stability of [the\n\nstate's] political system.\"         Id.    As Storer explained, the statute\n\n\"protects the direct primary process by refusing to recognize\n\nindependent candidates who do not make early plans to leave a party\n\nand take the alternative course to the ballot.                It works against\n\nindependent candidacies prompted by short-range political goals,\n\npique, or personal quarrel.         It is also a substantial barrier to a\n\nparty fielding an 'independent' candidate to capture and bleed off\n\nvotes in the general election that might well go to another party.\"\n\nId. at 735.\n\n            McClure's   chief     argument      is    that    Storer    must    be\n\ndistinguished    because     of   the     state's    peculiar   scheme     as   to\n\nprimaries. McClure admits that the Massachusetts provision barring\n\ncandidates from running as independents if they have been enrolled\n\nas members of other parties within ninety days of the filing\n\ndeadline, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, § 6, is very similar to (and in\n\n                                     -15-\n\ffact much less stringent than) the provision at issue in Storer.\n\nHowever, he challenges the way he became enrolled, by voting in the\n\nMassachusetts   presidential    primary,   pursuant   to   Massachusetts\n\nGeneral Laws chapter 53, section 37.       He argues that people like\n\nhim, who were enrolled in a party only through voting in a\n\npresidential primary and who were enrolled for a very short period\n\nof time, cannot constitutionally be disqualified from being placed\n\non the ballot as independents because the state has no important\n\ninterest in disqualifying such people.\n\n          McClure asserts that many of the interests at play in\n\nStorer do not apply to his case because the enrollment requirements\n\nhere only apply to presidential primaries, and McClure is seeking\n\nto run in a state race.    Thus, the concern in Storer about sore\n\nloser candidates who run as independents in order to bring intra-\n\nparty disputes outside of the party is not present in his case.\n\nMcClure also argues that the fact that Massachusetts only forces\n\nunenrolled voters who vote in presidential primaries, and not other\n\nsorts of primaries, to affiliate with a party, and that even when\n\nsuch affiliation is forced, it need only be very brief because a\n\nvoter (like McClure) can immediately unenroll, shows that the state\n\ninterest in closing primaries to non-affiliates is weak.         McClure\n\nnotes that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has stated that\n\nthe   Massachusetts   primary    scheme    \"blur[s]    any    meaningful\n\ndistinction between open and closed primaries.\" Metros v. Sec'y of\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fthe Commonwealth, 484 N.E.2d 1015, 1021 n.9 (Mass. 1985)(quoting\n\nLangone v. Sec'y of the Commonwealth, 446 N.E.2d 43, 47 (Mass.\n\n1983)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n            This case is not precisely on all fours with Storer: the\n\nstate interests at play in the Massachusetts scheme are far weaker\n\nthan the state interests at play in the California scheme at issue\n\nin Storer.    Concerns about sore losers and short-term candidacies\n\nmotivated by intra-party quarrel are not particularly well served\n\nby this scheme.        Still, the scheme does help serve some other\n\nimportant    state     interests.      It     provides    some   assurance     that\n\nunenrolled     candidates       actually       are     independent     of     party\n\naffiliations.        Also, like the law upheld in Storer, it forces\n\npotential candidates for office to think ahead before the filing\n\ndeadline,     thus    weeding    out    frivolous       candidacies     and    only\n\npermitting serious candidates to go forward.\n\n             It is true that these state interests would be served\n\nmore strongly by a scheme which made all primaries truly closed\n\n(thus forcing all primary voters to have prior enrollment in the\n\nparty) and     which    disallowed     all    voters     in   such   truly    closed\n\nprimaries from running for office under another party's banner or\n\nas an unenrolled candidate.         The state's 1994 switch from a scheme\n\nthat required party affiliation from unenrolled voters for voting\n\nin all primaries to a scheme that required affiliation only for\n\nvoting in presidential primaries reflected a move towards the\n\n                                       -17-\n\fopening up of the primary system to independent voters.                       The\n\npurpose seems to have been to increase voter participation as a\n\nwhole in those electoral contests.             See 1993 Mass. Acts ch. 475\n\n(one key purpose of the emergency bill in which the 1994 amendments\n\nwere embedded was to \"increase electoral participation in the\n\ncommonwealth\").\n\n            But the state had an important reason for retaining the\n\nenrollment requirement for presidential primaries: it was trying to\n\nserve the will of the parties themselves.            The Democratic Party of\n\nthe United States has a charter provision stating that delegates to\n\nthe party's national convention must be chosen through processes\n\nwhich \"restrict participation to Democrats only.\"                The Charter &\n\nThe Bylaws of the Democratic Party of the United States, art. 2, §\n\n4(e).   No party has challenged the enrollment requirement for\n\npresidential party primaries since the 1994 amendment.                    States\n\ngenerally must respect the wishes of parties about who should be\n\nincluded in their own primaries, see Jones, 530 U.S. at 575;\n\nTashjian, 479 U.S. at 214-16; Cool Moose Party, 183 F.3d at 85, so\n\nclearly acceding to these wishes constitutes an important state\n\ninterest.\n\n            As   well,   the    state        could   easily    conclude       that\n\npresidential     primaries     were   different      from     other   types     of\n\nprimaries; these types of primaries could justifiably be thought of\n\nas much more susceptible to inundation from non-affiliated voters\n\n                                      -18-\n\fthan other primaries because their turnout tends to be so much\n\nhigher    and    the    interest      that   they   inspire    so   much   broader.\n\nFurther, there is less need to open these presidential primaries in\n\norder to encourage voter participation.\n\n              The state (again reflecting the interests of the two\n\npolitical parties) can thus have a strong interest in trying to\n\ncurb the impact of non-affiliated voters on a party presidential\n\nprimary.      See Jones, 530 U.S. at 581-82 (law forcing parties to\n\nopen primaries to all voters was unconstitutional because it\n\n\"adulterat[ed]\" their candidate selection process); Rosario v.\n\nRockefeller,      410    U.S.    752,    760-62     (1973)    (upholding      statute\n\ndesigned to prevent inter-party raiding in primaries).                        Forcing\n\npresidential primary voters to enroll in the party ameliorated this\n\npotential problem.           Disqualification from getting on the ballot as\n\nan independent is only a small piece of the disincentive scheme\n\nthat    is    operating.        For    example,     while    McClure    immediately\n\ndisaffiliated from the Democratic party, many voters do not; the\n\nenrollment thus has the effect of making it more difficult for\n\nvoters to vote in any primary involving another party during the\n\nnext election cycle.           Thus, even if the state chose, as it did in\n\n1994,    to     open    up    other   primaries,     its     interest    in    moving\n\nincrementally and not opening presidential primaries is a strong\n\none.     It is sufficient to survive the level of scrutiny we apply\n\nunder Timmons.\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\f          McClure's final argument is that there were various\n\nalternative ways in which the state could have tailored its scheme\n\nto achieve the same ends with less of an infringement on his\n\ninterests.     For example, the state could have pushed back the\n\nfiling deadline for in-state offices roughly a week, thus moving\n\nthe presidential primaries out of the ninety-day window.    But our\n\nreview here is far from strict scrutiny and we will not speculate\n\nas to all of the other conceivable ways in which the state could\n\nhave set up its framework.        It is enough that the existing\n\nframework serves the significant state interests noted above.\n\n          We hold that the state interests in this statutory\n\nframework outweigh the infringement on McClure's rights.    Because\n\nwe resolve the case on these grounds, we need not reach the state's\n\nargument that McClure's delay in prosecuting this appeal renders it\n\nimpracticable to fashion appropriate, non-disruptive relief.\n\n                                IV.\n\n             The district court's denial of a preliminary injunction\n\nand dismissal of the claim are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f",

The town clerk refused to issue the certification because McClure had voted in the Democratic party presidential primary on March 2, 2004. Pursuant to a state statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 37, such voting automatically enrolled McClure as a Democrat. Pursuant to another state statute, ch. 53, &#167; 6, one running for an in-state office as an independent must not be enrolled in a political party for the ninety days preceding the filing deadline for primaries for candidates running for state senate. As a result, McClure's temporary enrollment automatically disqualified him from running for the state senate as an independent because the deadline for filing an intent to run for that office was less than ninety days after the date of the Democratic primary in which he voted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, after an expedited hearing, denied McClure's motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed his claim on May 17, 2004. <i>McClure v.

Such a certification will not be granted \"to any such candidate who shall have been an enrolled member of any political party during the time prior to the last day for filing nomination papers as provided in section ten, and on or after the day by which a primary candidate is required by section forty-eight to establish enrollment in a political party.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 6. In turn, chapter 53, section 48 states that an enrolled candidate seeking to enter a party primary must have been a member of that party for the ninety days before the filing deadline for that primary, which is the \"last Tuesday in May\" for candidates for state senate. The beginning date of the nonenrollment period for independent candidates is thus ninety days prior to the last Tuesday in May. Next, chapter 53, section 10 establishes the \"last Tuesday in May\" as the deadline for filing candidacies for in-state offices for the general elections, and the last Tuesday in May thus acts as the ending date for the nonenrollment period. The effect of chapter 53, section 6 in 2004 was to require unenrolled candidates seeking a place on the ballot for state senate not to have been enrolled as a member of any political party between February 24, 2004, and May 25, 2004. This year, the state presidential primary was held within the ninety-day period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nonenrollment period for independent candidates for state-wide (e.g., governor) and federal (e.g., United States Senator) offices begins one week later, ninety days prior to the first Tuesday in June. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 48. The ninety-day period thus did not include the presidential primaries for individuals running for these offices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar scheme is in place for <i>enrolled</i> candidates. <i>See</i> Mass.

In fact, since section 6 incorporates section 48 by reference, the beginning date of the period within which candidates running for a given office under a party banner must have been a member of that party is the exact same date as the beginning date of the period within which unenrolled candidates must not have been enrolled as a member of any party. For state senate candidates, this key date is ninety days prior to the last Tuesday in May. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen.

Upon appearing to vote in a primary, a ballot clerk asks unenrolled voters in which primary they \"desire [] to vote\"; they may then vote in that primary. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 37.

Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 37. The change of status back to unenrolled is effective once the board receives the certificate. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 38.

Since the 1994 amendment, however, only the presidential primaries have had that effect; an unenrolled voter may vote in all other primaries without losing her unenrolled status.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Voters currently enrolled in one party in Massachusetts may not generally vote in any other party's primary, and they may not switch their enrollment to another party within twenty days of a primary.

On March 2, 2004, McClure went to the polls to vote in the Democratic party's presidential primary in Massachusetts. In his affidavit, he states that on that date, the ballot clerk asked him in which party's presidential primary he would like to vote and when he asked for a Democratic party ballot, the clerk put a large \"D\" next to his name. McClure then told the ballot clerk that he did not want to enroll in the Democratic party; the clerk told him that he would not be enrolled in the Democratic party and handed him a \"certificate\" indicating that he was \"establishing [his] voter status as `unenrolled.'\" After voting, a different clerk (an \"exit clerk\") took this certificate from McClure. Elizabeth Delaney, the town clerk of the Town of Chelmsford, stated, in her affidavit, that the effect of this certificate was merely to immediately change McClure's enrollment status back to \"unenrolled.\" However, he was briefly enrolled as a Democrat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 25, 2004, McClure, having satisfied the other requirements to be an unenrolled candidate for state senate whose name appears on the ballot, applied to the Chelmsford town clerk for a voter registration certificate. The town clerk had called him the previous day (March 24) and told him over the phone that she would not be able to grant such a certificate because McClure voted in the Democratic presidential primary on March 2, 2004, which enrolled him as a Democrat within ninety days of the May 25 deadline for filing. In this conversation, McClure informed her of the misinformation he received from the ballot clerk. The town clerk responded that the election laws are very complex, one cannot expect a checker at the polls to understand all of their details, and McClure should have called her as chief election official if he had any questions or doubts. On March 26, 2004, the town clerk formally and in writing denied McClure's certificate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McClure filed suit in federal district court in Massachusetts on April 26, 2004, alleging that the ninety-day enrollment restriction effectuated by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 53, sections 6 and 37 violated his First Amendment speech and association rights as a voter and as a candidate for public office. He also asserted that it violated his Equal Protection Clause rights because it constituted invidious discrimination against unenrolled voters. He finally alleged both that the statutory scheme itself gave unconstitutionally inadequate notice to McClure and that the negligence of various town and state officials led to a similar lack of notice. McClure sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the time constraints involved, the district court granted McClure's motion for an expedited hearing on his motion for a preliminary injunction, and then denied the preliminary injunction and dismissed the claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <i>McClure,</i> 2004 WL 1092325, at *1, *4. The district court, relying on the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Storer v. Brown,</i> 415 U.S. 724, 94 S.Ct. 1274, 39 L.Ed.2d 714 (1974), held that McClure could not state a claim on the merits. <i>McClure,</i> 2004 WL 1092325, at *2-*3. <i>Storer</i> upheld a California law preventing candidates from having their names placed on the ballot in a general election as independents if they had registered with a political party at any time within one year prior to the date of the primary election that preceded that general election. <i>Storer,</i> 415 U.S. at 728, 94 S.Ct. 1274. The district court held that the scheme at issue in <i>Storer</i> was identical in its relevant respects to the one at issue here, thus foreclosing the bulk of McClure's claim. <i>McClure,</i> 2004 WL 1092325, at *2-*3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also held that McClure's attempt to distinguish <i>Storer</i> failed; the fact that the scheme at issue here only applied to presidential primaries and not to all primaries is a \"distinction ... without a meaningful difference\" because \"[i]t is impossible to see how a statute that places an even lesser burden on an independent voter who desires to seek public office could be more violative of a voter's rights.\" <i>Id.</i> at *3.

Review of the dismissal of a claim under rule 12(b)(6) for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted is <i>de novo. Martin v. Applied Cellular Tech., Inc.,</i> 284 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2002). In the end, both the dismissal of the claim and the denial of the preliminary injunction turn on pure issues of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of review for a law that burdens ballot access and voting rights is not static; rather, the Supreme Court has suggested something of a sliding scale approach and has noted that there is no \"bright line\" to separate unconstitutional state election laws from constitutional ones. <i>Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party,</i> 520 U.S. 351, 359, 117 S.Ct. 1364, 137 L.Ed.2d 589 (1997). We must \"weigh the `character and magnitude' of the burden the [s]tate's rule imposes [on rights to vote and run for office] against the interests the state contends justifies that burden, and consider the extent to which the [s]tate's concerns make the burden necessary.... Regulations imposing severe burdens on plaintiffs' rights must be narrowly tailored and advance a compelling state interest. Lesser burdens, however, trigger less exacting review, and a[s]tate's `important regulatory interests' will usually be enough to justify `reasonable, nondiscriminatory restrictions.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 358, 117 S.Ct. 1364 (quoting <i>Burdick v. Takushi,</i> 504 U.S. 428, 434, 112 S.Ct. 2059, 119 L.Ed.2d 245 (1992)) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McClure is correct that the state's interests here are weaker than the interests stated in <i>Storer.</i> The burden imposed on McClure's rights here is also not severe. In the end, the state's important regulatory interests, while more fragmented than those in <i>Storer,</i> are sufficient to justify that burden.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McClure argues that the scheme forces him to make a difficult choice between two crucial rights, voting and running for office, because the scheme does not allow him, within a ninety-day period, both to run for state senate as an independent and to vote in a party's presidential primary. But voting in a presidential primary has never been treated in the same way as voting in a general election, and indeed, voting in the primary of a party to which one does not belong is not a constitutional right. <i>See Cal. Democratic Party v. Jones,</i> 530 U.S. 567, 573 n. 5, 120 S.Ct. 2402, 147 L.Ed.2d 502 (2000) (\"As for the associational `interest' in selecting the candidate of a group to which one does not belong, that falls far short of a constitutional right, if indeed it can even fairly be characterized as an interest. It has been described in our cases as a `desire'....\"). It is instead an associational right <i>of a political party</i> to decide whether it wants to include nonmembers in its own primaries; this is a decision that the state generally must respect in its regulation of primaries. <i>See id.</i> at 575, 120 S.Ct. 2402; <i>Tashjian v. Republican Party of Conn.,</i> 479 U.S. 208, 214-16, 107 S.Ct. 544, 93 L.Ed.2d 514 (1986); <i>Cool Moose Party v. Rhode Island,</i> 183 F.3d 80, 85 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Massachusetts scheme, of course, does not operate to exclude existing Democrats from voting in the presidential primary and then running for office as Democrats; it only prevents those who are unenrolled or enrolled in a different party from both voting in the Democratic presidential primary and then running for office under their old party designation. The choice that McClure points to is only a choice between running for political office (which is surely an important political right) and voting in another organization's primary (which is not a constitutional right at all). The state places no great burden on McClure when it asks him to refrain from the latter in order to participate in the former.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining burden imposed on McClure by this statute is that it forces him to think ninety days ahead before the filing deadline if he plans on becoming an unenrolled candidate, because he needs to be careful that he does not vote in a disqualifying primary within this time period. But <i>Storer</i> held that a potential candidate was not significantly burdened by a statute that forced him to think ahead one full year before becoming an independent candidate. 415 U.S. at 734, 736, 94 S.Ct. 1274.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The significance of the burden on McClure is further reduced by the fact that it falls evenly on all political groups. The Supreme Court has said that review of election regulations will be far sharper if there is discrimination against certain distinct political groups. <i>See, e.g., Anderson v. Celebrezze,</i> 460 U.S. 780, 793-94, 103 S.Ct. 1564, 75 L.Ed.2d 547 (1983). McClure argues that the Massachusetts scheme discriminates against unenrolled voters, but this is not so. The scheme applies evenhandedly to enrolled individuals of all parties as well as to unenrolled individuals. All candidates are banned from running for office using one enrollment status if they have held some other enrollment status for the ninety days before the primary filing deadlines. The rule thus equally burdens Republicans, Democrats, and independents. If anything, the laws give unenrolled voters more rights than other voters by permitting them to vote in any party's primary (at least if they are willing to change designations); individuals enrolled in a party cannot vote in a different party's primary unless they changed their enrollment more than twenty days before the primary. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McClure also argues that the election laws discriminate against individuals running for in-state as opposed to state-wide and federal offices, because the filing deadline for in-state offices is one week earlier than the filing deadlines for other offices. Thus the presidential primaries occurred within the ninety-day period for in-state offices but not for state-wide or federal offices. It is not rational to infer from this fact an intent on the part of a state to discriminate against potential in-state officials as a group while favoring potential state-wide and federal officials. No evident reason for an inference of such discrimination exists. At any rate, the defendants give entirely legitimate reasons for the different deadlines. Candidates for state-wide and federal offices generally have higher signature requirements to get on the ballot than candidates for in-state offices. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 6. Also, administratively, it makes more sense for election officials to have two different deadlines as opposed to one, to avoid an excessive workload. We see no invidious discrimination here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found that the laws place little burden on McClure, we weigh that burden against the state's regulatory interests in utilizing its scheme. The defendants point to the state interests articulated in <i>Storer,</i> which were considered \"compelling\" in the context of that case. <i>See Storer,</i> 415 U.S. at 736, 94 S.Ct. 1274. Those interests included preventing \"splintered parties\" and \"unrestrained factionalism\" and protecting \"the stability of [the state's] political system.\" <i>Id.</i> As <i>Storer</i> explained, the statute \"protects the direct primary process by refusing to recognize independent candidates who do not make early plans to leave a party and take the alternative course to the ballot. It works against independent candidacies prompted by short-range political goals, pique, or personal quarrel. It is also a substantial barrier to a party fielding an `independent' candidate to capture and bleed off votes in the general election that might well go to another party.\" <i>Id.</i> at 735, 94 S.Ct. 1274.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McClure's chief argument is that <i>Storer</i> must be distinguished because of the state's peculiar scheme as to primaries. McClure admits that the Massachusetts provision barring candidates from running as independents if they have been enrolled as members of other parties within ninety days of the filing deadline, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 6, is very similar to (and in fact much less stringent than) the provision at issue in <i>Storer.</i> However, he challenges the <i>way</i> he became enrolled, by voting in the Massachusetts presidential primary, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 53, section 37. He argues that people like him, who were enrolled in a party only through voting in a presidential primary and who were enrolled for a very short period of time, cannot constitutionally be disqualified from being placed on the ballot as independents because the state has no important interest in disqualifying such people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McClure asserts that many of the interests at play in <i>Storer</i> do not apply to his case because the enrollment requirements here only apply to presidential primaries, and McClure is seeking to run in a state race. Thus, the concern in <i>Storer</i> about sore loser candidates who run as independents in order to bring intra-party disputes outside of the party is not present in his case. McClure also argues that the fact that Massachusetts only forces unenrolled voters who vote in presidential primaries, and not other sorts of primaries, to affiliate with a party, and that even when such affiliation is forced, it need only be very brief because a voter (like McClure) can immediately unenroll, shows that the state interest in closing primaries to non-affiliates is weak. McClure notes that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has stated that the Massachusetts primary scheme \"blur[s] any meaningful distinction between open and closed primaries.\" <i>Metros v. Sec'y of the Commonwealth,</i> 396 Mass. 156, 484 N.E.2d 1015, 1021 n. 9 (1985)(quoting <i>Langone v. Sec'y of the Commonwealth,</i> 388 Mass. 185, 446 N.E.2d 43, 47 (1983)) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is not precisely on all fours with <i>Storer:</i> the state interests at play in the Massachusetts scheme are far weaker than the state interests at play in the California scheme at issue in <i>Storer.</i> Concerns about sore losers and short-term candidacies motivated by intra-party quarrel are not particularly well served by this scheme. Still, the scheme does help serve some other important state interests. It provides some assurance that unenrolled candidates actually are independent of party affiliations. Also, like the law upheld in <i>Storer,</i> it forces potential candidates for office to think ahead before the filing deadline, thus weeding out frivolous candidacies and only permitting serious candidates to go forward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that these state interests would be served more strongly by a scheme which made all primaries truly closed (thus forcing all primary voters to have prior enrollment in the party) and which disallowed all voters in such truly closed primaries from running for office under another party's banner or as an unenrolled candidate. The state's 1994 switch from a scheme that required party affiliation from unenrolled voters for voting in all primaries to a scheme that required affiliation only for voting in presidential primaries reflected a move towards the opening up of the primary system to independent voters. The purpose seems to have been to increase voter participation as a whole in those electoral contests. <i>See</i> 1993 Mass. Acts ch. 475 (one key purpose of the emergency bill in which the 1994 amendments were embedded was to \"increase electoral participation in the commonwealth\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the state had an important reason for retaining the enrollment requirement for presidential primaries: it was trying to serve the will of the parties themselves. The Democratic Party of the United States has a charter provision stating that delegates to the party's national convention must be chosen through processes which \"restrict participation to Democrats only.\" The Charter &amp; The Bylaws of the Democratic Party of the United States, art. 2, &#167; 4(e). No party has challenged the enrollment requirement for presidential party primaries since the 1994 amendment. States generally must respect the wishes of parties about who should be included in their own primaries, <i>see Jones,</i> 530 U.S. at 575, 120 S.Ct. 2402; <i>Tashjian,</i> 479 U.S. at 214-16, 107 S.Ct. 544; <i>Cool Moose Party,</i> 183 F.3d at 85, so clearly acceding to these wishes constitutes an important state interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As well, the state could easily conclude that presidential primaries were different from other types of primaries; these types of primaries could justifiably be thought of as much more susceptible to inundation from non-affiliated voters than other primaries because their turnout tends to be so much higher and the interest that they inspire so much broader. Further, there is less need to open these presidential primaries in order to encourage voter participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state (again reflecting the interests of the two political parties) can thus have a strong interest in trying to curb the impact of non-affiliated voters on a party presidential primary. <i>See Jones,</i> 530 U.S. at 581-82, 120 S.Ct. 2402 (law forcing parties to open primaries to all voters was unconstitutional because it \"adulterat[ed]\" their candidate selection process); <i>Rosario v. Rockefeller,</i> 410 U.S. 752, 760-62, 93 S.Ct. 1245, 36 L.Ed.2d 1 (1973) (upholding statute designed to prevent inter-party raiding in primaries). Forcing presidential primary voters to enroll in the party ameliorated this potential problem. Disqualification from getting on the ballot as an independent is only a small piece of the disincentive scheme that is operating. For example, while McClure immediately disaffiliated from the Democratic party, many voters do not; the enrollment thus has the effect of making it more difficult for voters to vote in any primary involving another party during the next election cycle. Thus, even if the state chose, as it did in 1994, to open up other primaries, its interest in moving incrementally and not opening presidential primaries is a strong one. It is sufficient to survive the level of scrutiny we apply under <i>Timmons.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McClure's final argument is that there were various alternative ways in which the state could have tailored its scheme to achieve the same ends with less of an infringement on his interests. For example, the state could have pushed back the filing deadline for in-state offices roughly a week, thus moving the presidential primaries out of the ninety-day window. But our review here is far from strict scrutiny and we will not speculate as to all of the other conceivable ways in which the state could have set up its framework. It is enough that the existing framework serves the significant state interests noted above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the state interests in this statutory framework outweigh the infringement on McClure's rights. Because we resolve the case on these grounds, we need not reach the state's argument that McClure's delay in prosecuting this appeal renders it impracticable to fashion appropriate, non-disruptive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's denial of a preliminary injunction and dismissal of the claim are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> McClure's wife, Martha McClure, was also named as a plaintiff in the suit and submitted an affidavit.

He sought injunctive and declaratory relief, requiring that he be placed on the ballot as an independent candidate in the race for a state senate seat.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March of 2004, McClure had sought certification from a town clerk to be placed on the ballot as an unenrolled candidate for state senate in Massachusetts. \"Unenrolled\" means not affiliated with any political party. The town clerk refused to issue the certification because McClure had voted in the Democratic party presidential primary on March 2, 2004. Pursuant to a state statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 37, such voting automatically enrolled McClure as a Democrat. Pursuant to another state statute, ch. 53, &#167; 6, one running for an in-state office as an independent must not be enrolled in a political party for the ninety days preceding the filing deadline for primaries for candidates running for state senate. As a result, McClure's temporary enrollment automatically disqualified him from running for the state senate as an independent because the deadline for filing an intent to run for that office was less than ninety days after the date of the Democratic primary in which he voted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, after an expedited hearing, denied McClure's motion for a preliminary injunction and dismissed his claim on May 17, 2004. <i>McClure v.

Such a certification will not be granted \"to any such candidate who shall have been an enrolled member of any political party during the time prior to the last day for filing nomination papers as provided in section ten, and on or after the day by which a primary candidate is required by section forty-eight to establish enrollment in a political party.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 6. In turn, chapter 53, section 48 states that an enrolled candidate seeking to enter a party primary must have been a member of that party for the ninety days before the filing deadline for that primary, which is the \"last Tuesday in May\" for candidates for state senate. The beginning date of the nonenrollment period for independent candidates is thus ninety days prior to the last Tuesday in May. Next, chapter 53, section 10 establishes the \"last Tuesday in May\" as the deadline for filing candidacies for in-state offices for the general elections, and the last Tuesday in May thus acts as the ending date for the nonenrollment period. The effect of chapter 53, section 6 in 2004 was to require unenrolled candidates seeking a place on the ballot for state senate not to have been enrolled as a member of any political party between February 24, 2004, and May 25, 2004. This year, the state presidential primary was held within the ninety-day period.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nonenrollment period for independent candidates for state-wide (e.g., governor) and federal (e.g., United States Senator) offices begins one week later, ninety days prior to the first Tuesday in June. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 48. The ninety-day period thus did not include the presidential primaries for individuals running for these offices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A similar scheme is in place for <i>enrolled</i> candidates. <i>See</i> Mass.

In fact, since section 6 incorporates section 48 by reference, the beginning date of the period within which candidates running for a given office under a party banner must have been a member of that party is the exact same date as the beginning date of the period within which unenrolled candidates must not have been enrolled as a member of any party. For state senate candidates, this key date is ninety days prior to the last Tuesday in May. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen.

Upon appearing to vote in a primary, a ballot clerk asks unenrolled voters in which primary they \"desire [] to vote\"; they may then vote in that primary. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 37. Generally, an unenrolled voter can vote in party primaries without losing her unenrolled status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is an exception, however, for presidential primaries; in a presidential primary, upon voting, \"the voter shall become enrolled in and shall remain a member of the political party whose ballot he received until he files a certificate, signed under the pains and penalties of perjury, with the board of registrars of voters, requesting to have his enrollment changed to another party or political designation or cancelled....\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 37. The change of status back to unenrolled is effective once the board receives the certificate. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 38.

In his affidavit, he states that on that date, the ballot clerk asked him in which party's presidential primary he would like to vote and when he asked for a Democratic party ballot, the clerk put a large \"D\" next to his name. McClure then told the ballot clerk that he did not want to enroll in the Democratic party; the clerk told him that he would not be enrolled in the Democratic party and handed him a \"certificate\" indicating that he was \"establishing [his] voter status as `unenrolled.'\" After voting, a different clerk (an \"exit clerk\") took this certificate from McClure. Elizabeth Delaney, the town clerk of the Town of Chelmsford, stated, in her affidavit, that the effect of this certificate was merely to immediately change McClure's enrollment status back to \"unenrolled.\" However, he was briefly enrolled as a Democrat.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 25, 2004, McClure, having satisfied the other requirements to be an unenrolled candidate for state senate whose name appears on the ballot, applied to the Chelmsford town clerk for a voter registration certificate. The town clerk had called him the previous day (March 24) and told him over the phone that she would not be able to grant such a certificate because McClure voted in the Democratic presidential primary on March 2, 2004, which enrolled him as a Democrat within ninety days of the May 25 deadline for filing. In this conversation, McClure informed her of the misinformation he received from the ballot clerk. The town clerk responded that the election laws are very complex, one cannot expect a checker at the polls to understand all of their details, and McClure should have called her as chief election official if he had any questions or doubts. On March 26, 2004, the town clerk formally and in writing denied McClure's certificate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McClure filed suit in federal district court in Massachusetts on April 26, 2004, alleging that the ninety-day enrollment restriction effectuated by Massachusetts General Laws chapter 53, sections 6 and 37 violated his First Amendment speech and association rights as a voter and as a candidate for public office. He also asserted that it violated his Equal Protection Clause rights because it constituted invidious discrimination against unenrolled voters. He finally alleged both that the statutory scheme itself gave unconstitutionally inadequate notice to McClure and that the negligence of various town and state officials led to a similar lack of notice. McClure sought declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the time constraints involved, the district court granted McClure's motion for an expedited hearing on his motion for a preliminary injunction, and then denied the preliminary injunction and dismissed the claim under Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6). <i>McClure,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2004</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1092325</span></span>, at *1, *4.

But voting in a presidential primary has never been treated in the same way as voting in a general election, and indeed, voting in the primary of a party to which one does not belong is not a constitutional right. <i>See Cal.

The choice that McClure points to is only a choice between running for political office (which is surely an important political right) and voting in another organization's primary (which is not a constitutional right at all). The state places no great burden on McClure when it asks him to refrain from the latter in order to participate in the former.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining burden imposed on McClure by this statute is that it forces him to think ninety days ahead before the filing deadline if he plans on becoming an unenrolled candidate, because he needs to be careful that he does not vote in a disqualifying primary within this time period. But <i>Storer</i> held that a potential candidate was not significantly burdened by a statute that forced him to think ahead one full year before becoming an independent candidate. 415 U.S. at 734, 736, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108993\"><a href=\"/opinion/108993/storer-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Supreme Court has said that review of election regulations will be far sharper if there is discrimination against certain distinct political groups. <i>See, e.g., Anderson v. Celebrezze,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110904\"><a href=\"/opinion/110904/anderson-v-celebrezze/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span>, 793-94, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110904\"><a href=\"/opinion/110904/anderson-v-celebrezze/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">547</span></a></span> (1983). McClure argues that the Massachusetts scheme discriminates against unenrolled voters, but this is not so. The scheme applies evenhandedly to enrolled individuals of all parties as well as to unenrolled individuals. All candidates are banned from running for office using one enrollment status if they have held some other enrollment status for the ninety days before the primary filing deadlines. The rule thus equally burdens Republicans, Democrats, and independents. If anything, the laws give unenrolled voters more rights than other voters by permitting them to vote in any party's primary (at least if they are willing to change designations); individuals enrolled in a party cannot vote in a different party's primary unless they changed their enrollment more than twenty days before the primary. Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 38.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McClure also argues that the election laws discriminate against individuals running for in-state as opposed to state-wide and federal offices, because the filing deadline for in-state offices is one week earlier than the filing deadlines for other offices. Thus the presidential primaries occurred within the ninety-day period for in-state offices but not for state-wide or federal offices. It is not rational to infer from this fact an intent on the part of a state to discriminate against potential in-state officials as a group while favoring potential state-wide and federal officials. No evident reason for an inference of such discrimination exists. At any rate, the defendants give entirely legitimate reasons for the different deadlines. Candidates for state-wide and federal offices generally have higher signature requirements to get on the ballot than candidates for in-state offices. <i>See</i> Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 6. Also, administratively, it makes more sense for election officials to have two different deadlines as opposed to one, to avoid an excessive workload. We see no invidious discrimination here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found that the laws place little burden on McClure, we weigh that burden against the state's regulatory interests in utilizing its scheme. The defendants point to the state interests articulated in <i>Storer,</i> which were considered \"compelling\" in the context of that case. <i>See Storer,</i> 415 U.S. at 736, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108993\"><a href=\"/opinion/108993/storer-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1274</span></a></span>. Those interests included preventing \"splintered parties\" and \"unrestrained factionalism\" and protecting \"the stability of [the state's] political system.\" <i>Id.</i> As <i>Storer</i> explained, the statute \"protects the direct primary process by refusing to recognize independent candidates who do not make early plans to leave a party and take the alternative course to the ballot. It works against independent candidacies prompted by short-range political goals, pique, or personal quarrel. It is also a substantial barrier to a party fielding an `independent' candidate to capture and bleed off votes in the general election that might well go to another party.\" <i>Id.</i> at 735, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108993\"><a href=\"/opinion/108993/storer-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

McClure admits that the Massachusetts provision barring candidates from running as independents if they have been enrolled as members of other parties within ninety days of the filing deadline, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 53, &#167; 6, is very similar to (and in fact much less stringent than) the provision at issue in <i>Storer.</i> However, he challenges the <i>way</i> he became enrolled, by voting in the Massachusetts presidential primary, pursuant to Massachusetts General Laws chapter 53, section 37. He argues that people like him, who were enrolled in a party only through voting in a presidential primary and who were enrolled for a very short period of time, cannot constitutionally be disqualified from being placed on the ballot as independents because the state has no important interest in disqualifying such people.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McClure asserts that many of the interests at play in <i>Storer</i> do not apply to his case because the enrollment requirements here only apply to presidential primaries, and McClure is seeking to run in a state race. Thus, the concern in <i>Storer</i> about sore loser candidates who run as independents in order to bring intra-party disputes outside of the party is not present in his case. McClure also argues that the fact that Massachusetts only forces unenrolled voters who vote in presidential primaries, and not other sorts of primaries, to affiliate with a party, and that even when such affiliation is forced, it need only be very brief because a voter (like McClure) can immediately unenroll, shows that the state interest in closing primaries to non-affiliates is weak. McClure notes that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court has stated that the Massachusetts primary scheme \"blur[s] any meaningful distinction between open and closed primaries.\" <i>Metros v.

Still, the scheme does help serve some other important state interests. It provides some assurance that unenrolled candidates actually are independent of party affiliations. Also, like the law upheld in <i>Storer,</i> it forces potential candidates for office to think ahead before the filing deadline, thus weeding out frivolous candidacies and only permitting serious candidates to go forward.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that these state interests would be served more strongly by a scheme which made all primaries truly closed (thus forcing all primary voters to have prior enrollment in the party) and which disallowed all voters in such truly closed primaries from running for office under another party's banner or as an unenrolled candidate. The state's 1994 switch from a scheme that required party affiliation from unenrolled voters for voting in all primaries to a scheme that required affiliation only for voting in presidential primaries reflected a move towards the opening up of the primary system to independent voters. The purpose seems to have been to increase voter participation as a whole in those electoral contests. <i>See</i> 1993 Mass. Acts ch. 475 (one key purpose of the emergency bill in which the 1994 amendments were embedded was to \"increase electoral participation in the commonwealth\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the state had an important reason for retaining the enrollment requirement for presidential primaries: it was trying to serve the will of the parties themselves. The Democratic Party of the United States has a charter provision stating that delegates to the party's national convention must be chosen through processes which \"restrict participation to Democrats only.\" The Charter &amp; The Bylaws of the Democratic Party of the United States, art. 2, &#167; 4(e). No party has challenged the enrollment requirement for presidential party primaries since the 1994 amendment. States generally must respect the wishes of parties about who should be included in their own primaries, <i>see Jones,</i> 530 U.S. at 575, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118382\"><a href=\"/opinion/118382/california-democratic-party-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Further, there is less need to open these presidential primaries in order to encourage voter participation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The state (again reflecting the interests of the two political parties) can thus have a strong interest in trying to curb the impact of non-affiliated voters on a party presidential primary. <i>See Jones,</i> 530 U.S. at 581-82, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118382\"><a href=\"/opinion/118382/california-democratic-party-v-jones/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Forcing presidential primary voters to enroll in the party ameliorated this potential problem. Disqualification from getting on the ballot as an independent is only a small piece of the disincentive scheme that is operating. For example, while McClure immediately disaffiliated from the Democratic party, many voters do not; the enrollment thus has the effect of making it more difficult for voters to vote in any primary involving another party during the next election cycle. Thus, even if the state chose, as it did in 1994, to open up other primaries, its interest in moving incrementally and not opening presidential primaries is a strong one. It is sufficient to survive the level of scrutiny we apply under <i>Timmons.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McClure's final argument is that there were various alternative ways in which the state could have tailored its scheme to achieve the same ends with less of an infringement on his interests. For example, the state could have pushed back the filing deadline for in-state offices roughly a week, thus moving the presidential primaries out of the ninety-day window. But our review here is far from strict scrutiny and we will not speculate as to all of the other conceivable ways in which the state could have set up its framework. It is enough that the existing framework serves the significant state interests noted above.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the state interests in this statutory framework outweigh the infringement on McClure's rights. Because we resolve the case on these grounds, we need not reach the state's argument that McClure's delay in prosecuting this appeal renders it impracticable to fashion appropriate, non-disruptive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's denial of a preliminary injunction and dismissal of the claim are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> McClure's wife, Martha McClure, was also named as a plaintiff in the suit and submitted an affidavit. She alleges that she was, by virtue of her husband's exclusion, prohibited from voting for the candidate whose political beliefs are most in line with her own, and she claimed to be suing on behalf of all other voters similarly situated.
