KORTRIGHT,\n\n                       Plaintiffs, Appellees,\n\n                                 v.\n\n                          EDGARDO ARLEQUÍN,\n\n                     MUNICIPALITY OF GUAYANILLA,\n\n                       Defendants, Appellants.\n\n\n            APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n            [Hon. Salvador Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n            Torruella, Tashima,* and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Jorge Martínez-Luciano, with whom Johanna M. Emmanuelli\nHuertas and Emil Rodríguez-Escudero were on brief, for appellants.\n     Pedro R. Vázquez III, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                           October 1, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.           We consider for the second time\n\nthis political discrimination case, in which plaintiffs claim they\n\nwere   denied    payment   for   services    performed   on   behalf   of   the\n\nmunicipality of Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, in violation of the First\n\nAmendment. In the original appeal, we vacated the district court's\n\ndismissal of the case for failure to state a claim, holding that\n\nthe plaintiffs' complaint adequately pleaded the necessary elements\n\nof a political discrimination action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nRamírez v. Arlequín, 447 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir. 2006).              Subsequent\n\nto our decision, the district court reinstated the claims and\n\neventually entered a default judgment against defendants, the\n\nmunicipality of Guayanilla, Puerto Rico (\"the Municipality\"), and\n\nits mayor, Edgardo Arlequín, as a result of repeated discovery\n\nviolations.\n\n           In this appeal, defendants argue that: 1) the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in entering the default judgment, and\n\n2) even in light of the default judgment, the plaintiffs cannot\n\nprevail because their complaint does not make out a prima facie\n\ncase of political discrimination. For reasons we shall explain, we\n\nconclude that there was no abuse of discretion in the entry of a\n\ndefault judgment, and that the law of the case doctrine bars\n\ndefendants'      attempt   to    reargue    the   adequacy    of   plaintiffs'\n\ncomplaint.      We therefore affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f                                                 I.\n\nA.   Background\n\n             Although the background facts of this complaint are\n\ndescribed in our earlier decision in this case, id. at 20-22, we\n\nwill recount them here succinctly.                      Plaintiff Remexcel Managerial\n\nConsultants (\"Remexcel\") is a company owned by Reinaldo Ramírez.\n\nRemexcel     entered          into   a    contract       with   the   former     mayor    of\n\nGuayanilla, Ceferino Pacheco Guidicelli (\"Mayor Pacheco\"), a member\n\nof   the    New       Progressive        Party    (\"NPP\"),      to   perform   accounting\n\nservices for the Municipality that would identify residents who\n\nowed taxes.       Id. at 20-21.           Remexcel was to receive ten percent of\n\nthe money obtained as a result of its services.                           When Remexcel\n\nidentified        a     tax    deficiency         of    $4,444,058.87     owed    to     the\n\nMunicipality by Stinnes Interoil, an oil supply company, the\n\nMunicipality informed Stinnes of that determination, and Stinnes\n\nfiled a lawsuit against the Municipality in Puerto Rico Superior\n\nCourt seeking to dispute any outstanding tax liability.                          See Veba\n\nOil Supply v. Municipality of Guyanilla, Civ. No. JCO 96-003\n\n(Super. Ct. Ponce).\n\n             Plaintiff María S. Kortright is a lawyer who was hired by\n\nMayor Pacheco and the Municipality to defend that lawsuit under a\n\ncontingency arrangement which, like the agreement with Remexcel,\n\nwould pay her ten percent of the money collected as a result of her\n\nwork.      Ramírez, 447 F.3d at 21.                   Working on the case until 2000,\n\n\n\n                                                 -3-\n\fKortright   filed    the    summary   judgment    motions      which    led    to   a\n\nfavorable resolution of the case for the Municipality.                 Id.    After\n\nshe   performed    this    work,   however,   defendant       Edgardo    Arlequín\n\n(\"Mayor Arlequín\") took office, replacing Mayor Pacheco.                      Mayor\n\nArlequín is a member of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\").                   Id.\n\n            The complaint alleges that after taking office, Mayor\n\nArlequín began \"a pattern and practice of discrimination by taking\n\nadverse   action    against    anyone   associated      with    the    prior    New\n\nProgressive Party administration at any level,\" and, as a result,\n\nrefused to continue the Municipality's professional association\n\nwith the plaintiffs.        Kortright was replaced as counsel for the\n\nVeba Oil case.     According to the complaint, \"[t]he new counsel did\n\nnothing of record but enter his appearance before the court granted\n\nsummary   judgment    for    the   Municipality    in   the    amount    of    $4.5\n\nmillion, based on Kortright's work.\"             Id.    The new lawyer then\n\nsettled the suit for $1.8 million to be paid to the Municipality.\n\nId.\n\n            The plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,\n\nalleging, inter alia, that their First Amendment associational\n\nrights were violated because Mayor Arlequín and the Municipality\n\nrefused to pay them money they were rightfully owed solely because\n\nof their association with Mayor Pacheco.           Defendants moved in the\n\ndistrict court to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim.\n\nThe district court granted the motion, concluding that, pursuant to\n\nthe Supreme Court's decisions in Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347\n\n                                      -4-\n\f(1976), and Branti v. Finkel, 445 U.S. 507 (1980), plaintiffs' jobs\n\nwere not entitled to protection from political discrimination\n\nbecause they involved policymaking positions. Ramírez, 447 F.3d at\n\n21-22.1\n\n               In the appeal brought by plaintiffs, we were \"called upon\n\nto decide whether a deliberate executive decision by a state actor,\n\nbased only on a partisan political change of administration, to\n\ndeprive independent contractors of a payment to which they are\n\nlegally       entitled,       violates     the    contractors'        First    Amendment\n\nrights.\"       Id. at 20.         Ruling favorably for the plaintiffs, we\n\nconcluded       that      the     Elrod/Branti          doctrine's      exemption        of\n\npolicymakers        from      protection         against    political         affiliation\n\ndiscrimination         does     not   apply      \"to   someone    who   is     neither    a\n\ngovernment employee nor seeks a continuing relationship with the\n\ngovernment, but who merely asks to be paid in accordance with a\n\ncontract which that person has already performed.\"                      Id. at 23.       We\n\nwrote       that,   \"[a]lthough       we   must        always    be   concerned     about\n\nconstitutionalizing           traditional        common    law   claims,      we   see   no\n\ntheoretical bar to the First Amendment claim that is alleged here.\"\n\nId.   We went on to say that \"Remexcel and Kortright must plead that\n\nthey engaged in protected association, that they were entitled to\n\npayment under their contracts, and that the Municipality denied the\n\n\n        1\n       The district court also determined that, unlike his company\nRemexcel, plaintiff Ramírez lacked standing to bring suit. We\naccepted the dismissal of Ramírez's claims because he did not\ncontest that ruling. Id. at 22.\n\n                                            -5-\n\fpayment in retaliation for their exercise of associational rights.\n\nThese elements are adequately pleaded in the complaint.\" Id. at 25\n\n(citation   omitted).    Hence    we   reversed   the    district   court's\n\ndismissal of Remexcel's and Kortright's First Amendment retaliation\n\nclaims.\n\nB.   The Renewed Proceedings in the District Court\n\n            1. Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings\n\n            In light of our decision, the district court re-opened\n\nthe case on June 22, 2006.        Approximately two months later, on\n\nAugust 30, 2006, the Municipality filed a motion for judgment on\n\nthe pleadings, arguing that \"plaintiffs failed to state a theory of\n\npolitical discrimination that, even with evidentiary support, would\n\nconstitute a violation of said parties' First Amendment rights.\"\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).   Plaintiffs opposed the motion and asked\n\nthe court to impose sanctions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1927, because\n\nof   defendants'   unreasonable    and   vexatious      multiplication   of\n\nproceedings.2\n\n            On December 1, 2006, the district court denied the\n\nMunicipality's motion for judgment on the pleadings, noting our\n\nruling in the first appeal that the complaint adequately pleaded a\n\nFirst Amendment retaliation claim.        It also granted plaintiffs'\n\n\n\n      2\n         28 U.S.C. § 1927 reads: \"Any attorney . . . who so\nmultiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously\nmay be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess\ncosts, expenses, and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred because of\nsuch conduct.\"\n\n                                   -6-\n\fmotion    for    sanctions      because    we   had    already     decided      that\n\ndefendants' arguments lacked merit.3            Quoting our decision in Cruz\n\nv. Savage, 896 F.2d 626, 632 (1st Cir. 1990), it noted that \"[t]his\n\nis the type of multiplying of proceedings that § 1927 is designed\n\nto avoid . . . . Counsel for the Municipality acted 'in disregard\n\nof   whether    his   conduct    constitute[d]        harassment    .   .   .   thus\n\ndisplaying a serious and studied disregard for the orderly process\n\nof justice.'\"     The court went on to say:\n\n            Filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings,\n            based in arguments already rejected by a court\n            of higher level is clearly vexatious conduct\n            that disregards the orderly process of justice\n            and must be sanctioned . . . . If the\n            Municipality, or its Counsel, disagreed with\n            the First Circuit's decision, it should have\n            filed a [petition for] certiorari before the\n            United States Supreme Court.4\n\nThe district court ordered the defendants to pay $2,000 to the\n\nplaintiffs      \"in   satisfaction    of    excess      costs,     expenses,     and\n\nattorneys' fees they reasonably incurred in re-litigating an issues\n\npreviously ruled on by a higher court.\"\n\n\n      3\n        The standard for evaluating a motion to dismiss is the same\nas that for a motion for judgment on the pleadings. See, e.g.,\nCitibank Global Markets, Inc., v. Rodríguez Santana, et al., 573\nF.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 2009) (\"to survive a motion to dismiss (or a\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings), the complaint must plead\nfacts that raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\");\nsee also Charles Alan Wright and Arthur R. Miller, 5 Federal\nPractice and Procedure § 1203 (\"[T]he form and sufficiency of a\nstatement of a claim for relief under Rule 8(a)(2) may be tested by\na motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief\ncan be granted, Rule 12(b)(6), [or] by a motion for judgment on the\npleadings, Rule 12(c) . . . .\").\n      4\n          The defendants never filed such a petition.\n\n                                      -7-\n\f            2. Discovery violations\n\n            On September 18, 2006 , October 11, 2006, and January 9,\n\n2007, plaintiffs moved to compel the production of requested\n\ndiscovery and for sanctions based on defendants' consistent failure\n\nto provide discovery, as well as their alleged failures to appear\n\nat scheduled depositions and to respond to a subpoena duces tecum.\n\nDefendants opposed the motions, arguing, inter alia, that they had\n\nnot answered the discovery requests because they had objected to\n\nthem.\n\n            On April 19, 2007, the district court granted plaintiffs'\n\nmotions to compel and denied their motions for sanctions.              Because\n\nthe response to plaintiffs' motions to compel depended on the\n\nmerits of defendants' objections to the requests for discovery, the\n\ncourt    painstakingly    addressed   each    of    defendants'     objections.\n\nBefore    compelling     the   production    of    any   of   the   objected-to\n\nmaterials, it explained why it disagreed with the defendants that\n\nthe requested information was either irrelevant or privileged.\n\n            In rejecting plaintiffs' request for sanctions, the court\n\nexplained that it did not fault the defendants for refusing to\n\nproduce the objected-to documents until the court had ruled on\n\nthose objections. It did, however, admonish the defendants for not\n\nproducing other documents to which it had not objected. It went on:\n\n\n            We refuse . . . to make an account here of\n            each document requested and produced, and\n            those which remain to be produced. Defendants\n            are to make such an exercise and comply with\n\n                                      -8-\n\f           this order by the time provided below . . . .\n           Should counsel continue to have differences of\n           this sort, the Court will schedule such a\n           conference and will not hesitate to impose\n           sanctions   upon   the   party   engaging   in\n           professional misconduct, or both parties if\n           the Court finds both responsible.\n\n           3.   Default Judgment\n\n           Despite the district court's admonishment, defendants\n\nfailed to respond to the discovery requests on time.               Instead,\n\napproximately two weeks after the new deadline for the discovery\n\nresponses, defendants, according to plaintiffs, \"delivered . . . a\n\nhodgepodge of documents, unnumbered, unidentified, and without any\n\nattempt to specify which document related to which request.\"\n\nPlaintiffs then asked the court to impose a default judgment as a\n\nsanction for defendants' failure to provide responsive discovery.\n\nOn December 6, 2007, the district court granted that motion.\n\n           Again, the court carefully explained its reasoning. It\n\nsaid that the defendants' failure to respond adequately was \"just\n\nthe cherry on top of the sundae,\" in light of defendants' many\n\nother failures to abide by its orders.        It described the troubled\n\nhistory of the discovery process in this case and how it had\n\npreviously sternly warned defendants that it would issue sanctions\n\nfor failure to comply with its April 19, 2007 order.              The court\n\nalso listed four separate orders it had issued during the course of\n\nthe litigation warning defendants that it would issue sanctions if\n\nthey   failed   to   cooperate   with   discovery,   and   also   cited   its\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fDecember   1,    2006   order   imposing       sanctions   for   defendants'\n\n\"vexatious\" and \"stubborn\" conduct.\n\n           4.   The \"Motion to Set Aside Default\"\n\n           A hearing on damages was set for March 24, 2008.               On\n\nEaster Sunday, the eve of trial, the Municipality moved in the\n\ndistrict court to set aside the default judgment, arguing that the\n\n\"recent\" decision of Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544\n\n(2007), mandated that result. In fact, Twombly had been decided in\n\nMay 2007 -- ten months before the Municipality's motion \"to set\n\naside default\" and two months before the entry of default judgment.\n\nIn their motion, defendants once again argued that the complaint\n\ndid not state a claim for relief.         This time, they added the new\n\ntwist that \"under Twombly, plaintiffs' complaint would never have\n\nsurvived defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\"\n\n           On March 24, 2008, the district court rejected the\n\n\"eleventh hour\" motion as both \"untimely\" and \"without merit.\" The\n\ncourt   characterized    the    motion    as    a   \"misnamed\"   motion   for\n\nreconsideration of the defendants' earlier motion for judgment on\n\nthe pleadings, because it only argued the sufficiency of the\n\npleadings and did not otherwise argue that the default was an abuse\n\nof discretion.    The court stated that:\n\n           [U]nder the more stringent Twombly standard,\n           Plaintiffs still plead a cause of action.\n           They argue that they were entitled to some\n           payments   under   a    contract   with   the\n           Municipality and that the new Mayor, a member\n           of the PDP, refused to pay them only because\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f               of Plaintiffs' association with the former\n               Mayor, a member of the NPP.\n\nCiting our earlier decision in this case, the court remarked that\n\n\"said    discrimination     is   exactly      what   the    First   Amendment    is\n\ndesigned to protect, and therefore, [plaintiffs] have plead enough\n\nto show plausible entitlement to relief under the First Amendment.\"\n\nAfter the damages hearing, the court entered judgments of $180,000,\n\nplus    pre-    and   post-judgment     interest,     for    both   Remexcel    and\n\nKortright.        This appeal followed.\n\n                                        II.\n\n               Defendants   challenge    the    imposition     of   the   default\n\njudgment as a sanction for their repeated discovery violations. We\n\nreview the entry of a default judgment for abuse of discretion.\n\nDiaz-Fonseca v. Puerto Rico, 451 F.3d 13, 25-26 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\nThe party challenging this type of sanction \"'bears a heavy burden\n\nof demonstrating that the trial judge was clearly not justified in\n\nentering an order of [default] under Rule 37.'\"                      Id. at 25,\n\n(modification in original) (quoting Spiller v. U.S.V. Labs, Inc.,\n\n842 F.2d 535, 537 (1st Cir. 1988)).\n\n               The entry of a default judgment \"provides a useful remedy\n\nwhen a litigant is confronted by an obstructionist adversary and\n\nplays a constructive role in maintaining the orderly and efficient\n\nadministration of justice.\" KPS & Assocs., Inc. v. Designs by FMC,\n\nInc., 318 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 2003) (quotation marks and citation\n\nomitted).       Nonetheless, it is a \"drastic\" sanction, Affanato v.\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fMerrill Bros., 547 F.2d 138, 140 (1st Cir. 1977) (quotation marks\n\nand citation omitted), that runs contrary to the goals of resolving\n\ncases on the merits and           avoiding \"harsh or unfair results.\"              KPS\n\n& Assocs., 318 F.3d at 13 (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n\"Since default judgments implicate sharply conflicting policies .\n\n. . the trial judge, who is usually the person most familiar with\n\nthe circumstances of the case and is in the best position to\n\nevaluate    the    good    faith    and     credibility   of    the   parties,     is\n\nentrusted     with        the     task     of     balancing    these     competing\n\nconsiderations.\"      Id. (quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n            Defendants have but one argument in support of their\n\ncontention   that    the        district    court   abused    its    discretion     in\n\nentering the default judgment -- namely, that the district court\n\nabused its discretion in ordering the production of the documents\n\nin the first place.        \"District courts exercise broad discretion to\n\nmanage discovery matters,\" and we review discovery orders for abuse\n\nof   discretion.

Tokyo    Kikai\n\nSeisakusho, Ltd., 333 F.3d 38, 41 (1st Cir. 2003).                       \"[W]e may\n\nreverse a district court only upon a clear showing of manifest\n\ninjustice, that is, where the lower court's discovery order was\n\nplainly    wrong    and    resulted        in   substantial    prejudice      to   the\n\naggrieved party.\"         In re: Subpoena to Witzel, 531 F.3d 113, 117\n\n(1st Cir. 2008) (quotation marks and citations omitted).\n\n            The court carefully categorized the interrogatories and\n\ndocument requests by the type of information sought, and then\n\n                                           -12-\n\fexplained why the information in each category was relevant.                     For\n\nexample, for one such category the court explained:\n\n                 All of the questions and requests for\n                 documents directed to establish the reasons\n                 for the terminations or non renewal of\n                 Plaintiffs'    contract   and    the    persons\n                 responsible for or having knowledge of these\n                 reasons are clearly relevant to determine\n                 whether the termination of their contracts was\n                 neutral or discriminatory in nature.      Also,\n                 all questions that might lead to information\n                 about   the  circumstances    surrounding   the\n                 termination or non renewal of Plaintiffs'\n                 contract with the Municipality are relevant as\n                 well.\n\n\nFor    another      category   of   requests,     the    court   explained       that\n\n\"questions related to changes in the Municipality's personnel after\n\nMayor Arlequín took over are relevant to Plaintiffs' allegations\n\nthat       the    Mayor   engaged   in     a    custom    and/or      practice     of\n\ndiscriminating against all employees and contractors hired or\n\nengaged by the prior administration.\"               In the end, almost every\n\nobjection was categorized in this manner and the court's rejection\n\nof it explained.          The scope of discovery is broad, and \"to be\n\ndiscoverable,        information    need   only   appear    to   be    'reasonably\n\ncalculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.'\"5\n\n\n       5\n       The district court recognized this principle, writing, for\nexample, that \"[t]he production of said evidence might lead to\ncircumstantial evidence in support of Plaintiff's case.\"         In\nsupport of that conclusion, the court cited our decision in\nPueguero-Moronta v. Gabriel Santiago, 464 F.3d 29, 45 (1st Cir.\n2006), for the proposition that \"[a] plaintiff bringing a political\ndiscrimination claim bears the burden of producing sufficient\ndirect or circumstantial evidence from which a jury reasonably may\ninfer that [his] constitutionally protected conduct -- in this\n\n                                         -13-\n\fCusumano v. Microsoft Corp., 162 F.3d 708, 716 n.5 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(1)).\n\n            The district court was patient, careful, and fair in its\n\nchoice of sanctions.        The court had issued four warnings over the\n\ncourse of the litigation specifically directed at defendants'\n\nfailures to respond to discovery requests.              It had previously\n\nissued milder sanctions for defendants' \"vexatious\" behavior.             In\n\nApril 2007, as noted, the court painstakingly addressed each of the\n\nobjected-to      discovery    requests   and   explained   why    they   were\n\nrelevant, declining to issue sanctions at that time but again\n\nwarning defendants of the harsh possibilities for failure to\n\nrespond.      Further, it reprimanded defendants at that time for\n\nfailing to produce documents to which it had not objected, and for\n\nobjecting to requests for documents that it was automatically\n\nobligated   to    produce    \"without    awaiting   a   discovery   request\"\n\npursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1).            The court's\n\nchoice of sanctions as well as the sternness of its warnings\n\ngradually escalated over the course of the litigation in response\n\nto defendants' persistently troublesome conduct.                 Under these\n\ncircumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion by\n\nentering a default judgment in response to defendants' repeated\n\n\n\n\ncase, political affiliation . . . was a substantial or motivating\nfactor   behind   [his]   dismissal.\"  (Emphasis   added,   other\nmodifications in original.)\n\n                                    -14-\n\ffailures to respond to discovery.            Indeed, its handling of the\n\nvexatious discovery conduct was exemplary.\n\n                                     III.\n\n          Defendants concede that \"an entry of default prevents the\n\ndefendant from disputing the truth of well-pleaded facts in the\n\ncomplaint pertaining to liability.\"           Conetta v. Nat'l Hair Care\n\nCtrs., Inc., 236 F.3d 67, 75-76 (1st Cir. 2001) (citing Goldman,\n\nAntonetti, Ferraiuoli, Axtmayer & Hertell v. Medfit Int'l, Inc.,\n\n982 F.2d 686, 693 (1st Cir. 1993)).         They argue, however, that they\n\nmay still contest the sufficiency of the pleadings before them. It\n\nis true that in the normal case after the entry of default a\n\n\"defendant may still contest a claim on the ground that the\n\ncomplaint does not allege facts that add up to the elements of a\n\ncause of action.\"     Id. at 76; see also Gowen v. F/V Quality One,\n\n244 F.3d 64, 67 n.2 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"The default judgment is\n\nconclusive as to facts but does not always defeat later legal\n\nobjections\" such as failure to state a claim).\n\n          This,    however,     is   not    the    normal   case.        We   have\n\npreviously held that plaintiffs' claim does adequately plead the\n\nelements of a cause of action.          Ramírez, 447 F.3d 25 (\"Remexcel\n\nand   Kortright    must   plead      that   they    engaged       in    protected\n\nassociation,   that   they    were   entitled      to   payment    under      their\n\ncontracts,   and   that   the   Municipality       denied   the        payment   in\n\nretaliation for their exercise of associational rights.                       These\n\nelements are adequately pleaded in the complaint.\") (citing Baker\n\n                                     -15-\n\fv. Coxe, 230 F.3d 470, 475 (1st Cir. 2000)).       In light of this\n\nhistory, the law of the case doctrine poses an obstacle to our\n\nreconsideration of the adequacy of the complaint.\n\n            The law of the case doctrine \"posits that when a court\n\ndecides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to\n\ngovern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\"\n\nArizona v. California, 460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983).   The doctrine has\n\ntwo branches.     The first, relied upon by the district court in\n\nrejecting the motion for judgment on the pleadings, \"'prevents\n\nrelitigation in the trial court of matters that were explicitly or\n\nimplicitly decided by an earlier appellate decision in the same\n\ncase.'\"    United States v. Wallace, 573 F.3d 82, 88 (1st Cir. 2009)\n\n(quoting    United States v. Moran, 393 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004)).\n\nThe second branch, which is implicated here, \"binds successor\n\nappellate panels in a second appeal in the same case unless\n\ncertain circumstances justify reconsideration.\" Negron-Alameda v.\n\nSantiago, No. 08-2360, 2009 WL 2605717 at *3 (1st Cir. Aug. 26,\n\n2009).     This branch \"contemplates that a legal decision made at\n\none stage of a criminal or civil proceeding should remain the law\n\nof that case throughout the litigation, unless and until the\n\ndecision is modified or overruled by a higher court.\"    Moran, 393\n\nF.3d at 7.     We have described the many \"salutary policies\" that\n\nunderlie the law of the case doctrine, including:      \"afford[ing]\n\nlitigants a high degree of certainty as to what claims are -- and\n\nare not -- still open for adjudication\"; \"further[ing] the abiding\n\n                                -16-\n\finterest shared by both litigants and the public in finality and\n\nrepose\"; \"promot[ing] efficiency\"; and \"increas[ing] confidence in\n\nthe adjudicatory process.\"         Ellis v. United States, 313 F.3d 636,\n\n647 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            There are, however, exceptions to the law of the case\n\ndoctrine's \"presumption against reconsideration.\"               Id. at 647-48.\n\nDefendants    argue   that   one   such     exception   is    applicable   here\n\ninvolving \"a material change in controlling law.\"              Id. at 648.   In\n\nDoe v. Anring, for example, we revisited an earlier ruling because\n\nin the period between the first and second appeal we had, in a\n\ndifferent case, \"reconsidered the interpretation of federal law\n\nset forth in Doe v. Anrig I, and we concluded that it was\n\nerroneous.\"    728 F.2d 30, 31 (1st Cir. 1984).\n\n            The defendants argue that we have a similar situation\n\nhere because, in the period between the first appeal and this one,\n\nthe Supreme Court clarified the standard for determining the\n\nadequacy of pleadings.        In Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, the Supreme\n\nCourt rejected an earlier description of the standard for stating\n\na claim, set forth in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46 (1957),\n\nand quoted in our first decision in this case.               Ramirez, 447 F.3d\n\nat 24-25.     Twombly rejected Conley's statement that            \"a complaint\n\nshould not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it\n\nappears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of\n\nfacts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\"\n\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fTwombly, 550 U.S. at 561 (quoting Conley, 355 U.S. at 45-46).                The\n\nTwombly court explained that:\n\n          We could go on, but there is no need to pile\n          up further citations to show that Conley's \"no\n          set of facts\" language has been questioned,\n          criticized,    and   explained    away    long\n          enough. . . . The phrase is best forgotten as\n          an incomplete, negative gloss on an accepted\n          pleading standard: once a claim has been\n          stated adequately, it may be supported by\n          showing any set of facts consistent with the\n          allegations in the complaint.\n\nId. at 562-63.    Twombly explained that a sufficient complaint must\n\ncontain \"allegations plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent\n\nwith)\" entitlement to relief.         Id. at 557.        It further explained:\n\n          [W]e do not require heightened fact pleading\n          of specifics, but only enough facts to state\n          a claim to relief that is plausible on its\n          face. Because the plaintiffs here have not\n          nudged their claims across the line from\n          conceivable to plausible, their complaint must\n          be dismissed.\n\nId. at 570.\n\n          We     agree   with   the   district      court     that   even   after\n\nTwombly's clarification of the pleading standard, plaintiffs have\n\nstill pleaded a cause of action.6             Although our earlier opinion\n\nparenthetically    quoted   Conley's         \"no   set   of   facts\"   language,\n\nRamirez, 447 F.3d at 24-25, we did not base our decision in that\n\n\n     6\n        The district court admonished the defendants for raising\nthis argument so late in the game -- Twombly had been decided ten\nmonths before the defendants moved for re-evaluation of the\npleadings in light of that case. Furthermore, Twombly had already\nbeen decided when the district court entered the default judgment.\nNevertheless, because the district court reached the arguments on\nthe merits, we do as well.\n\n                                      -18-\n\fcase on the remote possibility that plaintiffs would eventually\n\nshow some unknown set of facts to support their claim.              Indeed, in\n\ndescribing how Conley's \"no set of facts\" language has been\n\n\"questioned, criticized, and explained away long enough,\" the\n\nSupreme Court listed our circuit as an example of the \"judges and\n\ncommentators [who] have balked at taking the literal terms of the\n\nConley passage as a pleading standard.\"           Twombly, 550 U.S. at 562.\n\nIt parenthetically quoted our opinion in O'Brien v. DiGrazia, 544\n\nF.2d 543, 546 n.3 (1st Cir. 1976), where we stated that \"when a\n\nplaintiff under § 1983 supplies facts to support his claim, we do\n\nnot think that Conley imposes a duty on the courts to conjure up\n\nunpleaded    facts      that   might     turn    a   frivolous      claim    of\n\nunconstitutional     official    action       into   a     substantial     one.\"\n\nAlthough we did not explain our earlier decision using Twombly's\n\nlanguage, we essentially concluded, in conformity with Twombly's\n\nrequirements, that plaintiffs had pleaded \"enough facts to state\n\na claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\"                Twombly, 550\n\nU.S. at 570.      Twombly does not, therefore, present a change in\n\nintervening law that justifies the application of the exception to\n\nthe law of the case doctrine dependent on such a change.                 Ellis,\n\n313 F.3d at 648.\n\n            The   law    of    the     case     doctrine     thus   bars     our\n\nreconsideration of defendants' claim that the plaintiffs have not\n\npled a cognizable theory of retaliation under the First Amendment.\n\nIf defendants feel victimized by this outcome, they have only\n\n                                     -19-\n\fthemselves to blame.   Their stubborn refusal to participate in\n\ndiscovery precluded the possibility of any factual development\n\nthat might have helped their case.   Disobeying the orders of the\n\ntrial court has exacted a heavy price.       Defendants have now\n\nforfeited the opportunity to make their arguments on a more\n\ndeveloped record.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -20-\n\f",

Vázquez III, for appellees.</p>\n<p>Before TORRUELLA, TASHIMA,<sup>[*]</sup> and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>We consider for the second time this political discrimination case, in which plaintiffs claim they were denied payment for services performed on behalf of the municipality of Guayanilla, Puerto Rico, in violation of the First Amendment. In the original appeal, we vacated the district court's dismissal of the case for failure to state a claim, holding that the plaintiffs' complaint adequately pleaded the necessary elements of a political discrimination action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. <i>Ramírez v. Arlequín,</i> 447 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir.2006). Subsequent to our decision, the district court reinstated the claims and eventually entered a default judgment against defendants, the municipality of Guayanilla, Puerto Rico (\"the Municipality\"), and its mayor, Edgardo Arlequín, as a result of repeated discovery violations.</p>\n<p>In this appeal, defendants argue that: 1) the district court abused its discretion in entering the default judgment, and 2) even in light of the default judgment, the plaintiffs cannot prevail because their complaint does not make out a prima facie case of political discrimination. For reasons we shall explain, we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion in the entry of a default judgment, and that the law of the case doctrine bars defendants' attempt to reargue the adequacy of plaintiffs' complaint. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Background</h2>\n<p>Although the background facts of this complaint are described in our earlier decision in this case, <i>id.</i> at 20-22, we will recount them here succinctly. Plaintiff Remexcel Managerial Consultants (\"Remexcel\") is a company owned by Reinaldo Ramírez. Remexcel entered into a contract with the former mayor of Guayanilla, Ceferino Pacheco Guidicelli (\"Mayor Pacheco\"), a member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), to perform accounting services for the Municipality that would identify residents who owed taxes. <i>Id.</i> at 20-21. Remexcel was to receive ten percent of the money obtained as a result of its services. When Remexcel identified a tax deficiency of $4,444,058.87 owed to the Municipality by Stinnes Interoil, an oil supply company, the Municipality informed Stinnes of that determination, and Stinnes filed a lawsuit against the Municipality in Puerto Rico Superior Court seeking to dispute any outstanding tax liability. <i>See Veba Oil Supply v. Municipality of Guyanilla,</i> Civ. No. JCO 96-003 (Super.Ct.Ponce).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> Plaintiff María S. Kortright is a lawyer who was hired by Mayor Pacheco and the Municipality to defend that lawsuit under a contingency arrangement which, like the agreement with Remexcel, would pay her ten percent of the money collected as a result of her work. <i>Ramírez,</i> 447 F.3d at 21. Working on the case until 2000, Kortright filed the summary judgment motions which led to a favorable resolution of the case for the Municipality. <i>Id.</i> After she performed this work, however, defendant Edgardo Arlequín (\"Mayor Arlequín\") took office, replacing Mayor Pacheco. Mayor Arlequín is a member of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"). <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The complaint alleges that after taking office, Mayor Arlequín began \"a pattern and practice of discrimination by taking adverse action against anyone associated with the prior New Progressive Party administration at any level,\" and, as a result, refused to continue the Municipality's professional association with the plaintiffs. Kortright was replaced as counsel for the <i>Veba Oil</i> case. According to the complaint, \"[t]he new counsel did nothing of record but enter his appearance before the court granted summary judgment for the Municipality in the amount of $4.5 million, based on Kortright's work.\" <i>Id.</i> The new lawyer then settled the suit for $1.8 million to be paid to the Municipality. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging, inter alia, that their First Amendment associational rights were violated because Mayor Arlequín and the Municipality refused to pay them money they were rightfully owed solely because of their association with Mayor Pacheco. Defendants moved in the district court to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim. The district court granted the motion, concluding that, pursuant to the Supreme Court's decisions in <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> 427 U.S. 347, 96 S.Ct. 2673, 49 L.Ed.2d 547 (1976), and <i>Branti v. Finkel,</i> 445 U.S. 507, 100 S.Ct. 1287, 63 L.Ed.2d 574 (1980), plaintiffs' jobs were not entitled to protection from political discrimination because they involved policymaking positions. <i>Ramírez,</i> 447 F.3d at 21-22.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>In the appeal brought by plaintiffs, we were \"called upon to decide whether a deliberate executive decision by a state actor, based only on a partisan political change of administration, to deprive independent contractors of a payment to which they are legally entitled, violates the contractors' First Amendment rights.\" <i>Id.</i> at 20. Ruling favorably for the plaintiffs, we concluded that the <i>Elrod/Branti</i> doctrine's exemption of policymakers from protection against political affiliation discrimination does not apply \"to someone who is neither a government employee nor seeks a continuing relationship with the government, but who merely asks to be paid in accordance with a contract which that person has already performed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 23. We wrote that, \"[a]lthough we must always be concerned about constitutionalizing traditional common law claims, we see no theoretical bar to the First Amendment claim that is alleged here.\" <i>Id.</i> We went on to say that \"Remexcel and Kortright must plead that they engaged in protected association, that they were entitled to payment under their contracts, and that the Municipality denied the payment in retaliation for their exercise of associational rights. These elements are adequately pleaded in the complaint.\" <i>Id.</i> at 25 (citation omitted). Hence we reversed the district court's dismissal of Remexcel's and Kortright's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> First Amendment retaliation claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Renewed Proceedings in the District Court</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings</h2>\n<p>In light of our decision, the district court re-opened the case on June 22, 2006. Approximately two months later, on August 30, 2006, the Municipality filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that \"plaintiffs failed to state a theory of political discrimination that, even with evidentiary support, would constitute a violation of said parties' First Amendment rights.\" <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). Plaintiffs opposed the motion and asked the court to impose sanctions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1927, because of defendants' unreasonable and vexatious multiplication of proceedings.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>On December 1, 2006, the district court denied the Municipality's motion for judgment on the pleadings, noting our ruling in the first appeal that the complaint adequately pleaded a First Amendment retaliation claim. It also granted plaintiffs' motion for sanctions because we had already decided that defendants' arguments lacked merit.<sup>[3]</sup> Quoting our decision in <i>Cruz v. Savage,</i> 896 F.2d 626, 632 (1st Cir. 1990), it noted that \"[t]his is the type of multiplying of proceedings that § 1927 is designed to avoid.... Counsel for the Municipality acted `in disregard of whether his conduct constitute[d] harassment ... thus displaying a serious and studied disregard for the orderly process of justice.'\" The court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote>Filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings, based in arguments already rejected by a court of higher level is clearly vexatious conduct that disregards the orderly process of justice and must be sanctioned.... If the Municipality, or its Counsel, disagreed with the First Circuit's decision, it should have filed a [petition for] certiorari before the United States Supreme Court.<sup>[4]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>The district court ordered the defendants to pay $2,000 to the plaintiffs \"in satisfaction of excess costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees they reasonably incurred in relitigating an issues previously ruled on by a higher court.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Discovery violations</h2>\n<p>On September 18, 2006, October 11, 2006, and January 9, 2007, plaintiffs moved to compel the production of requested discovery and for sanctions based on defendants' consistent failure to provide discovery, as well as their alleged failures to appear at scheduled depositions and to respond to a subpoena duces tecum. Defendants opposed the motions, arguing, inter alia, that they had not answered the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> discovery requests because they had objected to them.</p>\n<p>On April 19, 2007, the district court granted plaintiffs' motions to compel and denied their motions for sanctions. Because the response to plaintiffs' motions to compel depended on the merits of defendants' objections to the requests for discovery, the court painstakingly addressed each of defendants' objections. Before compelling the production of any of the objected-to materials, it explained why it disagreed with the defendants that the requested information was either irrelevant or privileged.</p>\n<p>In rejecting plaintiffs' request for sanctions, the court explained that it did not fault the defendants for refusing to produce the objected-to documents until the court had ruled on those objections. It did, however, admonish the defendants for not producing other documents to which it had not objected. It went on:</p>\n<blockquote>We refuse ... to make an account here of each document requested and produced, and those which remain to be produced. Defendants are to make such an exercise and comply with this order by the time provided below.... Should counsel continue to have differences of this sort, the Court will schedule such a conference and will not hesitate to impose sanctions upon the party engaging in professional misconduct, or both parties if the Court finds both responsible.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Default Judgment</h2>\n<p>Despite the district court's admonishment, defendants failed to respond to the discovery requests on time. Instead, approximately two weeks after the new deadline for the discovery responses, defendants, according to plaintiffs, \"delivered... a hodgepodge of documents, unnumbered, unidentified, and without any attempt to specify which document related to which request.\" Plaintiffs then asked the court to impose a default judgment as a sanction for defendants' failure to provide responsive discovery. On December 6, 2007, the district court granted that motion.</p>\n<p>Again, the court carefully explained its reasoning. It said that the defendants' failure to respond adequately was \"just the cherry on top of the sundae,\" in light of defendants' many other failures to abide by its orders. It described the troubled history of the discovery process in this case and how it had previously sternly warned defendants that it would issue sanctions for failure to comply with its April 19, 2007 order. The court also listed four separate orders it had issued during the course of the litigation warning defendants that it would issue sanctions if they failed to cooperate with discovery, and also cited its December 1, 2006 order imposing sanctions for defendants' \"vexatious\" and \"stubborn\" conduct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. The \"Motion to Set Aside Default\"</h2>\n<p>A hearing on damages was set for March 24, 2008. On Easter Sunday, the eve of trial, the Municipality moved in the district court to set aside the default judgment, arguing that the \"recent\" decision of <i>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007), mandated that result. In fact, <i>Twombly</i> had been decided in May 2007 ten months before the Municipality's motion \"to set aside default\" and two months before the entry of default judgment. In their motion, defendants once again argued that the complaint did not state a claim for relief. This time, they added the new twist that \"under <i>Twombly,</i> plaintiffs' complaint would never have survived defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\"</p>\n<p>On March 24, 2008, the district court rejected the \"eleventh hour\" motion as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> both \"untimely\" and \"without merit.\" The court characterized the motion as a \"misnamed\" motion for reconsideration of the defendants' earlier motion for judgment on the pleadings, because it only argued the sufficiency of the pleadings and did not otherwise argue that the default was an abuse of discretion. The court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote>[U]nder the more stringent <i>Twombly</i> standard, Plaintiffs still plead a cause of action. They argue that they were entitled to some payments under a contract with the Municipality and that the new Mayor, a member of the PDP, refused to pay them only because of Plaintiffs' association with the former Mayor, a member of the NPP.</blockquote>\n<p>Citing our earlier decision in this case, the court remarked that \"said discrimination is exactly what the First Amendment is designed to protect, and therefore, [plaintiffs] have plead enough to show plausible entitlement to relief under the First Amendment.\" After the damages hearing, the court entered judgments of $180,000, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, for both Remexcel and Kortright. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Defendants challenge the imposition of the default judgment as a sanction for their repeated discovery violations. We review the entry of a default judgment for abuse of discretion. <i>Diaz-Fonseca v. Puerto Rico,</i> 451 F.3d 13, 25-26 (1st Cir. 2006). The party challenging this type of sanction \"`bears a heavy burden of demonstrating that the trial judge was clearly not justified in entering an order of [default] under Rule 37.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 25, (modification in original) (quoting <i>Spiller v. U.S.V. Labs., Inc.,</i> 842 F.2d 535, 537 (1st Cir. 1988)).</p>\n<p>The entry of a default judgment \"provides a useful remedy when a litigant is confronted by an obstructionist adversary and plays a constructive role in maintaining the orderly and efficient administration of justice.\" <i>KPS &amp; Assocs., Inc. v. Designs by FMC, Inc.,</i> 318 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir.2003) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Nonetheless, it is a \"drastic\" sanction, <i>Affanato v. Merrill Bros.,</i> 547 F.2d 138, 140 (1st Cir.1977) (quotation marks and citation omitted), that runs contrary to the goals of resolving cases on the merits and avoiding \"harsh or unfair results.\" <i>KPS &amp; Assocs.,</i> 318 F.3d at 13 (quotation marks and citation omitted). \"Since default judgments implicate sharply conflicting policies ... the trial judge, who is usually the person most familiar with the circumstances of the case and is in the best position to evaluate the good faith and credibility of the parties, is entrusted with the task of balancing these competing considerations.\" <i>Id.</i> (quotation marks and citation omitted).</p>\n<p>Defendants have but one argument in support of their contention that the district court abused its discretion in entering the default judgmentnamely, that the district court abused its discretion in ordering the production of the documents in the first place. \"District courts exercise broad discretion to manage discovery matters,\" and we review discovery orders for abuse of discretion. <i>Heidelberg Americas, Inc. v. Tokyo Kikai Seisakusho, Ltd.,</i> 333 F.3d 38, 41 (1st Cir.2003). \"[W]e may reverse a district court only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice, that is, where the lower court's discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\" <i>In re: Subpoena to Witzel,</i> 531 F.3d 113, 117 (1st Cir.2008) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The court carefully categorized the interrogatories and document requests by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> the type of information sought, and then explained why the information in each category was relevant. For example, for one such category the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>All of the questions and requests for documents directed to establish the reasons for the terminations or non renewal of Plaintiffs' contract and the persons responsible for or having knowledge of these reasons are clearly relevant to determine whether the termination of their contracts was neutral or discriminatory in nature. Also, all questions that might lead to information about the circumstances surrounding the termination or non renewal of Plaintiffs' contract with the Municipality are relevant as well.</blockquote>\n<p>For another category of requests, the court explained that \"questions related to changes in the Municipality's personnel after Mayor Arlequín took over are relevant to Plaintiffs' allegations that the Mayor engaged in a custom and/or practice of discriminating against all employees and contractors hired or engaged by the prior administration.\" In the end, almost every objection was categorized in this manner and the court's rejection of it explained. The scope of discovery is broad, and \"to be discoverable, information need only appear to be `reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.'\"<sup>[5]</sup><i>Cusumano v. Microsoft Corp.,</i> 162 F.3d 708, 716 n. 5 (1st Cir.1998) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1)).</p>\n<p>The district court was patient, careful, and fair in its choice of sanctions. The court had issued four warnings over the course of the litigation specifically directed at defendants' failures to respond to discovery requests. It had previously issued milder sanctions for defendants' \"vexatious\" behavior. In April 2007, as noted, the court painstakingly addressed each of the objected-to discovery requests and explained why they were relevant, declining to issue sanctions at that time but again warning defendants of the harsh possibilities for failure to respond. Further, it reprimanded defendants at that time for failing to produce documents to which it had not objected, and for objecting to requests for documents that it was automatically obligated to produce \"without awaiting a discovery request\" pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1). The court's choice of sanctions as well as the sternness of its warnings gradually escalated over the course of the litigation in response to defendants' persistently troublesome conduct. Under these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion by entering a default judgment in response to defendants' repeated failures to respond to discovery. Indeed, its handling of the vexatious discovery conduct was exemplary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Defendants concede that \"an entry of default prevents the defendant from disputing the truth of well-pleaded facts in the complaint pertaining to liability.\" <i>Conetta v. Nat'l Hair Care Ctrs., Inc.,</i> 236 F.3d 67, 75-76 (1st Cir.2001) (citing <i>Goldman, Antonetti, Ferraiuoli, Axtmayer &amp; Hertell v. Medfit Int'l, Inc.,</i> 982 F.2d 686, 693 (1st Cir.1993)). They argue, however, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> that they may still contest the sufficiency of the pleadings before them. It is true that in the normal case after the entry of default a \"defendant may still contest a claim on the ground that the complaint does not allege facts that add up to the elements of a cause of action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 76; <i>see also </i><i>Gowen v. F/V Quality One,</i> 244 F.3d 64, 67 n. 2 (1st Cir.2001) (\"The default judgment is conclusive as to facts but does not always defeat later legal objections\" such as failure to state a claim).</p>\n<p>This, however, is not the normal case. We have previously held that plaintiffs' claim does adequately plead the elements of a cause of action. <i>Ramírez,</i> 447 F.3d at 25 (\"Remexcel and Kortright must plead that they engaged in protected association, that they were entitled to payment under their contracts, and that the Municipality denied the payment in retaliation for their exercise of associational rights. These elements are adequately pleaded in the complaint.\") (citing <i>Baker v. Coxe,</i> 230 F.3d 470, 475 (1st Cir.2000)). In light of this history, the law of the case doctrine poses an obstacle to our reconsideration of the adequacy of the complaint.</p>\n<p>The law of the case doctrine \"posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\" <i>Arizona v. California,</i> 460 U.S. 605, 618, 103 S.Ct. 1382, 75 L.Ed.2d 318 (1983). The doctrine has two branches. The first, relied upon by the district court in rejecting the motion for judgment on the pleadings, \"`prevents relitigation in the trial court of matters that were explicitly or implicitly decided by an earlier appellate decision in the same case.'\" <i>United States v. Wallace,</i> 573 F.3d 82, 88 (1st Cir.2009) (quoting <i>United States v. Moran,</i> 393 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004)). The second branch, which is implicated here, \"binds successor appellate panels in a second appeal in the same case unless certain circumstances justify reconsideration.\" <i>Negron-Almeda v. Santiago,</i> 579 F.3d 45, 50 (1st Cir.2009). This branch \"contemplates that a legal decision made at one stage of a criminal or civil proceeding should remain the law of that case throughout the litigation, unless and until the decision is modified or overruled by a higher court.\" <i>Moran,</i> 393 F.3d at 7. We have described the many \"salutary policies\" that underlie the law of the case doctrine, including: \"afford[ing] litigants a high degree of certainty as to what claims areand are notstill open for adjudication\"; \"further[ing] the abiding interest shared by both litigants and the public in finality and repose\"; \"promot[ing] efficiency\"; and \"increas[ing] confidence in the adjudicatory process.\" <i>Ellis v. United States,</i> 313 F.3d 636, 647 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n<p>There are, however, exceptions to the law of the case doctrine's \"presumption against reconsideration.\" <i>Id.</i> at 647-48. Defendants argue that one such exception is applicable here involving \"a material change in controlling law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 648. In <i>Doe v. Anrig,</i> for example, we revisited an earlier ruling because in the period between the first and second appeal we had, in a different case, \"reconsidered the interpretation of federal law set forth in <i>Doe v. Anrig I,</i> and we concluded that it was erroneous.\" 728 F.2d 30, 31 (1st Cir.1984).</p>\n<p>The defendants argue that we have a similar situation here because, in the period between the first appeal and this one, the Supreme Court clarified the standard for determining the adequacy of pleadings. In <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. 544, 127 S.Ct. 1955, 167 L.Ed.2d 929, the Supreme Court rejected an earlier description of the standard for stating a claim, set forth in <i>Conley v. Gibson,</i> 355 U.S. 41, 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957), and quoted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> in our first decision in this case. <i>Ramirez,</i> 447 F.3d at 24-25. <i>Twombly</i> rejected <i>Conley</i>'s statement that \"a complaint should not be dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond a doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of his claim which would entitle him to relief.\" <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 561, 127 S.Ct. 1955 (quoting <i>Conley,</i> 355 U.S. at 45-46, 78 S.Ct. 99). The <i>Twombly</i> court explained that:</p>\n<blockquote>We could go on, but there is no need to pile up further citations to show that <i>Conley</i>'s \"no set of facts\" language has been questioned, criticized, and explained away long enough.... The phrase is best forgotten as an incomplete, negative gloss on an accepted pleading standard: once a claim has been stated adequately, it may be supported by showing any set of facts consistent with the allegations in the complaint.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 562-63, 127 S.Ct. 1955. <i>Twombly</i> explained that a sufficient complaint must contain \"allegations plausibly suggesting (not merely consistent with)\" entitlement to relief. <i>Id.</i> at 557, 127 S.Ct. 1955. It further explained:</p>\n<blockquote>[W]e do not require heightened fact pleading of specifics, but only enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face. Because the plaintiffs here have not nudged their claims across the line from conceivable to plausible, their complaint must be dismissed.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955.</p>\n<p>We agree with the district court that even after <i>Twombly</i>'s clarification of the pleading standard, plaintiffs have still pleaded a cause of action.<sup>[6]</sup> Although our earlier opinion parenthetically quoted <i>Conley</i>'s \"no set of facts\" language, <i>Ramirez,</i> 447 F.3d at 24-25, we did not base our decision in that case on the remote possibility that plaintiffs would eventually show some unknown set of facts to support their claim. Indeed, in describing how <i>Conley</i>'s \"no set of facts\" language has been \"questioned, criticized, and explained away long enough,\" the Supreme Court listed our circuit as an example of the \"judges and commentators [who] have balked at taking the literal terms of the <i>Conley</i> passage as a pleading standard.\" <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 562, 127 S.Ct. 1955. It parenthetically quoted our opinion in <i>O'Brien v. DiGrazia,</i> 544 F.2d 543, 546 n. 3 (1st Cir.1976), where we stated that \"when a plaintiff under § 1983 supplies facts to support his claim, we do not think that <i>Conley</i> imposes a duty on the courts to conjure up unpleaded facts that might turn a frivolous claim of unconstitutional official action into a substantial one.\" Although we did not explain our earlier decision using <i>Twombly</i>'s language, we essentially concluded, in conformity with <i>Twombly</i>'s requirements, that plaintiffs had pleaded \"enough facts to state a claim to relief that is plausible on its face.\" <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 570, 127 S.Ct. 1955. <i>Twombly</i> does not, therefore, present a change in intervening law that justifies the application of the exception to the law of the case doctrine dependent on such a change. <i>Ellis,</i> 313 F.3d at 648.</p>\n<p>The law of the case doctrine thus bars our reconsideration of defendants' claim that the plaintiffs have not pled a cognizable theory of retaliation under the First Amendment. If defendants feel victimized by this outcome, they have only themselves <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> to blame. Their stubborn refusal to participate in discovery precluded the possibility of any factual development that might have helped their case. Disobeying the orders of the trial court has exacted a heavy price. Defendants have now forfeited the opportunity to make their arguments on a more developed record.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  The district court also determined that, unlike his company Remexcel, plaintiff Ramírez lacked standing to bring suit. We accepted the dismissal of Ramírez's claims because he did not contest that ruling. <i>Id.</i> at 22.</p>\n<p>[2]  28 U.S.C. § 1927 reads: \"Any attorney ... who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  The standard for evaluating a motion to dismiss is the same as that for a motion for judgment on the pleadings. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Citibank Global Markets, Inc.,</i> v. <i>Rodríguez Santana, et al.,</i> 573 F.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir.2009) (\"to survive a motion to dismiss (or a motion for judgment on the pleadings), the complaint must plead facts that raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\"); <i>see also</i> Charles Alan Wright and Arthur R. Miller, 5 <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 1203 (\"[T]he form and sufficiency of a statement of a claim for relief under Rule 8(a)(2) may be tested by a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, Rule 12(b)(6), [or] by a motion for judgment on the pleadings, Rule 12(c)....\").</p>\n<p>[4]  The defendants never filed such a petition.</p>\n<p>[5]  The district court recognized this principle, writing, for example, that \"[t]he production of said evidence might lead to circumstantial evidence in support of Plaintiff's case.\" In support of that conclusion, the court cited our decision in <i>Peguero-Moronta v. Gabriel Santiago,</i> 464 F.3d 29, 45 (1st Cir.2006), for the proposition that \"[a] plaintiff bringing a political discrimination claim bears the burden of producing sufficient direct or <i>circumstantial</i> evidence from which a jury reasonably may infer that [his] constitutionally protected conductin this case, political affiliation ... was a substantial or motivating factor behind [his] dismissal.\" (Emphasis added, other modifications in original.)</p>\n<p>[6]  The district court admonished the defendants for raising this argument so late in the game<i>Twombly</i> had been decided ten months before the defendants moved for re-evaluation of the pleadings in light of that case. Furthermore, <i>Twombly</i> had already been decided when the district court entered the default judgment. Nevertheless, because the district court reached the arguments on the merits, we do as well.</p>\n\n</div>",

In the original appeal, we vacated the district court's dismissal of the case for failure to state a claim, holding that the plaintiffs' complaint adequately pleaded the necessary elements of a political discrimination action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. <i>Ramírez v. Arlequín,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202187\"><a href=\"/opinion/202187/ramirez-v-arlequin/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 25 (1st Cir.2006). Subsequent to our decision, the district court reinstated the claims and eventually entered a default judgment against defendants, the municipality of Guayanilla, Puerto Rico (\"the Municipality\"), and its mayor, Edgardo Arlequín, as a result of repeated discovery violations.</p>\n<p>In this appeal, defendants argue that: 1) the district court abused its discretion in entering the default judgment, and 2) even in light of the default judgment, the plaintiffs cannot prevail because their complaint does not make out a prima facie case of political discrimination. For reasons we shall explain, we conclude that there was no abuse of discretion in the entry of a default judgment, and that the law of the case doctrine bars defendants' attempt to reargue the adequacy of plaintiffs' complaint. We therefore affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Background</h2>\n<p>Although the background facts of this complaint are described in our earlier decision in this case, <i>id.</i> at 20-22, we will recount them here succinctly. Plaintiff Remexcel Managerial Consultants (\"Remexcel\") is a company owned by Reinaldo Ramírez. Remexcel entered into a contract with the former mayor of Guayanilla, Ceferino Pacheco Guidicelli (\"Mayor Pacheco\"), a member of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\"), to perform accounting services for the Municipality that would identify residents who owed taxes. <i>Id.</i> at 20-21. Remexcel was to receive ten percent of the money obtained as a result of its services. When Remexcel identified a tax deficiency of $4,444,058.87 owed to the Municipality by Stinnes Interoil, an oil supply company, the Municipality informed Stinnes of that determination, and Stinnes filed a lawsuit against the Municipality in Puerto Rico Superior Court seeking to dispute any outstanding tax liability. <i>See Veba Oil Supply v. Municipality of Guyanilla,</i> Civ. No. JCO 96-003 (Super.Ct.Ponce).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> Plaintiff María S. Kortright is a lawyer who was hired by Mayor Pacheco and the Municipality to defend that lawsuit under a contingency arrangement which, like the agreement with Remexcel, would pay her ten percent of the money collected as a result of her work. <i>Ramírez,</i> 447 F.3d at 21. Working on the case until 2000, Kortright filed the summary judgment motions which led to a favorable resolution of the case for the Municipality. <i>Id.</i> After she performed this work, however, defendant Edgardo Arlequín (\"Mayor Arlequín\") took office, replacing Mayor Pacheco. Mayor Arlequín is a member of the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\"). <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The complaint alleges that after taking office, Mayor Arlequín began \"a pattern and practice of discrimination by taking adverse action against anyone associated with the prior New Progressive Party administration at any level,\" and, as a result, refused to continue the Municipality's professional association with the plaintiffs. Kortright was replaced as counsel for the <i>Veba Oil</i> case. According to the complaint, \"[t]he new counsel did nothing of record but enter his appearance before the court granted summary judgment for the Municipality in the amount of $4.5 million, based on Kortright's work.\" <i>Id.</i> The new lawyer then settled the suit for $1.8 million to be paid to the Municipality. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging, inter alia, that their First Amendment associational rights were violated because Mayor Arlequín and the Municipality refused to pay them money they were rightfully owed solely because of their association with Mayor Pacheco. Defendants moved in the district court to dismiss the suit for failure to state a claim. The district court granted the motion, concluding that, pursuant to the Supreme Court's decisions in <i>Elrod v. Burns,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109517\"><a href=\"/opinion/109517/elrod-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">427</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">347</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109517\"><a href=\"/opinion/109517/elrod-v-burns/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ruling favorably for the plaintiffs, we concluded that the <i>Elrod/Branti</i> doctrine's exemption of policymakers from protection against political affiliation discrimination does not apply \"to someone who is neither a government employee nor seeks a continuing relationship with the government, but who merely asks to be paid in accordance with a contract which that person has already performed.\" <i>Id.</i> at 23. We wrote that, \"[a]lthough we must always be concerned about constitutionalizing traditional common law claims, we see no theoretical bar to the First Amendment claim that is alleged here.\" <i>Id.</i> We went on to say that \"Remexcel and Kortright must plead that they engaged in protected association, that they were entitled to payment under their contracts, and that the Municipality denied the payment in retaliation for their exercise of associational rights. These elements are adequately pleaded in the complaint.\" <i>Id.</i> at 25 (citation omitted). Hence we reversed the district court's dismissal of Remexcel's and Kortright's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> First Amendment retaliation claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Renewed Proceedings in the District Court</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Defendants' motion for judgment on the pleadings</h2>\n<p>In light of our decision, the district court re-opened the case on June 22, 2006. Approximately two months later, on August 30, 2006, the Municipality filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that \"plaintiffs failed to state a theory of political discrimination that, even with evidentiary support, would constitute a violation of said parties' First Amendment rights.\" <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). Plaintiffs opposed the motion and asked the court to impose sanctions pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1927, because of defendants' unreasonable and vexatious multiplication of proceedings.<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>On December 1, 2006, the district court denied the Municipality's motion for judgment on the pleadings, noting our ruling in the first appeal that the complaint adequately pleaded a First Amendment retaliation claim. It also granted plaintiffs' motion for sanctions because we had already decided that defendants' arguments lacked merit.<sup>[3]</sup> Quoting our decision in <i>Cruz v. Savage,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536974\"><a href=\"/opinion/536974/juan-e-cruz-v-robert-savage-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">896</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">626</span></a></span>, 632 (1st Cir. 1990), it noted that \"[t]his is the type of multiplying of proceedings that § 1927 is designed to avoid.... Counsel for the Municipality acted `in disregard of whether his conduct constitute[d] harassment ... thus displaying a serious and studied disregard for the orderly process of justice.'\" The court went on to say:</p>\n<blockquote>Filing a motion for judgment on the pleadings, based in arguments already rejected by a court of higher level is clearly vexatious conduct that disregards the orderly process of justice and must be sanctioned.... If the Municipality, or its Counsel, disagreed with the First Circuit's decision, it should have filed a [petition for] certiorari before the United States Supreme Court.<sup>[4]</sup></blockquote>\n<p>The district court ordered the defendants to pay $2,000 to the plaintiffs \"in satisfaction of excess costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees they reasonably incurred in relitigating an issues previously ruled on by a higher court.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Discovery violations</h2>\n<p>On September 18, 2006, October 11, 2006, and January 9, 2007, plaintiffs moved to compel the production of requested discovery and for sanctions based on defendants' consistent failure to provide discovery, as well as their alleged failures to appear at scheduled depositions and to respond to a subpoena duces tecum. Defendants opposed the motions, arguing, inter alia, that they had not answered the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> discovery requests because they had objected to them.</p>\n<p>On April 19, 2007, the district court granted plaintiffs' motions to compel and denied their motions for sanctions. Because the response to plaintiffs' motions to compel depended on the merits of defendants' objections to the requests for discovery, the court painstakingly addressed each of defendants' objections. Before compelling the production of any of the objected-to materials, it explained why it disagreed with the defendants that the requested information was either irrelevant or privileged.</p>\n<p>In rejecting plaintiffs' request for sanctions, the court explained that it did not fault the defendants for refusing to produce the objected-to documents until the court had ruled on those objections. It did, however, admonish the defendants for not producing other documents to which it had not objected. It went on:</p>\n<blockquote>We refuse ... to make an account here of each document requested and produced, and those which remain to be produced. Defendants are to make such an exercise and comply with this order by the time provided below.... Should counsel continue to have differences of this sort, the Court will schedule such a conference and will not hesitate to impose sanctions upon the party engaging in professional misconduct, or both parties if the Court finds both responsible.</blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Default Judgment</h2>\n<p>Despite the district court's admonishment, defendants failed to respond to the discovery requests on time. Instead, approximately two weeks after the new deadline for the discovery responses, defendants, according to plaintiffs, \"delivered... a hodgepodge of documents, unnumbered, unidentified, and without any attempt to specify which document related to which request.\" Plaintiffs then asked the court to impose a default judgment as a sanction for defendants' failure to provide responsive discovery. On December 6, 2007, the district court granted that motion.</p>\n<p>Again, the court carefully explained its reasoning. It said that the defendants' failure to respond adequately was \"just the cherry on top of the sundae,\" in light of defendants' many other failures to abide by its orders. It described the troubled history of the discovery process in this case and how it had previously sternly warned defendants that it would issue sanctions for failure to comply with its April 19, 2007 order. The court also listed four separate orders it had issued during the course of the litigation warning defendants that it would issue sanctions if they failed to cooperate with discovery, and also cited its December 1, 2006 order imposing sanctions for defendants' \"vexatious\" and \"stubborn\" conduct.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. The \"Motion to Set Aside Default\"</h2>\n<p>A hearing on damages was set for March 24, 2008. On Easter Sunday, the eve of trial, the Municipality moved in the district court to set aside the default judgment, arguing that the \"recent\" decision of <i>Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">550</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">544</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">929</span></a></span> (2007), mandated that result. In fact, <i>Twombly</i> had been decided in May 2007 ten months before the Municipality's motion \"to set aside default\" and two months before the entry of default judgment. In their motion, defendants once again argued that the complaint did not state a claim for relief. This time, they added the new twist that \"under <i>Twombly,</i> plaintiffs' complaint would never have survived defendants' Rule 12(b)(6) motion.\"</p>\n<p>On March 24, 2008, the district court rejected the \"eleventh hour\" motion as <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> both \"untimely\" and \"without merit.\" The court characterized the motion as a \"misnamed\" motion for reconsideration of the defendants' earlier motion for judgment on the pleadings, because it only argued the sufficiency of the pleadings and did not otherwise argue that the default was an abuse of discretion. The court stated that:</p>\n<blockquote>[U]nder the more stringent <i>Twombly</i> standard, Plaintiffs still plead a cause of action. They argue that they were entitled to some payments under a contract with the Municipality and that the new Mayor, a member of the PDP, refused to pay them only because of Plaintiffs' association with the former Mayor, a member of the NPP.</blockquote>\n<p>Citing our earlier decision in this case, the court remarked that \"said discrimination is exactly what the First Amendment is designed to protect, and therefore, [plaintiffs] have plead enough to show plausible entitlement to relief under the First Amendment.\" After the damages hearing, the court entered judgments of $180,000, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, for both Remexcel and Kortright. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Defendants challenge the imposition of the default judgment as a sanction for their repeated discovery violations.

Tokyo Kikai Seisakusho, Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200515\"><a href=\"/opinion/200515/heidelberg-americas-v-tokyo-kikai/\"><span class=\"volume\">333</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 41 (1st Cir.2003). \"[W]e may reverse a district court only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice, that is, where the lower court's discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\" <i>In re: Subpoena to Witzel,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203374\"><a href=\"/opinion/203374/in-re-subpoena-to-witzel/\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>, 117 (1st Cir.2008) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The court carefully categorized the interrogatories and document requests by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> the type of information sought, and then explained why the information in each category was relevant. For example, for one such category the court explained:</p>\n<blockquote>All of the questions and requests for documents directed to establish the reasons for the terminations or non renewal of Plaintiffs' contract and the persons responsible for or having knowledge of these reasons are clearly relevant to determine whether the termination of their contracts was neutral or discriminatory in nature. Also, all questions that might lead to information about the circumstances surrounding the termination or non renewal of Plaintiffs' contract with the Municipality are relevant as well.</blockquote>\n<p>For another category of requests, the court explained that \"questions related to changes in the Municipality's personnel after Mayor Arlequín took over are relevant to Plaintiffs' allegations that the Mayor engaged in a custom and/or practice of discriminating against all employees and contractors hired or engaged by the prior administration.\" In the end, almost every objection was categorized in this manner and the court's rejection of it explained. The scope of discovery is broad, and \"to be discoverable, information need only appear to be `reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.'\"<sup>[5]</sup><i>Cusumano v. Microsoft Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198247\"><a href=\"/opinion/198247/microsoft-corp-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">708</span></a></span>, 716 n. 5 (1st Cir.1998) (quoting Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(b)(1)).</p>\n<p>The district court was patient, careful, and fair in its choice of sanctions. The court had issued four warnings over the course of the litigation specifically directed at defendants' failures to respond to discovery requests. It had previously issued milder sanctions for defendants' \"vexatious\" behavior. In April 2007, as noted, the court painstakingly addressed each of the objected-to discovery requests and explained why they were relevant, declining to issue sanctions at that time but again warning defendants of the harsh possibilities for failure to respond. Further, it reprimanded defendants at that time for failing to produce documents to which it had not objected, and for objecting to requests for documents that it was automatically obligated to produce \"without awaiting a discovery request\" pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(1). The court's choice of sanctions as well as the sternness of its warnings gradually escalated over the course of the litigation in response to defendants' persistently troublesome conduct. Under these circumstances, the district court did not abuse its discretion by entering a default judgment in response to defendants' repeated failures to respond to discovery. Indeed, its handling of the vexatious discovery conduct was exemplary.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Defendants concede that \"an entry of default prevents the defendant from disputing the truth of well-pleaded facts in the complaint pertaining to liability.\" <i>Conetta v.

They argue, however, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> that they may still contest the sufficiency of the pleadings before them.

Indeed, in describing how <i>Conley</i>'s \"no set of facts\" language has been \"questioned, criticized, and explained away long enough,\" the Supreme Court listed our circuit as an example of the \"judges and commentators [who] have balked at taking the literal terms of the <i>Conley</i> passage as a pleading standard.\" <i>Twombly,</i> 550 U.S. at 562, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145730\"><a href=\"/opinion/145730/bell-atlantic-corp-v-twombly/\"><span class=\"volume\">127</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We accepted the dismissal of Ramírez's claims because he did not contest that ruling. <i>Id.</i> at 22.</p>\n<p>[2]  28 U.S.C. § 1927 reads: \"Any attorney ... who so multiplies the proceedings in any case unreasonably and vexatiously may be required by the court to satisfy personally the excess costs, expenses, and attorneys' fees reasonably incurred because of such conduct.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  The standard for evaluating a motion to dismiss is the same as that for a motion for judgment on the pleadings. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Citibank Global Markets, Inc.,</i> v. <i>Rodríguez Santana, et al.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203914\"><a href=\"/opinion/203914/citibank-global-markets-inc-v-rodriguez-santana/\"><span class=\"volume\">573</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.2009) (\"to survive a motion to dismiss (or a motion for judgment on the pleadings), the complaint must plead facts that raise a right to relief above the speculative level.\"); <i>see also</i> Charles Alan Wright and Arthur R. Miller, 5 <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 1203 (\"[T]he form and sufficiency of a statement of a claim for relief under Rule 8(a)(2) may be tested by a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted, Rule 12(b)(6), [or] by a motion for judgment on the pleadings, Rule 12(c)....\").</p>\n<p>[4]  The defendants never filed such a petition.</p>\n<p>[5]  The district court recognized this principle, writing, for example, that \"[t]he production of said evidence might lead to circumstantial evidence in support of Plaintiff's case.\" In support of that conclusion, the court cited our decision in <i>Peguero-Moronta v. Gabriel Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202457\"><a href=\"/opinion/202457/peguero-moronta-v-gabriel-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2006), for the proposition that \"[a] plaintiff bringing a political discrimination claim bears the burden of producing sufficient direct or <i>circumstantial</i> evidence from which a jury reasonably may infer that [his] constitutionally protected conductin this case, political affiliation ... was a substantial or motivating factor behind [his] dismissal.\" (Emphasis added, other modifications in original.)</p>\n<p>[6]  The district court admonished the defendants for raising this argument so late in the game<i>Twombly</i> had been decided ten months before the defendants moved for re-evaluation of the pleadings in light of that case. Furthermore, <i>Twombly</i> had already been decided when the district court entered the default judgment. Nevertheless, because the district court reached the arguments on the merits, we do as well.</p>\n\n</div>",
