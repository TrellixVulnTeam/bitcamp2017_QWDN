Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                    Boudin, Stahl and Howard,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Carlos M. Sánchez La Costa, by Appointment of the Court, on\nbrief for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, Rosa\nEmilia Rodriguez-Velez, United States Attorney, and Julia M.\nMeconiates, Assistant United States Attorney, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                             July 25, 2011\n\f            STAHL, Circuit Judge.       Defendant-appellant Noel Rosario-\n\nColón pled guilty to aiding and abetting the impersonation of an\n\nofficer of the United States in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 912\n\n(count one), interference with commerce by threats or violence in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. §§ 2 and 1951 (count two), and carriage of\n\na firearm during a crime of violence in violation of 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n2 and 924(c) (count three).          The district court sentenced him to a\n\nterm of twenty-four months' imprisonment to be served consecutively\n\nto an undischarged sentence that he was then serving for a prior\n\ncriminal conviction in case number 06-270 (JAG), which involved\n\nsimilar offenses.        Rosario-Colón appeals on the ground that his\n\ncounsel was ineffective in failing to argue that his term of\n\nimprisonment should run concurrently, rather than consecutively, to\n\nhis undischarged sentence.           We affirm the judgment below without\n\nprejudice     to    Rosario-Colón's     right     to   raise   his   claim   of\n\nineffective assistance of counsel on collateral review because a\n\ncollateral proceeding brought under 28 U.S.C. § 2255, and not a\n\ndirect appeal, is usually the proper vehicle for a claim of\n\nineffective        assistance   of     counsel,    particularly      when    the\n\nevidentiary record is insufficient to evaluate the claim.                    See\n\nUnited States v. García-Pastrana, 584 F.3d 351, 388 (1st Cir. 2009)\n\n(citing United States v. Genao, 281 F.3d 305, 313 (1st Cir. 2002)).\n\n            We recount the facts as stated during the change-of-plea\n\ncolloquy, the plea agreement, and the uncontested portions of the\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fpresentence investigation report. United States v. Ríos-Hernández,\n\n__ F.3d __, No. 09-2545, 2011 WL 2150738, at *1 (1st Cir. June 2,\n\n2011). On May 5, 2006, Rosario-Colón and two co-defendants dressed\n\nin law enforcement tactical uniforms with holstered weapons and,\n\npretending to be federal agents, conducted a traffic stop in Puerto\n\nRico.1   They demanded and obtained $5000 from two Puerto Rican\n\ncitizens under the guise that the money being seized was part of a\n\nfederal money    laundering    investigation.      At   the time   of   the\n\nincident, Rosario-Colón was a sergeant for the Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico Police Department.\n\n          On October 13, 2009, pursuant to a negotiated plea\n\nagreement, Rosario-Colón pled guilty to the three charged offenses.\n\nThe plea agreement provided for a total recommended sentence of 78\n\nmonths based on a sentencing guideline range of 18 - 24 months for\n\ncounts one and two and a statutorily mandated consecutive sentence\n\nof 60 months for count three.     The parties' calculations assumed a\n\nCriminal History Category (\"CHC\") of I, although the agreement did\n\nnot stipulate to a CHC assessment.       The agreement also reserved to\n\nthe parties the right to argue whether the sentence should run\n\nconcurrently or consecutively to the sentence imposed in case\n\nnumber 06-270.\n\n          Before sentencing, the district court ordered the filing\n\n\n\n     1\n      The record does    not    indicate   where   in   Puerto   Rico   the\nincident occurred.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fof simultaneous memoranda of law speaking to: (1) the assignment of\n\ncriminal history points to Rosario-Colón due to his conviction in\n\ncase number 06-270; and (2) whether, in view of the plea agreement,\n\nthe sentence imposed should run concurrently or consecutively to\n\nhis prior, undischarged sentence.              The government submitted a\n\nmemorandum of law that argued for a consecutive sentence, and it\n\nsubsequently     filed     a   supplemental    memorandum   asserting        that\n\nRosario-Colón should be assigned criminal history points. As noted\n\nby the district court when it ordered the government to file the\n\nsupplemental memorandum, counsel for Rosario-Colón showed a \"total\n\ndisregard\"     for   the   court's    order,    having   failed    to   file    a\n\nmemorandum of law that addressed either issue.\n\n          Before the district court ruled, both parties moved to\n\ndismiss count three of the operative indictment, and the court did\n\nso without prejudice.2         Then, after review of the government's two\n\nsubmissions, the district court found that Rosario-Colón's criminal\n\nhistory resulted in 3 criminal history points, a CHC of II, and a\n\nrevised advisory guideline range of 21 - 27 months.               It also held\n\nthat the issuance of a concurrent or a consecutive sentence was\n\nwithin   its    sound      discretion.        Upon   consideration      of    the\n\ngovernment's arguments, the sentencing factors set forth in 18\n\n\n\n     2\n      A report and recommendation issued as to one of Rosario-\nColón's co-defendants precipitated the motions, in which it found\nthat the elements of count three at least partially contradicted\nthe elements of count two, warranting count three's dismissal.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fU.S.C. § 3553(a), and aspects related to the prior, undischarged\n\nsentence, the court found that a fully consecutive sentence was the\n\nmost reasonable punishment.\n\n            Sentencing      followed.          At   the     hearing,     counsel    for\n\nRosario-Colón reminded the court of the dismissal of count three\n\nand    stated   that   he   and   his     client         agreed   on   the    sentence\n\nrecommended by the probation office and government. The government\n\nthen   requested   that     Rosario-Colón           be    sentenced     to   the   full\n\nguideline range of     27 months and that it run consecutively to the\n\nundischarged     sentence.        Upon    consideration           of   the   guideline\n\ncalculations and sentencing factors, the district court sentenced\n\nRosario-Colón to 24 months as to counts one and two, to be served\n\nconcurrently with each other and consecutively with the prior\n\nsentence.\n\n            On appeal, Rosario-Colón raises an ineffective assistance\n\nof counsel claim based on his counsel's failure to argue for a\n\nsentence concurrent with that in case number 06-270 despite the\n\nplea agreement's contemplation of such argument and the district\n\ncourt's order to submit a memorandum on the issue.                     To satisfy the\n\nrequirements of an ineffective assistance claim, a defendant must\n\nshow that: \"(1) counsel's performance fell below an objective\n\nstandard of reasonableness, and (2) the deficient performance\n\nresulted in prejudice to the applicant.\"                   West v. United States,\n\n631 F.3d 563, 567 (1st Cir. 2011) (citing Strickland v. Washington,\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984)).\n\n          Rosario-Colón has not yet presented his claim to the\n\ndistrict court, and, consequently, it is not ripe for review. This\n\ncircuit has \"held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous\n\nthat fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make\n\ntheir debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather,\n\nmust originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial\n\ncourt.\"   United States v. Mala 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir. 1993);\n\nsee also, e.g., United States v. Rivera-Gonzalez, 626 F.3d 639,\n\n644-45 (1st Cir. 2010); United States v. Torres-Oliveras, 583 F.3d\n\n37, 43 (1st Cir. 2009); cf. Massaro v. United States, 538 U.S. 500\n\n(2003) (permitting ineffective assistance claims to be brought in\n\nthe first instance under § 2255).\n\n          To be sure, we have recognized an exception to this rule\n\n\"where the critical facts are not genuinely in dispute and the\n\nrecord is sufficiently developed to allow reasoned consideration of\n\nan ineffective assistance claim.\"     United States v. Natanel, 938\n\nF.2d 302, 309 (1st Cir. 1991); see also United States v. Wyatt, 561\n\nF.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 2009) (noting exception to rule when \"trial\n\ncounsel's ineffectiveness is manifestly apparent from the record\").\n\nDespite Rosario-Colón's urgings, however, this case, does not fall\n\nwithin the exception.   For example, from the record before us we\n\nare left to speculate whether defense counsel's failure to argue\n\nfor a concurrent sentence was a strategic decision in view of the\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fdismissal of count three or, instead, an unintentional oversight.\n\nFurther, we are not properly positioned to analyze whether any\n\nalleged deficiency prejudiced Rosario-Colón.          See Rivera-Gonzalez,\n\n626 F.3d at 645 (\"[I]t is the trial court, rather than the\n\nappellate court, that is in the best position to assess whether\n\ncounsel's    performance,    if    it   was   in    fact    constitutionally\n\ndeficient, resulted in prejudice to the appellant's substantial\n\nrights, as required under Strickland.\" (internal marks omitted)\n\n(quoting United States v. Ofray-Campos, 534 F.3d 1, 34 (1st Cir.\n\n2008))).\n\n            Thus, we affirm the judgment below without prejudice to\n\nRosario-Colón's     right   to    reassert    his   claim   of   ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel in a separate proceeding brought under\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f",
