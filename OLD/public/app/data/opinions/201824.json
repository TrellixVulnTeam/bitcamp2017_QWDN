Johnson, Office of Immigration Litigation, Civil\nDivision, Department of Justice, with whom Peter D. Keisler,\nAssistant Attorney General, Civil Division, and Papu Sandhu, Senior\nLitigation Counsel, were on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                        September 16, 2005\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.         Abdelhafid Zarouite, a citizen of\n\nMorocco, entered the United States without proper documentation in\n\nJune 2000.     Removal proceedings began against him in the same\n\nmonth, 8 U.S.C. §§ 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), (a)(7)(A)(i) (2000), during\n\nwhich he conceded removability but sought asylum on grounds of\n\npersecution.      8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1) (2000); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)\n\n(2005).   The pertinent background events, and the allegations made\n\nby Zarouite, are as follows.\n\n            Zarouite was born and raised in Casablanca, Morocco,\n\nattended university there, and lived in the city until 1996.                   In\n\nthat year--according to Zarouite--he and his parents were forced by\n\nthe Moroccan government to move to the territory of Western Sahara.\n\nMorocco currently occupies much of the area; the remaining parts of\n\nthe   territory      are   apparently    controlled      by   an   independence\n\nmovement, the Polisario Front.                In the 1990s Morocco and the\n\nPolisario    Front    negotiated,   under       United   Nations   auspices,   a\n\npossible referendum to determine the territory's status.\n\n            A dispute existed as to whether all residents would be\n\npermitted to vote in the referendum, or only those (mainly ethnic\n\nSahrawis) who resided in Western Sahara prior to 1975.                 Zarouite\n\nclaimed that he and his parents, of Sahrawi descent, were compelled\n\nto move to Western Sahara in 1996 because the Moroccan government\n\nwanted more votes against independence. Zarouite contends that for\n\nthree years after his arrival in Western Sahara, he suffered\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fbeatings and attacks at the hands of the Polisario Front, which\n\nwanted him to leave.\n\n          In 1999, Zarouite returned to Casablanca where he said he\n\nwas imprisoned by the Moroccan government and given the choice\n\nbetween returning to Western Sahara or remaining in jail.          After\n\nseveral months he returned to Western Sahara where, he says, he\n\nagain suffered harassment from the Polisario Front.       In June 2000\n\nhe left, entered the United States unlawfully through Canada, and\n\nwas apprehended by American authorities.\n\n          After a hearing, the immigration judge denied the request\n\nfor asylum and withholding of removal on the express ground that he\n\ndid not credit Zarouite's testimony as to persecution, many aspects\n\nof which he found improbable.       Some of the immigration judge's\n\nreasoning raises eyebrows (he thought it improbable that the\n\ngovernment    would   remove   a   gainfully   employed   family    from\n\nCasablanca); other doubts might seem better founded (the judge\n\nthought that Zarouite's account of one of the alleged assaults\n\ninvolved an improbable escape from harm).\n\n          Zarouite then sought review by the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (\"BIA\"), which on April 1, 2004, issued a two-paragraph\n\naffirmance.   The BIA said that the immigration judge did not give\n\n\"specific and cogent reasons\" for his credibility finding, that the\n\nBIA therefore \"assume[d]\" Zarouite's credibility, but that \"even\n\nif\" the alleged acts constituted past persecution, \"the record ...\n\n\n                                   -3-\n\freveals fundamental changes in Morocco since [Zarouite's] departure\n\nsuch that his fear of returning is no longer well-founded.\"\n\n          For this last proposition, the BIA cited only a State\n\nDepartment \"country report\" on Morocco dated March 4, 2002.          The\n\nBIA summarized the report by saying that it showed that, despite\n\nsome past abuses, today \"the Moroccan government generally respects\n\nthe rights of its citizens and that Sahrawis who have departed to\n\nMorocco are encouraged to return provided they recognize Morocco's\n\nsovereignty over the Western Sahara.\"      This was the sole support\n\noffered to show that Zarouite's assumed fear was unfounded.\n\n          Although we are aware of the BIA's very large volume of\n\ncases and the difficulties it faces with self-serving stories, the\n\nBIA decision in this case cannot be sustained.        The question in\n\nthis case is relatively narrow.     The BIA concluded that Zarouite\n\nwas not eligible for asylum--whether the Attorney General wishes to\n\ngrant it is a separate matter, Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 758\n\n(1st Cir. 1992)--and Zarouite is entitled to judicial review on the\n\neligibility question.   Id.   The legal framework as to eligibility\n\nis well settled.\n\n          Under the statute and case law, Zarouite had to establish\n\na well-founded fear of future persecution on one or more of five\n\nenumerated grounds (race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nparticular social group, and political opinion).            8 U.S.C. §\n\n1101(a)(42)(A).    Ordinarily,    the   persecution   has   to   involve\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fgovernment actors, although government action exposing him to\n\npersecution by others or refusing to protect him against such\n\npersecution could suffice.   See Harutyunyan v. Gonzales, --- F.3d\n\n---, No. 04-2207, slip op. at 9 (1st Cir. Sept. 2, 2005).1     One\n\nbasis for showing such a well-founded fear (the one pressed by\n\nZarouite) is to show past persecution, which gives rise to a\n\npresumption of future persecution which is sufficient for the\n\napplicant's case unless rebutted by the Attorney General (e.g., by\n\nshowing changed conditions).   8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b); Fergiste v.\n\nINS, 138 F.3d 14, 18 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n          Zarouite's argument in this court for such a showing of\n\npast persecution appears to proceed as follows: the Moroccan\n\ngovernment deported him to Western Sahara because of his ethnic\n\nheritage as a Sahrawi (arguably satisfying the \"social group\"\n\ncriterion of the statute); the deportation has exposed him to\n\nrepeated physical assault and risk of death by the Polisario Front;\n\nthe Moroccan government has been unwilling or unable to protect\n\nhim; and the combined effect is that he is being threatened with\n\nbeatings or worse as a result of action and inaction by the\n\nMoroccan government.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Zarouite's brief claims persecution by both the government\nand the Polisario Front but we need not consider whether the\nlatter's actions standing alone would satisfy Harutyunyan; if the\ngovernment did not compel Zarouite to remain in the contested area,\nany threat to him from the Front would seemingly disappear.\n\n                                -5-\n\f           In its decision, the BIA was content to assume past\n\npersecution     arguendo    and     to   dispose   of    the   case    on    a   quite\n\ndifferent ground, namely, the inference it drew from the country\n\nreport that \"even if\" Zarouite had been persecuted in the past, the\n\nMoroccan government had changed its ways and no fear of repetition\n\ncould be well founded. The State Department's regular country\n\nreports are generally persuasive of country conditions, 3 Gordon,\n\nMailman & Yale-Loehr, Immigration Law and Procedure § 33.04[3][f]\n\n(2005), but are open to contradiction.               Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d\n\n34, 45 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           In this case, says the Attorney General, the substantial\n\nevidence standard applies and the BIA's decision should be upheld\n\nunless the record \"compels\" the opposite result.                   Compare Aguilar-\n\nSolis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir. 1999).                   Admittedly, the\n\nrecord   does    not     \"compel\"    the    conclusion       that     the    Moroccan\n\ngovernment      will   repeat     the    alleged     behavior       that     Zarouite\n\nattributes to it, but the problem here is that the country report\n\ndoes not directly address such behavior at all, so the rationality\n\nof the inference is open to question.\n\n           The    most    pertinent      sentences      in   the    report    are   as\n\nfollows:\n\n           The Government also encouraged the return of\n           Sahrawis who have departed Morocco due to the\n           conflict in the Western Sahara, provided that\n           they recognize the Government's claim to the\n           region. The Government did not permit Western\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f          Saharan nationalists who have been released\n          from prison to live in the disputed territory.\n\n          Zarouite's testimony, if believed, suggests that the\n\nMoroccan government once had a policy of requiring some Moroccans\n\nto move to Western Sahara in order to bolster a vote in Morocco's\n\nfavor in an anticipated referendum. It would hardly make sense for\n\nthe Moroccan government to make one family alone move back.            If\n\nMorocco once had such a policy, abandonment of the policy would\n\ndefeat the basis for Zarouite's claim.         But the quoted language\n\nfrom the country report neither concedes such a policy nor suggests\n\nthat, if it once existed, it has now been discontinued.                See\n\nFergiste, 138 F.3d at 19.\n\n          The BIA paraphrased the report in another, far more\n\ngeneral, respect.    It said that the Moroccan government generally\n\nrespects the rights of its citizens.       Inferences can be drawn from\n\nthe general to the particular; conceivably, a country report could\n\nreflect such a firm present adherence by a government to high\n\nhuman-rights standards, across a range of activities, that forced\n\nrelocation   of    population   for     political   purposes   would    be\n\nimplausible and defeat any well-founded fear of repetition of past\n\nabuses.\n\n          It is enough to say in summary that the country report\n\nsays that the human rights record in Morocco, once discouraging, is\n\nnow improving, but this is far from the kind of blanket endorsement\n\njust posited.     Indeed, a pertinent excerpt from the report reads:\n\n                                  -7-\n\f\"The Government generally respected the rights of citizens in most\n\nareas; however, the Government's record was generally poor in a few\n\nareas.\"   Thus, it is difficult to understand why the BIA thinks\n\nthat the country report makes Zarouite's assumed fear of future\n\nrepetition unreasonable.\n\n          Notably,   the   government's   brief   makes   no   developed\n\nargument to show that the report rebuts Zarouite's fear of future\n\npersecution; it merely asserts this proposition in conclusory terms\n\nand passes on with suspicious swiftness.     Here is the gist of the\n\ndiscussion, stripped of citations to the proposition that country\n\nreports can be invoked:\n\n          Petitioner also weakly challenges the Board's\n          well-founded fear finding, by claiming that\n          the 2001 Country Report, upon which the Board\n          relied, was insufficient.    Pet. Br. at 25.\n          However, the 2001 Country Report, which\n          demonstrated changed country conditions in\n          Morocco and disproved Petitioner's well-\n          founded    fear   of    future    persecution,\n          substantially     supports     the     Board's\n          determination. . . .    [As in another cited\n          case,] Petitioner failed to present \"powerful\n          evidence\" to discount the 2001 Country Report\n          and prove that his fear of future persecution\n          is well-founded.\n\n          Nothing in the brief shows that the country report\n\n\"disproves\" Zarouite's fear, nor does the report itself do so when\n\nread in full.   Thus there was no need for Zarouite to \"discount\"\n\nthe country report since it does not contradict the thrust of his\n\ntestimony.   The inference that the BIA seeks to draw from the\n\nreport is not rational, or if it could be rationally explained, the\n\n                                 -8-\n\fgovernment has failed to do so.    See Ren v. Ashcroft, No. 04-1702,\n\n2005 WL 1950805, at *4 (1st Cir. Aug. 16, 2005).\n\n          Two further matters remain to be noted.   First, Zarouite\n\nalso claims that the BIA failed to consider the possibility that--\n\nregardless of future persecution--it would be inhumane to return\n\nhim to Morocco because his past treatment had been so terrible.\n\nSuch an exception exists for extraordinary suffering, Tokarska v.\n\nINS, 978 F.2d 1, 1-2 (1st Cir. 1992), but it seems quite unlikely\n\nthat Zarouite could qualify and, decisively, he has forfeited any\n\nsuch claim by failing to raise it at the agency level.   Makhoul v.\n\nAshcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          Second, in an effort to undo the BIA's initial decision,\n\nZarouite filed a motion to reopen on June 25, 2004, attaching more\n\nrecent country reports on Morocco and other related documents.   On\n\nAugust 12, 2004, the BIA denied the motion on the ground that the\n\nnew information did not show a significant change in country\n\nconditions from the report relied on by the BIA and that Zarouite\n\ndid not “meet his heavy burden of demonstrating that if the\n\nproceedings were reopened, the evidence would likely change the\n\nresult in this case.”\n\n          Zarouite has sought review of this denial.   His position\n\nis that these materials show a relapse as to human rights on the\n\npart of the Moroccan government, including political repression and\n\nabuses such as torture. Interestingly, the more recent reports are\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fmixed    as   to   government   policy   toward   Western   Sahara.   Some\n\ninformation suggests that Morocco is interested in populating\n\nWestern Sahara with supporters; other information indicates that it\n\nmay no longer be interested in a referendum at all.\n\n              In any event, the original report relied upon by the BIA\n\ndoes not adequately support the BIA's inference so Zarouite's\n\neffort to contradict it with later reports is at present beside the\n\npoint.    If on remand the agency continues to assume arguendo that\n\nZarouite's story is true and to resolve the case based on current\n\ncountry conditions, it will have to update the record and provide\n\na reasoned explanation.         Alternatively, it may choose to follow\n\nsome other course that will make country conditions irrelevant.\n\n              The BIA order of April 1, 2004, is vacated and the matter\n\nremanded for further appropriate proceedings.               So far as the\n\npetition seeks review of the refusal to reopen, it is dismissed as\n\nmoot.\n\n              It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f",

The State Department's regular country reports are generally persuasive of country conditions, 3 Gordon, Mailman &amp; Yale-Loehr, <i>Immigration Law and Procedure</i> &#167; 33.04[3][f] (2005), but are open to contradiction. <i>Gailius v.

It would hardly make sense for the Moroccan government to make one family alone move back. If Morocco once had such a policy, abandonment of the policy would defeat the basis for Zarouite's claim. But the quoted language from the country report neither concedes such a policy nor suggests that, if it once existed, it has now been discontinued. <i>See Fergiste,</i> 138 F.3d at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA paraphrased the report in another, far more general, respect.

Inferences can be drawn from the general to the particular; conceivably, a country report could reflect such a firm present adherence by a government to high human-rights standards, across a range of activities, that forced relocation of population for political purposes would be implausible and defeat any well-founded fear of repetition of past abuses.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is enough to say in summary that the country report says that the human rights record in Morocco, once discouraging, is now improving, but this is far from the kind of blanket endorsement just posited. Indeed, a pertinent excerpt from the report reads: \"The Government generally respected the rights of citizens in most areas; however, the Government's record was generally poor in a few areas.\" Thus, it is difficult to understand why the BIA thinks that the country report makes Zarouite's assumed fear of future repetition unreasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notably, the government's brief makes no developed argument to show that the report rebuts Zarouite's fear of future persecution; it merely asserts this proposition in conclusory terms and passes on with suspicious swiftness.

Pet. Br. at 25. However, the 2001 Country Report, which demonstrated changed country conditions in Morocco and disproved Petitioner's well-founded fear of future persecution, substantially supports the Board's determination. . . .

Thus there was no need for Zarouite to \"discount\" the country report since it does not contradict the thrust of his testimony. The inference that the BIA seeks to draw from the report is not rational, or if it could be rationally explained, the government has failed to do so. <i>See Ren v.

First, Zarouite also claims that the BIA failed to consider the possibility that &#8212; regardless of <i>future</i> persecution &#8212; it would be inhumane to return him to Morocco because his past treatment had been so terrible. Such an exception exists for extraordinary suffering, <i>Tokarska v. INS,</i> 978 F.2d 1, 1-2 (1st Cir.1992), but it seems quite unlikely that Zarouite could qualify and, decisively, he has forfeited any such claim by failing to raise it at the agency level. <i>Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> 387 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, in an effort to undo the BIA's initial decision, Zarouite filed a motion to reopen on June 25, 2004, attaching more recent country reports on Morocco and other related documents. On August 12, 2004, the BIA denied the motion on the ground that the new information did not show a significant change in country conditions from the report relied on by the BIA and that Zarouite did not \"meet his heavy burden of demonstrating that if the proceedings were reopened, the evidence would likely change the result in this case.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zarouite has sought review of this denial. His position is that these materials show a relapse as to human rights on the part of the Moroccan government, including political repression and abuses such as torture. Interestingly, the more recent reports are mixed as to government policy toward Western Sahara. Some information suggests that Morocco is interested in populating Western Sahara with supporters; other information indicates that it may no longer be interested in a referendum at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the original report relied upon by the BIA does not adequately support the BIA's inference so Zarouite's effort to contradict it with later reports is at present beside the point. If on remand the agency continues to assume <i>arguendo</i> that Zarouite's story is true and to resolve the case based on current country conditions, it will have to update the record and provide a reasoned explanation. Alternatively, it may choose to follow some other course that will make country conditions irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA order of April 1, 2004, is vacated and the matter remanded for further appropriate proceedings.

Removal proceedings began against him in the same month, 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1182(a)(6)(A)(i), (a)(7)(A)(i) (2000), during which he conceded removability but sought asylum on grounds of persecution. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(1) (2000); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b) (2005). The pertinent background events, and the allegations made by Zarouite, are as follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zarouite was born and raised in Casablanca, Morocco, attended university there, and lived in the city until 1996. In that year &#8212; according to Zarouite &#8212; he and his parents were forced by the Moroccan government to move to the territory of Western Sahara. Morocco currently occupies much of the area; the remaining parts of the territory are apparently controlled by an independence movement, the Polisario Front. In the 1990s Morocco and the Polisario Front negotiated, under United Nations auspices, a possible referendum to determine the territory's status.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A dispute existed as to whether all residents would be permitted to vote in the referendum, or only those (mainly ethnic Sahrawis) who resided in Western Sahara prior to 1975. Zarouite claimed that he and his parents, of Sahrawi descent, were compelled to move to Western Sahara in 1996 because the Moroccan government wanted more votes against independence. Zarouite contends that for three years after his arrival in Western Sahara, he suffered beatings and attacks at the hands of the Polisario Front, which wanted him to leave.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1999, Zarouite returned to Casablanca where he said he was imprisoned by the Moroccan government and given the choice between returning to Western Sahara or remaining in jail. After several months he returned to Western Sahara where, he says, he again suffered harassment from the Polisario Front. In June 2000 he left, entered the United States unlawfully through Canada, and was apprehended by American authorities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a hearing, the immigration judge denied the request for asylum and withholding of removal on the express ground that he did not credit Zarouite's testimony as to persecution, many aspects of which he found improbable. Some of the immigration judge's reasoning raises eyebrows (he thought it improbable that the government would remove a gainfully employed family from Casablanca); other doubts might seem better founded (the judge thought that Zarouite's account of one of the alleged assaults involved an improbable escape from harm).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Zarouite then sought review by the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\"), which on April 1, 2004, issued a two-paragraph affirmance. The BIA said that the immigration judge did not give \"specific and cogent reasons\" for his credibility finding, that the BIA therefore \"assume[d]\" Zarouite's credibility, but that \"even if\" the alleged acts constituted past persecution, \"the record ... reveals fundamental changes in Morocco since [Zarouite's] departure such that his fear of returning is no longer well-founded.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For this last proposition, the BIA cited only a State Department \"country report\" on Morocco dated March 4, 2002. The BIA summarized the report by saying that it showed that, despite some past abuses, today \"the Moroccan government generally respects the rights of its citizens and that Sahrawis who have departed to Morocco are encouraged to return provided they recognize Morocco's sovereignty over the Western Sahara.\" This was the sole support offered to show that Zarouite's assumed fear was unfounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although we are aware of the BIA's very large volume of cases and the difficulties it faces with self-serving stories, the BIA decision in this case cannot be sustained. The question in this case is relatively narrow. The BIA concluded that Zarouite was not <i>eligible</i> for asylum &#8212; whether the Attorney General wishes to grant it is a separate matter, <i>Ravindran v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592069\"><a href=\"/opinion/592069/valli-kandiah-ravindran-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">754</span></a></span>, 758 (1st Cir.1992) &#8212; and Zarouite is entitled to judicial review on the eligibility question. <i>Id.</i> The legal framework as to eligibility is well settled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the statute and case law, Zarouite had to establish a well-founded fear of future persecution on one or more of five enumerated grounds (race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, and political opinion). 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A).

Some information suggests that Morocco is interested in populating Western Sahara with supporters; other information indicates that it may no longer be interested in a referendum at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the original report relied upon by the BIA does not adequately support the BIA's inference so Zarouite's effort to contradict it with later reports is at present beside the point. If on remand the agency continues to assume <i>arguendo</i> that Zarouite's story is true and to resolve the case based on current country conditions, it will have to update the record and provide a reasoned explanation. Alternatively, it may choose to follow some other course that will make country conditions irrelevant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA order of April 1, 2004, is vacated and the matter remanded for further appropriate proceedings. So far as the petition seeks review of the refusal to reopen, it is dismissed as moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Zarouite's brief claims persecution by both the government and the Polisario Front but we need not consider whether the latter's actions standing alone would satisfy<i>Harutyunyan;</i> if the government did not compel Zarouite to remain in the contested area, any threat to him from the Front would seemingly disappear.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
