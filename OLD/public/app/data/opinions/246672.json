See Brody v. United States, 1 Cir., 1957, 243 F.2d 378, certiorari denied, 1957, 354 U.S. 923, 77 S.Ct. 1384, 1 L.Ed.2d 1438.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court at the initial stages of the proceeding elected not to issue a turn-over direction in the breadth requested by the government.  Instead it chose to exclude from its order the records relating to all tax years with respect to which there were any contentions made by the respondents that the taxing authorities had already completed an audit (the documents in question had been in their previous possession) whether or not the United States at this time admitted that such a prior audit had been made.  The district court also chose to exclude from its enforcement order the records relating to any tax year with respect to which respondents had made the contention that the statute of limitations would apply (unless fraud were found).  In addition, it is to be noted that although the petition for enforcement of the internal revenue summons broadly requested an order for the turn-over of 'stock certificate book' and other unspecified documents of each corporation, the district court elected to strike out these requests from the order which it entered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court expressly reserved jurisdiction of the proceeding, stating that it proposed to issue 'an interim order, for immediate compliance, and leave other aspects of the matter to await further testimony.'</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As thus limited, the 'interim order' of the court directed respondents to produce the records on or before today, Monday, December 8.
