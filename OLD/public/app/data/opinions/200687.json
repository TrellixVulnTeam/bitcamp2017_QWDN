In Puerto Rico, organizations that\n\nseek to be recognized as political parties must gather roughly\n\n100,000 endorsing petitions, each signed by a registered voter and\n\nsworn to before a notary public.     Since only a lawyer can become a\n\nnotary in Puerto Rico, there are fewer than 8,000 notaries in the\n\nentire commonwealth — and notarial services do not come cheap.\n\nChafing under these restrictions, a nascent political party — the\n\nPartido Acción Civil (the Party) — challenged various aspects of\n\nthe law, including the lawyer-notarization requirement, in the\n\nlocal courts.    The Party lost.\n\n             Plaintiff-appellee José Emilio Pérez-Guzmán (Pérez), a\n\nmember of the Party who had not participated in the earlier suit,\n\nremained dissatisfied with the lawyer-notarization requirement. He\n\nsued the members of the Puerto Rico State Elections Commission (the\n\nCommission) in the federal district court.        The district court\n\nrejected a proffered res judicata defense and found that the\n\nlawyer-notarization requirement violated the plaintiff's First\n\nAmendment rights.     Pérez Guzmán v. Gracia, 260 F. Supp. 2d 389\n\n(D.P.R. 2003).     The Commission and the Commonwealth (which had\n\nintervened in the proceedings below) appeal from this ruling.\n\n          The questions raised by these appeals are novel and\n\nimportant.    The res judicata issue involves the extent to which a\n\njudgment against an association can preclude a later action by a\n\nmember of that association.        The constitutional issue pits the\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fgovernment's      interest    in      regulating     elections       against   an\n\nindividual's interests in electoral participation and freedom of\n\nassociation.      Having     worked    our   way   through    both   issues,   we\n\nconclude, as did the district court, that the instant action is not\n\npretermitted by the prior judgment and that the lawyer-notarization\n\nrequirement unduly burdens First Amendment rights.               Consequently,\n\nwe affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           The Party is an unincorporated association seeking to be\n\nregistered by petition as a political party, and Pérez is among its\n\nmembers.   Under commonwealth law, a \"Party by Petition\"\n\n           — Shall be any group of citizens who, desiring\n           to appear on the electoral ballot of a general\n           election, shall register as a political party,\n           on or before June 1 of the election year, by\n           filing with the Commission sworn petitions to\n           such effect, before notary publics duly\n           admitted to the practice of notary, pursuant\n           to the provisions of the Notary Act in effect,\n           who   shall   collect   from   the   Electoral\n           Commission a fee of one (1) dollar for each\n           valid, notarized petition signed by a number\n           of electors of no less than five (5) percent\n           of the total votes cast for all candidates for\n           the office of Governor in the preceding\n           general election.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 16, § 3101(3) (2000).                    Because more than\n\n2,000,000 votes were cast in the 2000 gubernatorial election, a\n\ngroup that currently desires to register a political party must\n\namass in excess of 100,000 notarized petitions. Each petition must\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fbe signed and sworn to before a notary public and filed with the\n\nCommission within seven days after notarization.           Id. § 3102.\n\n           There is nothing wrong with a state demanding that a\n\nwould-be political party demonstrate a \"significant modicum of\n\nsupport\" before gaining access to the ballot,1 Jenness v. Fortson,\n\n403 U.S. 431, 442 (1971), and, thus, petitioning requirements are\n\ncommonplace in such situations.          But Puerto Rico's obviously\n\nburdensome rule — a rule that requires each signature to be\n\nseparately notarized — is quite uncommon.       See, e.g., Am. Party of\n\nTex. v. White, 415 U.S. 767, 775 n.6 (1974) (noting that, under\n\nTexas law, a single notarial certificate \"may be so made as to\n\napply to all [signatories] to whom [the oath] was administered\");\n\nGa. Code Ann. § 21-2-170(d) (Supp. 2002) (providing that each sheet\n\nof a nominating petition must bear the circulator's affidavit\n\npertaining to the voter signatures reflected thereon).               Puerto\n\nRico's rule that only attorneys can serve as notaries, P.R. Laws\n\nAnn. tit. 4, § 2011 (2000), is also rare.        The combination of the\n\ntwo rules is, insofar as we can tell, unique.\n\n           Given this peculiar collocation of circumstances, it is\n\nnot   surprising   that   controversy   has   surrounded    Puerto   Rico's\n\nnotarization requirement.      We reviewed the procedural history of\n\n\n      1\n      Puerto Rico is the functional equivalent of a state for First\nAmendment purposes, see Posadas de P.R. Assocs. v. Tourism Co., 478\nU.S. 328, 331 n.1 (1986) (noting that Puerto Rico is fully subject\nto the First Amendment), and we sometimes refer to Puerto Rico as\nif it were a state notwithstanding its unique commonwealth status.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fthe Party's challenge to it in an earlier opinion, see Cruz v.\n\nMelecio, 204 F.3d 14, 17-18 (1st Cir. 2000), and we briefly\n\nrehearse that history in order to put the appellants' res judicata\n\ndefense into perspective.\n\n            On October 6, 1998, the Party filed an action in the\n\nPuerto Rico Court of First Instance against the Commission and\n\nothers.     Its complaint averred, inter alia, that the lawyer-\n\nnotarization requirement transgressed the Constitution.             The court\n\ngranted summary judgment in favor of the defendants; the Puerto\n\nRico Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judgment; the Puerto Rico\n\nSupreme     Court    also   affirmed,      see   Civil   Action    Party    v.\n\nCommonwealth, 2000 TSPR 29, 2000 WL 223543 (P.R. Feb. 25, 2000)\n\n(CAP I), reconsideration denied per curiam, 2000 TSPR 61, 2000 WL\n\n462276 (P.R. Apr. 25, 2000) (CAP II); and the United States Supreme\n\nCourt denied certiorari, 531 U.S. 920 (2000).\n\n            Just two days before the intermediate appellate court\n\nruled, fourteen Party members filed an action for declaratory and\n\ninjunctive relief in Puerto Rico's federal district court.                 The\n\naction raised essentially the same federal constitutional claims,\n\nincluding    the    claim   that   the   lawyer-notarization      requirement\n\nviolated the plaintiffs' rights to free speech and association, to\n\nparticipate in the political process, to vote, and to enjoy equal\n\nprotection of the laws.       Cruz, 204 F.3d at 17.      The district court\n\ndismissed the action on the merits.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f             An    appeal   ensued.     In   it,   we   first    addressed   the\n\npotential applicability of res judicata.           We held that the defense\n\ndid not apply because the commonwealth court proceedings were, at\n\nthat point, still in progress.          Id. at 20-21.      We then determined\n\nthat the district court had erred in dismissing the action for\n\nfailure to state a potentially viable claim.                Id. at 22.       The\n\ncomplaint had alleged facts which, if true, \"tend[ed] to support\n\nthe appellants' claims that the notarization requirement and seven-\n\nday [filing] deadline unduly burden ballot access.\"                Id.   Thus:\n\n             If . . . the appellants can prove that\n             notarization is prohibitively expensive or\n             otherwise difficult to achieve (as the\n             complaint avers), then the Commission will\n             have to show that the notarization requirement\n             is narrowly drawn to advance a compelling\n             governmental interest. This showing requires\n             the Commission to come forward with proof.\n             Whether it ultimately can succeed in this\n             endeavor is a sufficiently open question that\n             we cannot conclude, on the pleadings, that no\n             set of facts exists under which the appellants\n             might prevail.\n\nId. (footnote and internal citation omitted).                   Accordingly, we\n\nvacated the order of dismissal.\n\n             Still, we did not allow the case to proceed unabated,\n\nbut,     rather,    instructed   the   district    court    to    stay   further\n\nproceedings pending the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision.                Id.\n\nat 25.    Among the factors we found \"highly relevant to the calculus\n\nof abstention\" was our belief that \"the appellants [had] filed the\n\npresent suit in an effort to detour around an unfavorable judgment\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fof the commonwealth trial court.\"             Id. at 24.        After the Puerto\n\nRico Supreme Court affirmed the judgment against the Party and the\n\nUnited States Supreme Court denied certiorari, the district court\n\ndismissed Cruz on res judicata grounds.               The Cruz plaintiffs did\n\nnot appeal, and that appeared to be the end of the matter.\n\n            Appearances can be deceiving. The next year, Pérez filed\n\nthis action challenging the lawyer-notarization requirement (but\n\nnot the seven-day filing requirement).                 In relevant part, the\n\ncomplaint    sought    a   declaration        that    the    lawyer-notarization\n\nrequirement, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 16, § 3101(3), violated Pérez's\n\nrights to freedom of speech and equal protection.                  It also prayed\n\nfor an injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing section\n\n3101(3) and the corresponding regulations.\n\n            After an evidentiary hearing, the district court entered\n\nan order \"declaring the requirement . . . that petitions for new\n\npolitical parties be notarized by a lawyer to be in violation of\n\nthe First Amendment of the Constitution.\"                   Pérez Guzmán, 260 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 394.      The court's determination rested in large part on\n\nthe idiosyncratic       nature    of   Puerto     Rico's     lawyer-notarization\n\nrequirement.     In    that     regard,     the   court     made   three   critical\n\nfindings.    First, it found as a fact that the cost of notarizing\n\n100,000 petitions       would    be    at   least    $1,500,000.      Given   this\n\nsubstantial outlay, the lawyer-notarization requirement imposed a\n\nsevere financial burden upon a citizen's \"right to associate and to\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fform   political     organizations      which   advance   common   goals   and\n\nideals.\"    Id. at 392 (footnote omitted).           Second, the court found\n\nthat the appellants had failed to show that the lawyer-notarization\n\nrequirement    was    narrowly    tailored      to   advance   a   compelling\n\ngovernmental interest.       Id. at 393.        In making this point, the\n\ncourt emphasized that in other electoral contexts the Commission\n\nhad authorized ordinary voters to verify signatures despite the\n\nfact that they were not notaries, but had refused to sanction any\n\ncomparable arrangement for witnessing party-registration petitions.\n\nId. at 391, 393.        There was no evidence that lawyer-notaries\n\nperform this attestation function better than authorized ad hoc\n\nnotaries.     Id. at 393.        Finally, the court found that other\n\nexisting    safeguards,    such    as     the   Commission's   practice    of\n\nindependently verifying each petition submitted to it, adequately\n\nprotect Puerto Rico's legitimate interest in the integrity of its\n\nelectoral processes.      Id. at 390, 393.\n\n            In a separate (unpublished) order, the court rejected the\n\nasserted res judicata defense.          The court found no privity between\n\nPérez and the Party because the record did not show that Pérez had\n\nin any way participated in or controlled the Party's case. Indeed,\n\nthe court found \"no evidence\" that Pérez was even a Party member\n\nduring the currency of the earlier litigation.\n\n            Following the entry of a judgment declaring section\n\n3101(3) unconstitutional, these timely appeals eventuated.             In an\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fabundance of caution, we stayed the execution of the judgment and\n\nexpedited appellate review.      We now confront the substance of the\n\nappeals.    Because the res judicata defense, if successful, would\n\nend our inquiry, we start there.\n\nII.   RES JUDICATA\n\n           The   applicability   of   the   doctrine   of   res   judicata\n\npresents a question of law over which we exercise plenary review.\n\nSee Gonzalez v. Banco Cent. Corp., 27 F.3d 751, 755 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).     Inasmuch as we are called upon here to determine the\n\npreclusive effect of a judgment entered by the commonwealth courts,\n\nPuerto Rico law supplies the rule of decision.          Kremer v. Chem.\n\nConstr. Corp., 456 U.S. 461, 466 (1982); Cruz, 204 F.3d at 18-19.\n\n           In Puerto Rico, the doctrine of res judicata is embedded\n\nin the Civil Code:\n\n           In order that the presumption of the res\n           adjudicata may be valid in another suit, it is\n           necessary that, between the case decided by\n           the sentence and that in which the same is\n           invoked, there be the most perfect identity\n           between the things, causes, and persons of the\n           litigants, and their capacity as such.\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, § 3343 (1990).      The issue here involves the\n\nidentity of the parties in the two actions.            We know that the\n\nrequirement of \"perfect identity\" cannot be taken literally; mere\n\nnominal differences will not undermine the preclusive effect of an\n\nearlier judgment.    Cruz, 204 F.3d at 19.    Hence, parties who are in\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\fprivity with each other are considered identical for res judicata\n\npurposes.    Banco Cent., 27 F.3d at 756-57.\n\n            In Cruz, we determined that privity existed between the\n\nplaintiffs     and   the   Party     (the   plaintiff   in   the   original\n\ncommonwealth court action), stating:\n\n            Although the present appellants are not named\n            parties in the commonwealth court proceedings,\n            they are members of the organization that is\n            the plaintiff there and they control that\n            litigation. This type of privity suffices for\n            res judicata purposes.\n\n204 F.3d at 19.      This determination depended on a combination of\n\ntwo factors:     the plaintiffs were members of the Party and they\n\ncontrolled its conduct of the litigation.         In turn, the finding of\n\ncontrol derived from the Cruz plaintiffs' admissions. They made no\n\nbones about the fact that they were the prime movers behind the\n\nParty's case, \"vigorously assert[ing] that they were denied a full\n\nand fair opportunity to litigate their federal claims in the\n\ncommonwealth proceedings.\"         Id. (emphasis supplied).    Because the\n\nCruz plaintiffs claimed ownership of the Party's case, we held them\n\nto the natural consequences of that claim.\n\n            Before us, the appellants engage in a largely didactic\n\nexercise, asserting that Cruz stands for the proposition that any\n\nmember of a political party has control over litigation brought by\n\nthat party (and, therefore, that the party is in privity with every\n\none of   its members).       But this assertion rests on a porous\n\nfoundation — the notion that Cruz means something other than what\n\n                                     -10-\n\fit says.   We reject that notion.       Cruz required proof of control as\n\na building block in the showing of privity, and without such proof\n\nthere would have been no privity in the circumstances of that case.\n\n           This action is at a considerable remove. Unlike the Cruz\n\nplaintiffs, Pérez steadfastly disclaims any exercise of control\n\nover the original case.            In the absence of an admission, the\n\nappellants, as the proponents of the res judicata defense, have the\n\nburden of establishing a factual basis for that defense.                Banco\n\nCent., 27 F.3d at 759.        But they have not adduced any evidence\n\nsufficient    to   carry   their    burden   (indeed,   they   have   made   no\n\ndiscernible effort to do so).         They have shown only that Pérez's\n\nattorney also represented the Party — and that is not a sufficient\n\npredicate for an inference of control. See id. (noting that courts\n\nregularly \"have refused to find substantial control merely because\n\na nonparty retained the attorney who represented a party to the\n\nearlier action\").     The district court's finding that Pérez did not\n\ncontrol the prior litigation is, therefore, inexpugnable.\n\n             The appellants' first fallback argument is that, even\n\nabsent control, Pérez's membership in the Party, his commonality of\n\ninterests with the Party and its other members, and his desire to\n\nregister the Party combine to establish privity as a matter of law.\n\nThe Party, so this argument goes, is in privity with every one of\n\nits members because it sued to advance their associational rights.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\fTo a person, the members stood to gain if the Party had prevailed;\n\nthus, all of them should be bound by the Party's loss.\n\n           This argument is misguided.          Concepts of privity do not\n\ngrow more expansive when a political party or its members raise\n\nFirst Amendment claims.       After all, the fact that First Amendment\n\nrights are at stake ought to weigh against, not for, a finding of\n\npreclusion.      Cf. Richards v. Jefferson County, 517 U.S. 793, 797\n\n(1996) (noting that \"extreme applications of the doctrine of res\n\njudicata   may    be   inconsistent     with   a    federal     right   that    is\n\n'fundamental in character'\") (quoting Postal Teleg. Cable Co. v.\n\nNewport, 247 U.S. 464, 476 (1918)); Williams v. Rhodes, 393 U.S.\n\n23, 30-31 (1968) (acknowledging that First Amendment rights \"rank\n\namong our most precious freedoms\").\n\n           At any rate, the question of whether an individual should\n\nbe bound by an association's actions in a prior suit is distinct\n\nfrom whether, in practice, the right at issue has an associational\n\ncomponent.        As   we   explained    in    Cruz,     \"[i]ndividuals      have\n\nconstitutionally       protected   interests       in   free   association     and\n\nelectoral participation, including the formation of new political\n\nparties.\" 204 F.3d at 22 (emphasis supplied). Joining a political\n\nparty is an exercise of associational rights, but forging such a\n\nlink does not automatically consign the defense of those rights to\n\nthe party.       Although political parties may \"derive rights from\n\ntheir members,\" FEC v. Colo. Repub. Fed. Campaign Comm., 533 U.S.\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f431, 448 n.10 (2001), the members' own rights are not automatically\n\nsubsumed in a judgment against the party.2\n\n               This might have been a closer case if the appellants had\n\nproven that the Party, in the manner, say, of certain labor unions\n\nor trade associations, served generally as the duly constituted\n\nrepresentative         of   its   members   in   litigation     affecting   common\n\ninterests.          See, e.g., Gen. Foods Corp. v. Mass. Dep't of Pub.\n\nHealth, 648 F.2d 784, 787-88 (1st Cir. 1981); see generally 18A\n\nCharles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Federal\n\nPractice and Procedure:            Jurisdiction 2d § 4456, at 502 (2002)\n\n(citing cases).        But the record here is bereft of anything showing\n\nthat       either    political    parties   in   general   or    this   Party   in\n\nparticular are invested with authority to represent members.                    In\n\nthe absence of any evidence anent the Party's charter, bylaws, or\n\nmembership terms, there is simply no basis for a finding that Pérez\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      In this regard, we note that Pérez's complaint emphasizes his\npersonal right to circulate and verify party petitions.          By\ncontrast, the Party's complaint focused upon \"associational,\nspeech, and voting rights under the ballot access doctrine.\" CAP\nI, Off. Trans. at 2. The two theories do not perfectly coincide,\nand their divergence serves as a reminder that there may be subtle\nconflicts of interest between an association and its individual\nmembers. It is for precisely such reasons that the commentators\nurge \"great care . . . before binding all members to an association\nloss.\"   18A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller & Edward H.\nCooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction 2d § 4456, at\n507-10 (2002).\n\n                                        -13-\n\fever authorized the Party, expressly or by fair implication, to sue\n\non his behalf.3\n\n           This lack of authorization is especially significant\n\nbecause the Party is a jural entity entitled to sue in its own\n\nright.   Unlike the trade association in General Foods, 648 F.2d at\n\n787, its standing to challenge the lawyer-notarization requirement\n\ndid not \"depend[] on [any] claim to represent its members as the\n\nreal parties in interest.\"    And unlike the trade association in\n\nExpert Electric, Inc. v. Levine, 554 F.2d 1227, 1229 (2d Cir.\n\n1977), the Party was not \"established to jointly represent its\n\n[members]\" in all phases of a particular activity.    Without such\n\nindicia, mere membership cannot allow the Party's actions to bind\n\nPérez.    See Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 61(2) (1982)\n\n(noting that if an unincorporated association is a jural entity\n\ndistinct from its members, a judgment against the association binds\n\nits members only to the same extent as a judgment against a\n\n\n\n     3\n      The record is unclear about when Pérez himself joined the\nParty. If the district court is correct that the appellants failed\nto prove his membership in the Party during the key phases of the\noriginal litigation, it is hard to see how he could be bound by the\nearlier adjudication.   Cf. Montalvo-Huertas v. Rivera-Cruz, 885\nF.2d 971, 974-75 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding that since \"the\n[plaintiff] firm had not been formed when the [prior] judgment\neventuated,\" there was \"no predicate for a founded claim that\n[plaintiff] was a party in interest or a controlling force in the\n[prior] litigation\"). We need not test that finding, however, for\neven if Pérez's membership dates back to a time when the original\nlitigation was velivolant, the result here would be unaffected.\nMere membership in a political party, in and of itself, is not\nenough to demonstrate control over the party's affairs.\n\n                                -14-\n\fcorporation binds its shareholders); id. § 59 (explaining that,\n\nwith exceptions not relevant here, a judgment in an action in which\n\na corporation is a party does not bind corporate shareholders).\n\n           From what we have said, it should be evident that the\n\ncommonality of First Amendment interests between a political party\n\nand its members is not itself enough to support a finding of\n\nprivity.   See Griffin v. Burns, 570 F.2d 1065, 1071 (1st Cir. 1978)\n\n(explaining, in a case involving First Amendment rights, that\n\n\"[m]ere similarity of interest and a quantum of representation in\n\nthe earlier suit do[] not suffice to bar a non-party\").           Without\n\nevidence   of   either   control   or   authorization,   the   appellants'\n\nproposition is untenable.\n\n           The appellants next argue for a determination of privity\n\nbased on the doctrine of virtual representation — a term that is\n\nused as a synonym for \"de facto representation\" based on an\n\nidentity of interests between a party to the earlier suit and a\n\nnonparty, Banco Cent., 27 F.3d at 758 n.5.        That possibility need\n\nnot occupy us for long.        The appellants did not rely on this\n\ndoctrine below and, accordingly, they have forfeited the right to\n\nraise it in this venue.     See, e.g., Teamsters Union, Local No. 59\n\nv. Superline Transp. Co., 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"If any\n\nprinciple is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most\n\nextraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in\n\nthe lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\");\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fClauson v. Smith, 823 F.2d 660, 666 (1st Cir. 1987) (holding that\n\nnew legal theories \"cannot be surfaced for the first time on\n\nappeal\").\n\n              Even absent this procedural default, the argument would\n\nbe unavailing.           The record here is barren of any evidence that\n\nwould support a finding of virtual representation.                      In particular,\n\nthere    is   no    proof    that    either      Pérez   or    the   Party,    in   the\n\ninstitution of this action, were engaged in \"tactical maneuvering\n\ndesigned unfairly to exploit technical nonparty status in order to\n\nobtain multiple bites of the litigatory apple.\"                      Banco Cent., 27\n\nF.3d at 761.        Given this dearth of evidence, we cannot find that\n\nthe Party represented Pérez, virtually or otherwise, in maintaining\n\nthe earlier action.\n\n              The authorities relied upon by the appellants in support\n\nof their various res judicata theories are inapposite here.                         We\n\nbriefly discuss the two principal decisions.4\n\n              In Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council v. Tahoe Regional\n\nPlanning Agency, 322 F.3d 1064 (9th Cir. 2003), the plaintiff\n\nassociation        was    formed    for   the     avowed      purpose    of   actively\n\nrepresenting the interests of its individual members before various\n\n\n     4\n      The other cases cited by the appellants are so plainly\ndistinguishable as not to warrant discussion. See, e.g., In re\nColonial Mortg. Bankers Corp., 324 F.3d 12 (1st Cir. 2003); Doe v.\nUrohealth Sys., Inc., 216 F.3d 157 (1st Cir. 2000); Studio Art\nTheatre v. City of Evansville, 76 F.3d 128 (7th Cir. 1996). The\ndiscussion in Snyder v. Munro, 721 P.2d 962 (Wash. 1986), is dictum\nand, in all events, unhelpful.\n\n                                          -16-\n\fregulatory agencies and had the authority to bring claims on behalf\n\nof its members.    Id. at 1083.   On that basis, the court concluded,\n\nwith liberal use of adverbs, that \"the Association represented the\n\ninterests of its member property owners sufficiently thoroughly to\n\nbind other members alleging similar wrongs arising from the same\n\nset of facts.\"    Id. (footnote omitted).   The factors that the Tahoe\n\ncourt found significant, such as association for the express\n\npurpose of litigation and authorization of representation, are\n\ntotally absent here.\n\n          So too Tyus v. Schoemehl, 93 F.3d 449 (8th Cir. 1996), in\n\nwhich the aldermen-plaintiffs filed a second action while the first\n\nwas pending, \"simply adding new plaintiffs.\"        Id. at 457.   The\n\ncourt found unmistakable evidence of \"tactical maneuvering\" such\n\nthat not applying preclusion would have \"allow[ed] various members\n\nof a coordinated group to bring separate lawsuits in the hope that\n\none member of the group would eventually be successful, benefiting\n\nthe entire group.\"    Id.   As we have observed, however, there is no\n\nevidence that Pérez is part of a coordinated strategy to circumvent\n\na prior judgment. The appellants simply have not proven collusion.\n\n          With the facts and the law arrayed against them, the\n\nappellants shift their emphasis to policy grounds.       They contend\n\nthat a rule of blanket preclusion is necessary to promote finality\n\nand forestall manipulative practices, including claim-splitting,\n\nforum-shopping, and serial litigation. But we are skeptical of the\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fvalue    of   a    mechanical      rule,    and   there       is   no    sign    that    any\n\nmanipulation occurred in this case.               The appellants have not shown\n\nthat Pérez is a puppet dancing on a string pulled by the Party or\n\nthat the Party has orchestrated a strategy of serial attacks on the\n\nlawyer-notarization requirement.                In lieu of proof, the appellants\n\napparently would have us infer guilt by association.                           We will not\n\ndo so.\n\n              Relatedly, the appellants predict disaster if blanket\n\npreclusion is rejected. They insinuate that members of a political\n\nparty would have no incentive to join a pending action, for they\n\nwould benefit if the party won but would be free to litigate the\n\npoint if the party lost.            Endless litigation would be the norm.\n\n              This prediction is much too gloomy.                  For one thing, it\n\noverlooks the salutary effect of the doctrine of stare decisis on\n\nrepetitive litigation.             Perhaps more important, it overlooks the\n\nprinciple      that    \"[t]he      law   does     not    impose     upon       any   person\n\nabsolutely        entitled    to     a   hearing        the   burden      of     voluntary\n\nintervention in a suit to which he is a stranger.\"                             Chase Nat'l\n\nBank v. Norwalk, 291 U.S. 431, 441 (1934); accord Martin v. Wilks,\n\n490 U.S. 755, 763 (1989) (reaffirming that \"a party seeking a\n\njudgment      binding    on   another      cannot       obligate        that    person    to\n\nintervene;        he   must   be    joined\").           Finally,        the    appellants'\n\nprediction proves too much: many others also stood to benefit from\n\nthe Party's litigation (for example, other aspiring political\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\fparties and their members) — yet no one is sanguine enough to\n\nsuggest that they too should be bound by its defeat.          So long as we\n\nretain our historic tradition that each person is entitled to his\n\nown day in court, we cannot extend preclusion to nonparties merely\n\nbecause they have failed to seize an opportunity to intervene in a\n\nprior action.\n\n           That ends this aspect of the matter.          As we have said,\n\nPuerto Rico law supplies the rule of decision as to the efficacy of\n\nthe res judicata defense in this case.          The appellants have not\n\npersuaded us that the Puerto Rico courts would find privity in\n\nthese circumstances.     See, e.g., Montalvo-Huertas v. Rivera-Cruz,\n\n885 F.2d 971, 975 (1st Cir. 1989) (holding, under Puerto Rico law,\n\nthat a corporation was not in privity with the plaintiff class in\n\na prior action challenging the same business regulation merely\n\nbecause   the   two   sets   of   plaintiffs   enjoyed   a   \"community   of\n\ninterest\"); Pol Sella v. Lugo Christian, 107 P.R. Dec. 540, 549\n\n(1978) (explaining that res judicata applies when the same person\n\nis the real party in interest vis-à-vis both suits); Heirs of Zayas\n\nBerrios v. Berrios, 90 P.R.R. 537, 552 (1964) (finding identity of\n\nparties where defendants in second case \"actually controlled\" the\n\nfirst case); cf. A & P Gen. Contractors, Inc. v. Associación Caná,\n\nInc., 110 P.R. Dec. 753, 10 P.R. Off. Trans. 987, 994-95 (1981)\n\n(reiterating that Puerto Rico has not \"abandoned the rule of . . .\n\nidentity\" with respect to res judicata).             In the absence of\n\n\n                                    -19-\n\fprivity, it necessarily follows that the district court did not err\n\nin refusing to honor the res judicata defense.5\n\nIII.       THE MERITS\n\n               This   brings   us    to   the    heart    of     the    matter:   the\n\ninteraction between the lawyer-notarization requirement and the\n\nFirst Amendment.        We review de novo the trial court's elucidation\n\nof First Amendment standards and its application of those standards\n\nto the discerned facts.             Globe Newsp. Co. v. Beacon Hill Arch'l\n\nComm'n, 100 F.3d 175, 181 (1st Cir. 1996); Kassel v. Gannett Co.,\n\n875 F.2d 935, 937 (1st Cir. 1989).                   This protocol is not a\n\nprocedural device, but, rather, \"a rule of federal constitutional\n\nlaw\" reflecting \"a deeply held conviction that judges . . . must\n\nexercise such review in order to preserve the precious liberties\n\nestablished and ordained by the Constitution.\"                          Bose Corp. v.\n\nConsumers Union of U.S., Inc., 466 U.S. 485, 510-11 (1984).\n\n              Like    any   other    citizen,    Pérez     has    \"constitutionally\n\nprotected       interests      in      free      association           and   electoral\n\nparticipation, including the formation of new political parties.\"\n\nCruz, 204 F.3d at 22 (collecting cases).                 Although these interests\n\nare important, they are not absolute.               Fair, honest, and orderly\n\n\n       5\n      What we have written to this point fully disposes of the\nappellants' reliance on the so-called Rooker-Feldman doctrine. See\nDist. of Columbia Court of Appeals v. Feldman, 460 U.S. 462, 476\n(1983); Rooker v. Fidelity Trust Co., 263 U.S. 413, 415-16 (1923).\nAfter all, \"[o]nly a state court adjudication that itself has\npreclusive effect can bring the Rooker-Feldman doctrine into play.\"\nCruz, 204 F.3d at 21 n.5.\n\n                                          -20-\n\felections do not just happen.     Substantial state regulation is a\n\nprophylactic that keeps the democratic process from disintegrating\n\ninto chaos.    Consequently, there is a strong state interest in\n\nregulating all phases of the electoral process, including ballot\n\naccess.   Storer v. Brown, 415 U.S. 724, 730 (1974); Libertarian\n\nParty of Me. v. Diamond, 992 F.2d 365, 370 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           We do not mean to minimize the schizophrenic nature of\n\nelection campaigns, which are as much a means of disseminating\n\nideas as a means of attaining political objectives. See Ill. State\n\nBd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party, 440 U.S. 173, 186\n\n(1979).   Given this duality, an overly stringent regulatory scheme\n\nmay place an intolerably heavy burden on freedom of political\n\nexpression.   See id.   In the last analysis, a fine line separates\n\npermissible   regulation    of   state   election   processes   from\n\nimpermissible abridgement of First Amendment rights.\n\n           Plotting that line calls for a careful reconciliation of\n\ncompeting centrifugal and centripetal forces.   The rigorousness of\n\nthe ensuing judicial inquiry depends upon the extent to which the\n\nchallenged regulation burdens First Amendment rights.    Burdick v.\n\nTakushi, 504 U.S. 428, 434 (1992); Werme v. Merrill, 84 F.3d 479,\n\n483 (1st Cir. 1996).       Following this prescription, we afford\n\nexacting scrutiny to severe restrictions on ballot access.      Cruz,\n\n204 F.3d at 22. That entails viewing such restrictions skeptically\n\nand requiring that they be drawn narrowly to advance compelling\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fstate interests.      Norman v. Reed, 502 U.S. 279, 289 (1992).                  To\n\nthis end, we start with an assessment of the severity of the\n\nrestriction.   We then proceed to identify the interests that the\n\nappellants believe justify its imposition, weigh the efficacy of\n\nthe   available     alternatives,      and    decide      where    the   lawyer-\n\nnotarization   requirement     falls    along    the     constitutional    line.\n\nTimmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party, 520 U.S. 351, 358 (1997).\n\n          We approach the question of severity by looking first at\n\nits   theoretical     underpinnings.          Traditionally,       the   act     of\n\ncirculating    a    petition   has     been     viewed     as     \"a   one-on-one\n\ncommunication.\"      Buckley v. Am. Const. Law Found., 525 U.S. 182,\n\n199 (1999).6       One person circulates the petition, obtains the\n\nvoter's signature, and verifies the origins of the signature. See,\n\ne.g., Frami v. Ponto, 255 F. Supp. 2d 962, 965 (W.D. Wis. 2003).\n\nIn Puerto Rico, however, each of the 100,000 petitions must be\n\nsigned singly and sworn in the presence of a lawyer-notary.                    This\n\nrequirement triangulates the normal channels of communication.\n\nAssuming that the circulator is not himself a notary, there must\n\nnow be one person to initiate the conversation, a second to\n\nrespond, and a third to verify that response.\n\n\n\n\n      6\n      We see no principled basis for distinguishing party-petition\nsignature gatherers from the initiative-petition circulators in\nBuckley. The common denominator is that \"both seek ballot access.\"\n525 U.S. at 191.\n\n                                     -22-\n\f          This    triangulation    limits    the   efficacy   of    petition\n\ncirculators in their own right.           No matter how persuasive a\n\ncirculator might be in a face-to-face conversation, he cannot seal\n\nthe deal then and there.     The final exchange in the interactive\n\ncommunication — the voter's official endorsement of the fledgling\n\nparty — cannot occur unless and until a notary is present.               The\n\nhistoric role of the circulator is necessarily diminished.\n\n          In this case, Pérez plainly labored under this heavy\n\nyoke.   He   testified   without    contradiction     that    the    lawyer-\n\nnotarization requirement greatly hampered his efforts to gather\n\nsignatures because, in addition to convincing voters that a new\n\npolitical party was needed, he also had to convince them to repair\n\nto an attorney's office.    When he tried to recruit others to help\n\nin the circulation of petitions, those whom he could interest were\n\n\"just common people,\" not notaries.         The district court credited\n\nthis testimony.\n\n          The stringency of the restriction is aggravated because\n\nthe indispensable third person in the triangulated relationship —\n\nthe notary — may prove hard to find.        In most jurisdictions, it is\n\nneither impractical nor burdensome for party members to become\n\nnotaries so that they may verify the petitions that they circulate.\n\nSee Am. Party of Tex., 415 U.S. at 787.               But Puerto Rico's\n\nrestriction of notarial status to licensed attorneys erects a high\n\nbarrier to entry and virtually ensures that the supply of notaries\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fwill remain inelastic notwithstanding voters' attempts to mount\n\nnew-party registration drives.\n\n            Nor    is   this    a    purely    theoretical     difficulty.         The\n\ndistrict court found that Puerto Rico has only 8,000 lawyer-\n\nnotaries, more or less.         See Pérez Guzmán, 260 F. Supp. 2d at 391.\n\nHence, the ratio of notaries to voters is quite small, and common\n\nsense suggests that there may be areas of the island where lawyers\n\n(and, thus, notaries) are in short supply.                   Even in areas where\n\nnotaries are plentiful, someone must travel; either the voter must\n\nvisit the notary's office or the notary must take to the field.\n\n            Last   —    but    far   from     least    —   someone   must    pay   the\n\nfreight.7   The district court determined that the average cost for\n\nnotarizing a simple document signed at a lawyer's office is between\n\n$15-$20; the cost if the lawyer travels to the site of the signing\n\nescalates to $50-$60; those who would form a party by petition need\n\nto collect a minimum of 100,000 signatures; and, accordingly, the\n\nlawyer-notarization requirement adds at least $1,500,000 to the\n\ncost of a successful petition drive.                  Id. at 391-92.        The court\n\nfurther found that this was \"an unreasonably high price tag for an\n\n\n\n     7\n      To be sure, the Commonwealth pays notaries a dollar for each\nnotarized petition that the Commission accepts as valid, P.R. Laws\nAnn. tit. 16, § 3101(3), and \"sworn statements given on electoral\nmatters,\" including registration petitions, are exempt from the\nusual tax, id. § 3028; Regulation for the Registration of Parties\nby Petition, § 3.2 (Jan. 23, 2002).      The fact of the matter,\nhowever, is that these mild palliatives do not come close to\noffsetting the high cost of notarization.\n\n                                        -24-\n\findividual who is seeking to exercise his constitutional rights.\"\n\nId. at 392 (footnote omitted).\n\n           These findings are wholly supportable.8          Indeed, the\n\ncourt's cost estimates may be conservative because, as a practical\n\nmatter, a group attempting to form a party by petition will need to\n\ngather a surplus of signatures (as challenges likely will result in\n\na number of invalidations).      The court's findings make manifest\n\nthat the task of registering a new political party is one of\n\ndaunting   proportions.   We   hold,    therefore,   that   the   lawyer-\n\nnotarization requirement imposes a severe restriction on Pérez's\n\nability to register a new political party, and, in turn, on his\n\nright to access the ballot.\n\n           The appellants' only direct rejoinder is to remind us\n\nthat the Puerto Rican Renewal Party (PRRP) managed to register for\n\nthe 1984 election as a party by petition.      But no other party has\n\n\n     8\n      The appellants hypothesize that notaries may be willing to\nverify petitions en masse at a flat fee, thus reducing overall\ncosts. The only evidentiary support for this hypothesis is the\ntestimony of a single attorney who acknowledged that he might be\nwilling to notarize up to 500 signatures per month — in his office\n— for $1,000 per month. See Pérez Guzmán, 260 F. Supp. 2d at 392\nn.23.   But the suggestion was ringed with conditions, and the\nprospect of a political proselytizer rounding up squads of voters\nand persuading them to troop to a law office seems remote. At any\nrate, the district court found that the cost of such an arrangement\nwould still be prohibitive and discounted its feasibility. See id.\nThe record offers no basis for setting aside these findings.\n     In much the same vein, it is not a satisfactory answer to say\nthat Pérez can recruit notaries who will volunteer their services.\nHis experience has been to the contrary, and the record contains no\nevidence that attorneys routinely work for free or that fledgling\nparties can consistently attract lawyers to their cause.\n\n                                 -25-\n\fduplicated that feat in the quarter-century since section 3101(3)\n\nwas enacted, see CAP I, Off. Trans. at 9, so this is hardly an\n\nindication that the lawyer-notarization requirement is a piece of\n\ncake.     Cf.      Storer,   415   U.S.    at   742   (noting    evidentiary\n\nsignificance of a showing that particular types of aspirants have\n\n\"qualified [for the general ballot] with some regularity\").                The\n\nPRRP example demonstrates, at most, that the lawyer-notarization\n\nrequirement is not insuperable — not that the requirement is less\n\nthan severe.      It follows that such a showing does not foreclose\n\nPérez's suit. See, e.g., Anderson v. Celebrezze, 460 U.S. 780, 791\n\nn.12 (1983) (explaining that the ability of a few individuals to\n\nqualify as independent presidential candidates \"d[id] not negate\n\nthe burden imposed\" by the challenged regulation); cf. Am. Party of\n\nTex., 415 U.S. at 783 (explaining that what is demanded as a\n\ncondition to ballot access \"may not be so excessive or impractical\n\nas to be in reality a mere device to always, or almost always,\n\nexclude   parties    with    significant    support    from     the   ballot\")\n\n(emphasis supplied).\n\n           Apart from this glancing reference to the PRRP's success,\n\nthe appellants do not seriously dispute the severe impact of the\n\nlawyer-notarization requirement.      Instead, they attempt to confess\n\nand avoid.      Their effort tracks three main avenues.\n\n           First, the appellants propose that a reviewing court\n\nshould afford Puerto Rico wide latitude vis-à-vis the challenged\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fregulation because the Supreme Court, in American Party of Texas\n\nand Jenness, upheld other notarization and petitioning requirements\n\nas reasonable. This proposition overlooks the fact that both cases\n\nwere decided before the Supreme Court crystallized its current\n\nstandard of inquiry in cases such as Burdick, 504 U.S. at 434.\n\nMore   important,      it    overlooks     the   salient    differences     that\n\ndistinguish those two cases from the case at bar.                    We explain\n\nbriefly.\n\n            Although the Court sanctioned a notarization requirement\n\nin American Party of Texas, it gave no indication that Texas\n\nlimited notarial status to members of the bar.                   Moreover, the\n\nrelevant    numerical       threshold    was   one    percent   of   the   active\n\nelectorate — not five percent — and bulk notarization seems to have\n\nbeen available.       415 U.S. at 775 n.6.       The Georgia law at issue in\n\nJenness    required    signatures       from   five   percent   of   the   active\n\nelectorate but imposed no concomitant notarization requirement with\n\nrespect to individual voters' signatures.              403 U.S. at 439.\n\n            These differences make it clear that the appellants are\n\ncomparing plums to pomegranates:           whereas American Party of Texas\n\ndealt with a claim that a garden-variety notarization requirement\n\nconstituted a severe restriction and Jenness dealt with a claim\n\nthat a petitioning requirement constituted a severe restriction,\n\nthe case before us turns on the synergy among three discrete\n\nfactors:    the five percent numerical requirement; the requirement\n\n\n                                        -27-\n\fthat each signature be individually notarized; and the restriction\n\nof notarial practice in Puerto Rico to lawyers.           It is this synergy\n\nthat places section 3101(3) beyond the pale, for it transforms the\n\ndynamics of participation in the electoral process.\n\n            The    appellants'   second    avenue   for   marginalizing   the\n\nseverity of the imposed restriction involves drawing a distinction\n\nbetween the act of seeking support from the voter (which anyone can\n\ndo at any time and place) and the act of authenticating the voter's\n\nsignature.        The appellants argue that the lawyer-notarization\n\nrequirement comes into play only after the voter has agreed to\n\nsubscribe a petition and, thus, does not have First Amendment\n\nimplications. The requirement merely \"regulate[s] the mechanics of\n\nthe   electoral      process,\"   not   \"the    communicative     aspect    of\n\npetitioning.\"      CAP II, Off. Trans. at 7.\n\n            This distinction is artificial.         Petition circulators —\n\npersons like Pérez — are free only in theory \"to convey their\n\npolitical message through whatever means they may deem convenient.\"\n\nId.   The notarization requirement's looming presence forces the\n\ncirculator to structure his communications and choose his target\n\naudiences with that requirement in mind. Pérez, like most persons,\n\nis not a notary.      In principle, he is free to go from door to door\n\nsoliciting support for the Party, but in practice his rate of\n\nreturn will suffer because he cannot gather endorsing signatures on\n\nthe spot.    The record makes clear not only that some voters who\n\n\n                                    -28-\n\fwould be willing to sign petitions are not willing to venture to a\n\nlaw office but also that Pérez faces enormous difficulties in\n\npersuading notaries to accompany him in search of prospects. Given\n\nthe reality of events, the lawyer-notarization requirement burdens\n\npetitioning by causing the utility of a communication to vary with\n\nits setting and with the qualifications of the circulator.\n\n             It would serve no useful purpose to dwell upon this line\n\nof argument.      The short of it is that a state cannot separate\n\npetitioning into two steps, close off the second step to all but a\n\ntiny professional class, and then ignore the effects of that\n\nrestriction.      See Buckley, 525 U.S. at 194-95 (invalidating a\n\nregistration requirement that unduly \"limi[ts] the number of voices\n\nwho will convey [the proponent's] message\" (quoting Meyer v. Grant,\n\n486 U.S. 414, 422-23 (1988)); Lerman v. Bd. of Elections in the\n\nCity of N.Y., 232 F.3d 135, 146 (2d Cir. 2000) (invalidating a\n\nresidency requirement for petition verifiers because it drastically\n\nreduced the number of potential circulators); Krislov v. Rednour,\n\n226 F.3d 851, 860 (7th Cir. 2000) (invalidating a requirement that\n\na   circulator/certifier    be   registered   to   vote   in   particular\n\npolitical subdivisions because it \"preclude[s] the candidate from\n\nutilizing a large class of potential solicitors to convey his\n\nmessage\").     Accordingly, the attempted distinction fails.\n\n           The appellants' third avenue relies upon a \"causation\"\n\nargument which, if credited, would make it unnecessary for us to\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\freach the question of severity.              Under this rubric, they note that\n\nPérez collected a total of fewer than 80 signatures (only 19 of\n\nwhich were actually presented to the Commission).                   Based on this\n\n\"meager\" effort, they fault the district court for failing to\n\naddress the issue of whether Pérez had made a diligent effort to\n\nobtain the requisite number of petitions.                   In their view, the\n\nabsence of due diligence should bar any claim that the lawyer-\n\nnotarization requirement \"caused\" Pérez's inability to register the\n\nParty.\n\n             The appellants derive this due diligence condition from\n\na misreading of Storer.         In that case, the Supreme Court remanded\n\nfor   further   factfinding         as   to   whether,     \"in    the    context    of\n\nCalifornia    politics    .    .    .    a   reasonably    diligent      independent\n\ncandidate     [could]    be        expected     to    satisfy      the     signature\n\nrequirements\" imposed by a state statute regulating the filing of\n\nnomination papers by independent candidates.                     415 U.S. at 742.\n\nContrary to the appellants' importunings, this language did not\n\nportend that only those who demonstrate due diligence can mount a\n\nFirst Amendment challenge to a ballot access requirement.                          The\n\nStorer   remand   went    to       the   burdensomeness      of   the    challenged\n\nregulation    (i.e.,    its    severity),       not   to   causation.       While   a\n\nparticular plaintiff's \"[p]ast experience\" can have evidentiary\n\nsignificance in an assessment of severity, id., a showing of\n\npersonal due diligence is not an element of a ballot access claim,\n\n\n                                         -30-\n\fsee, e.g., Norman, 502 U.S. at 293 (holding that a state may not\n\n\"require petitioners to gather twice as many signatures to field\n\ncandidates in [a multidistrict subdivision] as they would need\n\nstatewide\" without inquiring whether petitioners had shown due\n\ndiligence   in    trying   to   satisfy     the    challenged   requirement);\n\nAnderson, 460 U.S. at 802-04 (discussing challenge without asking\n\nwhether the petitioner had shown due diligence in attempting to\n\nmeet Ohio's early filing deadline).           Indeed, a rule such as that\n\nespoused by the appellants would tend to inoculate even the most\n\nblatantly unconstitutional electoral requirements from legitimate\n\nattack.9\n\n            That ends this phase of our analysis.               We conclude,\n\nwithout serious question, that Puerto Rico's lawyer-notarization\n\nrequirement imposes a severe burden on Pérez's rights.\n\n            We   turn   next    to   the    task    of   \"identify[ing]   and\n\nevaluat[ing] the precise interests put forward by the State as\n\njustifications for the burden imposed by its rule.\"             Anderson, 460\n\nU.S. at 789.     In the course of that inquiry, we must determine the\n\n\n\n     9\n      We recognize that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court gave the\nParty \"an opportunity to show the steps it had taken with regard to\nits registration process.\" CAP II, Off. Trans. at 2. In its own\nstatement of the ballot access doctrine, however, the court\nrecognized that the test of burdensomeness was \"whether it would be\npossible for a reasonably diligent candidate to satisfy the State's\nrequirements,\" not whether the Party had been reasonably diligent.\nCAP I, Off. Trans. at 12.     To the extent that the Puerto Rico\nSupreme Court would treat due diligence as a prerequisite for\nstating a ballot access claim, we respectfully disagree.\n\n                                     -31-\n\flegitimacy and strength of each of those interests as well as the\n\nextent to which they dictate burdening citizens' rights.    Id.\n\n          We do not gainsay Puerto Rico's robust interest in\n\nprotecting the integrity of its election processes.    See Timmons,\n\n520 U.S. at 364; Am. Party of Tex., 415 U.S. at 782 n.14.     This\n\nincludes an \"important state interest in requiring some preliminary\n\nshowing of a significant modicum of support before printing the\n\nname of a political organization's candidate on the ballot.\"\n\nJenness, 403 U.S. at 442.   That interest is directly served by the\n\nfive percent petitioning requirement.    See Lubin v. Panish, 415\n\nU.S. 709, 718 (1974) (terming a signature requirement the \"obvious\"\n\nmeans of testing a candidate's level of support).     The conundrum\n\nhere involves an additional safeguard — the lawyer-notarization\n\nrequirement — and the interests it advances.\n\n          The appellants have identified only one such interest:\n\npreventing election fraud.      They assert that notarization is\n\nnecessary to \"remed[y] a type of electoral fraud that the Puerto\n\nRico Legislature found to ha[ve] been pervasive.\"       Appellants'\n\nReply Br. at 39.     The Puerto Rico Supreme Court echoed this\n\nsentiment.   It declared that notarization \"serves a compelling\n\nstate interest in guaranteeing the integrity of the electoral\n\nprocess, given the history of electoral fraud and corruption\n\nexperienced in Puerto Rico.\"   CAP I, Off. Trans. at 15.   In this\n\n\n\n\n                                -32-\n\fregard,   the    court   singled   out    \"[t]he    popular   practice   of\n\nmanipulating the voting lists.\"      Id.\n\n           Even though we accept the legitimacy of this interest, we\n\nmust nonetheless mull the extent to which that interest renders it\n\nnecessary to burden Pérez's rights so severely.          See Anderson, 460\n\nU.S. at 789.       The question of whether the lawyer-notarization\n\nrequirement is narrowly fashioned to advance the identified state\n\ninterest boils down to whether notarization by a lawyer is more\n\nlikely to reduce fraud by any or all of the participants in the\n\ntransaction than other available (less restrictive) alternatives.\n\nWe examine this question from a variety of perspectives.\n\n           As to the voter, the appellants contend that notarization\n\ngives   some    meaningful   assurance    that   voters'   signatures    are\n\nauthentic. \"The [voter] takes oath to that fact and experience has\n\nshown that many people take their oaths seriously.\"            Libertarian\n\nParty of Va. v. Davis, 591 F. Supp. 1561, 1564 (E.D. Va. 1984),\n\naff'd, 766 F.2d 865 (4th Cir. 1985).               But this contention is\n\ndisingenuous, for it is the oath that guarantees honesty — not the\n\npedigree of the oath-giver.        The appellants do not suggest that\n\npeople take oaths less seriously in jurisdictions where notaries\n\nneed not be lawyers or in jurisdictions where affirmations are\n\ntaken by non-notary witnesses.       The idea that notarization by a\n\nlawyer will significantly reduce voter fraud is utterly unsupported\n\nby the record; there is nothing to show that a voter bent on\n\n\n                                   -33-\n\fcommitting petition fraud will be less brazen in front of a lawyer-\n\nnotary than in front of some other type of witness.10\n\n          We turn next to petition circulators.      The appellants\n\noffer no developed argumentation to the effect that notarization by\n\na lawyer will discourage circulator fraud.    We assume that this is\n\na concession.   See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st\n\nCir. 1990) (holding that points raised on appeal in a perfunctory\n\nfashion, without developed argumentation, are conceded).     In any\n\nevent, the district court effectively scotched any such notion,\n\nobserving that \"[a] lawyer will notarize a signature merely by\n\nverifying the signatory's identification,\" and that \"[t]here is no\n\nreason to believe that attorneys who happen to be notaries are\n\nsomehow more adept than non-lawyers at reading and verifying\"\n\nidentification documents.   Pérez Guzmán, 260 F. Supp. 2d at 393.\n\n          This leaves the notary himself.    The Puerto Rico Supreme\n\nCourt suggested that the lawyer-notarization requirement \"allows\n\nfor the imposition of sanctions for any illegal act committed by\n\nthe person before whom the petition is sworn to.\"       CAP I, Off.\n\nTrans. at 14 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). But\n\nthis rationale does not itself distinguish the lawyer-notary from\n\nany other person who may be authorized by the Commission to verify\n\n\n     10\n      The appellants have not argued that the formal incidents of\nnotarization, such as the application of the notarial seal or the\nspecial status that notaries may enjoy under Puerto Rico law, carry\nspecial weight with voters or otherwise influence voters' decisions\nabout whether to obey the law.\n\n                               -34-\n\fpetitions.      One need be neither a lawyer nor a notary to be fined\n\nor imprisoned for participating in the preparation of fraudulent\n\ndocuments.      See, e.g., P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33, § 4437 (2001).11\n\n           We     recognize   that   \"notarial   practice   is   strictly\n\nregulated\" in Puerto Rico; that notaries are \"the only officers\n\nvested by the [Puerto Rico] Supreme Court with the authority to\n\nguarantee . . . the authenticity of the documents executed before\n\nthem\"; and that \"[t]he intervention of a notary establishes a\n\npresumption of veracity in all the documents authenticated by him\n\nor her.\"   CAP I, Off. Trans. at 15 (citation omitted).      But without\n\nsome proof that lawyer-notarization is appreciably more effective\n\nat preventing petition fraud than non-lawyer verification — and the\n\nrecord contains none — all of this is beside the point.          The fact\n\nthat a state's asserted interest in preventing electoral fraud is\n\nimportant in the abstract does not create a presumption that its\n\nchosen means of regulation will advance that interest. See Lerman,\n\n232 F.3d at 149.\n\n             In a related vein, the appellants contend that the\n\nlawyer-notarization requirement is necessary because a successful\n\n\n     11\n      We are aware that the Puerto Rico Supreme Court stated that\n\"penal statutes enacted to prevent electoral fraud have proved\nineffective.\"   CAP I, Off. Trans. at 16 n.11 (citing P.S.P. v.\nRomero Barceló, 110 D.P.R. 248 [10 P.R. Off. Trans. 315] (1980)).\nHowever, the very decision the court cites upheld a contested\nprovision in part because \"the mechanisms provided by law to avoid\nfraud in the coming election\" were sufficient to allay fears that\nthe election might be vitiated by fraudulent votes. 10 P.R. Off.\nTrans. at 329-30.\n\n                                     -35-\n\fpetition effort stands to reap a munificent harvest for the Party\n\n— at least $600,000 from the Electoral Fund in an election year,\n\n$300,000 in a non-election year, and \"insider\" status for the next\n\nfour years.    See CAP I, Off. Trans. at 9 (noting that \"registered\n\nparties . . . share in the Electoral Fund\"); CAP II, Off. Trans. at\n\n9 (explaining that registration also allows a party to \"become a\n\npart of the government body that governs the electoral process, as\n\na result of which it acquires quasi-public functions\").              These\n\nfacts simply reinforce a proposition to which we already have\n\nsubscribed, namely, that the state has a compelling interest in\n\npreventing    the   fraudulent   registration    of   political   parties.\n\nAccess to special privileges says nothing about the effectiveness\n\nof lawyer-notarization as a means of advancing that interest.\n\n          In considering whether a ballot access requirement is\n\nnarrowly drawn to advance the state's interest in preventing fraud,\n\nthe mechanisms that the state already has in place serve as\n\nbenchmarks.    Norman, 502 U.S. at 294.         We think it noteworthy,\n\ntherefore, that the Commission routinely allows the use of ad hoc\n\nnotaries for a wide variety of analogous purposes, e.g., \"for a\n\nperson registering to vote, a voter changing his electoral address,\n\npetitioners seeking to have an independent candidate placed on the\n\nballot, and petitions nominating candidates for primaries.\"          Pérez\n\n\n\n\n                                   -36-\n\fGuzmán, 260 F. Supp. 2d at 391.12 In addition, ad hoc notaries were\n\nauthorized for use in the 1998 commonwealth-wide status plebiscite.\n\nSee CAP I, Off. Trans. at 9.     The record contains not one hint of\n\nelection fraud or administrative error committed by, or under the\n\nauspices of, ad hoc notaries.    Absent some evidence that the use of\n\nad hoc notaries correlates with a higher incidence of corruption or\n\nunreliability, we cannot accept the Commission's ipse dixit that it\n\nneeds to insist on the use of lawyer-notaries in the new-party\n\npetition context. See Werme, 84 F.3d at 485 (explaining that \"mere\n\nsuspicion or paranoia is too flimsy a foundation on which to rest\n\na claim of incipient fraud or mistake\").\n\n          Referring back to a political party's access to the\n\nElectoral Fund and its opportunity to participate as an \"insider\"\n\nin the electoral system for a four-year period, the appellants\n\nposit that registration as a political party entails higher stakes\n\nthan other matters (and, hence, that the use of ad hoc notaries in\n\nthat context would be especially risky). By this logic, parties by\n\npetition are not situated similarly to independent candidates,\n\ncandidates for major party primaries, or even groups participating\n\nin the plebiscite process.      We think that this vastly overstates\n\n\n\n     12\n       According to the Secretary of the Commission, candidates or\ngroups that wish to use ad hoc notaries must give the Commission a\nlist of functionaries who are willing to act in that capacity.\nThese functionaries need not be lawyers; any bona fide voter may so\nserve. The Commission then appoints ad hoc notaries from these\nlists.\n\n                                 -37-\n\fthe   matter;    it    is    not    obvious   to     us    that,      say,    the    status\n\nplebiscite was less important to the future of Puerto Rico than the\n\nregistration of a new political party.                     We need not pursue this\n\npoint,    however,     because       the   appellants       have      not    shown     that,\n\ncompared with verification by ad hoc notaries, lawyer-notarization\n\nis superior in detecting and deterring petition fraud.\n\n             We add, moreover, that the use of ad hoc notaries is not\n\nthe only feasible safeguard available to the Commission (indeed,\n\nthe record strongly suggests that notarization may not even be the\n\nbest means currently employed by the Commission).                          The Commission\n\nchecks every petition to ensure that the signature is valid. Pérez\n\nGuzmán,   260    F.    Supp.    2d    at   390.      It    is    in    the    process    of\n\ncomputerizing        its    voter    registration        records      to    include    each\n\nregistered      voter's      signature.           This    project      is     slated    for\n\ncompletion later this year, and its completion will enhance the\n\nCommission's ability to verify petitions.                        To accomplish these\n\ntasks, the Commission has at its disposal a cadre of people not\n\naffiliated with any political party.                     These nonpartisan workers\n\ncomprise the so-called Validations Unit, a unit that has the\n\nassignment      of    checking       petitions       one    by     one       against     the\n\nCommission's records.          The Secretary of the Commission, in answer\n\nto a query from the district court, testified that \"it would not be\n\n\n\n\n                                           -38-\n\fdifficult for the Commission to check [new-party] petitions . . .\n\nagainst [its] records.\"13\n\n            In this specialized electoral context, the Commission's\n\nin-house verification procedure compares favorably with lawyer-\n\nnotarization. As the district court found, a lawyer-notary usually\n\nverifies a signature by checking a driver's license, a passport, or\n\nsome other identification document.            Pérez Guzmán, 260 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 391. There is no indication that notaries compare signatures to\n\nthose appearing on voting records or take steps to ensure that\n\naffiants are registered voters.              The Commission, it appears, is\n\nbetter positioned than a notary to detect the species of fraud that\n\npurportedly justifies the lawyer-notarization requirement. See CAP\n\nI, Off. Trans. at 15 (offering as a justification the need to\n\nferret    out   the    \"popular   practice     of   manipulating   the   voting\n\nlists\").\n\n            Let us be perfectly clear.          A state is entitled to take\n\na   \"belt-and-suspenders\"         approach    and   put   in   place   multiple\n\nmechanisms for ensuring the integrity of its electoral processes.\n\nHere, however, the record fails to show that lawyer-notarization\n\nadds anything over and above other readily available means of\n\nverification.         Based in part on the absence of evidence that\n\n\n     13\n      This may represent a changed circumstance.      During the\ncurrency of the Party's case, the commonwealth courts found that\nthe Commission \"d[id] not have enough officers to examine the\nlegitimacy of the new parties' endorsement collection process.\"\nCAP I, Off. Trans. at 15.\n\n                                      -39-\n\flawyer-notarization reduces electoral fraud and in part on the\n\narray of less restrictive alternatives available to the state\n\n(including the feasibility of using non-lawyers as ad hoc notaries\n\nand the Commission's apparent ability to verify every petition in-\n\nhouse), we find the lawyer-notarization requirement broader than\n\nnecessary to serve the state's asserted interest.          Consequently,\n\nthe requirement embodied in section 3101(3) cannot survive a First\n\nAmendment challenge.    See Norman, 502 U.S. at 293-94; Krislov, 226\n\nF.3d at 866; Cruz, 204 F.3d at 22.\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further.      For the foregoing reasons, we\n\nhold (1) that res judicata does not bar the maintenance of the\n\ninstant action, and (2) that the lawyer-notarization requirement is\n\nnot narrowly drawn to advance a compelling state interest (and,\n\nthus, cannot withstand First Amendment scrutiny).         We are mindful\n\nthat our constitutional conclusion differs from that of the Puerto\n\nRico Supreme Court, and we do not lightly part company with so\n\ndistinguished   a   tribunal.   But    it   is   our   responsibility   to\n\ninterpret and apply the Constitution of the United States, and it\n\nwould be a dereliction of that duty to defer to the views of any\n\nstate court.\n\n           The judgment of the district court is affirmed and the\n\nstay previously issued is dissolved.\n\n\n\n\n                                -40-\n\f",

Since only a lawyer can become a notary in Puerto Rico, there are fewer than 8,000 notaries in the entire commonwealth &#8212; and notarial services do not come cheap. Chafing under these restrictions, a nascent political party &#8212; the Partido Acci&#243;n Civil (the Party) &#8212; challenged various aspects of the law, including the lawyer-notarization requirement, in the local courts. The Party lost.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-appellee Jos&#233; Emilio P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n (P&#233;rez), a member of the Party who had not participated in the earlier suit, remained dissatisfied with the lawyer-notarization requirement. He sued the members of the Puerto Rico State Elections Commission (the Commission) in the federal district court. The district court rejected a proffered res judicata defense and found that the lawyer-notarization requirement violated the plaintiff's First Amendment rights. <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n v. Gracia,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d 389 (D.P.R.2003). The Commission and the Commonwealth (which had intervened in the proceedings below) appeal from this ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The questions raised by these appeals are novel and important. The res judicata issue involves the extent to which a judgment against an association can preclude a later action by a member of that association. The constitutional issue pits the government's interest in regulating elections against an individual's interests in electoral participation and freedom of association. Having worked our way through both issues, we conclude, as did the district court, that the instant action is not pretermitted by the prior judgment and that the lawyer-notarization requirement unduly burdens First Amendment rights. Consequently, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Party is an unincorporated association seeking to be registered by petition as a political party, and P&#233;rez is among its members. Under commonwealth law, a \"Party by Petition\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&#8212; Shall be any group of citizens who, desiring to appear on the electoral ballot of a general election, shall register as a political party, on or before June 1 of the election year, by filing with the Commission sworn petitions to such effect, before notary publics duly admitted to the practice of notary, pursuant to the provisions of the Notary Act in effect, who shall collect from the Electoral Commission a fee of one (1) dollar for each valid, notarized petition signed by a number of electors of no less than five (5) percent of the total votes cast for all candidates for the office of Governor in the preceding general election.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 16, &#167; 3101(3) (2000). Because more than 2,000,000 votes were cast in the 2000 gubernatorial election, a group that currently desires to register a political party must amass in excess of 100,000 notarized petitions. Each petition must be signed and sworn to before a notary public and filed with the Commission within seven days after notarization. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3102.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is nothing wrong with a state demanding that a would-be political party demonstrate a \"significant modicum of support\" before gaining access to the ballot,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Jenness v. Fortson,</i> 403 U.S. 431, 442, 91 S.Ct. 1970, 29 L.Ed.2d 554 (1971), and, thus, petitioning requirements are commonplace in such situations. But Puerto Rico's obviously burdensome rule &#8212; a rule that requires each signature to be separately notarized &#8212; is quite uncommon. <i>See, e.g., Am. Party of Tex. v. White,</i> 415 U.S. 767, 775 n. 6, 94 S.Ct. 1296, 39 L.Ed.2d 744 (1974) (noting that, under Texas law, a single notarial certificate \"may be so made as to apply to all [signatories] to whom [the oath] was administered\"); Ga.Code Ann. &#167; 21-2-170(d) (Supp.2002) (providing that each sheet of a nominating petition must bear the circulator's affidavit pertaining to the voter signatures reflected thereon). Puerto Rico's rule that only attorneys can serve as notaries, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 4, &#167; 2011 (2000), is also rare. The combination of the two rules is, insofar as we can tell, unique.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given this peculiar collocation of circumstances, it is not surprising that controversy has surrounded Puerto Rico's notarization requirement. We reviewed the procedural history of the Party's challenge to it in an earlier opinion, <i>see Cruz v. Melecio,</i> 204 F.3d 14, 17-18 (1st Cir.2000), and we briefly rehearse that history in order to put the appellants' res judicata defense into perspective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 6, 1998, the Party filed an action in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance against the Commission and others. Its complaint averred, inter alia, that the lawyer-notarization requirement transgressed the Constitution. The court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants; the Puerto Rico Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the judgment; the Puerto Rico Supreme Court also affirmed, <i>see Civil Action Party v. Commonwealth,</i> 2000 TSPR 29, 2000 WL 223543 (P.R. Feb.25, 2000) (<i>CAP I</i>), <i>reconsideration denied per curiam,</i> 2000 TSPR 61, 2000 WL 462276 (P.R. Apr.25, 2000) (<i>CAP II</i>); and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari, 531 U.S. 920, 121 S.Ct. 283, 148 L.Ed.2d 204 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just two days before the intermediate appellate court ruled, fourteen Party members filed an action for declaratory and injunctive relief in Puerto Rico's federal district court. The action raised essentially the same federal constitutional claims, including the claim that the lawyer-notarization requirement violated the plaintiffs' rights to free speech and association, to participate in the political process, to vote, and to enjoy equal protection of the laws. Cruz, 204 F.3d at 17. The district court dismissed the action on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appeal ensued. In it, we first addressed the potential applicability of res judicata. We held that the defense did not apply because the commonwealth court proceedings were, at that point, still in progress. <i>Id.</i> at 20-21. We then determined that the district court had erred in dismissing the action for failure to state a potentially viable claim. <i>Id.</i> at 22. The complaint had alleged facts which, if true, \"tend[ed] to support the appellants' claims that the notarization requirement and seven-day [filing] deadline unduly burden ballot access.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If ... the appellants can prove that notarization is prohibitively expensive or otherwise difficult to achieve (as the complaint avers), then the Commission will have to show that the notarization requirement is narrowly drawn to advance a compelling governmental interest. This showing requires the Commission to come forward with proof. Whether it ultimately can succeed in this endeavor is a sufficiently open question that we cannot conclude, <i>on the pleadings,</i> that no set of facts exists under which the appellants might prevail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (footnote and internal citation omitted). Accordingly, we vacated the order of dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, we did not allow the case to proceed unabated, but, rather, instructed the district court to stay further proceedings pending the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision. <i>Id.</i> at 25. Among the factors we found \"highly relevant to the calculus of abstention\" was our belief that \"the appellants [had] filed the present suit in an effort to detour around an unfavorable judgment of the commonwealth trial court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 24. After the Puerto Rico Supreme Court affirmed the judgment against the Party and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari, the district court dismissed Cruz on res judicata grounds. The Cruz plaintiffs did not appeal, and that appeared to be the end of the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appearances can be deceiving. The next year, P&#233;rez filed this action challenging the lawyer-notarization requirement (but not the seven-day filing requirement). In relevant part, the complaint sought a declaration that the lawyer-notarization requirement, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 16, &#167; 3101(3), violated P&#233;rez's rights to freedom of speech and equal protection. It also prayed for an injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing section 3101(3) and the corresponding regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an evidentiary hearing, the district court entered an order \"declaring the requirement... that petitions for new political parties be notarized by a lawyer to be in violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution.\" <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 394. The court's determination rested in large part on the idiosyncratic nature of Puerto Rico's lawyer-notarization requirement. In that regard, the court made three critical findings. First, it found as a fact that the cost of notarizing 100,000 petitions would be at least $1,500,000. Given this substantial outlay, the lawyer-notarization requirement imposed a severe financial burden upon a citizen's \"right to associate and to form political organizations which advance common goals and ideals.\" <i>Id.</i> at 392 (footnote omitted). Second, the court found that the appellants had failed to show that the lawyer-notarization requirement was narrowly tailored to advance a compelling governmental interest. <i>Id.</i> at 393. In making this point, the court emphasized that in other electoral contexts the Commission had authorized ordinary voters to verify signatures despite the fact that they were not notaries, but had refused to sanction any comparable arrangement for witnessing party-registration petitions. <i>Id.</i> at 391, 393. There was no evidence that lawyer-notaries perform this attestation function better than authorized ad hoc notaries. <i>Id.</i> at 393. Finally, the court found that other existing safeguards, such as the Commission's practice of independently verifying each petition submitted to it, adequately protect Puerto Rico's legitimate interest in the integrity of its electoral processes. <i>Id.</i> at 390, 393.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a separate (unpublished) order, the court rejected the asserted res judicata defense. The court found no privity between P&#233;rez and the Party because the record did not show that P&#233;rez had in any way participated in or controlled the Party's case. Indeed, the court found \"no evidence\" that P&#233;rez was even a Party member during the currency of the earlier litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the entry of a judgment declaring section 3101(3) unconstitutional, these timely appeals eventuated. In an abundance of caution, we stayed the execution of the judgment and expedited appellate review. We now confront the substance of the appeals. Because the res judicata defense, if successful, would end our inquiry, we start there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. RES JUDICATA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The applicability of the doctrine of res judicata presents a question of law over which we exercise plenary review. <i>See Gonzalez v. Banco Cent. Corp.,</i> 27 F.3d 751, 755 (1st Cir.1994). Inasmuch as we are called upon here to determine the preclusive effect of a judgment entered by the commonwealth courts, Puerto Rico law supplies the rule of decision. <i>Kremer v. Chem. Constr. Corp.,</i> 456 U.S. 461, 466, 102 S.Ct. 1883, 72 L.Ed.2d 262 (1982); Cruz, 204 F.3d at 18-19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Puerto Rico, the doctrine of res judicata is embedded in the Civil Code:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order that the presumption of the res adjudicata may be valid in another suit, it is necessary that, between the case decided by the sentence and that in which the same is invoked, there be the most perfect identity between the things, causes, and persons of the litigants, and their capacity as such.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 3343 (1990). The issue here involves the identity of the parties in the two actions. We know that the requirement of \"perfect identity\" cannot be taken literally; mere nominal differences will not undermine the preclusive effect of an earlier judgment. <i>Cruz,</i> 204 F.3d at 19. Hence, parties who are in privity with each other are considered identical for res judicata purposes. <i>Banco Cent.,</i> 27 F.3d at 756-57.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Cruz,</i> we determined that privity existed between the plaintiffs and the Party (the plaintiff in the original commonwealth court action), stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the present appellants are not named parties in the commonwealth court proceedings, they are members of the organization that is the plaintiff there and they control that litigation. This type of privity suffices for res judicata purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">204 F.3d at 19. This determination depended on a combination of two factors: the plaintiffs were members of the Party <i>and</i> they controlled its conduct of the litigation. In turn, the finding of control derived from the <i>Cruz</i> plaintiffs' admissions. They made no bones about the fact that they were the prime movers behind the Party's case, \"vigorously assert[ing] that they were denied a full and fair opportunity to litigate <i>their</i> federal claims in the commonwealth proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied). Because the Cruz plaintiffs claimed ownership of the Party's case, we held them to the natural consequences of that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, the appellants engage in a largely didactic exercise, asserting that Cruz stands for the proposition that <i>any</i> member of a political party has control over litigation brought by that party (and, therefore, that the party is in privity with every one of its members). But this assertion rests on a porous foundation &#8212; the notion that <i>Cruz</i> means something other than what it says. We reject that notion. <i>Cruz</i> required proof of control as a building block in the showing of privity, and without such proof there would have been no privity in the circumstances of that case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This action is at a considerable remove. Unlike the <i>Cruz</i> plaintiffs, P&#233;rez steadfastly disclaims any exercise of control over the original case. In the absence of an admission, the appellants, as the proponents of the res judicata defense, have the burden of establishing a factual basis for that defense. <i>Banco Cent.,</i> 27 F.3d at 759. But they have not adduced any evidence sufficient to carry their burden (indeed, they have made no discernible effort to do so). They have shown only that P&#233;rez's attorney also represented the Party &#8212; and that is not a sufficient predicate for an inference of control. <i>See id.</i> (noting that courts regularly \"have refused to find substantial control merely because a nonparty retained the attorney who represented a party to the earlier action\"). The district court's finding that P&#233;rez did not control the prior litigation is, therefore, inexpugnable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' first fallback argument is that, even absent control, P&#233;rez's membership in the Party, his commonality of interests with the Party and its other members, and his desire to register the Party combine to establish privity as a matter of law. The Party, so this argument goes, is in privity with every one of its members because it sued to advance their associational rights. To a person, the members stood to gain if the Party had prevailed; thus, all of them should be bound by the Party's loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is misguided. Concepts of privity do not grow more expansive when a political party or its members raise First Amendment claims. After all, the fact that First Amendment rights are at stake ought to weigh against, not for, a finding of preclusion. <i>Cf. Richards v. Jefferson County,</i> 517 U.S. 793, 797, 116 S.Ct. 1761, 135 L.Ed.2d 76 (1996) (noting that \"extreme applications of the doctrine of res judicata may be inconsistent with a federal right that is `fundamental in character'\") (quoting <i>Postal Teleg. Cable Co. v. Newport,</i> 247 U.S. 464, 476, 38 S.Ct. 566, 62 L.Ed. 1215 (1918)); <i>Williams v. Rhodes,</i> 393 U.S. 23, 30-31, 89 S.Ct. 5, 21 L.Ed.2d 24 (1968) (acknowledging that First Amendment rights \"rank among our most precious freedoms\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At any rate, the question of whether an individual should be bound by an association's actions in a prior suit is distinct from whether, in practice, the right at issue has an associational component. As we explained in <i>Cruz,</i> \"<i>[i]ndividuals</i> have constitutionally protected interests in free association and electoral participation, including the formation of new political parties.\" 204 F.3d at 22 (emphasis supplied). Joining a political party is an exercise of associational rights, but forging such a link does not automatically consign the defense of those rights to the party. Although political parties may \"derive rights from their members,\" <i>FEC v. Colo. Repub. Fed. Campaign Comm.,</i> 533 U.S. 431, 448 n. 10, 121 S.Ct. 2351, 150 L.Ed.2d 461 (2001), the members' own rights are not automatically subsumed in a judgment against the party.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This might have been a closer case if the appellants had proven that the Party, in the manner, say, of certain labor unions or trade associations, served generally as the duly constituted representative of its members in litigation affecting common interests. <i>See, e.g., Gen. Foods Corp. v. Mass. Dep't of Pub. Health,</i> 648 F.2d 784, 787-88 (1st Cir.1981); <i>see generally</i> 18A Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Edward H. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure: Jurisdiction 2d &#167; 4456, at 502 (2002) (citing cases). But the record here is bereft of anything showing that either political parties in general or this Party in particular are invested with authority to represent members. In the absence of any evidence anent the Party's charter, bylaws, or membership terms, there is simply no basis for a finding that P&#233;rez ever authorized the Party, expressly or by fair implication, to sue on his behalf.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This lack of authorization is especially significant because the Party is a jural entity entitled to sue in its own right. Unlike the trade association in <i>General Foods,</i> 648 F.2d at 787, its standing to challenge the lawyer-notarization requirement did not \"depend[] on [any] claim to represent its members as the real parties in interest.\" And unlike the trade association in <i>Expert Electric, Inc. v. Levine,</i> 554 F.2d 1227, 1229 (2d Cir.1977), the Party was not \"established to jointly represent its [members]\" in all phases of a particular activity. Without such indicia, mere membership cannot allow the Party's actions to bind P&#233;rez. <i>See</i> Restatement (Second) of Judgments &#167; 61(2) (1982) (noting that if an unincorporated association is a jural entity distinct from its members, a judgment against the association binds its members only to the same extent as a judgment against a corporation binds its shareholders); <i>id.</i> &#167; 59 (explaining that, with exceptions not relevant here, a judgment in an action in which a corporation is a party does not bind corporate shareholders).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From what we have said, it should be evident that the commonality of First Amendment interests between a political party and its members is not itself enough to support a finding of privity. <i>See Griffin v. Burns,</i> 570 F.2d 1065, 1071 (1st Cir. 1978) (explaining, in a case involving First Amendment rights, that \"[m]ere similarity of interest and a quantum of representation in the earlier suit do[] not suffice to bar a non-party\"). Without evidence of either control or authorization, the appellants' proposition is untenable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants next argue for a determination of privity based on the doctrine of virtual representation &#8212; a term that is used as a synonym for \"<i>de facto</i> representation\" based on an identity of interests between a party to the earlier suit and a nonparty, <i>Banco Cent.,</i> 27 F.3d at 758 n. 5. That possibility need not occupy us for long. The appellants did not rely on this doctrine below and, accordingly, they have forfeited the right to raise it in this venue. <i>See, e.g., Teamsters Union, Local No. 59 v. Superline Transp. Co.,</i> 953 F.2d 17, 21 (1st Cir.1992) (\"If any principle is settled in this circuit, it is that, absent the most extraordinary circumstances, legal theories not raised squarely in the lower court cannot be broached for the first time on appeal.\"); <i>Clauson v. Smith,</i> 823 F.2d 660, 666 (1st Cir.1987) (holding that new legal theories \"cannot be surfaced for the first time on appeal\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even absent this procedural default, the argument would be unavailing. The record here is barren of any evidence that would support a finding of virtual representation. In particular, there is no proof that either P&#233;rez or the Party, in the institution of this action, were engaged in \"tactical maneuvering designed unfairly to exploit technical nonparty status in order to obtain multiple bites of the litigatory apple.\" <i>Banco Cent.,</i> 27 F.3d at 761. Given this dearth of evidence, we cannot find that the Party represented P&#233;rez, virtually or otherwise, in maintaining the earlier action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The authorities relied upon by the appellants in support of their various res judicata theories are inapposite here. We briefly discuss the two principal decisions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Tahoe-Sierra Preservation Council v. Tahoe Regional Planning Agency,</i> 322 F.3d 1064 (9th Cir.2003), the plaintiff association was formed for the avowed purpose of actively representing the interests of its individual members before various regulatory agencies and had the authority to bring claims on behalf of its members. <i>Id.</i> at 1083. On that basis, the court concluded, with liberal use of adverbs, that \"the Association represented the interests of its member property owners sufficiently thoroughly to bind other members alleging similar wrongs arising from the same set of facts.\" <i>Id.</i> (footnote omitted). The factors that the <i>Tahoe</i> court found significant, such as association for the express purpose of litigation and authorization of representation, are totally absent here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">So too <i>Tyus v. Schoemehl,</i> 93 F.3d 449 (8th Cir.1996), in which the aldermen-plaintiffs filed a second action while the first was pending, \"simply adding new plaintiffs.\" <i>Id.</i> at 457. The court found unmistakable evidence of \"tactical maneuvering\" such that not applying preclusion would have \"allow[ed] various members of a coordinated group to bring separate lawsuits in the hope that one member of the group would eventually be successful, benefiting the entire group.\" <i>Id.</i> As we have observed, however, there is no evidence that P&#233;rez is part of a coordinated strategy to circumvent a prior judgment. The appellants simply have not proven collusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the facts and the law arrayed against them, the appellants shift their emphasis to policy grounds. They contend that a rule of blanket preclusion is necessary to promote finality and forestall manipulative practices, including claim-splitting, forum-shopping, and serial litigation. But we are skeptical of the value of a mechanical rule, and there is no sign that any manipulation occurred <i>in this case.</i> The appellants have not shown that P&#233;rez is a puppet dancing on a string pulled by the Party or that the Party has orchestrated a strategy of serial attacks on the lawyer-notarization requirement. In lieu of proof, the appellants apparently would have us infer guilt by association. We will not do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Relatedly, the appellants predict disaster if blanket preclusion is rejected. They insinuate that members of a political party would have no incentive to join a pending action, for they would benefit if the party won but would be free to litigate the point if the party lost. Endless litigation would be the norm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This prediction is much too gloomy. For one thing, it overlooks the salutary effect of the doctrine of stare decisis on repetitive litigation. Perhaps more important, it overlooks the principle that \"[t]he law does not impose upon any person absolutely entitled to a hearing the burden of voluntary intervention in a suit to which he is a stranger.\" <i>Chase Nat'l Bank v. Norwalk,</i> 291 U.S. 431, 441, 54 S.Ct. 475, 78 L.Ed. 894 (1934); <i>accord Martin v. Wilks,</i> 490 U.S. 755, 763, 109 S.Ct. 2180, 104 L.Ed.2d 835 (1989) (reaffirming that \"a party seeking a judgment binding on another cannot obligate that person to intervene; he must be joined\"). Finally, the appellants' prediction proves too much: many others also stood to benefit from the Party's litigation (for example, other aspiring political parties and their members) &#8212; yet no one is sanguine enough to suggest that they too should be bound by its defeat. So long as we retain our historic tradition that each person is entitled to his own day in court, we cannot extend preclusion to nonparties merely because they have failed to seize an opportunity to intervene in a prior action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. As we have said, Puerto Rico law supplies the rule of decision as to the efficacy of the res judicata defense in this case. The appellants have not persuaded us that the Puerto Rico courts would find privity in these circumstances. <i>See, e.g., Montalvo-Huertas v. Rivera-Cruz,</i> 885 F.2d 971, 975 (1st Cir.1989) (holding, under Puerto Rico law, that a corporation was not in privity with the plaintiff class in a prior action challenging the same business regulation merely because the two sets of plaintiffs enjoyed a \"community of interest\"); <i>Pol Sella v. Lugo Christian,</i> 107 P.R. Dec. 540, 549 (1978) (explaining that res judicata applies when the same person is the real party in interest vis-&#224;-vis both suits); <i>Heirs of Zayas Berrios v. Berrios,</i> 90 P.R.R. 537, 552 (1964) (finding identity of parties where defendants in second case \"actually controlled\" the first case); <i>cf. A &amp; P Gen. Contractors, Inc. v. Associaci&#243;n Can&#225;, Inc.,</i> 110 P.R. Dec. 753, 10 P.R. Off. Trans. 987, 994-95 (1981) (reiterating that Puerto Rico has not \"abandoned the rule of ... identity\" with respect to res judicata). In the absence of privity, it necessarily follows that the district court did not err in refusing to honor the res judicata defense.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. THE MERITS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to the heart of the matter: the interaction between the lawyer-notarization requirement and the First Amendment. We review de novo the trial court's elucidation of First Amendment standards and its application of those standards to the discerned facts. <i>Globe Newsp. Co. v. Beacon Hill Arch'l Comm'n,</i> 100 F.3d 175, 181 (1st Cir.1996); <i>Kassel v. Gannett Co.,</i> 875 F.2d 935, 937 (1st Cir. 1989). This protocol is not a procedural device, but, rather, \"a rule of federal constitutional law\" reflecting \"a deeply held conviction that judges ... must exercise such review in order to preserve the precious liberties established and ordained by the Constitution.\" <i>Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of U.S., Inc.,</i> 466 U.S. 485, 510-11, 104 S.Ct. 1949, 80 L.Ed.2d 502 (1984).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like any other citizen, P&#233;rez has \"constitutionally protected interests in free association and electoral participation, including the formation of new political parties.\" <i>Cruz,</i> 204 F.3d at 22 (collecting cases). Although these interests are important, they are not absolute. Fair, honest, and orderly elections do not just happen. Substantial state regulation is a prophylactic that keeps the democratic process from disintegrating into chaos. Consequently, there is a strong state interest in regulating all phases of the electoral process, including ballot access. <i>Storer v. Brown,</i> 415 U.S. 724, 730, 94 S.Ct. 1274, 39 L.Ed.2d 714 (1974); <i>Libertarian Party of Me. v. Diamond,</i> 992 F.2d 365, 370 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not mean to minimize the schizophrenic nature of election campaigns, which are as much a means of disseminating ideas as a means of attaining political objectives. <i>See Ill. State Bd. of Elections v. Socialist Workers Party,</i> 440 U.S. 173, 186, 99 S.Ct. 983, 59 L.Ed.2d 230 (1979). Given this duality, an overly stringent regulatory scheme may place an intolerably heavy burden on freedom of political expression. <i>See id.</i> In the last analysis, a fine line separates permissible regulation of state election processes from impermissible abridgement of First Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plotting that line calls for a careful reconciliation of competing centrifugal and centripetal forces. The rigorousness of the ensuing judicial inquiry depends upon the extent to which the challenged regulation burdens First Amendment rights. <i>Burdick v. Takushi,</i> 504 U.S. 428, 434, 112 S.Ct. 2059, 119 L.Ed.2d 245 (1992); <i>Werme v. Merrill,</i> 84 F.3d 479, 483 (1st Cir.1996). Following this prescription, we afford exacting scrutiny to severe restrictions on ballot access. <i>Cruz,</i> 204 F.3d at 22. That entails viewing such restrictions skeptically and requiring that they be drawn narrowly to advance compelling state interests. <i>Norman v. Reed,</i> 502 U.S. 279, 289, 112 S.Ct. 698, 116 L.Ed.2d 711 (1992). To this end, we start with an assessment of the severity of the restriction. We then proceed to identify the interests that the appellants believe justify its imposition, weigh the efficacy of the available alternatives, and decide where the lawyer-notarization requirement falls along the constitutional line. <i>Timmons v. Twin Cities Area New Party,</i> 520 U.S. 351, 358, 117 S.Ct. 1364, 137 L.Ed.2d 589 (1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We approach the question of severity by looking first at its theoretical underpinnings. Traditionally, the act of circulating a petition has been viewed as \"a one-on-one communication.\" <i>Buckley v. Am. Const. Law Found.,</i> 525 U.S. 182, 199, 119 S.Ct. 636, 142 L.Ed.2d 599 (1999).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> One person circulates the petition, obtains the voter's signature, and verifies the origins of the signature. <i>See, e.g., Frami v. Ponto,</i> 255 F.Supp.2d 962, 965 (W.D.Wis.2003). In Puerto Rico, however, each of the 100,000 petitions must be signed singly and sworn in the presence of a lawyer-notary. This requirement triangulates the normal channels of communication. Assuming that the circulator is not himself a notary, there must now be one person to initiate the conversation, a second to respond, and a third to verify that response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This triangulation limits the efficacy of petition circulators in their own right. No matter how persuasive a circulator might be in a face-to-face conversation, he cannot seal the deal then and there. The final exchange in the interactive communication &#8212; the voter's official endorsement of the fledgling party &#8212; cannot occur unless and until a notary is present. The historic role of the circulator is necessarily diminished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, P&#233;rez plainly labored under this heavy yoke. He testified without contradiction that the lawyer-notarization requirement greatly hampered his efforts to gather signatures because, in addition to convincing voters that a new political party was needed, he also had to convince them to repair to an attorney's office. When he tried to recruit others to help in the circulation of petitions, those whom he could interest were \"just common people,\" not notaries. The district court credited this testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The stringency of the restriction is aggravated because the indispensable third person in the triangulated relationship &#8212; the notary &#8212; may prove hard to find. In most jurisdictions, it is neither impractical nor burdensome for party members to become notaries so that they may verify the petitions that they circulate. <i>See Am. Party of Tex.,</i> 415 U.S. at 787, 94 S.Ct. 1296. But Puerto Rico's restriction of notarial status to licensed attorneys erects a high barrier to entry and virtually ensures that the supply of notaries will remain inelastic notwithstanding voters' attempts to mount new-party registration drives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is this a purely theoretical difficulty. The district court found that Puerto Rico has only 8,000 lawyer-notaries, more or less. <i>See P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 391. Hence, the ratio of notaries to voters is quite small, and common sense suggests that there may be areas of the island where lawyers (and, thus, notaries) are in short supply. Even in areas where notaries are plentiful, someone must travel; either the voter must visit the notary's office or the notary must take to the field.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; someone must pay the freight.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The district court determined that the average cost for notarizing a simple document signed at a lawyer's office is between $15-$20; the cost if the lawyer travels to the site of the signing escalates to $50-$60; those who would form a party by petition need to collect a minimum of 100,000 signatures; and, accordingly, the lawyer-notarization requirement adds at least $1,500,000 to the cost of a successful petition drive. <i>Id.</i> at 391-92. The court further found that this was \"an unreasonably high price tag for an individual who is seeking to exercise his constitutional rights.\" <i>Id.</i> at 392 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These findings are wholly supportable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Indeed, the court's cost estimates may be conservative because, as a practical matter, a group attempting to form a party by petition will need to gather a surplus of signatures (as challenges likely will result in a number of invalidations). The court's findings make manifest that the task of registering a new political party is one of daunting proportions. We hold, therefore, that the lawyer-notarization requirement imposes a severe restriction on P&#233;rez's ability to register a new political party, and, in turn, on his right to access the ballot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' only direct rejoinder is to remind us that the Puerto Rican Renewal Party (PRRP) managed to register for the 1984 election as a party by petition. But no other party has duplicated that feat in the quarter-century since section 3101(3) was enacted, <i>see CAP I,</i> Off. Trans. at 9, so this is hardly an indication that the lawyer-notarization requirement is a piece of cake. <i>Cf. Storer,</i> 415 U.S. at 742, 94 S.Ct. 1274 (noting evidentiary significance of a showing that particular types of aspirants have \"qualified [for the general ballot] with some regularity\"). The PRRP example demonstrates, at most, that the lawyer-notarization requirement is not insuperable &#8212; not that the requirement is less than severe. It follows that such a showing does not foreclose P&#233;rez's suit. <i>See, e.g., Anderson v. Celebrezze,</i> 460 U.S. 780, 791 n. 12, 103 S.Ct. 1564, 75 L.Ed.2d 547 (1983) (explaining that the ability of a few individuals to qualify as independent presidential candidates \"d[id] not negate the burden imposed\" by the challenged regulation); <i>cf. Am. Party of Tex.,</i> 415 U.S. at 783, 94 S.Ct. 1296 (explaining that what is demanded as a condition to ballot access \"may not be so excessive or impractical as to be in reality a mere device to always, <i>or almost always,</i> exclude parties with significant support from the ballot\") (emphasis supplied).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apart from this glancing reference to the PRRP's success, the appellants do not seriously dispute the severe impact of the lawyer-notarization requirement. Instead, they attempt to confess and avoid. Their effort tracks three main avenues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the appellants propose that a reviewing court should afford Puerto Rico wide latitude vis-&#224;-vis the challenged regulation because the Supreme Court, in <i>American Party of Texas</i> and <i>Jenness,</i> upheld other notarization and petitioning requirements as reasonable. This proposition overlooks the fact that both cases were decided before the Supreme Court crystallized its current standard of inquiry in cases such as <i>Burdick,</i> 504 U.S. at 434, 112 S.Ct. 2059. More important, it overlooks the salient differences that distinguish those two cases from the case at bar. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Court sanctioned a notarization requirement in <i>American Party of Texas,</i> it gave no indication that Texas limited notarial status to members of the bar. Moreover, the relevant numerical threshold was one percent of the active electorate &#8212; not five percent &#8212; and bulk notarization seems to have been available. 415 U.S. at 775 n. 6, 94 S.Ct. 1296. The Georgia law at issue in <i>Jenness</i> required signatures from five percent of the active electorate but imposed no concomitant notarization requirement with respect to individual voters' signatures. 403 U.S. at 439, 91 S.Ct. 1970.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These differences make it clear that the appellants are comparing plums to pomegranates: whereas <i>American Party of Texas</i> dealt with a claim that a garden-variety notarization requirement constituted a severe restriction and <i>Jenness</i> dealt with a claim that a petitioning requirement constituted a severe restriction, the case before us turns on the synergy among three discrete factors: the five percent numerical requirement; the requirement that each signature be individually notarized; and the restriction of notarial practice in Puerto Rico to lawyers. It is this synergy that places section 3101(3) beyond the pale, for it transforms the dynamics of participation in the electoral process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' second avenue for marginalizing the severity of the imposed restriction involves drawing a distinction between the act of seeking support from the voter (which anyone can do at any time and place) and the act of authenticating the voter's signature. The appellants argue that the lawyer-notarization requirement comes into play only after the voter has agreed to subscribe a petition and, thus, does not have First Amendment implications. The requirement merely \"regulate[s] the mechanics of the electoral process,\" not \"the communicative aspect of petitioning.\" <i>CAP II,</i> Off. Trans. at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This distinction is artificial. Petition circulators &#8212; persons like P&#233;rez&#8212;are free only in theory \"to convey their political message through whatever means they may deem convenient.\" <i>Id.</i> The notarization requirement's looming presence forces the circulator to structure his communications and choose his target audiences with that requirement in mind. P&#233;rez, like most persons, is not a notary. In principle, he is free to go from door to door soliciting support for the Party, but in practice his rate of return will suffer because he cannot gather endorsing signatures on the spot. The record makes clear not only that some voters who would be willing to sign petitions are not willing to venture to a law office but also that P&#233;rez faces enormous difficulties in persuading notaries to accompany him in search of prospects. Given the reality of events, the lawyer-notarization requirement burdens petitioning by causing the utility of a communication to vary with its setting and with the qualifications of the circulator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would serve no useful purpose to dwell upon this line of argument. The short of it is that a state cannot separate petitioning into two steps, close off the second step to all but a tiny professional class, and then ignore the effects of that restriction. <i>See Buckley,</i> 525 U.S. at 194-95, 119 S.Ct. 636 (invalidating a registration requirement that unduly \"limi[ts] the number of voices who will convey [the proponent's] message\" (quoting <i>Meyer v.

Under this rubric, they note that P&#233;rez collected a total of fewer than 80 signatures (only 19 of which were actually presented to the Commission). Based on this \"meager\" effort, they fault the district court for failing to address the issue of whether P&#233;rez had made a diligent effort to obtain the requisite number of petitions. In their view, the absence of due diligence should bar any claim that the lawyer-notarization requirement \"caused\" P&#233;rez's inability to register the Party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants derive this due diligence condition from a misreading of <i>Storer.</i> In that case, the Supreme Court remanded for further factfinding as to whether, \"in the context of California politics ... a reasonably diligent independent candidate [could] be expected to satisfy the signature requirements\" imposed by a state statute regulating the filing of nomination papers by independent candidates. 415 U.S. at 742, 94 S.Ct. 1274. Contrary to the appellants' importunings, this language did not portend that only those who demonstrate due diligence can mount a First Amendment challenge to a ballot access requirement. The <i>Storer</i> remand went to the burdensomeness of the challenged regulation (i.e., its severity), not to causation. While a particular plaintiff's \"[p]ast experience\" can have evidentiary significance in an assessment of severity, <i>id.,</i> a showing of personal due diligence is not an element of a ballot access claim, <i>see, e.g., Norman,</i> 502 U.S. at 293, 112 S.Ct. 698 (holding that a state may not \"require petitioners to gather twice as many signatures to field candidates in [a multidistrict subdivision] as they would need statewide\" without inquiring whether petitioners had shown due diligence in trying to satisfy the challenged requirement); <i>Anderson,</i> 460 U.S. at 802-04, 103 S.Ct. 1564 (discussing challenge without asking whether the petitioner had shown due diligence in attempting to meet Ohio's early filing deadline). Indeed, a rule such as that espoused by the appellants would tend to inoculate even the most blatantly unconstitutional electoral requirements from legitimate attack.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this phase of our analysis.

This includes an \"important state interest in requiring some preliminary showing of a significant modicum of support before printing the name of a political organization's candidate on the ballot.\" <i>Jenness,</i> 403 U.S. at 442, 91 S.Ct. 1970. That interest is directly served by the five percent petitioning requirement. <i>See Lubin v. Panish,</i> 415 U.S. 709, 718, 94 S.Ct. 1315, 39 L.Ed.2d 702 (1974) (terming a signature requirement the \"obvious\" means of testing a candidate's level of support). The conundrum here involves an additional safeguard &#8212; the lawyer-notarization requirement &#8212; and the interests it advances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants have identified only one such interest: preventing election fraud. They assert that notarization is necessary to \"remed[y] a type of electoral fraud that the Puerto Rico Legislature found to ha[ve] been pervasive.\" Appellants' Reply Br. at 39. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court echoed this sentiment. It declared that notarization \"serves a compelling state interest in guaranteeing the integrity of the electoral process, given the history of electoral fraud and corruption experienced in Puerto Rico.\" <i>CAP I,</i> Off. Trans. at 15. In this regard, the court singled out \"[t]he popular practice of manipulating the voting lists.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though we accept the legitimacy of this interest, we must nonetheless mull the extent to which that interest renders it necessary to burden P&#233;rez's rights so severely. <i>See Anderson,</i> 460 U.S. at 789, 103 S.Ct. 1564. The question of whether the lawyer-notarization requirement is narrowly fashioned to advance the identified state interest boils down to whether notarization by a lawyer is more likely to reduce fraud by any or all of the participants in the transaction than other available (less restrictive) alternatives. We examine this question from a variety of perspectives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the voter, the appellants contend that notarization gives some meaningful assurance that voters' signatures are authentic. \"The [voter] takes oath to that fact and experience has shown that many people take their oaths seriously.\" <i>Libertarian Party of Va. v. Davis,</i> 591 F.Supp. 1561, 1564 (E.D.Va.1984), <i>aff'd,</i> 766 F.2d 865 (4th Cir.1985). But this contention is disingenuous, for it is the oath that guarantees honesty &#8212; not the pedigree of the oath-giver. The appellants do not suggest that people take oaths less seriously in jurisdictions where notaries need not be lawyers or in jurisdictions where affirmations are taken by non-notary witnesses. The idea that notarization <i>by a lawyer</i> will significantly reduce voter fraud is utterly unsupported by the record; there is nothing to show that a voter bent on committing petition fraud will be less brazen in front of a lawyer-notary than in front of some other type of witness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to petition circulators. The appellants offer no developed argumentation to the effect that notarization by a lawyer will discourage circulator fraud. We assume that this is a concession. <i>See United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (holding that points raised on appeal in a perfunctory fashion, without developed argumentation, are conceded). In any event, the district court effectively scotched any such notion, observing that \"[a] lawyer will notarize a signature merely by verifying the signatory's identification,\" and that \"[t]here is no reason to believe that attorneys who happen to be notaries are somehow more adept than non-lawyers at reading and verifying\" identification documents. <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 393.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the notary himself. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court suggested that the lawyer-notarization requirement \"allows for the imposition of sanctions for any illegal act committed by the person before whom the petition is sworn to.\" <i>CAP I,</i> Off. Trans. at 14 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). But this rationale does not itself distinguish the lawyer-notary from any other person who may be authorized by the Commission to verify petitions. One need be neither a lawyer nor a notary to be fined or imprisoned for participating in the preparation of fraudulent documents. <i>See, e.g.,</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33, &#167; 4437 (2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that \"notarial practice is strictly regulated\" in Puerto Rico; that notaries are \"the only officers vested by the [Puerto Rico] Supreme Court with the authority to guarantee ... the authenticity of the documents executed before them\"; and that \"[t]he intervention of a notary establishes a presumption of veracity in all the documents authenticated by him or her.\" <i>CAP I,</i> Off. Trans. at 15 (citation omitted). But without some proof that lawyer-notarization is appreciably more effective at preventing petition fraud than non-lawyer verification &#8212; and the record contains none &#8212; all of this is beside the point. The fact that a state's asserted interest in preventing electoral fraud is important in the abstract does not create a presumption that its chosen means of regulation will advance that interest. <i>See Lerman,</i> 232 F.3d at 149.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a related vein, the appellants contend that the lawyer-notarization requirement is necessary because a successful petition effort stands to reap a munificent harvest for the Party &#8212; at least $600,000 from the Electoral Fund in an election year, $300,000 in a non-election year, and \"insider\" status for the next four years. <i>See CAP I,</i> Off. Trans. at 9 (noting that \"registered parties ... share in the Electoral Fund\"); <i>CAP II,</i> Off. Trans. at 9 (explaining that registration also allows a party to \"become a part of the government body that governs the electoral process, as a result of which it acquires quasi-public functions\"). These facts simply reinforce a proposition to which we already have subscribed, namely, that the state has a compelling interest in preventing the fraudulent registration of political parties. Access to special privileges says nothing about the effectiveness of lawyer-notarization as a means of advancing that interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering whether a ballot access requirement is narrowly drawn to advance the state's interest in preventing fraud, the mechanisms that the state already has in place serve as benchmarks. <i>Norman,</i> 502 U.S. at 294, 112 S.Ct. 698. We think it noteworthy, therefore, that the Commission routinely allows the use of ad hoc notaries for a wide variety of analogous purposes, e.g., \"for a person registering to vote, a voter changing his electoral address, petitioners seeking to have an independent candidate placed on the ballot, and petitions nominating candidates for primaries.\" <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 391.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> In addition, ad hoc notaries were authorized for use in the 1998 commonwealth-wide status plebiscite. <i>See CAP I,</i> Off. Trans. at 9. The record contains not one hint of election fraud or administrative error committed by, or under the auspices of, ad hoc notaries. Absent some evidence that the use of ad hoc notaries correlates with a higher incidence of corruption or unreliability, we cannot accept the Commission's ipse dixit that it needs to insist on the use of lawyer-notaries in the new-party petition context. <i>See Werme,</i> 84 F.3d at 485 (explaining that \"mere suspicion or paranoia is too flimsy a foundation on which to rest a claim of incipient fraud or mistake\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Referring back to a political party's access to the Electoral Fund and its opportunity to participate as an \"insider\" in the electoral system for a four-year period, the appellants posit that registration as a political party entails higher stakes than other matters (and, hence, that the use of ad hoc notaries in that context would be especially risky). By this logic, parties by petition are not situated similarly to independent candidates, candidates for major party primaries, or even groups participating in the plebiscite process. We think that this vastly overstates the matter; it is not obvious to us that, say, the status plebiscite was less important to the future of Puerto Rico than the registration of a new political party. We need not pursue this point, however, because the appellants have not shown that, compared with verification by ad hoc notaries, lawyer-notarization is superior in detecting and deterring petition fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that the use of ad hoc notaries is not the only feasible safeguard available to the Commission (indeed, the record strongly suggests that notarization may not even be the best means currently employed by the Commission). The Commission checks every petition to ensure that the signature is valid. <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 390. It is in the process of computerizing its voter registration records to include each registered voter's signature. This project is slated for completion later this year, and its completion will enhance the Commission's ability to verify petitions. To accomplish these tasks, the Commission has at its disposal a cadre of people not affiliated with any political party. These nonpartisan workers comprise the so-called Validations Unit, a unit that has the assignment of checking petitions one by one against the Commission's records. The Secretary of the Commission, in answer to a query from the district court, testified that \"it would not be difficult for the Commission to check [new-party] petitions ... against [its] records.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this specialized electoral context, the Commission's in-house verification procedure compares favorably with lawyer-notarization. As the district court found, a lawyer-notary usually verifies a signature by checking a driver's license, a passport, or some other identification document. <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 391. There is no indication that notaries compare signatures to those appearing on voting records or take steps to ensure that affiants are registered voters. The Commission, it appears, is better positioned than a notary to detect the species of fraud that purportedly justifies the lawyer-notarization requirement. <i>See CAP I,</i> Off. Trans. at 15 (offering as a justification the need to ferret out the \"popular practice of manipulating the voting lists\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. A state is entitled to take a \"belt-and-suspenders\" approach and put in place multiple mechanisms for ensuring the integrity of its electoral processes. Here, however, the record fails to show that lawyer-notarization adds anything over and above other readily available means of verification. Based in part on the absence of evidence that lawyer-notarization reduces electoral fraud and in part on the array of less restrictive alternatives available to the state (including the feasibility of using non-lawyers as ad hoc notaries and the Commission's apparent ability to verify every petition in-house), we find the lawyer-notarization requirement broader than necessary to serve the state's asserted interest. Consequently, the requirement embodied in section 3101(3) cannot survive a First Amendment challenge. <i>See Norman,</i> 502 U.S. at 293-94, 112 S.Ct. 698; <i>Krislov,</i> 226 F.3d at 866; <i>Cruz,</i> 204 F.3d at 22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.

We are mindful that our constitutional conclusion differs from that of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, and we do not lightly part company with so distinguished a tribunal.

Since only a lawyer can become a notary in Puerto Rico, there are fewer than 8,000 notaries in the entire commonwealth &#8212; and notarial services do not come cheap. Chafing under these restrictions, a nascent political party &#8212; the Partido Acci&#243;n Civil (the Party) &#8212; challenged various aspects of the law, including the lawyer-notarization requirement, in the local courts. The Party lost.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiff-appellee Jos&#233; Emilio P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n (P&#233;rez), a member of the Party who had not participated in the earlier suit, remained dissatisfied with the lawyer-notarization requirement. He sued the members of the Puerto Rico State Elections Commission (the Commission) in the federal district court. The district court rejected a proffered res judicata defense and found that the lawyer-notarization requirement violated the plaintiff's First Amendment rights. <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n v.

The res judicata issue involves the extent to which a judgment against an association can preclude a later action by a member of that association. The constitutional issue pits the government's interest in regulating elections against an individual's interests in electoral participation and freedom of association. Having worked our way through both issues, we conclude, as did the district court, that the instant action is not pretermitted by the prior judgment and that the lawyer-notarization requirement unduly burdens First Amendment rights. Consequently, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I.

Puerto Rico's rule that only attorneys can serve as notaries, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 4, &#167; 2011 (2000), is also rare.

We reviewed the procedural history of the Party's challenge to it in an earlier opinion, <i>see Cruz v. Melecio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198832\"><a href=\"/opinion/198832/oscar-cruz-v-melecio/\"><span class=\"volume\">204</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 17-18 (1st Cir.2000), and we briefly rehearse that history in order to put the appellants' res judicata defense into perspective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 6, 1998, the Party filed an action in the Puerto Rico Court of First Instance against the Commission and others.

The action raised essentially the same federal constitutional claims, including the claim that the lawyer-notarization requirement violated the plaintiffs' rights to free speech and association, to participate in the political process, to vote, and to enjoy equal protection of the laws. Cruz, 204 F.3d at 17. The district court dismissed the action on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An appeal ensued. In it, we first addressed the potential applicability of res judicata. We held that the defense did not apply because the commonwealth court proceedings were, at that point, still in progress. <i>Id.</i> at 20-21. We then determined that the district court had erred in dismissing the action for failure to state a potentially viable claim. <i>Id.</i> at 22. The complaint had alleged facts which, if true, \"tend[ed] to support the appellants' claims that the notarization requirement and seven-day [filing] deadline unduly burden ballot access.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If ... the appellants can prove that notarization is prohibitively expensive or otherwise difficult to achieve (as the complaint avers), then the Commission will have to show that the notarization requirement is narrowly drawn to advance a compelling governmental interest. This showing requires the Commission to come forward with proof. Whether it ultimately can succeed in this endeavor is a sufficiently open question that we cannot conclude, <i>on the pleadings,</i> that no set of facts exists under which the appellants might prevail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (footnote and internal citation omitted). Accordingly, we vacated the order of dismissal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Still, we did not allow the case to proceed unabated, but, rather, instructed the district court to stay further proceedings pending the Puerto Rico Supreme Court's decision. <i>Id.</i> at 25. Among the factors we found \"highly relevant to the calculus of abstention\" was our belief that \"the appellants [had] filed the present suit in an effort to detour around an unfavorable judgment of the commonwealth trial court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 24. After the Puerto Rico Supreme Court affirmed the judgment against the Party and the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari, the district court dismissed Cruz on res judicata grounds. The Cruz plaintiffs did not appeal, and that appeared to be the end of the matter.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appearances can be deceiving. The next year, P&#233;rez filed this action challenging the lawyer-notarization requirement (but not the seven-day filing requirement). In relevant part, the complaint sought a declaration that the lawyer-notarization requirement, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 16, &#167; 3101(3), violated P&#233;rez's rights to freedom of speech and equal protection. It also prayed for an injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing section 3101(3) and the corresponding regulations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After an evidentiary hearing, the district court entered an order \"declaring the requirement... that petitions for new political parties be notarized by a lawyer to be in violation of the First Amendment of the Constitution.\" <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 394. The court's determination rested in large part on the idiosyncratic nature of Puerto Rico's lawyer-notarization requirement. In that regard, the court made three critical findings. First, it found as a fact that the cost of notarizing 100,000 petitions would be at least $1,500,000. Given this substantial outlay, the lawyer-notarization requirement imposed a severe financial burden upon a citizen's \"right to associate and to form political organizations which advance common goals and ideals.\" <i>Id.</i> at 392 (footnote omitted). Second, the court found that the appellants had failed to show that the lawyer-notarization requirement was narrowly tailored to advance a compelling governmental interest. <i>Id.</i> at 393. In making this point, the court emphasized that in other electoral contexts the Commission had authorized ordinary voters to verify signatures despite the fact that they were not notaries, but had refused to sanction any comparable arrangement for witnessing party-registration petitions. <i>Id.</i> at 391, 393. There was no evidence that lawyer-notaries perform this attestation function better than authorized ad hoc notaries. <i>Id.</i> at 393. Finally, the court found that other existing safeguards, such as the Commission's practice of independently verifying each petition submitted to it, adequately protect Puerto Rico's legitimate interest in the integrity of its electoral processes. <i>Id.</i> at 390, 393.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a separate (unpublished) order, the court rejected the asserted res judicata defense. The court found no privity between P&#233;rez and the Party because the record did not show that P&#233;rez had in any way participated in or controlled the Party's case. Indeed, the court found \"no evidence\" that P&#233;rez was even a Party member during the currency of the earlier litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the entry of a judgment declaring section 3101(3) unconstitutional, these timely appeals eventuated. In an abundance of caution, we stayed the execution of the judgment and expedited appellate review. We now confront the substance of the appeals. Because the res judicata defense, if successful, would end our inquiry, we start there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. RES JUDICATA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The applicability of the doctrine of res judicata presents a question of law over which we exercise plenary review. <i>See Gonzalez v.

Inasmuch as we are called upon here to determine the preclusive effect of a judgment entered by the commonwealth courts, Puerto Rico law supplies the rule of decision. <i>Kremer v. Chem. Constr.

Laws Ann. tit. 31, &#167; 3343 (1990). The issue here involves the identity of the parties in the two actions. We know that the requirement of \"perfect identity\" cannot be taken literally; mere nominal differences will not undermine the preclusive effect of an earlier judgment. <i>Cruz,</i> 204 F.3d at 19. Hence, parties who are in privity with each other are considered identical for res judicata purposes. <i>Banco Cent.,</i> 27 F.3d at 756-57.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Cruz,</i> we determined that privity existed between the plaintiffs and the Party (the plaintiff in the original commonwealth court action), stating:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the present appellants are not named parties in the commonwealth court proceedings, they are members of the organization that is the plaintiff there and they control that litigation. This type of privity suffices for res judicata purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">204 F.3d at 19. This determination depended on a combination of two factors: the plaintiffs were members of the Party <i>and</i> they controlled its conduct of the litigation. In turn, the finding of control derived from the <i>Cruz</i> plaintiffs' admissions. They made no bones about the fact that they were the prime movers behind the Party's case, \"vigorously assert[ing] that they were denied a full and fair opportunity to litigate <i>their</i> federal claims in the commonwealth proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis supplied). Because the Cruz plaintiffs claimed ownership of the Party's case, we held them to the natural consequences of that claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, the appellants engage in a largely didactic exercise, asserting that Cruz stands for the proposition that <i>any</i> member of a political party has control over litigation brought by that party (and, therefore, that the party is in privity with every one of its members). But this assertion rests on a porous foundation &#8212; the notion that <i>Cruz</i> means something other than what it says. We reject that notion. <i>Cruz</i> required proof of control as a building block in the showing of privity, and without such proof there would have been no privity in the circumstances of that case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This action is at a considerable remove. Unlike the <i>Cruz</i> plaintiffs, P&#233;rez steadfastly disclaims any exercise of control over the original case. In the absence of an admission, the appellants, as the proponents of the res judicata defense, have the burden of establishing a factual basis for that defense. <i>Banco Cent.,</i> 27 F.3d at 759. But they have not adduced any evidence sufficient to carry their burden (indeed, they have made no discernible effort to do so). They have shown only that P&#233;rez's attorney also represented the Party &#8212; and that is not a sufficient predicate for an inference of control. <i>See id.</i> (noting that courts regularly \"have refused to find substantial control merely because a nonparty retained the attorney who represented a party to the earlier action\"). The district court's finding that P&#233;rez did not control the prior litigation is, therefore, inexpugnable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' first fallback argument is that, even absent control, P&#233;rez's membership in the Party, his commonality of interests with the Party and its other members, and his desire to register the Party combine to establish privity as a matter of law. The Party, so this argument goes, is in privity with every one of its members because it sued to advance their associational rights. To a person, the members stood to gain if the Party had prevailed; thus, all of them should be bound by the Party's loss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is misguided. Concepts of privity do not grow more expansive when a political party or its members raise First Amendment claims. After all, the fact that First Amendment rights are at stake ought to weigh against, not for, a finding of preclusion. <i>Cf. Richards v.

But the record here is bereft of anything showing that either political parties in general or this Party in particular are invested with authority to represent members. In the absence of any evidence anent the Party's charter, bylaws, or membership terms, there is simply no basis for a finding that P&#233;rez ever authorized the Party, expressly or by fair implication, to sue on his behalf.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This lack of authorization is especially significant because the Party is a jural entity entitled to sue in its own right. Unlike the trade association in <i>General Foods,</i> 648 F.2d at 787, its standing to challenge the lawyer-notarization requirement did not \"depend[] on [any] claim to represent its members as the real parties in interest.\" And unlike the trade association in <i>Expert Electric, Inc. v.

That possibility need not occupy us for long.

The court found unmistakable evidence of \"tactical maneuvering\" such that not applying preclusion would have \"allow[ed] various members of a coordinated group to bring separate lawsuits in the hope that one member of the group would eventually be successful, benefiting the entire group.\" <i>Id.</i> As we have observed, however, there is no evidence that P&#233;rez is part of a coordinated strategy to circumvent a prior judgment.

They contend that a rule of blanket preclusion is necessary to promote finality and forestall manipulative practices, including claim-splitting, forum-shopping, and serial litigation. But we are skeptical of the value of a mechanical rule, and there is no sign that any manipulation occurred <i>in this case.</i> The appellants have not shown that P&#233;rez is a puppet dancing on a string pulled by the Party or that the Party has orchestrated a strategy of serial attacks on the lawyer-notarization requirement.

Finally, the appellants' prediction proves too much: many others also stood to benefit from the Party's litigation (for example, other aspiring political parties and their members) &#8212; yet no one is sanguine enough to suggest that they too should be bound by its defeat.

Law Found.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118254\"><a href=\"/opinion/118254/buckley-v-american-constitutional-law-foundation-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 199, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118254\"><a href=\"/opinion/118254/buckley-v-american-constitutional-law-foundation-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span> (1999).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> One person circulates the petition, obtains the voter's signature, and verifies the origins of the signature. <i>See, e.g., Frami v. Ponto,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2562617\"><a href=\"/opinion/2562617/frami-v-ponto/\"><span class=\"volume\">255</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">962</span></a></span>, 965 (W.D.Wis.2003). In Puerto Rico, however, each of the 100,000 petitions must be signed singly and sworn in the presence of a lawyer-notary. This requirement triangulates the normal channels of communication. Assuming that the circulator is not himself a notary, there must now be one person to initiate the conversation, a second to respond, and a third to verify that response.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This triangulation limits the efficacy of petition circulators in their own right. No matter how persuasive a circulator might be in a face-to-face conversation, he cannot seal the deal then and there. The final exchange in the interactive communication &#8212; the voter's official endorsement of the fledgling party &#8212; cannot occur unless and until a notary is present. The historic role of the circulator is necessarily diminished.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, P&#233;rez plainly labored under this heavy yoke. He testified without contradiction that the lawyer-notarization requirement greatly hampered his efforts to gather signatures because, in addition to convincing voters that a new political party was needed, he also had to convince them to repair to an attorney's office. When he tried to recruit others to help in the circulation of petitions, those whom he could interest were \"just common people,\" not notaries. The district court credited this testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The stringency of the restriction is aggravated because the indispensable third person in the triangulated relationship &#8212; the notary &#8212; may prove hard to find. In most jurisdictions, it is neither impractical nor burdensome for party members to become notaries so that they may verify the petitions that they circulate. <i>See Am. Party of Tex.,</i> 415 U.S. at 787, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108994\"><a href=\"/opinion/108994/american-party-of-tex-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span>. But Puerto Rico's restriction of notarial status to licensed attorneys erects a high barrier to entry and virtually ensures that the supply of notaries will remain inelastic notwithstanding voters' attempts to mount new-party registration drives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is this a purely theoretical difficulty. The district court found that Puerto Rico has only 8,000 lawyer-notaries, more or less. <i>See P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 391. Hence, the ratio of notaries to voters is quite small, and common sense suggests that there may be areas of the island where lawyers (and, thus, notaries) are in short supply. Even in areas where notaries are plentiful, someone must travel; either the voter must visit the notary's office or the notary must take to the field.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; someone must pay the freight.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> The district court determined that the average cost for notarizing a simple document signed at a lawyer's office is between $15-$20; the cost if the lawyer travels to the site of the signing escalates to $50-$60; those who would form a party by petition need to collect a minimum of 100,000 signatures; and, accordingly, the lawyer-notarization requirement adds at least $1,500,000 to the cost of a successful petition drive. <i>Id.</i> at 391-92. The court further found that this was \"an unreasonably high price tag for an individual who is seeking to exercise his constitutional rights.\" <i>Id.</i> at 392 (footnote omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These findings are wholly supportable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Indeed, the court's cost estimates may be conservative because, as a practical matter, a group attempting to form a party by petition will need to gather a surplus of signatures (as challenges likely will result in a number of invalidations). The court's findings make manifest that the task of registering a new political party is one of daunting proportions. We hold, therefore, that the lawyer-notarization requirement imposes a severe restriction on P&#233;rez's ability to register a new political party, and, in turn, on his right to access the ballot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' only direct rejoinder is to remind us that the Puerto Rican Renewal Party (PRRP) managed to register for the 1984 election as a party by petition. But no other party has duplicated that feat in the quarter-century since section 3101(3) was enacted, <i>see CAP I,</i> Off. Trans. at 9, so this is hardly an indication that the lawyer-notarization requirement is a piece of cake. <i>Cf. Storer,</i> 415 U.S. at 742, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108993\"><a href=\"/opinion/108993/storer-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1274</span></a></span> (noting evidentiary significance of a showing that particular types of aspirants have \"qualified [for the general ballot] with some regularity\"). The PRRP example demonstrates, at most, that the lawyer-notarization requirement is not insuperable &#8212; not that the requirement is less than severe. It follows that such a showing does not foreclose P&#233;rez's suit. <i>See, e.g., Anderson v. Celebrezze,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110904\"><a href=\"/opinion/110904/anderson-v-celebrezze/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">780</span></a></span>, 791 n. 12, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110904\"><a href=\"/opinion/110904/anderson-v-celebrezze/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Instead, they attempt to confess and avoid. Their effort tracks three main avenues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the appellants propose that a reviewing court should afford Puerto Rico wide latitude vis-&#224;-vis the challenged regulation because the Supreme Court, in <i>American Party of Texas</i> and <i>Jenness,</i> upheld other notarization and petitioning requirements as reasonable. This proposition overlooks the fact that both cases were decided before the Supreme Court crystallized its current standard of inquiry in cases such as <i>Burdick,</i> 504 U.S. at 434, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112743\"><a href=\"/opinion/112743/burdick-v-takushi/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2059</span></a></span>. More important, it overlooks the salient differences that distinguish those two cases from the case at bar. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Court sanctioned a notarization requirement in <i>American Party of Texas,</i> it gave no indication that Texas limited notarial status to members of the bar. Moreover, the relevant numerical threshold was one percent of the active electorate &#8212; not five percent &#8212; and bulk notarization seems to have been available. 415 U.S. at 775 n. 6, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108994\"><a href=\"/opinion/108994/american-party-of-tex-v-white/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1296</span></a></span>. The Georgia law at issue in <i>Jenness</i> required signatures from five percent of the active electorate but imposed no concomitant notarization requirement with respect to individual voters' signatures. 403 U.S. at 439, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108376\"><a href=\"/opinion/108376/jenness-v-fortson/\"><span class=\"volume\">91</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1970</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These differences make it clear that the appellants are comparing plums to pomegranates: whereas <i>American Party of Texas</i> dealt with a claim that a garden-variety notarization requirement constituted a severe restriction and <i>Jenness</i> dealt with a claim that a petitioning requirement constituted a severe restriction, the case before us turns on the synergy among three discrete factors: the five percent numerical requirement; the requirement that each signature be individually notarized; and the restriction of notarial practice in Puerto Rico to lawyers. It is this synergy that places section 3101(3) beyond the pale, for it transforms the dynamics of participation in the electoral process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants' second avenue for marginalizing the severity of the imposed restriction involves drawing a distinction between the act of seeking support from the voter (which anyone can do at any time and place) and the act of authenticating the voter's signature. The appellants argue that the lawyer-notarization requirement comes into play only after the voter has agreed to subscribe a petition and, thus, does not have First Amendment implications. The requirement merely \"regulate[s] the mechanics of the electoral process,\" not \"the communicative aspect of petitioning.\" <i>CAP II,</i> Off. Trans. at 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This distinction is artificial. Petition circulators &#8212; persons like P&#233;rez&#8212;are free only in theory \"to convey their political message through whatever means they may deem convenient.\" <i>Id.</i> The notarization requirement's looming presence forces the circulator to structure his communications and choose his target audiences with that requirement in mind. P&#233;rez, like most persons, is not a notary. In principle, he is free to go from door to door soliciting support for the Party, but in practice his rate of return will suffer because he cannot gather endorsing signatures on the spot. The record makes clear not only that some voters who would be willing to sign petitions are not willing to venture to a law office but also that P&#233;rez faces enormous difficulties in persuading notaries to accompany him in search of prospects. Given the reality of events, the lawyer-notarization requirement burdens petitioning by causing the utility of a communication to vary with its setting and with the qualifications of the circulator.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It would serve no useful purpose to dwell upon this line of argument. The short of it is that a state cannot separate petitioning into two steps, close off the second step to all but a tiny professional class, and then ignore the effects of that restriction. <i>See Buckley,</i> 525 U.S. at 194-95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118254\"><a href=\"/opinion/118254/buckley-v-american-constitutional-law-foundation-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under this rubric, they note that P&#233;rez collected a total of fewer than 80 signatures (only 19 of which were actually presented to the Commission). Based on this \"meager\" effort, they fault the district court for failing to address the issue of whether P&#233;rez had made a diligent effort to obtain the requisite number of petitions. In their view, the absence of due diligence should bar any claim that the lawyer-notarization requirement \"caused\" P&#233;rez's inability to register the Party.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants derive this due diligence condition from a misreading of <i>Storer.</i> In that case, the Supreme Court remanded for further factfinding as to whether, \"in the context of California politics ... a reasonably diligent independent candidate [could] be expected to satisfy the signature requirements\" imposed by a state statute regulating the filing of nomination papers by independent candidates. 415 U.S. at 742, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108993\"><a href=\"/opinion/108993/storer-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1274</span></a></span>. Contrary to the appellants' importunings, this language did not portend that only those who demonstrate due diligence can mount a First Amendment challenge to a ballot access requirement. The <i>Storer</i> remand went to the burdensomeness of the challenged regulation (i.e., its severity), not to causation. While a particular plaintiff's \"[p]ast experience\" can have evidentiary significance in an assessment of severity, <i>id.,</i> a showing of personal due diligence is not an element of a ballot access claim, <i>see, e.g., Norman,</i> 502 U.S. at 293, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112675\"><a href=\"/opinion/112675/norman-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Puerto Rico Supreme Court echoed this sentiment. It declared that notarization \"serves a compelling state interest in guaranteeing the integrity of the electoral process, given the history of electoral fraud and corruption experienced in Puerto Rico.\" <i>CAP I,</i> Off.

The question of whether the lawyer-notarization requirement is narrowly fashioned to advance the identified state interest boils down to whether notarization by a lawyer is more likely to reduce fraud by any or all of the participants in the transaction than other available (less restrictive) alternatives.

But this contention is disingenuous, for it is the oath that guarantees honesty &#8212; not the pedigree of the oath-giver. The appellants do not suggest that people take oaths less seriously in jurisdictions where notaries need not be lawyers or in jurisdictions where affirmations are taken by non-notary witnesses. The idea that notarization <i>by a lawyer</i> will significantly reduce voter fraud is utterly unsupported by the record; there is nothing to show that a voter bent on committing petition fraud will be less brazen in front of a lawyer-notary than in front of some other type of witness.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to petition circulators.

In any event, the district court effectively scotched any such notion, observing that \"[a] lawyer will notarize a signature merely by verifying the signatory's identification,\" and that \"[t]here is no reason to believe that attorneys who happen to be notaries are somehow more adept than non-lawyers at reading and verifying\" identification documents. <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 393.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the notary himself. The Puerto Rico Supreme Court suggested that the lawyer-notarization requirement \"allows for the imposition of sanctions for any illegal act committed by the person before whom the petition is sworn to.\" <i>CAP I,</i> Off. Trans. at 14 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). But this rationale does not itself distinguish the lawyer-notary from any other person who may be authorized by the Commission to verify petitions. One need be neither a lawyer nor a notary to be fined or imprisoned for participating in the preparation of fraudulent documents. <i>See, e.g.,</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 33, &#167; 4437 (2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that \"notarial practice is strictly regulated\" in Puerto Rico; that notaries are \"the only officers vested by the [Puerto Rico] Supreme Court with the authority to guarantee ... the authenticity of the documents executed before them\"; and that \"[t]he intervention of a notary establishes a presumption of veracity in all the documents authenticated by him or her.\" <i>CAP I,</i> Off. Trans. at 15 (citation omitted). But without some proof that lawyer-notarization is appreciably more effective at preventing petition fraud than non-lawyer verification &#8212; and the record contains none &#8212; all of this is beside the point. The fact that a state's asserted interest in preventing electoral fraud is important in the abstract does not create a presumption that its chosen means of regulation will advance that interest. <i>See Lerman,</i> 232 F.3d at 149.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a related vein, the appellants contend that the lawyer-notarization requirement is necessary because a successful petition effort stands to reap a munificent harvest for the Party &#8212; at least $600,000 from the Electoral Fund in an election year, $300,000 in a non-election year, and \"insider\" status for the next four years. <i>See CAP I,</i> Off. Trans. at 9 (noting that \"registered parties ... share in the Electoral Fund\"); <i>CAP II,</i> Off. Trans. at 9 (explaining that registration also allows a party to \"become a part of the government body that governs the electoral process, as a result of which it acquires quasi-public functions\"). These facts simply reinforce a proposition to which we already have subscribed, namely, that the state has a compelling interest in preventing the fraudulent registration of political parties. Access to special privileges says nothing about the effectiveness of lawyer-notarization as a means of advancing that interest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering whether a ballot access requirement is narrowly drawn to advance the state's interest in preventing fraud, the mechanisms that the state already has in place serve as benchmarks. <i>Norman,</i> 502 U.S. at 294, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112675\"><a href=\"/opinion/112675/norman-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">698</span></a></span>. We think it noteworthy, therefore, that the Commission routinely allows the use of ad hoc notaries for a wide variety of analogous purposes, e.g., \"for a person registering to vote, a voter changing his electoral address, petitioners seeking to have an independent candidate placed on the ballot, and petitions nominating candidates for primaries.\" <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 391.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> In addition, ad hoc notaries were authorized for use in the 1998 commonwealth-wide status plebiscite. <i>See CAP I,</i> Off. Trans. at 9. The record contains not one hint of election fraud or administrative error committed by, or under the auspices of, ad hoc notaries. Absent some evidence that the use of ad hoc notaries correlates with a higher incidence of corruption or unreliability, we cannot accept the Commission's ipse dixit that it needs to insist on the use of lawyer-notaries in the new-party petition context. <i>See Werme,</i> 84 F.3d at 485 (explaining that \"mere suspicion or paranoia is too flimsy a foundation on which to rest a claim of incipient fraud or mistake\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Referring back to a political party's access to the Electoral Fund and its opportunity to participate as an \"insider\" in the electoral system for a four-year period, the appellants posit that registration as a political party entails higher stakes than other matters (and, hence, that the use of ad hoc notaries in that context would be especially risky). By this logic, parties by petition are not situated similarly to independent candidates, candidates for major party primaries, or even groups participating in the plebiscite process. We think that this vastly overstates the matter; it is not obvious to us that, say, the status plebiscite was less important to the future of Puerto Rico than the registration of a new political party. We need not pursue this point, however, because the appellants have not shown that, compared with verification by ad hoc notaries, lawyer-notarization is superior in detecting and deterring petition fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that the use of ad hoc notaries is not the only feasible safeguard available to the Commission (indeed, the record strongly suggests that notarization may not even be the best means currently employed by the Commission). The Commission checks every petition to ensure that the signature is valid. <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 390. It is in the process of computerizing its voter registration records to include each registered voter's signature. This project is slated for completion later this year, and its completion will enhance the Commission's ability to verify petitions. To accomplish these tasks, the Commission has at its disposal a cadre of people not affiliated with any political party. These nonpartisan workers comprise the so-called Validations Unit, a unit that has the assignment of checking petitions one by one against the Commission's records. The Secretary of the Commission, in answer to a query from the district court, testified that \"it would not be difficult for the Commission to check [new-party] petitions ... against [its] records.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this specialized electoral context, the Commission's in-house verification procedure compares favorably with lawyer-notarization. As the district court found, a lawyer-notary usually verifies a signature by checking a driver's license, a passport, or some other identification document. <i>P&#233;rez-Guzm&#225;n,</i> 260 F.Supp.2d at 391. There is no indication that notaries compare signatures to those appearing on voting records or take steps to ensure that affiants are registered voters. The Commission, it appears, is better positioned than a notary to detect the species of fraud that purportedly justifies the lawyer-notarization requirement. <i>See CAP I,</i> Off. Trans. at 15 (offering as a justification the need to ferret out the \"popular practice of manipulating the voting lists\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. A state is entitled to take a \"belt-and-suspenders\" approach and put in place multiple mechanisms for ensuring the integrity of its electoral processes. Here, however, the record fails to show that lawyer-notarization adds anything over and above other readily available means of verification. Based in part on the absence of evidence that lawyer-notarization reduces electoral fraud and in part on the array of less restrictive alternatives available to the state (including the feasibility of using non-lawyers as ad hoc notaries and the Commission's apparent ability to verify every petition in-house), we find the lawyer-notarization requirement broader than necessary to serve the state's asserted interest. Consequently, the requirement embodied in section 3101(3) cannot survive a First Amendment challenge. <i>See Norman,</i> 502 U.S. at 293-94, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112675\"><a href=\"/opinion/112675/norman-v-reed/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
