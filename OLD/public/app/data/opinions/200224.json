Carmen Consuelo Cerezo, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                   Boudin, Chief Circuit Judge,\n                     Howard, Circuit Judge,\n               and Shadur,* Senior District Judge\n\n\n\n\n     Luis E. Pabon-Roca, with whom Ernesto G. López Soltero was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Claudio Aliff-Ortiz, with whom Pablo Landrau-Pirazzi and\nAldarondo & Lopez Bras were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                        November 27, 2002\n\n\n*Of the Northern District of Illinois, sitting by designation.\n\f           Per Curiam.     This case comes to us after a jury found the\n\nplaintiffs had suffered adverse employment consequences due to\n\ntheir political affiliation.          The defendants-appellants, who are\n\nthe mayor and three other officials of the municipal government of\n\nPeñuelas, Puerto Rico as well as the municipality itself, have\n\nappealed the denial of their post-trial motion for judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.\n\n           The municipal officials were sued in both their official\n\nand individual capacities.       They have not appealed as individuals,\n\nand in fact the monetary judgments below have been satisfied by\n\npayments    on     their    behalf      to      the    plaintiffs-appellees.\n\nConsequently, the parties have agreed that, but for an issue\n\ninvolving reinstatement of one of the plaintiffs, Nelson Castellar\n\nPacheco,   this   appeal   may   be    dismissed      as   moot.      As   to   the\n\nreinstatement of Castellar Pacheco, there has not been an appeal\n\ntaken from the post-trial order granting his reinstatement.                     See\n\nFed. R.    App.   P.   3(c)(1)(B)     (notice   of    appeal   must    designate\n\njudgment or order appealed from).\n\n           Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f",
