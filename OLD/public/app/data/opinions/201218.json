Robert E. Keeton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Bevil Campbell on Request for Certificate of Appealability for\nappellant.\n\n\n\n                             August 25, 2004\n\f            Per      Curiam.     Bevil       Campbell     seeks   a    certificate    of\n\nappealability (\"COA\") to appeal from the district court's denial of\n\nhis motion pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2255.                    Campbell was convicted\n\nfollowing      a   jury   trial    of    conspiracy       to   import      a   controlled\n\nsubstance, aiding and abetting the importation of a controlled\n\nsubstance, and conspiracy to possess a controlled substance with\n\nintent    to       distribute.          He    was    sentenced        to   121    months'\n\nimprisonment, to be followed by 48 months' supervised release. His\n\nconviction and sentence were affirmed on direct appeal. See United\n\nStates v. Campbell, 268 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            Campbell requests a COA to raise on appeal all of the\n\nineffective assistance of trial and appellate counsel claims he\n\nraised in his § 2255 motion. A COA may issue \"only if the applicant\n\nhas made a substantial showing of the denial of a constitutional\n\nright.\"     28 U.S.C. § 2253(c)(2).\n\n             The COA determination under § 2253(c) requires\n             an overview of the claims in the habeas\n             petition and a general assessment of their\n             merits.    We look to the District Court's\n             application    of   AEDPA   to    petitioner's\n             constitutional claims and ask whether that\n             resolution was debatable among jurists of\n             reason.\n\nMiller-El v. Cockrell, 537 U.S. 322, 336 (2003).\n\n            \"To successfully claim ineffective assistance of counsel\n\nunder the Sixth Amendment, a defendant must establish that his\n\ncounsel's      performance        fell       below   an    objective       standard   of\n\nreasonableness and 'that there was a reasonable probability that,\n\n                                             -2-\n\fbut   for    counsel's   unprofessional         errors,       the   results     of   the\n\nproceeding would have been different.'\" United States v. Theodore,\n\n354 F.3d 1, 5-6 (1st Cir. 2003)(quoting Strickland v. Washington,\n\n466 U.S. 668 (1984)).         With regard to the performance aspect of the\n\nstandard, this court has held that it \"demands a fairly tolerant\n\napproach,\" Scarpa v. DuBois, 38 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 1994), and that\n\n\"since even the most celebrated lawyers can differ over trial\n\ntactics in a particular case, a reviewing court must indulge a\n\nstrong presumption that counsel's conduct falls within the wide\n\nrange   of    reasonable      professional       assistance.'\"          Id.    (quoting\n\nStrickland, supra).\n\n              The Supreme Court has held that \"appellate counsel who\n\nfiles   a    merits   brief     need   not     (and    should   not)     raise    every\n\nnonfrivolous claim, but rather may select from among them in order\n\nto maximize the likelihood of success on appeal.\" Smith v. Robbins,\n\n528 U.S. 259, 288 (2000) (citing Jones v. Barnes, 463 U.S. 745\n\n(1983)).      Although it \"is still possible to bring a Strickland\n\nclaim based on counsel's failure to raise a particular claim,\" the\n\nCourt   has    indicated      that     satisfying      the    first     part    of   the\n\nStrickland test requires a showing that the ignored issues were\n\n\"clearly stronger than issues that counsel did present.\" Robbins,\n\n528 U.S. at 288.\n\n              Having thoroughly reviewed the record, including the\n\ntrial   transcripts,       we    agree    with        the    district    court       that\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f\"[o]verwhelmingly,     what    Campbell     asserts    as   errors    are   more\n\nappropriately viewed as strategic decisions with which Campbell, in\n\nhindsight,    disagrees.\"     District    Court's     Memorandum     and   Order,\n\n9/4/02, p. 12. Our overview of Campbell's claims and assessment of\n\ntheir merits leads us, essentially for the reasons stated by the\n\ndistrict court, to find that reasonable jurists could not debate\n\nthe conclusion that Campbell's ineffective assistance claims are\n\nwithout merit.      We add the following comments with respect to\n\ncertain of the claims.\n\n          Campbell faulted his trial counsel for failing to move\n\nfor suppression of derivative evidence for violation of his Fourth\n\nAmendment rights.      However, the district court's finding that\n\nCampbell was \"in custody\" for Fifth Amendment purposes would not\n\nnecessarily dictate a finding that he had been unreasonably seized\n\nfor Fourth Amendment purposes and that all evidence derivative of\n\nthat seizure should be suppressed. See United States v. Newton, 369\n\nF.3d 659, 673 (2d Cir. 2004) (discussing differences between two\n\nstandards).     Moreover, Campbell has failed to make a substantial\n\nshowing that the exclusion of the evidence derived from his seizure\n\nat the airport would likely have resulted in his acquittal.\n\n             Similarly, reasonable jurists could not find a reasonable\n\nprobability that the exclusion of Campbell's statements to customs\n\nofficials at the time of his seizure would have resulted in\n\nacquittal on any of the counts.          In view of the substantial direct\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fevidence of Campbell's involvement in the charged conspiracy, the\n\nstatements have only marginal significance.         Therefore, Campbell\n\nhas not made the requisite showing that defense counsel's cross-\n\nexamination of a government witness which led the court to reverse\n\nits decision to exclude the statements, constituted ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.\n\n           Campbell faults both his trial and appellate counsel for\n\nfailing to argue that the supervised release term violated the rule\n\nof Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), because it \"exceeds\n\nthe term prescribed by 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C).\" § 2255 Motion, p.\n\n34.   However, that statute prescribes a minimum term of supervised\n\nrelease of three years, and no maximum term. See United States v.\n\nLopez, 299 F.3d 84, 90 (1st Cir. 2002), cert. denied, __ U.S. __,\n\n124 S.Ct. 1095 (2004).     Therefore, reasonable jurists could not\n\ndispute that Campbell's attorneys were not ineffective for failing\n\nto challenge the supervised release term on that basis.\n\n           Campbell argues that appellate counsel was deficient for\n\nfailing to challenge the district court's excusal of one of two\n\nblack jurors.   After the close of evidence and prior to closing\n\narguments, the juror had expressed to the clerk her concern that\n\nbecause she \"runs in the same circles\" within the Carribean-\n\nAmerican community   in   Boston   as    the   defendant,   she   might   be\n\nrecognized by Campbell's family and friends as a juror on his case.\n\nAfter a colloquy between the court, counsel and the juror, the\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fcourt supportably found that the juror \"is genuinely concerned\n\nabout her safety and that that would interfere with her being open\n\nand   candid   and   participating    with   the   other   jurors   in   the\n\ndeliberations in the case.\"\n\n           Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, \"[t]he\n\ncourt may impanel up to 6 alternate jurors to replace any jurors\n\nwho are unable to perform or who are disqualified from performing\n\ntheir duties.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c)(1) (emphasis added).         The court\n\nhas substantial discretion in decisions to excuse jurors. See\n\nUnited States v. Gonzalez-Soberal, 109 F.3d 64, 66 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nA judge may remove a juror \"when 'convinced that the juror's\n\nabilities to perform his duties [have] become impaired.'\" United\n\nStates v. Walsh, 75 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1996).      Here, the transcript\n\nof the voir dire with the juror supports the judge's finding that\n\nthe juror's fear would impair her ability to perform her duties.\n\nThere is no suggestion from the record, and Campbell does not\n\nallege, that the juror was excused because of her race.             And the\n\nfact that there was only one juror of the defendant's race on the\n\njury, standing alone, is not ground for reversal. \"[A] defendant\n\nhas no right to a 'petit jury composed in whole or in part of\n\npersons of his own race.'\" Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79, 85\n\n(quoting Strauder v. West Virginia, 100 U.S. 303, 305 (1880)).\n\nTherefore, reasonable jurists could not find that this issue was\n\nclearly stronger than those presented by appellate counsel.\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f            Finally, Campbell is not entitled to a COA to pursue the\n\nclaim that counsel was ineffective for failing to anticipate the\n\nCourt's decision in Blakely v. Washington, ___ U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct.\n\n2531 (2004).    On appeal, this court held that there was no Apprendi\n\nviolation    because   Campbell   was    sentenced   below   the   statutory\n\nmaximum of 240 months. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C).          In his § 2255\n\nmotion, Campbell argued that appellate counsel should have argued\n\nthat Apprendi was violated because Campbell's base offense level\n\nunder the sentencing guidelines was enhanced based on the drug\n\nquantity.    He has now filed an addendum to his COA memorandum in\n\nwhich he asks that Blakely \"be applied in evaluating the arguments\n\nwhich he has placed before the court.\" Notice of Supplemental\n\nAuthority, p. 1.\n\n            This case does not require us to decide whether Blakely\n\napplies to the federal sentencing guidelines or whether it applies\n\nretroactively to cases on collateral review.             Because Campbell\n\nstipulated at trial to a drug quantity that corresponded to the\n\nbase offense level used to calculate his sentence, he cannot show\n\nthat he was prejudiced by the failure to charge the specific drug\n\nquantity in his indictment. See United States v. Riggs, 347 F.3d\n\n17, 20 (1st Cir. 2003), cert. denied, __ U.S.__, 124 S.Ct. 1095\n\n(2004).     Moreover, counsel's failure to anticipate Blakely would\n\nnot constitute unreasonable performance under Strickland because\n\n\"First    Circuit   jurisprudence   on    this   point   ha[d]     been   well\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\festablished.\" Campbell, 268 F.3d at 7, n.7.   Therefore, reasonable\n\njurists could not find that he has made a substantial showing that\n\nthe Blakely issue would have been clearly stronger than the issues\n\nraised by appellate counsel.1\n\n          Campbell's request to proceed IFP is granted, but his\n\nrequest for a COA is denied.    The appeal is terminated.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       To the extent that petitioner is seeking to assert a new\nclaim based on Blakely (rather than to provide supplemental support\nfor his ineffective assistance claim), he would be required to\npresent that claim first in the district court. Certification to\nfile a second or successive petition could not be granted unless\nthe Supreme Court had held that Blakely applied retroactively to\ncases on collateral review. 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

In view of the substantial direct\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fevidence of Campbell's involvement in the charged conspiracy, the\n\nstatements have only marginal significance.         Therefore, Campbell\n\nhas not made the requisite showing that defense counsel's cross-\n\nexamination of a government witness which led the court to reverse\n\nits decision to exclude the statements, constituted ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel.\n\n           Campbell faults both his trial and appellate counsel for\n\nfailing to argue that the supervised release term violated the rule\n\nof Apprendi v.

However, that statute prescribes a minimum term of supervised\n\nrelease of three years, and no maximum term.

Therefore, reasonable jurists could not\n\ndispute that Campbell's attorneys were not ineffective for failing\n\nto challenge the supervised release term on that basis.\n\n           Campbell argues that appellate counsel was deficient for\n\nfailing to challenge the district court's excusal of one of two\n\nblack jurors.   After the close of evidence and prior to closing\n\narguments, the juror had expressed to the clerk her concern that\n\nbecause she \"runs in the same circles\" within the Carribean-\n\nAmerican community   in   Boston   as    the   defendant,   she   might   be\n\nrecognized by Campbell's family and friends as a juror on his case.\n\nAfter a colloquy between the court, counsel and the juror, the\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fcourt supportably found that the juror \"is genuinely concerned\n\nabout her safety and that that would interfere with her being open\n\nand   candid   and   participating    with   the   other   jurors   in   the\n\ndeliberations in the case.\"\n\n           Under the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, \"[t]he\n\ncourt may impanel up to 6 alternate jurors to replace any jurors\n\nwho are unable to perform or who are disqualified from performing\n\ntheir duties.\" Fed.R.Crim.P. 24(c)(1) (emphasis added).         The court\n\nhas substantial discretion in decisions to excuse jurors. See\n\nUnited States v. Gonzalez-Soberal, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197260\"><a href=\"/opinion/197260/united-states-v-gonzalez-soberal/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">64</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 66 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\nA judge may remove a juror \"when 'convinced that the juror's\n\nabilities to perform his duties [have] become impaired.'\" United\n\nStates v.

Here, the transcript\n\nof the voir dire with the juror supports the judge's finding that\n\nthe juror's fear would impair her ability to perform her duties.\n\nThere is no suggestion from the record, and Campbell does not\n\nallege, that the juror was excused because of her race.             And the\n\nfact that there was only one juror of the defendant's race on the\n\njury, standing alone, is not ground for reversal. \"[A] defendant\n\nhas no right to a 'petit jury composed in whole or in part of\n\npersons of his own race.'\" Batson v.

On appeal, this court held that there was no Apprendi\n\nviolation    because   Campbell   was    sentenced   below   the   statutory\n\nmaximum of 240 months. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C).          In his § 2255\n\nmotion, Campbell argued that appellate counsel should have argued\n\nthat Apprendi was violated because Campbell's base offense level\n\nunder the sentencing guidelines was enhanced based on the drug\n\nquantity.    He has now filed an addendum to his COA memorandum in\n\nwhich he asks that Blakely \"be applied in evaluating the arguments\n\nwhich he has placed before the court.\" Notice of Supplemental\n\nAuthority, p. 1.\n\n            This case does not require us to decide whether Blakely\n\napplies to the federal sentencing guidelines or whether it applies\n\nretroactively to cases on collateral review.             Because Campbell\n\nstipulated at trial to a drug quantity that corresponded to the\n\nbase offense level used to calculate his sentence, he cannot show\n\nthat he was prejudiced by the failure to charge the specific drug\n\nquantity in his indictment. See United States v.

Moreover, counsel's failure to anticipate Blakely would\n\nnot constitute unreasonable performance under Strickland because\n\n\"First    Circuit   jurisprudence   on    this   point   ha[d]     been   well\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\festablished.\" Campbell, 268 F.3d at 7, n.7.   Therefore, reasonable\n\njurists could not find that he has made a substantial showing that\n\nthe Blakely issue would have been clearly stronger than the issues\n\nraised by appellate counsel.1\n\n          Campbell's request to proceed IFP is granted, but his\n\nrequest for a COA is denied.    The appeal is terminated.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       To the extent that petitioner is seeking to assert a new\nclaim based on Blakely (rather than to provide supplemental support\nfor his ineffective assistance claim), he would be required to\npresent that claim first in the district court.
