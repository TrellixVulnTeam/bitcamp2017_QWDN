As one observer has noted, this\n\ncase, which raises important and unsettled legal issues under the\n\nVisual Artists Rights Act (\"VARA\"), may well serve as \"the ultimate\n\nhow-not-to guide in the complicated world of installation art.\"\n\nGeoff Edgers, Dismantled, The Boston Globe, Oct.                 21, 2007, at 1N.\n\nArtist Christoph Büchel conceived of an ambitious, football-field-\n\nsized art installation entitled \"Training Ground for Democracy,\"\n\nwhich       was    to    be   exhibited   at    the   Massachusetts    Museum    of\n\nContemporary Art (\"MASS MoCA,\" or \"the Museum\").                  Unfortunately,\n\nthe parties never memorialized the terms of their relationship or\n\ntheir understanding of the intellectual property issues involved in\n\nthe installation in a written agreement.                Even more unfortunately,\n\nthe project was never completed. Numerous conflicts and a steadily\n\ndeteriorating           relationship   between    the   artist   and   the   Museum\n\nprevented the completion of \"Training Ground for Democracy\" in its\n\nfinal form.\n\n                  In the wake of this failed endeavor, the Museum went to\n\nfederal court seeking a declaration that it was \"entitled to\n\npresent to the public the materials and partial constructions\" it\n\nhad   collected         for   \"Training   Ground      for   Democracy.\"      Büchel\n\nresponded with several counterclaims under VARA and the Copyright\n\nAct,1 seeking an injunction that would prevent MASS MoCA from\n\n\n\n        1\n       VARA was enacted as an amendment to the Copyright Act.                   See\ninfra Section II.\n\n                                          -2-\n\fdisplaying the unfinished installation and damages for the Museum's\n\nalleged violations of his rights under both VARA and the general\n\nCopyright Act.\n\n           On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court\n\nassumed that VARA applies to unfinished works of art, but it\n\nnonetheless ruled for the Museum in all respects because, even\n\ngranting VARA's applicability, it found no genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact.   Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art Found.,\n\nInc. v. Büchel, 565 F. Supp. 2d 245 (D. Mass. 2008).         Büchel\n\nappeals.   Because we find that, if VARA applies, genuine issues of\n\nmaterial fact would foreclose summary judgment on one of Büchel's\n\nVARA claims – that MASS MoCA violated his right of artistic\n\nintegrity by modifying the installation – we cannot assume that\n\nVARA applies to unfinished works but instead must decide its\n\napplicability.   We conclude that the statute does apply to such\n\nworks.\n\n           We further conclude that, in addition to his VARA claim,\n\nBüchel asserts a viable claim under the Copyright Act that MASS\n\nMoCA violated his exclusive right to display his work publicly.\n\nAccordingly, we reverse in part the grant of summary judgment for\n\nMASS MoCA and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n                                -3-\n\f                                             I.\n\nA. The Parties\n\n           MASS MoCA opened in 1999 as a center for the creation and\n\ndisplay of contemporary art.                The Museum \"seeks to catalyze and\n\nsupport the creation of new art, expose [its] visitors to bold\n\nvisual   and   performing         art   in    all    stages    of       production,       and\n\nre-invigorate       the    life    of   a    region    in     socioeconomic          need.\"\n\nMassachusetts       Museum    of    Contemporary       Art,       Mission        Statement,\n\nhttp://www.massmoca.org/mission.php (last visited Jan. 13, 2010).\n\nIn its expansive facility in North Adams, Massachusetts, the Museum\n\nstrives to \"make the whole cloth of art making, presentation and\n\npublic participation a seamless continuum.\"                       Id.     Over the last\n\ndecade, the Museum has hosted the production and presentation of\n\nover sixty exhibits of visual art, including over 600 works of art\n\nby more than 250 individual artists.                Some of these works have been\n\ndisplayed in Building 5, the Museum's signature exhibition space,\n\nwhich spans the length of a football field.                   The Museum strives to\n\n\"offer visual artists the tools and time to create works of a scale\n\nand duration impossible to realize in the time and space-cramped\n\nconditions     of   most     museums,\"       and    MASS   MoCA     prides       itself    on\n\nexposing     its    audiences      to       \"all    stages    of     art     production:\n\nrehearsals, sculptural fabrication, and developmental workshops are\n\nfrequently on view, as are finished works of art.\"                         Id.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\f            Christoph Büchel is a Swiss visual artist who lives and\n\nworks in Basel, Switzerland.       He is \"known for building elaborate,\n\npolitically provocative environments for viewers to wander, and\n\nsometimes to crawl, through.\"       Randy Kennedy, The Show Will Go On,\n\nbut the Art Will Be Shielded, N.Y. Times, May 22, 2007, at E1 (\"The\n\nShow Will Go On\").          One critic has stated that \"Mr. Büchel's\n\nenvironments are huge in scale,\" \"like bristling three-dimensional\n\nhistory paintings,\" yet are \"so obsessively detailed that they\n\nmight best be described as panoramic collage.\"              Roberta Smith, Is\n\nIt Art Yet? And Who Decides?, N.Y. Times, Sept. 16, 2007, at 21.\n\nB. Factual Background\n\n            Focusing first on those facts that are undisputed, we\n\nsketch the course of dealings between Büchel and MASS MoCA to put\n\nthis appeal in context.2       MASS MoCA became interested in planning\n\na new installation with Büchel. The artist visited the North Adams\n\nfacility in October 2005 to begin preliminary discussions regarding\n\nthe project, and those discussions continued into 2006.                  At some\n\npoint during this time, Büchel proposed, and the Museum agreed to,\n\na project entitled \"Training Ground for Democracy.\"                    As Museum\n\nDirector Joseph Thompson indicated in a letter to Büchel's gallery\n\nrepresentatives,   MASS     MoCA   understood       that   \"Büchel's    projects\n\ntypically    require    a     lengthy      period     of    installation     and\n\n\n     2\n       We consider the parties' conflicting accounts of the key\nevidence in our summary judgment analysis, infra.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fpreparation,\" and that, given the gallery space of Building 5,\n\n\"this     project       [would]    be   his        largest     venture      to    date.\"\n\n            Büchel       conceived      of    the    exhibit      as    \"essentially       a\n\nvillage,    .   .   .    contain[ing]        several      major    architectural       and\n\nstructural elements integrated into a whole, through which a\n\nvisitor    could    walk    (and    climb).\"          According        to   an    affidavit\n\nsubmitted to the district court, Büchel envisioned the work in the\n\nfollowing way:\n\n            It was to adopt the role-play of U.S. military\n            training for its visitors, who would be given\n            the opportunity to \"virtually\" change their\n            own various identities in relation to the\n            collective    project   called    \"democracy\":\n            training to be an immigrant, training to vote,\n            protest, and revolt, training to loot,\n            training iconoclasm, training to join a\n            political rally, training to be the objects of\n            propaganda, training to be interrogated and\n            detained and to be tried or to judge, training\n            to reconstruct a disaster, training to be in\n            conditions of suspended law, and training\n            various other social and political behavior.\n\n            In August 2006, Büchel spent ten days in residence at\n\nMASS MoCA.      During this time, he and a partner prepared a basic\n\nschematic model of the proposed installation.                     MASS MoCA agreed to\n\nacquire, at Büchel's direction but its own expense, the materials\n\nand items necessary for the project.\n\n            Unfortunately, the parties never formalized the contours\n\nof their relationship or firmly established the project's financial\n\nscope     and   precise      specifications          by      executing      any    written\n\ninstrument.         Although MASS MoCA's curator, Nato Thompson (no\n\n                                             -6-\n\frelation to the Museum Director),3 sent Büchel's gallery sales\n\nrepresentative in the United States a letter on September 14, 2006\n\nthat was designed to \"formalize [the parties'] relationship on this\n\nproject,\" there is no indication that Büchel himself ever saw, much\n\nless signed, this proposal.4    The gallery responded with a proposed\n\ncontract of its own, providing that MASS MoCA should bear the costs\n\nof transporting and organizing the various materials for the\n\ninstallation.    The   Museum   did   not   respond   to   this   proposal.\n\nAdditionally, it is undisputed that Büchel never signed a document\n\nwaiving any rights to which he would otherwise be entitled under\n\nVARA.    The parties did apparently agree, however, that once the\n\nplanned installation was finished, and after the public exhibition\n\nperiod had concluded, MASS MoCA would not contest Büchel's sole\n\ntitle to any copyright in the completed work.         The parties set an\n\nopening date of December 16, 2006 for the exhibit.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       Throughout the opinion, any reference to \"Thompson\" without\na first name will refer to Museum Director Joseph Thompson. Nato\nThompson will be identified by his full name.\n     4\n       The letter, signed by Museum Director Joseph Thompson, was\nattached to an email sent by Nato Thompson. The proposal did not\nlay out a definitive budget for the project, although in a separate\nletter to Büchel the following day, Joseph Thompson stated \"we\nthink we've got a $160,000 project on our hands in direct costs.\"\nIn a reply email dated September 24, 2006, Büchel did not\nexplicitly agree to or reject the $160,000 figure, but suggested\nthat MASS MoCA get in touch with his two galleries, which might\nprovide information regarding \"potential sponsors like foundations\"\nfor the installation.\n\n                                  -7-\n\f             Over the course of the fall, tensions began to develop\n\nbetween the artist and MASS MoCA employees, particularly Joseph\n\nThompson.     \"In summary, the museum felt the artist's directions\n\nwere   vague,    and    his   financial     and   logistical      demands   were\n\nincreasingly        unreasonable;   the     artist   felt   the    museum    was\n\ncompromising his artistic integrity and failing to follow his\n\ninstructions.\"        MASS MoCA, 565 F. Supp. 2d at 247.          One frequent\n\nsource of conflict between the parties was the budget, with the\n\nMuseum understandably concerned about keeping its costs for the\n\nmassive project under control, and Büchel understandably insistent\n\nthat his vision for \"Training Ground\" be fully realized.                But as\n\nthe district court correctly noted, \"[t]he dispute about these\n\nfinancial understandings is not material\" to whether Büchel has\n\npresented triable claims under either VARA or the Copyright Act,\n\nid. at 250, and we therefore need not focus on its messy details.\n\n             Instead, for our purposes, the key conflict between MASS\n\nMoCA and the artist involved Büchel's dissatisfaction with the way\n\nin   which    the    Museum   was   implementing     his    instructions    and\n\nprocuring the items necessary for the installation. Büchel himself\n\nwas not present in North Adams for the first several months of work\n\non the project.        Instead, he conducted much of his work on the\n\ninstallation throughout the fall of 2006 remotely, by providing\n\nMuseum personnel with detailed instructions as to the particular\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fmaterials he required and their placement within the exhibition\n\nspace.\n\n           In the words of the district court, \"[a]t various points\n\nin the development of the installation, Büchel proposed several\n\nmajor components,\" some but not all of which later became part of\n\nthe installation \"as its elements evolved through discussions with\n\nMASS MoCA during the construction process.\"              Id.     These major\n\ncomponents included a movie theater, a house, a bar, a mobile home,\n\nvarious sea containers, a bomb carousel, and an aircraft fuselage.\n\nId.   The Museum had begun seeking out some of these materials and\n\nothers for potential use in the installation as soon as Büchel left\n\nNorth Adams at the end of August 2006, and continued to do so\n\nthroughout the fall.       One of the Museum's curators described the\n\nsearch for these items (at Büchel's direction) as \"the ultimate\n\nscavenger hunt.\"   However, problems soon arose, especially between\n\nThompson   and   Büchel,    as   to    the   progress    of    the     project,\n\nparticularly when, as Thompson explained in an internal Museum\n\nemail dated October 28, 2006, he had tried to \"move the project\n\nalong\" by \"making a few decisions in [Büchel's] stead.\"                Thompson\n\nnoted that Büchel, whom he described as having \"clear vision\" and\n\n\"rock solid integrity,\" had taken \"extreme, mortal[] offense\" to\n\nThompson's efforts.\n\n           On October 29, 2006, Büchel returned to North Adams to\n\ncomplete   \"Training   Ground    for    Democracy,\"     and    three    of   his\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fassistants from Switzerland arrived shortly thereafter.            Unhappy\n\nwith some of the work that had been done by the Museum in his\n\nabsence, Büchel felt that certain logistical and organizational\n\nfailures by the Museum had endangered the timely opening of the\n\nshow.    Büchel wrote in an email to Thompson that he would not allow\n\nthe Museum to open an \"unfinished show in my name, since you are\n\nresponsible for this major delay.\"        By early December 2006, Büchel\n\ninsisted that the Museum postpone the opening of the show and\n\nasserted that he would not \"accept an opening of a work in progress\n\nor other compromise.\"       During the first week of the month, MASS\n\nMoCA agreed to delay the opening, posting the following message on\n\nits website: \"Due to logistical complexities encountered by the\n\nmuseum    in    preparing   galleries     for   Christoph   Büchel's   vast\n\ninstallation, the exhibition's official opening date . . . will be\n\nre-scheduled.\"\n\n            Büchel remained onsite at the Museum working on \"Training\n\nGround\" until December 17, 2006, when he left for the holidays.         In\n\nBüchel's estimation, \"Training Ground\" was then only about 40%\n\ncomplete.      At the time, he planned to return on January 8, 2007, in\n\norder to finish the work in time for a March 3 opening.            When he\n\nleft North Adams, the artist was obviously disappointed with the\n\nprogress of \"Training Ground.\"      He called the Museum disorganized\n\nand faulted it for underestimating the scope of his project.            He\n\nfelt that Museum employees, by failing to precisely carry out his\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fdetailed instructions and making artistic decisions in his stead,\n\nhad generated even more work for his crew, as numerous components\n\nof the installation had to be reworked to Büchel's specifications.\n\nIn general, he felt that the Museum was trying to scale back his\n\nartistic vision without consulting him.\n\n           Meanwhile, the Museum was running out of money for the\n\nproject.   In an attempt to secure further funding, it disregarded\n\nBüchel's express wishes and, in late December 2006, asked for money\n\nfrom his galleries. Angry and frustrated, the artist wrote that he\n\nwould not move forward with the installation until \"all financial\n\nproblems are solved, regarding ALL elements of the show and until\n\nmy crew is being sure that they [are] getting paid.\"                By mid-\n\nJanuary 2007, tensions had escalated to the point where Büchel\n\ninformed the Museum that he would not return to continue work on\n\n\"Training Ground\" unless certain conditions, both financial and\n\nartistic, were met.\n\n           In Büchel's absence, MASS MoCA staff continued to work on\n\nthe installation. The parties disagree as to whether the employees\n\nwere merely executing instructions left by the artist or whether\n\ntheir actions represented independent artistic judgment, exercised\n\nin direct contravention of Büchel's express wishes.             The parties\n\nalso   disagree   as   to   whether,   in   the   spring   of   2007,   while\n\nnegotiations had stalled but work on the installation was ongoing,\n\nthe Museum promoted - and even showed - the unfinished work to\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fnumerous visitors without Büchel's consent, in one form or another.\n\n           As the vitriolic exchanges between the parties continued,\n\nand negotiations over the project's eventual completion became\n\nhopeless, \"Training Ground\" languished in its unfinished state. It\n\nbecame clear that Büchel would not complete the installation.                      On\n\nMay 22, 2007, MASS MoCA announced the cancellation of \"Training\n\nGround,\" and contemporaneously publicized the opening of a new\n\nexhibit   entitled    \"Made     at    MASS    MoCA,\"   which    was     to   be    \"a\n\ndocumentary project exploring the issues raised in the course of\n\ncomplex collaborative projects between artists and institutions.\"\n\nMassachusetts    Museum       of     Contemporary      Art,     Press    Release,\n\nPresentation    of   Training      Ground     for   Democracy   Cancelled;        New\n\nExhibition, Made at MASS MoCA, to Open on Saturday, May 26 (\"Press\n\nR e l e a s e \" ) ,                     a v a i l a b l e                         a t\n\nhttp://www.massmoca.org/event_details.php?id=144 (May 22, 2007).\n\nThe press release noted that this lawsuit had been filed the\n\nprevious day; it also highlighted the Museum's desire to use its\n\n\"other experiences working with artists\" to \"provide [its] audience\n\nwith thought-provoking insights into the complexities of the art-\n\nmaking process.\"     Id.   The release further explained that, due to\n\n\"space constraints imposed by the materials assembled for Training\n\nGround for Democracy,\" the exhibition would be presented in the\n\nMuseum's \"only remaining available gallery space\"; therefore, in\n\norder to enter the exhibit, visitors would have to pass through\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fBuilding 5, \"housing the materials and unfinished fabrications that\n\nwere to have comprised elements of Training Ground for Democracy.\"\n\nId.   The Museum represented that \"[r]easonable steps [had] been\n\ntaken to control and restrict the view of these materials, pending\n\na court ruling.\"\n\n          When \"Made at MASS MoCA\" opened, many in the art world\n\ndisagreed with the Museum's handling of its dispute with Büchel,\n\nthough the parties have different views on whether the Museum's\n\nactions ultimately tarnished the artist's reputation.    Moreover,\n\nthe parties differ on whether the \"reasonable steps . . . taken to\n\ncontrol and restrict the view of the[] materials\" – the placement\n\nof yellow tarpaulins over the unfinished work – actually concealed\n\nall of the individual components and vital design elements of\n\n\"Training Ground,\" or whether the tarpaulins simply \"hid[] an\n\nelephant behind a napkin,\" effectively inviting individuals to peek\n\nbehind the cloth coverings and view the unfinished work.

Procedural Background\n\n          The Museum sued Büchel on May 21, 2007, in the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Massachusetts.       The\n\ncomplaint asserted a single claim for declaratory relief under\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fVARA.     The Museum sought a declaration that it was \"entitled to\n\npresent to the public the materials and partial constructions\n\nassembled in connection with an exhibit planned with the Swiss\n\nartist Büchel.\"      Büchel responded by asserting five counterclaims\n\nagainst the Museum. The first sought a declaratory judgment and an\n\ninjunction       under   VARA   prohibiting     the    Museum    from    publicly\n\ndisplaying \"the unfinished Work of Art or any of its component\n\nelements.\"       The second sought damages for MASS MoCA's alleged\n\nviolations of Büchel's VARA rights by \"intentionally distort[ing]\n\nand modif[ying] the Work of Art\" and allowing members of the public\n\nto \"see and pass through\" the unfinished work, both with and\n\nwithout    the    yellow    tarpaulins.       The   third,   fourth     and   fifth\n\ncounterclaims      sought    damages   and    injunctive     relief     under   the\n\nCopyright Act based on alleged violations of Büchel's right to\n\npublicly display and create derivative works from his work.\n\n            On MASS MoCA's motion, the court ordered an expedited\n\ndiscovery schedule that included a private viewing by the district\n\ncourt of Building 5 and the unfinished installation.                    After the\n\nclose of discovery, both sides filed cross-motions seeking summary\n\njudgment on the complaint and all counterclaims.                On September 21,\n\n2007, the court held oral argument on the cross-motions and ruled\n\nfrom the bench. That decision addressed only the Museum's original\n\ncomplaint seeking declaratory relief to allow public display of the\n\npartially completed project and Büchel's corresponding counterclaim\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fseeking to prevent the Museum from showing the then-existing work.\n\nThe court ruled in favor of the Museum, noting that nothing in VARA\n\nprevented     MASS     MoCA   from   showing     the     incomplete     project.\n\nTherefore, MASS MoCA was \"entitled to present\" the unfinished\n\ninstallation to the public as long as it posted a disclaimer that\n\nwould   \"inform      anyone   viewing    the   exhibit   that    the   materials\n\nassembled in Building 5 constitute an unfinished project that [did]\n\nnot carry out the installation's original intent.\"                     The court\n\ncorrespondingly denied the artist's request for injunctive relief\n\nbarring public display of the unfinished installation, ruling that\n\nhe had failed to prove a likelihood of success on the merits of his\n\nVARA claim.    The court stated that it would \"in the coming weeks\"\n\nissue   a   detailed    memorandum      explaining     its   oral   rulings   and\n\naddressing the remaining claims.\n\n            However, several days after obtaining the ruling in its\n\nfavor, MASS MoCA changed course. The Museum posted an announcement\n\non its website stating that it had \"begun removing materials\n\ngathered for Training Ground for Democracy and [would] not permit\n\nthe public to enter the planned installation.\"                  MASS MoCA Blog,\n\n\" W e ' l l          R e m o v e         T r a i n i n g         G r o u n d , \"\n\nhttp://blog.massmoca.org/2007/09/28/well-remove-training-ground/\n\n(Sept. 28, 2007) (last visited Jan. 13, 2010).\n\n            On July 11, 2008, the district court issued its written\n\nopinion, recognizing that some of the issues presented in the case\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fwere now moot, but nevertheless wishing to explain its holding and\n\nto address the VARA and Copyright Act claims remaining in the case.\n\nThe court summarized its holding this way:\n\n          When an artist makes a decision to begin work\n          on a piece of art and handles the process of\n          creation long-distance via e-mail, using\n          someone   else's   property,  someone   else's\n          materials, someone else's money, someone\n          else's staff, and, to a significant extent,\n          someone else's suggestions regarding the\n          details of fabrication – with no enforceable\n          written or oral contract defining the parties'\n          relationship – and that artist becomes unhappy\n          part-way through the project and abandons it,\n          then nothing in the Visual Artists Rights Act\n          or elsewhere in the Copyright Act gives that\n          artist the right to dictate what that \"someone\n          else\" does with what he has left behind, so\n          long as the remnant is not explicitly labeled\n          as the artist's work.    No right of artistic\n          \"attribution\" or \"integrity,\" as those terms\n          are conceived by VARA, is implicated, let\n          alone   violated    in  these   circumstances.\n          Similarly, the Copyright Act provides no\n          mechanism for relief, legal or equitable, to\n          an artist such as Defendant Büchel here, based\n          on the decision of an exhibitor such as\n          Plaintiff MASS MoCA to allow patrons to walk\n          past covered components of an unfinished\n          installation.\n\n565 F. Supp. 2d at 248-29.   The court therefore granted MASS MoCA's\n\nmotion for summary judgment and denied Büchel's, entering judgment\n\nfor the Museum on its claim for declaratory relief as well as on\n\nall five of Büchel's counterclaims.    Büchel appeals.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          Passed in 1990, the Visual Artists Rights Act, 17 U.S.C.\n\n§ 106A, was an amendment to the Copyright Act that protects the\n\n\n                                -16-\n\f\"moral rights\" of certain visual artists in the works they create,\n\nconsistent with Article 6bis of the Berne Convention.   Phillips v.\n\nPembroke Real Estate, Inc., 459 F.3d 128, 133 (1st Cir. 2006);\n\nCarter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc., 71 F.3d 77, 83 (2d Cir. 1995)\n\n(citing H.R. Rep. No. 101-514, at 5 (1990) (\"House Report\"), as\n\nreprinted in 1990 U.S.S.C.A.N. 6915, 6917).5   The \"rubric of moral\n\nrights encompasses many varieties of rights,\" but the two most\n\nwidely recognized are attribution and integrity. Id. at 81 (citing\n\nRalph E. Lerner & Judith Bresler, Art Law 417, 420 (1989)).      We\n\nwill discuss both of these in detail below, but note briefly now\n\nthat the right of attribution protects the author's right to be\n\nidentified as the author of his work and also protects against the\n\nuse of his name in connection with works created by others.     Id.\n\nThe right of integrity \"allows the author to prevent any deforming\n\nor mutilating changes to his work.\"    Id.     Although these moral\n\nrights \"exist independent[ly] of the economic rights\" granted to\n\nall authors under the Copyright Act, 5 William F. Patry, Patry on\n\nCopyright § 16:1 (2009), they are part of the same statutory\n\nframework.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      The Berne convention, developed at the instigation of Victor\nHugo and first adopted in Berne, Switzerland in 1886, is \"'an\ninternational copyright treaty providing that works created by\ncitizens of one signatory nation will be fully protected in other\nsignatory nations, without the need for local formalities.'\"\nPhillips, 459 F.3d at 133 n.3 (quoting Black's Law Dictionary, 8th\ned. (1999)).\n\n                              -17-\n\fA. The Copyright Act\n\n            Under the Copyright Act, \"[c]opyright protection subsists\n\n. . . in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium\n\nof expression.\"      17 U.S.C. § 102(a).   A copyright owner has certain\n\nexclusive rights to the work, which are enumerated in 17 U.S.C.\n\n§ 106.    T-Peg, Inc. v. Vermont Timber Works, Inc., 459 F.3d 97, 108\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).      Of particular relevance to this litigation, the\n\ncopyright holder has the exclusive right to publicly display the\n\ncopyrighted work and to prepare derivative works based upon it. 17\n\nU.S.C. § 106(5), (2).       \"One infringes a copyright when he or she\n\nviolates one of the exclusive rights to a work held by a copyright\n\nowner, and the owner has the right to sue for infringement.\"\n\nT-Peg, Inc., 459 F.3d at 108 (citing 17 U.S.C. § 501).                 The\n\nremedies provided by the Copyright Act include injunctive relief\n\nand actual or statutory damages.        See 17 U.S.C. §§ 502, 504.6\n\nB. VARA\n\n            Beyond    the   Copyright   Act's   protections   of   certain\n\neconomic    rights,     VARA   provides    additional   and   independent\n\n\n\n     6\n       Under the Copyright Act, a plaintiff may elect to recover\nstatutory damages instead of actual damages for each work infringed\n\"in a sum of not less than $750 or more than $30,000 as the court\nconsiders just.\" 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1). If the copyright owner\nproves that the infringement was committed willfully, the court \"in\nits discretion\" may increase the award of statutory damages to \"a\nsum of not more than $150,000.\" Id. at 504(c)(2). The award may\nalso be reduced to $200 if the infringer proves that he or she was\nnot aware \"and had no reason to believe that his or her acts\nconstituted an infringement of copyright.\" Id.\n\n                                   -18-\n\fprotections to authors of works of visual art.    See Carter, 71 F.3d\n\nat 81-83.   A work of visual art is defined to include \"a painting,\n\ndrawing, print, or sculpture,7 existing in a single copy\" or in a\n\nlimited edition.    17 U.S.C. § 101.     The definition specifically\n\nexcludes a number of works that are otherwise copyrightable,\n\nincluding motion pictures and other audiovisual works, books,\n\nposters, periodicals, works made for hire, and merchandising,\n\nadvertising, promotional, or packaging materials.        Id.\n\n            VARA provides that, in addition to the exclusive rights\n\nprovided by section 106 of the Copyright Act, but subject to\n\ncertain limitations, the author of a work of visual art\n\n            (1) shall have the right —\n\n                 (A) to claim   authorship   of   that\n                 work, and\n\n                 (B) to prevent the use of his or her\n                 name as the author of any work of\n                 visual art which he or she did not\n                 create;\n\n            (2) shall have the right to prevent the use of\n            his or her name as the author of the work of\n\n\n     7\n       The parties do not dispute that, if completed, \"Training\nGround for Democracy\" would have been a sculpture and therefore a\nqualified \"work of visual art\" under VARA. Furthermore, VARA's\nlegislative history states that \"[t]he term 'sculpture' includes,\nbut is not limited to, castings, carvings, modelings, and\nconstructions.\" House Report at 11 (1990), as reprinted in 1990\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 6921 (emphasis added).     The Second Circuit in\nCarter similarly considered VARA's application to a \"very large\n'walk-through sculpture' occupying most, but not all, of [a]\nbuilding's lobby.\" 71 F.3d at 80; see also id. at 84 (\"Concededly,\nconsidered as a whole, the work is a sculpture and exists only in\na single copy.\").\n\n                                -19-\n\f             visual art in the event of a distortion,\n             mutilation, or other modification of the work\n             which would be prejudicial to his or her honor\n             or reputation; and\n\n             (3) subject to the limitations set forth in\n             section 113(d), shall have the right —\n\n                    (A) to prevent any intentional\n                    distortion, mutilation, or other\n                    modification of that work which\n                    would be prejudicial to his or her\n                    honor   or   reputation,  and   any\n                    intentional distortion, mutilation,\n                    or modification of that work is a\n                    violation of that right, and\n\n                    (B) to prevent any destruction of a\n                    work of recognized stature, and any\n                    intentional or grossly negligent\n                    destruction of that work is a\n                    violation of that right.\n\n17 U.S.C. § 106A(a).\n\n             VARA's passage reflected Congress's belief that the art\n\ncovered by the Act \"meet[s] a special societal need, and [its]\n\nprotection and preservation serve an important public interest.\"\n\nHouse Report at 5-6, as reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915-16.\n\nTo encourage the creation of such art, VARA protects the \"moral\n\nrights\" of its creators.           These are \"rights of a spiritual, non-\n\neconomic and personal nature\" that exist \"independently of an\n\nartist's copyright in his or her work\" and \"spring from a belief\n\nthat an artist in the process of creation injects his spirit into\n\nthe   work   and    that   the     artist's    personality,     as   well   as   the\n\nintegrity     of    the    work,    should     therefore   be    protected       and\n\npreserved.\"        Carter, 71 F.3d at 81.          The recognition of moral\n\n                                        -20-\n\frights     fosters    a   \"'climate   of   artistic   worth   and   honor   that\n\nencourages the author in the arduous act of creation.'\"              Id. at 83\n\n(quoting House Report at 6, as reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at\n\n6915).     Although an artist may not transfer his VARA rights (as\n\nthey are considered an extension of his personality), he may waive\n\nthose rights by \"expressly agree[ing] to such waiver in a written\n\ninstrument.\"         17 U.S.C. § 106A(e)(1).          Also, \"[a]ll remedies\n\navailable under copyright law, other than criminal remedies, are\n\navailable in an action for infringement of moral rights.\"              Carter,\n\n71 F.3d at 83 (citing 17 U.S.C. § 506); see also 17 U.S.C. §\n\n501(a).8\n\n             More specifically, by guaranteeing the moral rights of\n\n\"attribution\" and \"integrity,\" VARA \"'protects both the reputations\n\nof certain visual artists and the works of art they create.'\"\n\nCarter, 71 F.3d at 83 (quoting House Report at 6, as reprinted in\n\n1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915). Before discussing the precise contours\n\nof these rights, we consider whether, as a threshold matter, the\n\nindisputably unfinished \"Training Ground for Democracy\" was a \"work\n\nof visual art\" within the meaning of VARA.\n\n\n\n     8\n       Section 501(a) states, in relevant part, that \"[a]nyone who\nviolates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner . . .\nor of the author as provided in section 106A(a) [VARA] . . . is an\ninfringer of the copyright or right of the author, as the case may\nbe.\" The provision further states that, with the exception of the\ncriminal penalties provided under section 506, \"any reference to\ncopyright shall be deemed to include the rights conferred by\nsection 106A(a).\"\n\n                                      -21-\n\fC. Does VARA Apply to Unfinished Works of Art?\n\n            Büchel argues that the district court erred by failing to\n\nrecognize that VARA applies with equal force to incomplete artistic\n\nendeavors that would otherwise be subject to VARA protection.              He\n\nasserts that the Act's plain language compels such a conclusion,\n\nwhich he claims is confirmed by the legislative history and sparse\n\ncase law interpreting the statute.           The Museum, for its part, does\n\nnot argue that unfinished works are excluded from VARA's scope.\n\nInstead, it interprets the district court's opinion as \"expressly\n\nassum[ing]\" that VARA applied to \"Training Ground for Democracy\" in\n\nits incomplete state, and then concluding that Büchel had failed to\n\nput forth sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue regarding\n\nthe violation of his rights under the statute.\n\n            We do not read the district court's ruling to conclude\n\ncategorically   that   VARA    does    not    apply   to   unfinished   works.\n\nRather, the court held that, if the statute applied, \"display of\n\nth[e] unfinished installation would have violated neither Büchel's\n\nright of attribution nor his right of integrity.\"            565 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 259.     Nonetheless, the court repeatedly expressed skepticism\n\nabout Büchel's claim that the incomplete \"Training Ground\" fell\n\nwithin VARA's scope, observing at one point in its opinion that\n\n\"unfinished art may not be covered by VARA at all.\"               Id. at 258;\n\nsee also id. at 259 (\"[I]t is doubtful that VARA even covered the\n\nassembled     materials       that      constituted        this    unfinished\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\finstallation.\").      Moreover, the court qualified the statute's\n\napplication to unfinished works: \"To the extent that an artist\n\nseeks protection for an uncompleted work, a violation of one of\n\nVARA's two explicitly recognized rights must be demonstrated with\n\nspecial clarity.\"    Id. at 258.\n\n            Our review of the district court's interpretation of\n\nVARA is de novo.    Phillips, 459 F.3d at 139. \"'As in all statutory\n\nconstruction cases, we begin with the language of the statute,'\"\n\nid. (quoting Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, 450\n\n(2002)), and \"[i]f the meaning of the text is unambiguous our task\n\nends there as well,\" United States v. Godin, 534 F.3d 51, 56 (1st\n\nCir. 2008). \"If the statute's language is plain, the sole function\n\nof the courts - at least where the disposition required by the text\n\nis not absurd - is to enforce it according to its terms.\"                  In re\n\nRudler, 576 F.3d 37, 44 (1st Cir. 2009) (quotation marks and\n\ncitations omitted).\n\n           The   definition   of    a   \"work   of   visual   art\"   for    VARA\n\npurposes is stated \"in terms both positive (what it is) and\n\nnegative (what it is not).\"        Carter, 71 F.3d at 84.      An unfinished\n\nsculptural installation such as \"Training Ground for Democracy\" is\n\nnot one of the items specifically excluded from VARA protection,9\n\n\n     9\n       As provided in 17 U.S.C. § 106A(c)(3), VARA specifically\nexcludes certain categories of artwork listed in section 101 of the\nCopyright Act:\n\n     (A)   (i) any poster, map, globe, chart, technical\n\n                                     -23-\n\fand MASS MoCA wisely does not attempt to argue otherwise. Instead,\n\nwe must determine whether the \"positive\" aspect of the definition\n\nof \"work of visual art\" includes an unfinished version of a\n\n\"sculpture[] existing in a single copy.\"           17 U.S.C. § 101.\n\n            The text of VARA itself does not state when an artistic\n\nproject becomes a work of visual art subject to its protections.\n\nHowever,    VARA   is   part   of   the   Copyright   Act,   and   that   Act's\n\ndefinition section, which defines \"work of visual art,\" specifies\n\nthat its definitions, unless otherwise provided, control throughout\n\nTitle 17.    See 17 U.S.C. § 101.         That general definitional section\n\nof the Copyright Act states that a work is \"created\" when it \"is\n\nfixed in a copy . . . for the first time.\"            Further, \"where a work\n\nis prepared over a period of time, the portion of it that has been\n\nfixed at any particular time constitutes the work as of that time.\"\n\n17 U.S.C. § 101 (emphasis added).

The Scope of VARA's Integrity and Attribution Rights\n\n           1.    The Right of Integrity\n\n           VARA's    right    of   integrity,      codified   at   17     U.S.C.\n\n§ 106A(a)(3)(A), provides that an artist shall have the right \"to\n\nprevent    any    intentional      distortion,      mutilation,      or      other\n\nmodification of [his or her] work which would be prejudicial to his\n\nor her honor or reputation, and [that] any intentional distortion,\n\nmutilation, or modification of that work is a violation of that\n\nright.\"    It thus allows artists to protect their works against\n\nintentional modifications that would be prejudicial to their honor\n\nor   reputations.     House     Report   at   6,    as   reprinted      in    1990\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915.13\n\n           There is arguably some uncertainty about the plaintiff's\n\nburden of proof in a case such as this because the second part of\n\nsection (a)(3)(A) – stating that \"any intentional distortion,\n\nmutilation, or modification of th[e] work is a violation\" of the\n\nright of integrity – does not explicitly require a showing of\n\nprejudice when the alteration already has occurred and damages,\n\nrather than injunctive relief, would be the appropriate remedy.\n\nSee 5 Patry, supra, § 16:22 (noting the ambiguity).            Because those\n\nVARA cases that make it to court are \"generally . . . decided on\n\n\n      13\n       In some jurisdictions, the right of integrity also generally\nprotects artwork from destruction. See Carter, 71 F.3d at 81. In\nthe United States, however, VARA protects only works of \"recognized\nstature\" from destruction. 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(3)(B). That right\nis not implicated in this case.\n\n                                     -29-\n\fthreshold questions such as whether the artist's work is a work of\n\nvisual art within the scope of the Act,\" Pa & Robinson, supra, at\n\n26, courts have had little occasion to give content to the rights\n\nthat VARA guarantees.          See Wu, supra, at 159 (\"[C]ourts avoid\n\nconstruing the extent of VARA protection by finding that works do\n\nnot meet the threshold requirements for 'visual art' protected by\n\nVARA.\").     Unsurprisingly, therefore, we have found no case law\n\ndiscussing a possible difference in the showing required for\n\ninjunctive relief and damages for right-of-integrity claims.\n\n            Some courts, however, have assumed without analysis that\n\nthe prejudice showing is necessary for both injunctive relief and\n\ndamages.    See, e.g.,     Hanrahan v. Ramirez, No. 2:97-CV-7470, 1998\n\nWL 34369997, at *3 (C.D. Cal. June 3, 1998) (citing 17 U.S.C. §\n\n106A(a)(3)); Carter v. Helmsley-Spear,Inc., 861 F. Supp. 303, 329-\n\n30 (S.D.N.Y. 1994), aff'd in part, vacated in part, and rev'd in\n\npart by Carter, 71 F.3d at 77.            At least one commentator likewise\n\naccepts, without discussion, that the damages remedy requires a\n\nshowing of prejudice.          See Melville B. Nimmer, 3-8D Nimmer on\n\nCopyright     §    8D.06[C][1]      (noting     that    \"an   intentional        and\n\nprejudicial       mutilation   is   an    integrity     violation,      remediable\n\nthrough     not    only   an   injunction,        but    damages       as     well\").\n\nInterestingly,       Nimmer    raises,      and    dismisses,      a        different\n\nimprecision in section (a)(3)(A):\n\n            The   statutory   language   –   \"distortion,\n            mutilation, or other modification of the work\n\n                                         -30-\n\f           which would be prejudicial to his or her honor\n           or reputation\" – is susceptible of a reading\n           whereby the requisite prejudice applies only\n           to \"modification,\" not to the antecedents of\n           \"distortion\" or \"mutilation.\"      Though not\n           without ambiguity, the better view under the\n           Berne Convention, from which this language is\n           drawn, is that prejudice applies in all three\n           instances.\n\nId.\n\n           We agree with Nimmer's view of the provision, including\n\nthe   application   of   the   prejudice     requirement    to   a   claim   for\n\ndamages, and consider that construction soundly grounded in VARA's\n\nlegislative   history.         Under   the    heading      \"Purpose    of    the\n\nLegislation,\" the House Report notes that the right of integrity\n\n\"allows artists to protect their works against modifications and\n\ndestructions that are prejudicial to their honor or reputations.\"\n\nHouse Report at 6, as reprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915.                The\n\nReport also notes that the rights provided by VARA are \"analogous\n\nto those protected by Article 6bis of the Berne Convention,\" id.,\n\nwhich in turn describes the right of integrity as applicable to\n\n\"certain modifications and other derogatory actions\" that would be\n\nprejudicial to the artist's honor or reputation.14 Given the stated\n\n      14\n       Article 6bis of the Berne Convention, which is titled \"Moral\nRights,\" includes a heading that lists among those rights \"to\nobject to certain modifications and other derogatory actions.\" The\nprovision itself states, in relevant part:\n\n      (1) Independently of the author's economic rights, and\n      even after the transfer of the said rights, the author\n      shall have the right . . .to object to any distortion,\n      mutilation or other modification of, or other derogatory\n\n                                   -31-\n\fpurpose    of    the   legislation   and    the    similar      depiction     of    the\n\nintegrity right in the Berne Convention, we conclude that Congress\n\nintended     the   prejudice    requirement       to    apply   to   the    right   of\n\nintegrity       whether   the   remedy    sought       is   injunctive     relief    or\n\ndamages.15\n\n             Although VARA does not define the terms \"prejudicial,\"\n\n\"honor,\" or \"reputation,\" the House Report recommended that the\n\nprejudice inquiry \"focus on the artistic or professional honor or\n\nreputation of the individual as embodied in the work that is\n\nprotected,\" and \"examine the way in which a work has been modified\n\nand the professional reputation of the author of the work.\"                    House\n\n\n\n     action in relation to, the said work, which would be\n     prejudicial to his honor or reputation.\n\nBerne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works\nart. 6bis, Sept. 9, 1986, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99-27, 1161 U.N.T.S.\n30.\n     15\n       Based on revisions to the statutory language made during the\nlegislative process, Patry concludes that \"where an intentional\ndistortion, mutilation, or other modification has already occurred,\nthe plaintiff need not prove harm to his or her honor or\nreputation.\" 5 Patry, supra, § 16:22. He further states, without\nsupporting citation, that \"[i]t was understood informally\" that the\nfinal version of the provision was designed \"to permit a cause of\naction . . . without the need for proof that the artist's honor or\nreputation was harmed.\" Id. To the extent Patry's conclusion is\nthat no evidence of harm is necessary, we reject it as inconsistent\nwith the available legislative history, as discussed above. It may\nbe, however, that Congress's concern was only that a plaintiff not\nbe required to prove the actual amount of damage to reputation, but\ncould opt for the statutory damages remedy upon showing prejudice.\nSee 17 U.S.C. §§ 501(a), 504(c) (stating that a VARA plaintiff may\nelect to recover statutory damages instead of actual damages and\nprofits).\n\n                                         -32-\n\fReport   at    15,     as    reprinted    in    1990   U.S.C.C.A.N.     at   6925-26\n\n(footnotes         omitted).      Relying      on   dictionary   definitions     of\n\nprejudice, honor and reputation, the district court in Carter\n\nconcluded      that     it     should    \"consider     whether   [the    proposed]\n\nalteration would cause injury or damage to plaintiffs' good name,\n\npublic esteem, or reputation in the artistic community.\"                     861 F.\n\nSupp. at 323.        We think this a useful approach, but emphasize that\n\nthe focus is on the artist's reputation in relation to the altered\n\nwork of art; the artist need not have public stature beyond the\n\ncontext of the creation at issue.                   See House Report at 15, as\n\nreprinted in 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6925 (\"[A]n author need not prove\n\na pre-existing standing in the artistic community.\").\n\n              2.    The Right of Attribution\n\n              VARA's right of attribution grants the author of a work\n\nof visual art the right, in part, (1) \"to claim authorship of that\n\nwork\"; (2)     \"to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of\n\nany work of visual art which he or she did not create\"; and (3) \"to\n\nprevent the use of his or her name as the author of the work of\n\nvisual art in the event of a distortion, mutilation, or other\n\nmodification of the work which would be prejudicial to his or her\n\nhonor or reputation.\"             17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(1),(2).            The right\n\n\"ensures that artists are correctly identified with the works of\n\nart they create, and that they are not identified with works\n\ncreated by others.\"             House Report at 6, as reprinted in 1990\n\n\n                                         -33-\n\fU.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915.         In addition, if a work of visual art has\n\nbeen distorted or modified (and, unlike the integrity right, the\n\noriginal distortion or modification need not be intentional),\n\nassociating the author's name with the distorted work against his\n\nwishes would violate his right of attribution.\n\n           The right of attribution under VARA thus gives an artist\n\na claim for injunctive relief to, inter alia, assert or disclaim\n\nauthorship of a work.         Whether VARA entitles an artist to damages\n\nfor violation of the right of attribution is a separate question.\n\nWe find the answer in the difference between the statutory language\n\non the right of integrity and the language on the right of\n\nattribution. Subsection (a)(3) of section 106A, which codifies the\n\nright of integrity, is further divided into two subsections: (A)\n\nconfers   the   right    to    protect   the   work   against   intentional\n\nalterations that would be prejudicial to honor or reputation, and\n\n(B) confers the right to protect a work of \"recognized stature\"\n\nfrom destruction.16     Although both subsections are framed as rights\n\n\"to prevent\" certain conduct, they both also contain an additional\n\nclause stating that the occurrence of that conduct is, at least in\n\ncertain circumstances, \"a violation of th[e] right\" to prevent the\n\n\n\n     16\n        Section 106A(a)(3) states that the author of a work of\nvisual art shall have the right \"(A) to prevent any intentional\ndistortion, mutilation, or other modification of that work which\nwould be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation\" and the\nright \"(B) to prevent any destruction of a work of recognized\nstature.\"\n\n                                     -34-\n\fconduct from happening.             See 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(3)(A) (\"any\n\nintentional distortion, mutilation, or modification of that work is\n\na   violation     of   that    right\");   id.     at    §    106(a)(3)(B)   (\"any\n\nintentional or grossly negligent destruction of that work is a\n\nviolation of that right\").\n\n            No such \"violation\" clause is included in the sections\n\ncodifying   the    right      of   attribution.        See   Nimmer,   supra,   at\n\n§ 8D.06[B][1] (\"The statute does not make any provision to redress\n\nviolation of any of the foregoing three attribution rights.\"). The\n\nlegislative history sheds no light on this difference, but Nimmer\n\nspeculates as follows:\n\n            Perhaps the implication is that whereas an\n            integrity violation could give rise to a\n            monetary recovery, failure to attribute is\n            remediable solely through injunction. If that\n            conclusion were intended, Congress certainly\n            could   have   expressed   its   intent  less\n            obliquely.\n\nId.   We agree with Nimmer's surmise that VARA does not provide a\n\ndamages remedy for an attribution violation.                 Where the statutory\n\nlanguage is framed as a right \"to prevent\" conduct, it does not\n\nnecessarily follow that a plaintiff is entitled to damages once the\n\nconduct occurs. The question is whether \"doing\" the act the artist\n\nhas a right to prevent also triggers a damages remedy, and the\n\nstatutory language indicates that Congress answered that question\n\nfor the attribution right differently from the integrity right.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -35-\n\f             It is also noteworthy that Congress crafted a damages\n\nremedy for the destruction of a work of recognized stature that is\n\nnarrower than the right to prevent destruction of such works.\n\nWhile   an   artist       may    \"prevent      any      destruction     of    a    work   of\n\nrecognized stature,\" only an \"intentional or grossly negligent\n\ndestruction of that work is a violation of that right.\"                           17 U.S.C.\n\n§ 106A(a)(3)(B) (emphasis added). This narrowing further indicates\n\nthat    Congress     did        not   intend       a     damages    remedy        to    arise\n\nautomatically from the right to prevent conduct.                           In failing to\n\nprovide a damages remedy for any type of violation of the moral\n\nright of attribution, Congress may have concluded that artists\n\ncould obtain adequate relief for the harms of false attribution by\n\nresorting to the Copyright Act and other traditional claims.\n\nB. Büchel's VARA Claims\n\n             With this legal framework in mind, we turn to the record\n\nbefore the district court.             By dismantling \"Training Ground,\" the\n\nMuseum prevented the further use of Büchel's name in connection\n\nwith the work, eliminating any basis for injunctive relief, and we\n\ntherefore    do     not   address      the    attribution          claim   in     our    VARA\n\nanalysis.      We    thus       consider     the       evidence    in   the   light      most\n\nfavorable to Büchel in determining whether there are genuine issues\n\nof material fact regarding the alleged violations of his right of\n\nintegrity.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -36-\n\f           As    noted   above,   the   district   court   concluded   that\n\nBüchel's right of integrity was not implicated by MASS MoCA's\n\nconduct.   The court found that \"nothing in MASS MoCA's planned\n\ndisplay of the unfinished installation would have violated Büchel's\n\nright of integrity, for the simple reason that no completed work of\n\nart ever existed on these facts for the museum to distort, mutilate\n\nor modify.\"     56 F. Supp. 2d at 260.    Although the court stated that\n\nit would assume that VARA applied to unfinished works, its analysis\n\nappears to be influenced by a more limited view of the statute's\n\nscope.   The court stated that \"[t]o suggest that the display of an\n\nunfinished and abandoned work somehow constitutes a distortion,\n\nmutilation, or modification of that non-existent work is simply\n\ninconsistent with the ordinary usage of those terms.\"          Id.   Having\n\nconcluded that VARA applies with full force to unfinished works,\n\nhowever, we cannot accept the district court's reliance on the\n\nunfinished state of \"Training Ground\" to minimize the rights of its\n\ncreator.\n\n           It cannot be disputed that, at least by the time Büchel\n\nleft North Adams in December 2006, \"Training Ground\" was \"fixed\"\n\nwithin the meaning of the Copyright Act – i.e., materials had been\n\nplaced in Building 5 \"by or under the authority of the author\" in\n\na \"sufficiently permanent or stable\" manner to allow the work to be\n\n\"communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.\"           17\n\nU.S.C. § 101.     The elements of the installation had been chosen by\n\n\n                                   -37-\n\fBüchel, and his assistants and the Museum workers had put numerous\n\ncomponents of the project in place under his direct supervision.\n\nAlthough far from complete, the work by the end of 2006 included\n\nparts of the \"Saddam Compound\" and the cinema, and Büchel and his\n\nassistants had begun detailing several of the containers intended\n\nto house elements such as a jail, museum and voting booths.           With\n\nthis substantial work in place, the sculpture had an established\n\npresence in Building 5.      Büchel thus had rights in the work that\n\nwere protected under VARA, notwithstanding its unfinished state.\n\n          Büchel alleges that MASS MoCA violated his right to\n\nintegrity in three distinct ways: first, by continuing to work on\n\nthe installation without his authorization, particularly in early\n\n2007, and by then exhibiting the distorted artwork to the public;\n\nsecond, by using tarpaulins to \"partially cover[]\" – and thus\n\nmodify and distort – the installation, and allowing Museum visitors\n\nto see it in that condition; and third, merely by showing Büchel's\n\nwork in its unfinished state, which he claims was a distortion.\n\nBüchel asserts that these actions caused prejudice to his honor or\n\nreputation.\n\n          As we shall explain, we conclude that summary judgment\n\nwas improperly granted to MASS MoCA because material disputes of\n\nfact exist concerning the first of Büchel's integrity claims –\n\ni.e.,   that   MASS   MoCA   modified    \"Training   Ground\"   over   his\n\nobjections, to his detriment.     We further conclude that the record\n\n\n                                  -38-\n\fcontains sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find that MASS\n\nMoCA's actions caused prejudice to Büchel's honor or reputation.\n\nThe other integrity claims, however, are unavailing.\n\n           1.   Continuing Work on \"Training Ground\"\n\n           Büchel   asserts   that,   in   the   months    following   his\n\ndeparture from North Adams in December 2006, the Museum encroached\n\non his artistic vision by making modifications to the installation\n\nthat in some instances were directly contrary to his instructions.\n\nIn rejecting Büchel's VARA claims, the district court described the\n\nMuseum's actions as perhaps \"occasionally misguided\" attempts \"to\n\nimplement Büchel's long-distance instructions.\" 565 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n260.    The court found that these \"[f]umbled efforts to assist in\n\ncreating, or failing to create, a work of art are not equivalent to\n\ndistortion, modification, or mutilation of the art.\"          Id. at 260-\n\n61.\n\n           Although a jury might agree with the court's assessment,\n\nthe evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Büchel would\n\nallow a finding that at least some of the Museum's actions violated\n\nVARA.   The record permits the inference that, even during his time\n\nas an artist-in-residence at MASS MoCA, Museum staff members were\n\ndisregarding his instructions and intentionally modifying \"Training\n\nGround\" in a manner that he did not approve.              For example, on\n\nDecember 14, 2006, just before he left for the holidays, Büchel\n\ncomplained to Thompson that in \"many cases people just do stuff\n\n\n                                 -39-\n\fwithout checking back if its ok to do s[omething], when they think\n\nby themselves the plan has to be changed.\"         Büchel expressed\n\nfurther concerns in an email to Thompson later that month: \"I don't\n\n[k]now if this is really a great opportunity when you get an\n\ninvitation to do a show, where you have to make constantly tons of\n\ncompromises,   where   you   have   to   fight   constantly   against\n\nstubborn[n]ess as well [as] against the institution and work with\n\npeople that think they know my art better than i do as well [as]\n\ntry to sabotage the project . . . .\"\n\n           In early 2007, when he was no longer on-site, Büchel\n\nagain accused the Museum of \"sabotage acts\" and, in a January 16\n\nletter, issued an ultimatum: he would return to North Adams to\n\ncomplete \"Training Ground\" only if the Museum assented to a number\n\nof specific conditions.      Aside from certain budgetary concerns\n\nirrelevant here, Büchel included the following among his list of\n\ndemands:\n\n                  There is NO negotiation about the scope\n           of the project.\n                  There are no elements to be eliminated\n           as you propose and I don't accept any orders\n           and any more pressure or compromises how\n           things have to be done, neither from you or\n           your crew . . . .\n                  I will not give you any permission to\n           show an unfinished project nor will I show nor\n           let you show any work in progress, as you\n           proposed already earlier.\n                  I will not accept without consequences\n           any additional sabotage acts, as done to\n           artworks of mine and as well done to the\n           installation in progress[.]\n\n\n                                -40-\n\fThe letter also identified several points of disagreement with the\n\nMuseum concerning the content of the project, including Büchel's\n\ninsistence      that    there   be   \"no    transport     street   through    the\n\nexhibition\" and that he did not \"need to be told if an airplane\n\nfuselage section fits in the show or not.                   I don't negotiate\n\nconstantly my art with you or Nato . . . .\"               Accusing the Museum\n\ndirector of showing \"little respect towards [his] plans,\" he told\n\nThompson \"please don't tell me all the time how I have to do my\n\nproject regarding its scope and it's [sic] methods that needs [sic]\n\nto be applied.\"\n\n               Unsatisfied with the Museum's response to his list of\n\ndemands, Büchel wrote to Thompson again on January 27, 2007.                    He\n\nwarned that, based on the information he had been provided, \"there\n\n[was] a lot of stuff not being done according to my instructions.\"\n\nAgain,    he    noted   several   elements     of   the   work   that   had   been\n\ninstalled against his wishes.17            Thompson and Büchel traded emails\n\nduring the first few days of February, with Büchel stating that he\n\nwould \"not negotiate further this matter . . . because almost any\n\nof the main conditions are simply not fulfilled\" and Thompson\n\nwriting that he believed the Museum had \"responded to [Büchel's]\n\nmain issues.\"\n\n\n\n     17\n        \"I wrote very clearly immediately to [Dante Birch, the\nMuseum's production manager] not to use the method we talked about\nand stop it . . . , as well cinder block walls have to be partly\nredone that have been built without my instruction . . . .\"\n\n                                      -41-\n\f             After that, direct communication between Büchel and the\n\nMuseum became sparse.            It was during this time, Büchel alleges,\n\nthat the Museum developed a \"Plan B\"18 to be implemented in the\n\nevent – which was looking increasingly likely – that he did not\n\nreturn to finish the exhibit.                 Plan B, which involved publicly\n\nexhibiting        the    unfinished    installation     without       the   artist's\n\npermission,        called     for    completing     various     elements    of   the\n\ninstallation in a way the Museum knew might differ from Büchel's\n\nartistic concept.          Büchel cites an email chain on February 14 that\n\nincluded Joseph Thompson and Dante Birch, in which Thompson,\n\nstating that the Museum \"seem[ed] to be getting closer and closer\n\nto Plan B,\" gave specific instructions on various elements of the\n\ninstallation.          Thompson suggested that Museum staff do \"[a]nything\n\nelse Dante and Nato feel is known with 80% certainty.\"\n\n             At    least      some   Museum   staff   members    recognized      that\n\ncontinuing to work on the installation without Büchel's input might\n\nbe problematic.          Later in the February 14 email chain, Dante Birch\n\nnoted     that    he    was   “interested     in   protecting   the    museum    from\n\nintellectual property issues.”                Pointing out that the show was\n\nadvertised as a Büchel in the Museum's schedule, he stated that\n\nwhen reviewers came, \"the question will be 'what is it?' . . . and\n\nif it's reviewed as a Buchel we’re in deep shit.”                Thompson’s plans\n\n\n\n     18\n         The term \"Plan B\" appears in the record in a February 14,\n2007 email from Thompson to other Museum staff.\n\n                                         -42-\n\falso raised concern among other MASS MoCA employees, including\n\ncurator Susan Cross, who cautioned Thompson in a January 31 email\n\nthat \"we tend to forget that whether we're doing the welding or\n\nnot, there is an 'author' – an artist for whom we shouldn't make\n\ndecisions. . . .     At what point, if at all, does an artist lose his\n\nright to owning the idea and his/her 'intellectual property?' . . .\n\nI think it is still art and still belongs to Buchel.\"\n\n            Both in his deposition and in his affidavit, Büchel\n\ndescribed   ways     in   which   he    felt     the   Museum    had   knowingly\n\ndisregarded his specific instructions.             For example, MASS MoCA's\n\ndecision to build a cinderblock wall through the Cape Cod-style\n\nhouse in the installation, despite Büchel’s expressed desire that\n\nthe   construction    await   his      return,    resulted      in   what   Büchel\n\nconsidered a \"big distortion of the meaning of that element.\"\n\nThe record is replete with similar allegations concerning other\n\ncomponents of the installation, including the cinema, the bomb\n\ncarousel, the Saddam spiderhole, the police car and the mobile\n\nhome.   Indeed, even the Museum, in its August 31, 2007 memorandum\n\nof law in support of its motion for summary judgment, admitted that\n\nthe installation \"[m]aterials as they now stand reflect significant\n\naesthetic and design choices by MASS MoCA personnel, including with\n\nrespect to the layout of the [m]aterials, and with respect to the\n\nselection and procurement of pre-existing buildings and vehicles\n\n\n\n\n                                       -43-\n\fthat have been modified and incorporated into the [m]aterials.\"\n\n(Emphasis added.)19\n\n            MASS    MoCA   argues   that     the   evidence,   taken   in   its\n\nentirety, does not add up to a triable issue with respect to a\n\nviolation of Büchel’s right of integrity, but shows only that\n\nMuseum personnel were attempting to carry out Büchel's vision based\n\non his instructions. Indeed, the Museum notes that the work slowed\n\nas   Büchel’s      instructions     became    unavailable.20      MASS      MoCA\n\nspecifically disputes Büchel's reading of the February 14 email\n\nchain as demonstrating the Museum's disregard of his creative\n\n\n\n     19\n        This assertion by MASS MoCA was made to support its\ncontention, rejected by the district court and halfheartedly\nrenewed on appeal, that the unfinished installation might\nconstitute a joint work of Büchel and the Museum. A claim of joint\nauthorship requires proof that the parties \"entertain in their\nminds the concept of joint ownership.\" Thomson v. Larson, 147 F.3d\n195, 201 (2d Cir. 1998) (quotation marks and citation omitted).\nHere, multiple facts indicate that the parties' understanding from\nthe outset was that \"Training Ground\" was solely a Christoph Büchel\nwork of art.       The Museum's December 6, 2006 postponement\nannouncement described the work as \"Christoph Büchel's vast\ninstallation\" and, as reflected in the emails described above,\nMuseum personnel internally recognized Büchel as the artist, at\nleast as \"Training Ground\" was originally conceived. It is also\nundisputed that, at the outset of their relationship, the parties\nhad agreed that Büchel alone would hold the copyright in the\nfinished work. These facts negate any claim of joint authorship.\n     20\n          In his deposition, Thompson testified as follows:\n\n     [T]here was a whole long list of things for which we had\n     adequate direction and understanding that we could\n     continue forward to a certain point. When the work began\n     to get very detailed and would require input from\n     Christoph, if we could get the input from him, we would\n     continue, and if we didn't, we would stop.\n\n                                     -44-\n\frights over the installation, asserting that the discussion among\n\nits staff members in fact reflects a conscious effort to determine\n\nhow far the Museum could appropriately go in light of the remaining\n\ninstructions left by the artist.                  In one email, for example,\n\nThompson noted that \"we are putting the correct objects in the\n\nspaces cb indicated . . . .             That's not 'doing a buechel [sic]'\n\nthat's prepping for buechel [sic] assuming, as we still are, that\n\nthere     is     some    chance    we'll    see   him    here    again.\"        Other\n\ncommunications in the record also could be interpreted as showing\n\nthe Museum doing its best to carry out Büchel’s concept for the art\n\nwork.\n\n               As we have noted, a jury may well accept the Museum's\n\ndepiction of its intention and its actions.                     At this juncture,\n\nhowever, the record must be viewed in the light most favorable to\n\nBüchel. The evidence we have described would permit a jury to find\n\nthat the Museum forged ahead with the installation in the first\n\nhalf of 2007 knowing that the continuing construction in Büchel's\n\nabsence would frustrate – and likely contradict – Büchel's artistic\n\nvision.        We thus conclude that a jury issue exists as to whether\n\nthese     actions       effected   an      intentional   distortion        or   other\n\nmodification of \"Training Ground\" that subjected MASS MoCA to\n\nliability under VARA.\n\n               The record also contains evidence from which a jury could\n\nconclude that the Museum's alterations had a detrimental impact on\n\n\n                                           -45-\n\fBüchel's honor or reputation.             An article in the Boston Globe\n\nreported    that,   in    February,     Museum    officials   had     shown   the\n\nunfinished project to a group of Museum directors and curators who\n\nwere attending an arts conference in the area.              See Geoff Edgers,\n\nBehind doors, a world unseen: Dispute cloaks massive installation\n\nat   MASS   MoCA,   Boston      Globe   (March    28,    2007),   available   at\n\nwww.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2007/03/28/behind_doors_a\n\n_world_unseen/      (\"Behind     doors,    a     world   unseen\").      Another\n\njournalist    reported     on    observing     the   unfinished      (and   still\n\nuntarped) work.     See The Show Will Go On, supra.\n\n            Although the commentary generated by these visits is not\n\nall negative,21 there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find\n\nthat the changes to \"Training Ground\" caused prejudice to Büchel.\n\nThe New York Times noted that the exhibition would \"certainly give\n\npeople unfamiliar with his obsessive, history-driven aesthetic an\n\ninaccurate sense of his art, and this is indeed a form of damage.\"\n\nIs It Art Yet?, supra.          A critic for the Boston Globe similarly\n\nobserved that \"many people are going to judge [Büchel] and his work\n\non the basis of this experience.\" Ken Johnson, No admittance: MASS\n\nMoCA has mishandled disputed art installation, Boston Globe, July\n\n1, 2007, at 1N.          One viewer, writing in Commentary magazine,\n\n\n      21\n       Thompson told an outside consultant for the Museum in March\n2007 that a curator at the New Museum in New York had just viewed\nthe installation \"and said it was one of the best works he's seen\nin the past three years.\"\n\n                                        -46-\n\fobserved that “I am not sure that it suffers from being enveiled.”\n\nMichael      J.       Lewis,       The      Cost     of     Transgression,\n\nhttp://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/lewis/499 (June\n\n4, 2007).    A review published in Berkshire Fine Arts – subtitled\n\n\"Crap Under Wrap\" – concluded that it would be a \"huge mistake\" to\n\nuncover the installation, which offered \"virtually nothing of\n\nsubstance or interest.\"        Crap Under    Wrap, supra.\n\n            The    record   thus   shows     that   some   viewers   of   the\n\ninstallation reacted unfavorably to the work in its allegedly\n\nmodified and distorted form.             A factfinder might conclude, of\n\ncourse, that it was Büchel's underlying concept (notwithstanding\n\nits unfinished state) rather than MASS MoCA's actions that elicited\n\nthe negative reactions.         However, a jury could also reasonably\n\ninfer that the negative impressions resulted from the Museum's\n\nunauthorized modifications to \"Training Ground,\" diminishing the\n\nquality of the work and thereby harming Büchel's professional honor\n\nor reputation as a visual artist.\n\n                  In concluding that Büchel has adduced sufficient\n\nevidence to support a right-of-integrity claim, we reject the\n\nMuseum’s assertion that to find a violation of Büchel's right of\n\nintegrity in these circumstances would make it impossible for\n\nparties to collaborate on large-scale artistic works.            The Museum\n\nwarns that, under Büchel’s interpretation, \"no one other than the\n\nartist himself . . . may ever perform any work in fabricating\n\n\n                                     -47-\n\fvisual art unless that specific task has been authorized by the\n\nartist.\"    We disagree.   Although the artist's vision must govern,\n\nthat principle does not prevent collaboration at the implementation\n\nlevel so long as the artist's vision guides that implementation.\n\nHere, Büchel alleges a campaign of intentional distortion and\n\nmodification to his work in which Museum personnel repeatedly\n\nignored his express wishes.    Our holding that the summary judgment\n\nrecord precludes an affirmance of the district court on this claim\n\nmay serve as a cautionary tale to museums contemplating similar\n\ninstallations in the future – guiding them to document the terms of\n\ntheir relationship and obtain VARA waivers where necessary – but it\n\ndoes not prevent museums or other collaborators from working\n\ncooperatively with artists on such non-traditional artworks.\n\n            2.   Showing \"Training Ground\" Covered with Tarpaulins\n\n            Büchel also claims that MASS MoCA improperly modified and\n\ndistorted “Training Ground” when it partially covered it with the\n\nyellow tarpaulins and displayed it in that condition.     He asserts\n\nthat the record shows beyond dispute that visitors looked behind\n\nthe tarps, that the tarp-adorned installation was \"judged by others\n\nto be Büchel's work, and that his honor and reputation were harmed\n\nby it.\"    In response, the Museum argues that the yellow tarpaulins\n\nwere merely functional – a way of keeping people \"out\" of the\n\ninstallation – rather than an aesthetic modification of the artwork\n\nthat gave MASS MoCA patrons a distorted view of it.\n\n\n                                 -48-\n\f            Although the tarpaulins did prevent visitors to the\n\nMuseum from seeing the entire unfinished installation, the record\n\nshows that a number of people were able to form an impression of\n\n\"Training Ground\" despite the partial covering.                  For example,\n\naccording to one observer,\n\n            [the tarps] don't reach the floor, and they\n            rise only about two feet above eye level, so\n            they don't cover much. You can easily crouch\n            down to slip your head underneath or peek\n            through the slits between the vinyl sheets.\n            Beyond the passageway formed by the tarps, the\n            monumental elements of the installation rise\n            all around you, plain as day — the cinderblock\n            walls, the two-story house, the guard tower,\n            the trailers, the carnival ride, all compacted\n            together in a claustrophobic, politically\n            surreal borough of hell, George Orwell by way\n            of David Lynch.\n\nThomas Micchelli, Christoph Büchel Training Ground for Democracy,\n\nThe      Brooklyn       Rail     (September        2007),      available       at\n\nhttp://www.brooklynrail.org/2007/09/artseen/buchel. Another critic\n\nnoted that the installation “under all the tarps is really kind of\n\na conceptual peep show. It doesn’t take much effort or imagination\n\nto see most of the work . . . .            Mass MoCA is hiding an elephant\n\nbehind a napkin,” and called it a “wink, wink, wrap show.”                    Crap\n\nUnder Wrap, supra.        Photographs in the record confirm that the\n\ncovers   did    not   obscure    the    general   path   and   layout   of    the\n\ninstallation.       Indeed, given the location of \"Training Ground,\"\n\nvisitors   to   \"Made    at    MASS    MoCA\"   could   not   avoid   seeing   the\n\nunfinished \"Training Ground\" bedecked in tarpaulins.\n\n\n                                        -49-\n\f             Nonetheless, although the installation unquestionably\n\nlooked different with the tarpaulins partially covering it, we\n\nagree with the district court that the mere covering of the artwork\n\nby the Museum, its host, cannot reasonably be deemed an intentional\n\nact   of    distortion    or   modification   of   Büchel's   creation.    To\n\nconclude otherwise would be to say that, even if all had gone well,\n\nthe Museum would have been subject to a right-of-integrity claim if\n\nit had partially covered the work before its formal opening to\n\nprevent visitors from seeing it prematurely.\n\n             This is not to say that MASS MoCA was necessarily acting\n\nwith pure intentions when it created \"Made at MASS MoCA\" in close\n\nproximity to the tarped \"Training Ground.\"             It might be a fair\n\ninference that the Museum was deliberately communicating its anger\n\nwith Büchel by juxtaposing his unfinished work with the successful\n\nartistic collaborations depicted in its new exhibition.                   The\n\npartial covering of \"Training Ground\" may have been intended to\n\nhighlight, rather than hide, the failed collaboration.22           The right\n\nof    integrity   under    VARA,   however,    protects   the   artist    from\n\ndistortions of his work, not from disparaging commentary about his\n\n\n\n       22\n        Indeed, the Boston Globe's art critic, Ken Johnson,\ndescribed the exhibit as a \"self-serving photo and text display\"\nthat implicitly conveys criticism of Büchel for the failure of\n\"Training Ground for Democracy.\"    See MASS MoCA has Mishandled\nDisputed Art Installation, supra. The juxtaposition left Johnson\nwith the impression that MASS MoCA was \"exacting revenge\" against\nthe artist \"by turning his project into a show that misrepresents,\ndishonors, vilifies, and even ridicules him.\" Id.\n\n                                     -50-\n\fbehavior.    In our view, a finding that the Museum's covering of the\n\ninstallation     constituted   an    intentional      act   of   distortion   or\n\nmodification of Büchel's artistic creation would stretch VARA\n\nbeyond sensible boundaries.\n\n            3.   Exhibiting \"Training Ground\" in Its Unfinished State\n\n            Büchel   maintains      that,    even   aside   from   the    alleged\n\nmodifications to “Training Ground,” merely exhibiting the work of\n\nart   in   its   unfinished    state,   without      the    artist’s     consent,\n\nconstitutes a distortion.       We reject this claim.         A separate moral\n\nright of disclosure (also known as the right of divulgation)\n\nprotects an author's authority to \"prevent third parties from\n\ndisclosing [his or her] work to the public without the author's\n\nconsent,\" and is not covered by VARA.               See Cyrill P. Rigamonti,\n\nDeconstructing Moral Rights, 47 Harv. Int'l L.J. 353, 373, 405\n\n(2006) \"([T]he VARA ignores the rights of disclosure and withdrawal\n\nand instead focuses on the rights of attribution and integrity\n\n. . . .\").\n\n            Although Büchel proffered an expert who opined that\n\nshowing an unfinished work without the artist’s permission is\n\ninherently a distortion, we decline to interpret VARA to include\n\nsuch a claim where a separate moral right of disclosure is widely\n\nrecognized in other jurisdictions and Congress explicitly limited\n\nthe statute's coverage to the rights of attribution and integrity.\n\nSee Amy M. Adler, Against Moral Rights, 97 Cal. L. Rev. 263,                  268\n\n\n                                      -51-\n\f(2009) (noting that most European countries \"recognize a right of\n\ndivulgation, giving the artist the right to decide when (and\n\nwhether) the work is complete and can be shown\"); Rigamonti, supra,\n\nat 356 (\"The standard set of moral rights recognized in the\n\nliterature consists of the author's right to claim authorship\n\n(right of attribution), the right to object to modifications of the\n\nwork (right of integrity), the right to decide when and how the\n\nwork in question will be published (right of disclosure), and the\n\nright to withdraw a work after publication (right of withdrawal).\"\n\n(footnotes omitted)); 5 Patry on Copyright § 16:23 (noting that\n\nVARA does not give the artist \"a right to prohibit display of\n\nmutilated versions of his or her work, only the right to prohibit\n\nthe mutilation itself\").    Any right Büchel possesses to withhold\n\ndisplay of his artwork must be found outside VARA.      We consider\n\nbelow his claim to such a right under section 106(5) of the\n\nCopyright Act.    See infra Section IV.\n\n           4.   Summary of VARA Claims\n\n           After careful review of the record, we are persuaded that\n\na reasonable jury could find that Büchel is entitled to relief\n\nunder VARA based on the Museum's continuing work on \"Training\n\nGround\" over his objections.     Genuine disputes of material fact\n\nforeclose summary judgment for either Büchel or MASS MoCA on that\n\nclaim.   We find no merit, however, in Büchel's claim that MASS MoCA\n\nintentionally modified or distorted \"Training Ground\" by covering\n\n\n                                -52-\n\fit with tarpaulins, and we reject as outside the scope of the\n\nstatute Büchel's claim that the Museum violated VARA by displaying\n\nthe installation over his objections.             We affirm the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment for the Museum on Büchel's right-\n\nof-attribution claim, which became moot when MASS MoCA dismantled\n\nthe installation in 2007.\n\n                                       IV.\n\n            We now assess Büchel's challenge to the grant of summary\n\njudgment for MASS MoCA on his Copyright Act claims.\n\nA. Public Display\n\n            The owner of a copyrighted work has the exclusive right\n\nto \"display the copyrighted work publicly.\"              17 U.S.C. § 106(5).\n\nDisplaying a work is defined as \"show[ing] a copy of it, either\n\ndirectly or by means of a film, slide, television image, or any\n\nother device or process.\"          17 U.S.C. § 101.    A \"copy\" includes the\n\noriginal.    Id.    Büchel argued below, as he does on appeal, that the\n\nMuseum's    repeated     public    exhibitions   of    \"Training   Ground   for\n\nDemocracy\" constituted a public display of his work in violation of\n\nhis exclusive right under section 106(5).             The district court gave\n\nno explicit reason for its dismissal of this claim, remarking only\n\nthat   \"[f]or      the   reasons   already   stated,\"     presumably   in   its\n\ndiscussion of VARA, MASS MoCA was \"entitled to judgment on this\n\ncount.\"    565 F. Supp. 2d at 261.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -53-\n\f               The court also remarked, however, that since Büchel\n\n\"would have suffered a violation of no right recognized by this\n\nstatute, this messy situation simply fell outside the boundary of\n\nVARA and, a fortiori, outside the more general provisions of the\n\nCopyright Act.\"       Id. at 260.    This statement reflects a misreading\n\nof the Copyright Act.         As we have explained, the moral rights\n\ngranted to specific artists under VARA are separate and independent\n\nfrom the economic rights guaranteed by section 106.              17 U.S.C. §\n\n106A(a) (providing that rights of attribution and integrity are\n\n\"independent of the exclusive rights provided in section 106\").\n\nThus, the inadequacy of claims under VARA does not, on its own,\n\nsignify the inadequacy of more traditional copyright claims.              See\n\nWu, supra, at 164 (observing that VARA has \"acquired the attributes\n\nof a false talisman,\" both because artists overly rely on it in\n\n\"instances where economic rights, including traditional rights of\n\ncopyright provided by Section 106 . . . would more effectively\n\nprotect their interests\" and also because courts tend to view VARA\n\nclaims as \"devalu[ing] entitlements to economic rights pleaded in\n\ntandem with VARA claims\").\n\n           We thus turn specifically to this claim.               The Museum\n\nargues that Büchel has failed to present a triable issue of fact on\n\nhis claim under section 106(5) because the unfinished work was\n\nnever publicly displayed.           However, as we have described in the\n\ncontext   of    our   VARA   discussion,     there   is   significant   record\n\n\n                                      -54-\n\fevidence suggesting that the work was repeatedly and deliberately\n\nexhibited to numerous individuals.23\n\n            MASS MoCA also asserts an affirmative defense under\n\nsection 109(c), which provides that \"the owner of a particular copy\n\nlawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such\n\nowner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner,\n\nto display that copy publicly.\"           17 U.S.C. § 109(c).        The Museum\n\nargues that it owned the physical copy of \"Training Ground,\" and\n\nthat    section   109(c)      therefore   permitted   it   to   display        the\n\nunfinished work.     Here again, however, the record reveals disputed\n\nissues of fact with respect to whether the Museum's copy was\n\n\"lawfully made,\" as it may have been created in violation of the\n\nartist's rights under VARA.          Moreover, Büchel introduced evidence\n\nto rebut the Museum's assertion that \"the installation's various\n\ncomponents\" all belonged to, or were purchased by, MASS MoCA.\n\nFinally, Büchel presented evidence that the Museum understood that\n\nthe    physical   copy   of    the   installation   belonged    to    him.24\n\n\n       23\n       In addition to the journalists and Museum personnel noted\nearlier, a newspaper reported that the mayor of North Adams had\nseen the exhibit twice, once with Governor Deval Patrick.    See\nBehind doors, a world unseen, supra.\n       24\n        For example, in an email sent on September 11, 2006 to\ncurator Nato Thompson, the Museum's director (Joseph Thompson)\nsaid: \"I assume you've already laid out the general idea [to\nBüchel] (we build it, and it belongs to you),\" and also noted that\nBüchel had the right to \"sell all or part of it.\" The Museum's\nproposed contract, which was never signed, would have conferred\nownership on Büchel. It stated that, \"[u]pon termination of the\nexhibition, the fabricated work shall be owned outright by you,\n\n                                      -55-\n\fAccordingly, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to\n\nBüchel, we cannot say that a reasonable jury could not conclude\n\nthat the Museum violated his exclusive right to publicly display\n\n\"Training Ground for Democracy.\"\n\nB. Derivative Works\n\n          The Copyright Act also grants artists the exclusive right\n\nto \"prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.\"                  17\n\nU.S.C. § 106(2).     A derivative work is defined as one \"based upon\n\none or more preexisting works,\" such as a translation, musical\n\narrangement, fictionalization, \"or any other form in which a work\n\nmay be recast, transformed, or adapted.\" 17 U.S.C. § 101.                        A\n\nderivative   work    includes     any   work   \"consisting     of    editorial\n\nrevisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which,\n\nas a whole, represent an original work of authorship.\"              Id.    Büchel\n\nbrought two claims based on this provision, asserting that MASS\n\nMoCA   created     unauthorized     derivative    works      based        on   the\n\ninstallation itself and on the work's models and plans.\n\n          The district court ruled that, \"[e]ven assuming that the\n\nstumbling,   and    eventually    abandoned,   process    of   collaboration\n\nduring 2006 produced an original work of art subject to copyright\n\nprotection, which is highly doubtful, clearly no 'derivative' work\n\nof art was created by MASS MoCA's attempt (however flawed) to play\n\nits part in this process.\"        565 F. Supp. 2d at 261.           It further\n\n\nincluding all copyrights and related preparatory materials.\"\n\n                                    -56-\n\frejected Büchel's argument that, by placing tarpaulins over the\n\nunfinished    installation,          the     Museum     created        a    separate,\n\nunauthorized derivative work.          Id.\n\n            On appeal, Büchel summarily argues that what the Museum\n\ndisplayed    in    Building     5,   both    with     and    without       the   yellow\n\ntarpaulins,       \"recast\"   or    \"transformed\"       the    work     that      he   had\n\noriginally set out in his plans and left behind in December 2006,\n\nthus creating derivative works under the Copyright Act.25                              In\n\nresponse, MASS MoCA again argues that its staff was following\n\nBüchel's instructions when working on \"Training Ground\" in his\n\nabsence,    and    that   the     Museum    therefore       was   merely    executing\n\nBüchel’s vision rather than exercising its own artistic judgment to\n\ncreate a new, derivative artwork.\n\n            A derivative work within the meaning of the Copyright Act\n\n\"consists of a contribution of original material to a pre-existing\n\nwork so as to recast, transform or adapt the pre-existing work,\"\n\nand the variation from the original must be \"sufficient to render\n\nthe derivative work distinguishable from its prior work in any\n\nmeaningful manner.\"       Nimmer, supra, § 3.03[A]; see also Schrock v.\n\nLearning Curve Int'l, Inc., 586 F.3d 513, 520-21 (7th Cir. 2009);\n\nWoods v. Bourne Co., 60 F.3d 978, 990 (2d Cir. 1995).                      As we have\n\n\n\n     25\n        Our analysis of the right-of-integrity tarpaulin claim\ndisposes as well of Büchel's contention that covering the\ninstallation constituted a modification of the original work that\nresulted in the creation of a derivative work.\n\n                                       -57-\n\fheld, Büchel's contention that his work was modified without his\n\npermission and to his detriment gives rise to a right-of-integrity\n\nclaim under VARA.    Every modification of a work of art does not,\n\nhowever, result in the creation of a derivative work.\n\n           In Büchel's 52-page opening brief, there is one paragraph\n\nthat purports to analyze the derivative work claim, and that\n\nparagraph itself is largely descriptive rather than analytical.\n\nBüchel cites no cases and does not explain how the modified\n\n\"Training Ground\" was sufficiently original and distinctive within\n\nthe meaning of the Copyright Act to qualify as a derivative work.\n\nHis reply brief adds another paragraph, citing cases, but he again\n\nasserts in summary fashion that the modifications resulted in a\n\nderivative work.    He states that the degree of creativity needed\n\nfor a derivative work is minimal, but does not explain how the\n\nMuseum's alterations create a new work that, as a whole, meets the\n\nCopyright Act's originality requirement.          The law applicable to\n\nderivative work claims, particularly as it intersects with VARA's\n\nprotection for works of     visual art, is complex.    See, e.g., Lee v.\n\nA.R.T. Co., 125 F.3d 580, 582-83 (7th Cir. 1997); Henry Hansmann,\n\nAuthors'   and   Artists'   Moral   Rights:   A   Comparative   Legal     and\n\nEconomic Analysis, 26 J. Legal Stud. 95, 114-116 (1997).         Büchel's\n\nundeveloped argument is so perfunctory that we deem the claim\n\nwaived.    See United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.\n\n1990)   (stating   that,    on   appeal,   \"issues   adverted   to   in    a\n\n\n                                    -58-\n\fperfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed\n\nargumentation, are deemed waived\").\n\n                                        V.\n\n             We summarize our holdings:\n\n             1. VARA's protection of an artist's moral rights extends\n\nto unfinished creations that are \"works of art\" within the meaning\n\nof the Copyright Act;\n\n             2.     The right of integrity under VARA protects artists\n\nfrom distortions, mutilations or modifications of their works that\n\nare prejudicial to their reputation or honor, and prejudice must be\n\nshown for both injunctive relief and damages;\n\n             3.     Büchel has adduced sufficient evidence to raise a\n\ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether MASS MoCA violated his\n\nright   of   integrity      on   one   of    his   three   asserted   bases   for\n\nliability,        namely,   by   modifying     \"Training    Ground\"   over    his\n\nobjections in a manner that harmed his honor or reputation.                   His\n\nright-of-integrity claims based on the yellow tarpaulins and the\n\nmere display of \"Training Ground\" lack merit;\n\n             4.    Büchel's right-of-attribution claim is moot, as VARA\n\nprovides only injunctive relief to protect the right of attribution\n\nand the installation no longer exists;\n\n             5.    The record reveals a genuine issue of material fact\n\nas to whether MASS MoCA violated Büchel's exclusive right under\n\nsection 106(5) of the Copyright Act to display his work publicly;\n\n\n                                       -59-\n\f          6.   Büchel fails to adequately develop his claim that\n\nMASS MoCA violated his exclusive right under section 106(2) to\n\nprepare derivative works based on \"Training Ground,\" and that claim\n\nis therefore waived.\n\n          We thus remand the case for further proceedings on\n\nBüchel’s remaining right-of-integrity claim under VARA and his\n\npublic display claim under section 106 of the Copyright Act.\n\n          Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this decision.   Each party is\n\nto bear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                               -60-\n\f",

Artist Christoph Büchel conceived of an ambitious, football-field-sized art installation entitled \"Training Ground for Democracy,\" which was to be exhibited at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (\"MASS MoCA,\" or \"the Museum\"). Unfortunately, the parties never memorialized the terms of their relationship or their understanding of the intellectual property issues involved in the installation in a written agreement. Even more unfortunately, the project was never completed. Numerous conflicts and a steadily deteriorating relationship between the artist and the Museum prevented the completion of \"Training Ground for Democracy\" in its final form.</p>\n<p>In the wake of this failed endeavor, the Museum went to federal court seeking a declaration that it was \"entitled to present to the public the materials and partial constructions\" it had collected for \"Training Ground for Democracy.\" Büchel responded with several counterclaims under VARA and the Copyright Act,<sup>[1]</sup> seeking an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> injunction that would prevent MASS MoCA from displaying the unfinished installation and damages for the Museum's alleged violations of his rights under both VARA and the general Copyright Act.</p>\n<p>On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court assumed that VARA applies to unfinished works of art, but it nonetheless ruled for the Museum in all respects because, even granting VARA's applicability, it found no genuine issues of material fact. <i>Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art Found., Inc. v. Büchel,</i> 565 F.Supp.2d 245 (D.Mass. 2008). Büchel appeals. Because we find that, if VARA applies, genuine issues of material fact would foreclose summary judgment on one of Büchel's VARA claimsthat MASS MoCA violated his right of artistic integrity by modifying the installationwe cannot assume that VARA applies to unfinished works but instead must decide its applicability. We conclude that the statute does apply to such works.</p>\n<p>We further conclude that, in addition to his VARA claim, Büchel asserts a viable claim under the Copyright Act that MASS MoCA violated his exclusive right to display his work publicly. Accordingly, we reverse in part the grant of summary judgment for MASS MoCA and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Parties</h2>\n<p>MASS MoCA opened in 1999 as a center for the creation and display of contemporary art. The Museum \"seeks to catalyze and support the creation of new art, expose [its] visitors to bold visual and performing art in all stages of production, and re-invigorate the life of a region in socioeconomic need.\" Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, Mission Statement, http://www.massmoca.org/mission.php (last visited Jan. 13, 2010). In its expansive facility in North Adams, Massachusetts, the Museum strives to \"make the whole cloth of art making, presentation and public participation a seamless continuum.\" <i>Id.</i> Over the last decade, the Museum has hosted the production and presentation of over sixty exhibits of visual art, including over 600 works of art by more than 250 individual artists. Some of these works have been displayed in Building 5, the Museum's signature exhibition space, which spans the length of a football field. The Museum strives to \"offer visual artists the tools and time to create works of a scale and duration impossible to realize in the time and space-cramped conditions of most museums,\" and MASS MoCA prides itself on exposing its audiences to \"all stages of art production: rehearsals, sculptural fabrication, and developmental workshops are frequently on view, as are finished works of art.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Christoph Büchel is a Swiss visual artist who lives and works in Basel, Switzerland. He is \"known for building elaborate, politically provocative environments for viewers to wander, and sometimes to crawl, through.\" Randy Kennedy, <i>The Show Will Go On, but the Art Will Be Shielded,</i> N.Y. Times, May 22, 2007, at E1 (\"<i>The Show Will Go On</i>\"). One critic has stated that \"Mr. Büchel's environments are huge in scale,\" \"like bristling three-dimensional history paintings,\" yet are \"so obsessively detailed that they might best be described as panoramic collage.\" Roberta Smith, <i>Is It Art Yet? And Who Decides?,</i> N.Y. Times, Sept. 16, 2007, at 21.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Factual Background</h2>\n<p>Focusing first on those facts that are undisputed, we sketch the course of dealings between Büchel and MASS MoCA to put this appeal in context.<sup>[2]</sup> MASS MoCA <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> became interested in planning a new installation with Büchel. The artist visited the North Adams facility in October 2005 to begin preliminary discussions regarding the project, and those discussions continued into 2006. At some point during this time, Büchel proposed, and the Museum agreed to, a project entitled \"Training Ground for Democracy.\" As Museum Director Joseph Thompson indicated in a letter to Büchel's gallery representatives, MASS MoCA understood that \"Büchel's projects typically require a lengthy period of installation and preparation,\" and that, given the gallery space of Building 5, \"this project [would] be his largest venture to date.\"</p>\n<p>Büchel conceived of the exhibit as \"essentially a village, ... contain[ing] several major architectural and structural elements integrated into a whole, through which a visitor could walk (and climb).\" According to an affidavit submitted to the district court, Büchel envisioned the work in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote>It was to adopt the role-play of U.S. military training for its visitors, who would be given the opportunity to \"virtually\" change their own various identities in relation to the collective project called \"democracy\": training to be an immigrant, training to vote, protest, and revolt, training to loot, training iconoclasm, training to join a political rally, training to be the objects of propaganda, training to be interrogated and detained and to be tried or to judge, training to reconstruct a disaster, training to be in conditions of suspended law, and training various other social and political behavior.</blockquote>\n<p>In August 2006, Büchel spent ten days in residence at MASS MoCA. During this time, he and a partner prepared a basic schematic model of the proposed installation. MASS MoCA agreed to acquire, at Büchel's direction but its own expense, the materials and items necessary for the project.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the parties never formalized the contours of their relationship or firmly established the project's financial scope and precise specifications by executing any written instrument. Although MASS MoCA's curator, Nato Thompson (no relation to the Museum Director),<sup>[3]</sup> sent Büchel's gallery sales representative in the United States a letter on September 14, 2006 that was designed to \"formalize [the parties'] relationship on this project,\" there is no indication that Büchel himself ever saw, much less signed, this proposal.<sup>[4]</sup> The gallery responded with a proposed contract of its own, providing that MASS MoCA should bear the costs of transporting and organizing the various materials for the installation. The Museum did not respond to this proposal. Additionally, it is undisputed that Büchel never signed a document waiving any rights to which he would otherwise be entitled under VARA. The parties did apparently agree, however, that once the planned installation was finished, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> and after the public exhibition period had concluded, MASS MoCA would not contest Büchel's sole title to any copyright in the completed work. The parties set an opening date of December 16, 2006 for the exhibit.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the fall, tensions began to develop between the artist and MASS MoCA employees, particularly Joseph Thompson. \"In summary, the museum felt the artist's directions were vague, and his financial and logistical demands were increasingly unreasonable; the artist felt the museum was compromising his artistic integrity and failing to follow his instructions.\" <i>MASS MoCA,</i> 565 F.Supp.2d at 247. One frequent source of conflict between the parties was the budget, with the Museum understandably concerned about keeping its costs for the massive project under control, and Büchel understandably insistent that his vision for \"Training Ground\" be fully realized. But as the district court correctly noted, \"[t]he dispute about these financial understandings is not material\" to whether Büchel has presented triable claims under either VARA or the Copyright Act, <i>id.</i> at 250, and we therefore need not focus on its messy details.</p>\n<p>Instead, for our purposes, the key conflict between MASS MoCA and the artist involved Büchel's dissatisfaction with the way in which the Museum was implementing his instructions and procuring the items necessary for the installation. Büchel himself was not present in North Adams for the first several months of work on the project. Instead, he conducted much of his work on the installation throughout the fall of 2006 remotely, by providing Museum personnel with detailed instructions as to the particular materials he required and their placement within the exhibition space.</p>\n<p>In the words of the district court, \"[a]t various points in the development of the installation, Büchel proposed several major components,\" some but not all of which later became part of the installation \"as its elements evolved through discussions with MASS MoCA during the construction process.\" <i>Id.</i> These major components included a movie theater, a house, a bar, a mobile home, various sea containers, a bomb carousel, and an aircraft fuselage. <i>Id.</i> The Museum had begun seeking out some of these materials and others for potential use in the installation as soon as Büchel left North Adams at the end of August 2006, and continued to do so throughout the fall. One of the Museum's curators described the search for these items (at Büchel's direction) as \"the ultimate scavenger hunt.\" However, problems soon arose, especially between Thompson and Büchel, as to the progress of the project, particularly when, as Thompson explained in an internal Museum email dated October 28, 2006, he had tried to \"move the project along\" by \"making a few decisions in [Büchel's] stead.\" Thompson noted that Büchel, whom he described as having \"clear vision\" and \"rock solid integrity,\" had taken \"extreme, mortal[] offense\" to Thompson's efforts.</p>\n<p>On October 29, 2006, Büchel returned to North Adams to complete \"Training Ground for Democracy,\" and three of his assistants from Switzerland arrived shortly thereafter. Unhappy with some of the work that had been done by the Museum in his absence, Büchel felt that certain logistical and organizational failures by the Museum had endangered the timely opening of the show. Büchel wrote in an email to Thompson that he would not allow the Museum to open an \"unfinished show in my name, since you are responsible for this major delay.\" By early December 2006, Büchel insisted that the Museum postpone the opening of the show and asserted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> that he would not \"accept an opening of a work in progress or other compromise.\" During the first week of the month, MASS MoCA agreed to delay the opening, posting the following message on its website: \"Due to logistical complexities encountered by the museum in preparing galleries for Christoph Büchel's vast installation, the exhibition's official opening date... will be re-scheduled.\"</p>\n<p>Büchel remained onsite at the Museum working on \"Training Ground\" until December 17, 2006, when he left for the holidays. In Büchel's estimation, \"Training Ground\" was then only about 40% complete. At the time, he planned to return on January 8, 2007, in order to finish the work in time for a March 3 opening. When he left North Adams, the artist was obviously disappointed with the progress of \"Training Ground.\" He called the Museum disorganized and faulted it for underestimating the scope of his project. He felt that Museum employees, by failing to precisely carry out his detailed instructions and making artistic decisions in his stead, had generated even more work for his crew, as numerous components of the installation had to be reworked to Büchel's specifications. In general, he felt that the Museum was trying to scale back his artistic vision without consulting him.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Museum was running out of money for the project. In an attempt to secure further funding, it disregarded Büchel's express wishes and, in late December 2006, asked for money from his galleries. Angry and frustrated, the artist wrote that he would not move forward with the installation until \"all financial problems are solved, regarding ALL elements of the show and until my crew is being sure that they [are] getting paid.\" By mid-January 2007, tensions had escalated to the point where Büchel informed the Museum that he would not return to continue work on \"Training Ground\" unless certain conditions, both financial and artistic, were met.</p>\n<p>In Büchel's absence, MASS MoCA staff continued to work on the installation. The parties disagree as to whether the employees were merely executing instructions left by the artist or whether their actions represented independent artistic judgment, exercised in direct contravention of Büchel's express wishes. The parties also disagree as to whether, in the spring of 2007, while negotiations had stalled but work on the installation was ongoing, the Museum promotedand even showed the unfinished work to numerous visitors without Büchel's consent, in one form or another.</p>\n<p>As the vitriolic exchanges between the parties continued, and negotiations over the project's eventual completion became hopeless, \"Training Ground\" languished in its unfinished state. It became clear that Büchel would not complete the installation. On May 22, 2007, MASS MoCA announced the cancellation of \"Training Ground,\" and contemporaneously publicized the opening of a new exhibit entitled \"Made at MASS MoCA,\" which was to be \"a documentary project exploring the issues raised in the course of complex collaborative projects between artists and institutions.\" Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, Press Release, <i>Presentation of Training Ground for Democracy Cancelled; New Exhibition, Made at MASS MoCA, to Open on Saturday, May 26</i> (\"Press Release\"), available at http://www.massmoca.org/event_details.php?id=144 (May 22, 2007). The press release noted that this lawsuit had been filed the previous day; it also highlighted the Museum's desire to use its \"other experiences working with artists\" to \"provide [its] audience with thought-provoking insights into the complexities of the art-making process.\" <i>Id.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> The release further explained that, due to \"space constraints imposed by the materials assembled for <i>Training Ground for Democracy,</i>\" the exhibition would be presented in the Museum's \"only remaining available gallery space\"; therefore, in order to enter the exhibit, visitors would have to pass through Building 5, \"housing the materials and unfinished fabrications that were to have comprised elements of <i>Training Ground for Democracy.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> The Museum represented that \"[r]easonable steps [had] been taken to control and restrict the view of these materials, pending a court ruling.\"</p>\n<p>When \"Made at MASS MoCA\" opened, many in the art world disagreed with the Museum's handling of its dispute with Büchel, though the parties have different views on whether the Museum's actions ultimately tarnished the artist's reputation. Moreover, the parties differ on whether the \"reasonable steps ... taken to control and restrict the view of the[] materials\" the placement of yellow tarpaulins over the unfinished workactually concealed all of the individual components and vital design elements of \"Training Ground,\" or whether the tarpaulins simply \"hid[] an elephant behind a napkin,\" effectively inviting individuals to peek behind the cloth coverings and view the unfinished work. <i>See</i> Charles Giuliano, <i>Christoph Buchel's Tarp Art at Mass MoCA: Crap Under Wrap</i> (July 31, 2007) (\"<i>Crap Under Wrap</i>\"), <i>available at</i> http://www.berkshirefinearts.com/show_article.php?article_id=368 &amp; category=finearts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Procedural Background</h2>\n<p>The Museum sued Büchel on May 21, 2007, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaint asserted a single claim for declaratory relief under VARA. The Museum sought a declaration that it was \"entitled to present to the public the materials and partial constructions assembled in connection with an exhibit planned with the Swiss artist Büchel.\" Büchel responded by asserting five counterclaims against the Museum. The first sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction under VARA prohibiting the Museum from publicly displaying \"the unfinished Work of Art or any of its component elements.\" The second sought damages for MASS MoCA's alleged violations of Büchel's VARA rights by \"intentionally distort[ing] and modif[ying] the Work of Art\" and allowing members of the public to \"see and pass through\" the unfinished work, both with and without the yellow tarpaulins. The third, fourth and fifth counterclaims sought damages and injunctive relief under the Copyright Act based on alleged violations of Büchel's right to publicly display and create derivative works from his work.</p>\n<p>On MASS MoCA's motion, the court ordered an expedited discovery schedule that included a private viewing by the district court of Building 5 and the unfinished installation. After the close of discovery, both sides filed cross-motions seeking summary judgment on the complaint and all counterclaims. On September 21, 2007, the court held oral argument on the cross-motions and ruled from the bench. That decision addressed only the Museum's original complaint seeking declaratory relief to allow public display of the partially completed project and Büchel's corresponding counterclaim seeking to prevent the Museum from showing the then-existing work. The court ruled in favor of the Museum, noting that nothing in VARA prevented MASS MoCA from showing the incomplete project. Therefore, MASS MoCA was \"entitled to present\" the unfinished installation to the public as long as it posted a disclaimer that would \"inform anyone viewing the exhibit that the materials assembled in Building 5 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> constitute an unfinished project that [did] not carry out the installation's original intent.\" The court correspondingly denied the artist's request for injunctive relief barring public display of the unfinished installation, ruling that he had failed to prove a likelihood of success on the merits of his VARA claim. The court stated that it would \"in the coming weeks\" issue a detailed memorandum explaining its oral rulings and addressing the remaining claims.</p>\n<p>However, several days after obtaining the ruling in its favor, MASS MoCA changed course. The Museum posted an announcement on its website stating that it had \"begun removing materials gathered for <i>Training Ground for Democracy</i> and [would] not permit the public to enter the planned installation.\" MASS MoCA Blog, \"We'll Remove <i>Training Ground,</i>\" http://blog.massmoca.org/2007/09/28/well-remove-training-ground/ (Sept. 28, 2007) (last visited Jan. 13, 2010).</p>\n<p>On July 11, 2008, the district court issued its written opinion, recognizing that some of the issues presented in the case were now moot, but nevertheless wishing to explain its holding and to address the VARA and Copyright Act claims remaining in the case. The court summarized its holding this way:</p>\n<blockquote>When an artist makes a decision to begin work on a piece of art and handles the process of creation long-distance via e-mail, using someone else's property, someone else's materials, someone else's money, someone else's staff, and, to a significant extent, someone else's suggestions regarding the details of fabricationwith no enforceable written or oral contract defining the parties' relationshipand that artist becomes unhappy part-way through the project and abandons it, then nothing in the Visual Artists Rights Act or elsewhere in the Copyright Act gives that artist the right to dictate what that \"someone else\" does with what he has left behind, so long as the remnant is not explicitly labeled as the artist's work. No right of artistic \"attribution\" or \"integrity,\" as those terms are conceived by VARA, is implicated, let alone violated in these circumstances. Similarly, the Copyright Act provides no mechanism for relief, legal or equitable, to an artist such as Defendant Büchel here, based on the decision of an exhibitor such as Plaintiff MASS MoCA to allow patrons to walk past covered components of an unfinished installation.</blockquote>\n<p>565 F.Supp.2d at 248-29. The court therefore granted MASS MoCA's motion for summary judgment and denied Büchel's, entering judgment for the Museum on its claim for declaratory relief as well as on all five of Büchel's counterclaims. Büchel appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Passed in 1990, the Visual Artists Rights Act, 17 U.S.C. § 106A, was an amendment to the Copyright Act that protects the \"moral rights\" of certain visual artists in the works they create, consistent with Article 6<i>bis</i> of the Berne Convention. <i>Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc.,</i> 459 F.3d 128, 133 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc.,</i> 71 F.3d 77, 83 (2d Cir.1995) (citing H.R.Rep. No. 101-514, at 5 (1990) (\"House Report\"), <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6915, 6917).<sup>[5]</sup> The \"rubric <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> of moral rights encompasses many varieties of rights,\" but the two most widely recognized are attribution and integrity. <i>Id.</i> at 81 (citing Ralph E. Lerner &amp; Judith Bresler, <i>Art Law</i> 417, 420 (1989)). We will discuss both of these in detail below, but note briefly now that the right of attribution protects the author's right to be identified as the author of his work and also protects against the use of his name in connection with works created by others. <i>Id.</i> The right of integrity \"allows the author to prevent any deforming or mutilating changes to his work.\" <i>Id.</i> Although these moral rights \"exist independent[ly] of the economic rights\" granted to all authors under the Copyright Act, 5 William F. Patry, <i>Patry on Copyright</i> § 16:1 (2009), they are part of the same statutory framework.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Copyright Act</h2>\n<p>Under the Copyright Act, \"[c]opyright protection subsists ... in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.\" 17 U.S.C. § 102(a). A copyright owner has certain exclusive rights to the work, which are enumerated in 17 U.S.C. § 106. <i>T-Peg, Inc. v. Vermont Timber Works, Inc.,</i> 459 F.3d 97, 108 (1st Cir.2006). Of particular relevance to this litigation, the copyright holder has the exclusive right to publicly display the copyrighted work and to prepare derivative works based upon it. 17 U.S.C. § 106(5), (2). \"One infringes a copyright when he or she violates one of the exclusive rights to a work held by a copyright owner, and the owner has the right to sue for infringement.\" <i>T-Peg, Inc.,</i> 459 F.3d at 108 (citing 17 U.S.C. § 501). The remedies provided by the Copyright Act include injunctive relief and actual or statutory damages. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. §§ 502, 504.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. VARA</h2>\n<p>Beyond the Copyright Act's protections of certain economic rights, VARA provides additional and independent protections to authors of works of visual art. <i>See </i><i>Carter,</i> 71 F.3d at 81-83. A work of visual art is defined to include \"a painting, drawing, print, or sculpture,<sup>[7]</sup> existing in a single copy\" or in a limited edition. 17 U.S.C. § 101. The definition specifically excludes a number of works that are otherwise copyrightable, including motion pictures and other audiovisual works, books, posters, periodicals, works made for hire, and merchandising, advertising, promotional, or packaging materials. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> VARA provides that, in addition to the exclusive rights provided by section 106 of the Copyright Act, but subject to certain limitations, the author of a work of visual art</p>\n<blockquote>(1) shall have the right</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(A) to claim authorship of that work, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of any work of visual art which he or she did not create;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) shall have the right to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of the work of visual art in the event of a distortion, mutilation, or other modification of the work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) subject to the limitations set forth in section 113(d), shall have the right</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(A) to prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification of that work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation, and any intentional distortion, mutilation, or modification of that work is a violation of that right, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) to prevent any destruction of a work of recognized stature, and any intentional or grossly negligent destruction of that work is a violation of that right.</blockquote>\n<p>17 U.S.C. § 106A(a).</p>\n<p>VARA's passage reflected Congress's belief that the art covered by the Act \"meet[s] a special societal need, and [its] protection and preservation serve an important public interest.\" House Report at 5-6, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915-16. To encourage the creation of such art, VARA protects the \"moral rights\" of its creators. These are \"rights of a spiritual, non-economic and personal nature\" that exist \"independently of an artist's copyright in his or her work\" and \"spring from a belief that an artist in the process of creation injects his spirit into the work and that the artist's personality, as well as the integrity of the work, should therefore be protected and preserved.\" <i>Carter,</i> 71 F.3d at 81. The recognition of moral rights fosters a \"`climate of artistic worth and honor that encourages the author in the arduous act of creation.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 83 (quoting House Report at 6, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915). Although an artist may not transfer his VARA rights (as they are considered an extension of his personality), he may waive those rights by \"expressly agree[ing] to such waiver in a written instrument.\" 17 U.S.C. § 106A(e)(1). Also, \"[a]ll remedies available under copyright law, other than criminal remedies, are available in an action for infringement of moral rights.\" <i>Carter,</i> 71 F.3d at 83 (citing 17 U.S.C. § 506); <i>see also</i> 17 U.S.C. § 501(a).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>More specifically, by guaranteeing the moral rights of \"attribution\" and \"integrity,\" VARA \"`protects both the reputations of certain visual artists and the works of art they create.'\" <i>Carter,</i> 71 F.3d at 83 (quoting House Report at 6, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915). Before discussing the precise contours of these rights, we consider whether, as a threshold matter, the indisputably unfinished \"Training Ground for Democracy\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> was a \"work of visual art\" within the meaning of VARA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Does VARA Apply to Unfinished Works of Art?</h2>\n<p>Büchel argues that the district court erred by failing to recognize that VARA applies with equal force to incomplete artistic endeavors that would otherwise be subject to VARA protection. He asserts that the Act's plain language compels such a conclusion, which he claims is confirmed by the legislative history and sparse case law interpreting the statute. The Museum, for its part, does not argue that unfinished works are excluded from VARA's scope. Instead, it interprets the district court's opinion as \"expressly assum[ing]\" that VARA applied to \"Training Ground for Democracy\" in its incomplete state, and then concluding that Büchel had failed to put forth sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue regarding the violation of his rights under the statute.</p>\n<p>We do not read the district court's ruling to conclude categorically that VARA does not apply to unfinished works. Rather, the court held that, if the statute applied, \"display of th[e] unfinished installation would have violated neither Büchel's right of attribution nor his right of integrity.\" 565 F.Supp.2d at 259. Nonetheless, the court repeatedly expressed skepticism about Büchel's claim that the incomplete \"Training Ground\" fell within VARA's scope, observing at one point in its opinion that \"unfinished art may not be covered by VARA at all.\" <i>Id.</i> at 258; <i>see also id.</i> at 259 (\"[I]t is doubtful that VARA even covered the assembled materials that constituted this unfinished installation.\"). Moreover, the court qualified the statute's application to unfinished works: \"To the extent that an artist seeks protection for an uncompleted work, a violation of one of VARA's two explicitly recognized rights must be demonstrated with special clarity.\" <i>Id.</i> at 258.</p>\n<p>Our review of the district court's interpretation of VARA is de novo. <i>Phillips,</i> 459 F.3d at 139. \"`As in all statutory construction cases, we begin with the language of the statute,'\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co.,</i> 534 U.S. 438, 450, 122 S.Ct. 941, 151 L.Ed.2d 908 (2002)), and \"[i]f the meaning of the text is unambiguous our task ends there as well,\" <i>United States v. Godin,</i> 534 F.3d 51, 56 (1st Cir. 2008). \"If the statute's language is plain, the sole function of the courtsat least where the disposition required by the text is not absurdis to enforce it according to its terms.\" <i>In re Rudler,</i> 576 F.3d 37, 44 (1st Cir.2009) (quotation marks and citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The definition of a \"work of visual art\" for VARA purposes is stated \"in terms both positive (what it is) and negative (what it is not).\" <i>Carter,</i> 71 F.3d at 84. An unfinished sculptural installation such as \"Training Ground for Democracy\" is not one of the items specifically excluded from VARA protection,<sup>[9]</sup> and MASS MoCA wisely does not attempt to argue otherwise. Instead, we must determine whether the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> \"positive\" aspect of the definition of \"work of visual art\" includes an <i>unfinished</i> version of a \"sculpture[] existing in a single copy.\" 17 U.S.C. § 101.</p>\n<p>The text of VARA itself does not state when an artistic project becomes a work of visual art subject to its protections. However, VARA is part of the Copyright Act, and that Act's definition section, which defines \"work of visual art,\" specifies that its definitions, unless otherwise provided, control throughout Title 17. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 101. That general definitional section of the Copyright Act states that a work is \"created\" when it \"is fixed in a copy ... for the first time.\" Further, \"where a work is prepared over a period of time, <i>the portion of it that has been fixed at any particular time constitutes the work as of that time.</i>\" 17 U.S.C. § 101 (emphasis added). A work is \"fixed\" when it has been formed, \"by or under the authority of the author,\" in a way that is \"sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, based on section 101's general definitions, courts have held that the Copyright Act's protections extend to unfinished works. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Dumas v. Gommerman,</i> 865 F.2d 1093, 1097 (9th Cir.1989), <i>rejected on other grounds by </i><i>Community for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid,</i> 490 U.S. 730, 739, 742 n. 8, 109 S.Ct. 2166, 104 L.Ed.2d 811 (1989); <i>Zyware, Inc. v. Middlegate, Inc.,</i> No. 96 Civ. 2348(SHS), 1997 WL 685336, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Nov.4, 1997) (noting that there is \"no requirement that a work be complete before it is protected by the Copyright Act\"); <i>Playboy Enters. Inc. v. Dumas,</i> 831 F.Supp. 295, 314 (S.D.N.Y.1993) (\"[T]he [Copyright] Act protects works in progress.\"), <i>modified on other grounds by</i> 840 F.Supp. 256 (S.D.N.Y.1993), <i>aff'd in part, rev'd in part by</i> 53 F.3d 549 (2d Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>Reading VARA in accordance with the definitions in section 101, it too must be read to protect unfinished, but \"fixed,\" works of art that, if completed, would qualify for protection under the statute.<sup>[10]</sup> To conclude otherwise would be \"contrary to the rule that provisions of a single act should be construed in as harmonious a fashion as possible.\" <i>United States v. Maravilla,</i> 907 F.2d 216, 231 (1st Cir.1990) (citation omitted). At least one circuit has previously assumed VARA's applicability to unfinished works. <i>See </i><i>Carter,</i> 71 F.3d at 83-88 (discussing VARA claims stemming from an unfinished, walk-through sculpture being installed in the lobby of a building).<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Our conclusion that the statute's plain language extends its coverage to unfinished works makes it unnecessary to delve into VARA's legislative history. We nonetheless note that we have looked closely at that history, and it fully supports our reading of the plain language. Common sense points in the same direction. Moral rights protect the personality and creative energy that an artist contributes to his or her work. That convergence between artist and artwork does not await the final brush stroke or the placement of the last element in a complex installation. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> <i>See, e.g.,</i> Monica Pa &amp; Christopher J. Robinson, <i>Making Lemons out of Lemons: Recent Developments in the Visual Artists Rights Act,</i> 3 Landslide 22, 24 (Jan./Feb. 2009) (\"[T]he history of art is full of sublime `unfinished' works of art, such as Leonardo da Vinci's <i>Statue of a Horse</i> (begun 1488), Michelangelo's <i>Tomb of Pope Julius II</i> (begun 1505), or El Greco's The <i>Vision of St. John</i> (1608-14).\"); Laura Flahive Wu, <i>Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art v. Büchel: Construing Artists' Rights in the Context of Institutional Commissions,</i> 32 Colum. J.L. &amp; Arts 151, 163 (2008) (noting that \"many works are considered `art' even though they capture creative expression short of an artist's ultimate realization of that expression\").</p>\n<p>We thus hold that VARA protects the moral rights of artists who have \"created\" works of art within the meaning of the Copyright Act even if those works are not yet complete.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>Given Büchel's right to protection under VARA for his artistic investment in a partially completed artwork, we must now assess the district court's ruling that Büchel failed to raise a genuine issue of material fact with respect to any of his claims. We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>Insituform Techs., Inc. v. Am. Home Assur. Co.,</i> 566 F.3d 274, 276 (1st Cir.2009). \"The presence of cross-motions neither dilutes nor distorts this standard of review.\" <i>Scottsdale Ins. Co. v.

The Scope of VARA's Integrity and Attribution Rights</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The Right of Integrity</h2>\n<p>VARA's right of integrity, codified at 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(3)(A), provides that an artist shall have the right \"to prevent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> any intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification of [his or her] work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation, and [that] any intentional distortion, mutilation, or modification of that work is a violation of that right.\" It thus allows artists to protect their works against intentional modifications that would be prejudicial to their honor or reputations. House Report at 6, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>There is arguably some uncertainty about the plaintiff's burden of proof in a case such as this because the second part of section (a)(3)(A)stating that \"any intentional distortion, mutilation, or modification of th[e] work is a violation\" of the right of integritydoes not explicitly require a showing of prejudice when the alteration already has occurred and damages, rather than injunctive relief, would be the appropriate remedy. <i>See</i> 5 Patry, <i>supra,</i> § 16:22 (noting the ambiguity). Because those VARA cases that make it to court are \"generally ... decided on threshold questions such as whether the artist's work is a work of visual art within the scope of the Act,\" Pa &amp; Robinson, <i>supra,</i> at 26, courts have had little occasion to give content to the rights that VARA guarantees. <i>See</i> Wu, <i>supra,</i> at 159 (\"[C]ourts avoid construing the extent of VARA protection by finding that works do not meet the threshold requirements for `visual art' protected by VARA.\"). Unsurprisingly, therefore, we have found no case law discussing a possible difference in the showing required for injunctive relief and damages for right-of-integrity claims.</p>\n<p>Some courts, however, have assumed without analysis that the prejudice showing is necessary for both injunctive relief and damages. <i>See, e.g., Hanrahan v. Ramirez,</i> No. 2:97-CV-7470, 1998 WL 34369997, at *3 (C.D.Cal. June 3, 1998) (citing 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(3)); <i>Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc.,</i> 861 F.Supp. 303, 329-30 (S.D.N.Y.1994), <i>aff'd in part, vacated in part, and rev'd in part by </i><i>Carter,</i> 71 F.3d at 77. At least one commentator likewise accepts, without discussion, that the damages remedy requires a showing of prejudice. <i>See</i> Melville B. Nimmer, 3-8D <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 8D.06[C][1] (noting that \"an intentional and prejudicial mutilation is an integrity violation, remediable through not only an injunction, but damages as well\"). Interestingly, Nimmer raises, and dismisses, a different imprecision in section (a)(3)(A):</p>\n<blockquote>The statutory language\"distortion, mutilation, or other modification of the work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation\"is susceptible of a reading whereby the requisite prejudice applies only to \"modification,\" not to the antecedents of \"distortion\" or \"mutilation.\" Though not without ambiguity, the better view under the Berne Convention, from which this language is drawn, is that prejudice applies in all three instances.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We agree with Nimmer's view of the provision, including the application of the prejudice requirement to a claim for damages, and consider that construction soundly grounded in VARA's legislative history. Under the heading \"Purpose of the Legislation,\" the House Report notes that the right of integrity \"allows artists to protect their works against modifications and destructions that are prejudicial to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> their honor or reputations.\" House Report at 6, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915. The Report also notes that the rights provided by VARA are \"analogous to those protected by Article 6bis of the Berne Convention,\" <i>id.,</i> which in turn describes the right of integrity as applicable to \"certain modifications and other derogatory actions\" that would be prejudicial to the artist's honor or reputation.<sup>[14]</sup> Given the stated purpose of the legislation and the similar depiction of the integrity right in the Berne Convention, we conclude that Congress intended the prejudice requirement to apply to the right of integrity whether the remedy sought is injunctive relief or damages.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Although VARA does not define the terms \"prejudicial,\" \"honor,\" or \"reputation,\" the House Report recommended that the prejudice inquiry \"focus on the artistic or professional honor or reputation of the individual as embodied in the work that is protected,\" and \"examine the way in which a work has been modified and the professional reputation of the author of the work.\" House Report at 15, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6925-26 (footnotes omitted). Relying on dictionary definitions of prejudice, honor and reputation, the district court in <i>Carter</i> concluded that it should \"consider whether [the proposed] alteration would cause injury or damage to plaintiffs' good name, public esteem, or reputation in the artistic community.\" 861 F.Supp. at 323. We think this a useful approach, but emphasize that the focus is on the artist's reputation in relation to the altered work of art; the artist need not have public stature beyond the context of the creation at issue. <i>See</i> House Report at 15, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6925 (\"[A]n author need not prove a preexisting standing in the artistic community.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The Right of Attribution</h2>\n<p>VARA's right of attribution grants the author of a work of visual art the right, in part, (1) \"to claim authorship of that work\"; (2) \"to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of any work of visual art which he or she did not create\"; and (3) \"to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of the work of visual art in the event of a distortion, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> mutilation, or other modification of the work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation.\" 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(1),(2). The right \"ensures that artists are correctly identified with the works of art they create, and that they are not identified with works created by others.\" House Report at 6, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915. In addition, if a work of visual art has been distorted or modified (and, unlike the integrity right, the original distortion or modification need not be intentional), associating the author's name with the distorted work against his wishes would violate his right of attribution.</p>\n<p>The right of attribution under VARA thus gives an artist a claim for injunctive relief to, inter alia, assert or disclaim authorship of a work. Whether VARA entitles an artist to damages for violation of the right of attribution is a separate question. We find the answer in the difference between the statutory language on the right of integrity and the language on the right of attribution. Subsection (a)(3) of section 106A, which codifies the right of integrity, is further divided into two subsections: (A) confers the right to protect the work against intentional alterations that would be prejudicial to honor or reputation, and (B) confers the right to protect a work of \"recognized stature\" from destruction.<sup>[16]</sup> Although both subsections are framed as rights \"to prevent\" certain conduct, they both also contain an additional clause stating that the occurrence of that conduct is, at least in certain circumstances, \"a violation of th[e] right\" to prevent the conduct from happening. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(3)(A) (\"any intentional distortion, mutilation, or modification of that work is a violation of that right\"); <i>id.</i> at § 106(a)(3)(B) (\"any intentional or grossly negligent destruction of that work is a violation of that right\").</p>\n<p>No such \"violation\" clause is included in the sections codifying the right of attribution. <i>See</i> Nimmer, <i>supra,</i> at § 8D.06[B][1] (\"The statute does not make any provision to redress <i>violation</i> of any of the foregoing three attribution rights.\"). The legislative history sheds no light on this difference, but Nimmer speculates as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Perhaps the implication is that whereas an integrity violation could give rise to a monetary recovery, failure to attribute is remediable solely through injunction. If that conclusion were intended, Congress certainly could have expressed its intent less obliquely.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> We agree with Nimmer's surmise that VARA does not provide a damages remedy for an attribution violation. Where the statutory language is framed as a right \"to prevent\" conduct, it does not necessarily follow that a plaintiff is entitled to damages once the conduct occurs. The question is whether \"doing\" the act the artist has a right to prevent also triggers a damages remedy, and the statutory language indicates that Congress answered that question for the attribution right differently from the integrity right.</p>\n<p>It is also noteworthy that Congress crafted a damages remedy for the destruction of a work of recognized stature that is narrower than the right to prevent destruction of such works. While an artist may \"prevent <i>any</i> destruction of a work of recognized stature,\" only an \"intentional or grossly negligent destruction of that work <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> is a violation of that right.\" 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(3)(B) (emphasis added). This narrowing further indicates that Congress did not intend a damages remedy to arise automatically from the right to prevent conduct. In failing to provide a damages remedy for any type of violation of the moral right of attribution, Congress may have concluded that artists could obtain adequate relief for the harms of false attribution by resorting to the Copyright Act and other traditional claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Büchel's VARA Claims</h2>\n<p>With this legal framework in mind, we turn to the record before the district court. By dismantling \"Training Ground,\" the Museum prevented the further use of Büchel's name in connection with the work, eliminating any basis for injunctive relief, and we therefore do not address the attribution claim in our VARA analysis. We thus consider the evidence in the light most favorable to Büchel in determining whether there are genuine issues of material fact regarding the alleged violations of his right of integrity.</p>\n<p>As noted above, the district court concluded that Büchel's right of integrity was not implicated by MASS MoCA's conduct. The court found that \"nothing in MASS MoCA's planned display of the unfinished installation would have violated Büchel's right of integrity, for the simple reason that no completed work of art ever existed on these facts for the museum to distort, mutilate or modify.\" 56 F.Supp.2d at 260. Although the court stated that it would assume that VARA applied to unfinished works, its analysis appears to be influenced by a more limited view of the statute's scope. The court stated that \"[t]o suggest that the display of an unfinished and abandoned work somehow constitutes a distortion, mutilation, or modification of that non-existent work is simply inconsistent with the ordinary usage of those terms.\" <i>Id.</i> Having concluded that VARA applies with full force to unfinished works, however, we cannot accept the district court's reliance on the unfinished state of \"Training Ground\" to minimize the rights of its creator.</p>\n<p>It cannot be disputed that, at least by the time Büchel left North Adams in December 2006, \"Training Ground\" was \"fixed\" within the meaning of the Copyright Acti.e., materials had been placed in Building 5 \"by or under the authority of the author\" in a \"sufficiently permanent or stable\" manner to allow the work to be \"communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.\" 17 U.S.C. § 101. The elements of the installation had been chosen by Büchel, and his assistants and the Museum workers had put numerous components of the project in place under his direct supervision. Although far from complete, the work by the end of 2006 included parts of the \"Saddam Compound\" and the cinema, and Büchel and his assistants had begun detailing several of the containers intended to house elements such as a jail, museum and voting booths. With this substantial work in place, the sculpture had an established presence in Building 5. Büchel thus had rights in the work that were protected under VARA, notwithstanding its unfinished state.</p>\n<p>Büchel alleges that MASS MoCA violated his right to integrity in three distinct ways: first, by continuing to work on the installation without his authorization, particularly in early 2007, and by then exhibiting the distorted artwork to the public; second, by using tarpaulins to \"partially cover[]\"and thus modify and distort the installation, and allowing Museum visitors to see it in that condition; and third, merely by showing Büchel's work in its unfinished state, which he claims was a distortion. Büchel asserts that these actions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> caused prejudice to his honor or reputation.</p>\n<p>As we shall explain, we conclude that summary judgment was improperly granted to MASS MoCA because material disputes of fact exist concerning the first of Büchel's integrity claimsi.e., that MASS MoCA modified \"Training Ground\" over his objections, to his detriment. We further conclude that the record contains sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find that MASS MoCA's actions caused prejudice to Büchel's honor or reputation. The other integrity claims, however, are unavailing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Continuing Work on \"Training Ground\"</h2>\n<p>Büchel asserts that, in the months following his departure from North Adams in December 2006, the Museum encroached on his artistic vision by making modifications to the installation that in some instances were directly contrary to his instructions. In rejecting Büchel's VARA claims, the district court described the Museum's actions as perhaps \"occasionally misguided\" attempts \"to implement Büchel's long-distance instructions.\" 565 F.Supp.2d at 260. The court found that these \"[f]umbled efforts to assist in creating, or failing to create, a work of art are not equivalent to distortion, modification, or mutilation of the art.\" <i>Id.</i> at 260-61.</p>\n<p>Although a jury might agree with the court's assessment, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Büchel would allow a finding that at least some of the Museum's actions violated VARA. The record permits the inference that, even during his time as an artist-in-residence at MASS MoCA, Museum staff members were disregarding his instructions and intentionally modifying \"Training Ground\" in a manner that he did not approve. For example, on December 14, 2006, just before he left for the holidays, Büchel complained to Thompson that in \"many cases people just do stuff without checking back if its ok to do s[omething], when they think by themselves the plan has to be changed.\" Büchel expressed further concerns in an email to Thompson later that month: \"I don't [k]now if this is really a great opportunity when you get an invitation to do a show, where you have to make constantly tons of compromises, where you have to fight constantly against stubborn[n]ess as well [as] against the institution and work with people that think they know my art better than I do as well [as] try to sabotage the project....\"</p>\n<p>In early 2007, when he was no longer on-site, Büchel again accused the Museum of \"sabotage acts\" and, in a January 16 letter, issued an ultimatum: he would return to North Adams to complete \"Training Ground\" only if the Museum assented to a number of specific conditions. Aside from certain budgetary concerns irrelevant here, Büchel included the following among his list of demands:</p>\n<blockquote>There is NO negotiation about the scope of the project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>There are no elements to be eliminated as you propose and I don't accept any orders and any more pressure or compromises how things have to be done, neither from you or your crew....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I will not give you any permission to show an unfinished project nor will I show nor let you show any work in progress, as you proposed already earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I will not accept without consequences any additional sabotage acts, as done to artworks of mine and as well done to the installation in progress[.]</blockquote>\n<p>The letter also identified several points of disagreement with the Museum concerning the content of the project, including Büchel's insistence that there be \"no transport <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> street through the exhibition\" and that he did not \"need to be told if an airplane fuselage section fits in the show or not. I don't negotiate constantly my art with you or Nato....\" Accusing the Museum director of showing \"little respect towards [his] plans,\" he told Thompson \"please don't tell me all the time how I have to do my project regarding its scope and it's [sic] methods that needs [sic] to be applied.\"</p>\n<p>Unsatisfied with the Museum's response to his list of demands, Büchel wrote to Thompson again on January 27, 2007. He warned that, based on the information he had been provided, \"there [was] a lot of stuff not being done according to my instructions.\" Again, he noted several elements of the work that had been installed against his wishes.<sup>[17]</sup> Thompson and Büchel traded emails during the first few days of February, with Büchel stating that he would \"not negotiate further this matter... because almost any of the main conditions are simply not fulfilled\" and Thompson writing that he believed the Museum had \"responded to [Büchel's] main issues.\"</p>\n<p>After that, direct communication between Büchel and the Museum became sparse. It was during this time, Büchel alleges, that the Museum developed a \"Plan B\"<sup>[18]</sup> to be implemented in the eventwhich was looking increasingly likelythat he did not return to finish the exhibit. Plan B, which involved publicly exhibiting the unfinished installation without the artist's permission, called for completing various elements of the installation in a way the Museum knew might differ from Büchel's artistic concept. Büchel cites an email chain on February 14 that included Joseph Thompson and Dante Birch, in which Thompson, stating that the Museum \"seem[ed] to be getting closer and closer to Plan B,\" gave specific instructions on various elements of the installation. Thompson suggested that Museum staff do \"[a]nything else Dante and Nato feel is known with 80% certainty.\"</p>\n<p>At least some Museum staff members recognized that continuing to work on the installation without Büchel's input might be problematic. Later in the February 14 email chain, Dante Birch noted that he was \"interested in protecting the museum from intellectual property issues.\" Pointing out that the show was advertised as a Büchel in the Museum's schedule, he stated that when reviewers came, \"the question will be `what is it?' ... and if it's reviewed as a Buchel we're in deep shit.\" Thompson's plans also raised concern among other MASS MoCA employees, including curator Susan Cross, who cautioned Thompson in a January 31 email that \"we tend to forget that whether we're doing the welding or not, there is an `author'an artist for whom we shouldn't make decisions.... At what point, if at all, does an artist lose his right to owning the idea and his/her `intellectual property?' ... I think it is still art and still belongs to Buchel.\"</p>\n<p>Both in his deposition and in his affidavit, Büchel described ways in which he felt the Museum had knowingly disregarded his specific instructions. For example, MASS MoCA's decision to build a cinderblock wall through the Cape Codstyle house in the installation, despite Büchel's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> expressed desire that the construction await his return, resulted in what Büchel considered a \"big distortion of the meaning of that element.\" The record is replete with similar allegations concerning other components of the installation, including the cinema, the bomb carousel, the Saddam spiderhole, the police car and the mobile home. Indeed, even the Museum, in its August 31, 2007 memorandum of law in support of its motion for summary judgment, admitted that the installation \"[m]aterials as they now stand <i>reflect significant aesthetic and design choices by MASS MoCA personnel,</i> including with respect to the layout of the [m]aterials, and with respect to the selection and procurement of pre-existing buildings and vehicles that have been modified and incorporated into the [m]aterials.\" (Emphasis added.)<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>MASS MoCA argues that the evidence, taken in its entirety, does not add up to a triable issue with respect to a violation of Büchel's right of integrity, but shows only that Museum personnel were attempting to carry out Büchel's vision based on his instructions. Indeed, the Museum notes that the work slowed as Büchel's instructions became unavailable.<sup>[20]</sup> MASS MoCA specifically disputes Büchel's reading of the February 14 email chain as demonstrating the Museum's disregard of his creative rights over the installation, asserting that the discussion among its staff members in fact reflects a conscious effort to determine how far the Museum could appropriately go in light of the remaining instructions left by the artist. In one email, for example, Thompson noted that \"we are putting the correct objects in the spaces cb indicated. ... That's not `doing a buechel [sic]' that's prepping for buechel [sic] assuming, as we still are, that there is some chance we'll see him here again.\" Other communications in the record also could be interpreted as showing the Museum doing its best to carry out Büchel's concept for the art work.</p>\n<p>As we have noted, a jury may well accept the Museum's depiction of its intention and its actions. At this juncture, however, the record must be viewed in the light most favorable to Büchel. The evidence we have described would permit a jury to find that the Museum forged ahead with the installation in the first half of 2007 knowing that the continuing construction in Büchel's absence would frustrate and likely contradictBüchel's artistic vision. We thus conclude that a jury issue exists as to whether these actions effected <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> an intentional distortion or other modification of \"Training Ground\" that subjected MASS MoCA to liability under VARA.</p>\n<p>The record also contains evidence from which a jury could conclude that the Museum's alterations had a detrimental impact on Büchel's honor or reputation. An article in the Boston Globe reported that, in February, Museum officials had shown the unfinished project to a group of Museum directors and curators who were attending an arts conference in the area. <i>See</i> Geoff Edgers, <i>Behind doors, a world unseen: Dispute cloaks massive installation at MASS MoCA,</i> Boston Globe (March 28, 2007), <i>available at</i> www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2007/03/28/behind_doors_a_world_unseen/ (\"<i>Behind doors, a world unseen</i>\"). Another journalist reported on observing the unfinished (and still untarped) work. <i>See The Show Will Go On, supra.</i></p>\n<p>Although the commentary generated by these visits is not all negative,<sup>[21]</sup> there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that the changes to \"Training Ground\" caused prejudice to Büchel. The New York Times noted that the exhibition would \"certainly give people unfamiliar with his obsessive, history-driven aesthetic an inaccurate sense of his art, and this is indeed a form of damage.\" <i>Is It Art Yet?, supra.</i> A critic for the Boston Globe similarly observed that \"many people are going to judge [Büchel] and his work on the basis of this experience.\" Ken Johnson, <i>No admittance: MASS MoCA has mishandled disputed art installation,</i> Boston Globe, July 1, 2007, at 1N. One viewer, writing in <i>Commentary</i> magazine, observed that \"I am not sure that it suffers from being enveiled.\" Michael J. Lewis, <i>The Cost of Transgression,</i> http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/lewis/499 (June 4, 2007). A review published in <i>Berkshire Fine Arts</i>subtitled \"Crap Under Wrap\"concluded that it would be a \"huge mistake\" to uncover the installation, which offered \"virtually nothing of substance or interest.\" <i>Crap Under Wrap, supra.</i></p>\n<p>The record thus shows that some viewers of the installation reacted unfavorably to the work in its allegedly modified and distorted form. A factfinder might conclude, of course, that it was Büchel's underlying concept (notwithstanding its unfinished state) rather than MASS MoCA's actions that elicited the negative reactions. However, a jury could also reasonably infer that the negative impressions resulted from the Museum's unauthorized modifications to \"Training Ground,\" diminishing the quality of the work and thereby harming Büchel's professional honor or reputation as a visual artist.</p>\n<p>In concluding that Büchel has adduced sufficient evidence to support a right-of-integrity claim, we reject the Museum's assertion that to find a violation of Büchel's right of integrity in these circumstances would make it impossible for parties to collaborate on large-scale artistic works. The Museum warns that, under Büchel's interpretation, \"no one other than the artist himself ... may <i>ever</i> perform any work in fabricating visual art unless that specific task has been authorized by the artist.\" We disagree. Although the artist's vision must govern, that principle does not prevent collaboration at the implementation level so long as the artist's vision guides that implementation. Here, Büchel alleges a campaign of intentional distortion and modification to his work in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> which Museum personnel repeatedly ignored his express wishes. Our holding that the summary judgment record precludes an affirmance of the district court on this claim may serve as a cautionary tale to museums contemplating similar installations in the futureguiding them to document the terms of their relationship and obtain VARA waivers where necessarybut it does not prevent museums or other collaborators from working cooperatively with artists on such non-traditional artworks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Showing \"Training Ground\" Covered with Tarpaulins</h2>\n<p>Büchel also claims that MASS MoCA improperly modified and distorted \"Training Ground\" when it partially covered it with the yellow tarpaulins and displayed it in that condition. He asserts that the record shows beyond dispute that visitors looked behind the tarps, that the tarp-adorned installation was \"judged by others to be Büchel's work, and that his honor and reputation were harmed by it.\" In response, the Museum argues that the yellow tarpaulins were merely functionala way of keeping people \"out\" of the installationrather than an aesthetic modification of the artwork that gave MASS MoCA patrons a distorted view of it.</p>\n<p>Although the tarpaulins did prevent visitors to the Museum from seeing the entire unfinished installation, the record shows that a number of people were able to form an impression of \"Training Ground\" despite the partial covering. For example, according to one observer,</p>\n<blockquote>[the tarps] don't reach the floor, and they rise only about two feet above eye level, so they don't cover much. You can easily crouch down to slip your head underneath or peek through the slits between the vinyl sheets. Beyond the passageway formed by the tarps, the monumental elements of the installation rise all around you, plain as daythe cinderblock walls, the two-story house, the guard tower, the trailers, the carnival ride, all compacted together in a claustrophobic, politically surreal borough of hell, George Orwell by way of David Lynch.</blockquote>\n<p>Thomas Micchelli, <i>Christoph Büchel Training Ground for Democracy,</i> The Brooklyn Rail (September 2007), <i>available at</i> http://www.brooklynrail.org/2007/09/artseen/buchel. Another critic noted that the installation \"under all the tarps is really kind of a conceptual peep show. It doesn't take much effort or imagination to see most of the work.... Mass MoCA is hiding an elephant behind a napkin,\" and called it a \"wink, wink, wrap show.\" <i>Crap Under Wrap, supra.</i> Photographs in the record confirm that the covers did not obscure the general path and layout of the installation. Indeed, given the location of \"Training Ground,\" visitors to \"Made at MASS MoCA\" could not avoid seeing the unfinished \"Training Ground\" bedecked in tarpaulins.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, although the installation unquestionably looked different with the tarpaulins partially covering it, we agree with the district court that the mere covering of the artwork by the Museum, its host, cannot reasonably be deemed an intentional act of distortion or modification of Büchel's creation. To conclude otherwise would be to say that, even if all had gone well, the Museum would have been subject to a right-of-integrity claim if it had partially covered the work before its formal opening to prevent visitors from seeing it prematurely.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that MASS MoCA was necessarily acting with pure intentions when it created \"Made at MASS MoCA\" in close proximity to the tarped \"Training Ground.\" It might be a fair inference that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> the Museum was deliberately communicating its anger with Büchel by juxtaposing his unfinished work with the successful artistic collaborations depicted in its new exhibition. The partial covering of \"Training Ground\" may have been intended to highlight, rather than hide, the failed collaboration.<sup>[22]</sup> The right of integrity under VARA, however, protects the artist from distortions of his work, not from disparaging commentary about his behavior. In our view, a finding that the Museum's covering of the installation constituted an intentional act of distortion or modification of Büchel's artistic creation would stretch VARA beyond sensible boundaries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Exhibiting \"Training Ground\" in Its Unfinished State</h2>\n<p>Büchel maintains that, even aside from the alleged modifications to \"Training Ground,\" merely exhibiting the work of art in its unfinished state, without the artist's consent, constitutes a distortion. We reject this claim. A separate moral right of disclosure (also known as the right of divulgation) protects an author's authority to \"prevent third parties from disclosing [his or her] work to the public without the author's consent,\" and is not covered by VARA. <i>See</i> Cyrill P. Rigamonti, <i>Deconstructing Moral Rights,</i> 47 Harv. Int'l L.J. 353, 373, 405 (2006) \"([T]he VARA ignores the rights of disclosure and withdrawal and instead focuses on the rights of attribution and integrity....\").</p>\n<p>Although Büchel proffered an expert who opined that showing an unfinished work without the artist's permission is inherently a distortion, we decline to interpret VARA to include such a claim where a separate moral right of disclosure is widely recognized in other jurisdictions and Congress explicitly limited the statute's coverage to the rights of attribution and integrity. <i>See</i> Amy M. Adler, <i>Against Moral Rights,</i> 97 Cal. L.Rev. 263, 268 (2009) (noting that most European countries \"recognize a right of divulgation, giving the artist the right to decide when (and whether) the work is complete and can be shown\"); Rigamonti, <i>supra,</i> at 356 (\"The standard set of moral rights recognized in the literature consists of the author's right to claim authorship (right of attribution), the right to object to modifications of the work (right of integrity), the right to decide when and how the work in question will be published (right of disclosure), and the right to withdraw a work after publication (right of withdrawal).\" (footnotes omitted)); 5 <i>Patry on Copyright</i> § 16:23 (noting that VARA does not give the artist \"a right to prohibit display of mutilated versions of his or her work, only the right to prohibit the mutilation itself\"). Any right Büchel possesses to withhold display of his artwork must be found outside VARA. We consider below his claim to such a right under section 106(5) of the Copyright Act. <i>See infra</i> Section IV.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Summary of VARA Claims</h2>\n<p>After careful review of the record, we are persuaded that a reasonable jury could find that Büchel is entitled to relief under VARA based on the Museum's continuing work on \"Training Ground\" over his objections. Genuine disputes of material fact foreclose summary judgment for either Büchel or MASS MoCA on that claim. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> We find no merit, however, in Büchel's claim that MASS MoCA intentionally modified or distorted \"Training Ground\" by covering it with tarpaulins, and we reject as outside the scope of the statute Büchel's claim that the Museum violated VARA by displaying the installation over his objections. We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment for the Museum on Büchel's right-of-attribution claim, which became moot when MASS MoCA dismantled the installation in 2007.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>We now assess Büchel's challenge to the grant of summary judgment for MASS MoCA on his Copyright Act claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Public Display</h2>\n<p>The owner of a copyrighted work has the exclusive right to \"display the copyrighted work publicly.\" 17 U.S.C. § 106(5). Displaying a work is defined as \"show[ing] a copy of it, either directly or by means of a film, slide, television image, or any other device or process.\" 17 U.S.C. § 101. A \"copy\" includes the original. <i>Id.</i> Büchel argued below, as he does on appeal, that the Museum's repeated public exhibitions of \"Training Ground for Democracy\" constituted a public display of his work in violation of his exclusive right under section 106(5). The district court gave no explicit reason for its dismissal of this claim, remarking only that \"[f]or the reasons already stated,\" presumably in its discussion of VARA, MASS MoCA was \"entitled to judgment on this count.\" 565 F.Supp.2d at 261.</p>\n<p>The court also remarked, however, that since Büchel \"would have suffered a violation of no right recognized by this statute, this messy situation simply fell outside the boundary of VARA and, a fortiori, outside the more general provisions of the Copyright Act.\" <i>Id.</i> at 260. This statement reflects a misreading of the Copyright Act. As we have explained, the moral rights granted to specific artists under VARA are separate and independent from the economic rights guaranteed by section 106. 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a) (providing that rights of attribution and integrity are \"independent of the exclusive rights provided in section 106\"). Thus, the inadequacy of claims under VARA does not, on its own, signify the inadequacy of more traditional copyright claims. <i>See</i> Wu, <i>supra,</i> at 164 (observing that VARA has \"acquired the attributes of a false talisman,\" both because artists overly rely on it in \"instances where economic rights, including traditional rights of copyright provided by Section 106 ... would more effectively protect their interests\" and also because courts tend to view VARA claims as \"devalu[ing] entitlements to economic rights pleaded in tandem with VARA claims\").</p>\n<p>We thus turn specifically to this claim. The Museum argues that Büchel has failed to present a triable issue of fact on his claim under section 106(5) because the unfinished work was never publicly displayed. However, as we have described in the context of our VARA discussion, there is significant record evidence suggesting that the work was repeatedly and deliberately exhibited to numerous individuals.<sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p>MASS MoCA also asserts an affirmative defense under section 109(c), which provides that \"the owner of a particular copy lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> owner, to display that copy publicly.\" 17 U.S.C. § 109(c). The Museum argues that it owned the physical copy of \"Training Ground,\" and that section 109(c) therefore permitted it to display the unfinished work. Here again, however, the record reveals disputed issues of fact with respect to whether the Museum's copy was \"lawfully made,\" as it may have been created in violation of the artist's rights under VARA. Moreover, Büchel introduced evidence to rebut the Museum's assertion that \"the installation's various components\" all belonged to, or were purchased by, MASS MoCA. Finally, Büchel presented evidence that the Museum understood that the physical copy of the installation belonged to him.<sup>[24]</sup> Accordingly, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Büchel, we cannot say that a reasonable jury could not conclude that the Museum violated his exclusive right to publicly display \"Training Ground for Democracy.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Derivative Works</h2>\n<p>The Copyright Act also grants artists the exclusive right to \"prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.\" 17 U.S.C. § 106(2). A derivative work is defined as one \"based upon one or more preexisting works,\" such as a translation, musical arrangement, fictionalization, \"or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted.\" 17 U.S.C. § 101. A derivative work includes any work \"consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship.\" <i>Id.</i> Büchel brought two claims based on this provision, asserting that MASS MoCA created unauthorized derivative works based on the installation itself and on the work's models and plans.</p>\n<p>The district court ruled that, \"[e]ven assuming that the stumbling, and eventually abandoned, process of collaboration during 2006 produced an original work of art subject to copyright protection, which is highly doubtful, clearly no `derivative' work of art was created by MASS MoCA's attempt (however flawed) to play its part in this process.\" 565 F.Supp.2d at 261. It further rejected Büchel's argument that, by placing tarpaulins over the unfinished installation, the Museum created a separate, unauthorized derivative work. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>On appeal, Büchel summarily argues that what the Museum displayed in Building 5, both with and without the yellow tarpaulins, \"recast\" or \"transformed\" the work that he had originally set out in his plans and left behind in December 2006, thus creating derivative works under the Copyright Act.<sup>[25]</sup> In response, MASS MoCA again argues that its staff was following Büchel's instructions when working on \"Training Ground\" in his absence, and that the Museum therefore was merely executing Büchel's vision rather than exercising its own artistic judgment to create a new, derivative artwork.</p>\n<p>A derivative work within the meaning of the Copyright Act \"consists of a contribution <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> of original material to a pre-existing work so as to recast, transform or adapt the pre-existing work,\" and the variation from the original must be \"sufficient to render the derivative work distinguishable from its prior work in any meaningful manner.\" Nimmer, <i>supra,</i> § 3.03[A]; <i>see also </i><i>Schrock v. Learning Curve Int'l, Inc.,</i> 586 F.3d 513, 520-21 (7th Cir.2009); <i>Woods v. Bourne Co.,</i> 60 F.3d 978, 990 (2d Cir.1995). As we have held, Büchel's contention that his work was modified without his permission and to his detriment gives rise to a right-of-integrity claim under VARA. Every modification of a work of art does not, however, result in the creation of a derivative work.</p>\n<p>In Büchel's 52-page opening brief, there is one paragraph that purports to analyze the derivative work claim, and that paragraph itself is largely descriptive rather than analytical. Büchel cites no cases and does not explain how the modified \"Training Ground\" was sufficiently original and distinctive within the meaning of the Copyright Act to qualify as a derivative work. His reply brief adds another paragraph, citing cases, but he again asserts in summary fashion that the modifications resulted in a derivative work. He states that the degree of creativity needed for a derivative work is minimal, but does not explain how the Museum's alterations create a new work that, as a whole, meets the Copyright Act's originality requirement. The law applicable to derivative work claims, particularly as it intersects with VARA's protection for works of visual art, is complex. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Lee v. A.R.T. Co.,</i> 125 F.3d 580, 582-83 (7th Cir.1997); Henry Hansmann, <i>Authors' and Artists' Moral Rights: A Comparative Legal and Economic Analysis,</i> 26 J. Legal Stud. 95, 114-116 (1997). Büchel's undeveloped argument is so perfunctory that we deem the claim waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (stating that, on appeal, \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>We summarize our holdings:</p>\n<p>1. VARA's protection of an artist's moral rights extends to unfinished creations that are \"works of art\" within the meaning of the Copyright Act;</p>\n<p>2. The right of integrity under VARA protects artists from distortions, mutilations or modifications of their works that are prejudicial to their reputation or honor, and prejudice must be shown for both injunctive relief and damages;</p>\n<p>3. Büchel has adduced sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether MASS MoCA violated his right of integrity on one of his three asserted bases for liability, namely, by modifying \"Training Ground\" over his objections in a manner that harmed his honor or reputation. His right-of-integrity claims based on the yellow tarpaulins and the mere display of \"Training Ground\" lack merit;</p>\n<p>4. Büchel's right-of-attribution claim is moot, as VARA provides only injunctive relief to protect the right of attribution and the installation no longer exists;</p>\n<p>5. The record reveals a genuine issue of material fact as to whether MASS MoCA violated Büchel's exclusive right under section 106(5) of the Copyright Act to display his work publicly;</p>\n<p>6. Büchel fails to adequately develop his claim that MASS MoCA violated his exclusive right under section 106(2) to prepare derivative works based on \"Training Ground,\" and that claim is therefore waived.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> We thus remand the case for further proceedings on Büchel's remaining right-of-integrity claim under VARA and his public display claim under section 106 of the Copyright Act.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Each party is to bear its own costs.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  VARA was enacted as an amendment to the Copyright Act. <i>See infra</i> Section II.</p>\n<p>[2]  We consider the parties' conflicting accounts of the key evidence in our summary judgment analysis, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>[3]  Throughout the opinion, any reference to \"Thompson\" without a first name will refer to Museum Director Joseph Thompson. Nato Thompson will be identified by his full name.</p>\n<p>[4]  The letter, signed by Museum Director Joseph Thompson, was attached to an email sent by Nato Thompson. The proposal did not lay out a definitive budget for the project, although in a separate letter to Büchel the following day, Joseph Thompson stated \"we think we've got a $160,000 project on our hands in direct costs.\" In a reply email dated September 24, 2006, Büchel did not explicitly agree to or reject the $160,000 figure, but suggested that MASS MoCA get in touch with his two galleries, which might provide information regarding \"potential sponsors like foundations\" for the installation.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Berne convention, developed at the instigation of Victor Hugo and first adopted in Berne, Switzerland in 1886, is \"`an international copyright treaty providing that works created by citizens of one signatory nation will be fully protected in other signatory nations, without the need for local formalities.'\" <i>Phillips,</i> 459 F.3d at 133 n. 3 (quoting <i>Black's Law Dictionary,</i> 8th ed. (1999)).</p>\n<p>[6]  Under the Copyright Act, a plaintiff may elect to recover statutory damages instead of actual damages for each work infringed \"in a sum of not less than $750 or more than $30,000 as the court considers just.\" 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1). If the copyright owner proves that the infringement was committed willfully, the court \"in its discretion\" may increase the award of statutory damages to \"a sum of not more than $150,000.\" <i>Id.</i> at 504(c)(2). The award may also be reduced to $200 if the infringer proves that he or she was not aware \"and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[7]  The parties do not dispute that, if completed, \"Training Ground for Democracy\" would have been a sculpture and therefore a qualified \"work of visual art\" under VARA. Furthermore, VARA's legislative history states that \"[t]he term `sculpture' includes, but is not limited to, castings, carvings, modelings, and <i>constructions.\"</i> House Report at 11 (1990), <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6921 (emphasis added). The Second Circuit in <i>Carter</i> similarly considered VARA's application to a \"very large `walk-through sculpture' occupying most, but not all, of [a] building's lobby.\" 71 F.3d at 80; <i>see also id.</i> at 84 (\"Concededly, considered as a whole, the work is a sculpture and exists only in a single copy.\").</p>\n<p>[8]  Section 501(a) states, in relevant part, that \"[a]nyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner ... or of the author as provided in section 106A(a) [VARA]... is an infringer of the copyright or right of the author, as the case may be.\" The provision further states that, with the exception of the criminal penalties provided under section 506, \"any reference to copyright shall be deemed to include the rights conferred by section 106A(a).\"</p>\n<p>[9]  As provided in 17 U.S.C. § 106A(c)(3), VARA specifically excludes certain categories of artwork listed in section 101 of the Copyright Act:\n</p>\n<p>(A) (i) any poster, map, globe, chart, technical drawing, diagram, model, applied art, motion picture or other audiovisual work, book, magazine, newspaper, periodical, data base, electronic information service, electronic publication, or similar publication;</p>\n<p>(ii) any merchandising item or advertising, promotional, descriptive, covering, or packaging material or container;</p>\n<p>(iii) any portion or part of any item described in clause (i) or (ii);</p>\n<p>(B) any work made for hire</p>\n<p>17 U.S.C. § 101.</p>\n<p>[10]  Nothing in the language of VARA or the definitions provision of the Copyright Act permits distinct treatment for the rights of copyright owners whose works are complete and those whose works are still in progress. We therefore reject the \"special clarity\" standard articulated by the district court for proving a violation of an artist's VARA rights in an unfinished work of art.</p>\n<p>[11]  The Second Circuit ultimately found that the sculpture was exempted from VARA protections because it was a \"work for hire.\" <i>See</i> 71 F.3d at 86-88.</p>\n<p>[12]  Our decision in <i>Phillips</i> is not inconsistent with this holding. In <i>Phillips,</i> we held that VARA did not apply to site-specific works of art, in which the particular location of the artwork is one of its physical elements and removal of the artwork destroys it. 459 F.3d at 140. We observed that VARA does not explicitly address protection for site-specific works despite the impact of such works on real property interests, <i>id.</i> at 142, and we declined to interpret VARA in a way that was neither supported by the statutory language nor sensible as policy. <i>See id.</i> at 142-43. Here, the plain language controls, and there is no conflict with \"`long-established and familiar principles'\" of the common law. <i>Id.</i> at 142 (quoting <i>United States v. Texas,</i> 507 U.S. 529, 534, 113 S.Ct. 1631, 123 L.Ed.2d 245 (1993)).</p>\n<p>[13]  In some jurisdictions, the right of integrity also generally protects artwork from destruction. <i>See </i><i>Carter,</i> 71 F.3d at 81. In the United States, however, VARA protects only works of \"recognized stature\" from destruction. 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(3)(B). That right is not implicated in this case.</p>\n<p>[14]  Article 6<i>bis</i> of the Berne Convention, which is titled \"Moral Rights,\" includes a heading that lists among those rights \"to object to certain modifications and other derogatory actions.\" The provision itself states, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>(1) Independently of the author's economic rights, and even after the transfer of the said rights, the author shall have the right... to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of, or other derogatory action in relation to, the said work, which would be prejudicial to his honor or reputation.</p>\n<p>Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works art. 6<i>bis,</i> Sept. 9, 1986, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99-27, 1161 U.N.T.S. 30.</p>\n<p>[15]  Based on revisions to the statutory language made during the legislative process, Patry concludes that \"where an intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification has already occurred, the plaintiff need not prove harm to his or her honor or reputation.\" 5 Patry, <i>supra,</i> § 16:22. He further states, without supporting citation, that \"[i]t was understood informally\" that the final version of the provision was designed \"to permit a cause of action ... without the need for proof that the artist's honor or reputation was harmed.\" <i>Id.</i> To the extent Patry's conclusion is that no evidence of harm is necessary, we reject it as inconsistent with the available legislative history, as discussed above. It may be, however, that Congress's concern was only that a plaintiff not be required to prove the actual amount of damage to reputation, but could opt for the statutory damages remedy upon showing prejudice. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. §§ 501(a), 504(c) (stating that a VARA plaintiff may elect to recover statutory damages instead of actual damages and profits).</p>\n<p>[16]  Section 106A(a)(3) states that the author of a work of visual art shall have the right \"(A) to prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification of that work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation\" and the right \"(B) to prevent any destruction of a work of recognized stature.\"</p>\n<p>[17]  \"I wrote very clearly immediately to [Dante Birch, the Museum's production manager] not to use the method we talked about and stop it ..., as well cinder block walls have to be partly redone that have been built without my instruction....\"</p>\n<p>[18]  The term \"Plan B\" appears in the record in a February 14, 2007 email from Thompson to other Museum staff.</p>\n<p>[19]  This assertion by MASS MoCA was made to support its contention, rejected by the district court and halfheartedly renewed on appeal, that the unfinished installation might constitute a joint work of Büchel and the Museum. A claim of joint authorship requires proof that the parties \"entertain in their minds the concept of joint ownership.\" <i>Thomson v. Larson,</i> 147 F.3d 195, 201 (2d Cir.1998) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, multiple facts indicate that the parties' understanding from the outset was that \"Training Ground\" was solely a Christoph Büchel work of art. The Museum's December 6, 2006 postponement announcement described the work as \"Christoph Büchel's vast installation\" and, as reflected in the emails described above, Museum personnel internally recognized Büchel as the artist, at least as \"Training Ground\" was originally conceived. It is also undisputed that, at the outset of their relationship, the parties had agreed that Büchel alone would hold the copyright in the finished work. These facts negate any claim of joint authorship.</p>\n<p>[20]  In his deposition, Thompson testified as follows:\n</p>\n<p>[T]here was a whole long list of things for which we had adequate direction and understanding that we could continue forward to a certain point. When the work began to get very detailed and would require input from Christoph, if we could get the input from him, we would continue, and if we didn't, we would stop.</p>\n<p>[21]  Thompson told an outside consultant for the Museum in March 2007 that a curator at the New Museum in New York had just viewed the installation \"and said it was one of the best works he's seen in the past three years.\"</p>\n<p>[22]  Indeed, the Boston Globe's art critic, Ken Johnson, described the exhibit as a \"self-serving photo and text display\" that implicitly conveys criticism of Büchel for the failure of \"Training Ground for Democracy.\" <i>See MASS MoCA has Mishandled Disputed Art Installation, supra.</i> The juxtaposition left Johnson with the impression that MASS MoCA was \"exacting revenge\" against the artist \"by turning his project into a show that misrepresents, dishonors, vilifies, and even ridicules him.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[23]  In addition to the journalists and Museum personnel noted earlier, a newspaper reported that the mayor of North Adams had seen the exhibit twice, once with Governor Deval Patrick. <i>See Behind doors, a world unseen, supra.</i></p>\n<p>[24]  For example, in an email sent on September 11, 2006 to curator Nato Thompson, the Museum's director (Joseph Thompson) said: \"I assume you've already laid out the general idea [to Büchel] (we build it, and it belongs to you),\" and also noted that Büchel had the right to \"sell all or part of it.\" The Museum's proposed contract, which was never signed, would have conferred ownership on Büchel. It stated that, \"[u]pon termination of the exhibition, the fabricated work shall be owned outright by you, including all copyrights and related preparatory materials.\"</p>\n<p>[25]  Our analysis of the right-of-integrity tarpaulin claim disposes as well of Büchel's contention that covering the installation constituted a modification of the original work that resulted in the creation of a derivative work.</p>\n\n</div>",

Artist Christoph Büchel conceived of an ambitious, football-field-sized art installation entitled \"Training Ground for Democracy,\" which was to be exhibited at the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art (\"MASS MoCA,\" or \"the Museum\"). Unfortunately, the parties never memorialized the terms of their relationship or their understanding of the intellectual property issues involved in the installation in a written agreement. Even more unfortunately, the project was never completed. Numerous conflicts and a steadily deteriorating relationship between the artist and the Museum prevented the completion of \"Training Ground for Democracy\" in its final form.</p>\n<p>In the wake of this failed endeavor, the Museum went to federal court seeking a declaration that it was \"entitled to present to the public the materials and partial constructions\" it had collected for \"Training Ground for Democracy.\" Büchel responded with several counterclaims under VARA and the Copyright Act,<sup>[1]</sup> seeking an <span class=\"star-pagination\">*42</span> injunction that would prevent MASS MoCA from displaying the unfinished installation and damages for the Museum's alleged violations of his rights under both VARA and the general Copyright Act.</p>\n<p>On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court assumed that VARA applies to unfinished works of art, but it nonetheless ruled for the Museum in all respects because, even granting VARA's applicability, it found no genuine issues of material fact. <i>Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art Found., Inc. v.

Because we find that, if VARA applies, genuine issues of material fact would foreclose summary judgment on one of Büchel's VARA claimsthat MASS MoCA violated his right of artistic integrity by modifying the installationwe cannot assume that VARA applies to unfinished works but instead must decide its applicability. We conclude that the statute does apply to such works.</p>\n<p>We further conclude that, in addition to his VARA claim, Büchel asserts a viable claim under the Copyright Act that MASS MoCA violated his exclusive right to display his work publicly. Accordingly, we reverse in part the grant of summary judgment for MASS MoCA and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Parties</h2>\n<p>MASS MoCA opened in 1999 as a center for the creation and display of contemporary art. The Museum \"seeks to catalyze and support the creation of new art, expose [its] visitors to bold visual and performing art in all stages of production, and re-invigorate the life of a region in socioeconomic need.\" Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, Mission Statement, http://www.massmoca.org/mission.php (last visited Jan. 13, 2010). In its expansive facility in North Adams, Massachusetts, the Museum strives to \"make the whole cloth of art making, presentation and public participation a seamless continuum.\" <i>Id.</i> Over the last decade, the Museum has hosted the production and presentation of over sixty exhibits of visual art, including over 600 works of art by more than 250 individual artists. Some of these works have been displayed in Building 5, the Museum's signature exhibition space, which spans the length of a football field. The Museum strives to \"offer visual artists the tools and time to create works of a scale and duration impossible to realize in the time and space-cramped conditions of most museums,\" and MASS MoCA prides itself on exposing its audiences to \"all stages of art production: rehearsals, sculptural fabrication, and developmental workshops are frequently on view, as are finished works of art.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Christoph Büchel is a Swiss visual artist who lives and works in Basel, Switzerland. He is \"known for building elaborate, politically provocative environments for viewers to wander, and sometimes to crawl, through.\" Randy Kennedy, <i>The Show Will Go On, but the Art Will Be Shielded,</i> N.Y. Times, May 22, 2007, at E1 (\"<i>The Show Will Go On</i>\"). One critic has stated that \"Mr. Büchel's environments are huge in scale,\" \"like bristling three-dimensional history paintings,\" yet are \"so obsessively detailed that they might best be described as panoramic collage.\" Roberta Smith, <i>Is It Art Yet? And Who Decides?,</i> N.Y. Times, Sept. 16, 2007, at 21.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Factual Background</h2>\n<p>Focusing first on those facts that are undisputed, we sketch the course of dealings between Büchel and MASS MoCA to put this appeal in context.<sup>[2]</sup> MASS MoCA <span class=\"star-pagination\">*43</span> became interested in planning a new installation with Büchel. The artist visited the North Adams facility in October 2005 to begin preliminary discussions regarding the project, and those discussions continued into 2006. At some point during this time, Büchel proposed, and the Museum agreed to, a project entitled \"Training Ground for Democracy.\" As Museum Director Joseph Thompson indicated in a letter to Büchel's gallery representatives, MASS MoCA understood that \"Büchel's projects typically require a lengthy period of installation and preparation,\" and that, given the gallery space of Building 5, \"this project [would] be his largest venture to date.\"</p>\n<p>Büchel conceived of the exhibit as \"essentially a village, ... contain[ing] several major architectural and structural elements integrated into a whole, through which a visitor could walk (and climb).\" According to an affidavit submitted to the district court, Büchel envisioned the work in the following way:</p>\n<blockquote>It was to adopt the role-play of U.S. military training for its visitors, who would be given the opportunity to \"virtually\" change their own various identities in relation to the collective project called \"democracy\": training to be an immigrant, training to vote, protest, and revolt, training to loot, training iconoclasm, training to join a political rally, training to be the objects of propaganda, training to be interrogated and detained and to be tried or to judge, training to reconstruct a disaster, training to be in conditions of suspended law, and training various other social and political behavior.</blockquote>\n<p>In August 2006, Büchel spent ten days in residence at MASS MoCA. During this time, he and a partner prepared a basic schematic model of the proposed installation. MASS MoCA agreed to acquire, at Büchel's direction but its own expense, the materials and items necessary for the project.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, the parties never formalized the contours of their relationship or firmly established the project's financial scope and precise specifications by executing any written instrument. Although MASS MoCA's curator, Nato Thompson (no relation to the Museum Director),<sup>[3]</sup> sent Büchel's gallery sales representative in the United States a letter on September 14, 2006 that was designed to \"formalize [the parties'] relationship on this project,\" there is no indication that Büchel himself ever saw, much less signed, this proposal.<sup>[4]</sup> The gallery responded with a proposed contract of its own, providing that MASS MoCA should bear the costs of transporting and organizing the various materials for the installation. The Museum did not respond to this proposal. Additionally, it is undisputed that Büchel never signed a document waiving any rights to which he would otherwise be entitled under VARA. The parties did apparently agree, however, that once the planned installation was finished, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*44</span> and after the public exhibition period had concluded, MASS MoCA would not contest Büchel's sole title to any copyright in the completed work. The parties set an opening date of December 16, 2006 for the exhibit.</p>\n<p>Over the course of the fall, tensions began to develop between the artist and MASS MoCA employees, particularly Joseph Thompson. \"In summary, the museum felt the artist's directions were vague, and his financial and logistical demands were increasingly unreasonable; the artist felt the museum was compromising his artistic integrity and failing to follow his instructions.\" <i>MASS MoCA,</i> 565 F.Supp.2d at 247. One frequent source of conflict between the parties was the budget, with the Museum understandably concerned about keeping its costs for the massive project under control, and Büchel understandably insistent that his vision for \"Training Ground\" be fully realized. But as the district court correctly noted, \"[t]he dispute about these financial understandings is not material\" to whether Büchel has presented triable claims under either VARA or the Copyright Act, <i>id.</i> at 250, and we therefore need not focus on its messy details.</p>\n<p>Instead, for our purposes, the key conflict between MASS MoCA and the artist involved Büchel's dissatisfaction with the way in which the Museum was implementing his instructions and procuring the items necessary for the installation. Büchel himself was not present in North Adams for the first several months of work on the project. Instead, he conducted much of his work on the installation throughout the fall of 2006 remotely, by providing Museum personnel with detailed instructions as to the particular materials he required and their placement within the exhibition space.</p>\n<p>In the words of the district court, \"[a]t various points in the development of the installation, Büchel proposed several major components,\" some but not all of which later became part of the installation \"as its elements evolved through discussions with MASS MoCA during the construction process.\" <i>Id.</i> These major components included a movie theater, a house, a bar, a mobile home, various sea containers, a bomb carousel, and an aircraft fuselage. <i>Id.</i> The Museum had begun seeking out some of these materials and others for potential use in the installation as soon as Büchel left North Adams at the end of August 2006, and continued to do so throughout the fall. One of the Museum's curators described the search for these items (at Büchel's direction) as \"the ultimate scavenger hunt.\" However, problems soon arose, especially between Thompson and Büchel, as to the progress of the project, particularly when, as Thompson explained in an internal Museum email dated October 28, 2006, he had tried to \"move the project along\" by \"making a few decisions in [Büchel's] stead.\" Thompson noted that Büchel, whom he described as having \"clear vision\" and \"rock solid integrity,\" had taken \"extreme, mortal[] offense\" to Thompson's efforts.</p>\n<p>On October 29, 2006, Büchel returned to North Adams to complete \"Training Ground for Democracy,\" and three of his assistants from Switzerland arrived shortly thereafter. Unhappy with some of the work that had been done by the Museum in his absence, Büchel felt that certain logistical and organizational failures by the Museum had endangered the timely opening of the show. Büchel wrote in an email to Thompson that he would not allow the Museum to open an \"unfinished show in my name, since you are responsible for this major delay.\" By early December 2006, Büchel insisted that the Museum postpone the opening of the show and asserted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> that he would not \"accept an opening of a work in progress or other compromise.\" During the first week of the month, MASS MoCA agreed to delay the opening, posting the following message on its website: \"Due to logistical complexities encountered by the museum in preparing galleries for Christoph Büchel's vast installation, the exhibition's official opening date... will be re-scheduled.\"</p>\n<p>Büchel remained onsite at the Museum working on \"Training Ground\" until December 17, 2006, when he left for the holidays. In Büchel's estimation, \"Training Ground\" was then only about 40% complete. At the time, he planned to return on January 8, 2007, in order to finish the work in time for a March 3 opening. When he left North Adams, the artist was obviously disappointed with the progress of \"Training Ground.\" He called the Museum disorganized and faulted it for underestimating the scope of his project. He felt that Museum employees, by failing to precisely carry out his detailed instructions and making artistic decisions in his stead, had generated even more work for his crew, as numerous components of the installation had to be reworked to Büchel's specifications. In general, he felt that the Museum was trying to scale back his artistic vision without consulting him.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, the Museum was running out of money for the project. In an attempt to secure further funding, it disregarded Büchel's express wishes and, in late December 2006, asked for money from his galleries. Angry and frustrated, the artist wrote that he would not move forward with the installation until \"all financial problems are solved, regarding ALL elements of the show and until my crew is being sure that they [are] getting paid.\" By mid-January 2007, tensions had escalated to the point where Büchel informed the Museum that he would not return to continue work on \"Training Ground\" unless certain conditions, both financial and artistic, were met.</p>\n<p>In Büchel's absence, MASS MoCA staff continued to work on the installation. The parties disagree as to whether the employees were merely executing instructions left by the artist or whether their actions represented independent artistic judgment, exercised in direct contravention of Büchel's express wishes. The parties also disagree as to whether, in the spring of 2007, while negotiations had stalled but work on the installation was ongoing, the Museum promotedand even showed the unfinished work to numerous visitors without Büchel's consent, in one form or another.</p>\n<p>As the vitriolic exchanges between the parties continued, and negotiations over the project's eventual completion became hopeless, \"Training Ground\" languished in its unfinished state. It became clear that Büchel would not complete the installation. On May 22, 2007, MASS MoCA announced the cancellation of \"Training Ground,\" and contemporaneously publicized the opening of a new exhibit entitled \"Made at MASS MoCA,\" which was to be \"a documentary project exploring the issues raised in the course of complex collaborative projects between artists and institutions.\" Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, Press Release, <i>Presentation of Training Ground for Democracy Cancelled; New Exhibition, Made at MASS MoCA, to Open on Saturday, May 26</i> (\"Press Release\"), available at http://www.massmoca.org/event_details.php?id=144 (May 22, 2007). The press release noted that this lawsuit had been filed the previous day; it also highlighted the Museum's desire to use its \"other experiences working with artists\" to \"provide [its] audience with thought-provoking insights into the complexities of the art-making process.\" <i>Id.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> The release further explained that, due to \"space constraints imposed by the materials assembled for <i>Training Ground for Democracy,</i>\" the exhibition would be presented in the Museum's \"only remaining available gallery space\"; therefore, in order to enter the exhibit, visitors would have to pass through Building 5, \"housing the materials and unfinished fabrications that were to have comprised elements of <i>Training Ground for Democracy.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> The Museum represented that \"[r]easonable steps [had] been taken to control and restrict the view of these materials, pending a court ruling.\"</p>\n<p>When \"Made at MASS MoCA\" opened, many in the art world disagreed with the Museum's handling of its dispute with Büchel, though the parties have different views on whether the Museum's actions ultimately tarnished the artist's reputation. Moreover, the parties differ on whether the \"reasonable steps ... taken to control and restrict the view of the[] materials\" the placement of yellow tarpaulins over the unfinished workactually concealed all of the individual components and vital design elements of \"Training Ground,\" or whether the tarpaulins simply \"hid[] an elephant behind a napkin,\" effectively inviting individuals to peek behind the cloth coverings and view the unfinished work. <i>See</i> Charles Giuliano, <i>Christoph Buchel's Tarp Art at Mass MoCA: Crap Under Wrap</i> (July 31, 2007) (\"<i>Crap Under Wrap</i>\"), <i>available at</i> http://www.berkshirefinearts.com/show_article.php?article_id=368 &amp; category=finearts.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Procedural Background</h2>\n<p>The Museum sued Büchel on May 21, 2007, in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The complaint asserted a single claim for declaratory relief under VARA. The Museum sought a declaration that it was \"entitled to present to the public the materials and partial constructions assembled in connection with an exhibit planned with the Swiss artist Büchel.\" Büchel responded by asserting five counterclaims against the Museum. The first sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction under VARA prohibiting the Museum from publicly displaying \"the unfinished Work of Art or any of its component elements.\" The second sought damages for MASS MoCA's alleged violations of Büchel's VARA rights by \"intentionally distort[ing] and modif[ying] the Work of Art\" and allowing members of the public to \"see and pass through\" the unfinished work, both with and without the yellow tarpaulins. The third, fourth and fifth counterclaims sought damages and injunctive relief under the Copyright Act based on alleged violations of Büchel's right to publicly display and create derivative works from his work.</p>\n<p>On MASS MoCA's motion, the court ordered an expedited discovery schedule that included a private viewing by the district court of Building 5 and the unfinished installation. After the close of discovery, both sides filed cross-motions seeking summary judgment on the complaint and all counterclaims. On September 21, 2007, the court held oral argument on the cross-motions and ruled from the bench. That decision addressed only the Museum's original complaint seeking declaratory relief to allow public display of the partially completed project and Büchel's corresponding counterclaim seeking to prevent the Museum from showing the then-existing work. The court ruled in favor of the Museum, noting that nothing in VARA prevented MASS MoCA from showing the incomplete project. Therefore, MASS MoCA was \"entitled to present\" the unfinished installation to the public as long as it posted a disclaimer that would \"inform anyone viewing the exhibit that the materials assembled in Building 5 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> constitute an unfinished project that [did] not carry out the installation's original intent.\" The court correspondingly denied the artist's request for injunctive relief barring public display of the unfinished installation, ruling that he had failed to prove a likelihood of success on the merits of his VARA claim. The court stated that it would \"in the coming weeks\" issue a detailed memorandum explaining its oral rulings and addressing the remaining claims.</p>\n<p>However, several days after obtaining the ruling in its favor, MASS MoCA changed course. The Museum posted an announcement on its website stating that it had \"begun removing materials gathered for <i>Training Ground for Democracy</i> and [would] not permit the public to enter the planned installation.\" MASS MoCA Blog, \"We'll Remove <i>Training Ground,</i>\" http://blog.massmoca.org/2007/09/28/well-remove-training-ground/ (Sept. 28, 2007) (last visited Jan. 13, 2010).</p>\n<p>On July 11, 2008, the district court issued its written opinion, recognizing that some of the issues presented in the case were now moot, but nevertheless wishing to explain its holding and to address the VARA and Copyright Act claims remaining in the case. The court summarized its holding this way:</p>\n<blockquote>When an artist makes a decision to begin work on a piece of art and handles the process of creation long-distance via e-mail, using someone else's property, someone else's materials, someone else's money, someone else's staff, and, to a significant extent, someone else's suggestions regarding the details of fabricationwith no enforceable written or oral contract defining the parties' relationshipand that artist becomes unhappy part-way through the project and abandons it, then nothing in the Visual Artists Rights Act or elsewhere in the Copyright Act gives that artist the right to dictate what that \"someone else\" does with what he has left behind, so long as the remnant is not explicitly labeled as the artist's work. No right of artistic \"attribution\" or \"integrity,\" as those terms are conceived by VARA, is implicated, let alone violated in these circumstances. Similarly, the Copyright Act provides no mechanism for relief, legal or equitable, to an artist such as Defendant Büchel here, based on the decision of an exhibitor such as Plaintiff MASS MoCA to allow patrons to walk past covered components of an unfinished installation.</blockquote>\n<p>565 F.Supp.2d at 248-29. The court therefore granted MASS MoCA's motion for summary judgment and denied Büchel's, entering judgment for the Museum on its claim for declaratory relief as well as on all five of Büchel's counterclaims. Büchel appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Passed in 1990, the Visual Artists Rights Act, 17 U.S.C. § 106A, was an amendment to the Copyright Act that protects the \"moral rights\" of certain visual artists in the works they create, consistent with Article 6<i>bis</i> of the Berne Convention. <i>Phillips v. Pembroke Real Estate, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202371\"><a href=\"/opinion/202371/phillips-v-pembroke-real-estate/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">128</span></a></span>, 133 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709039\"><a href=\"/opinion/709039/john-carter-john-swing-and-john-veronis/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">77</span></a></span>, 83 (2d Cir.1995) (citing H.R.Rep. No. 101-514, at 5 (1990) (\"House Report\"), <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6915, 6917).<sup>[5]</sup> The \"rubric <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> of moral rights encompasses many varieties of rights,\" but the two most widely recognized are attribution and integrity. <i>Id.</i> at 81 (citing Ralph E. Lerner &amp; Judith Bresler, <i>Art Law</i> 417, 420 (1989)). We will discuss both of these in detail below, but note briefly now that the right of attribution protects the author's right to be identified as the author of his work and also protects against the use of his name in connection with works created by others. <i>Id.</i> The right of integrity \"allows the author to prevent any deforming or mutilating changes to his work.\" <i>Id.</i> Although these moral rights \"exist independent[ly] of the economic rights\" granted to all authors under the Copyright Act, 5 William F. Patry, <i>Patry on Copyright</i> § 16:1 (2009), they are part of the same statutory framework.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Copyright Act</h2>\n<p>Under the Copyright Act, \"[c]opyright protection subsists ... in original works of authorship fixed in any tangible medium of expression.\" 17 U.S.C. § 102(a). A copyright owner has certain exclusive rights to the work, which are enumerated in 17 U.S.C. § 106. <i>T-Peg, Inc. v. Vermont Timber Works, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202362\"><a href=\"/opinion/202362/t-peg-inc-v-vermont-timber/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">97</span></a></span>, 108 (1st Cir.2006). Of particular relevance to this litigation, the copyright holder has the exclusive right to publicly display the copyrighted work and to prepare derivative works based upon it. 17 U.S.C. § 106(5), (2). \"One infringes a copyright when he or she violates one of the exclusive rights to a work held by a copyright owner, and the owner has the right to sue for infringement.\" <i>T-Peg, Inc.,</i> 459 F.3d at 108 (citing 17 U.S.C. § 501). The remedies provided by the Copyright Act include injunctive relief and actual or statutory damages. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. §§ 502, 504.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. VARA</h2>\n<p>Beyond the Copyright Act's protections of certain economic rights, VARA provides additional and independent protections to authors of works of visual art. <i>See </i><i>Carter,</i> 71 F.3d at 81-83. A work of visual art is defined to include \"a painting, drawing, print, or sculpture,<sup>[7]</sup> existing in a single copy\" or in a limited edition. 17 U.S.C. § 101. The definition specifically excludes a number of works that are otherwise copyrightable, including motion pictures and other audiovisual works, books, posters, periodicals, works made for hire, and merchandising, advertising, promotional, or packaging materials. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> VARA provides that, in addition to the exclusive rights provided by section 106 of the Copyright Act, but subject to certain limitations, the author of a work of visual art</p>\n<blockquote>(1) shall have the right</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(A) to claim authorship of that work, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of any work of visual art which he or she did not create;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) shall have the right to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of the work of visual art in the event of a distortion, mutilation, or other modification of the work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) subject to the limitations set forth in section 113(d), shall have the right</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(A) to prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification of that work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation, and any intentional distortion, mutilation, or modification of that work is a violation of that right, and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(B) to prevent any destruction of a work of recognized stature, and any intentional or grossly negligent destruction of that work is a violation of that right.</blockquote>\n<p>17 U.S.C. § 106A(a).</p>\n<p>VARA's passage reflected Congress's belief that the art covered by the Act \"meet[s] a special societal need, and [its] protection and preservation serve an important public interest.\" House Report at 5-6, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915-16. To encourage the creation of such art, VARA protects the \"moral rights\" of its creators. These are \"rights of a spiritual, non-economic and personal nature\" that exist \"independently of an artist's copyright in his or her work\" and \"spring from a belief that an artist in the process of creation injects his spirit into the work and that the artist's personality, as well as the integrity of the work, should therefore be protected and preserved.\" <i>Carter,</i> 71 F.3d at 81. The recognition of moral rights fosters a \"`climate of artistic worth and honor that encourages the author in the arduous act of creation.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 83 (quoting House Report at 6, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915). Although an artist may not transfer his VARA rights (as they are considered an extension of his personality), he may waive those rights by \"expressly agree[ing] to such waiver in a written instrument.\" 17 U.S.C. § 106A(e)(1). Also, \"[a]ll remedies available under copyright law, other than criminal remedies, are available in an action for infringement of moral rights.\" <i>Carter,</i> 71 F.3d at 83 (citing 17 U.S.C. § 506); <i>see also</i> 17 U.S.C. § 501(a).<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>More specifically, by guaranteeing the moral rights of \"attribution\" and \"integrity,\" VARA \"`protects both the reputations of certain visual artists and the works of art they create.'\" <i>Carter,</i> 71 F.3d at 83 (quoting House Report at 6, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915). Before discussing the precise contours of these rights, we consider whether, as a threshold matter, the indisputably unfinished \"Training Ground for Democracy\" <span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> was a \"work of visual art\" within the meaning of VARA.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Does VARA Apply to Unfinished Works of Art?</h2>\n<p>Büchel argues that the district court erred by failing to recognize that VARA applies with equal force to incomplete artistic endeavors that would otherwise be subject to VARA protection. He asserts that the Act's plain language compels such a conclusion, which he claims is confirmed by the legislative history and sparse case law interpreting the statute. The Museum, for its part, does not argue that unfinished works are excluded from VARA's scope. Instead, it interprets the district court's opinion as \"expressly assum[ing]\" that VARA applied to \"Training Ground for Democracy\" in its incomplete state, and then concluding that Büchel had failed to put forth sufficient evidence to raise a triable issue regarding the violation of his rights under the statute.</p>\n<p>We do not read the district court's ruling to conclude categorically that VARA does not apply to unfinished works. Rather, the court held that, if the statute applied, \"display of th[e] unfinished installation would have violated neither Büchel's right of attribution nor his right of integrity.\" 565 F.Supp.2d at 259. Nonetheless, the court repeatedly expressed skepticism about Büchel's claim that the incomplete \"Training Ground\" fell within VARA's scope, observing at one point in its opinion that \"unfinished art may not be covered by VARA at all.\" <i>Id.</i> at 258; <i>see also id.</i> at 259 (\"[I]t is doubtful that VARA even covered the assembled materials that constituted this unfinished installation.\"). Moreover, the court qualified the statute's application to unfinished works: \"To the extent that an artist seeks protection for an uncompleted work, a violation of one of VARA's two explicitly recognized rights must be demonstrated with special clarity.\" <i>Id.</i> at 258.</p>\n<p>Our review of the district court's interpretation of VARA is de novo. <i>Phillips,</i> 459 F.3d at 139. \"`As in all statutory construction cases, we begin with the language of the statute,'\" <i>id.</i> (quoting <i>Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145120\"><a href=\"/opinion/145120/barnhart-v-sigmon-coal-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">534</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">438</span></a></span>, 450, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145120\"><a href=\"/opinion/145120/barnhart-v-sigmon-coal-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

An unfinished sculptural installation such as \"Training Ground for Democracy\" is not one of the items specifically excluded from VARA protection,<sup>[9]</sup> and MASS MoCA wisely does not attempt to argue otherwise. Instead, we must determine whether the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> \"positive\" aspect of the definition of \"work of visual art\" includes an <i>unfinished</i> version of a \"sculpture[] existing in a single copy.\" 17 U.S.C. § 101.</p>\n<p>The text of VARA itself does not state when an artistic project becomes a work of visual art subject to its protections. However, VARA is part of the Copyright Act, and that Act's definition section, which defines \"work of visual art,\" specifies that its definitions, unless otherwise provided, control throughout Title 17. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 101. That general definitional section of the Copyright Act states that a work is \"created\" when it \"is fixed in a copy ... for the first time.\" Further, \"where a work is prepared over a period of time, <i>the portion of it that has been fixed at any particular time constitutes the work as of that time.</i>\" 17 U.S.C. § 101 (emphasis added). A work is \"fixed\" when it has been formed, \"by or under the authority of the author,\" in a way that is \"sufficiently permanent or stable to permit it to be perceived, reproduced, or otherwise communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Not surprisingly, based on section 101's general definitions, courts have held that the Copyright Act's protections extend to unfinished works. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Dumas v.

At least one circuit has previously assumed VARA's applicability to unfinished works. <i>See </i><i>Carter,</i> 71 F.3d at 83-88 (discussing VARA claims stemming from an unfinished, walk-through sculpture being installed in the lobby of a building).<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p>Our conclusion that the statute's plain language extends its coverage to unfinished works makes it unnecessary to delve into VARA's legislative history. We nonetheless note that we have looked closely at that history, and it fully supports our reading of the plain language. Common sense points in the same direction. Moral rights protect the personality and creative energy that an artist contributes to his or her work.

The Scope of VARA's Integrity and Attribution Rights</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. The Right of Integrity</h2>\n<p>VARA's right of integrity, codified at 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(3)(A), provides that an artist shall have the right \"to prevent <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> any intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification of [his or her] work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation, and [that] any intentional distortion, mutilation, or modification of that work is a violation of that right.\" It thus allows artists to protect their works against intentional modifications that would be prejudicial to their honor or reputations. House Report at 6, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915.<sup>[13]</sup></p>\n<p>There is arguably some uncertainty about the plaintiff's burden of proof in a case such as this because the second part of section (a)(3)(A)stating that \"any intentional distortion, mutilation, or modification of th[e] work is a violation\" of the right of integritydoes not explicitly require a showing of prejudice when the alteration already has occurred and damages, rather than injunctive relief, would be the appropriate remedy. <i>See</i> 5 Patry, <i>supra,</i> § 16:22 (noting the ambiguity). Because those VARA cases that make it to court are \"generally ... decided on threshold questions such as whether the artist's work is a work of visual art within the scope of the Act,\" Pa &amp; Robinson, <i>supra,</i> at 26, courts have had little occasion to give content to the rights that VARA guarantees. <i>See</i> Wu, <i>supra,</i> at 159 (\"[C]ourts avoid construing the extent of VARA protection by finding that works do not meet the threshold requirements for `visual art' protected by VARA.\"). Unsurprisingly, therefore, we have found no case law discussing a possible difference in the showing required for injunctive relief and damages for right-of-integrity claims.</p>\n<p>Some courts, however, have assumed without analysis that the prejudice showing is necessary for both injunctive relief and damages. <i>See, e.g., Hanrahan v. Ramirez,</i> No. 2:97-CV-7470, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">34369997</span></span>, at *3 (C.D.Cal. June 3, 1998) (citing 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(3)); <i>Carter v. Helmsley-Spear, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2261919\"><a href=\"/opinion/2261919/carter-v-helmsley-spear-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">861</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

At least one commentator likewise accepts, without discussion, that the damages remedy requires a showing of prejudice. <i>See</i> Melville B. Nimmer, 3-8D <i>Nimmer on Copyright</i> § 8D.06[C][1] (noting that \"an intentional and prejudicial mutilation is an integrity violation, remediable through not only an injunction, but damages as well\"). Interestingly, Nimmer raises, and dismisses, a different imprecision in section (a)(3)(A):</p>\n<blockquote>The statutory language\"distortion, mutilation, or other modification of the work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation\"is susceptible of a reading whereby the requisite prejudice applies only to \"modification,\" not to the antecedents of \"distortion\" or \"mutilation.\" Though not without ambiguity, the better view under the Berne Convention, from which this language is drawn, is that prejudice applies in all three instances.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We agree with Nimmer's view of the provision, including the application of the prejudice requirement to a claim for damages, and consider that construction soundly grounded in VARA's legislative history. Under the heading \"Purpose of the Legislation,\" the House Report notes that the right of integrity \"allows artists to protect their works against modifications and destructions that are prejudicial to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> their honor or reputations.\" House Report at 6, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915. The Report also notes that the rights provided by VARA are \"analogous to those protected by Article 6bis of the Berne Convention,\" <i>id.,</i> which in turn describes the right of integrity as applicable to \"certain modifications and other derogatory actions\" that would be prejudicial to the artist's honor or reputation.<sup>[14]</sup> Given the stated purpose of the legislation and the similar depiction of the integrity right in the Berne Convention, we conclude that Congress intended the prejudice requirement to apply to the right of integrity whether the remedy sought is injunctive relief or damages.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p>Although VARA does not define the terms \"prejudicial,\" \"honor,\" or \"reputation,\" the House Report recommended that the prejudice inquiry \"focus on the artistic or professional honor or reputation of the individual as embodied in the work that is protected,\" and \"examine the way in which a work has been modified and the professional reputation of the author of the work.\" House Report at 15, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6925-26 (footnotes omitted). Relying on dictionary definitions of prejudice, honor and reputation, the district court in <i>Carter</i> concluded that it should \"consider whether [the proposed] alteration would cause injury or damage to plaintiffs' good name, public esteem, or reputation in the artistic community.\" 861 F.Supp. at 323. We think this a useful approach, but emphasize that the focus is on the artist's reputation in relation to the altered work of art; the artist need not have public stature beyond the context of the creation at issue. <i>See</i> House Report at 15, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6925 (\"[A]n author need not prove a preexisting standing in the artistic community.\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. The Right of Attribution</h2>\n<p>VARA's right of attribution grants the author of a work of visual art the right, in part, (1) \"to claim authorship of that work\"; (2) \"to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of any work of visual art which he or she did not create\"; and (3) \"to prevent the use of his or her name as the author of the work of visual art in the event of a distortion, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*55</span> mutilation, or other modification of the work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation.\" 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(1),(2). The right \"ensures that artists are correctly identified with the works of art they create, and that they are not identified with works created by others.\" House Report at 6, <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6915. In addition, if a work of visual art has been distorted or modified (and, unlike the integrity right, the original distortion or modification need not be intentional), associating the author's name with the distorted work against his wishes would violate his right of attribution.</p>\n<p>The right of attribution under VARA thus gives an artist a claim for injunctive relief to, inter alia, assert or disclaim authorship of a work. Whether VARA entitles an artist to damages for violation of the right of attribution is a separate question. We find the answer in the difference between the statutory language on the right of integrity and the language on the right of attribution. Subsection (a)(3) of section 106A, which codifies the right of integrity, is further divided into two subsections: (A) confers the right to protect the work against intentional alterations that would be prejudicial to honor or reputation, and (B) confers the right to protect a work of \"recognized stature\" from destruction.<sup>[16]</sup> Although both subsections are framed as rights \"to prevent\" certain conduct, they both also contain an additional clause stating that the occurrence of that conduct is, at least in certain circumstances, \"a violation of th[e] right\" to prevent the conduct from happening. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(3)(A) (\"any intentional distortion, mutilation, or modification of that work is a violation of that right\"); <i>id.</i> at § 106(a)(3)(B) (\"any intentional or grossly negligent destruction of that work is a violation of that right\").</p>\n<p>No such \"violation\" clause is included in the sections codifying the right of attribution. <i>See</i> Nimmer, <i>supra,</i> at § 8D.06[B][1] (\"The statute does not make any provision to redress <i>violation</i> of any of the foregoing three attribution rights.\"). The legislative history sheds no light on this difference, but Nimmer speculates as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>Perhaps the implication is that whereas an integrity violation could give rise to a monetary recovery, failure to attribute is remediable solely through injunction. If that conclusion were intended, Congress certainly could have expressed its intent less obliquely.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> We agree with Nimmer's surmise that VARA does not provide a damages remedy for an attribution violation. Where the statutory language is framed as a right \"to prevent\" conduct, it does not necessarily follow that a plaintiff is entitled to damages once the conduct occurs. The question is whether \"doing\" the act the artist has a right to prevent also triggers a damages remedy, and the statutory language indicates that Congress answered that question for the attribution right differently from the integrity right.</p>\n<p>It is also noteworthy that Congress crafted a damages remedy for the destruction of a work of recognized stature that is narrower than the right to prevent destruction of such works. While an artist may \"prevent <i>any</i> destruction of a work of recognized stature,\" only an \"intentional or grossly negligent destruction of that work <span class=\"star-pagination\">*56</span> is a violation of that right.\" 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(3)(B) (emphasis added). This narrowing further indicates that Congress did not intend a damages remedy to arise automatically from the right to prevent conduct. In failing to provide a damages remedy for any type of violation of the moral right of attribution, Congress may have concluded that artists could obtain adequate relief for the harms of false attribution by resorting to the Copyright Act and other traditional claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Büchel's VARA Claims</h2>\n<p>With this legal framework in mind, we turn to the record before the district court. By dismantling \"Training Ground,\" the Museum prevented the further use of Büchel's name in connection with the work, eliminating any basis for injunctive relief, and we therefore do not address the attribution claim in our VARA analysis. We thus consider the evidence in the light most favorable to Büchel in determining whether there are genuine issues of material fact regarding the alleged violations of his right of integrity.</p>\n<p>As noted above, the district court concluded that Büchel's right of integrity was not implicated by MASS MoCA's conduct. The court found that \"nothing in MASS MoCA's planned display of the unfinished installation would have violated Büchel's right of integrity, for the simple reason that no completed work of art ever existed on these facts for the museum to distort, mutilate or modify.\" 56 F.Supp.2d at 260. Although the court stated that it would assume that VARA applied to unfinished works, its analysis appears to be influenced by a more limited view of the statute's scope. The court stated that \"[t]o suggest that the display of an unfinished and abandoned work somehow constitutes a distortion, mutilation, or modification of that non-existent work is simply inconsistent with the ordinary usage of those terms.\" <i>Id.</i> Having concluded that VARA applies with full force to unfinished works, however, we cannot accept the district court's reliance on the unfinished state of \"Training Ground\" to minimize the rights of its creator.</p>\n<p>It cannot be disputed that, at least by the time Büchel left North Adams in December 2006, \"Training Ground\" was \"fixed\" within the meaning of the Copyright Acti.e., materials had been placed in Building 5 \"by or under the authority of the author\" in a \"sufficiently permanent or stable\" manner to allow the work to be \"communicated for a period of more than transitory duration.\" 17 U.S.C. § 101. The elements of the installation had been chosen by Büchel, and his assistants and the Museum workers had put numerous components of the project in place under his direct supervision. Although far from complete, the work by the end of 2006 included parts of the \"Saddam Compound\" and the cinema, and Büchel and his assistants had begun detailing several of the containers intended to house elements such as a jail, museum and voting booths. With this substantial work in place, the sculpture had an established presence in Building 5. Büchel thus had rights in the work that were protected under VARA, notwithstanding its unfinished state.</p>\n<p>Büchel alleges that MASS MoCA violated his right to integrity in three distinct ways: first, by continuing to work on the installation without his authorization, particularly in early 2007, and by then exhibiting the distorted artwork to the public; second, by using tarpaulins to \"partially cover[]\"and thus modify and distort the installation, and allowing Museum visitors to see it in that condition; and third, merely by showing Büchel's work in its unfinished state, which he claims was a distortion. Büchel asserts that these actions <span class=\"star-pagination\">*57</span> caused prejudice to his honor or reputation.</p>\n<p>As we shall explain, we conclude that summary judgment was improperly granted to MASS MoCA because material disputes of fact exist concerning the first of Büchel's integrity claimsi.e., that MASS MoCA modified \"Training Ground\" over his objections, to his detriment. We further conclude that the record contains sufficient evidence to allow a jury to find that MASS MoCA's actions caused prejudice to Büchel's honor or reputation. The other integrity claims, however, are unavailing.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Continuing Work on \"Training Ground\"</h2>\n<p>Büchel asserts that, in the months following his departure from North Adams in December 2006, the Museum encroached on his artistic vision by making modifications to the installation that in some instances were directly contrary to his instructions. In rejecting Büchel's VARA claims, the district court described the Museum's actions as perhaps \"occasionally misguided\" attempts \"to implement Büchel's long-distance instructions.\" 565 F.Supp.2d at 260. The court found that these \"[f]umbled efforts to assist in creating, or failing to create, a work of art are not equivalent to distortion, modification, or mutilation of the art.\" <i>Id.</i> at 260-61.</p>\n<p>Although a jury might agree with the court's assessment, the evidence viewed in the light most favorable to Büchel would allow a finding that at least some of the Museum's actions violated VARA. The record permits the inference that, even during his time as an artist-in-residence at MASS MoCA, Museum staff members were disregarding his instructions and intentionally modifying \"Training Ground\" in a manner that he did not approve. For example, on December 14, 2006, just before he left for the holidays, Büchel complained to Thompson that in \"many cases people just do stuff without checking back if its ok to do s[omething], when they think by themselves the plan has to be changed.\" Büchel expressed further concerns in an email to Thompson later that month: \"I don't [k]now if this is really a great opportunity when you get an invitation to do a show, where you have to make constantly tons of compromises, where you have to fight constantly against stubborn[n]ess as well [as] against the institution and work with people that think they know my art better than I do as well [as] try to sabotage the project....\"</p>\n<p>In early 2007, when he was no longer on-site, Büchel again accused the Museum of \"sabotage acts\" and, in a January 16 letter, issued an ultimatum: he would return to North Adams to complete \"Training Ground\" only if the Museum assented to a number of specific conditions. Aside from certain budgetary concerns irrelevant here, Büchel included the following among his list of demands:</p>\n<blockquote>There is NO negotiation about the scope of the project.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>There are no elements to be eliminated as you propose and I don't accept any orders and any more pressure or compromises how things have to be done, neither from you or your crew....</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I will not give you any permission to show an unfinished project nor will I show nor let you show any work in progress, as you proposed already earlier.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>I will not accept without consequences any additional sabotage acts, as done to artworks of mine and as well done to the installation in progress[.]</blockquote>\n<p>The letter also identified several points of disagreement with the Museum concerning the content of the project, including Büchel's insistence that there be \"no transport <span class=\"star-pagination\">*58</span> street through the exhibition\" and that he did not \"need to be told if an airplane fuselage section fits in the show or not. I don't negotiate constantly my art with you or Nato....\" Accusing the Museum director of showing \"little respect towards [his] plans,\" he told Thompson \"please don't tell me all the time how I have to do my project regarding its scope and it's [sic] methods that needs [sic] to be applied.\"</p>\n<p>Unsatisfied with the Museum's response to his list of demands, Büchel wrote to Thompson again on January 27, 2007. He warned that, based on the information he had been provided, \"there [was] a lot of stuff not being done according to my instructions.\" Again, he noted several elements of the work that had been installed against his wishes.<sup>[17]</sup> Thompson and Büchel traded emails during the first few days of February, with Büchel stating that he would \"not negotiate further this matter... because almost any of the main conditions are simply not fulfilled\" and Thompson writing that he believed the Museum had \"responded to [Büchel's] main issues.\"</p>\n<p>After that, direct communication between Büchel and the Museum became sparse. It was during this time, Büchel alleges, that the Museum developed a \"Plan B\"<sup>[18]</sup> to be implemented in the eventwhich was looking increasingly likelythat he did not return to finish the exhibit. Plan B, which involved publicly exhibiting the unfinished installation without the artist's permission, called for completing various elements of the installation in a way the Museum knew might differ from Büchel's artistic concept. Büchel cites an email chain on February 14 that included Joseph Thompson and Dante Birch, in which Thompson, stating that the Museum \"seem[ed] to be getting closer and closer to Plan B,\" gave specific instructions on various elements of the installation. Thompson suggested that Museum staff do \"[a]nything else Dante and Nato feel is known with 80% certainty.\"</p>\n<p>At least some Museum staff members recognized that continuing to work on the installation without Büchel's input might be problematic. Later in the February 14 email chain, Dante Birch noted that he was \"interested in protecting the museum from intellectual property issues.\" Pointing out that the show was advertised as a Büchel in the Museum's schedule, he stated that when reviewers came, \"the question will be `what is it?' ... and if it's reviewed as a Buchel we're in deep shit.\" Thompson's plans also raised concern among other MASS MoCA employees, including curator Susan Cross, who cautioned Thompson in a January 31 email that \"we tend to forget that whether we're doing the welding or not, there is an `author'an artist for whom we shouldn't make decisions.... At what point, if at all, does an artist lose his right to owning the idea and his/her `intellectual property?' ... I think it is still art and still belongs to Buchel.\"</p>\n<p>Both in his deposition and in his affidavit, Büchel described ways in which he felt the Museum had knowingly disregarded his specific instructions. For example, MASS MoCA's decision to build a cinderblock wall through the Cape Codstyle house in the installation, despite Büchel's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> expressed desire that the construction await his return, resulted in what Büchel considered a \"big distortion of the meaning of that element.\" The record is replete with similar allegations concerning other components of the installation, including the cinema, the bomb carousel, the Saddam spiderhole, the police car and the mobile home. Indeed, even the Museum, in its August 31, 2007 memorandum of law in support of its motion for summary judgment, admitted that the installation \"[m]aterials as they now stand <i>reflect significant aesthetic and design choices by MASS MoCA personnel,</i> including with respect to the layout of the [m]aterials, and with respect to the selection and procurement of pre-existing buildings and vehicles that have been modified and incorporated into the [m]aterials.\" (Emphasis added.)<sup>[19]</sup></p>\n<p>MASS MoCA argues that the evidence, taken in its entirety, does not add up to a triable issue with respect to a violation of Büchel's right of integrity, but shows only that Museum personnel were attempting to carry out Büchel's vision based on his instructions. Indeed, the Museum notes that the work slowed as Büchel's instructions became unavailable.<sup>[20]</sup> MASS MoCA specifically disputes Büchel's reading of the February 14 email chain as demonstrating the Museum's disregard of his creative rights over the installation, asserting that the discussion among its staff members in fact reflects a conscious effort to determine how far the Museum could appropriately go in light of the remaining instructions left by the artist. In one email, for example, Thompson noted that \"we are putting the correct objects in the spaces cb indicated. ... That's not `doing a buechel [sic]' that's prepping for buechel [sic] assuming, as we still are, that there is some chance we'll see him here again.\" Other communications in the record also could be interpreted as showing the Museum doing its best to carry out Büchel's concept for the art work.</p>\n<p>As we have noted, a jury may well accept the Museum's depiction of its intention and its actions. At this juncture, however, the record must be viewed in the light most favorable to Büchel. The evidence we have described would permit a jury to find that the Museum forged ahead with the installation in the first half of 2007 knowing that the continuing construction in Büchel's absence would frustrate and likely contradictBüchel's artistic vision. We thus conclude that a jury issue exists as to whether these actions effected <span class=\"star-pagination\">*60</span> an intentional distortion or other modification of \"Training Ground\" that subjected MASS MoCA to liability under VARA.</p>\n<p>The record also contains evidence from which a jury could conclude that the Museum's alterations had a detrimental impact on Büchel's honor or reputation. An article in the Boston Globe reported that, in February, Museum officials had shown the unfinished project to a group of Museum directors and curators who were attending an arts conference in the area. <i>See</i> Geoff Edgers, <i>Behind doors, a world unseen: Dispute cloaks massive installation at MASS MoCA,</i> Boston Globe (March 28, 2007), <i>available at</i> www.boston.com/ae/theater_arts/articles/2007/03/28/behind_doors_a_world_unseen/ (\"<i>Behind doors, a world unseen</i>\"). Another journalist reported on observing the unfinished (and still untarped) work. <i>See The Show Will Go On, supra.</i></p>\n<p>Although the commentary generated by these visits is not all negative,<sup>[21]</sup> there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that the changes to \"Training Ground\" caused prejudice to Büchel. The New York Times noted that the exhibition would \"certainly give people unfamiliar with his obsessive, history-driven aesthetic an inaccurate sense of his art, and this is indeed a form of damage.\" <i>Is It Art Yet?, supra.</i> A critic for the Boston Globe similarly observed that \"many people are going to judge [Büchel] and his work on the basis of this experience.\" Ken Johnson, <i>No admittance: MASS MoCA has mishandled disputed art installation,</i> Boston Globe, July 1, 2007, at 1N. One viewer, writing in <i>Commentary</i> magazine, observed that \"I am not sure that it suffers from being enveiled.\" Michael J. Lewis, <i>The Cost of Transgression,</i> http://www.commentarymagazine.com/blogs/index.php/lewis/499 (June 4, 2007). A review published in <i>Berkshire Fine Arts</i>subtitled \"Crap Under Wrap\"concluded that it would be a \"huge mistake\" to uncover the installation, which offered \"virtually nothing of substance or interest.\" <i>Crap Under Wrap, supra.</i></p>\n<p>The record thus shows that some viewers of the installation reacted unfavorably to the work in its allegedly modified and distorted form. A factfinder might conclude, of course, that it was Büchel's underlying concept (notwithstanding its unfinished state) rather than MASS MoCA's actions that elicited the negative reactions. However, a jury could also reasonably infer that the negative impressions resulted from the Museum's unauthorized modifications to \"Training Ground,\" diminishing the quality of the work and thereby harming Büchel's professional honor or reputation as a visual artist.</p>\n<p>In concluding that Büchel has adduced sufficient evidence to support a right-of-integrity claim, we reject the Museum's assertion that to find a violation of Büchel's right of integrity in these circumstances would make it impossible for parties to collaborate on large-scale artistic works. The Museum warns that, under Büchel's interpretation, \"no one other than the artist himself ... may <i>ever</i> perform any work in fabricating visual art unless that specific task has been authorized by the artist.\" We disagree. Although the artist's vision must govern, that principle does not prevent collaboration at the implementation level so long as the artist's vision guides that implementation. Here, Büchel alleges a campaign of intentional distortion and modification to his work in <span class=\"star-pagination\">*61</span> which Museum personnel repeatedly ignored his express wishes. Our holding that the summary judgment record precludes an affirmance of the district court on this claim may serve as a cautionary tale to museums contemplating similar installations in the futureguiding them to document the terms of their relationship and obtain VARA waivers where necessarybut it does not prevent museums or other collaborators from working cooperatively with artists on such non-traditional artworks.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Showing \"Training Ground\" Covered with Tarpaulins</h2>\n<p>Büchel also claims that MASS MoCA improperly modified and distorted \"Training Ground\" when it partially covered it with the yellow tarpaulins and displayed it in that condition. He asserts that the record shows beyond dispute that visitors looked behind the tarps, that the tarp-adorned installation was \"judged by others to be Büchel's work, and that his honor and reputation were harmed by it.\" In response, the Museum argues that the yellow tarpaulins were merely functionala way of keeping people \"out\" of the installationrather than an aesthetic modification of the artwork that gave MASS MoCA patrons a distorted view of it.</p>\n<p>Although the tarpaulins did prevent visitors to the Museum from seeing the entire unfinished installation, the record shows that a number of people were able to form an impression of \"Training Ground\" despite the partial covering. For example, according to one observer,</p>\n<blockquote>[the tarps] don't reach the floor, and they rise only about two feet above eye level, so they don't cover much. You can easily crouch down to slip your head underneath or peek through the slits between the vinyl sheets. Beyond the passageway formed by the tarps, the monumental elements of the installation rise all around you, plain as daythe cinderblock walls, the two-story house, the guard tower, the trailers, the carnival ride, all compacted together in a claustrophobic, politically surreal borough of hell, George Orwell by way of David Lynch.</blockquote>\n<p>Thomas Micchelli, <i>Christoph Büchel Training Ground for Democracy,</i> The Brooklyn Rail (September 2007), <i>available at</i> http://www.brooklynrail.org/2007/09/artseen/buchel. Another critic noted that the installation \"under all the tarps is really kind of a conceptual peep show. It doesn't take much effort or imagination to see most of the work.... Mass MoCA is hiding an elephant behind a napkin,\" and called it a \"wink, wink, wrap show.\" <i>Crap Under Wrap, supra.</i> Photographs in the record confirm that the covers did not obscure the general path and layout of the installation. Indeed, given the location of \"Training Ground,\" visitors to \"Made at MASS MoCA\" could not avoid seeing the unfinished \"Training Ground\" bedecked in tarpaulins.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, although the installation unquestionably looked different with the tarpaulins partially covering it, we agree with the district court that the mere covering of the artwork by the Museum, its host, cannot reasonably be deemed an intentional act of distortion or modification of Büchel's creation. To conclude otherwise would be to say that, even if all had gone well, the Museum would have been subject to a right-of-integrity claim if it had partially covered the work before its formal opening to prevent visitors from seeing it prematurely.</p>\n<p>This is not to say that MASS MoCA was necessarily acting with pure intentions when it created \"Made at MASS MoCA\" in close proximity to the tarped \"Training Ground.\" It might be a fair inference that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*62</span> the Museum was deliberately communicating its anger with Büchel by juxtaposing his unfinished work with the successful artistic collaborations depicted in its new exhibition. The partial covering of \"Training Ground\" may have been intended to highlight, rather than hide, the failed collaboration.<sup>[22]</sup> The right of integrity under VARA, however, protects the artist from distortions of his work, not from disparaging commentary about his behavior. In our view, a finding that the Museum's covering of the installation constituted an intentional act of distortion or modification of Büchel's artistic creation would stretch VARA beyond sensible boundaries.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Exhibiting \"Training Ground\" in Its Unfinished State</h2>\n<p>Büchel maintains that, even aside from the alleged modifications to \"Training Ground,\" merely exhibiting the work of art in its unfinished state, without the artist's consent, constitutes a distortion. We reject this claim. A separate moral right of disclosure (also known as the right of divulgation) protects an author's authority to \"prevent third parties from disclosing [his or her] work to the public without the author's consent,\" and is not covered by VARA. <i>See</i> Cyrill P. Rigamonti, <i>Deconstructing Moral Rights,</i> 47 Harv. Int'l L.J. 353, 373, 405 (2006) \"([T]he VARA ignores the rights of disclosure and withdrawal and instead focuses on the rights of attribution and integrity....\").</p>\n<p>Although Büchel proffered an expert who opined that showing an unfinished work without the artist's permission is inherently a distortion, we decline to interpret VARA to include such a claim where a separate moral right of disclosure is widely recognized in other jurisdictions and Congress explicitly limited the statute's coverage to the rights of attribution and integrity. <i>See</i> Amy M. Adler, <i>Against Moral Rights,</i> 97 Cal. L.Rev. 263, 268 (2009) (noting that most European countries \"recognize a right of divulgation, giving the artist the right to decide when (and whether) the work is complete and can be shown\"); Rigamonti, <i>supra,</i> at 356 (\"The standard set of moral rights recognized in the literature consists of the author's right to claim authorship (right of attribution), the right to object to modifications of the work (right of integrity), the right to decide when and how the work in question will be published (right of disclosure), and the right to withdraw a work after publication (right of withdrawal).\" (footnotes omitted)); 5 <i>Patry on Copyright</i> § 16:23 (noting that VARA does not give the artist \"a right to prohibit display of mutilated versions of his or her work, only the right to prohibit the mutilation itself\"). Any right Büchel possesses to withhold display of his artwork must be found outside VARA. We consider below his claim to such a right under section 106(5) of the Copyright Act. <i>See infra</i> Section IV.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>4. Summary of VARA Claims</h2>\n<p>After careful review of the record, we are persuaded that a reasonable jury could find that Büchel is entitled to relief under VARA based on the Museum's continuing work on \"Training Ground\" over his objections. Genuine disputes of material fact foreclose summary judgment for either Büchel or MASS MoCA on that claim. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*63</span> We find no merit, however, in Büchel's claim that MASS MoCA intentionally modified or distorted \"Training Ground\" by covering it with tarpaulins, and we reject as outside the scope of the statute Büchel's claim that the Museum violated VARA by displaying the installation over his objections. We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment for the Museum on Büchel's right-of-attribution claim, which became moot when MASS MoCA dismantled the installation in 2007.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>IV.</h2>\n<p>We now assess Büchel's challenge to the grant of summary judgment for MASS MoCA on his Copyright Act claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Public Display</h2>\n<p>The owner of a copyrighted work has the exclusive right to \"display the copyrighted work publicly.\" 17 U.S.C. § 106(5). Displaying a work is defined as \"show[ing] a copy of it, either directly or by means of a film, slide, television image, or any other device or process.\" 17 U.S.C. § 101. A \"copy\" includes the original. <i>Id.</i> Büchel argued below, as he does on appeal, that the Museum's repeated public exhibitions of \"Training Ground for Democracy\" constituted a public display of his work in violation of his exclusive right under section 106(5). The district court gave no explicit reason for its dismissal of this claim, remarking only that \"[f]or the reasons already stated,\" presumably in its discussion of VARA, MASS MoCA was \"entitled to judgment on this count.\" 565 F.Supp.2d at 261.</p>\n<p>The court also remarked, however, that since Büchel \"would have suffered a violation of no right recognized by this statute, this messy situation simply fell outside the boundary of VARA and, a fortiori, outside the more general provisions of the Copyright Act.\" <i>Id.</i> at 260. This statement reflects a misreading of the Copyright Act. As we have explained, the moral rights granted to specific artists under VARA are separate and independent from the economic rights guaranteed by section 106. 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a) (providing that rights of attribution and integrity are \"independent of the exclusive rights provided in section 106\"). Thus, the inadequacy of claims under VARA does not, on its own, signify the inadequacy of more traditional copyright claims. <i>See</i> Wu, <i>supra,</i> at 164 (observing that VARA has \"acquired the attributes of a false talisman,\" both because artists overly rely on it in \"instances where economic rights, including traditional rights of copyright provided by Section 106 ... would more effectively protect their interests\" and also because courts tend to view VARA claims as \"devalu[ing] entitlements to economic rights pleaded in tandem with VARA claims\").</p>\n<p>We thus turn specifically to this claim. The Museum argues that Büchel has failed to present a triable issue of fact on his claim under section 106(5) because the unfinished work was never publicly displayed. However, as we have described in the context of our VARA discussion, there is significant record evidence suggesting that the work was repeatedly and deliberately exhibited to numerous individuals.<sup>[23]</sup></p>\n<p>MASS MoCA also asserts an affirmative defense under section 109(c), which provides that \"the owner of a particular copy lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright <span class=\"star-pagination\">*64</span> owner, to display that copy publicly.\" 17 U.S.C. § 109(c). The Museum argues that it owned the physical copy of \"Training Ground,\" and that section 109(c) therefore permitted it to display the unfinished work. Here again, however, the record reveals disputed issues of fact with respect to whether the Museum's copy was \"lawfully made,\" as it may have been created in violation of the artist's rights under VARA. Moreover, Büchel introduced evidence to rebut the Museum's assertion that \"the installation's various components\" all belonged to, or were purchased by, MASS MoCA. Finally, Büchel presented evidence that the Museum understood that the physical copy of the installation belonged to him.<sup>[24]</sup> Accordingly, viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Büchel, we cannot say that a reasonable jury could not conclude that the Museum violated his exclusive right to publicly display \"Training Ground for Democracy.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Derivative Works</h2>\n<p>The Copyright Act also grants artists the exclusive right to \"prepare derivative works based upon the copyrighted work.\" 17 U.S.C. § 106(2). A derivative work is defined as one \"based upon one or more preexisting works,\" such as a translation, musical arrangement, fictionalization, \"or any other form in which a work may be recast, transformed, or adapted.\" 17 U.S.C. § 101. A derivative work includes any work \"consisting of editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications which, as a whole, represent an original work of authorship.\" <i>Id.</i> Büchel brought two claims based on this provision, asserting that MASS MoCA created unauthorized derivative works based on the installation itself and on the work's models and plans.</p>\n<p>The district court ruled that, \"[e]ven assuming that the stumbling, and eventually abandoned, process of collaboration during 2006 produced an original work of art subject to copyright protection, which is highly doubtful, clearly no `derivative' work of art was created by MASS MoCA's attempt (however flawed) to play its part in this process.\" 565 F.Supp.2d at 261. It further rejected Büchel's argument that, by placing tarpaulins over the unfinished installation, the Museum created a separate, unauthorized derivative work. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>On appeal, Büchel summarily argues that what the Museum displayed in Building 5, both with and without the yellow tarpaulins, \"recast\" or \"transformed\" the work that he had originally set out in his plans and left behind in December 2006, thus creating derivative works under the Copyright Act.<sup>[25]</sup> In response, MASS MoCA again argues that its staff was following Büchel's instructions when working on \"Training Ground\" in his absence, and that the Museum therefore was merely executing Büchel's vision rather than exercising its own artistic judgment to create a new, derivative artwork.</p>\n<p>A derivative work within the meaning of the Copyright Act \"consists of a contribution <span class=\"star-pagination\">*65</span> of original material to a pre-existing work so as to recast, transform or adapt the pre-existing work,\" and the variation from the original must be \"sufficient to render the derivative work distinguishable from its prior work in any meaningful manner.\" Nimmer, <i>supra,</i> § 3.03[A]; <i>see also </i><i>Schrock v. Learning Curve Int'l, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1381877\"><a href=\"/opinion/1381877/schrock-v-learning-curve-intern-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">586</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">513</span></a></span>, 520-21 (7th Cir.2009); <i>Woods v. Bourne Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"700442\"><a href=\"/opinion/700442/david-d-woods-florence-l-woods-kristine-woods-and-benjamin-woods-dba/\"><span class=\"volume\">60</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">978</span></a></span>, 990 (2d Cir.1995). As we have held, Büchel's contention that his work was modified without his permission and to his detriment gives rise to a right-of-integrity claim under VARA. Every modification of a work of art does not, however, result in the creation of a derivative work.</p>\n<p>In Büchel's 52-page opening brief, there is one paragraph that purports to analyze the derivative work claim, and that paragraph itself is largely descriptive rather than analytical. Büchel cites no cases and does not explain how the modified \"Training Ground\" was sufficiently original and distinctive within the meaning of the Copyright Act to qualify as a derivative work. His reply brief adds another paragraph, citing cases, but he again asserts in summary fashion that the modifications resulted in a derivative work. He states that the degree of creativity needed for a derivative work is minimal, but does not explain how the Museum's alterations create a new work that, as a whole, meets the Copyright Act's originality requirement. The law applicable to derivative work claims, particularly as it intersects with VARA's protection for works of visual art, is complex. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Lee v. A.R.T. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746478\"><a href=\"/opinion/746478/annie-lee-and-annie-lee-friends-company-inc-v-art-company-also/\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">580</span></a></span>, 582-83 (7th Cir.1997); Henry Hansmann, <i>Authors' and Artists' Moral Rights: A Comparative Legal and Economic Analysis,</i> 26 J. Legal Stud. 95, 114-116 (1997). Büchel's undeveloped argument is so perfunctory that we deem the claim waived. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990) (stating that, on appeal, \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>V.</h2>\n<p>We summarize our holdings:</p>\n<p>1. VARA's protection of an artist's moral rights extends to unfinished creations that are \"works of art\" within the meaning of the Copyright Act;</p>\n<p>2. The right of integrity under VARA protects artists from distortions, mutilations or modifications of their works that are prejudicial to their reputation or honor, and prejudice must be shown for both injunctive relief and damages;</p>\n<p>3. Büchel has adduced sufficient evidence to raise a genuine issue of material fact as to whether MASS MoCA violated his right of integrity on one of his three asserted bases for liability, namely, by modifying \"Training Ground\" over his objections in a manner that harmed his honor or reputation. His right-of-integrity claims based on the yellow tarpaulins and the mere display of \"Training Ground\" lack merit;</p>\n<p>4. Büchel's right-of-attribution claim is moot, as VARA provides only injunctive relief to protect the right of attribution and the installation no longer exists;</p>\n<p>5. The record reveals a genuine issue of material fact as to whether MASS MoCA violated Büchel's exclusive right under section 106(5) of the Copyright Act to display his work publicly;</p>\n<p>6. Büchel fails to adequately develop his claim that MASS MoCA violated his exclusive right under section 106(2) to prepare derivative works based on \"Training Ground,\" and that claim is therefore waived.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*66</span> We thus remand the case for further proceedings on Büchel's remaining right-of-integrity claim under VARA and his public display claim under section 106 of the Copyright Act.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed in part, vacated in part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this decision. Each party is to bear its own costs.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  VARA was enacted as an amendment to the Copyright Act. <i>See infra</i> Section II.</p>\n<p>[2]  We consider the parties' conflicting accounts of the key evidence in our summary judgment analysis, <i>infra.</i></p>\n<p>[3]  Throughout the opinion, any reference to \"Thompson\" without a first name will refer to Museum Director Joseph Thompson. Nato Thompson will be identified by his full name.</p>\n<p>[4]  The letter, signed by Museum Director Joseph Thompson, was attached to an email sent by Nato Thompson. The proposal did not lay out a definitive budget for the project, although in a separate letter to Büchel the following day, Joseph Thompson stated \"we think we've got a $160,000 project on our hands in direct costs.\" In a reply email dated September 24, 2006, Büchel did not explicitly agree to or reject the $160,000 figure, but suggested that MASS MoCA get in touch with his two galleries, which might provide information regarding \"potential sponsors like foundations\" for the installation.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Berne convention, developed at the instigation of Victor Hugo and first adopted in Berne, Switzerland in 1886, is \"`an international copyright treaty providing that works created by citizens of one signatory nation will be fully protected in other signatory nations, without the need for local formalities.'\" <i>Phillips,</i> 459 F.3d at 133 n. 3 (quoting <i>Black's Law Dictionary,</i> 8th ed. (1999)).</p>\n<p>[6]  Under the Copyright Act, a plaintiff may elect to recover statutory damages instead of actual damages for each work infringed \"in a sum of not less than $750 or more than $30,000 as the court considers just.\" 17 U.S.C. § 504(c)(1). If the copyright owner proves that the infringement was committed willfully, the court \"in its discretion\" may increase the award of statutory damages to \"a sum of not more than $150,000.\" <i>Id.</i> at 504(c)(2). The award may also be reduced to $200 if the infringer proves that he or she was not aware \"and had no reason to believe that his or her acts constituted an infringement of copyright.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[7]  The parties do not dispute that, if completed, \"Training Ground for Democracy\" would have been a sculpture and therefore a qualified \"work of visual art\" under VARA. Furthermore, VARA's legislative history states that \"[t]he term `sculpture' includes, but is not limited to, castings, carvings, modelings, and <i>constructions.\"</i> House Report at 11 (1990), <i>as reprinted in</i> 1990 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 6921 (emphasis added). The Second Circuit in <i>Carter</i> similarly considered VARA's application to a \"very large `walk-through sculpture' occupying most, but not all, of [a] building's lobby.\" 71 F.3d at 80; <i>see also id.</i> at 84 (\"Concededly, considered as a whole, the work is a sculpture and exists only in a single copy.\").</p>\n<p>[8]  Section 501(a) states, in relevant part, that \"[a]nyone who violates any of the exclusive rights of the copyright owner ... or of the author as provided in section 106A(a) [VARA]... is an infringer of the copyright or right of the author, as the case may be.\" The provision further states that, with the exception of the criminal penalties provided under section 506, \"any reference to copyright shall be deemed to include the rights conferred by section 106A(a).\"</p>\n<p>[9]  As provided in 17 U.S.C. § 106A(c)(3), VARA specifically excludes certain categories of artwork listed in section 101 of the Copyright Act:\n</p>\n<p>(A) (i) any poster, map, globe, chart, technical drawing, diagram, model, applied art, motion picture or other audiovisual work, book, magazine, newspaper, periodical, data base, electronic information service, electronic publication, or similar publication;</p>\n<p>(ii) any merchandising item or advertising, promotional, descriptive, covering, or packaging material or container;</p>\n<p>(iii) any portion or part of any item described in clause (i) or (ii);</p>\n<p>(B) any work made for hire</p>\n<p>17 U.S.C. § 101.</p>\n<p>[10]  Nothing in the language of VARA or the definitions provision of the Copyright Act permits distinct treatment for the rights of copyright owners whose works are complete and those whose works are still in progress. We therefore reject the \"special clarity\" standard articulated by the district court for proving a violation of an artist's VARA rights in an unfinished work of art.</p>\n<p>[11]  The Second Circuit ultimately found that the sculpture was exempted from VARA protections because it was a \"work for hire.\" <i>See</i> 71 F.3d at 86-88.</p>\n<p>[12]  Our decision in <i>Phillips</i> is not inconsistent with this holding. In <i>Phillips,</i> we held that VARA did not apply to site-specific works of art, in which the particular location of the artwork is one of its physical elements and removal of the artwork destroys it. 459 F.3d at 140. We observed that VARA does not explicitly address protection for site-specific works despite the impact of such works on real property interests, <i>id.</i> at 142, and we declined to interpret VARA in a way that was neither supported by the statutory language nor sensible as policy. <i>See id.</i> at 142-43. Here, the plain language controls, and there is no conflict with \"`long-established and familiar principles'\" of the common law. <i>Id.</i> at 142 (quoting <i>United States v. Texas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112841\"><a href=\"/opinion/112841/united-states-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">529</span></a></span>, 534, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112841\"><a href=\"/opinion/112841/united-states-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1631</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112841\"><a href=\"/opinion/112841/united-states-v-texas/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></a></span> (1993)).</p>\n<p>[13]  In some jurisdictions, the right of integrity also generally protects artwork from destruction. <i>See </i><i>Carter,</i> 71 F.3d at 81. In the United States, however, VARA protects only works of \"recognized stature\" from destruction. 17 U.S.C. § 106A(a)(3)(B). That right is not implicated in this case.</p>\n<p>[14]  Article 6<i>bis</i> of the Berne Convention, which is titled \"Moral Rights,\" includes a heading that lists among those rights \"to object to certain modifications and other derogatory actions.\" The provision itself states, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>(1) Independently of the author's economic rights, and even after the transfer of the said rights, the author shall have the right... to object to any distortion, mutilation or other modification of, or other derogatory action in relation to, the said work, which would be prejudicial to his honor or reputation.</p>\n<p>Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works art. 6<i>bis,</i> Sept. 9, 1986, S. Treaty Doc. No. 99-27, 1161 U.N.T.S. 30.</p>\n<p>[15]  Based on revisions to the statutory language made during the legislative process, Patry concludes that \"where an intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification has already occurred, the plaintiff need not prove harm to his or her honor or reputation.\" 5 Patry, <i>supra,</i> § 16:22. He further states, without supporting citation, that \"[i]t was understood informally\" that the final version of the provision was designed \"to permit a cause of action ... without the need for proof that the artist's honor or reputation was harmed.\" <i>Id.</i> To the extent Patry's conclusion is that no evidence of harm is necessary, we reject it as inconsistent with the available legislative history, as discussed above. It may be, however, that Congress's concern was only that a plaintiff not be required to prove the actual amount of damage to reputation, but could opt for the statutory damages remedy upon showing prejudice. <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. §§ 501(a), 504(c) (stating that a VARA plaintiff may elect to recover statutory damages instead of actual damages and profits).</p>\n<p>[16]  Section 106A(a)(3) states that the author of a work of visual art shall have the right \"(A) to prevent any intentional distortion, mutilation, or other modification of that work which would be prejudicial to his or her honor or reputation\" and the right \"(B) to prevent any destruction of a work of recognized stature.\"</p>\n<p>[17]  \"I wrote very clearly immediately to [Dante Birch, the Museum's production manager] not to use the method we talked about and stop it ..., as well cinder block walls have to be partly redone that have been built without my instruction....\"</p>\n<p>[18]  The term \"Plan B\" appears in the record in a February 14, 2007 email from Thompson to other Museum staff.</p>\n<p>[19]  This assertion by MASS MoCA was made to support its contention, rejected by the district court and halfheartedly renewed on appeal, that the unfinished installation might constitute a joint work of Büchel and the Museum. A claim of joint authorship requires proof that the parties \"entertain in their minds the concept of joint ownership.\" <i>Thomson v. Larson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755387\"><a href=\"/opinion/755387/lynn-m-thomson-v-allan-s-larson-nanette-larson-and-julie-larson/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">195</span></a></span>, 201 (2d Cir.1998) (quotation marks and citation omitted). Here, multiple facts indicate that the parties' understanding from the outset was that \"Training Ground\" was solely a Christoph Büchel work of art. The Museum's December 6, 2006 postponement announcement described the work as \"Christoph Büchel's vast installation\" and, as reflected in the emails described above, Museum personnel internally recognized Büchel as the artist, at least as \"Training Ground\" was originally conceived. It is also undisputed that, at the outset of their relationship, the parties had agreed that Büchel alone would hold the copyright in the finished work. These facts negate any claim of joint authorship.</p>\n<p>[20]  In his deposition, Thompson testified as follows:\n</p>\n<p>[T]here was a whole long list of things for which we had adequate direction and understanding that we could continue forward to a certain point. When the work began to get very detailed and would require input from Christoph, if we could get the input from him, we would continue, and if we didn't, we would stop.</p>\n<p>[21]  Thompson told an outside consultant for the Museum in March 2007 that a curator at the New Museum in New York had just viewed the installation \"and said it was one of the best works he's seen in the past three years.\"</p>\n<p>[22]  Indeed, the Boston Globe's art critic, Ken Johnson, described the exhibit as a \"self-serving photo and text display\" that implicitly conveys criticism of Büchel for the failure of \"Training Ground for Democracy.\" <i>See MASS MoCA has Mishandled Disputed Art Installation, supra.</i> The juxtaposition left Johnson with the impression that MASS MoCA was \"exacting revenge\" against the artist \"by turning his project into a show that misrepresents, dishonors, vilifies, and even ridicules him.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>[23]  In addition to the journalists and Museum personnel noted earlier, a newspaper reported that the mayor of North Adams had seen the exhibit twice, once with Governor Deval Patrick. <i>See Behind doors, a world unseen, supra.</i></p>\n<p>[24]  For example, in an email sent on September 11, 2006 to curator Nato Thompson, the Museum's director (Joseph Thompson) said: \"I assume you've already laid out the general idea [to Büchel] (we build it, and it belongs to you),\" and also noted that Büchel had the right to \"sell all or part of it.\" The Museum's proposed contract, which was never signed, would have conferred ownership on Büchel. It stated that, \"[u]pon termination of the exhibition, the fabricated work shall be owned outright by you, including all copyrights and related preparatory materials.\"</p>\n<p>[25]  Our analysis of the right-of-integrity tarpaulin claim disposes as well of Büchel's contention that covering the installation constituted a modification of the original work that resulted in the creation of a derivative work.</p>\n\n</div>",
