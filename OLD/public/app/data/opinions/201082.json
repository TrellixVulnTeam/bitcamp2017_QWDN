Petitioner Besnik Kurshumi appeals from a\n\ndecision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\" or \"Board\")\n\naffirming the Immigration Judge's (\"IJ\") denial of his application\n\nfor asylum and withholding of removal.   In a written opinion, the\n\nBIA concluded that Kurshumi had failed to establish either past\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.   Having\n\ncarefully reviewed the record and the petition for review, we\n\naffirm.\n\n                                I.\n\n          Kurshumi, a native and citizen of Albania, entered the\n\nUnited States illegally on or about July 13, 1994.     Deportation\n\nproceedings were initiated when the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService (\"INS\")1 served Kurshumi with an order to show cause\n\ncharging deportability under former section 241(a)(1)(B) of the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act, 8 U.S.C. § 1251(a)(1)(B) (1998),\n\nfor entering the country without inspection.     Kurshumi conceded\n\ndeportability but applied for asylum and withholding of removal.\n\n          Kurshumi asserted in his application that he could not\n\nreturn to Albania because, inter alia, he and his wife had been\n\nsubjected to \"constant and intense surveillance\" (including mail\n\n\n\n     1\n      On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist as an agency within\nthe Department of Justice.        Its enforcement functions were\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security. See Homeland\nSecurity Act of 2002, Pub.L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002).\nBecause the events at issue here predate that reorganization, we\nrefer to the INS in this opinion.\n\n                               -2-\n\fscreening), allegedly on account of their actions (and the actions\n\nof his wife's family) in speaking out against both the former\n\nCommunist regime in Albania and the current Albanian government.\n\nKurshumi also claimed that members of his wife's family had been\n\nsubjected to various forms of mistreatment by the then in-power\n\nCommunist government.2 In an addendum to his application, Kurshumi\n\nalleged that, because he was not a member of the Communist party in\n\nAlbania when that party was in power, he was prohibited from\n\npursuing a career as an airplane pilot; instead, he was sent to\n\nwork for a government-run high school as a physical-education\n\ninstructor and was later fired \"since he had not been a member of\n\nthe Communist party.\"\n\n          At a hearing before the IJ, in addition to testifying\n\nabout the events described in his application, Kurshumi testified,\n\nin pertinent part, as follows: that, until the early 1990s, he\n\nlived unharmed as a physical-education instructor; that, in 1991,\n\nhe (along with 10,000 other demonstrators) participated in a\n\npolitical demonstration against the former Communist government;\n\n\n\n     2\n      In particular, Kurshumi stated, inter alia, that his wife's\ngrandfather had been sentenced to death in the 1940s due to his\nanti-Communist views but that this sentence eventually was commuted\nto fifteen years imprisonment; that his wife's father had been\nsentenced to \"hard labor in construction\" sometime in the 1970s or\n80s; that his wife's uncle had been sentenced to nine-years\nimprisonment after criticizing Communist ideals; and that his\nwife's entire family had been subjected to random interrogations,\nbeatings, and mental abuse during the Communist era (which since\nhas ended).\n\n                               -3-\n\fthat he also spoke out against the new government by writing a\n\nletter to parliament; that, in response to this letter, he was\n\ninvited to discuss his concerns with the Vice President of the\n\nDefense Commission and two deputies; that, in fact, he did meet\n\nwith these individuals; that, after this meeting, he was invited to\n\na second meeting (this time with parliament); that, on the day of\n\nthe second meeting, he was brought to the defense minister and was\n\nasked who    would   attend   the   meeting;    that   he   criticized   this\n\nminister for over an hour; that another meeting was set up between\n\nhimself and the president of parliament; that, prior to this\n\nmeeting, he received a note informing him that he was being\n\ntransferred from the government-run high school to a new job as\n\ncommander of a military team (and, on cross-examination, that the\n\ngovernment-run high school from which he had been transferred had\n\nclosed down just three months after his transfer); that, because of\n\nhealth problems, he did not timely report to his new job; that,\n\nupon eventually reporting to the job, he was fired for having\n\nfailed to report; that, around the same time, Albanian police\n\nofficers secured a warrant to search –- and did search –- his home\n\n(and the homes of approximately twenty-five others); and that he\n\nthereafter wrote a letter to the newspaper, which was published and\n\nwhich criticized the search of his home.\n\n            In addition to the above testimony, Kurshumi's wife\n\ncorroborated   her   husband's      testimony   and    provided   additional\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\finformation about the events relating to her family that were\n\ndescribed in Kurshumi's application.          She also testified that, on\n\nthe advice of her father, she never spoke out publicly against the\n\nCommunist government and that she never participated politically\n\nuntil the demonstration in 1991; that she herself had no problems\n\nwith the Albanian government following the search of the house in\n\n1992; and that she had at least two sisters living peacefully in\n\nAlbania.    Finally, there was testimony of a general nature from an\n\nexpert on European history and totalitarian governments.\n\n            In   an    oral    decision,     the    IJ   denied    Kurshumi's\n\napplications for asylum and withholding of removal.                    Kurshumi\n\nsought review from the BIA, which subsequently issued a two-page\n\nper curiam opinion affirming the IJ's decision.                   This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            We are presented with three arguments on appeal: (1) \"the\n\nBoard erred when it failed to provide a clear administrative\n\nfinding\"; (2) \"the Board erred when it found that [Kurshumi] had\n\nnot established a well-founded fear of [future] persecution and\n\n[when it found] that he had [not] suffered past persecution\"; and\n\n(3) \"the    Board     erred   in   failing   to   consider   current    country\n\nconditions in light of [Kurshumi's] past persecution.\"                 None are\n\nconvincing.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f             First,    contrary    to    Kurshumi's     assertion,        the    BIA\n\narticulated a clear rationale for its decision to affirm.                        The\n\norder states that \"[the BIA] agree[s] with the Immigration Judge's\n\ndecision that [Kurshumi] failed to establish past persecution or a\n\nwell-founded fear or clear probability of persecution in Albania\n\nbased on one of the five protected statutory grounds . . .,\n\nespecially in light of changed country conditions.\" In addition to\n\nadopting expressly the reasoning of the IJ (\"[T]he [IJ's] decision\n\nwill be affirmed for the reasons stated therein . . . .\"), the BIA\n\naddressed Kurshumi's principal concerns as follows: (1) \"[t]o the\n\nextent   that   [certain      factual]    findings     [of    the   IJ]    may    be\n\nerroneous, we find them to be harmless, inasmuch as we find the\n\n[IJ's] legal conclusion is correct . . . [because,] even if the\n\ngovernment transferred [Kurshumi] because of his political opinion,\n\nsuch   act   does     not   rise   to   the   level   of     persecution\";       (2)\n\n\"[Kurshumi] has provided no convincing argument that he has ever\n\nsuffered persecution in the past or would likely suffer persecution\n\nin the future because of his relationship to his wife's family.\"\n\nThe BIA is not required to discuss each and every piece of evidence\n\nor write an exegesis on every contention.             See Morales v. INS, 208\n\nF.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n             Second, we agree with the BIA that Kurshumi has failed to\n\nmeet his burden of proving eligibility for asylum and a fortiori\n\nhas failed to meet his burden relating to withholding of removal.\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fSee Mabikas v. INS, 358 F.3d 145, 149 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"The\n\napplicant bears the burden of establishing eligibility for asylum\n\nby proving either past persecution or a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution. The law requires an asylum seeker to demonstrate that\n\nhe   is   a   refugee     .    .    .    by     adducing   evidence    that       such    past\n\npersecution or fear of future persecution is due to one of . . .\n\nfive grounds . . ., namely, race, religion, nationality, membership\n\nin a particular social group, or political opinion.\" (citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted)); Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 372 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (\"Because the . . . standard for withholding deportation\n\nis more stringent than that for asylum, a petitioner unable to\n\nsatisfy the asylum standard fails, a fortiori, to satisfy the\n\nformer.\" (citation omitted)).                   \"[W]e review a denial of a petition\n\nfor asylum by the BIA under a substantial evidence standard.                                We\n\nwill not reverse the BIA's decision unless the record evidence\n\nwould     compel    a     reasonable            factfinder    to    make      a        contrary\n\ndetermination.\"         Yatskin v. INS, 255 F.3d 5, 9 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(citation and quotation marks omitted).\n\n              The   BIA       had       ample    evidence    from     which       to    reject\n\nKurshumi's asylum claim, and we certainly are not \"compelled\" to\n\nconclude that Kurshumi was persecuted in the past or has a well-\n\nfounded fear of being persecuted in the future on account of his\n\npolitical opinions or membership in any particular social group.\n\nAlthough Kurshumi was transferred from his job as a physical-\n\n\n\n                                                -7-\n\feducation instructor to a new post from which he subsequently was\n\nfired, both events easily are explained by other-than-protected\n\ncircumstances (i.e., the school closure and a failure to report,\n\nrespectively).   Even assuming a nexus between these events and one\n\nof the five protected grounds -- an inference that might well be\n\ndebated -- such events normally do not rise to the level at which\n\na reasonable factfinder would be compelled to find past persecution\n\nand do not do so here.   See, e.g., Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 264\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (concluding that a reasonable factfinder would not\n\nhave been compelled to find past persecution where petitioner was\n\nsubjected to \"three episodes of solitary confinement of less than\n\n72 hours, each accompanied by abuse . . . [as well as] regular\n\nharassment in the form of periodic surveillance, threatening phone\n\ncalls, occasional stops and searches, and visits to her place of\n\nwork\").   We therefore conclude that there was substantial evidence\n\nfor the BIA to find that Kurshumi \"has not demonstrated that he\n\nsuffered past persecution or [that he] has a well-founded fear of\n\n[future] persecution.\"\n\n           Finally, Kurshumi contends that the BIA erred when it\n\nfailed to consider evidence that \"little has changed in Albania\n\nfollowing the collapse of the Communist regime.\" Kurshumi premises\n\nthis argument on the assertion that he established past persecution\n\nand thus was entitled to a rebuttable presumption regarding a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution.    See Fergiste v. INS, 138 F.3d\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f14, 18 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"A finding of past persecution triggers a\n\nregulatory presumption that the applicant has a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution, provisionally establishing the applicant's\n\nrefugee status and eligibility for asylum.   Where the Board finds\n\nthat past persecution has been established, the INS has the burden\n\nof proving . . . that since the time the persecution occurred\n\nconditions in the applicant's country of nationality have changed\n\nto such an extent that the applicant no longer has a well-founded\n\nfear of being persecuted if he were to return.\" (citations and\n\nquotation marks omitted)).   As Kurshumi has failed to establish\n\npast persecution, see supra, we need not entertain this argument.\n\n          Affirmed.3\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      We note that our disposition of this appeal does not in any\nway affect Kurshumi's derivative-asylee status, which (on March 30,\n2004) was granted to him by reason of his wife's asylee status.\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3) (\"A spouse . . . of an alien who is\ngranted asylum [under subsection (b)] may, if not otherwise\neligible for asylum under this section, be granted the same status\nas the alien . . . .\").      Kurshumi's asylee status, of course,\nremains dependent upon his wife's asylee status.         See id. §\n1158(c)(2) (\"Asylum granted under subsection (b) of this section\ndoes not convey a right to remain permanently in the United States,\nand may be terminated . . . [for one of several reasons].\"); see\nalso 8 C.F.R. § 208.24(d) (\"Termination of derivative status. The\ntermination of asylum status for a person who was the principal\napplicant shall result in termination of the asylum status of a\nspouse or child whose status was based on the asylum application of\nthe principal.\").\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n                                      II.\n\n            We are presented with three arguments on appeal: (1) \"the\n\nBoard erred when it failed to provide a clear administrative\n\nfinding\"; (2) \"the Board erred when it found that [Kurshumi] had\n\nnot established a well-founded fear of [future] persecution and\n\n[when it found] that he had [not] suffered past persecution\"; and\n\n(3) \"the    Board     erred   in   failing   to   consider   current    country\n\nconditions in light of [Kurshumi's] past persecution.\"                 None are\n\nconvincing.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\f             First,    contrary    to    Kurshumi's     assertion,        the    BIA\n\narticulated a clear rationale for its decision to affirm.                        The\n\norder states that \"[the BIA] agree[s] with the Immigration Judge's\n\ndecision that [Kurshumi] failed to establish past persecution or a\n\nwell-founded fear or clear probability of persecution in Albania\n\nbased on one of the five protected statutory grounds . . .,\n\nespecially in light of changed country conditions.\" In addition to\n\nadopting expressly the reasoning of the IJ (\"[T]he [IJ's] decision\n\nwill be affirmed for the reasons stated therein . . . .\"), the BIA\n\naddressed Kurshumi's principal concerns as follows: (1) \"[t]o the\n\nextent   that   [certain      factual]    findings     [of    the   IJ]    may    be\n\nerroneous, we find them to be harmless, inasmuch as we find the\n\n[IJ's] legal conclusion is correct . . . [because,] even if the\n\ngovernment transferred [Kurshumi] because of his political opinion,\n\nsuch   act   does     not   rise   to   the   level   of     persecution\";       (2)\n\n\"[Kurshumi] has provided no convincing argument that he has ever\n\nsuffered persecution in the past or would likely suffer persecution\n\nin the future because of his relationship to his wife's family.\"\n\nThe BIA is not required to discuss each and every piece of evidence\n\nor write an exegesis on every contention.

Even assuming a nexus between these events and one\n\nof the five protected grounds -- an inference that might well be\n\ndebated -- such events normally do not rise to the level at which\n\na reasonable factfinder would be compelled to find past persecution\n\nand do not do so here.   See, e.g., Nelson v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 264\n\n(1st Cir. 2000) (concluding that a reasonable factfinder would not\n\nhave been compelled to find past persecution where petitioner was\n\nsubjected to \"three episodes of solitary confinement of less than\n\n72 hours, each accompanied by abuse . . . [as well as] regular\n\nharassment in the form of periodic surveillance, threatening phone\n\ncalls, occasional stops and searches, and visits to her place of\n\nwork\").   We therefore conclude that there was substantial evidence\n\nfor the BIA to find that Kurshumi \"has not demonstrated that he\n\nsuffered past persecution or [that he] has a well-founded fear of\n\n[future] persecution.\"\n\n           Finally, Kurshumi contends that the BIA erred when it\n\nfailed to consider evidence that \"little has changed in Albania\n\nfollowing the collapse of the Communist regime.\" Kurshumi premises\n\nthis argument on the assertion that he established past persecution\n\nand thus was entitled to a rebuttable presumption regarding a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution.    See Fergiste v. INS, 138 F.3d\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\f14, 18 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"A finding of past persecution triggers a\n\nregulatory presumption that the applicant has a well-founded fear\n\nof future persecution, provisionally establishing the applicant's\n\nrefugee status and eligibility for asylum.

As Kurshumi has failed to establish\n\npast persecution, see supra, we need not entertain this argument.\n\n          Affirmed.3\n\n\n\n\n     3\n      We note that our disposition of this appeal does not in any\nway affect Kurshumi's derivative-asylee status, which (on March 30,\n2004) was granted to him by reason of his wife's asylee status.\nSee 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(3) (\"A spouse . . . of an alien who is\ngranted asylum [under subsection (b)] may, if not otherwise\neligible for asylum under this section, be granted the same status\nas the alien . . . .\").      Kurshumi's asylee status, of course,\nremains dependent upon his wife's asylee status.         See id. §\n1158(c)(2) (\"Asylum granted under subsection (b) of this section\ndoes not convey a right to remain permanently in the United States,\nand may be terminated . . .
