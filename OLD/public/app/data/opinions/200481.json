Invoking 28 U.S.C. § 2255 (2000),\n\npetitioner-appellant George Sepulveda, a federal prisoner, mounted\n\na collateral attack on his conviction and sentence for witness\n\nintimidation.      The    district    court   repulsed   the    attack.    The\n\npetitioner's    ensuing    appeal     presents   two   questions    of    first\n\nimpression within this circuit.         The first asks whether the rule\n\nannounced in Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000), applies\n\nretroactively to cases on collateral review.           The second, relevant\n\nonly   if   Apprendi   lacks   such    retroactivity,    asks    whether   the\n\nenactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\n\n(AEDPA), Pub. L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), rendered the\n\ndoctrine of Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989), inapplicable to\n\ninitial petitions for post-conviction relief under section 2255.\n\nConcluding, as we do, that Apprendi has no retroactive effect and\n\nthat Teague is not a dead letter in the AEDPA context, we affirm\n\nthe denial of the petitioner's habeas corpus application.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            The petitioner, known in some circles as \"King Paradise,\"\n\nwas convicted of multiple crimes arising out of his activities as\n\nthe leader of the Providence chapter of the Almighty Latin King\n\nNation.     We affirmed those convictions in United States v. Lara,\n\n181 F.3d 183 (1st Cir. 1999).               Here, we reconstruct only the\n\nfactual terrain pertinent to the issues before us, referring those\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\fwho seek a more detailed topographic model to our earlier opinion.\n\nSee id. at 190-91.\n\n          A grand jury empaneled in the District of Rhode Island\n\nreturned a thirteen-count indictment against the petitioner and\n\nseveral others.   After a lengthy trial, a petit jury convicted the\n\npetitioner of racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering,\n\nmurder in aid of racketeering, witness intimidation, and possessing\n\na firearm as a convicted felon.   See 18 U.S.C. §§ 1962(c), 1962(d),\n\n1959(a), 1512(b)(3), 922(g)(1).    The district court imposed three\n\nconcurrent life sentences, a concurrent twenty-year incarcerative\n\nterm, and a concurrent ten-year incarcerative term.     We affirmed\n\nthe convictions and sentences, Lara, 181 F.3d at 206, and the\n\nSupreme Court eschewed further review, 528 U.S. 1127 (2000).\n\n          A federal criminal conviction becomes final when the\n\nSupreme Court denies certiorari. See Clay v. United States, 123 S.\n\nCt. 1072, 1076 (2003).   Approximately five months after the denial\n\nof certiorari in the petitioner's case, the Court decided Apprendi.\n\nThe central holding of Apprendi is that \"[o]ther than the fact of\n\na prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime\n\nbeyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a\n\njury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\"      530 U.S. at 490.\n\nThis clarion call arguably conflicted with the procedure employed\n\nby the district court in sentencing the petitioner on the witness\n\nintimidation count.   We explain briefly.\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f               The witness intimidation count arose from an incident\n\nwherein the petitioner ordered the \"termination\" of Manuel Pacheco,\n\na   state     prisoner    who    was   assisting     the    authorities     in   their\n\ninvestigation of the Latin Kings.1                 Lara, 181 F.3d at 200.          The\n\npetitioner's order passed through various channels to henchmen\n\n(incarcerated Latin King members) within the penitentiary in which\n\nPacheco was housed.        Id.       At the first opportunity, these acolytes\n\nbeat Pacheco savagely.           Id. at 200-01.\n\n               A defendant convicted of witness intimidation typically\n\nfaces a maximum prison term of ten years.              See 18 U.S.C. § 1512(b).\n\nAt sentencing, however, the government asked the lower court to\n\nenhance the petitioner's sentence pursuant to the Criminal Street\n\nGangs Act, which authorizes a ten-year bump in the sentence of an\n\nindividual      convicted       of   certain     offenses   —   including    witness\n\nintimidation — if it is determined that the individual committed\n\nthe offense \"intend[ing] to promote or further the felonious\n\nactivities of [a] criminal street gang or maintain or increase his\n\nor her position in the gang.\"              Id. § 521(d).     The sentencing court\n\nfound that the petitioner's conviction fit within these confines\n\nand,       accordingly,   imposed      a   twenty-year      sentence   (double     the\n\nmaximum otherwise authorized under the statute of conviction).\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      In Latin King parlance, a \"termination\" can entail anything\nfrom a beating to a slaying. Lara, 181 F.3d at 200.\n\n                                           -4-\n\f            On December 29, 2000, the petitioner filed a federal\n\nhabeas application — technically, an application to vacate, set\n\naside, or correct his sentence — under section 2255.            See Ellis v.\n\nUnited States, 313 F.3d 636, 641 (1st Cir. 2002) (observing that,\n\nas to federal prisoners, section 2255 is in essence \"a surrogate\n\nfor the historic writ of habeas corpus\").          In it, he argued that he\n\nhad been sentenced to a term of imprisonment above the default\n\nstatutory maximum for the crime of conviction based on a judge's\n\nfactual finding that the circumstances attendant to his commission\n\nof that crime warranted the enhancement, and that the resultant\n\nsentence violated the Apprendi rule. The district court denied the\n\napplication,     holding   that     Apprendi      could   not    be   applied\n\nretroactively to cases on collateral review.\n\n            The petitioner moved for a certificate of appealability\n\n(COA).   See 28 U.S.C. § 2253.      We granted the request with respect\n\nto the effect, if any, that the Apprendi decision might have on the\n\npetitioner's conviction for witness intimidation.                This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n            It is beyond cavil that the petitioner's sentence for\n\nwitness intimidation exceeds the default statutory maximum for that\n\ncrime, and that this overage rests on the sentencing court's\n\nfinding that     the   petitioner   had   acted    with   the   intention   of\n\nfurthering the felonious activities of a criminal street gang\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fand/or maintaining his leadership position in such a gang.                     Thus,\n\nthe petitioner has made at least a prima facie showing of a\n\nviolation of the Apprendi rule.2             But the petitioner's conviction\n\nhad already become final before Apprendi was handed down, and the\n\nthreshold question is whether the new rule applies to his case.\n\nSee Derman v. United States, 298 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir. 2002).                   The\n\npetitioner advances two theories in support of the retroactive\n\napplication of the Apprendi rule.                   We address these theories\n\nsequentially.\n\n                         A.    The Teague Exceptions.\n\n          The      Supreme      Court's      decision    in     Teague    v.   Lane\n\nconstitutes a general bar to the retroactive application of newly\n\nannounced rules of criminal procedure.                 Tyler v. Cain, 533 U.S.\n\n656, 665 (2001) (citing Teague, 489 U.S. at 311-13).                     The Teague\n\nbar admits    of   two    exceptions.         The    first    allows   retroactive\n\napplication   of    new       rules   that    either    (a)   prohibit     criminal\n\npunishment for certain types of primary conduct, or (b) forbid the\n\nimposition of certain categories of punishment for particular\n\nclasses of defendants.           O'Dell v. Netherland, 521 U.S. 151, 157\n\n(1997).   This exception is patently inapposite here:                      Apprendi\n\nneither places any particular type of conduct beyond the reach of\n\n\n\n     2\n      The government makes a rather tenuous argument that, even if\nApprendi applies, the rule was not violated here. The government\nalso maintains that any error was harmless.     We need not reach\neither of these issues.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fthe criminal law nor pretermits any particular type of punishment\n\nfor a specific class of defendants. Accord McCoy v. United States,\n\n266 F.3d 1245, 1256 (11th Cir. 2001).         Thus, the petitioner's\n\nchallenge necessarily stands or falls on the strength of the second\n\nexception.\n\n            The   second   Teague     exception   allows    retroactive\n\napplication of \"watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating\n\nthe fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\"\n\nGraham v. Collins, 506 U.S. 461, 478 (1993) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).   For this exception to flourish, the new rule must\n\npass two tests.   First, \"[i]nfringement of the rule must seriously\n\ndiminish the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction.\"\n\nTyler, 533 U.S. at 665 (citations and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    Second, the new rule must itself alter the accepted\n\nunderstanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the\n\nintegrity and fairness of a criminal proceeding.      Id.\n\n            Nothing in the Apprendi decision indicates to us that\n\ninfringements of its rule will seriously diminish the accuracy of\n\nconvictions (which, by definition, must take place before any such\n\ninfringement occurs).      The case before us provides a practical\n\nillustration of why this is so.      The petitioner was tried before a\n\njury and convicted of witness intimidation upon proof of his guilt\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt.     There is no indication that, in the\n\ncourse of his trial, he received less than the process that was\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fdue.   The procedural error to which the petitioner adverts may\n\nraise questions as to the length of his sentence, but inaccuracies\n\nof   this   nature,     occurring      after      a   defendant   has    been     duly\n\nconvicted, are matters of degree and do not trump what the Justices\n\nhave termed \"the general rule of nonretroactivity.\"                      Tyler, 533\n\nU.S. at 665.\n\n            We add, moreover, that the length of the petitioner's\n\nsentence    was   not   plucked       out    of   thin   air,   but,    rather,    was\n\ndetermined by a federal judge based upon discrete findings of fact\n\nestablished by a fair preponderance of the evidence. We agree with\n\nthe Seventh Circuit that findings by federal judges, though now\n\nrendered insufficient in certain instances by Apprendi, nonetheless\n\n\"are adequate to make reliable decisions about punishment.\" Curtis\n\nv. United States, 294 F.3d 841, 844 (7th Cir. 2002).                     After all,\n\neven in the post-Apprendi era, findings of fact made by the\n\nsentencing    judge,     under    a    preponderance       standard,     remain     an\n\nimportant part of the sentencing regimen. See, e.g., United States\n\nv. Caba, 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"[A]fter Apprendi, . .\n\n. sentencing factors that boost a defendant's sentence but do not\n\ntrip a new statutory maximum remain grist for the district judge's\n\nmill under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.\"); see also\n\nUnited States v. Robinson, 241 F.3d 115, 122 (1st Cir. 2001)\n\n(rejecting the argument that when facts found by the judge trigger\n\nor increase a mandatory minimum sentence, an Apprendi violation\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\foccurs).     Consequently, Apprendi's new rule not only fails to\n\nimpugn the accuracy of convictions that became final beforehand but\n\nalso falls short of rendering sentences imposed under the pre-\n\nApprendi regime seriously inaccurate.                  See Goode v. United States,\n\n305 F.3d 378, 385 (6th Cir. 2002); cf. United States v. Sanchez-\n\nCervantes, 282 F.3d 664, 669 (9th Cir. 2002) (\"We do not believe\n\nthat requiring the jury to make drug quantity determinations beyond\n\na   reasonable     doubt     will     greatly          affect       the     accuracy    of\n\nconvictions.\").\n\n             By the same token, we do not believe that the Apprendi\n\nrule   can   be   characterized       as     a       watershed      rule    of    criminal\n\nprocedure. Without in any way denigrating either the importance or\n\nthe impact of Apprendi, that decision cannot plausibly be said to\n\nhave altered the commonly accepted understanding of the bedrock\n\nprocedural elements of our criminal justice system.                        Accord United\n\nStates v. Sanders, 247 F.3d 139, 150 (4th Cir. 2001) (rejecting the\n\nnotion that, pre-Apprendi, \"the country's criminal justice system\n\nmalfunctioned . . . fundamentally\").                    Watershed rules affecting\n\nbedrock    procedural      elements    are       few     and       far    between.     The\n\nquintessential     example     of     such       a    rule     —    the    only   example\n\nspecifically mentioned by the Supreme Court — is the landmark\n\ndecision in Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335 (1963).                                 The\n\n\"sweeping rule of Gideon . . . established an affirmative right to\n\ncounsel in all felony cases.\"                 O'Dell, 521 U.S. at 167.                  It\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fprotected each accused, \"though he be not guilty, [from] the danger\n\nof conviction because he does not know how to establish his\n\ninnocence.\"      Gideon, 372 U.S. at 345 (citation omitted).              This\n\npronouncement — that representation by counsel is fundamental to a\n\nfair trial — reshaped the legal landscape and dramatically revised\n\nthe common understanding of what the Due Process Clause demands in\n\na criminal case.\n\n           Other concrete examples of watershed rules are hen's-\n\nteeth rare.      See Graham, 506 U.S. at 478 (\"[W]e operate from the\n\npremise that such procedures would be so central to an accurate\n\ndetermination of innocence or guilt [that] it [is] unlikely that\n\nmany such components of basic due process have yet to emerge.\").\n\nOne reason for this phenomenon is that the Supreme Court has\n\nexhibited reluctance to showcase prototypes of rules that might\n\nenjoy this venerated status.             That is understandable because the\n\nTeague exception \"is clearly meant to apply only to a small core of\n\nrules requiring observance of those procedures that are implicit in\n\nthe concept of ordered liberty.\"            O'Dell, 521 U.S. at 157.\n\n           Apprendi is not within this small core of cases.                   The\n\nrule that it announces merely assures a previously convicted\n\ndefendant that increased punishment, over and above the default\n\nstatutory maximum, can only be imposed if the factual predicate for\n\nthe   increase    —   other   than   a    prior   criminal   conviction   —    is\n\nconfirmed by a jury to a higher quantum of proof.               See Apprendi,\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\f530 U.S. at 484 (\"If a defendant faces punishment beyond that\n\nprovided by statute when an offense is committed under certain\n\ncircumstances but not others, . . . it necessarily follows that the\n\ndefendant should not . . . be deprived of protections that have,\n\nuntil that point, unquestionably attached.\") (emphasis supplied).\n\nAlthough the Apprendi rule is important as a means of clarifying\n\nthe proper factfinding roles of judge and jury, it affords an\n\ninnocent defendant no additional shield from wrongful conviction.\n\nRefined to bare essence, the rule \"merely limits the potential\n\npenalty to be imposed on [an undoubtedly] guilty defendant\" to that\n\ndesignated by statute.     Goode, 305 F.3d at 385.\n\n          In   sum,   \"a   decision   .   .   .    by   a   judge   (on   the\n\npreponderance standard) rather than a jury (on the reasonable-doubt\n\nstandard) is not the sort of error that necessarily undermines the\n\nfairness . . . of judicial proceedings.\"          Curtis, 294 F.3d at 843.\n\nApplying Apprendi's procedural mandate retroactively would create\n\nan unacceptably high risk that those found guilty of criminal\n\nconduct might escape condign sentences. Hence, we join every court\n\nof appeals that thus far has decided the question and hold that the\n\nApprendi rule fails to qualify as a watershed rule within the\n\nmeaning of the second Teague exception.            See Coleman v. United\n\nStates, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (2d Cir. 2003) [2003 WL 21019559, at\n\n*10]; Goode, 305 F.3d at 382-85; United States v.

The petitioner's reliance on this\n\nstatement demonstrates the verity that a single word often has the\n\ncapacity to convey multiple shades of meaning.                      See Hanover Ins.\n\nCo.   v.   United          States,   880    F.2d   1503,    1504    (1st   Cir.    1989)\n\n(explaining that \"words can be like chameleons, which reflect the\n\ncolor of their environment\") (citation and internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).            Justice O'Connor warned that \"the most significant\n\nimpact     of        the   Court's    decision\"      in    Apprendi      was    that     it\n\n\"threaten[ed] to unleash a flood of petitions by convicted felons\n\nseeking to invalidate their sentences.\"                    530 U.S. at 550-51.

She did not advert to Teague,\n\n\n                                            -12-\n\fand her use of the word \"watershed,\" taken in this context, cannot\n\nplausibly be interpreted as a definitive conclusion that she — or\n\nanyone else — would hold the Apprendi rule to be a watershed rule\n\nfor Teague purposes.\n\n          Next, the petitioner posits that the Apprendi rule is not\n\nstrictly a rule of criminal procedure, but, rather, possesses a\n\nsubstantive component, requiring those facts that warrant sentence\n\nenhancement to be considered elements of an aggravated crime. This\n\nformulation contains more cry than wool.\n\n          The Apprendi decision is about criminal procedure, pure\n\nand simple.   Accord Curtis, 294 F.3d at 843.   Long before the Court\n\ndecided Apprendi, basic principles of criminal and constitutional\n\njurisprudence protected defendants from being convicted on less\n\nthan proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each and every element of\n\na charged crime.     See In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358, 364 (1970)\n\n(holding that \"the Due Process Clause protects the accused against\n\nconviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every\n\nfact   necessary     to   constitute    the     [charged]   crime\").\n\nNotwithstanding the prevalence of this principle, courts routinely\n\napproved the practice of enhancing sentences based on a judge's\n\nfactual determinations.    See, e.g., United States v. Thomas, 204\n\nF.3d 381, 383 (2d Cir. 2000); United States v. Grimaldo, 214 F.3d\n\n967, 974-75 (8th Cir. 2000); United States v. Lindia, 82 F.3d 1154,\n\n1160-61 (1st Cir. 1996). The Apprendi rule limited that widespread\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fpractice.3     The fact that the Apprendi rule implements certain\n\nunderlying constitutional protections makes it no less a rule of\n\ncriminal procedure.      See Sanders, 247 F.3d at 151.        The Supreme\n\nCourt has instructed us that the \"distinction between substance and\n\nprocedure is an important one in the habeas context,\" Bousley v.\n\nUnited States, 523 U.S. 614, 620 (1998), and we cannot disregard\n\nthat distinction in applying the Teague screen.\n\n             In the last analysis, \"[t]he Teague doctrine is founded\n\non the notion that one of the principal functions of habeas corpus\n\nis to assure that no man has been incarcerated under a procedure\n\nwhich creates an impermissibly large risk that the innocent will be\n\nconvicted.\"       Id.   (internal   quotation   marks   and   alterations\n\nomitted). Pre-Apprendi practice, though incorrect, created no such\n\nrisk.    While the Apprendi rule may improve the correlation between\n\ncrime and punishment in future prosecutions, it does not render the\n\ncorrelation for past convictions completely (or even seriously)\n\nunreliable.      Thus, the procedure required by Apprendi has the\n\ncapacity to improve substance — but it is not substance in and of\n\nitself.\n\n             The petitioner's third line of attack attempts to compare\n\nApprendi to the Supreme Court decisions in Bailey v. United States,\n\n\n     3\n      We say \"limited\" rather than \"abolished\" because, even after\nApprendi, it remains constitutionally permissible for judges to\nmake a wide variety of sentence-enhancing factual determinations\nunder the preponderance standard. See, e.g., Robinson, 241 F.3d at\n122; Caba, 241 F.3d at 101.\n\n                                    -14-\n\f516 U.S. 137 (1995), and Richardson v. United States, 526 U.S. 813\n\n(1999).    Based on these comparisons, the petitioner asserts that\n\nthe rationale for applying the Bailey and Richardson doctrines\n\nretroactively supports giving Apprendi retroactive effect.                       We\n\nreject this attempted analogy for the most basic of reasons:                    the\n\ncases are not fair congeners.\n\n              Bailey involved a determination of what conduct Congress\n\ncriminalized in enacting 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1).               The Bailey Court\n\ndetermined     that   \"possession\"      was    not    \"use\"   and    vacated    the\n\ndefendant's conviction.          516 U.S. at 143.     Because Bailey involved\n\nsubstance, not procedure, the decision provides no guidance for a\n\nTeague analysis.      See Bousley, 523 U.S. at 620 (\"[B]ecause Teague\n\nby its terms applies only to procedural rules, we think it is\n\ninapplicable to the situation in which this Court decides the\n\nmeaning of a criminal statute enacted by Congress.\").\n\n              Richardson    is   not   quite   so    far   afield.     That    case\n\ninvolved both the interpretation of a criminal statute and the\n\nprocedural safeguards attendant to a defendant's right to have a\n\njury   make    factual     findings    leading   to   conviction     thereunder.\n\nRichardson, 526 U.S. at 816.            Although the latter half of this\n\nhybrid bears some similarities to Apprendi, the first half strays\n\nfrom Apprendi in so material a way as to undermine the attempted\n\nanalogy.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\f             The core holding in Richardson required jury unanimity as\n\nto each \"violation\" in the \"series of violations\" needed to convict\n\nunder the continuing criminal enterprise (CCE) statute, 21 U.S.C.\n\n§ 848.    See Richardson, 526 U.S. at 818-19.            Jury discordance as to\n\nthe identity of the individual violations that comprised the\n\nnecessary series would threaten the accuracy of any conviction for\n\nviolating    the     CCE    statute,    a     factor   that   makes    retroactive\n\napplication     of    Richardson       more     appropriate    under    a   Teague\n\nanalysis.4    Apprendi errors pose no such threat.             Thus, we find the\n\npetitioner's comparison of Apprendi to Richardson to be like\n\ncomparing a plum to a pomegranate.\n\n             That ends this aspect of the matter.              We hold, without\n\nserious question, that Apprendi prescribes a new rule of criminal\n\nprocedure, and that Teague does not permit inferior federal courts\n\nto apply the Apprendi rule retroactively to cases on collateral\n\nreview.\n\n                       B.    The Effect of the AEDPA.\n\n             This conclusion does not mark the end of our odyssey.\n\nThe petitioner contends in the alternative that a Teague analysis\n\n\n     4\n      This case does not require us to announce a holding as to the\nretroactive effect of Richardson, and we leave that question for\nanother day. We engage in the discussion only to distinguish the\nrationale that may have led other courts to hold Richardson\nretroactively applicable to cases pending on collateral review.\nSee, e.g., Santana-Madera v. United States, 260 F.3d 133, 138-39\n(2d Cir. 2001); United States v. Lopez, 248 F.3d 427, 432 (5th Cir.\n2001); Lanier v. United States, 220 F.3d 833, 838 (7th Cir. 2000);\nMurr v. United States, 200 F.3d 895, 906 (6th Cir. 2000).\n\n                                        -16-\n\fis unnecessary.   This contention rests on the premise that the\n\nAEDPA evinces Congress's intent to displace the Teague doctrine in\n\nthe context of initial section 2255 petitions filed within one year\n\nof the date upon which a conviction becomes final.\n\n          The petitioner's premise derives, in the first instance,\n\nfrom an AEDPA provision governing, inter alia, federal prisoners'\n\ninitial applications for habeas relief under section 2255. Section\n\n2255 consists of a narrative series of unnumbered paragraphs, but\n\nfor ease in reference we cite to the paragraphs by artificially\n\nimposed symbol and number. The provision on which the petitioner's\n\npremise depends reads in pertinent part:\n\n          A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a\n          motion under [section 2255]. The limitation\n          period shall run from the latest of —\n                 (1) the date on which the\n                 judgment of conviction becomes\n                 final;\n                 (2) the date on which the\n                 impediment to making a motion\n                 created by the governmental\n                 action in violation of the\n                 Constitution or laws of the\n                 United States is removed, if the\n                 movant was prevented from making\n                 a motion by such governmental\n                 action;\n                 (3) the date on which the right\n                 asserted      was     initially\n                 recognized by the Supreme Court,\n                 if that right has been newly\n                 recognized by the Supreme Court\n                 and     made      retroactively\n                 applicable     to    cases    on\n                 collateral review; or\n                 (4) the date on which the facts\n                 supporting the claim or claims\n                 presented    could   have   been\n\n                               -17-\n\f                    discovered through the exercise\n                    of due diligence.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2255 ¶6.      The petitioner argues that ¶6(1) allows a\n\nfederal habeas petitioner to file an initial application for post-\n\nconviction    relief   based   on   a    new   rule   of    criminal   procedure\n\nregardless of when the new rule was announced as long as the\n\napplication is filed within one year of the date on which the\n\njudgment     of   conviction   becomes      final.         In   his   view,   this\n\ninterpretation     — which eliminates the need for any retroactivity\n\nanalysis — is legitimized by contrasting the differing language of\n\n¶6(1) with that of ¶6(3), which embodies a specific standard for\n\nwhen new rules may be given retroactive effect in connection with\n\npetitions for section 2255 relief filed more than one year after a\n\nfinal judgment of conviction.           This is an imaginative exercise in\n\nlegal legerdemain, but not a convincing one.\n\n           In discerning the meaning of the words that Congress\n\nwrote, an inquiring court invariably must start with the statutory\n\ntext.   United States v. Charles George Trucking Co., 823 F.2d 685,\n\n688 (1st Cir. 1987).      In parsing that text, \"we will not depart\n\nfrom, or otherwise embellish, the language of a statute absent\n\neither undeniable textual ambiguity or some other extraordinary\n\nconsideration, such as the prospect of yielding a patently absurd\n\nresult.\"     Pritzker v. Yari, 42 F.3d 53, 67-68 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(citations omitted). The commonsense corollary of these principles\n\nis that statutory language can only be ascribed meaning if taken in\n\n                                    -18-\n\fcontext.      United States v. Ahlers, 305 F.3d 54, 57-58 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).     Part of that context is the presumption that, in the\n\nordinary case,       \"Congress   expects      its   statutes      to    be   read   in\n\nconformity with [the Supreme] Court's precedents.\"                     Clay, 123 S.\n\nCt. at 1076.\n\n            Viewed    through    this    prism,     we     find    nothing     in   ¶6\n\nsufficient     to   overturn     the    general     bar    against      retroactive\n\napplication of new rules of criminal procedure set forth in Teague.\n\nIn   terms,    ¶6   deals   strictly      and     solely    with       the   temporal\n\nlimitations for filing section 2255 petitions. See Brown, 305 F.3d\n\nat 307.       The prefatory language and structure of ¶6 reveal an\n\nobvious legislative intent to place a one-year limitation period on\n\nfederal habeas claims that arise under different circumstances.\n\nSee Derman, 298 F.3d at 40 (\"In [the AEDPA], Congress for the first\n\ntime established time limits applicable to the filing of habeas\n\npetitions:      a prisoner (state or federal) has one year from [a\n\ncertain] date . . . within which to seek federal habeas relief.\").\n\n             The succeeding subsections of ¶6 implement and embellish\n\nthis intent.        The baseline rule is contained in ¶6(1).                     This\n\nsubsection unambiguously obligates a federal prisoner to bring all\n\nhabeas claims that are extant at the time of final judgment within\n\none year.     See 28 U.S.C. § 2255 ¶1 (authorizing a federal prisoner\n\nto seek review of a sentence that \"was imposed in violation [of the\n\nlaw] . . . , or is otherwise subject to collateral attack\")\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\f(emphasis supplied). If sentence was imposed consistent with then-\n\nprevailing law and that sentence is not otherwise subject to\n\ncollateral attack, the prisoner has no claim to bring under section\n\n2255.\n\n             Notwithstanding this baseline rule, ¶6(3) holds out the\n\npossibility     that      a   change   in   the   prevailing    law   may   make   a\n\npetitioner's conviction susceptible to collateral review in the\n\nfuture. Thus, if the Supreme Court later announces a new rule that\n\narguably has retroactive application to the conviction, the date of\n\nthat decision marks the accrual of a new habeas claim.                 Under that\n\nparadigm, ¶6(3) provides a further one-year limitation period\n\nwithin      which   the       petitioner    may   bring   his   newborn     claim.5\n\nAnalytically, then, the different sub-parts that constitute ¶6 deal\n\nwith different starting points for the running of the limitation\n\nperiod.     There is no substantive language in ¶6 that realistically\n\ncan be viewed as displacing the wonted application of the Teague\n\ndoctrine to federal habeas claims.                See Goode, 305 F.3d at 384;\n\nBrown, 305 F.3d at 307; Mora, 293 F.3d at 1218.\n\n\n\n\n        5\n      The courts are divided as to whether the incremental one-year\nperiod runs from the date of the Supreme Court's announcement of\nthe new rule or from the date that the new rule is first declared\nto be retroactive. Compare Triestman v. United States, 124 F.3d\n361, 371 & n.13 (2d Cir. 1997) (adopting former interpretation),\nwith Ashley v. United States, 266 F.3d 671, 673 (7th Cir. 2001)\n(adopting latter interpretation). Because the Apprendi rule does\nnot have retroactive application, see supra Part II(A), we have no\nneed to choose between these conflicting views.\n\n                                           -20-\n\f          The   petitioner   has   another    string   to   his   statutory\n\nconstruction bow.    He adverts to a variety of other provisions\n\nwithin the realm of federal habeas law and notes that they are\n\nworded differently than 28 U.S.C. § 2255 ¶6.            See 28 U.S.C. §\n\n2254(d) (imposing restrictions on state prisoners' habeas claims);\n\nid. § 2255 ¶8 (imposing restrictions on federal prisoners' second\n\nor successive habeas petitions).          Invoking the hoary tenet that\n\n\"where Congress includes particular language in one section of a\n\nstatute but omits it in another . . . it is generally presumed that\n\nCongress acted intentionally,\" Duncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 173\n\n(2001), he asserts that we should interpret those provisions that\n\ndo not contain a specific directive about how to apply new Supreme\n\nCourt rules retroactively — such as ¶6(1) — as negating any such\n\nrequirement (and, to that extent, rendering Teague obsolete). This\n\nargument lacks force.\n\n          As the petitioner notes, the language of these provisions\n\ndiffers from the language of 28 U.S.C. § 2255 ¶6(3).               But the\n\nprovisions that the petitioner cites impose different substantive\n\nrules on the retroactivity analysis to be employed.               For that\n\nreason, the canon of construction on which the petitioner relies\n\nfurnishes no sound basis for concluding that because ¶6(1) is\n\nsilent as to retroactivity, anything goes.6       The logical reading —\n\n\n     6\n      Such an interpretation would lead to problematic results.\nUnder it, a defendant whose conviction became final 364 days before\nthe Supreme Court announced a new rule that fell outside the Teague\n\n                                   -21-\n\fand the one that we endorse — is that retroactivity is not\n\nmentioned in ¶6(1) because the impact of new rules announced after\n\nfinal judgment is covered in ¶6(3).          We explain briefly.\n\n              Every provision of federal habeas law is subject to\n\nTeague's doctrinal reach.           See Clay, 123 S. Ct. at 1076.            The\n\nchanged phraseology of section 2254(d) and 2255 ¶8 evinces a\n\ncongressional intent to increase the burden of certain habeas\n\npetitioners above and beyond the baseline demonstration that a case\n\n\"has   been    .   .   .   made   retroactively    applicable   to   cases    on\n\ncollateral review.\"          28 U.S.C. § 2255 ¶6(3).        Accordingly, 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255 ¶8 restricts second or successive habeas petitions\n\nchallenging        federal    convictions    to     those   new      rules    of\n\nconstitutional law explicitly made retroactive by the Supreme Court\n\nitself to cases on collateral review.             See Tyler, 533 U.S. at 662\n\n(holding that the identically worded requirement contained in 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2244(b)(2)(A) is \"satisfied only if [the Supreme] Court\n\nhas held that the new rule is retroactively applicable to cases on\n\ncollateral review\").          The restrictive language of ¶8 plainly\n\nreflects congressional intent to limit the reach of Teague and to\n\n\n\n\nexceptions would have a single day in which to file a habeas\npetition based on that rule, whereas an identically situated\ndefendant whose conviction became final one day prior to the same\nannouncement would have almost a full year to take advantage of the\nnew rule. It confounds rational thinking to conclude that Congress\nintended a habeas petitioner's filing period to depend on so\narbitrary a linkage.\n\n                                      -22-\n\fexact a more stringent retroactivity requirement for second or\n\nsuccessive habeas petitions.           Id.\n\n             Like 28 U.S.C. § 2255 ¶6, 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d) applies to\n\ninitial applications for post-conviction relief.                   Unlike section\n\n2255, however,       section    2254    relates    to    state    prisoners.       It\n\nrequires such petitioners to bear a different burden; they must\n\ndemonstrate that the state court's adjudication of the claim\n\n\"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\n\nunreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\n\ndetermined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\"                    28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2254(d)(1).      That standard reflects congressional concern that,\n\nin   the   interests     of   comity,    federal    courts       should    defer   to\n\nreasonable state-court judgments anent state prisoners — even when\n\nthose judgments are arguably erroneous.                 See Williams v. Taylor,\n\n529 U.S. 362, 385-86 (2000); Sanna v. Dipaolo, 265 F.3d 1, 7-9 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).\n\n             Thus, by imposing these increased burdens on differently\n\nsituated habeas petitioners, sections 2254(d) and 2255 ¶8 function\n\nas two of the AEDPA's gatekeeping provisions.                Mora, 293 F.3d at\n\n1218.      28 U.S.C. § 2255 ¶6 serves a different purpose.                     That\n\nprovision,    in   its    entirety,     deals     exclusively      with    temporal\n\nlimitations    for     the    filing    of   initial     petitions    by    federal\n\nprisoners.    In terms, ¶6(3) does no more than designate a specific\n\nlimitation period for filing motions related to new rules or rights\n\n\n                                        -23-\n\fthat pass through the Teague screen.       Those that fail under Teague\n\nby definition fail to \"appl[y] to cases on collateral review.\"      28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255 ¶6(3).\n\n               That resolves the question regarding Teague's continuing\n\nrelevance.      The short of it is that Teague remains alive and well,\n\nnotwithstanding Congress's enactment of the AEDPA.\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n               We need go no further.7    To recapitulate, we hold (1)\n\nthat the Apprendi rule has no retroactive application to cases in\n\nwhich the judgment of conviction became final before Apprendi was\n\ndecided; and (2) that the passage of the AEDPA does not affect the\n\nwonted application of Teague v. Lane to initial petitions for\n\nhabeas relief filed under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      Because our analysis disposes of the substance of the\npetitioner's claims, we need not address the government's other\ndefenses (including, inter alia, whether the petitioner is\nprocedurally barred from bringing his claims).\n\n                                   -24-\n\f",

The district court repulsed the attack. The petitioner's ensuing appeal presents two questions of first impression within this circuit. The first asks whether the rule announced in <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), applies retroactively to cases on collateral review. The second, relevant only if <i>Apprendi</i> lacks such retroactivity, asks whether the enactment of the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA), Pub.L. No. 104-132, 110 Stat. 1214 (1996), rendered the doctrine of <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), inapplicable to initial petitions for post-conviction relief under section 2255. Concluding, as we do, that <i>Apprendi</i> has no retroactive effect and that <i>Teague</i> is not a dead letter in the AEDPA context, we affirm the denial of the petitioner's habeas corpus application.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner, known in some circles as \"King Paradise,\" was convicted of multiple crimes arising out of his activities as the leader of the Providence chapter of the Almighty Latin King Nation. We affirmed those convictions in <i>United States v. Lara,</i> 181 F.3d 183 (1st Cir.1999). Here, we reconstruct only the factual terrain pertinent to the issues before us, referring those who seek a more detailed topographic model to our earlier opinion. <i>See id.</i> at 190-91.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A grand jury empaneled in the District of Rhode Island returned a thirteen-count indictment against the petitioner and several others. After a lengthy trial, a petit jury convicted the petitioner of racketeering, conspiracy to commit racketeering, murder in aid of racketeering, witness intimidation, and possessing a firearm as a convicted felon. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1962(c), 1962(d), 1959(a), 1512(b)(3), 922(g)(1). The district court imposed three concurrent life sentences, a concurrent twenty-year incarcerative term, and a concurrent ten-year incarcerative term. We affirmed the convictions and sentences, <i>Lara,</i> 181 F.3d at 206, and the Supreme Court eschewed further review, 528 U.S. 1127, 120 S.Ct. 960, 145 L.Ed.2d 833 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal criminal conviction becomes final when the Supreme Court denies certiorari. <i>See Clay v. United States,</i> 537 U.S. 522, 123 S.Ct. 1072, 1076, 155 L.Ed.2d 88 (2003). Approximately five months after the denial of certiorari in the petitioner's case, the Court decided <i>Apprendi.</i> The central holding of <i>Apprendi</i> is that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. This clarion call arguably conflicted with the procedure employed by the district court in sentencing the petitioner on the witness intimidation count. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The witness intimidation count arose from an incident wherein the petitioner ordered the \"termination\" of Manuel Pacheco, a state prisoner who was assisting the authorities in their investigation of the Latin Kings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Lara,</i> 181 F.3d at 200. The petitioner's order passed through various channels to henchmen (incarcerated Latin King members) within the penitentiary in which Pacheco was housed. <i>Id.</i> At the first opportunity, these acolytes beat Pacheco savagely. <i>Id.</i> at 200-01.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant convicted of witness intimidation typically faces a maximum prison term of ten years. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(b). At sentencing, however, the government asked the lower court to enhance the petitioner's sentence pursuant to the Criminal Street Gangs Act, which authorizes a ten-year bump in the sentence of an individual convicted of certain offenses &#8212; including witness intimidation &#8212; if it is determined that the individual committed the offense \"intend[ing] to promote or further the felonious activities of [a] criminal street gang or maintain or increase his or her position in the gang.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 521(d). The sentencing court found that the petitioner's conviction fit within these confines and, accordingly, imposed a twenty-year sentence (double the maximum otherwise authorized under the statute of conviction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 29, 2000, the petitioner filed a federal habeas application &#8212; technically, an application to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence &#8212; under section 2255. <i>See Ellis v. United States,</i> 313 F.3d 636, 641 (1st Cir.2002) (observing that, as to federal prisoners, section 2255 is in essence \"a surrogate for the historic writ of habeas corpus\"). In it, he argued that he had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment above the default statutory maximum for the crime of conviction based on a judge's factual finding that the circumstances attendant to his commission of that crime warranted the enhancement, and that the resultant sentence violated the <i>Apprendi</i> rule. The district court denied the application, holding that <i>Apprendi</i> could not be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner moved for a certificate of appealability (COA). <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253. We granted the request with respect to the effect, if any, that the <i>Apprendi</i> decision might have on the petitioner's conviction for witness intimidation. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beyond cavil that the petitioner's sentence for witness intimidation exceeds the default statutory maximum for that crime, and that this overage rests on the sentencing court's finding that the petitioner had acted with the intention of furthering the felonious activities of a criminal street gang and/or maintaining his leadership position in such a gang. Thus, the petitioner has made at least a prima facie showing of a violation of the <i>Apprendi</i> rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> But the petitioner's conviction had already become final before <i>Apprendi</i> was handed down, and the threshold question is whether the new rule applies to his case. <i>See Derman v. United States,</i> 298 F.3d 34, 39 (1st Cir.2002). The petitioner advances two theories in support of the retroactive application of the <i>Apprendi</i> rule. We address these theories sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Teague Exceptions.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's decision in <i>Teague v. Lane</i> constitutes a general bar to the retroactive application of newly announced rules of criminal procedure. <i>Tyler v. Cain,</i> 533 U.S. 656, 665, 121 S.Ct. 2478, 150 L.Ed.2d 632 (2001) (citing <i>Teague,</i> 489 U.S. at 311-13, 109 S.Ct. 1060). The <i>Teague</i> bar admits of two exceptions. The first allows retroactive application of new rules that either (a) prohibit criminal punishment for certain types of primary conduct, or (b) forbid the imposition of certain categories of punishment for particular classes of defendants. <i>O'Dell v. Netherland,</i> 521 U.S. 151, 157, 117 S.Ct. 1969, 138 L.Ed.2d 351 (1997). This exception is patently inapposite here: <i>Apprendi</i> neither places any particular type of conduct beyond the reach of the criminal law nor pretermits any particular type of punishment for a specific class of defendants. <i>Accord McCoy v. United States,</i> 266 F.3d 1245, 1256 (11th Cir.2001). Thus, the petitioner's challenge necessarily stands or falls on the strength of the second exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second <i>Teague</i> exception allows retroactive application of \"watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\" <i>Graham v. Collins,</i> 506 U.S. 461, 478, 113 S.Ct. 892, 122 L.Ed.2d 260 (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). For this exception to flourish, the new rule must pass two tests. First, \"[i]nfringement of the rule must seriously diminish the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction.\" <i>Tyler,</i> 533 U.S. at 665, 121 S.Ct. 2478 (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Second, the new rule must itself alter the accepted understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the integrity and fairness of a criminal proceeding. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the <i>Apprendi</i> decision indicates to us that infringements of its rule will seriously diminish the accuracy of convictions (which, by definition, must take place before any such infringement occurs). The case before us provides a practical illustration of why this is so. The petitioner was tried before a jury and convicted of witness intimidation upon proof of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no indication that, in the course of his trial, he received less than the process that was due. The procedural error to which the petitioner adverts may raise questions as to the length of his sentence, but inaccuracies of this nature, occurring after a defendant has been duly convicted, are matters of degree and do not trump what the Justices have termed \"the general rule of nonretroactivity.\" <i>Tyler,</i> 533 U.S. at 665, 121 S.Ct. 2478.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that the length of the petitioner's sentence was not plucked out of thin air, but, rather, was determined by a federal judge based upon discrete findings of fact established by a fair preponderance of the evidence. We agree with the Seventh Circuit that findings by federal judges, though now rendered insufficient in certain instances by <i>Apprendi,</i> nonetheless \"are adequate to make reliable decisions about punishment.\" <i>Curtis v. United States,</i> 294 F.3d 841, 844 (7th Cir.2002). After all, even in the post-<i>Apprendi</i> era, findings of fact made by the sentencing judge, under a preponderance standard, remain an important part of the sentencing regimen. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Caba,</i> 241 F.3d 98, 101 (1st Cir.2001) (\"[A]fter <i>Apprendi,</i> ... sentencing factors that boost a defendant's sentence but do not trip a new statutory maximum remain grist for the district judge's mill under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.\"); <i>see also United States v. Robinson,</i> 241 F.3d 115, 122 (1st Cir.2001) (rejecting the argument that when facts found by the judge trigger or increase a mandatory minimum sentence, an <i>Apprendi</i> violation occurs). Consequently, <i>Apprendi's</i> new rule not only fails to impugn the accuracy of convictions that became final beforehand but also falls short of rendering sentences imposed under the pre-<i>Apprendi</i> regime seriously inaccurate. <i>See Goode v. United States,</i> 305 F.3d 378, 385 (6th Cir.2002); <i>cf. United States v. Sanchez-Cervantes,</i> 282 F.3d 664, 669 (9th Cir.2002) (\"We do not believe that requiring the jury to make drug quantity determinations beyond a reasonable doubt will greatly affect the accuracy of convictions.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the same token, we do not believe that the <i>Apprendi</i> rule can be characterized as a watershed rule of criminal procedure. Without in any way denigrating either the importance or the impact of <i>Apprendi,</i> that decision cannot plausibly be said to have altered the commonly accepted understanding of the bedrock procedural elements of our criminal justice system. <i>Accord United States v. Sanders,</i> 247 F.3d 139, 150 (4th Cir.2001) (rejecting the notion that, pre-<i>Apprendi,</i> \"the country's criminal justice system malfunctioned... fundamentally\"). Watershed rules affecting bedrock procedural elements are few and far between. The quintessential example of such a rule &#8212; the only example specifically mentioned by the Supreme Court &#8212; is the landmark decision in <i>Gideon v. Wainwright,</i> 372 U.S. 335, 83 S.Ct. 792, 9 L.Ed.2d 799 (1963). The \"sweeping rule of <i>Gideon</i> ... established an affirmative right to counsel in all felony cases.\" <i>O'Dell,</i> 521 U.S. at 167, 117 S.Ct. 1969. It protected each accused, \"though he be not guilty, [from] the danger of conviction because he does not know how to establish his innocence.\" <i>Gideon,</i> 372 U.S. at 345, 83 S.Ct. 792 (citation omitted). This pronouncement &#8212; that representation by counsel is fundamental to a fair trial &#8212; reshaped the legal landscape and dramatically revised the common understanding of what the Due Process Clause demands in a criminal case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other concrete examples of watershed rules are hen's-teeth rare. <i>See Graham,</i> 506 U.S. at 478, 113 S.Ct. 892 (\"[W]e operate from the premise that such procedures would be so central to an accurate determination of innocence or guilt [that] it [is] unlikely that many such components of basic due process have yet to emerge.\"). One reason for this phenomenon is that the Supreme Court has exhibited reluctance to showcase prototypes of rules that might enjoy this venerated status. That is understandable because the <i>Teague</i> exception \"is clearly meant to apply only to a small core of rules requiring observance of those procedures that are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\" <i>O'Dell,</i> 521 U.S. at 157, 117 S.Ct. 1969.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Apprendi</i> is not within this small core of cases. The rule that it announces merely assures a previously convicted defendant that increased punishment, over and above the default statutory maximum, can only be imposed if the factual predicate for the increase &#8212; other than a prior criminal conviction &#8212; is confirmed by a jury to a higher quantum of proof. <i>See Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S. at 484, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (\"If a defendant faces punishment beyond that provided by statute when an offense is committed under certain circumstances but not others,... it necessarily follows that the defendant should not ... be deprived of protections that have, <i>until that point,</i> unquestionably attached.\") (emphasis supplied). Although the <i>Apprendi</i> rule is important as a means of clarifying the proper factfinding roles of judge and jury, it affords an innocent defendant no additional shield from wrongful conviction. Refined to bare essence, the rule \"merely limits the potential penalty to be imposed on [an undoubtedly] guilty defendant\" to that designated by statute. <i>Goode,</i> 305 F.3d at 385.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, \"a decision ... by a judge (on the preponderance standard) rather than a jury (on the reasonable-doubt standard) is not the sort of error that necessarily undermines the fairness ... of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Curtis,</i> 294 F.3d at 843. Applying <i>Apprendi's</i> procedural mandate retroactively would create an unacceptably high risk that those found guilty of criminal conduct might escape condign sentences. Hence, we join every court of appeals that thus far has decided the question and hold that the <i>Apprendi</i> rule fails to qualify as a watershed rule within the meaning of the second <i>Teague</i> exception. <i>See Coleman v. United States,</i> 329 F.3d 77, 81 (2d Cir.2003); <i>Goode,</i> 305 F.3d at 382-85; <i>United States v. Brown,</i> 305 F.3d 304, 307-10 (5th Cir.2002) (per curiam); <i>Curtis,</i> 294 F.3d at 843-44; <i>United States v. Mora,</i> 293 F.3d 1213, 1218-19 (10th Cir.2002); <i>Sanchez-Cervantes,</i> 282 F.3d at 667; <i>McCoy,</i> 266 F.3d at 1257-58; <i>United States v. Moss,</i> 252 F.3d 993, 997 (8th Cir.2001); <i>Sanders,</i> 247 F.3d at 151.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an effort to turn aside the combined force of reasoning and precedent, the petitioner offers several diversions. None is persuasive, but three of his sallies merit brief comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the first place, the petitioner emphasizes that no less an authority than Justice O'Connor has characterized the majority opinion in <i>Apprendi</i> as one that announces \"a watershed change in constitutional law.\" <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S. at 524, 120 S.Ct. 2348 (O'Connor, J. dissenting). The petitioner's reliance on this statement demonstrates the verity that a single word often has the capacity to convey multiple shades of meaning. <i>See Hanover Ins. Co. v. United States,</i> 880 F.2d 1503, 1504 (1st Cir.1989) (explaining that \"words can be like chameleons, which reflect the color of their environment\") (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). Justice O'Connor warned that \"the most significant impact of the Court's decision\" in <i>Apprendi</i> was that it \"threaten[ed] to unleash a flood of petitions by convicted felons seeking to invalidate their sentences.\" 530 U.S. at 550-51, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Her concern was \"a practical one,\" prompting her to chastise the majority for \"not say[ing] whether [determinate-sentencing] schemes are constitutional.\" <i>Id.</i> at 550, 120 S.Ct. 2348. She did not advert to <i>Teague,</i> and her use of the word \"watershed,\" taken in this context, cannot plausibly be interpreted as a definitive conclusion that she &#8212; or anyone else &#8212; would hold the <i>Apprendi</i> rule to be a watershed rule for <i>Teague</i> purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the petitioner posits that the <i>Apprendi</i> rule is not strictly a rule of criminal procedure, but, rather, possesses a substantive component, requiring those facts that warrant sentence enhancement to be considered elements of an aggravated crime. This formulation contains more cry than wool.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Apprendi</i> decision is about criminal procedure, pure and simple. <i>Accord Curtis,</i> 294 F.3d at 843. Long before the Court decided <i>Apprendi,</i> basic principles of criminal and constitutional jurisprudence protected defendants from being convicted on less than proof beyond a reasonable doubt of each and every element of a charged crime. <i>See In re Winship,</i> 397 U.S. 358, 364, 90 S.Ct. 1068, 25 L.Ed.2d 368 (1970) (holding that \"the Due Process Clause protects the accused against conviction except upon proof beyond a reasonable doubt of every fact necessary to constitute the [charged] crime\"). Notwithstanding the prevalence of this principle, courts routinely approved the practice of enhancing sentences based on a judge's factual determinations. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Thomas,</i> 204 F.3d 381, 383 (2d Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Grimaldo,</i> 214 F.3d 967, 974-75 (8th Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Lindia,</i> 82 F.3d 1154, 1160-61 (1st Cir.1996). The <i>Apprendi</i> rule limited that widespread practice.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The fact that the <i>Apprendi</i> rule implements certain underlying constitutional protections makes it no less a rule of criminal procedure. <i>See Sanders,</i> 247 F.3d at 151. The Supreme Court has instructed us that the \"distinction between substance and procedure is an important one in the habeas context,\" <i>Bousley v. United States,</i> 523 U.S. 614, 620, 118 S.Ct. 1604, 140 L.Ed.2d 828 (1998), and we cannot disregard that distinction in applying the <i>Teague</i> screen.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the last analysis, \"[t]he <i>Teague</i> doctrine is founded on the notion that one of the principal functions of habeas corpus is to assure that no man has been incarcerated under a procedure which creates an impermissibly large risk that the innocent will be convicted.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and alterations omitted). Pre-<i>Apprendi</i> practice, though incorrect, created no such risk. While the <i>Apprendi</i> rule may improve the correlation between crime and punishment in future prosecutions, it does not render the correlation for past convictions completely (or even seriously) unreliable. Thus, the procedure required by <i>Apprendi</i> has the capacity to improve substance &#8212; but it is not substance in and of itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's third line of attack attempts to compare <i>Apprendi</i> to the Supreme Court decisions in <i>Bailey v. United States,</i> 516 U.S. 137, 116 S.Ct. 501, 133 L.Ed.2d 472 (1995), and <i>Richardson v. United States,</i> 526 U.S. 813, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999). Based on these comparisons, the petitioner asserts that the rationale for applying the <i>Bailey</i> and <i>Richardson</i> doctrines retroactively supports giving <i>Apprendi</i> retroactive effect. We reject this attempted analogy for the most basic of reasons: the cases are not fair congeners.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Bailey</i> involved a determination of what conduct Congress criminalized in enacting 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1). The <i>Bailey</i> Court determined that \"possession\" was not \"use\" and vacated the defendant's conviction. 516 U.S. at 143, 116 S.Ct. 501. Because <i>Bailey</i> involved substance, not procedure, the decision provides no guidance for a <i>Teague</i> analysis. <i>See Bousley,</i> 523 U.S. at 620, 118 S.Ct. 1604 (\"[B]ecause <i>Teague</i> by its terms applies only to procedural rules, we think it is inapplicable to the situation in which this Court decides the meaning of a criminal statute enacted by Congress.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Richardson</i> is not quite so far afield. That case involved both the interpretation of a criminal statute and the procedural safeguards attendant to a defendant's right to have a jury make factual findings leading to conviction thereunder. <i>Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 816, 119 S.Ct. 1707. Although the latter half of this hybrid bears some similarities to <i>Apprendi,</i> the first half strays from <i>Apprendi</i> in so material a way as to undermine the attempted analogy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The core holding in <i>Richardson</i> required jury unanimity as to each \"violation\" in the \"series of violations\" needed to convict under the continuing criminal enterprise (CCE) statute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 848. <i>See Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 818-19, 119 S.Ct. 1707. Jury discordance as to the identity of the individual violations that comprised the necessary series would threaten the accuracy of any conviction for violating the CCE statute, a factor that makes retroactive application of <i>Richardson</i> more appropriate under a <i>Teague</i> analysis.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>Apprendi</i> errors pose no such threat. Thus, we find the petitioner's comparison of <i>Apprendi</i> to <i>Richardson</i> to be like comparing a plum to a pomegranate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. We hold, without serious question, that <i>Apprendi</i> prescribes a new rule of criminal procedure, and that <i>Teague</i> does not permit inferior federal courts to apply the <i>Apprendi</i> rule retroactively to cases on collateral review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Effect of the AEDPA.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This conclusion does not mark the end of our odyssey. The petitioner contends in the alternative that a <i>Teague</i> analysis is unnecessary. This contention rests on the premise that the AEDPA evinces Congress's intent to displace the <i>Teague</i> doctrine in the context of initial section 2255 petitions filed within one year of the date upon which a conviction becomes final.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner's premise derives, in the first instance, from an AEDPA provision governing, inter alia, federal prisoners' initial applications for habeas relief under section 2255. Section 2255 consists of a narrative series of unnumbered paragraphs, but for ease in reference we cite to the paragraphs by artificially imposed symbol and number. The provision on which the petitioner's premise depends reads in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under [section 2255]. The limitation period shall run from the latest of &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) the date on which the impediment to making a motion created by the governmental action in violation of the Constitution or laws of the United States is removed, if the movant was prevented from making a motion by such governmental action;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) the date on which the right asserted was initially recognized by the Supreme Court, if that right has been newly recognized by the Supreme Court and made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) the date on which the facts supporting the claim or claims presented could have been discovered through the exercise of due diligence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 &#182; 6. The petitioner argues that &#182; 6(1) allows a federal habeas petitioner to file an initial application for post-conviction relief based on a new rule of criminal procedure regardless of when the new rule was announced as long as the application is filed within one year of the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final. In his view, this interpretation &#8212; which eliminates the need for <i>any</i> retroactivity analysis &#8212; is legitimized by contrasting the differing language of &#182; 6(1) with that of &#182; 6(3), which embodies a specific standard for when new rules may be given retroactive effect in connection with petitions for section 2255 relief filed more than one year after a final judgment of conviction. This is an imaginative exercise in legal legerdemain, but not a convincing one.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In discerning the meaning of the words that Congress wrote, an inquiring court invariably must start with the statutory text. <i>United States v. Charles George Trucking Co.,</i> 823 F.2d 685, 688 (1st Cir.1987). In parsing that text, \"we will not depart from, or otherwise embellish, the language of a statute absent either undeniable textual ambiguity or some other extraordinary consideration, such as the prospect of yielding a patently absurd result.\" <i>Pritzker v. Yari,</i> 42 F.3d 53, 67-68 (1st Cir.1994) (citations omitted). The commonsense corollary of these principles is that statutory language can only be ascribed meaning if taken in context. <i>United States v. Ahlers,</i> 305 F.3d 54, 57-58 (1st Cir.2002). Part of that context is the presumption that, in the ordinary case, \"Congress expects its statutes to be read in conformity with [the Supreme] Court's precedents.\" <i>Clay,</i> 123 S.Ct. at 1076.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed through this prism, we find nothing in &#182; 6 sufficient to overturn the general bar against retroactive application of new rules of criminal procedure set forth in <i>Teague.</i> In terms, &#182; 6 deals strictly and solely with the temporal limitations for filing section 2255 petitions. <i>See Brown,</i> 305 F.3d at 307. The prefatory language and structure of &#182; 6 reveal an obvious legislative intent to place a one-year limitation period on federal habeas claims that arise under different circumstances. <i>See Derman,</i> 298 F.3d at 40 (\"In [the AEDPA], Congress for the first time established time limits applicable to the filing of habeas petitions: a prisoner (state or federal) has one year from [a certain] date ... within which to seek federal habeas relief.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The succeeding subsections of &#182; 6 implement and embellish this intent. The baseline rule is contained in &#182; 6(1). This subsection unambiguously obligates a federal prisoner to bring all habeas claims that are extant at the time of final judgment within one year. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 &#182; 1 (authorizing a federal prisoner to seek review of a sentence that \"<i>was</i> imposed in violation [of the law] ..., or <i>is</i> otherwise subject to collateral attack\") (emphasis supplied). If sentence was imposed consistent with then-prevailing law and that sentence is not otherwise subject to collateral attack, the prisoner has no claim to bring under section 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding this baseline rule, &#182; 6(3) holds out the possibility that a change in the prevailing law may make a petitioner's conviction susceptible to collateral review in the future. Thus, if the Supreme Court later announces a new rule that arguably has retroactive application to the conviction, the date of that decision marks the accrual of a new habeas claim. Under that paradigm, &#182; 6(3) provides a further one-year limitation period within which the petitioner may bring his newborn claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Analytically, then, the different sub-parts that constitute &#182; 6 deal with different starting points for the running of the limitation period. There is no substantive language in &#182; 6 that realistically can be viewed as displacing the wonted application of the <i>Teague</i> doctrine to federal habeas claims. <i>See Goode,</i> 305 F.3d at 384; <i>Brown,</i> 305 F.3d at 307; <i>Mora,</i> 293 F.3d at 1218.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner has another string to his statutory construction bow. He adverts to a variety of other provisions within the realm of federal habeas law and notes that they are worded differently than 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 &#182; 6. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d) (imposing restrictions on state prisoners' habeas claims); <i>id.</i> &#167; 2255 &#182; 8 (imposing restrictions on federal prisoners' second or successive habeas petitions). Invoking the hoary tenet that \"where Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another ... it is generally presumed that Congress acted intentionally,\" <i>Duncan v. Walker,</i> 533 U.S. 167, 173, 121 S.Ct. 2120, 150 L.Ed.2d 251 (2001), he asserts that we should interpret those provisions that do not contain a specific directive about how to apply new Supreme Court rules retroactively &#8212; such as &#182; 6(1) &#8212; as negating any such requirement (and, to that extent, rendering <i>Teague</i> obsolete). This argument lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the petitioner notes, the language of these provisions differs from the language of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 &#182; 6(3). But the provisions that the petitioner cites impose different substantive rules on the retroactivity analysis to be employed. For that reason, the canon of construction on which the petitioner relies furnishes no sound basis for concluding that because &#182; 6(1) is silent as to retroactivity, anything goes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The logical reading &#8212; and the one that we endorse &#8212; is that retroactivity is not mentioned in &#182; 6(1) because the impact of new rules announced after final judgment is covered in &#182; 6(3). We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Every provision of federal habeas law is subject to <i>Teague's</i> doctrinal reach. <i>See Clay,</i> 123 S.Ct. at 1076. The changed phraseology of section 2254(d) and 2255 &#182; 8 evinces a congressional intent to increase the burden of certain habeas petitioners above and beyond the baseline demonstration that a case \"has been ... made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 &#182; 6(3). Accordingly, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 &#182; 8 restricts second or successive habeas petitions challenging federal convictions to those new rules of constitutional law explicitly made retroactive by the Supreme Court itself to cases on collateral review. <i>See Tyler,</i> 533 U.S. at 662, 121 S.Ct. 2478 (holding that the identically worded requirement contained in 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2244(b)(2)(A) is \"satisfied only if [the Supreme] Court has held that the new rule is retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review\"). The restrictive language of &#182; 8 plainly reflects congressional intent to limit the reach of <i>Teague</i> and to exact a more stringent retroactivity requirement for second or successive habeas petitions. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 &#182; 6, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d) applies to initial applications for post-conviction relief. Unlike section 2255, however, section 2254 relates to state prisoners. It requires such petitioners to bear a different burden; they must demonstrate that the state court's adjudication of the claim \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1). That standard reflects congressional concern that, in the interests of comity, federal courts should defer to reasonable state-court judgments anent state prisoners &#8212; even when those judgments are arguably erroneous. <i>See Williams v. Taylor,</i> 529 U.S. 362, 385-86, 120 S.Ct. 1495, 146 L.Ed.2d 389 (2000); <i>Sanna v. Dipaolo,</i> 265 F.3d 1, 7-9 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, by imposing these increased burdens on differently situated habeas petitioners, sections 2254(d) and 2255 &#182; 8 function as two of the AEDPA's gatekeeping provisions. <i>Mora,</i> 293 F.3d at 1218. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 &#182; 6 serves a different purpose. That provision, in its entirety, deals exclusively with temporal limitations for the filing of initial petitions by federal prisoners. In terms, &#182; 6(3) does no more than designate a specific limitation period for filing motions related to new rules or rights that pass through the <i>Teague</i> screen. Those that fail under <i>Teague</i> by definition fail to \"appl[y] to cases on collateral review.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 &#182; 6(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That resolves the question regarding <i>Teague's</i> continuing relevance. The short of it is that <i>Teague</i> remains alive and well, notwithstanding Congress's enactment of the AEDPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> To recapitulate, we hold (1) that the <i>Apprendi</i> rule has no retroactive application to cases in which the judgment of conviction became final before <i>Apprendi</i> was decided; and (2) that the passage of the AEDPA does not affect the wonted application of <i>Teague v.

We engage in the discussion only to distinguish the rationale that may have led other courts to hold <i>Richardson</i> retroactively applicable to cases pending on collateral review. <i>See, e.g., Santana-Madera v. United States,</i> 260 F.3d 133, 138-39 (2d Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 248 F.3d 427, 432 (5th Cir.2001); <i>Lanier v. United States,</i> 220 F.3d 833, 838 (7th Cir.2000); <i>Murr v.

United States,</i> 266 F.3d 671, 673 (7th Cir.2001) (adopting latter interpretation). Because the <i>Apprendi</i> rule does not have retroactive application, <i>see supra</i> Part II(A), we have no need to choose between these conflicting views.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Such an interpretation would lead to problematic results.

The district court repulsed the attack. The petitioner's ensuing appeal presents two questions of first impression within this circuit. The first asks whether the rule announced in <i>Apprendi v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span> (2003). Approximately five months after the denial of certiorari in the petitioner's case, the Court decided <i>Apprendi.</i> The central holding of <i>Apprendi</i> is that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 530 U.S. at 490, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2348</span></a></span>. This clarion call arguably conflicted with the procedure employed by the district court in sentencing the petitioner on the witness intimidation count. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The witness intimidation count arose from an incident wherein the petitioner ordered the \"termination\" of Manuel Pacheco, a state prisoner who was assisting the authorities in their investigation of the Latin Kings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Lara,</i> 181 F.3d at 200. The petitioner's order passed through various channels to henchmen (incarcerated Latin King members) within the penitentiary in which Pacheco was housed. <i>Id.</i> At the first opportunity, these acolytes beat Pacheco savagely. <i>Id.</i> at 200-01.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant convicted of witness intimidation typically faces a maximum prison term of ten years. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1512(b). At sentencing, however, the government asked the lower court to enhance the petitioner's sentence pursuant to the Criminal Street Gangs Act, which authorizes a ten-year bump in the sentence of an individual convicted of certain offenses &#8212; including witness intimidation &#8212; if it is determined that the individual committed the offense \"intend[ing] to promote or further the felonious activities of [a] criminal street gang or maintain or increase his or her position in the gang.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 521(d). The sentencing court found that the petitioner's conviction fit within these confines and, accordingly, imposed a twenty-year sentence (double the maximum otherwise authorized under the statute of conviction).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 29, 2000, the petitioner filed a federal habeas application &#8212; technically, an application to vacate, set aside, or correct his sentence &#8212; under section 2255. <i>See Ellis v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200248\"><a href=\"/opinion/200248/ellis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></a></span>, 641 (1st Cir.2002) (observing that, as to federal prisoners, section 2255 is in essence \"a surrogate for the historic writ of habeas corpus\"). In it, he argued that he had been sentenced to a term of imprisonment above the default statutory maximum for the crime of conviction based on a judge's factual finding that the circumstances attendant to his commission of that crime warranted the enhancement, and that the resultant sentence violated the <i>Apprendi</i> rule. The district court denied the application, holding that <i>Apprendi</i> could not be applied retroactively to cases on collateral review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner moved for a certificate of appealability (COA). <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2253. We granted the request with respect to the effect, if any, that the <i>Apprendi</i> decision might have on the petitioner's conviction for witness intimidation. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is beyond cavil that the petitioner's sentence for witness intimidation exceeds the default statutory maximum for that crime, and that this overage rests on the sentencing court's finding that the petitioner had acted with the intention of furthering the felonious activities of a criminal street gang and/or maintaining his leadership position in such a gang. Thus, the petitioner has made at least a prima facie showing of a violation of the <i>Apprendi</i> rule.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> But the petitioner's conviction had already become final before <i>Apprendi</i> was handed down, and the threshold question is whether the new rule applies to his case. <i>See Derman v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200045\"><a href=\"/opinion/200045/derman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 39 (1st Cir.2002). The petitioner advances two theories in support of the retroactive application of the <i>Apprendi</i> rule. We address these theories sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Teague Exceptions.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's decision in <i>Teague v. Lane</i> constitutes a general bar to the retroactive application of newly announced rules of criminal procedure. <i>Tyler v. Cain,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118460\"><a href=\"/opinion/118460/tyler-v-cain/\"><span class=\"volume\">533</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">656</span></a></span>, 665, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118460\"><a href=\"/opinion/118460/tyler-v-cain/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">632</span></a></span> (2001) (citing <i>Teague,</i> 489 U.S. at 311-13, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112206\"><a href=\"/opinion/112206/teague-v-lane/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1060</span></a></span>). The <i>Teague</i> bar admits of two exceptions. The first allows retroactive application of new rules that either (a) prohibit criminal punishment for certain types of primary conduct, or (b) forbid the imposition of certain categories of punishment for particular classes of defendants. <i>O'Dell v. Netherland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118131\"><a href=\"/opinion/118131/odell-v-netherland/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">151</span></a></span>, 157, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118131\"><a href=\"/opinion/118131/odell-v-netherland/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">351</span></a></span> (1997). This exception is patently inapposite here: <i>Apprendi</i> neither places any particular type of conduct beyond the reach of the criminal law nor pretermits any particular type of punishment for a specific class of defendants. <i>Accord McCoy v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"75622\"><a href=\"/opinion/75622/chester-mccoy-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1245</span></a></span>, 1256 (11th Cir.2001). Thus, the petitioner's challenge necessarily stands or falls on the strength of the second exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second <i>Teague</i> exception allows retroactive application of \"watershed rules of criminal procedure implicating the fundamental fairness and accuracy of the criminal proceeding.\" <i>Graham v. Collins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112810\"><a href=\"/opinion/112810/graham-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 478, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112810\"><a href=\"/opinion/112810/graham-v-collins/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">260</span></a></span> (1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). For this exception to flourish, the new rule must pass two tests. First, \"[i]nfringement of the rule must seriously diminish the likelihood of obtaining an accurate conviction.\" <i>Tyler,</i> 533 U.S. at 665, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118460\"><a href=\"/opinion/118460/tyler-v-cain/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2478</span></a></span> (citations and internal quotation marks omitted). Second, the new rule must itself alter the accepted understanding of the bedrock procedural elements essential to the integrity and fairness of a criminal proceeding. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the <i>Apprendi</i> decision indicates to us that infringements of its rule will seriously diminish the accuracy of convictions (which, by definition, must take place before any such infringement occurs). The case before us provides a practical illustration of why this is so. The petitioner was tried before a jury and convicted of witness intimidation upon proof of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. There is no indication that, in the course of his trial, he received less than the process that was due. The procedural error to which the petitioner adverts may raise questions as to the length of his sentence, but inaccuracies of this nature, occurring after a defendant has been duly convicted, are matters of degree and do not trump what the Justices have termed \"the general rule of nonretroactivity.\" <i>Tyler,</i> 533 U.S. at 665, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118460\"><a href=\"/opinion/118460/tyler-v-cain/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2478</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that the length of the petitioner's sentence was not plucked out of thin air, but, rather, was determined by a federal judge based upon discrete findings of fact established by a fair preponderance of the evidence. We agree with the Seventh Circuit that findings by federal judges, though now rendered insufficient in certain instances by <i>Apprendi,</i> nonetheless \"are adequate to make reliable decisions about punishment.\" <i>Curtis v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778111\"><a href=\"/opinion/778111/jeffrey-p-curtis-and-martin-a-sax-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">841</span></a></span>, 844 (7th Cir.2002). After all, even in the post-<i>Apprendi</i> era, findings of fact made by the sentencing judge, under a preponderance standard, remain an important part of the sentencing regimen. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Caba,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199298\"><a href=\"/opinion/199298/united-states-v-caba/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span>, 101 (1st Cir.2001) (\"[A]fter <i>Apprendi,</i> ... sentencing factors that boost a defendant's sentence but do not trip a new statutory maximum remain grist for the district judge's mill under a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard.\"); <i>see also United States v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199304\"><a href=\"/opinion/199304/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">115</span></a></span>, 122 (1st Cir.2001) (rejecting the argument that when facts found by the judge trigger or increase a mandatory minimum sentence, an <i>Apprendi</i> violation occurs). Consequently, <i>Apprendi's</i> new rule not only fails to impugn the accuracy of convictions that became final beforehand but also falls short of rendering sentences imposed under the pre-<i>Apprendi</i> regime seriously inaccurate. <i>See Goode v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779286\"><a href=\"/opinion/779286/kevin-antonio-goode-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span>, 385 (6th Cir.2002); <i>cf. United States v. Sanchez-Cervantes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776806\"><a href=\"/opinion/776806/united-states-v-juan-sanchez-cervantes-aka-hugo-quirox-quiroc-quiroz/\"><span class=\"volume\">282</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span>, 669 (9th Cir.2002) (\"We do not believe that requiring the jury to make drug quantity determinations beyond a reasonable doubt will greatly affect the accuracy of convictions.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the same token, we do not believe that the <i>Apprendi</i> rule can be characterized as a watershed rule of criminal procedure. Without in any way denigrating either the importance or the impact of <i>Apprendi,</i> that decision cannot plausibly be said to have altered the commonly accepted understanding of the bedrock procedural elements of our criminal justice system. <i>Accord United States v. Sanders,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772915\"><a href=\"/opinion/772915/united-states-v-sean-lamar-sanders-aka-sean-lamont-sanders/\"><span class=\"volume\">247</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 150 (4th Cir.2001) (rejecting the notion that, pre-<i>Apprendi,</i> \"the country's criminal justice system malfunctioned... fundamentally\"). Watershed rules affecting bedrock procedural elements are few and far between. The quintessential example of such a rule &#8212; the only example specifically mentioned by the Supreme Court &#8212; is the landmark decision in <i>Gideon v.

One reason for this phenomenon is that the Supreme Court has exhibited reluctance to showcase prototypes of rules that might enjoy this venerated status. That is understandable because the <i>Teague</i> exception \"is clearly meant to apply only to a small core of rules requiring observance of those procedures that are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty.\" <i>O'Dell,</i> 521 U.S. at 157, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118131\"><a href=\"/opinion/118131/odell-v-netherland/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The rule that it announces merely assures a previously convicted defendant that increased punishment, over and above the default statutory maximum, can only be imposed if the factual predicate for the increase &#8212; other than a prior criminal conviction &#8212; is confirmed by a jury to a higher quantum of proof. <i>See Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S. at 484, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although the <i>Apprendi</i> rule is important as a means of clarifying the proper factfinding roles of judge and jury, it affords an innocent defendant no additional shield from wrongful conviction. Refined to bare essence, the rule \"merely limits the potential penalty to be imposed on [an undoubtedly] guilty defendant\" to that designated by statute. <i>Goode,</i> 305 F.3d at 385.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, \"a decision ... by a judge (on the preponderance standard) rather than a jury (on the reasonable-doubt standard) is not the sort of error that necessarily undermines the fairness ... of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Curtis,</i> 294 F.3d at 843. Applying <i>Apprendi's</i> procedural mandate retroactively would create an unacceptably high risk that those found guilty of criminal conduct might escape condign sentences.

Section 2255 consists of a narrative series of unnumbered paragraphs, but for ease in reference we cite to the paragraphs by artificially imposed symbol and number. The provision on which the petitioner's premise depends reads in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A 1-year period of limitation shall apply to a motion under [section 2255].

The petitioner argues that &#182; 6(1) allows a federal habeas petitioner to file an initial application for post-conviction relief based on a new rule of criminal procedure regardless of when the new rule was announced as long as the application is filed within one year of the date on which the judgment of conviction becomes final. In his view, this interpretation &#8212; which eliminates the need for <i>any</i> retroactivity analysis &#8212; is legitimized by contrasting the differing language of &#182; 6(1) with that of &#182; 6(3), which embodies a specific standard for when new rules may be given retroactive effect in connection with petitions for section 2255 relief filed more than one year after a final judgment of conviction.

Part of that context is the presumption that, in the ordinary case, \"Congress expects its statutes to be read in conformity with [the Supreme] Court's precedents.\" <i>Clay,</i> 123 S.Ct. at 1076.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed through this prism, we find nothing in &#182; 6 sufficient to overturn the general bar against retroactive application of new rules of criminal procedure set forth in <i>Teague.</i> In terms, &#182; 6 deals strictly and solely with the temporal limitations for filing section 2255 petitions. <i>See Brown,</i> 305 F.3d at 307. The prefatory language and structure of &#182; 6 reveal an obvious legislative intent to place a one-year limitation period on federal habeas claims that arise under different circumstances. <i>See Derman,</i> 298 F.3d at 40 (\"In [the AEDPA], Congress for the first time established time limits applicable to the filing of habeas petitions: a prisoner (state or federal) has one year from [a certain] date ... within which to seek federal habeas relief.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The succeeding subsections of &#182; 6 implement and embellish this intent. The baseline rule is contained in &#182; 6(1). This subsection unambiguously obligates a federal prisoner to bring all habeas claims that are extant at the time of final judgment within one year. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 &#182; 1 (authorizing a federal prisoner to seek review of a sentence that \"<i>was</i> imposed in violation [of the law] ..., or <i>is</i> otherwise subject to collateral attack\") (emphasis supplied). If sentence was imposed consistent with then-prevailing law and that sentence is not otherwise subject to collateral attack, the prisoner has no claim to bring under section 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding this baseline rule, &#182; 6(3) holds out the possibility that a change in the prevailing law may make a petitioner's conviction susceptible to collateral review in the future. Thus, if the Supreme Court later announces a new rule that arguably has retroactive application to the conviction, the date of that decision marks the accrual of a new habeas claim. Under that paradigm, &#182; 6(3) provides a further one-year limitation period within which the petitioner may bring his newborn claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Analytically, then, the different sub-parts that constitute &#182; 6 deal with different starting points for the running of the limitation period. There is no substantive language in &#182; 6 that realistically can be viewed as displacing the wonted application of the <i>Teague</i> doctrine to federal habeas claims. <i>See Goode,</i> 305 F.3d at 384; <i>Brown,</i> 305 F.3d at 307; <i>Mora,</i> 293 F.3d at 1218.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner has another string to his statutory construction bow.

This argument lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the petitioner notes, the language of these provisions differs from the language of 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 &#182; 6(3). But the provisions that the petitioner cites impose different substantive rules on the retroactivity analysis to be employed. For that reason, the canon of construction on which the petitioner relies furnishes no sound basis for concluding that because &#182; 6(1) is silent as to retroactivity, anything goes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The logical reading &#8212; and the one that we endorse &#8212; is that retroactivity is not mentioned in &#182; 6(1) because the impact of new rules announced after final judgment is covered in &#182; 6(3).

The changed phraseology of section 2254(d) and 2255 &#182; 8 evinces a congressional intent to increase the burden of certain habeas petitioners above and beyond the baseline demonstration that a case \"has been ... made retroactively applicable to cases on collateral review.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 &#182; 6(3). Accordingly, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 &#182; 8 restricts second or successive habeas petitions challenging federal convictions to those new rules of constitutional law explicitly made retroactive by the Supreme Court itself to cases on collateral review. <i>See Tyler,</i> 533 U.S. at 662, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118460\"><a href=\"/opinion/118460/tyler-v-cain/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The restrictive language of &#182; 8 plainly reflects congressional intent to limit the reach of <i>Teague</i> and to exact a more stringent retroactivity requirement for second or successive habeas petitions. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 &#182; 6, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d) applies to initial applications for post-conviction relief. Unlike section 2255, however, section 2254 relates to state prisoners. It requires such petitioners to bear a different burden; they must demonstrate that the state court's adjudication of the claim \"resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States.\" 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)(1).

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> To recapitulate, we hold (1) that the <i>Apprendi</i> rule has no retroactive application to cases in which the judgment of conviction became final before <i>Apprendi</i> was decided; and (2) that the passage of the AEDPA does not affect the wonted application of <i>Teague v. Lane</i> to initial petitions for habeas relief filed under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In Latin King parlance, a \"termination\" can entail anything from a beating to a slaying<i>Lara,</i> 181 F.3d at 200.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The government makes a rather tenuous argument that, even if<i>Apprendi</i> applies, the rule was not violated here. The government also maintains that any error was harmless. We need not reach either of these issues.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> We say \"limited\" rather than \"abolished\" because, even after<i>Apprendi,</i> it remains constitutionally permissible for judges to make a wide variety of sentence-enhancing factual determinations under the preponderance standard. <i>See, e.g., Robinson,</i> 241 F.3d at 122; <i>Caba,</i> 241 F.3d at 101.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> This case does not require us to announce a holding as to the retroactive effect of<i>Richardson,</i> and we leave that question for another day. We engage in the discussion only to distinguish the rationale that may have led other courts to hold <i>Richardson</i> retroactively applicable to cases pending on collateral review. <i>See, e.g., Santana-Madera v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774387\"><a href=\"/opinion/774387/leonardo-r-santana-madera-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 138-39 (2d Cir.2001); <i>United States v.

United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"746218\"><a href=\"/opinion/746218/ben-gary-triestman-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">361</span></a></span>, 371 &amp; n. 13 (2d Cir.1997) (adopting former interpretation), <i>with Ashley v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775035\"><a href=\"/opinion/775035/billy-ray-ashley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">671</span></a></span>, 673 (7th Cir.2001) (adopting latter interpretation). Because the <i>Apprendi</i> rule does not have retroactive application, <i>see supra</i> Part II(A), we have no need to choose between these conflicting views.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Such an interpretation would lead to problematic results. Under it, a defendant whose conviction became final 364 days before the Supreme Court announced a new rule that fell outside the<i>Teague</i> exceptions would have a single day in which to file a habeas petition based on that rule, whereas an identically situated defendant whose conviction became final one day prior to the same announcement would have almost a full year to take advantage of the new rule. It confounds rational thinking to conclude that Congress intended a habeas petitioner's filing period to depend on so arbitrary a linkage.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Because our analysis disposes of the substance of the petitioner's claims, we need not address the government's other defenses (including, inter alia, whether the petitioner is procedurally barred from bringing his claims)</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
