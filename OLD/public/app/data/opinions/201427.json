Abigail Guzmán-Rosario (\"Guzmán\")\n\nsued United Parcel Service (\"UPS\") in the district court for\n\nviolations of Titles I and V of the Americans with Disabilities Act\n\nof 1990 (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12,101-12,213 (2000), and section 504\n\nof the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (2000).1        The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of UPS and Guzmán\n\nnow appeals.\n\n            The history can be briefly told.     In 1986, Guzmán began\n\npart-time work with UPS (four to five hours a day) at its package\n\nclearing center at its Muñiz Base facilities in Carolina, Puerto\n\nRico.    Her main work assignment was to scan (with a laser reader)\n\npackages moving down an assembly line and, where necessary, to\n\nreposition packages on the belt.        This required her to stand and\n\nmove around in the vicinity of the belt.\n\n            In November 1997, Guzmán felt pain in her left side and\n\nentered a hospital for a three-day stay.           She was eventually\n\ndiagnosed with ovarian cysts; this condition sometimes disappears\n\nin a few months without surgery.         To see if the cysts resolved\n\nthemselves and perhaps for other reasons, surgery was deferred for\n\n\n\n     1\n      Title I prohibits employers from discriminating against a\n\"qualified individual with a disability because of the disability,\"\n42 U.S.C. § 12,112(a); Title V pertinently prohibits discrimination\nagainst individuals who engage in certain acts protected under the\nADA, see 42 U.S.C. § 12,203(a). The counterpart provision of the\nRehabilitation Act is construed as congruent with Title I,\nOliveras-Sifre v. P.R. Dep't of Health, 214 F.3d 23, 25 n.2 (1st\nCir. 2000), and needs no separate treatment.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fabout eight months.   In the end, the cysts did not disappear; they\n\nwere surgically removed in July 1998, restoring Guzmán to health.\n\n           When she was hospitalized, Guzmán told her supervisor of\n\nher condition to excuse herself from work, which he permitted. Yet\n\nGuzmán thereafter suffered symptoms intermittently, including pain\n\nand occasional dizzy spells that required her to sit down or double\n\nover.   Occasionally her symptoms were severe enough to require her\n\nto remain at home lying down.    Partly on this account and partly\n\nbecause her son was repeatedly ill during this period and required\n\nhospital care, Guzmán was absent from work several times (in excess\n\nof her sick leave allowance) and was sometimes late to work.\n\n           In March 1998, Guzmán explained her condition to two\n\nsupervisors, providing them with medical documentation evidencing\n\nher condition, to justify her absences from work and her occasional\n\nsitting down.    Though one supervisor told Guzmán that \"it was\n\nokay\"; the other said that she had to resolve her condition because\n\nher absences and her sitting down while working were adversely\n\naffecting the company.    In May 1998, Guzmán received a warning\n\nletter from the division manager--later withdrawn as untimely under\n\nthe collective bargaining agreement--for lateness and absences\n\nduring the period January through April.   A second warning letter,\n\nrelating to one more lateness in June, was timely.\n\n           In July 1998, UPS conducted a monthly audit of telephone\n\nusage and the auditor reported to the division manager that Guzmán\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fhad been making excessive and unauthorized phone calls on company\n\ntime.   The division manager discharged Guzmán, treating the matter\n\nas a theft of time from the company (and so a listed ground for\n\ndischarge); the company had apparently fired other employees in\n\n1997 and 1998 on the same ground.          In a written declaration, the\n\ndivision manager described the unauthorized phone calls as the\n\nreason for Guzmán's discharge, although he separately described an\n\nunrelated incident of Guzmán's conduct that he believed improper.\n\n            In September 1999, about 13 months after her discharge,\n\nan arbitrator found that the termination was not justified under\n\nthe collective bargaining agreement because the company had not\n\nearlier described such calls as \"theft\" and the evidence against\n\nGuzmán was not strong.      The company filed a court appeal but then\n\nsettled, reinstating Guzmán and providing partial back pay for the\n\nperiod of her discharge.\n\n           Several    months   before     the   arbitration    award   issued,\n\nGuzmán filed an administrative charge of disability discrimination.\n\nIn January 2002, the relevant agency rejected her claim and issued\n\na right-to-sue letter.         Three months later, Guzmán brought the\n\npresent   action     in   federal   district     court.       Apart    from   an\n\nunsupported claim under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§\n\n2000e et seq. (2000), which Guzmán has now abandoned, the complaint\n\ncharged UPS under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act with failure to\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\faccommodate her alleged disability and retaliation against her for\n\nseeking an accommodation.\n\n               After discovery, UPS moved for summary judgment based on\n\nGuzmán's       deposition     and    other       documents.       Deeming   Guzmán's\n\nstatement of contested facts inadequate under the local Puerto Rico\n\nrule,2 the district court adopted UPS's statement of uncontested\n\nfacts.      See Corrada Betances v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc., 248 F.3d 40,\n\n43-44 (1st Cir. 2001).          The court then found that Guzmán had not\n\nbeen       disabled   prior   to     her   surgery,      had     not   requested   an\n\naccommodation, and had not been not subject to retaliation.                    This\n\nappeal followed.\n\n               Review of the grant of summary judgment is de novo. See,\n\ne.g., Gelabert-Ladenheim v. Am. Airlines, Inc., 252 F.3d 54, 58\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).         UPS's list of uncontested facts is accepted,\n\ngiven      Guzmán's   failure       properly      to   contest    them;   otherwise,\n\ninferences from the record are drawn in the light most favorable to\n\nGuzmán.       See United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Flores-Garcia, 318 F.3d\n\n323, 330 (1st Cir. 2003).            Here, the main issues turn on applying\n\nlegal tests to (mostly) known circumstances.\n\n               Where a worker is disabled an employer may not assume\n\nstereotypically an inability to work and (beyond this) must provide\n\n\n       2\n      A local district court rule, now D.P.R. Rule 56 and formerly\nD.P.R. Rule 311.12, requires that the statements of uncontested and\ncontested issues be specific and supported by record citations.\nGuzmán's statement comprised six conclusory statements with no\ncitations.\n\n                                           -5-\n\f\"reasonable accommodation\" unless undue hardship is shown.                            42\n\nU.S.C.    §     12,112(b)(5);       see    id.      §   12,112(a)-(b).       Having    a\n\n\"disability\" means having or being \"regarded as\" having a mental or\n\nphysical impairment that \"substantially limits one or more . . .\n\nmajor    life       activities.\"        Id.    §    12,102(2)(A),   (C).      We   have\n\nregularly consulted EEOC definitions of the terms, e.g., Wright v.\n\nCompUSA, Inc., 352 F.3d 472, 476 (1st Cir. 2003), but no agency has\n\nbeen granted authority to issue binding regulations interpreting\n\nthe term \"disability.\"            Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams,\n\n534 U.S. 184, 194 (2002).\n\n               Two different issues are presented as to Guzmán's claim\n\nthat she was disabled during the period in question.                           One is\n\nwhether       the    ovarian   cysts      were      sufficiently    long-lasting       a\n\ncondition to qualify as a \"disability\" rather than a temporary\n\naffliction;         the   other    is     whether,      duration    aside,   Guzmán's\n\ncondition impinged sufficiently on a \"major life activity\" to be\n\ntreated as disabling.             The district court ruled against Guzmán on\n\nboth counts.\n\n               Starting with the first of these issues, the ADA is not\n\na medical leave act nor a requirement of accommodation for common\n\nconditions that are short-term or can be promptly remedied.                         The\n\nSupreme Court stated in Toyota that in order to be \"substantially\n\nlimit[ing],\" an impairment must be \"permanent or long term.\"\n\nToyota, 534 U.S. at 198.             This may encompass conditions that are\n\n\n                                              -6-\n\f\"potentially long-term, in that their duration is indefinite and\n\nunknowable,\" Santiago Clemente v. Executive Airlines, Inc., 213\n\nF.3d 25, 31 (1st Cir. 2000) (internal quotation marks omitted), but\n\nnot those that are brief or foreseeably temporary, Carroll v. Xerox\n\nCorp., 294 F.3d 231, 240-41 (1st Cir. 2002) (three-month medical\n\nleave for chest pains), Soileau v. Guilford of Me., Inc., 105 F.3d\n\n12, 16 (1st Cir. 1997) (five-week leave from work and four-month\n\nactivity restriction because of a depressive attack).\n\n             Although Santiago Clemente suggested in dictum that an\n\nimpairment of whose duration \"is expected to be at least several\n\nmonths\" might qualify as a disability if severe enough, 213 F.3d at\n\n31,   this    was    before      Toyota's      \"permanent    or      long    term\"\n\npronouncement, and other cases may suggest that longer periods are\n\nrequired.     E.g., Carroll 294 F.3d at 240-41; Soileau, 105 F.3d at\n\n16.   Case law in other circuits is also uncertain.3                 The reasons\n\nfor the uncertainty are apparent.\n\n             The   statute    itself    says    nothing   about   duration     and\n\nnothing in the term “disability” or its definition gives a judge,\n\nand still less a jury, much guidance.             The problem is primarily a\n\npolicy choice to which Congress did not speak clearly; and the\n\nSupreme   Court     has   done   no    more    than   extrapolate,    from   some\n\n\n\n      3\n      See 1 Americans with Disabilities Act Handbook § 3.08, at 127\nn.453 (Henry H. Perritt, Jr. ed., 4th ed. 2003) (collecting cases);\nEmployment Discrimination Law 165-66 & nn.109-11 (C. Geoffrey\nWeirich ed., 3d ed. supp. 2002) (same).\n\n                                        -7-\n\festimated numbers of those to be covered, that severe restrictions\n\nof very important activities were what Congress had in mind.               See\n\nToyota, 534 U.S. at 197-98. Until the Supreme Court fine-tunes its\n\ninterpretation, it will be unclear how lower courts should deal\n\nwith periods between, say, 6 and 24 months.\n\n            In this case, Guzmán’s period of impairment falls within\n\nthis zone, very close to the shorter end.          That the impairment was\n\nnot severe lends some support to the district court’s resolution,\n\nas our case law suggests that shorter durations are tolerated only\n\nfor more severe impairments.        See, e.g., Santiago Clemente, 213\n\nF.3d at 31, Soileau, 105 F.3d at 15-16.      Still, we think it best to\n\nreserve the issue and rest our own affirmance on the district\n\ncourt’s second determination that Guzmán’s disability did not\n\n\"substantially\" limit a major life activity.\n\n            One major life activity relied on by Guzmán is \"working.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has expressed some doubt whether working can be\n\nso described.     See Sutton, v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471,\n\n492 (1999). The EEOC regulations by contrast assume that \"working\"\n\nis   a   major   life   activity.   They   state    that   a   plaintiff    is\n\n\"disabled\" even if she can still work but if she is significantly\n\nrestricted in or precluded from performing either a \"class\" of\n\njobs--a set of jobs utilizing similar skills, knowledge, and\n\ntraining to her prior job--or a \"broad range\" of jobs in various\n\nclasses--a large set of jobs that vary in what skills are required.\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fSee Gelabert, 252 F.3d at 60 (quoting 29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(j)(3)(ii)-\n\n(iii)).\n\n          Awaiting a definitive ruling from the Supreme Court\n\notherwise, we have assumed that \"working\" is a major life activity\n\nand applied the EEOC's framework in dismissing plaintiffs' ADA\n\nclaims, e.g., Sullivan v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc., 358 F.3d 110,\n\n115-16 (1st Cir. 2004).   So doing, we have required claimants to\n\nshow that they were precluded from more than the performance of a\n\nparticular job. See Carroll, 294 F.3d at 240; Lebron-Torres v.\n\nWhitehall Labs., 251 F.3d 236, 240 (1st Cir. 2001).       Guzmán's\n\nevidence of work difficulties--the occasional need to sit down and\n\nthe occasional inability to come to work because dizziness and pain\n\nrequired her to lie down–-showed at most difficulties in performing\n\nher one particular job at UPS.\n\n          Guzmán also claims as major life activities caring for\n\nher family, socializing, doing housework, and driving.   Here, too,\n\nthe law is unclear as to what counts;4 but in all events caring for\n\noneself commonly treated as a major life activity, e.g., Fraser v.\n\nGoodale, 342 F.3d 1032, 1038 (9th Cir. 2003); Fenney v. Dakota,\n\n\n     4\n      See, e.g. Felix v. N.Y. City Transit Auth., 324 F.3d 102, 106\n(2d Cir. 2003) (driving is not a major life activity); Sinkler v.\nMidwest Prop. Mgmt. Ltd. P'Ship, 209 F.3d 678, 685 (7th Cir. 2000)\n(not deciding whether driving is a major life activity); see also\nEEOC v. Sara Lee Corp., 237 F.3d 349, 353 (4th Cir. 2001)\n(considering claimant's ability to care for her son as indicative\nof her ability to care for herself); Krauel v. Iowa Methodist Med.\nCtr., 95 F.3d 674, 677 (8th Cir. 1996) (holding that \"caring for\nothers\" is not a major life activity).\n\n                                 -9-\n\fMinn. & E. R.R. Co., 327 F.3d 707, 714-15 (8th Cir. 2003).   In this\n\ncase, further refinements are not needed since Toyota requires that\n\nthe impairment \"prevent[] or severely limit[]\" the major life\n\nactivity.     534 U.S. at 198.    Guzman showed nothing more than\n\noccasional pain or dizziness; there is no evidence that these\n\nepisodes were so frequent as to significantly impinge on the\n\noverall performance of the above non-work activities, and the\n\nrecord shows that she could perform these tasks most of the time.\n\n            On appeal, Guzmán argues alternatively that she was\n\n\"regarded as\" disabled by UPS.      See 42 U.S.C. § 12,102(2)(C);\n\nSutton, 527 U.S. at 489.    However, Guzmán never presented to the\n\ndistrict court her argument that she was disabled because she was\n\n\"regarded as\" being unable to perform her work or any broader set\n\nof jobs.    Cf. Sheehan v. City of Gloucester, 321 F.3d 21, 24 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).     This forfeits this claim on appeal.     Campbell v.\n\nBankBoston, N.A., 327 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            Finally, Guzmán claims that UPS retaliated against her\n\nfor protected conduct, which is separate claim under the ADA, see\n\n42 U.S.C. § 12,203(a), and does not depend on the success of the\n\nplaintiff's disability claim. See Wright, 352 F.3d at 477-78. The\n\nclaim is usually made by one who requests an accommodation or\n\ncomplains about a refusal to accommodate and is then punished for\n\nthe request or the complaint.    See id.   But Guzmán never directly\n\nrequested an accommodation, and her only complaints–-to the agency\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fand then to the court--came after her discharge, so the discharge\n\nwas certainly not retaliation for them.\n\n                  Conceivably Guzmán might argue that by notifying her\n\nsupervisor of her condition she was implicitly requesting an\n\naccommodation. Even on this doubtful assumption,5 nothing suggests\n\nthat her superiors had any negative reaction to being informed of\n\nher condition or that her discharge was in any way a retaliation\n\nfor    this        disclosure,   see   Oliveras-Sifre,   214   F.3d   at   26,\n\nparticularly in light of the several-month delay between the\n\nnotification and her discharge.           Compare Williams v. Phila. Hous.\n\nAuth. Police Dep't, 380 F.3d 751, 760-61 (3d Cir. 2004), petition\n\nfor cert. filed, (U.S. Dec. 22, 2004) (No. 04-873), with Wright,\n\n352 F.3d at 478.\n\n                  This case is a useful reminder that the ADA is not a cure\n\nfor all work-affecting medical difficulties and, also, that some of\n\nthem       have    other   remedies.    Here,   the   collective   bargaining\n\nagreement appears to have done its work.              With reinstatement and\n\npartial back pay, Guzmán must be content.\n\n                  Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      See Estades-Negroni v. Assocs. Corp. of N. Am., 377 F.3d 58,\n64 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"Under the ADA, requests for accommodation must\nbe express and must be linked to a disability.\"); Reed v. LePage\nBakeries, Inc., 244 F.3d 254, 261 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"[T]he ADA's\nreasonable accommodation requirement usually does not apply unless\n'triggered by a request' . . . .\").\n\n                                        -11-\n\f",

In 1986, Guzm&#225;n began part-time work with UPS (four to five hours a day) at its package clearing center at its Mu&#241;iz Base facilities in Carolina, Puerto Rico. Her main work assignment was to scan (with a laser reader) packages moving down an assembly line and, where necessary, to reposition packages on the belt. This required her to stand and move around in the vicinity of the belt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1997, Guzm&#225;n felt pain in her left side and entered a hospital for a three-day stay. She was eventually diagnosed with ovarian cysts; this condition sometimes disappears in a few months without surgery. To see if the cysts resolved themselves and perhaps for other reasons, surgery was deferred for about eight months. In the end, the cysts did not disappear; they were surgically removed in July 1998, restoring Guzm&#225;n to health.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When she was hospitalized, Guzm&#225;n told her supervisor of her condition to excuse herself from work, which he permitted. Yet Guzm&#225;n thereafter suffered symptoms intermittently, including pain and occasional dizzy spells that required her to sit down or double over. Occasionally her symptoms were severe enough to require her to remain at home lying down. Partly on this account and partly because her son was repeatedly ill during this period and required hospital care, Guzm&#225;n was absent from work several times (in excess of her sick leave allowance) and was sometimes late to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1998, Guzm&#225;n explained her condition to two supervisors, providing them with medical documentation evidencing her condition, to justify her absences from work and her occasional sitting down. Though one supervisor told Guzm&#225;n that \"it was okay\"; the other said that she had to resolve her condition because her absences and her sitting down while working were adversely affecting the company. In May 1998, Guzm&#225;n received a warning letter from the division manager &#8212; later withdrawn as untimely under the collective bargaining agreement &#8212; for lateness and absences during the period January through April. A second warning letter, relating to one more lateness in June, was timely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1998, UPS conducted a monthly audit of telephone usage and the auditor reported to the division manager that Guzm&#225;n had been making excessive and unauthorized phone calls on company time. The division manager discharged Guzm&#225;n, treating the matter as a theft of time from the company (and so a listed ground for discharge); the company had apparently fired other employees in 1997 and 1998 on the same ground. In a written declaration, the division manager described the unauthorized phone calls as the reason for Guzm&#225;n's discharge, although he separately described an unrelated incident of Guzm&#225;n's conduct that he believed improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1999, about 13 months after her discharge, an arbitrator found that the termination was not justified under the collective bargaining agreement because the company had not earlier described such calls as \"theft\" and the evidence against Guzm&#225;n was not strong. The company filed a court appeal but then settled, reinstating Guzm&#225;n and providing partial back pay for the period of her discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several months before the arbitration award issued, Guzm&#225;n filed an administrative charge of disability discrimination. In January 2002, the relevant agency rejected her claim and issued a right-to-sue letter. Three months later, Guzm&#225;n brought the present action in federal district court. Apart from an unsupported claim under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e <i>et seq.</i> (2000), which Guzm&#225;n has now abandoned, the complaint charged UPS under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act with failure to accommodate her alleged disability and retaliation against her for seeking an accommodation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery, UPS moved for summary judgment based on Guzm&#225;n's deposition and other documents. Deeming Guzm&#225;n's statement of contested facts inadequate under the local Puerto Rico rule,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the district court adopted UPS's statement of uncontested facts. <i>See Corrada Betances v. Sea-Land Serv., Inc.,</i> 248 F.3d 40, 43-44 (1st Cir.2001). The court then found that Guzm&#225;n had not been disabled prior to her surgery, had not requested an accommodation, and had not been not subject to retaliation. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Review of the grant of summary judgment is <i>de novo. See, e.g., Gelabert-Ladenheim v. Am. Airlines, Inc.,</i> 252 F.3d 54, 58 (1st Cir.2001). UPS's list of uncontested facts is accepted, given Guzm&#225;n's failure properly to contest them; otherwise, inferences from the record are drawn in the light most favorable to Guzm&#225;n. <i>See United Parcel Serv., Inc. v. Flores-Galarza,</i> 318 F.3d 323, 330 (1st Cir.2003). Here, the main issues turn on applying legal tests to (mostly) known circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a worker is disabled an employer may not assume stereotypically an inability to work and (beyond this) must provide \"reasonable accommodation\" unless undue hardship is shown. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(b)(5); <i>see id.</i> &#167; 12112(a)-(b). Having a \"disability\" means having or being \"regarded as\" having a mental or physical impairment that \"substantially limits one or more ... major life activities.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 12102(2)(A), (C). We have regularly consulted EEOC definitions of the terms, <i>e.g., Wright v. CompUSA, Inc.,</i> 352 F.3d 472, 476 (1st Cir.2003), but no agency has been granted authority to issue binding regulations interpreting the term \"disability.\" <i>Toyota Motor Mfg., Ky., Inc. v. Williams,</i> 534 U.S. 184, 194, 122 S.Ct. 681, 151 L.Ed.2d 615 (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two different issues are presented as to Guzm&#225;n's claim that she was disabled during the period in question. One is whether the ovarian cysts were sufficiently long-lasting a condition to qualify as a \"disability\" rather than a temporary affliction; the other is whether, duration aside, Guzm&#225;n's condition impinged sufficiently on a \"major life activity\" to be treated as disabling. The district court ruled against Guzm&#225;n on both counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with the first of these issues, the ADA is not a medical leave act nor a requirement of accommodation for common conditions that are short-term or can be promptly remedied. The Supreme Court stated in <i>Toyota</i> that in order to be \"substantially limit[ing],\" an impairment must be \"permanent or long term.\" <i>Toyota,</i> 534 U.S. at 198, 122 S.Ct. 681. This may encompass conditions that are \"potentially long-term, in that their duration is indefinite and unknowable,\" <i>Santiago Clemente v. Executive Airlines, Inc.,</i> 213 F.3d 25, 31 (1st Cir.2000) (internal quotation marks omitted), but not those that are brief or foreseeably temporary, <i>Carroll v. Xerox Corp.,</i> 294 F.3d 231, 240-41 (1st Cir.2002) (three-month medical leave for chest pains), <i>Soileau v. Guilford of Me., Inc.,</i> 105 F.3d 12, 16 (1st Cir.1997) (five-week leave from work and four-month activity restriction because of a depressive attack).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although <i>Santiago Clemente</i> suggested in dictum that an impairment whose duration \"is expected to be at least several months\" might qualify as a disability if severe enough, 213 F.3d at 31, this was before <i>Toyota's</i>\"permanent or long term\" pronouncement, and other cases may suggest that longer periods are required. <i>E.g., Carroll</i> 294 F.3d at 240-41; <i>Soileau,</i> 105 F.3d at 16. Case law in other circuits is also uncertain.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The reasons for the uncertainty are apparent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute itself says nothing about duration and nothing in the term \"disability\" or its definition gives a judge, and still less a jury, much guidance. The problem is primarily a policy choice to which Congress did not speak clearly; and the Supreme Court has done no more than extrapolate, from some estimated numbers of those to be covered, that severe restrictions of very important activities were what Congress had in mind. <i>See Toyota,</i> 534 U.S. at 197-98, 122 S.Ct. 681. Until the Supreme Court fine-tunes its interpretation, it will be unclear how lower courts should deal with periods between, say, 6 and 24 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Guzm&#225;n's period of impairment falls within this zone, very close to the shorter end. That the impairment was not severe lends some support to the district court's resolution, as our case law suggests that shorter durations are tolerated only for more severe impairments. <i>See, e.g., Santiago Clemente,</i> 213 F.3d at 31; <i>Soileau,</i> 105 F.3d at 15-16. Still, we think it best to reserve the issue and rest our own affirmance on the district court's second determination that Guzm&#225;n's disability did not \"substantially\" limit a major life activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One major life activity relied on by Guzm&#225;n is \"working.\" The Supreme Court has expressed some doubt whether working can be so described. <i>See Sutton, v. United Air Lines, Inc.,</i> 527 U.S. 471, 492, 119 S.Ct. 2139, 144 L.Ed.2d 450 (1999). The EEOC regulations by contrast assume that \"working\" is a major life activity. They state that a plaintiff is \"disabled\" even if she can still work but if she is significantly restricted in or precluded from performing either a \"class\" of jobs &#8212; a set of jobs utilizing similar skills, knowledge, and training to her prior job &#8212; or a \"broad range\" of jobs in various classes &#8212; a large set of jobs that vary in what skills are required. <i>See Gelabert,</i> 252 F.3d at 60 (quoting 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(3)(ii)- (iii)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Awaiting a definitive ruling from the Supreme Court otherwise, we have assumed that \"working\" is a major life activity and applied the EEOC's framework in dismissing plaintiffs' ADA claims, <i>e.g., Sullivan v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc.,</i> 358 F.3d 110, 115-16 (1st Cir.2004). So doing, we have required claimants to show that they were precluded from more than the performance of a particular job. <i>See Carroll,</i> 294 F.3d at 240; <i>Lebron-Torres v. Whitehall Labs.,</i> 251 F.3d 236, 240 (1st Cir.2001). Guzm&#225;n's evidence of work difficulties &#8212; the occasional need to sit down and the occasional inability to come to work because dizziness and pain required her to lie down &#8212; showed at most difficulties in performing her one particular job at UPS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guzm&#225;n also claims as major life activities caring for her family, socializing, doing housework, and driving. Here, too, the law is unclear as to what counts;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> but in all events caring for oneself commonly treated as a major life activity, <i>e.g., Fraser v. Goodale,</i> 342 F.3d 1032, 1038 (9th Cir.2003); <i>Fenney v. Dakota, Minn. &amp; E. R.R. Co.,</i> 327 F.3d 707, 714-15 (8th Cir.2003). In this case, further refinements are not needed since <i>Toyota</i> requires that the impairment \"prevent[] or severely limit[]\" the major life activity. 534 U.S. at 198, 122 S.Ct. 681. Guzm&#225;n showed nothing more than occasional pain or dizziness; there is no evidence that these episodes were so frequent as to significantly impinge on the overall performance of the above non-work activities, and the record shows that she could perform these tasks most of the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Guzm&#225;n argues alternatively that she was \"regarded as\" disabled by UPS. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12,102(2)(C); <i>Sutton,</i> 527 U.S. at 489, 119 S.Ct. 2139. However, Guzm&#225;n never presented to the district court her argument that she was disabled because she was \"regarded as\" being unable to perform her work or any broader set of jobs. <i>Cf. Sheehan v. City of Gloucester,</i> 321 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir.2003). This forfeits this claim on appeal. <i>Campbell v. BankBoston, N.A.,</i> 327 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Guzm&#225;n claims that UPS retaliated against her for protected conduct, which is a separate claim under the ADA, <i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12,203(a), and does not depend on the success of the plaintiff's disability claim. <i>See Wright,</i> 352 F.3d at 477-78. The claim is usually made by one who requests an accommodation or complains about a refusal to accommodate and is then punished for the request or the complaint. <i>See id.</i> But Guzm&#225;n never directly requested an accommodation, and her only complaints &#8212; to the agency and then to the court &#8212; came <i>after</i> her discharge, so the discharge was certainly not retaliation for them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conceivably Guzm&#225;n might argue that by notifying her supervisor of her condition she was implicitly requesting an accommodation. Even on this doubtful assumption,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> nothing suggests that her superiors had any negative reaction to being informed of her condition or that her discharge was in any way a retaliation for this disclosure, <i>see Oliveras-Sifre,</i> 214 F.3d at 26, particularly in light of the several-month delay between the notification and her discharge. <i>Compare Williams v. Phila. Hous. Auth. Police Dep't,</i> 380 F.3d 751, 760-61 (3d Cir.2004), <i>petition for cert. filed,</i> (U.S. Dec. 22, 2004) (No. 04-873), <i>with Wright,</i> 352 F.3d at 478.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case is a useful reminder that the ADA is not a cure for all work-related difficulties and, also, that some of them have other remedies. Here, the collective bargaining agreement appears to have done its work. With reinstatement and partial back pay, Guzm&#225;n must be content.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Puerto Rico, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Title I prohibits employers from discriminating against a \"qualified individual with a disability because of the disability,\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12112(a); Title V pertinently prohibits discrimination against individuals who engage in certain acts protected under the ADA,<i>see</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12203(a).

Occasionally her symptoms were severe enough to require her to remain at home lying down. Partly on this account and partly because her son was repeatedly ill during this period and required hospital care, Guzm&#225;n was absent from work several times (in excess of her sick leave allowance) and was sometimes late to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1998, Guzm&#225;n explained her condition to two supervisors, providing them with medical documentation evidencing her condition, to justify her absences from work and her occasional sitting down. Though one supervisor told Guzm&#225;n that \"it was okay\"; the other said that she had to resolve her condition because her absences and her sitting down while working were adversely affecting the company. In May 1998, Guzm&#225;n received a warning letter from the division manager &#8212; later withdrawn as untimely under the collective bargaining agreement &#8212; for lateness and absences during the period January through April. A second warning letter, relating to one more lateness in June, was timely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1998, UPS conducted a monthly audit of telephone usage and the auditor reported to the division manager that Guzm&#225;n had been making excessive and unauthorized phone calls on company time. The division manager discharged Guzm&#225;n, treating the matter as a theft of time from the company (and so a listed ground for discharge); the company had apparently fired other employees in 1997 and 1998 on the same ground. In a written declaration, the division manager described the unauthorized phone calls as the reason for Guzm&#225;n's discharge, although he separately described an unrelated incident of Guzm&#225;n's conduct that he believed improper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1999, about 13 months after her discharge, an arbitrator found that the termination was not justified under the collective bargaining agreement because the company had not earlier described such calls as \"theft\" and the evidence against Guzm&#225;n was not strong. The company filed a court appeal but then settled, reinstating Guzm&#225;n and providing partial back pay for the period of her discharge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several months before the arbitration award issued, Guzm&#225;n filed an administrative charge of disability discrimination. In January 2002, the relevant agency rejected her claim and issued a right-to-sue letter. Three months later, Guzm&#225;n brought the present action in federal district court. Apart from an unsupported claim under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2000e <i>et seq.</i> (2000), which Guzm&#225;n has now abandoned, the complaint charged UPS under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act with failure to accommodate her alleged disability and retaliation against her for seeking an accommodation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After discovery, UPS moved for summary judgment based on Guzm&#225;n's deposition and other documents. Deeming Guzm&#225;n's statement of contested facts inadequate under the local Puerto Rico rule,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the district court adopted UPS's statement of uncontested facts. <i>See Corrada Betances v.

The court then found that Guzm&#225;n had not been disabled prior to her surgery, had not requested an accommodation, and had not been not subject to retaliation.

UPS's list of uncontested facts is accepted, given Guzm&#225;n's failure properly to contest them; otherwise, inferences from the record are drawn in the light most favorable to Guzm&#225;n. <i>See United Parcel Serv., Inc. v.

One is whether the ovarian cysts were sufficiently long-lasting a condition to qualify as a \"disability\" rather than a temporary affliction; the other is whether, duration aside, Guzm&#225;n's condition impinged sufficiently on a \"major life activity\" to be treated as disabling. The district court ruled against Guzm&#225;n on both counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Starting with the first of these issues, the ADA is not a medical leave act nor a requirement of accommodation for common conditions that are short-term or can be promptly remedied. The Supreme Court stated in <i>Toyota</i> that in order to be \"substantially limit[ing],\" an impairment must be \"permanent or long term.\" <i>Toyota,</i> 534 U.S. at 198, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118470\"><a href=\"/opinion/118470/toyota-motor-mfg-ky-inc-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Case law in other circuits is also uncertain.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The reasons for the uncertainty are apparent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The statute itself says nothing about duration and nothing in the term \"disability\" or its definition gives a judge, and still less a jury, much guidance. The problem is primarily a policy choice to which Congress did not speak clearly; and the Supreme Court has done no more than extrapolate, from some estimated numbers of those to be covered, that severe restrictions of very important activities were what Congress had in mind. <i>See Toyota,</i> 534 U.S. at 197-98, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118470\"><a href=\"/opinion/118470/toyota-motor-mfg-ky-inc-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Until the Supreme Court fine-tunes its interpretation, it will be unclear how lower courts should deal with periods between, say, 6 and 24 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, Guzm&#225;n's period of impairment falls within this zone, very close to the shorter end. That the impairment was not severe lends some support to the district court's resolution, as our case law suggests that shorter durations are tolerated only for more severe impairments. <i>See, e.g., Santiago Clemente,</i> 213 F.3d at 31; <i>Soileau,</i> 105 F.3d at 15-16. Still, we think it best to reserve the issue and rest our own affirmance on the district court's second determination that Guzm&#225;n's disability did not \"substantially\" limit a major life activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One major life activity relied on by Guzm&#225;n is \"working.\" The Supreme Court has expressed some doubt whether working can be so described. <i>See Sutton, v. United Air Lines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118311\"><a href=\"/opinion/118311/sutton-v-united-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">527</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, 492, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118311\"><a href=\"/opinion/118311/sutton-v-united-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

They state that a plaintiff is \"disabled\" even if she can still work but if she is significantly restricted in or precluded from performing either a \"class\" of jobs &#8212; a set of jobs utilizing similar skills, knowledge, and training to her prior job &#8212; or a \"broad range\" of jobs in various classes &#8212; a large set of jobs that vary in what skills are required. <i>See Gelabert,</i> 252 F.3d at 60 (quoting 29 C.F.R. &#167; 1630.2(j)(3)(ii)- (iii)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Awaiting a definitive ruling from the Supreme Court otherwise, we have assumed that \"working\" is a major life activity and applied the EEOC's framework in dismissing plaintiffs' ADA claims, <i>e.g., Sullivan v. Neiman Marcus Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200856\"><a href=\"/opinion/200856/sullivan-v-neiman-marcus/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">110</span></a></span>, 115-16 (1st Cir.2004). So doing, we have required claimants to show that they were precluded from more than the performance of a particular job. <i>See Carroll,</i> 294 F.3d at 240; <i>Lebron-Torres v. Whitehall Labs.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199418\"><a href=\"/opinion/199418/lebron-torres-v-white-hall-lab/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">236</span></a></span>, 240 (1st Cir.2001). Guzm&#225;n's evidence of work difficulties &#8212; the occasional need to sit down and the occasional inability to come to work because dizziness and pain required her to lie down &#8212; showed at most difficulties in performing her one particular job at UPS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guzm&#225;n also claims as major life activities caring for her family, socializing, doing housework, and driving. Here, too, the law is unclear as to what counts;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> but in all events caring for oneself commonly treated as a major life activity, <i>e.g., Fraser v.

In this case, further refinements are not needed since <i>Toyota</i> requires that the impairment \"prevent[] or severely limit[]\" the major life activity. 534 U.S. at 198, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118470\"><a href=\"/opinion/118470/toyota-motor-mfg-ky-inc-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Guzm&#225;n showed nothing more than occasional pain or dizziness; there is no evidence that these episodes were so frequent as to significantly impinge on the overall performance of the above non-work activities, and the record shows that she could perform these tasks most of the time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Guzm&#225;n argues alternatively that she was \"regarded as\" disabled by UPS. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 12,102(2)(C); <i>Sutton,</i> 527 U.S. at 489, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118311\"><a href=\"/opinion/118311/sutton-v-united-air-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The claim is usually made by one who requests an accommodation or complains about a refusal to accommodate and is then punished for the request or the complaint. <i>See id.</i> But Guzm&#225;n never directly requested an accommodation, and her only complaints &#8212; to the agency and then to the court &#8212; came <i>after</i> her discharge, so the discharge was certainly not retaliation for them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Conceivably Guzm&#225;n might argue that by notifying her supervisor of her condition she was implicitly requesting an accommodation.
