Byrne, with whom the Federal Defender Office was\non brief, for appellant.\n     John M. Hodgens, Jr., Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, and Virginia M.\nVander Jagt, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                        January 27, 2004\n\f             LYNCH, Circuit Judge.       Lennell York, Jr. pled guilty to\n\nmailing a threatening letter to his estranged common-law spouse in\n\nviolation of 18 U.S.C. § 876.                In September 2002, York was\n\nsentenced to 41 months in prison, to be followed by three years of\n\nsupervised     release.    As   part    of   his    supervised    release,    the\n\ndistrict court required York to participate in a sex offender\n\ntreatment program and to submit to periodic polygraph testing as a\n\nmeans to ensure his participation in that program.\n\n             On appeal, York attacks these two conditions, neither of\n\nwhich will take effect until he begins his supervised release\n\nprogram upon his release from prison in early 2006.              We construe an\n\nambiguous provision in the supervised release order to minimize the\n\nrisk to York of coercive self-incrimination in violation of his\n\nFifth Amendment rights, and we affirm the judgment as construed.\n\n                                       I.\n\n             Though this is solely a sentencing appeal, the facts of\n\nYork's underlying offense and criminal history are pertinent to the\n\ndistrict court's choice of supervised release conditions.               This is\n\nso by statute.     Under 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d), the district court may\n\nimpose   any    special   condition     of   supervised    release     that    it\n\nconsiders \"appropriate,\" provided that the condition satisfies\n\ncertain specified     criteria.        One   such    criterion    is   that   the\n\ncondition imposed be \"reasonably related to the factors set forth\n\nin section 3553(a)(1).\"      Id. § 3583(d)(1).        Section 3553(a)(1), in\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fturn, requires the court to consider \"the nature and circumstances\n\nof   the   offense    and    the    history     and   characteristics       of    the\n\ndefendant.\"    See also U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(b).              In this case, the facts\n\nare drawn from the pre-sentence report, as amended to reflect\n\nYork's minor objections, and from the transcript of the sentencing\n\nhearing.     See United States v. Lopez, 299 F.3d 84, 86 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).\n\n            In July 2000, York was an inmate in a Massachusetts house\n\nof   corrections,    where    he    was    serving    a    sentence   for   a    1999\n\nconviction    for    sexually      assaulting    a    girl    under   the   age    of\n\nfourteen.     On July 2, York mailed a letter to A.S., his estranged\n\ncommon-law wife and a relative of the girl whom he had assaulted.\n\nIn the letter, York wrote:          \"I can not and will not let you live.\n\nI make this statement knowing full well what the consequences are.\n\n. . .    You will be dead, and I will be in jail.              You may take this\n\nas an idle threat if you choose to, but I will find and exterminate\n\nyou.     You will cease to exist.\"          He signed the letter \"L. York.\"\n\n             A.S. reported the letter to the authorities, and on July\n\n13, the FBI visited York in jail.               He agreed to be interviewed,\n\nsigned a waiver of his Miranda rights, and admitted that he had\n\nsent the letter.      His lawyer later explained that York decided to\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fwrite the letter when he learned that A.S. was planning to move\n\naway and take their children with her.1\n\n            A federal criminal complaint was filed against York in\n\nthe District of Massachusetts in February 2002, and York was\n\nordered detained pending indictment and trial.         In April 2002, the\n\ngovernment formally charged York with violating 18 U.S.C. § 876,\n\nwhich makes it a crime to send via the U.S. Postal Service any\n\n\"communication . . . addressed to any other person and containing\n\n. . . any threat to injure the person of the addressee.\"            § 876(c).\n\nOn May 13, 2002, York pled guilty to the charge.\n\n            At the sentencing hearing in September 2002, the district\n\ncourt determined, and the parties agreed, that York's criminal\n\nhistory    qualified   him   as   a   \"career   offender\"   under   U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 4B1.1.     Among York's prior offenses were two convictions in\n\nMassachusetts state court for indecent assaults upon minors.              In\n\nthe first incident, which occurred in 1993, York bought alcohol for\n\na minor girl who was over the age of fourteen and then subjected\n\nher to an indecent assault and battery. The second incident, which\n\noccurred in 1999, was York's sexual assault on the girl related to\n\nA.S.\n\n            In light of York's criminal history and the dictates of\n\nthe career offender guideline, the district court determined that\n\n\n       1\n       In July 2001, following his release from state prison and\nbefore his arrest for mailing the letter, York visited A.S. without\nincident.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe applicable guidelines range was 37 to 46 months.   York sought\n\na downward departure on the basis of diminished capacity, see\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5K2.13, which the court denied on the ground that\n\n§ 5K2.13 does not permit departures where the defendant's conduct\n\ninvolved \"a serious threat of violence.\"      Id.   The court then\n\nadded:\n\n     I also agree with the government that . . . this\n     particular defendant's criminal history indicates a need\n     to incarcerate him to protect the public. He has shown\n     himself capable of committing, not one, but two very\n     dastardly and heinous sexual crimes against defenseless\n     young women . . . .\n\nThe court warned York that he would spend the rest of his life in\n\nprison if he were ever arrested again for committing a violent\n\ncrime, \"particularly a crime against people who are defenseless.\"\n\nYork was sentenced to 41 months in prison plus a three-year term of\n\nsupervised release.\n\n          In addition to the standard conditions of supervised\n\nrelease, see U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(c), the court imposed on York several\n\nspecial conditions:\n\n     The defendant is to participate in a sex offender\n     specific treatment program at the direction of the\n     Probation Office.   The defendant shall be required to\n     submit to periodic polygraph testing as a means to insure\n     that he is in compliance with the requirements of his\n     therapeutic program. No violation proceedings will arise\n     based solely on a defendant's failure to \"pass\" the\n     polygraph.   Such an event could, however, generate a\n     separate investigation. When submitting to a polygraph\n\n\n\n\n                               -5-\n\f     exam, the defendant does not give up his Fifth Amendment\n     rights.2\n\nThe government had not asked the court to impose these conditions\n\non York, nor had the Probation Office recommended them in York's\n\npre-sentence report (PSR).3     Defense counsel, however, did not\n\nobject when the court listed them among the conditions it was\n\nimposing.\n\n            Several months after the sentencing hearing, York filed\n\na motion to modify the sex offender treatment and polygraph testing\n\nconditions.    The district court denied the motion because York had\n\nalready filed a notice of appeal to this court raising the same\n\nissues.   York's motion to reconsider that denial was denied on the\n\nsame ground.    Cf. United States v. Distasio, 820 F.2d 20, 23 (1st\n\nCir. 1987) (pending notice of appeal deprives the district court of\n\njurisdiction over the substance of the appeal).4\n\n\n     2\n       The court further prohibited York from possessing a firearm\nor other dangerous weapon, ordered him to participate in a drug\ntesting program as well as a mental health program, barred him from\nconsuming any alcoholic beverages, and prohibited him from\nidentifying himself by anything other than his true name. York\ndoes not challenge these special conditions on appeal.\n     3\n      The government had sought only two of the special conditions\nof supervised release that the court imposed on York:          the\nprohibition on possessing weapons and the requirement that York\nattend a mental health treatment program. York consented to those\nconditions.\n     4\n       The district court did not require York to submit to\ncompulsory registration as a sex offender, only to participate in\na treatment program for sex offenders. This court has elsewhere\nrecognized that \"requiring registration as a sex offender is\ndifferent, in type and kind, from any of the usual conditions\n\n                                 -6-\n\f                                  II.\n\n           York attacks the conditions of his supervised release on\n\nmultiple grounds.    He argues (1) that the district court could not\n\nrequire him to attend a sex offender treatment program as a\n\ncondition of supervised release because his § 876 conviction did\n\nnot involve a sex-related offense; and (2) that the mandatory\n\npolygraph testing condition is invalid because (i) it will compel\n\nhim to incriminate himself in violation of his Fifth Amendment\n\nrights; (ii) it constitutes an impermissible delegation of the\n\njudicial function to non-judicial officers; and (iii) it is an\n\ninherently unreliable and thus unreasonable means of ensuring\n\ncompliance with supervised release conditions.        We address each of\n\nthese contentions in turn, saving for last the more troublesome\n\nissues raised by York's Fifth Amendment challenge.\n\nA. Standard of Review\n\n           The   parties   disagree   on   the   applicable   standard   of\n\nreview.   This court ordinarily reviews challenges to conditions of\n\nsupervised release for abuse of discretion, but if the issue is\n\nforfeited, review is for plain error only.             United States v.\n\nMansur-Ramos, 348 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir. 2003).            The government\n\nargues that York forfeited his objections to the conditions of his\n\nsupervised release by failing to raise them during the sentencing\n\n\nattached to supervised release.\" United States v. Brown, 235 F.3d\n2, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2000).    No issue of registration is presented\nhere.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fhearing.     We have accepted this argument elsewhere.               See, e.g.,\n\nid.; United States v. Brown, 235 F.3d 2, 3-4 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n             York   acknowledges     that   he   failed     to   object   below.\n\nNevertheless, he argues that a contemporaneous objection was not\n\nrequired because, given that the conduct for which he was convicted\n\nwas unrelated to sex, and given that neither the government nor the\n\nPSR proposed sex offender treatment or polygraph testing, he could\n\nnot reasonably have anticipated the special conditions imposed by\n\nthe court.    We are doubtful.      Considering York's history of sexual\n\noffenses and violence against women, it should not have been\n\ndifficult to predict the court's interest in such conditions.\n\n             In any event, we need not decide which of these arguments\n\nshould prevail, for our conclusion in York's case is the same under\n\neither standard of review.         But there is a serious consequence to\n\nthe belatedness of York's attack.            As the government correctly\n\npoints out, there is no factual record developed as to the specific\n\nsex offender treatment program that York will be required to\n\nattend, the types of polygraph exams that may be administered, or\n\neven the questions that York will likely be required to answer.\n\nWhile the relevant treatment programs or polygraph technology may\n\nbe somewhat different in 2006, information as to existing programs\n\nand polygraph       exams   is   surely   available   and    would   have   been\n\nhelpful.     A timely objection and the creation of a record would\n\n\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fhave permitted both the district court and this court to review\n\nYork's claims with the benefit of that information.\n\nB.   Sex Offender Treatment Requirement\n\n                York argues that because his conviction was for mailing\n\na threatening communication, not for a sex-related crime, the\n\nrequirement that he participate in a sex offender treatment program\n\nimposes a \"greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably\n\nnecessary\"      to    deter    criminal          conduct     or    protect     the   public.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(b).           York misunderstands the law.\n\n               The Sentencing Guidelines do not limit district courts to\n\nconsideration only of the facts of the crime charged. A sentencing\n\ncourt should consider each defendant's history, regardless of the\n\nnature of the crime of conviction.                  The judge has the authority to\n\nimpose any condition of supervised release that is reasonably\n\nrelated        to     (1)     the        defendant's       offense,        history,       and\n\ncharacteristics; (2) the need to deter the defendant from further\n\ncriminal conduct; (3) the need to protect the public from further\n\ncrimes    by    the    defendant;         and    (4)   the    effective        educational,\n\nvocational,         medical,    or       other    correctional          treatment    of   the\n\ndefendant.            U.S.S.G.       §     5D1.3(b)(1);           see   also    18   U.S.C.\n\n§ 3583(d)(1); Mansur-Ramos, 348 F.3d at 33; United States v. Peppe,\n\n80 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir. 1996).                        Although these factors are\n\nconnected by the word \"and,\" see § 3583(d)(1); § 5D1.3(b)(1), \"the\n\ncritical test is whether the challenged condition is sufficiently\n\n\n                                             -9-\n\frelated to one or more of the permissible goals of supervised\n\nrelease.\"   Brown, 235 F.3d at 6 (emphasis added); see also United\n\nStates v. Barajas, 331 F.3d 1141, 1146-47 (10th Cir. 2003) (noting\n\nthat every circuit to have decided the issue has adopted this\n\ninterpretation notwithstanding the \"and\" conjunction). So the fact\n\nthat a condition of supervised release is not directly related to\n\nYork's crime of conviction does not render that condition per se\n\ninvalid.\n\n            York acknowledges these principles but argues that sex\n\noffender treatment is uniquely reserved for cases involving sex\n\noffenses. He points to U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(d)(7), which provides that\n\na special condition requiring the defendant's participation in a\n\nsex-offender treatment program should be imposed \"if the instant\n\noffense of conviction is a sex offense.\"        But this is little aid to\n\nYork, as the Guidelines conspicuously do not say that sex-offender\n\ntreatment is appropriate only if the underlying crime was a sex\n\noffense.    In fact, the preamble to § 5D1.3(d) provides that the\n\nspecial conditions listed therein, including participation in a\n\nprogram for sex offenders, \"are recommended in the circumstances\n\ndescribed   and,   in   addition,   may    otherwise   be   appropriate   in\n\nparticular cases.\" (emphasis added).         And nothing in the statute\n\nunderlying § 5D1.3 limits the special condition of sex-offender\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\ftreatment to defendants under prosecution for sex crimes.5          See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3583.\n\n           There are, however, several limitations on a district\n\ncourt's power to fashion special conditions of supervised release.\n\nWe list a few.    First, a special condition must in fact be tailored\n\nto the circumstances:      it can involve \"no greater deprivation of\n\nliberty than is reasonably necessary\" to achieve the purposes of\n\nsupervised release. U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(b)(2). Second, the condition\n\nimposed must be consistent with any pertinent policy statements\n\nfrom the Sentencing Commission.       Id.    Finally, the trial court's\n\ndecision to impose the challenged condition must have adequate\n\nevidentiary support in the record.         Brown, 235 F.3d at 6; United\n\nStates v. Thurlow, 44 F.3d 46, 46 n.3 (1st Cir. 1995) (per curiam).\n\n           Given York's criminal history and in light of the record\n\nin this case, which includes a threat of violence by York against\n\nyet   another    woman,   the   district   court   was   well   within   its\n\ndiscretion in requiring York to participate in the sex offender\n\n\n      5\n       York relies on United States v. Scott, 270 F.3d 632 (8th\nCir. 2001), in which the Eighth Circuit held that it was an abuse\nof discretion to require sex-offender treatment as a condition of\nsupervised release for a defendant whose offense of conviction was\narmed bank robbery.    See id. at 636.     But in Scott, the only\nevidence of sexual misconduct by the defendant was a single\nconviction over fifteen years old. The court concluded that sex-\noffender treatment was unnecessary because the defendant's sex-\nrelated misconduct had ceased.     Id.   York, by contrast, is a\nrecidivist sex offender who was convicted of a sex crime only three\nyears prior to the sentencing hearing.\n     In any event, to the extent Scott conflicts with our\nreasoning, we decline to follow it.\n\n                                   -11-\n\ftreatment program.        The condition that he attend sex-offender\n\ntreatment is plainly related to his criminal history:                 York has\n\ntwice been convicted for sexually assaulting young girls, including\n\none conviction only a year before he mailed his threatening letter\n\nto A.S.    See United States v. Peterson, 248 F.3d 79, 84 (2d Cir.\n\n2001)    (approving   a   special   release   condition     of   sex-offender\n\ntreatment for a defendant convicted of bank larceny where the\n\ndefendant had been convicted of a sex offense in state court five\n\nyears earlier).\n\n            York's proven recidivism, moreover, makes the condition\n\nreasonably related to another permissible purpose of supervised\n\nrelease:     protecting     the   public   from   further    crimes    by   the\n\ndefendant.    In McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24 (2002), the Supreme\n\nCourt observed that convicted sex offenders who reenter society are\n\n\"much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested\n\nfor a new rape or sexual assault.\"            Id. at 33.         Furthermore,\n\ntreatment programs of the kind the district court has required York\n\nto attend may \"enable sex offenders to manage their impulses and in\n\nthis way reduce recidivism.\"         Id.   The district court's remarks\n\nduring sentencing make clear that the court believed that York\n\nneeded such treatment and that he continued to pose a risk to young\n\ngirls.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\f           The    district   court    committed   no   error,   plain   or\n\notherwise, in requiring York to participate in a sex-offender\n\ntreatment program as a condition of his supervised release.\n\nC.   Mandatory Polygraph Testing\n\n           More serious is York's Fifth Amendment challenge to the\n\nmandatory polygraph testing requirement in his supervised release\n\nconditions.     We turn to that question after addressing York's two\n\nthreshold objections to the polygraph testing condition.\n\n           1.    Impermissible delegation\n\n           York contends that the polygraph testing requirement, as\n\nworded in the district court's order, unlawfully delegates to non-\n\njudicial officers the power to determine matters of punishment. He\n\nargues that the district court's command that he \"shall be required\n\nto submit to periodic polygraph testing as a means to insure that\n\nhe is in compliance with the requirements of his therapeutic\n\nprogram\" is vague as to the frequency, duration, and allowable\n\nscope of the questioning.      By failing to specify these details,\n\nYork claims, the district court impermissibly assigned to the\n\nProbation Office the power to determine the nature and extent of\n\nhis punishment.\n\n           The district court committed no error in allowing York's\n\nprobation officers to determine these details.         Federal courts are\n\nnot prohibited from \"using nonjudicial officers to support judicial\n\nfunctions, as long as th[e] judicial officer retains and exercises\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fultimate responsibility.\"       United States v. Allen, 312 F.3d 512,\n\n515-16 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal quotation marks omitted).       Here,\n\nthe district court left no significant penological decision to the\n\ndiscretion of the Probation Office:       the court itself determined\n\nthat York \"is to participate\" in a treatment program for sex\n\noffenders and that York \"shall be required\" to submit to polygraph\n\ntesting to confirm his compliance with his treatment regimen. This\n\ndistinguishes York's case from our recent decision in United States\n\nv. Melendez-Santana, Nos. 01-2386 & 01-2397, 2003 WL 23008812 (1st\n\nCir. Dec. 24, 2003).      In Melendez-Santana, this court upheld a\n\ndelegation challenge to a special condition of supervised release\n\nbecause the district court had authorized the defendant's probation\n\nofficer to determine not only the details of the defendant's drug\n\ntreatment, but also whether the defendant would be required to\n\nundergo such treatment.    Id. at *7; see also Peterson, 248 F.3d at\n\n84-85; United States v. Kent, 209 F.3d 1073, 1079 (8th Cir. 2000).\n\nIn this case, the district court made all such decisions itself.\n\n           Further, contrary to York's assertion, the district court\n\ndid restrict the scope of permissible questioning: the polygraph\n\ntesting is \"a means to [e]nsure that [York] is in compliance with\n\nthe   requirements   of   his   therapeutic   program.\"   This   is    a\n\npermissibly narrow delegation of administrative details.              See\n\nMelendez-Santana, 2003 WL 23008812, at *7 n.6 (the question of\n\nwhich drug program a defendant must attend, and when he may be\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fdischarged, involves \"administrative details\" properly delegated to\n\na   probation   officer);    Allen,      312   F.3d   at    516.    Indeed,   the\n\ndelegation here is narrower than the one that this court upheld in\n\nAllen as acceptable reliance on probation officers' administrative\n\nexpertise.6      See   312   F.3d   at    515-16      (upholding    a   condition\n\nrequiring the defendant to participate in mental health treatment\n\n\"as directed by the probation officer, until such time as the\n\ndefendant is released from the program by the probation officer\").\n\n           York's reliance on United States v. Merric, 166 F.3d 406\n\n(1st Cir. 1999), is misplaced.           In Merric, this court vacated the\n\ndefendant's     sentence     because     the    trial      court   impermissibly\n\ndelegated to a probation officer the power to set the defendant's\n\nfine payment schedule.       See id. at 408-09.         If a probation officer\n\ncannot set a fine payment schedule, York argues, a schedule of\n\n\n      6\n       Delegations to probation officers may be less likely to be\nproblematic than those involving other officials because probation\nofficers, while not judicial officers, are statutorily bound to\nserve \"within the jurisdiction and under the direction\" of the\nappointing court. 18 U.S.C. § 3602(a). They function as an \"arm\nof the court,\" United States v. Saxena, 229 F.3d 1, 5 n.1 (1st Cir.\n2000), and the Sentencing Guidelines themselves entrust many\ncorrectional decisions to their discretion, see, e.g., U.S.S.G.\n§ 5D1.3(d)(7) (recommending that sex offenders participate in a\ntreatment program \"approved by the United States Probation\nOffice\"). As a practical matter, moreover, many district courts\nmust rely on probation services to ensure the efficient\nadministration of justice in criminal cases. See United States v.\nBernardine, 237 F.3d 1279, 1283 (11th Cir. 2001). For this reason,\nat least one court of appeals has suggested that delegations like\nthe one in this case are permissible in part because of the unique\nrelationship between probation officers and the district courts.\nSee United States v. Taylor, 338 F.3d 1280, 1284 (11th Cir. 2003);\nUnited States v. Zinn, 321 F.3d 1084, 1092 (11th Cir. 2003).\n\n                                       -15-\n\fpolygraph sessions should be equally off-limits.                The analogy is\n\nnot persuasive.         Merric simply held that \"it is the inherent\n\nresponsibility of the judge to determine matters of punishment and\n\nthis includes final authority over all payment matters.\"                Id. at\n\n409.   But the schedule of installment payments for a fine or\n\nrestitution order has a far more material impact on a defendant\n\nthan the timing of intermittent polygraph examinations.                Setting\n\nthe former may be a \"core judicial function,\" United States v.\n\nMiller, 77 F.3d 71, 78 (4th Cir. 1996) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted),   but    scheduling     the   latter    is   surely    a   matter   of\n\nadministrative detail. Here, the court provided that the polygraph\n\ntesting shall be \"periodic,\" and that the purpose of the testing\n\nshall be to determine whether York is cooperating with his therapy.\n\nFurther detail from the court was not required.           Cf. United States\n\nv. Fellows, 157 F.3d 1197, 1204 (9th Cir. 1998) (observing that a\n\nsentencing court \"cannot be expected to design and implement the\n\nparticularities of a treatment program\").\n\n            2.    Inherent unreliability\n\n            York next asserts that the polygraph requirement is\n\nunreasonable,     and    thus   invalid,   because     polygraph     tests    are\n\ninherently unreliable and cannot measure whether he is in fact\n\ncomplying with his treatment program.            York points to the Supreme\n\nCourt's acknowledgment that \"there is simply no consensus that\n\npolygraph evidence is reliable.\"           United States v. Scheffer, 523\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fU.S. 303, 309 (1998).    In response, the United States does not deny\n\nthat polygraph technology is of doubtful reliability, but it\n\nasserts that the polygraph is nevertheless a useful tool for\n\npolicing defendants'     compliance   with   conditions   of   supervised\n\nrelease. Regardless of the device's actual ability to detect lies,\n\nthe government suggests, the polygraph provides an incentive for\n\nYork to pursue his treatment program honestly because he may\n\nbelieve that if he lies about his progress, the polygraph will\n\nexpose him.    At least one court of appeals has endorsed this view.\n\nSee United States v. Taylor, 338 F.3d 1280, 1284 n.2 (11th Cir.\n\n2003) (polygraph testing is useful in promoting the treatment of\n\nsex offenders because \"probationers fear that any false denials of\n\nviolations will be detected\"); see also United States v. Lee, 315\n\nF.3d 206, 217 (3d Cir. 2003) (polygraph testing can be \"beneficial\n\nin enhancing the supervision and treatment\" of a sex offender).\n\n            The record in this case provides no factual foundation on\n\nwhich to evaluate these arguments. The court imposed the polygraph\n\ncondition sua sponte; neither side submitted evidence on the\n\nusefulness or reliability of polygraph exams.             This leaves a\n\ndifficult empirical problem that appellate courts are not well\n\nsuited to resolve.     Perhaps polygraph technology has become more\n\nreliable in the five years since the Supreme Court's decision in\n\nScheffer.     Or perhaps it will be more reliable when York actually\n\nbegins his supervised release in 2006. Or perhaps the whole theory\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fof polygraph examinations is irredeemably flawed.         Cf. Scheffer,\n\n523 U.S. at 310 (citing studies challenging the scientific basis\n\nfor polygraph tests).     Those questions are unanswerable on this\n\nrecord.\n\n           Similarly, we cannot accept on faith that polygraphs are\n\neffective at deterring lies, irrespective of their accuracy.          The\n\ndeterrent effect of polygraph testing, after all, is related to the\n\nreliability question:    York will only be deterred from lying if he\n\nbelieves that a polygraph will likely expose his lies.          Perhaps\n\npolygraphs, while imperfect, are reliable enough to achieve this\n\ndeterrent effect.   Perhaps they will be so reliable in 2006.         The\n\nrecord provides no basis on which to make such a determination.\n\n           For these reasons, we decline to issue a blanket decision\n\non the propriety of polygraph testing as a tool of supervised\n\nrelease.     To the extent York fears that a false positive on a\n\npolygraph exam will automatically result in the revocation of his\n\nsupervised    release,   the   district   court   has   anticipated   and\n\naddressed his concerns.        According to the court's order, \"[n]o\n\nviolation proceedings will arise based solely on [the] defendant's\n\nfailure to 'pass' the polygraph.\"     Given this prophylaxis, the use\n\nof a polygraph to promote York's rehabilitation is not per se\n\nunreasonable.     If, after his supervised release begins, York\n\nbelieves that he has been prejudiced by the unreliability of a\n\npolygraph test (or by the burdensomeness of the polygraph regime as\n\n\n                                  -18-\n\fadministered by the Probation Office), he is free to marshal\n\nsupporting scientific evidence and petition the district court to\n\nmodify the conditions of his supervised release.       See 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3583(e)(2).    Until that time, any specific claim of prejudice is\n\npremature.\n\n           3.    Fifth Amendment claim\n\n           York's most potent challenge to the mandatory polygraph\n\nrequirement is that it violates his Fifth Amendment privilege\n\nagainst self-incrimination.     York contends that in the course of\n\nhis treatment program he will inevitably be asked incriminating\n\nquestions, and that he will be compelled to answer due to the\n\nsevere consequences to him of revocation:       because his criminal\n\nhistory category is VI, York would face a minimum of eight months\n\nin prison if his supervised release were revoked.       See U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 7B1.4.\n\n             In response, the United States does not dispute that the\n\nFifth Amendment applies in interviews with probation officers,\n\nregardless of whether a polygraph is involved.      See Minnesota v.\n\nMurphy, 465 U.S. 420, 426 (1984).        Instead, it argues that the\n\nmandatory polygraph condition does not on its face \"compel\" York to\n\ngive incriminating answers.     Cf. United States v. Washington, 431\n\nU.S. 181, 188 (1977) (\"[The] constitutional guarantee is only that\n\nthe witness be not compelled to give self-incriminating testimony.\"\n\n(emphasis added)).\n\n\n                                 -19-\n\f            We begin with first principles.         Nothing in the Fifth\n\nAmendment mitigates the general obligation on probationers to\n\nappear and answer questions truthfully.          See Murphy, 465 U.S. at\n\n427.    Probation   officers    may    demand   honest   answers   to   their\n\nquestions, just as prosecutors may demand truthful answers from\n\ngrand jury witnesses subpoenaed to testify.              See id.   Further,\n\nbecause revocation proceedings are not criminal proceedings, York\n\nwill not be entitled to refuse to answer questions solely on the\n\nground that his replies may lead to revocation of his supervised\n\nrelease.    Id. at 435 n.7.    York's probation officers, by requiring\n\nhim to answer such questions, will not \"compel\" him to incriminate\n\nhimself within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment.          See id. at 427-\n\n28, 435 n.7.    Of course, York will have a valid Fifth Amendment\n\nclaim if his probation officers ask, and compel him to answer over\n\nhis assertion of privilege, a particular question implicating him\n\nin \"a crime other than that for which he has been convicted.\"             Id.\n\nat 426. But York cannot mount a generalized Fifth Amendment attack\n\non the conditions of his supervised release on the ground that he\n\nwill   be   required   to     answer    probation   officers'      questions\n\ntruthfully.\n\n            The question, then, is whether the requirement that York\n\nsubmit to polygraph tests during these interviews alters the\n\nconstitutional analysis.       The government says that it does not,\n\narguing that the polygraph merely enforces the general obligation\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fon probationers to answer questions concerning their probationary\n\nstatus   truthfully.         In   the   government's     view,    the   polygraph\n\nrequirement adds nothing relevant to the Fifth Amendment analysis:\n\nYork   might     have   valid     claims   of    privilege   as   to    particular\n\nquestions, but the mandatory polygraph condition on its face does\n\nnot implicate York's Fifth Amendment rights.\n\n            In fact, the polygraph requirement may implicate York's\n\nFifth Amendment rights, depending on how the district court's order\n\nis understood.      One reading of the release condition is that it\n\nflatly requires York to submit to polygraph testing as a condition\n\nof his supervised release, so that York's refusal to answer any\n\nquestion    --   even   on   valid      Fifth    Amendment   grounds     –-   could\n\nconstitute a basis for revocation.              If that reading were intended,\n\nit would be constitutionally problematic.               The Supreme Court has\n\nreasoned:\n\n       [I]f the state, either expressly or by implication,\n       asserts that invocation of the privilege would lead to\n       revocation of probation, it would have created the\n       classic penalty situation, the failure to assert the\n       privilege would be excused, and the probationer's answers\n       would be deemed compelled and inadmissible in a criminal\n       prosecution.\n\nMurphy, 465 U.S. at 435.\n\n            Sensitive to Fifth Amendment issues, the district court\n\ninserted a caveat in its order:            \"When submitting to a polygraph\n\nexam, the defendant does not give up his Fifth Amendment rights.\"\n\nThe government argues that this qualification obviates any concern\n\n\n                                        -21-\n\fthat   the    polygraph       requirement      on    its    face   compels     York   to\n\nincriminate himself.           It might well have been intended to do so,\n\nbut the qualification is ambiguous.                   The court stated only that\n\nYork \"does not give up his Fifth Amendment rights\" in submitting to\n\npolygraph testing.            That could mean (1) that York's supervised\n\nrelease     will   not   be    revoked       based    on    his   refusal    to   answer\n\npolygraph questions on valid Fifth Amendment grounds; (2) that York\n\nmust answer every question during his polygraph exams on pain of\n\nrevocation, but that his answers will not be used against him in\n\nany future prosecution; or simply (3) that York will be entitled,\n\nin any future prosecution, to seek exclusion of his answers on the\n\ngrounds that the polygraph procedure forced him to incriminate\n\nhimself.      York objects to the second interpretation because he\n\nfears that it is ultra vires:                      the district court, he says,\n\nprobably     lacks     the    power   to     grant    him    immunity    from     future\n\nprosecutions, state or federal, based on information that he may\n\nreveal to his probation officers.                   And the third interpretation\n\noffers him no assurances at all.\n\n             The most sensible interpretation is the first, and we\n\nconstrue the district court's order accordingly.                    Under Murphy, if\n\nYork can assert his Fifth Amendment privilege without risking\n\nrevocation, he does not face a \"classic penalty situation,\" 465\n\nU.S.   at    435   &   n.7,    and    his    answers       will   not   be   considered\n\n\"compelled\" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment unless he is\n\n\n                                            -22-\n\fforced to answer over his valid assertion of privilege, see id. at\n\n429.   At oral argument, the government conceded that this is the\n\nbest interpretation and agreed that it is acceptable; York likewise\n\nfound it preferable.        Construing the order in this way also\n\nguarantees that if York and his probation officers dispute whether\n\nhe refused to answer a question on valid Fifth Amendment grounds,\n\nYork will be entitled to a hearing before a court before any\n\npenalty can be imposed.\n\n            We construe the district court's order to provide that\n\nYork's supervised release shall not be revoked based on his valid\n\nassertion    of    Fifth   Amendment   privilege   during   a   polygraph\n\nexamination.      So construed, York's sentence, including the special\n\nconditions of supervised release, is valid.        See United States v.\n\nDavis, 242 F.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir. 2001) (per curiam) (construing\n\ncondition of supervised release to avoid Fifth Amendment issues and\n\nupholding the sentence as construed).        To the extent York raises\n\nspecific Fifth Amendment objections to incriminating questions that\n\nmay be asked or coercive tactics that may be employed by the\n\nProbation Office, his arguments are premature.        York remains free\n\nto assert his Fifth Amendment privilege if, after he begins his\n\nsupervised release term in 2006, such circumstances actually arise.\n\nSee id.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\f                                     III.\n\n             The   judgment   of   the   district   court   is   affirmed   as\n\nconstrued.

In September 2002, York was sentenced to 41 months in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release.

This is so by statute. Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d), the district court may impose any special condition of supervised release that it considers \"appropriate,\" provided that the condition satisfies certain specified criteria. One such criterion is that the condition imposed be \"reasonably related to the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1).\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3583(d)(1). Section 3553(a)(1), in turn, requires the court to consider \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\" <i>See also</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(b). In this case, the facts are drawn from the pre-sentence report, as amended to reflect York's minor objections, and from the transcript of the sentencing hearing. <i>See United States v.

On July 2, York mailed a letter to A.S., his estranged common-law wife and a relative of the girl whom he had assaulted. In the letter, York wrote: \"I can not and will not let you live. I make this statement knowing full well what the consequences are.... You will be dead, and I will be in jail.

Among York's prior offenses were two convictions in Massachusetts state court for indecent assaults upon minors. In the first incident, which occurred in 1993, York bought alcohol for a minor girl who was over the age of fourteen and then subjected her to an indecent assault and battery. The second incident, which occurred in 1999, was York's sexual assault on the girl related to A.S.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of York's criminal history and the dictates of the career offender guideline, the district court determined that the applicable guidelines range was 37 to 46 months. York sought a downward departure on the basis of diminished capacity, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.13, which the court denied on the ground that &#167; 5K2.13 does not permit departures where the defendant's conduct involved \"a serious threat of violence.\" <i>Id.</i> The court then added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I also agree with the government that... this particular defendant's criminal history indicates a need to incarcerate him to protect the public. He has shown himself capable of committing, not one, but two very dastardly and heinous sexual crimes against defenseless young women....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court warned York that he would spend the rest of his life in prison if he were ever arrested again for committing a violent crime, \"particularly a crime against people who are defenseless.\" York was sentenced to 41 months in prison plus a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the standard conditions of supervised release, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(c), the court imposed on York several special conditions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant is to participate in a sex offender specific treatment program at the direction of the Probation Office. The defendant shall be required to submit to periodic polygraph testing as a means to insure that he is in compliance with the requirements of his therapeutic program. No violation proceedings will arise based solely on a defendant's failure to \"pass\" the polygraph. Such an event could, however, generate a separate investigation. When submitting to a polygraph exam, the defendant does not give up his Fifth Amendment rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government had not asked the court to impose these conditions on York, nor had the Probation Office recommended them in York's pre-sentence report (PSR).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Defense counsel, however, did not object when the court listed them among the conditions it was imposing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several months after the sentencing hearing, York filed a motion to modify the sex offender treatment and polygraph testing conditions. The district court denied the motion because York had already filed a notice of appeal to this court raising the same issues. York's motion to reconsider that denial was denied on the same ground. <i>Cf. United States v. Distasio,</i> 820 F.2d 20, 23 (1st Cir.1987) (pending notice of appeal deprives the district court of jurisdiction over the substance of the appeal).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">York attacks the conditions of his supervised release on multiple grounds. He argues (1) that the district court could not require him to attend a sex offender treatment program as a condition of supervised release because his &#167; 876 conviction did not involve a sex-related offense; and (2) that the mandatory polygraph testing condition is invalid because (i) it will compel him to incriminate himself in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights; (ii) it constitutes an impermissible delegation of the judicial function to non-judicial officers; and (iii) it is an inherently unreliable and thus unreasonable means of ensuring compliance with supervised release conditions. We address each of these contentions in turn, saving for last the more troublesome issues raised by York's Fifth Amendment challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties disagree on the applicable standard of review. This court ordinarily reviews challenges to conditions of supervised release for abuse of discretion, but if the issue is forfeited, review is for plain error only. <i>United States v. Mansur-Ramos,</i> 348 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir.2003). The government argues that York forfeited his objections to the conditions of his supervised release by failing to raise them during the sentencing hearing. We have accepted this argument elsewhere. <i>See, e.g., id.; United States v. Brown,</i> 235 F.3d 2, 3-4 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">York acknowledges that he failed to object below. Nevertheless, he argues that a contemporaneous objection was not required because, given that the conduct for which he was convicted was unrelated to sex, and given that neither the government nor the PSR proposed sex offender treatment or polygraph testing, he could not reasonably have anticipated the special conditions imposed by the court. We are doubtful. Considering York's history of sexual offenses and violence against women, it should not have been difficult to predict the court's interest in such conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, we need not decide which of these arguments should prevail, for our conclusion in York's case is the same under either standard of review. But there is a serious consequence to the belatedness of York's attack. As the government correctly points out, there is no factual record developed as to the specific sex offender treatment program that York will be required to attend, the types of polygraph exams that may be administered, or even the questions that York will likely be required to answer. While the relevant treatment programs or polygraph technology may be somewhat different in 2006, information as to existing programs and polygraph exams is surely available and would have been helpful. A timely objection and the creation of a record would have permitted both the district court and this court to review York's claims with the benefit of that information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sex Offender Treatment Requirement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">York argues that because his conviction was for mailing a threatening communication, not for a sex-related crime, the requirement that he participate in a sex offender treatment program imposes a \"greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary\" to deter criminal conduct or protect the public. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(b). York misunderstands the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Guidelines do not limit district courts to consideration only of the facts of the crime charged. A sentencing court should consider each defendant's history, regardless of the nature of the crime of conviction. The judge has the authority to impose any condition of supervised release that is reasonably related to (1) the defendant's offense, history, and characteristics; (2) the need to deter the defendant from further criminal conduct; (3) the need to protect the public from further crimes by the defendant; and (4) the effective educational, vocational, medical, or other correctional treatment of the defendant. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(b)(1); <i>see also</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d)(1); <i>Mansur-Ramos,</i> 348 F.3d at 33; <i>United States v. Peppe,</i> 80 F.3d 19, 23 (1st Cir.1996). Although these factors are connected by the word \"and,\" <i>see</i> &#167; 3583(d)(1); &#167; 5D1.3(b)(1), \"the critical test is whether the challenged condition is sufficiently related to <i>one or more</i> of the permissible goals of supervised release.\" <i>Brown,</i> 235 F.3d at 6 (emphasis added); <i>see also United States v. Barajas,</i> 331 F.3d 1141, 1146-47 (10th Cir.2003) (noting that every circuit to have decided the issue has adopted this interpretation notwithstanding the \"and\" conjunction). So the fact that a condition of supervised release is not directly related to York's crime of conviction does not render that condition per se invalid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">York acknowledges these principles but argues that sex offender treatment is uniquely reserved for cases involving sex offenses. He points to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(d)(7), which provides that a special condition requiring the defendant's participation in a sex-offender treatment program should be imposed \"if the instant offense of conviction is a sex offense.\" But this is little aid to York, as the Guidelines conspicuously do <i>not</i> say that sex-offender treatment is appropriate <i>only</i> if the underlying crime was a sex offense. In fact, the preamble to &#167; 5D1.3(d) provides that the special conditions listed therein, including participation in a program for sex offenders, \"are recommended in the circumstances described and, in addition, <i>may otherwise be appropriate in particular cases.</i>\" (emphasis added). And nothing in the statute underlying &#167; 5D1.3 limits the special condition of sex-offender treatment to defendants under prosecution for sex crimes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are, however, several limitations on a district court's power to fashion special conditions of supervised release. We list a few. First, a special condition must in fact be tailored to the circumstances: it can involve \"no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary\" to achieve the purposes of supervised release. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(b)(2). Second, the condition imposed must be consistent with any pertinent policy statements from the Sentencing Commission. <i>Id.</i> Finally, the trial court's decision to impose the challenged condition must have adequate evidentiary support in the record. <i>Brown,</i> 235 F.3d at 6; <i>United States v. Thurlow,</i> 44 F.3d 46, 46 n. 3 (1st Cir. 1995) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given York's criminal history and in light of the record in this case, which includes a threat of violence by York against yet another woman, the district court was well within its discretion in requiring York to participate in the sex offender treatment program. The condition that he attend sex-offender treatment is plainly related to his criminal history: York has twice been convicted for sexually assaulting young girls, including one conviction only a year before he mailed his threatening letter to A.S. <i>See United States v. Peterson,</i> 248 F.3d 79, 84 (2d Cir.2001) (approving a special release condition of sex-offender treatment for a defendant convicted of bank larceny where the defendant had been convicted of a sex offense in state court five years earlier).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">York's proven recidivism, moreover, makes the condition reasonably related to another permissible purpose of supervised release: protecting the public from further crimes by the defendant. In <i>McKune v. Lile,</i> 536 U.S. 24, 122 S.Ct. 2017, 153 L.Ed.2d 47 (2002), the Supreme Court observed that convicted sex offenders who reenter society are \"much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested for a new rape or sexual assault.\" <i>Id.</i> at 33, 122 S.Ct. 2017. Furthermore, treatment programs of the kind the district court has required York to attend may \"enable sex offenders to manage their impulses and in this way reduce recidivism.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court's remarks during sentencing make clear that the court believed that York needed such treatment and that he continued to pose a risk to young girls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court committed no error, plain or otherwise, in requiring York to participate in a sex-offender treatment program as a condition of his supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Mandatory Polygraph Testing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More serious is York's Fifth Amendment challenge to the mandatory polygraph testing requirement in his supervised release conditions. We turn to that question after addressing York's two threshold objections to the polygraph testing condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Impermissible delegation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">York contends that the polygraph testing requirement, as worded in the district court's order, unlawfully delegates to non-judicial officers the power to determine matters of punishment. He argues that the district court's command that he \"shall be required to submit to periodic polygraph testing as a means to insure that he is in compliance with the requirements of his therapeutic program\" is vague as to the frequency, duration, and allowable scope of the questioning. By failing to specify these details, York claims, the district court impermissibly assigned to the Probation Office the power to determine the nature and extent of his punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court committed no error in allowing York's probation officers to determine these details. Federal courts are not prohibited from \"using nonjudicial officers to support judicial functions, as long as th[e] judicial officer retains and exercises ultimate responsibility.\" <i>United States v. Allen,</i> 312 F.3d 512, 515-16 (1st Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the district court left no significant penological decision to the discretion of the Probation Office: the court itself determined that York \"is to participate\" in a treatment program for sex offenders and that York \"shall be required\" to submit to polygraph testing to confirm his compliance with his treatment regimen. This distinguishes York's case from our recent decision in <i>United States v. Melendez-Santana,</i> 353 F.3d 93 (1st Cir.2003). In <i>Melendez-Santana,</i> this court upheld a delegation challenge to a special condition of supervised release because the district court had authorized the defendant's probation officer to determine not only the details of the defendant's drug treatment, but also <i>whether</i> the defendant would be required to undergo such treatment. <i>Id.</i> at 101; <i>see also Peterson,</i> 248 F.3d at 84-85; <i>United States v. Kent,</i> 209 F.3d 1073, 1079 (8th Cir.2000). In this case, the district court made all such decisions itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, contrary to York's assertion, the district court did restrict the scope of permissible questioning: the polygraph testing is \"a means to [e]nsure that [York] is in compliance with the requirements of his therapeutic program.\" This is a permissibly narrow delegation of administrative details. <i>See Melendez-Santana,</i> 353 F.3d at 101 n. 6 (the question of which drug program a defendant must attend, and when he may be discharged, involves \"administrative details\" properly delegated to a probation officer); <i>Allen,</i> 312 F.3d at 516. Indeed, the delegation here is narrower than the one that this court upheld in <i>Allen</i> as acceptable reliance on probation officers' administrative expertise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See</i> 312 F.3d at 515-16 (upholding a condition requiring the defendant to participate in mental health treatment \"as directed by the probation officer, until such time as the defendant is released from the program by the probation officer\"). York's reliance on <i>United States v. Merric,</i> 166 F.3d 406 (1st Cir.1999), is misplaced. In <i>Merric,</i> this court vacated the defendant's sentence because the trial court impermissibly delegated to a probation officer the power to set the defendant's fine payment schedule. <i>See id.</i> at 408-09. If a probation officer cannot set a fine payment schedule, York argues, a schedule of polygraph sessions should be equally off-limits. The analogy is not persuasive. <i>Merric</i> simply held that \"it is the inherent responsibility of the judge to determine matters of punishment and this includes final authority over all payment matters.\" <i>Id.</i> at 409. But the schedule of installment payments for a fine or restitution order has a far more material impact on a defendant than the timing of intermittent polygraph examinations. Setting the former may be a \"core judicial function,\" <i>United States v. Miller,</i> 77 F.3d 71, 78 (4th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted), but scheduling the latter is surely a matter of administrative detail. Here, the court provided that the polygraph testing shall be \"periodic,\" and that the purpose of the testing shall be to determine whether York is cooperating with his therapy. Further detail from the court was not required. <i>Cf. United States v. Fellows,</i> 157 F.3d 1197, 1204 (9th Cir.1998) (observing that a sentencing court \"cannot be expected to design and implement the particularities of a treatment program\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Inherent unreliability</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">York next asserts that the polygraph requirement is unreasonable, and thus invalid, because polygraph tests are inherently unreliable and cannot measure whether he is in fact complying with his treatment program. York points to the Supreme Court's acknowledgment that \"there is simply no consensus that polygraph evidence is reliable.\" <i>United States v. Scheffer,</i> 523 U.S. 303, 309, 118 S.Ct. 1261, 140 L.Ed.2d 413 (1998). In response, the United States does not deny that polygraph technology is of doubtful reliability, but it asserts that the polygraph is nevertheless a useful tool for policing defendants' compliance with conditions of supervised release. Regardless of the device's actual ability to detect lies, the government suggests, the polygraph provides an incentive for York to pursue his treatment program honestly because he may believe that if he lies about his progress, the polygraph will expose him. At least one court of appeals has endorsed this view. <i>See United States v. Taylor,</i> 338 F.3d 1280, 1284 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003) (polygraph testing is useful in promoting the treatment of sex offenders because \"probationers fear that any false denials of violations will be detected\"); <i>see also United States v. Lee,</i> 315 F.3d 206, 217 (3d Cir.2003) (polygraph testing can be \"beneficial in enhancing the supervision and treatment\" of a sex offender).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in this case provides no factual foundation on which to evaluate these arguments. The court imposed the polygraph condition <i>sua sponte;</i> neither side submitted evidence on the usefulness or reliability of polygraph exams. This leaves a difficult empirical problem that appellate courts are not well suited to resolve. Perhaps polygraph technology has become more reliable in the five years since the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Scheffer.</i> Or perhaps it will be more reliable when York actually begins his supervised release in 2006. Or perhaps the whole theory of polygraph examinations is irredeemably flawed. <i>Cf. Scheffer,</i> 523 U.S. at 310, 118 S.Ct. 1261 (citing studies challenging the scientific basis for polygraph tests). Those questions are unanswerable on this record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, we cannot accept on faith that polygraphs are effective at deterring lies, irrespective of their accuracy. The deterrent effect of polygraph testing, after all, is related to the reliability question: York will only be deterred from lying if he believes that a polygraph will likely expose his lies. Perhaps polygraphs, while imperfect, are reliable enough to achieve this deterrent effect. Perhaps they will be so reliable in 2006. The record provides no basis on which to make such a determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we decline to issue a blanket decision on the propriety of polygraph testing as a tool of supervised release. To the extent York fears that a false positive on a polygraph exam will automatically result in the revocation of his supervised release, the district court has anticipated and addressed his concerns. According to the court's order, \"[n]o violation proceedings will arise based solely on [the] defendant's failure to `pass' the polygraph.\" Given this prophylaxis, the use of a polygraph to promote York's rehabilitation is not per se unreasonable. If, after his supervised release begins, York believes that he has been prejudiced by the unreliability of a polygraph test (or by the burdensomeness of the polygraph regime as administered by the Probation Office), he is free to marshal supporting scientific evidence and petition the district court to modify the conditions of his supervised release. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(2). Until that time, any specific claim of prejudice is premature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Fifth Amendment claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">York's most potent challenge to the mandatory polygraph requirement is that it violates his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. York contends that in the course of his treatment program he will inevitably be asked incriminating questions, and that he will be compelled to answer due to the severe consequences to him of revocation: because his criminal history category is VI, York would face a minimum of eight months in prison if his supervised release were revoked. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the United States does not dispute that the Fifth Amendment applies in interviews with probation officers, regardless of whether a polygraph is involved. <i>See Minnesota v. Murphy,</i> 465 U.S. 420, 426, 104 S.Ct. 1136, 79 L.Ed.2d 409 (1984). Instead, it argues that the mandatory polygraph condition does not on its face \"compel\" York to give incriminating answers. <i>Cf. United States v. Washington,</i> 431 U.S. 181, 188, 97 S.Ct. 1814, 52 L.Ed.2d 238 (1977) (\"[The] constitutional guarantee is only that the witness be not <i>compelled</i> to give self-incriminating testimony.\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with first principles. Nothing in the Fifth Amendment mitigates the general obligation on probationers to appear and answer questions truthfully. <i>See Murphy,</i> 465 U.S. at 427, 104 S.Ct. 1136. Probation officers may demand honest answers to their questions, just as prosecutors may demand truthful answers from grand jury witnesses subpoenaed to testify. <i>See id.</i> Further, because revocation proceedings are not criminal proceedings, York will not be entitled to refuse to answer questions solely on the ground that his replies may lead to revocation of his supervised release. <i>Id.</i> at 435 n. 7, 104 S.Ct. 1136. York's probation officers, by requiring him to answer such questions, will not \"compel\" him to incriminate himself within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. <i>See id.</i> at 427-28, 435 n. 7, 104 S.Ct. 1136. Of course, York will have a valid Fifth Amendment claim if his probation officers ask, and compel him to answer over his assertion of privilege, a particular question implicating him in \"a crime other than that for which he has been convicted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 426, 104 S.Ct. 1136. But York cannot mount a generalized Fifth Amendment attack on the conditions of his supervised release on the ground that he will be required to answer probation officers' questions truthfully.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, then, is whether the requirement that York submit to polygraph tests during these interviews alters the constitutional analysis. The government says that it does not, arguing that the polygraph merely enforces the general obligation on probationers to answer questions concerning their probationary status truthfully. In the government's view, the polygraph requirement adds nothing relevant to the Fifth Amendment analysis: York might have valid claims of privilege as to particular questions, but the mandatory polygraph condition on its face does not implicate York's Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the polygraph requirement may implicate York's Fifth Amendment rights, depending on how the district court's order is understood. One reading of the release condition is that it flatly requires York to submit to polygraph testing as a condition of his supervised release, so that York's refusal to answer any question &#8212; even on valid Fifth Amendment grounds &#8212; could constitute a basis for revocation. If that reading were intended, it would be constitutionally problematic. The Supreme Court has reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]f the state, either expressly or by implication, asserts that invocation of the privilege would lead to revocation of probation, it would have created the classic penalty situation, the failure to assert the privilege would be excused, and the probationer's answers would be deemed compelled and inadmissible in a criminal prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Murphy,</i> 465 U.S. at 435, 104 S.Ct. 1136.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sensitive to Fifth Amendment issues, the district court inserted a caveat in its order: \"When submitting to a polygraph exam, the defendant does not give up his Fifth Amendment rights.\" The government argues that this qualification obviates any concern that the polygraph requirement on its face compels York to incriminate himself. It might well have been intended to do so, but the qualification is ambiguous. The court stated only that York \"does not give up his Fifth Amendment rights\" in submitting to polygraph testing. That could mean (1) that York's supervised release will not be revoked based on his refusal to answer polygraph questions on valid Fifth Amendment grounds; (2) that York must answer every question during his polygraph exams on pain of revocation, but that his answers will not be used against him in any future prosecution; or simply (3) that York will be entitled, in any future prosecution, to seek exclusion of his answers on the grounds that the polygraph procedure forced him to incriminate himself. York objects to the second interpretation because he fears that it is ultra vires: the district court, he says, probably lacks the power to grant him immunity from future prosecutions, state or federal, based on information that he may reveal to his probation officers. And the third interpretation offers him no assurances at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most sensible interpretation is the first, and we construe the district court's order accordingly. Under <i>Murphy,</i> if York can assert his Fifth Amendment privilege without risking revocation, he does not face a \"classic penalty situation,\" 465 U.S. at 435 &amp; n. 7, 104 S.Ct. 1136, and his answers will not be considered \"compelled\" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment unless he is forced to answer over his valid assertion of privilege, <i>see id.</i> at 429, 104 S.Ct. 1136. At oral argument, the government conceded that this is the best interpretation and agreed that it is acceptable; York likewise found it preferable. Construing the order in this way also guarantees that if York and his probation officers dispute whether he refused to answer a question on valid Fifth Amendment grounds, York will be entitled to a hearing before a court before any penalty can be imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We construe the district court's order to provide that York's supervised release shall not be revoked based on his valid assertion of Fifth Amendment privilege during a polygraph examination. So construed, York's sentence, including the special conditions of supervised release, is valid. <i>See United States v. Davis,</i> 242 F.3d 49, 52 (1st Cir.2001) (per curiam) (construing condition of supervised release to avoid Fifth Amendment issues and upholding the sentence as construed). To the extent York raises specific Fifth Amendment objections to incriminating questions that may be asked or coercive tactics that may be employed by the Probation Office, his arguments are premature. York remains free to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege if, after he begins his supervised release term in 2006, such circumstances actually arise. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed</i> as construed. <i>So ordered.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In July 2001, following his release from state prison and before his arrest for mailing the letter, York visited A.S. without incident</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The court further prohibited York from possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon, ordered him to participate in a drug testing program as well as a mental health program, barred him from consuming any alcoholic beverages, and prohibited him from identifying himself by anything other than his true name.

In September 2002, York was sentenced to 41 months in prison, to be followed by three years of supervised release.

This is so by statute. Under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d), the district court may impose any special condition of supervised release that it considers \"appropriate,\" provided that the condition satisfies certain specified criteria. One such criterion is that the condition imposed be \"reasonably related to the factors set forth in section 3553(a)(1).\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 3583(d)(1). Section 3553(a)(1), in turn, requires the court to consider \"the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant.\" <i>See also</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(b). In this case, the facts are drawn from the pre-sentence report, as amended to reflect York's minor objections, and from the transcript of the sentencing hearing. <i>See United States v.

On July 2, York mailed a letter to A.S., his estranged common-law wife and a relative of the girl whom he had assaulted. In the letter, York wrote: \"I can not and will not let you live. I make this statement knowing full well what the consequences are.... You will be dead, and I will be in jail. You may take this as an idle threat if you choose to, but I will find and exterminate you. You will cease to exist.\" He signed the letter \"L. York.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.S. reported the letter to the authorities, and on July 13, the FBI visited York in jail. He agreed to be interviewed, signed a waiver of his <i>Miranda</i> rights, and admitted that he had sent the letter. His lawyer later explained that York decided to write the letter when he learned that A.S. was planning to move away and take their children with her.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A federal criminal complaint was filed against York in the District of Massachusetts in February 2002, and York was ordered detained pending indictment and trial. In April 2002, the government formally charged York with violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 876, which makes it a crime to send via the U.S. Postal Service any \"communication... addressed to any other person and containing ... any threat to injure the person of the addressee.\" &#167; 876(c). On May 13, 2002, York pled guilty to the charge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing in September 2002, the district court determined, and the parties agreed, that York's criminal history qualified him as a \"career offender\" under U.S.S.G. &#167; 4B1.1. Among York's prior offenses were two convictions in Massachusetts state court for indecent assaults upon minors. In the first incident, which occurred in 1993, York bought alcohol for a minor girl who was over the age of fourteen and then subjected her to an indecent assault and battery. The second incident, which occurred in 1999, was York's sexual assault on the girl related to A.S.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of York's criminal history and the dictates of the career offender guideline, the district court determined that the applicable guidelines range was 37 to 46 months. York sought a downward departure on the basis of diminished capacity, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.13, which the court denied on the ground that &#167; 5K2.13 does not permit departures where the defendant's conduct involved \"a serious threat of violence.\" <i>Id.</i> The court then added:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I also agree with the government that... this particular defendant's criminal history indicates a need to incarcerate him to protect the public. He has shown himself capable of committing, not one, but two very dastardly and heinous sexual crimes against defenseless young women....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court warned York that he would spend the rest of his life in prison if he were ever arrested again for committing a violent crime, \"particularly a crime against people who are defenseless.\" York was sentenced to 41 months in prison plus a three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the standard conditions of supervised release, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(c), the court imposed on York several special conditions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant is to participate in a sex offender specific treatment program at the direction of the Probation Office. The defendant shall be required to submit to periodic polygraph testing as a means to insure that he is in compliance with the requirements of his therapeutic program. No violation proceedings will arise based solely on a defendant's failure to \"pass\" the polygraph. Such an event could, however, generate a separate investigation. When submitting to a polygraph exam, the defendant does not give up his Fifth Amendment rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government had not asked the court to impose these conditions on York, nor had the Probation Office recommended them in York's pre-sentence report (PSR).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Defense counsel, however, did not object when the court listed them among the conditions it was imposing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several months after the sentencing hearing, York filed a motion to modify the sex offender treatment and polygraph testing conditions. The district court denied the motion because York had already filed a notice of appeal to this court raising the same issues. York's motion to reconsider that denial was denied on the same ground. <i>Cf. United States v. Distasio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"489326\"><a href=\"/opinion/489326/united-states-v-louis-distasio-sr-united-states-of-america-v-jerry-j/\"><span class=\"volume\">820</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.1987) (pending notice of appeal deprives the district court of jurisdiction over the substance of the appeal).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">York attacks the conditions of his supervised release on multiple grounds. He argues (1) that the district court could not require him to attend a sex offender treatment program as a condition of supervised release because his &#167; 876 conviction did not involve a sex-related offense; and (2) that the mandatory polygraph testing condition is invalid because (i) it will compel him to incriminate himself in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights; (ii) it constitutes an impermissible delegation of the judicial function to non-judicial officers; and (iii) it is an inherently unreliable and thus unreasonable means of ensuring compliance with supervised release conditions. We address each of these contentions in turn, saving for last the more troublesome issues raised by York's Fifth Amendment challenge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties disagree on the applicable standard of review. This court ordinarily reviews challenges to conditions of supervised release for abuse of discretion, but if the issue is forfeited, review is for plain error only. <i>United States v. Mansur-Ramos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200710\"><a href=\"/opinion/200710/united-states-v-mansur-ramos/\"><span class=\"volume\">348</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2003). The government argues that York forfeited his objections to the conditions of his supervised release by failing to raise them during the sentencing hearing. We have accepted this argument elsewhere. <i>See, e.g., id.; United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199192\"><a href=\"/opinion/199192/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></a></span>, 3-4 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">York acknowledges that he failed to object below. Nevertheless, he argues that a contemporaneous objection was not required because, given that the conduct for which he was convicted was unrelated to sex, and given that neither the government nor the PSR proposed sex offender treatment or polygraph testing, he could not reasonably have anticipated the special conditions imposed by the court. We are doubtful. Considering York's history of sexual offenses and violence against women, it should not have been difficult to predict the court's interest in such conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, we need not decide which of these arguments should prevail, for our conclusion in York's case is the same under either standard of review. But there is a serious consequence to the belatedness of York's attack. As the government correctly points out, there is no factual record developed as to the specific sex offender treatment program that York will be required to attend, the types of polygraph exams that may be administered, or even the questions that York will likely be required to answer. While the relevant treatment programs or polygraph technology may be somewhat different in 2006, information as to existing programs and polygraph exams is surely available and would have been helpful. A timely objection and the creation of a record would have permitted both the district court and this court to review York's claims with the benefit of that information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Sex Offender Treatment Requirement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">York argues that because his conviction was for mailing a threatening communication, not for a sex-related crime, the requirement that he participate in a sex offender treatment program imposes a \"greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary\" to deter criminal conduct or protect the public. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(b). York misunderstands the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Guidelines do not limit district courts to consideration only of the facts of the crime charged. A sentencing court should consider each defendant's history, regardless of the nature of the crime of conviction. The judge has the authority to impose any condition of supervised release that is reasonably related to (1) the defendant's offense, history, and characteristics; (2) the need to deter the defendant from further criminal conduct; (3) the need to protect the public from further crimes by the defendant; and (4) the effective educational, vocational, medical, or other correctional treatment of the defendant. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(b)(1); <i>see also</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d)(1); <i>Mansur-Ramos,</i> 348 F.3d at 33; <i>United States v. Peppe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196672\"><a href=\"/opinion/196672/united-states-v-peppe/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">19</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.1996). Although these factors are connected by the word \"and,\" <i>see</i> &#167; 3583(d)(1); &#167; 5D1.3(b)(1), \"the critical test is whether the challenged condition is sufficiently related to <i>one or more</i> of the permissible goals of supervised release.\" <i>Brown,</i> 235 F.3d at 6 (emphasis added); <i>see also United States v. Barajas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"163551\"><a href=\"/opinion/163551/united-states-v-barajas/\"><span class=\"volume\">331</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1141</span></a></span>, 1146-47 (10th Cir.2003) (noting that every circuit to have decided the issue has adopted this interpretation notwithstanding the \"and\" conjunction). So the fact that a condition of supervised release is not directly related to York's crime of conviction does not render that condition per se invalid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">York acknowledges these principles but argues that sex offender treatment is uniquely reserved for cases involving sex offenses. He points to U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(d)(7), which provides that a special condition requiring the defendant's participation in a sex-offender treatment program should be imposed \"if the instant offense of conviction is a sex offense.\" But this is little aid to York, as the Guidelines conspicuously do <i>not</i> say that sex-offender treatment is appropriate <i>only</i> if the underlying crime was a sex offense. In fact, the preamble to &#167; 5D1.3(d) provides that the special conditions listed therein, including participation in a program for sex offenders, \"are recommended in the circumstances described and, in addition, <i>may otherwise be appropriate in particular cases.</i>\" (emphasis added). And nothing in the statute underlying &#167; 5D1.3 limits the special condition of sex-offender treatment to defendants under prosecution for sex crimes.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are, however, several limitations on a district court's power to fashion special conditions of supervised release. We list a few. First, a special condition must in fact be tailored to the circumstances: it can involve \"no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary\" to achieve the purposes of supervised release. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(b)(2). Second, the condition imposed must be consistent with any pertinent policy statements from the Sentencing Commission. <i>Id.</i> Finally, the trial court's decision to impose the challenged condition must have adequate evidentiary support in the record. <i>Brown,</i> 235 F.3d at 6; <i>United States v. Thurlow,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195843\"><a href=\"/opinion/195843/united-states-v-thurlow/\"><span class=\"volume\">44</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 46 n. 3 (1st Cir. 1995) (per curiam).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given York's criminal history and in light of the record in this case, which includes a threat of violence by York against yet another woman, the district court was well within its discretion in requiring York to participate in the sex offender treatment program. The condition that he attend sex-offender treatment is plainly related to his criminal history: York has twice been convicted for sexually assaulting young girls, including one conviction only a year before he mailed his threatening letter to A.S. <i>See United States v. Peterson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773009\"><a href=\"/opinion/773009/united-states-v-larry-peterson/\"><span class=\"volume\">248</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">79</span></a></span>, 84 (2d Cir.2001) (approving a special release condition of sex-offender treatment for a defendant convicted of bank larceny where the defendant had been convicted of a sex offense in state court five years earlier).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">York's proven recidivism, moreover, makes the condition reasonably related to another permissible purpose of supervised release: protecting the public from further crimes by the defendant.

Furthermore, treatment programs of the kind the district court has required York to attend may \"enable sex offenders to manage their impulses and in this way reduce recidivism.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court's remarks during sentencing make clear that the court believed that York needed such treatment and that he continued to pose a risk to young girls.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court committed no error, plain or otherwise, in requiring York to participate in a sex-offender treatment program as a condition of his supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Mandatory Polygraph Testing</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">More serious is York's Fifth Amendment challenge to the mandatory polygraph testing requirement in his supervised release conditions. We turn to that question after addressing York's two threshold objections to the polygraph testing condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Impermissible delegation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">York contends that the polygraph testing requirement, as worded in the district court's order, unlawfully delegates to non-judicial officers the power to determine matters of punishment. He argues that the district court's command that he \"shall be required to submit to periodic polygraph testing as a means to insure that he is in compliance with the requirements of his therapeutic program\" is vague as to the frequency, duration, and allowable scope of the questioning. By failing to specify these details, York claims, the district court impermissibly assigned to the Probation Office the power to determine the nature and extent of his punishment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court committed no error in allowing York's probation officers to determine these details. Federal courts are not prohibited from \"using nonjudicial officers to support judicial functions, as long as th[e] judicial officer retains and exercises ultimate responsibility.\" <i>United States v. Allen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200235\"><a href=\"/opinion/200235/united-states-v-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">312</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">512</span></a></span>, 515-16 (1st Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, the district court left no significant penological decision to the discretion of the Probation Office: the court itself determined that York \"is to participate\" in a treatment program for sex offenders and that York \"shall be required\" to submit to polygraph testing to confirm his compliance with his treatment regimen. This distinguishes York's case from our recent decision in <i>United States v. Melendez-Santana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200784\"><a href=\"/opinion/200784/united-states-v-melendez-santana/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">93</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2003). In <i>Melendez-Santana,</i> this court upheld a delegation challenge to a special condition of supervised release because the district court had authorized the defendant's probation officer to determine not only the details of the defendant's drug treatment, but also <i>whether</i> the defendant would be required to undergo such treatment. <i>Id.</i> at 101; <i>see also Peterson,</i> 248 F.3d at 84-85; <i>United States v. Kent,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768403\"><a href=\"/opinion/768403/united-states-v-eugene-p-kent/\"><span class=\"volume\">209</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span>, 1079 (8th Cir.2000). In this case, the district court made all such decisions itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, contrary to York's assertion, the district court did restrict the scope of permissible questioning: the polygraph testing is \"a means to [e]nsure that [York] is in compliance with the requirements of his therapeutic program.\" This is a permissibly narrow delegation of administrative details. <i>See Melendez-Santana,</i> 353 F.3d at 101 n. 6 (the question of which drug program a defendant must attend, and when he may be discharged, involves \"administrative details\" properly delegated to a probation officer); <i>Allen,</i> 312 F.3d at 516. Indeed, the delegation here is narrower than the one that this court upheld in <i>Allen</i> as acceptable reliance on probation officers' administrative expertise.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See</i> 312 F.3d at 515-16 (upholding a condition requiring the defendant to participate in mental health treatment \"as directed by the probation officer, until such time as the defendant is released from the program by the probation officer\"). York's reliance on <i>United States v. Merric,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198307\"><a href=\"/opinion/198307/united-states-v-merric/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1999), is misplaced. In <i>Merric,</i> this court vacated the defendant's sentence because the trial court impermissibly delegated to a probation officer the power to set the defendant's fine payment schedule. <i>See id.</i> at 408-09. If a probation officer cannot set a fine payment schedule, York argues, a schedule of polygraph sessions should be equally off-limits. The analogy is not persuasive. <i>Merric</i> simply held that \"it is the inherent responsibility of the judge to determine matters of punishment and this includes final authority over all payment matters.\" <i>Id.</i> at 409. But the schedule of installment payments for a fine or restitution order has a far more material impact on a defendant than the timing of intermittent polygraph examinations. Setting the former may be a \"core judicial function,\" <i>United States v. Miller,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"713048\"><a href=\"/opinion/713048/united-states-v-james-barnett-miller/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 78 (4th Cir.1996) (internal quotation marks omitted), but scheduling the latter is surely a matter of administrative detail. Here, the court provided that the polygraph testing shall be \"periodic,\" and that the purpose of the testing shall be to determine whether York is cooperating with his therapy. Further detail from the court was not required. <i>Cf. United States v. Fellows,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"758528\"><a href=\"/opinion/758528/united-states-v-otis-w-fellows-iii/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1197</span></a></span>, 1204 (9th Cir.1998) (observing that a sentencing court \"cannot be expected to design and implement the particularities of a treatment program\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Inherent unreliability</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">York next asserts that the polygraph requirement is unreasonable, and thus invalid, because polygraph tests are inherently unreliable and cannot measure whether he is in fact complying with his treatment program. York points to the Supreme Court's acknowledgment that \"there is simply no consensus that polygraph evidence is reliable.\" <i>United States v. Scheffer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118191\"><a href=\"/opinion/118191/united-states-v-scheffer/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span>, 309, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118191\"><a href=\"/opinion/118191/united-states-v-scheffer/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">413</span></a></span> (1998). In response, the United States does not deny that polygraph technology is of doubtful reliability, but it asserts that the polygraph is nevertheless a useful tool for policing defendants' compliance with conditions of supervised release. Regardless of the device's actual ability to detect lies, the government suggests, the polygraph provides an incentive for York to pursue his treatment program honestly because he may believe that if he lies about his progress, the polygraph will expose him. At least one court of appeals has endorsed this view. <i>See United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76239\"><a href=\"/opinion/76239/us-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1280</span></a></span>, 1284 n. 2 (11th Cir.2003) (polygraph testing is useful in promoting the treatment of sex offenders because \"probationers fear that any false denials of violations will be detected\"); <i>see also United States v. Lee,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780364\"><a href=\"/opinion/780364/united-states-v-albert-m-lee/\"><span class=\"volume\">315</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">206</span></a></span>, 217 (3d Cir.2003) (polygraph testing can be \"beneficial in enhancing the supervision and treatment\" of a sex offender).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record in this case provides no factual foundation on which to evaluate these arguments. The court imposed the polygraph condition <i>sua sponte;</i> neither side submitted evidence on the usefulness or reliability of polygraph exams. This leaves a difficult empirical problem that appellate courts are not well suited to resolve. Perhaps polygraph technology has become more reliable in the five years since the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Scheffer.</i> Or perhaps it will be more reliable when York actually begins his supervised release in 2006. Or perhaps the whole theory of polygraph examinations is irredeemably flawed. <i>Cf. Scheffer,</i> 523 U.S. at 310, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118191\"><a href=\"/opinion/118191/united-states-v-scheffer/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1261</span></a></span> (citing studies challenging the scientific basis for polygraph tests). Those questions are unanswerable on this record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Similarly, we cannot accept on faith that polygraphs are effective at deterring lies, irrespective of their accuracy. The deterrent effect of polygraph testing, after all, is related to the reliability question: York will only be deterred from lying if he believes that a polygraph will likely expose his lies. Perhaps polygraphs, while imperfect, are reliable enough to achieve this deterrent effect. Perhaps they will be so reliable in 2006. The record provides no basis on which to make such a determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we decline to issue a blanket decision on the propriety of polygraph testing as a tool of supervised release. To the extent York fears that a false positive on a polygraph exam will automatically result in the revocation of his supervised release, the district court has anticipated and addressed his concerns. According to the court's order, \"[n]o violation proceedings will arise based solely on [the] defendant's failure to `pass' the polygraph.\" Given this prophylaxis, the use of a polygraph to promote York's rehabilitation is not per se unreasonable. If, after his supervised release begins, York believes that he has been prejudiced by the unreliability of a polygraph test (or by the burdensomeness of the polygraph regime as administered by the Probation Office), he is free to marshal supporting scientific evidence and petition the district court to modify the conditions of his supervised release. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(2). Until that time, any specific claim of prejudice is premature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Fifth Amendment claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">York's most potent challenge to the mandatory polygraph requirement is that it violates his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. York contends that in the course of his treatment program he will inevitably be asked incriminating questions, and that he will be compelled to answer due to the severe consequences to him of revocation: because his criminal history category is VI, York would face a minimum of eight months in prison if his supervised release were revoked. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 7B1.4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, the United States does not dispute that the Fifth Amendment applies in interviews with probation officers, regardless of whether a polygraph is involved. <i>See Minnesota v. Murphy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111105\"><a href=\"/opinion/111105/minnesota-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">420</span></a></span>, 426, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111105\"><a href=\"/opinion/111105/minnesota-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">409</span></a></span> (1984). Instead, it argues that the mandatory polygraph condition does not on its face \"compel\" York to give incriminating answers. <i>Cf. United States v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109659\"><a href=\"/opinion/109659/united-states-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">181</span></a></span>, 188, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109659\"><a href=\"/opinion/109659/united-states-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Nothing in the Fifth Amendment mitigates the general obligation on probationers to appear and answer questions truthfully. <i>See Murphy,</i> 465 U.S. at 427, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111105\"><a href=\"/opinion/111105/minnesota-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></a></span>. Probation officers may demand honest answers to their questions, just as prosecutors may demand truthful answers from grand jury witnesses subpoenaed to testify. <i>See id.</i> Further, because revocation proceedings are not criminal proceedings, York will not be entitled to refuse to answer questions solely on the ground that his replies may lead to revocation of his supervised release. <i>Id.</i> at 435 n. 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111105\"><a href=\"/opinion/111105/minnesota-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></a></span>. York's probation officers, by requiring him to answer such questions, will not \"compel\" him to incriminate himself within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. <i>See id.</i> at 427-28, 435 n. 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111105\"><a href=\"/opinion/111105/minnesota-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></a></span>. Of course, York will have a valid Fifth Amendment claim if his probation officers ask, and compel him to answer over his assertion of privilege, a particular question implicating him in \"a crime other than that for which he has been convicted.\" <i>Id.</i> at 426, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111105\"><a href=\"/opinion/111105/minnesota-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></a></span>. But York cannot mount a generalized Fifth Amendment attack on the conditions of his supervised release on the ground that he will be required to answer probation officers' questions truthfully.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question, then, is whether the requirement that York submit to polygraph tests during these interviews alters the constitutional analysis. The government says that it does not, arguing that the polygraph merely enforces the general obligation on probationers to answer questions concerning their probationary status truthfully. In the government's view, the polygraph requirement adds nothing relevant to the Fifth Amendment analysis: York might have valid claims of privilege as to particular questions, but the mandatory polygraph condition on its face does not implicate York's Fifth Amendment rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In fact, the polygraph requirement may implicate York's Fifth Amendment rights, depending on how the district court's order is understood. One reading of the release condition is that it flatly requires York to submit to polygraph testing as a condition of his supervised release, so that York's refusal to answer any question &#8212; even on valid Fifth Amendment grounds &#8212; could constitute a basis for revocation. If that reading were intended, it would be constitutionally problematic. The Supreme Court has reasoned:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[I]f the state, either expressly or by implication, asserts that invocation of the privilege would lead to revocation of probation, it would have created the classic penalty situation, the failure to assert the privilege would be excused, and the probationer's answers would be deemed compelled and inadmissible in a criminal prosecution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Murphy,</i> 465 U.S. at 435, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111105\"><a href=\"/opinion/111105/minnesota-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sensitive to Fifth Amendment issues, the district court inserted a caveat in its order: \"When submitting to a polygraph exam, the defendant does not give up his Fifth Amendment rights.\" The government argues that this qualification obviates any concern that the polygraph requirement on its face compels York to incriminate himself. It might well have been intended to do so, but the qualification is ambiguous. The court stated only that York \"does not give up his Fifth Amendment rights\" in submitting to polygraph testing. That could mean (1) that York's supervised release will not be revoked based on his refusal to answer polygraph questions on valid Fifth Amendment grounds; (2) that York must answer every question during his polygraph exams on pain of revocation, but that his answers will not be used against him in any future prosecution; or simply (3) that York will be entitled, in any future prosecution, to seek exclusion of his answers on the grounds that the polygraph procedure forced him to incriminate himself. York objects to the second interpretation because he fears that it is ultra vires: the district court, he says, probably lacks the power to grant him immunity from future prosecutions, state or federal, based on information that he may reveal to his probation officers. And the third interpretation offers him no assurances at all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most sensible interpretation is the first, and we construe the district court's order accordingly. Under <i>Murphy,</i> if York can assert his Fifth Amendment privilege without risking revocation, he does not face a \"classic penalty situation,\" 465 U.S. at 435 &amp; n. 7, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111105\"><a href=\"/opinion/111105/minnesota-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></a></span>, and his answers will not be considered \"compelled\" within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment unless he is forced to answer over his valid assertion of privilege, <i>see id.</i> at 429, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111105\"><a href=\"/opinion/111105/minnesota-v-murphy/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1136</span></a></span>. At oral argument, the government conceded that this is the best interpretation and agreed that it is acceptable; York likewise found it preferable. Construing the order in this way also guarantees that if York and his probation officers dispute whether he refused to answer a question on valid Fifth Amendment grounds, York will be entitled to a hearing before a court before any penalty can be imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We construe the district court's order to provide that York's supervised release shall not be revoked based on his valid assertion of Fifth Amendment privilege during a polygraph examination. So construed, York's sentence, including the special conditions of supervised release, is valid. <i>See United States v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199310\"><a href=\"/opinion/199310/united-states-v-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir.2001) (per curiam) (construing condition of supervised release to avoid Fifth Amendment issues and upholding the sentence as construed). To the extent York raises specific Fifth Amendment objections to incriminating questions that may be asked or coercive tactics that may be employed by the Probation Office, his arguments are premature. York remains free to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege if, after he begins his supervised release term in 2006, such circumstances actually arise. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judgment of the district court is <i>affirmed</i> as construed. <i>So ordered.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In July 2001, following his release from state prison and before his arrest for mailing the letter, York visited A.S. without incident</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The court further prohibited York from possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon, ordered him to participate in a drug testing program as well as a mental health program, barred him from consuming any alcoholic beverages, and prohibited him from identifying himself by anything other than his true name.

Saxena,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199110\"><a href=\"/opinion/199110/united-states-v-saxena/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 5 n. 1 (1st Cir.2000), and the Sentencing Guidelines themselves entrust many correctional decisions to their discretion, <i>see, e.g.,</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(d)(7) (recommending that sex offenders participate in a treatment program \"approved by the United States Probation Office\"). As a practical matter, moreover, many district courts must rely on probation services to ensure the efficient administration of justice in criminal cases. <i>See United States v. Bernardine,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">237</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1279</span></span>, 1283 (11th Cir.2001). For this reason, at least one court of appeals has suggested that delegations like the one in this case are permissible in part because of the unique relationship between probation officers and the district courts. <i>See United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"76239\"><a href=\"/opinion/76239/us-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1280</span></a></span>, 1284 (11th Cir.2003); <i>United States v.
