Lead     petitioner   Jameleddin\n\nAlsamhouri is a Jordanian citizen.       His wife and three children\n\njoin, derivatively, this petition for review of an Immigration\n\nJudge's (IJ's) order denying a continuance to permit Alsamhouri to\n\nfile an application for asylum, and ordering him removed, which was\n\naffirmed by the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA).            There is a\n\none-year time limit to file an application for asylum, subject to\n\ncertain exceptions.     8 U.S.C. ยง 1158(a)(2)(B).\n\n          Alsamhouri     admits   removability,    having   entered   the\n\ncountry on April 13, 2001 and overstayed.         Alsamhouri received a\n\nnotice to appear dated March 12, 2003.    He appeared before an IJ on\n\nJuly 2, 2003 and was given a continuance.          At a master calendar\n\nhearing on April 19, 2004, petitioner appeared with counsel and was\n\ngiven until July 7, 2004 to file applications for asylum and\n\nwithholding of removal.      On May 28, 2004, Alsamhouri's counsel\n\nfiled a motion to withdraw, attaching a copy of a letter he had\n\ngiven to Alsamhouri on May 20, advising of the July 7, 2004 filing\n\ndate and that failure to file the applications on time would\n\nforever bind petitioner.\n\n          At the July 7, 2004 hearing, Alsamhouri appeared but\n\nfiled no application.    Alsamhouri was accompanied by both original\n\ncounsel, who had not yet been given leave to withdraw, and new\n\ncounsel, who stated that Alsamhouri had retained him only a few\n\ndays earlier. Original counsel informed the IJ that soon after the\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fApril 19 master calendar hearing, he received a communication from\n\npetitioner that he had obtained other counsel and no longer needed\n\nthe   services    of   that    original     lawyer.         The    IJ   questioned\n\nAlsamhouri, who testified he never understood there was a deadline\n\nfor filing his applications and that he never received the letter\n\nfrom his counsel advising him of the deadline and the consequences\n\nof not meeting it.      When the IJ pointed out his initials were on\n\nthe letter produced by his first counsel, Alsamhouri switched his\n\ntestimony to admit he received the letter, but then added that he\n\ndid not understand it.        The IJ found him not credible.\n\n           The IJ then deemed Alsamhouri's applications for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture to be withdrawn and abandoned with prejudice.                   Alsamhouri\n\ndeclined to request voluntary departure; the IJ ordered removal to\n\nJordan.\n\n           On November 3, 2005, the BIA affirmed the order of\n\nremoval, without opinion,        8 C.F.R. ยง 1003.1(e)(4).\n\n           Alsamhouri     brought     this       petition    for    review.      He\n\nchallenges the denial of a further continuance as a violation of\n\ndue process and as an abuse of discretion.\n\n           We    acknowledge    the     correctness     of    the    government's\n\nargument that we have no jurisdiction over whether the denial of a\n\ncontinuance      was    an      abuse       of      discretion,         8     U.S.C.\n\nยง 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii); we only address the due process claim.\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\f              That due process claim is not even colorable. The record\n\nsupports the IJ's determination that Alsamhouri was well aware of\n\nthe significance both of the application and of the filing date of\n\nJuly 7, 2004.      As of July 7, 2004, nearly 16 months had elapsed\n\nfrom petitioner's receipt of his notice to appear.              Petitioner had\n\nmore   than    adequate   time    to   obtain   counsel   and    to   file   his\n\napplications.     Indeed, petitioner had had nearly 39 months to file\n\nan application from the time he entered the U.S.\n\n              The record reflects actions by Alsamhouri to delay his\n\nimmigration proceedings and thus string out the time he could\n\nremain in this country.          There was evidence that Alsamhouri told\n\nhis original counsel soon after the April 18 hearing that he had\n\nretained new counsel; and also evidence that he did not in fact\n\nretain new counsel until a few days before the July 7 hearing.\n\nThus, the record does not support the statement in the brief\n\nsubmitted by new counsel that \"the Petitioner did not delay in\n\nhiring an attorney.\"\n\n              On these facts, there is no possible claim that the\n\ndenial of a continuance rendered the proceeding \"fundamentally\n\nunfair.\"      Jobe v. INS, 238 F.3d 96, 98 n.3 (1st Cir. 2001) (en\n\nbanc).\n\n              The petition for review is denied and the order of\n\ndeportation is upheld.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f",
