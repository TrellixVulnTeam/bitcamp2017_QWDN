In this diversity case, appellee\n\nTravelers Indemnity Company of Illinois (\"Travelers\") seeks to\n\nrecover under a motor vehicle liability policy that OneBeacon\n\nAmerica    Insurance    Company    and    Pennsylvania       General       Insurance\n\nCompany     (collectively,      \"OneBeacon\")       had   issued      to      Leasing\n\nAssociates, Inc. and LAI Trust (collectively \"LAI\"), a vehicle\n\nleasing agency.1       Travelers settled a vehicle liability suit for\n\n$5,000,000 on behalf of Capform, Inc., which had leased the vehicle\n\ninvolved from LAI.         Citing the OneBeacon/LAI policy, Travelers\n\ndemanded    that    OneBeacon     reimburse      Travelers    $1,000,000,       the\n\npolicy's limit.      Although OneBeacon has admitted that its policy\n\nwith LAI may be read to extend coverage to the Capform vehicle, it\n\nprotested    that    the   parties       never    intended    such     a    result.\n\nAccordingly, OneBeacon asked the district court to reform the\n\npolicy in light of \"mutual mistake.\"2            On cross-motions for summary\n\njudgment, the district court refused to reform the policy and\n\nordered OneBeacon to pay the $1,000,000 to Travelers.                We reverse.\n\n\n\n\n1\n Travelers is now known as Travelers Property Casualty Company of\nAmerica.\n2\n  OneBeacon’s complaint sought a declaration that the policy at\nissue did not provide coverage for the accident and, alternatively,\nrequested reformation based on mutual mistake.        At least for\npurposes of this appeal, OneBeacon concedes that the policy can be\nread to provide coverage, and it thus focuses only on its claimed\nentitlement to reformation. We likewise focus on that issue.\n\n                                      -2-\n\f                                       I.\n\n              OneBeacon   is   an   insurance   company   headquartered   in\n\nMassachusetts.      LAI, a Texas-based company that leases cars and\n\ntrucks   to    businesses,     contracted   with   OneBeacon   for   general\n\ninsurance coverage for the company's vehicles.3           The policy defines\n\nan “insured” to include:\n\n              a. You for any covered auto.\n              b.   Anyone  else   while  using   with        your\n              permission a covered auto you own . . .\n\nAlthough OneBeacon acknowledges that this language may be read to\n\nextend coverage to LAI’s lessees, it says that neither it nor LAI\n\nintended that coverage.\n\n              Capform, Inc. is a Texas and Florida construction company\n\nthat leased some of its vehicles from LAI.           LAI’s standard lease\n\nrequired lessees to insure the leased vehicles, at their own\n\nexpense, either by applying to be added to the OneBeacon policy or\n\nthrough another insurer. Capform chose to insure its vehicles with\n\nTravelers.      In 2001, a Capform employee in Florida, driving a\n\nCapform truck on long-term lease from LAI, struck and severely\n\ninjured a pedestrian, Manuel Pedreira.          Travelers defended Capform\n\n\n\n3\n   Technically, LAI is covered under two separate policies\noriginally issued by Commercial Union Insurance Company, a\npredecessor-in-interest to OneBeacon, and under a third policy\nissued by Pennsylvania General. OneBeacon provides coverage under\ntwo Massachusetts-specific policies, and Pennsylvania General\nissued a “national” policy, the one at issue here, that covered\neligible vehicles leased from all LAI offices other than the one in\nNeedham, Massachusetts.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fand   eventually   settled    Pedreira's     personal    injury    suit    for\n\n$5,000,000.\n\n           During the settlement process, Travelers became aware of\n\nthe policy OneBeacon had issued to LAI and read it to grant\n\ncoverage   for   Pedreira's   case.       Travelers    asked   OneBeacon    to\n\ncontribute $1,000,000, the policy's single-occurrence limit, to the\n\nPedreira settlement.      OneBeacon refused and instead filed suit\n\nagainst both Travelers and LAI seeking a declaratory judgment that\n\nCapform was not covered by its policy.          Alternatively, OneBeacon\n\nasked that the insurance contract be reformed to match the parties’\n\nintent that it would cover only those lessees who had specifically\n\napplied for, and been approved for, coverage under the OneBeacon\n\npolicy.    LAI was dismissed as a defendant after stating, in an\n\n“Agreement for Judgment” (“the Agreement”), that its OneBeacon\n\npolicy did not cover lessees who purchased the required insurance\n\ncoverage   for   their   leased   vehicles    from    insurers    other   than\n\nOneBeacon.\n\n           Both parties subsequently moved for summary judgment.\n\nOneBeacon argued that the Agreement, taken together with evidence\n\nof the course of conduct between it and LAI, and of the insurance\n\nobligations LAI imposed on its lessees, established that the\n\nparties were mutually mistaken when they executed a contract that\n\ndid not exclude from coverage vehicles that lessees had chosen to\n\ninsure independently.        Travelers sought summary judgment based\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fprimarily on the policy language.\n\n           The district court initially refused to grant judgment\n\nfor either party, prompting the two companies to submit a joint\n\nmotion for reconsideration stating their belief that \"there are no\n\nmaterial facts that require a trial\" and asserting that \"this\n\naction can and should be resolved through [the parties’] Motions\n\nfor Summary Judgment.\"       In response, the district court issued a\n\ntwo-page order granting summary judgment for Travelers, concluding\n\nthat \"OneBeacon has failed to ‘present full, clear, and decisive\n\nproof of mistake.'\"       Dist. Ct. Order at 2 (quoting Polaroid Corp.\n\nv.   Travelers   Indem.    Co.,   610    N.E.2d       912,   917   (Mass.   1993)).\n\nWithout   elaborating,     the    court       cited    three   factors      for   its\n\ndecision: the \"clear and unambiguous policy language,\" OneBeacon's\n\ninability to identify \"any policy language that was included by\n\nmistake . . . or endorsement that was omitted by mistake,\" and \"the\n\nMassachusetts public policy concerning motor-vehicle liability\n\ninsurance.\"\n\n                                        II.\n\n           On appeal, OneBeacon challenges the district court's\n\nconclusion    that   the    evidence          was   insufficient      to    warrant\n\nreformation, arguing that the undisputed facts conclusively show\n\nthat neither OneBeacon nor LAI intended insurance coverage under\n\nthe OneBeacon policy for LAI lessees who did not individually apply\n\nfor, and pay for, that coverage.              The insurer also contends that\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fthere was no public policy justification for refusing to reform the\n\npolicy to conform to the parties' intent.                For reasons we shall\n\nexplain, we agree.\n\nA.   Jurisdiction and standard of review\n\n            The parties agree that the substantive contract law of\n\nMassachusetts applies in this diversity case.                   We accept that\n\nchoice.     See Cochran v. Quest Software, Inc., 328 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).        The district court’s summary judgment ruling is\n\nsubject to de novo review.       McConkie v. Nichols, 446 F.3d 258, 260\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\nB. Mutual mistake and contract reformation under Massachusetts law\n\n            Under   Massachusetts     law,    a    written     contract   may   be\n\nreformed if its language “does not reflect the true intent of both\n\nparties.” Polaroid, 610 N.E.2d at 917; see also Berezin v. Regency\n\nSav. Bank, 234 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir. 2000); John Beaudette, Inc. v.\n\nSentry Ins. A Mut. Co. 94 F. Supp. 2d 77, 142-43 (D. Mass. 1999);\n\nMickelson     v.    Barnet,    460   N.E.2d       566,   569     (Mass.   1984).\n\nMassachusetts courts have referenced the approach to mutual mistake\n\narticulated in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts.                See, e.g.,\n\nNissan Autos. of Marlborough, Inc. v. Glick, 816 N.E.2d 161, 165\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 2004); Howell v. Glassman, 600 N.E.2d 173, 175\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 1992).        The Restatement summarizes the applicable\n\nprinciples as follows:\n\n            Where a writing that evidences or embodies an\n            agreement in whole or in part fails to express\n\n                                     -6-\n\f              the agreement because of a mistake of both\n              parties as to the contents or effect of the\n              writing, the court may at the request of a\n              party reform the writing to express the\n              agreement, except to the extent that rights of\n              third parties such as good faith purchasers\n              for value will be unfairly affected.\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts § 155 (2006).                 When a party asks\n\nfor reformation of a contract, it is not asking the court to\n\ninterpret the contract but rather to change it to conform to the\n\nparties’ intent.         See id. cmts. a, b.             Accordingly, the usual\n\nrestrictions on contract interpretation, such as the parol evidence\n\nrule, do not apply to a court’s inquiry into the parties’ intent.\n\nSee Berezin, 234 F.3d at 72; Polaroid, 610 N.E.2d at 917.                       In a\n\nreformation case, it does not matter that a contract unambiguously\n\nsays one thing.         A court still will accept extrinsic evidence in\n\nevaluating a claim that both parties to the contract intended it to\n\nsay something else.\n\n              The critical limitation in a contract reformation case is\n\nthe burden of proof: to be entitled to reformation, a party must\n\n“establish that the undisputed material facts fully, clearly, and\n\ndecisively show[] a mutual mistake,\" Polaroid, 610 N.E. 2d at 918;\n\nsee   also    Lordi     v.   Lordi,   820    N.E.2d     813,   814    (Mass.   2005).\n\nAlthough “[t]he classic case for reformation” is when the mutual\n\nmistake      can   be   traced   to   a     typo   or   transcription      error,   a\n\nscrivener's error is not a prerequisite for reformation.                    E. Allan\n\nFarnsworth, Farnsworth on Contracts § 7.5 (2001).                    Mutual mistakes\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fjustifying contract reformation may result simply from the parties’\n\ninattention.      See, e.g., Polaroid, 610 N.E.2d at 917 (discussing\n\nmistaken omission of a pollution exclusion from policies); De\n\nVincent Ford Sales, Inc. v. First Mass. Corp., 146 N.E.2d 492, 494\n\n(Mass. 1957) (basis for equitable relief sufficiently set forth\n\nwhere allegations claim mistake resulting from “inadvertence of the\n\nparties”).     Such is the mistake urged by OneBeacon, which claims\n\nthat neither it nor LAI realized – or intended – that the policy’s\n\nbroad definition of an “insured” extended coverage to LAI’s lessees\n\nwho had not independently insured the vehicles with OneBeacon.\n\n            The mistake that OneBeacon must demonstrate – to a high\n\ndegree of certainty – is not that the outcome of its agreement\n\ndiffered from its expectations, but rather that the contract\n\nlanguage did not express the agreement as originally intended. See\n\nRestatement 2d § 155 cmt. a (“The province of reformation is to\n\nmake a writing express the agreement that the parties intended it\n\nshould.”).     The distinction is between a contract that does not\n\naccurately reflect (hence misrepresents) the agreement of the\n\nparties and a contract that accurately reflects the intent of the\n\nparties but is premised on some mistaken fact.       Reformation is not\n\navailable    to   correct   mistaken   factual   assumptions   about   the\n\nparties’ bargain, but may be used to correct misrepresentations of\n\nthe parties’ contractual intent.       The distinction is perhaps best\n\nunderstood through an illustration.       If, for example, two parties\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\fintended their agreement to cover the sale of 100 acres in Boston,\n\nbut the contract erroneously identified a different piece of\n\nproperty in Providence, their mutual mistake could provide the\n\nbasis   for    reformation.      If,    however,   the    contract    correctly\n\nreferred to the intended sale of 100 acres in Boston, but the\n\nparcel turned out to be only 90 acres, the mistake would not\n\nconcern the representation of their intent – and reformation could\n\nnot be used to amend the original agreement.             See Restatement 2d §\n\n155 cmts. a, b.       In short, reformation fixes a mistaken writing; it\n\nis not meant to fix a mistaken agreement.\n\n              Even if a mutual mistake in representation is proven,\n\nhowever, reformation may not necessarily be awarded. \"Since the\n\nremedy of reformation is equitable in nature, a court has the\n\ndiscretion to withhold it . . . on grounds that have traditionally\n\njustified courts of equity in withholding relief.\"              Restatement 2d\n\n§ 155 cmt. d;        see also Howell, 600 N.E.2d at 175; Farnsworth on\n\nContracts, supra, § 7.5.        For example, where the \"rights of third\n\nparties such as good faith purchasers for value will be unfairly\n\naffected,\"      reformation     may    be    withheld    even    if   otherwise\n\nappropriate.        Restatement 2d § 155.\n\nC.   The evidence of mutual mistake\n\n              The   parties   have    both   asserted    that   the   facts   are\n\nundisputed, and Travelers has offered no evidence beyond the policy\n\nlanguage concerning the intent of OneBeacon and LAI at the time\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\fthey entered into that agreement.     Consequently, in reviewing the\n\ngrant of summary judgment for Travelers, our inquiry must focus on\n\nwhether the court properly concluded that the undisputed facts on\n\nintent presented by OneBeacon were insufficient to establish “full,\n\nclear, and decisive proof of mistake,” Polaroid, 610 N.E.2d at 917;\n\nin other words, given the undisputed facts, did the district court\n\nerr in concluding that OneBeacon fell short of meeting the legal\n\nstandard for reformation?\n\n          OneBeacon submitted various forms of evidence, including\n\naffidavits, the Agreement for Judgment, and lease documents that\n\nreflected the course of conduct between LAI and its lessees.\n\nTogether, they paint a consistent picture showing that LAI intended\n\nto shift responsibility for liability coverage on its vehicles to\n\nthe long-term lessees of those vehicles and that OneBeacon also\n\noperated on the assumption that it provided such coverage only when\n\na lessee individually applied and was approved.\n\n          Paragraph 12 of LAI’s standard lease agreement, labeled\n\n“Insurance,” states that “Lessee shall at its sole cost keep each\n\nvehicle insured against liability for bodily injury, death and\n\nproperty damage.”    The provision then goes on to set minimum\n\ncoverage limits and to require that LAI be named as an additional\n\ninsured and the first loss payee, and that the coverage be with\n\ninsurers acceptable to LAI. Paragraph 12 also addresses the option\n\nof obtaining insurance through LAI, “at Lessor’s sole discretion.”\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fIf insurance is so provided, the lessee must agree “to pay the\n\npremium as may from time to time be established by Lessor as\n\nAdditional Rent.”   The record also contains a document entitled\n\n“Lease Supplement – Insurance,” which states that the lessor will\n\nobtain insurance coverage only for specifically identified vehicles\n\nand that the monthly rent payable under the lease may be increased\n\nin the sole discretion of the lessor to cover a premium increase.\n\n          The   logical   inference    from   these   documents   – that\n\ninsurance under LAI’s OneBeacon policy was limited to lessees who\n\nchose that option and paid for it – is reinforced by affidavits\n\nfrom the vice chairman of the insurance brokerage that handled\n\nLAI’s coverage, Jane Calley, and from a OneBeacon underwriter,\n\nWilliam Keen.   Calley explained in detail the process by which LAI\n\nlessees obtained insurance under the OneBeacon policy by applying\n\nthrough her company, Brewer & Lord, and a copy of the application\n\nwas attached to her affidavit.        She reported that none of the\n\napplication procedures had been followed by Capform, and she stated\n\nunequivocally that no coverage was afforded “if the lessee did not\n\napply for insurance, meet the underwriting criteria and receive\n\nacceptance into the LAI Insurance Program.”\n\n          To be approved for coverage, a lessee was required to\n\nprovide Brewer & Lord with information on the driver or drivers and\n\nthe vehicle to be insured, and the broker would check driving\n\nrecords and review vehicle-type information.          Approved vehicles\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fwould be included on lists that LAI provided monthly to Brewer &\n\nLord, and which were then submitted to OneBeacon with premium\n\ncalculations.   Calley said it was her “understanding” that lessees\n\nwere required to complete the lease supplement if approved for\n\ncoverage under the OneBeacon policy.     She further averred that\n\nOneBeacon and LAI\n\n          did not intend that the . . . policies would\n          afford coverage to lessees under long-term\n          lease agreements where the lessee did not\n          apply for such coverage under the LAI\n          Insurance Program, did not meet [OneBeacon’s]\n          underwriting criteria and where the lessee was\n          not accepted for coverage and did not pay a\n          premium for the coverage.\n\n          Keen’s much briefer affidavit repeated Calley’s assertion\n\nthat Capform did not apply for coverage through OneBeacon and also\n\nreiterated that, when the relevant policy was issued, OneBeacon\n\nintended that it would afford coverage only to lessees who had\n\napplied and been approved for coverage. He further stated that, to\n\nthe extent the policy language did not reflect OneBeacon’s intent,\n\n“it was a mistake.”\n\n          Essentially the same representations were contained in\n\nthe Agreement for Judgment between LAI and OneBeacon.   It included\n\nan assertion that lessees were provided coverage through LAI’s\n\npolicies with OneBeacon “only if the lessee executed, in addition\n\nto the Standard Form Lease Agreement, the LEASE SUPPLEMENT –\n\nINSURANCE and a DRIVER APPLICATION, and if the application was\n\naccepted by or on behalf of OneBeacon or Pennsylvania General.”\n\n                               -12-\n\fThe Agreement further stated that Capform executed neither the\n\nlease supplement nor the driver application and that OneBeacon and\n\nPennsylvania General “at no time” undertook to provide coverage to\n\nCapform for the vehicle involved in the Pedreira accident.\n\n              Travelers disparages virtually all of this evidence –\n\nchallenging the basis for the affiants’ knowledge and criticizing\n\nthe “self-serving judgment” against LAI as unworthy of the court’s\n\nconsideration. We note initially that while Travelers properly may\n\ndebate the potency of OneBeacon’s proffered evidence on the issue\n\nof mutual mistake, arguing that it does not constitute “full,\n\nclear, and decisive proof of mistake,” Polaroid, 610 N.E.2d at 917,\n\nTravelers’ representation to the court that no material factual\n\ndisputes      existed   forecloses   it   from   challenging   the   factual\n\nassertions made by the affiants and contained in the Agreement for\n\nJudgment.      Indeed, in keeping with this protocol, Travelers does\n\nnot offer conflicting evidence, but attempts only to diminish the\n\nsignificance of OneBeacon’s offerings.\n\n              In our view, however, the affiants were sufficiently\n\ninvolved in LAI’s acquisition of insurance from OneBeacon to be\n\nconsidered reliable. Calley was a high level administrator for the\n\ninsurance broker, and her statements conveyed a depth of knowledge\n\nabout   the    relevant   coverage   procedures.      She   stated   without\n\nqualification that the LAI insurance program did not provide\n\ncoverage to lessees such as Capform, who had not applied to and\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fbeen approved by OneBeacon.\n\n            Keen likewise had a basis for personal knowledge because\n\nhe oversaw the underwriting of the relevant policy. Given Calley’s\n\nand Keen’s roles, we believe that both affidavits, at least in the\n\nparts relevant here, satisfied the standards of Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(e), which provides that affidavits submitted in support of\n\nsummary judgment must set forth admissible facts based on personal\n\nknowledge.4 Moreover, the affiants’ statements are consistent with\n\nthe undisputed documentary evidence – the standard lease forms –\n\nshowing that LAI and OneBeacon operated in the belief that the\n\npolicy extended only to lessees who specifically applied for\n\ncoverage.\n\n            As for the Agreement for Judgment, Travelers argues in\n\nits brief that the court should not consider any of its content,\n\nclaiming that Travelers cannot be bound by the agreement because it\n\nwas   not   a   party   to   it.   Travelers   further      argues   that    the\n\nAgreement’s content does not constitute admissible evidence by\n\nindividuals     with    personal   knowledge   of   LAI’s    intent,   and   it\n\nemphasizes that the Agreement does not speak to LAI’s intent\n\n\n\n4\n In any event, any objection to our consideration of the affidavits\nhas been waived because Travelers did not move to strike them in\nthe district court, and the exception allowing belated objection to\nprevent “a gross miscarriage of justice” is without question\ninapplicable here. See Perez v. Volvo Car Corp., 247 F.3d 303,\n314-15 (1st Cir. 2001); Casas Office Machs., Inc. v. Mita Copystar\nAm., Inc., 42 F.3d 668, 682 (1st Cir. 1994); Lacey v. Lumber Mut.\nFire Ins.

The Agreement\n\nnevertheless is relevant on the question of the parties’ intent.\n\nLAI is bound by the representations it made in the Agreement, see\n\nBIW Deceived v. Local S6, Indus. Union of Marine And Shipbldg.\n\nWorkers, 132 F.3d 824, 828 (1st Cir. 1997); Coughlin v. Regan, 768\n\nF.2d 468, 469-70 (1st Cir. 1985) (“[A] party to a consent judgment\n\nis thereby deemed to waive any objections it has to matters within\n\nthe scope of the judgment.”),5 and LAI’s assertions about the\n\noperation of its insurance program are – like the supporting\n\ndocuments   –    revealing   on    LAI’s    and   OneBeacon’s     expectations\n\nregarding the policy.\n\n            Travelers also attempts to discredit the Agreement by\n\ndeclaring   in    its   brief     that   “it   stretches   the    boundary   of\n\nbelievability that LAI would agree that too much coverage was\n\nafforded under the polic[y] and that it had an intent to obtain\n\nless coverage than was explicitly afforded under the unambiguous\n\nlanguage . . . .”       We find nothing inherently implausible about\n\nLAI’s declarations, however.             LAI’s representation is that its\n\nleased vehicles were fully insured in ways other than under the\n\n\n5\n  An “agreed judgment” – another name for a consent judgment –\n“binds the parties as fully as other judgments” when it has been\nsanctioned by a judge. Black’s Law Dictionary 858-59 (8th ed.\n2004).   The district court entered an order approving the LAI-\nOneBeacon Agreement.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fpolicy language on which Travelers relies – and, indeed, the\n\nTravelers    coverage    purchased     by   Capform   met    LAI’s   stated\n\nrequirement that lessees insure their vehicles independently if\n\nthey chose not to apply for the OneBeacon coverage.\n\n            In our view, LAI’s lease agreement, particularly when\n\ntaken together with the lease supplement specifically addressing\n\ninsurance, is compelling evidence that LAI intended that its own\n\ninsurance coverage for a particular vehicle would terminate once\n\nthe vehicle was leased.        The process put in place to ensure\n\ncontinuing coverage by the lessee – either through another insurer\n\nor through OneBeacon – supports the inference that OneBeacon also\n\nassumed the policies would cover LAI-owned vehicles after they were\n\nleased only if the requisite application steps had been completed.6\n\nThus, the course of conduct revealed by LAI’s standard forms,\n\ntogether    with   the   elaboration     and   affirmation    provided   by\n\nknowledgeable individuals, persuades us that the parties shared an\n\nintent to exclude vehicles from coverage once they were leased –\n\nunless the lessee followed the requisite procedures for obtaining\n\n\n\n6\n   As noted earlier, a successful application process resulted in\na leased vehicle being included on a monthly list of insured\nvehicles submitted by LAI to Brewer & Lord, which in turn provided\nthe list to OneBeacon. Consistent with that procedure, the policy\ncontained an endorsement amending the definition of “insured” to\ninclude “any person or organization leasing a vehicle or vehicles\nfrom the named insured per monthly report filed with the company.”\nAlthough this endorsement does not by its terms exclude lessees not\non the list, it nonetheless can be read to provide support for\nLAI’s and OneBeacon’s position.\n\n                                  -16-\n\fcoverage under LAI’s policy.\n\n          Travelers has identified no evidence that undermines the\n\nuniform picture painted by OneBeacon’s evidentiary submissions. It\n\nasserts   that   OneBeacon   has    not   pointed   to   “any   specific\n\nendorsement, exclusion or other limiting language that they contend\n\nwas mistakenly omitted when these policies were issued to LAI,”\n\nnoting that “[t]his is hardly surprising, inasmuch as the language\n\nin the policies” providing coverage to specified “insureds” is part\n\nof the boilerplate contained in standard auto industry policies.\n\nHowever, OneBeacon does, in fact, claim a critical omission of\n\nlimiting language that would have excluded from coverage vehicles\n\noperated by long-term lessees who had not directly sought and\n\nobtained coverage under the policy.\n\n          In sum, the evidence submitted by OneBeacon is both\n\nample and persuasive, and we therefore conclude that it has met its\n\nburden to provide “full, clear, and decisive proof of mistake,”\n\nPolaroid, 610 N.E.2d at 917.       Accordingly, barring any equitable\n\nconcerns, OneBeacon is entitled to reformation of the relevant\n\npolicies to exclude coverage for LAI-owned vehicles on long-term\n\nleases, unless the lessee has followed the requisite application\n\nprocedures and obtained its own coverage under the OneBeacon\n\npolicy.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fD. Equitable considerations\n\n            We see no equitable barriers here.             Travelers makes a\n\nstrained argument that reforming the insurance policy as OneBeacon\n\nrequests    would      leave     vehicles     uninsured   in      violation   of\n\nMassachusetts law and public policy. LAI’s general lease form does\n\nnot permit a vehicle to be acquired and operated by a lessee,\n\nhowever, unless the lessee has secured insurance coverage, either\n\nindependently or under LAI’s policy with OneBeacon.               Assuming that\n\nMassachusetts law were to apply to vehicles under long-term lease\n\nthat are registered and operated outside the state, Massachusetts’\n\nrequirement that motor vehicle operators carry liability insurance\n\nwould in no way be frustrated by the OneBeacon/LAI system.\n\n            In addition, the record contains no evidence showing\n\ndetrimental reliance on an assumption that the OneBeacon policy\n\ncovered Capform’s leased vehicles. A representative for Travelers,\n\nShirong Chen, testified in deposition that the company was unaware\n\nof   the   OneBeacon    policy    during     the   underwriting    process    for\n\nCapform, and Capform did not look to OneBeacon for coverage after\n\nthe accident.    From all that appears in the record, this was a case\n\nwhere everyone’s expectations were the same – until Travelers read\n\nthe boilerplate in the OneBeacon policies.                In this instance,\n\nequity favors reforming the policy to reflect the contracting\n\nparties’ intent.\n\n            Therefore, the district court’s summary judgment for\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fappellee Travelers is reversed, and the court is directed to enter\n\nsummary judgment for appellant OneBeacon providing for reformation\n\nof the policy consistent with our ruling.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                              -19-\n\f",

Although OneBeacon has admitted that its policy with LAI may be read to extend coverage to the Capform vehicle, it protested that the parties never intended such a result. Accordingly, OneBeacon asked the district court to reform the policy in light of \"mutual mistake.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court refused to reform the policy and ordered OneBeacon to pay the $1,000,000 to Travelers.

LAI's standard lease required lessees to insure the leased vehicles, at their own expense, either by applying to be added to the OneBeacon policy or through another insurer. Capform chose to insure its vehicles with Travelers. In 2001, a Capform employee in Florida, driving a Capform truck on long-term lease from LAI, struck and severely injured a pedestrian, Manuel Pedreira. Travelers defended Capform and eventually settled Pedreira's personal injury suit for $5,000,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the settlement process, Travelers became aware of the policy OneBeacon had issued to LAI and read it to grant coverage for Pedreira's case. Travelers asked OneBeacon to contribute $1,000,000, the policy's single-occurrence limit, to the Pedreira settlement. OneBeacon refused and instead filed suit against both Travelers and LAI seeking a declaratory judgment that Capform was not covered by its policy. Alternatively, OneBeacon asked that the insurance contract be reformed to match the parties' intent that it would cover only those lessees who had specifically applied for, and been approved for, coverage under the OneBeacon policy. LAI was dismissed as a defendant after stating, in an \"Agreement for Judgment\" (\"the Agreement\"), that its OneBeacon policy did not cover lessees who purchased the required insurance coverage for their leased vehicles from insurers other than OneBeacon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties subsequently moved for summary judgment. OneBeacon argued that the Agreement, taken together with evidence of the course of conduct between it and LAI, and of the insurance obligations LAI imposed on its lessees, established that the parties were mutually mistaken when they executed a contract that did not exclude from coverage vehicles that lessees had chosen to insure independently.

Ct. Order at 2 (quoting <i>Polaroid Corp. v. Travelers Indem. Co.,</i> 414 Mass. 747, 610 N.E.2d 912, 917 (1993)). Without elaborating, the court cited three factors for its decision: the \"clear and unambiguous policy language,\" OneBeacon's inability to identify \"any policy language that was included by mistake . . . or endorsement that was omitted by mistake,\" and \"the Massachusetts public policy concerning motor-vehicle liability insurance.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, OneBeacon challenges the district court's conclusion that the evidence was insufficient to warrant reformation, arguing that the undisputed facts conclusively show that neither OneBeacon nor LAI intended insurance coverage under the OneBeacon policy for LAI lessees who did not individually apply for, and pay for, that coverage. The insurer also contends that there was no public policy justification for refusing to reform the policy to conform to the parties' intent.

Regency Sav. Bank,</i> 234 F.3d 68, 72 (1st Cir.2000); <i>John Beaudette, Inc. v. Sentry Ins. A Mut. Co.</i> 94 F.Supp.2d 77, 142-43 (D.Mass.1999); <i>Mickelson v. Barnet,</i> 390 Mass. 786, 460 N.E.2d 566, 569 (1984). Massachusetts courts have referenced the approach to mutual mistake articulated in the Restatement (Second) of Contracts. See, <i>e.g., Nissan Autos. of Marlborough, Inc. v. Glick,</i> 62 Mass.App.Ct. 302, 816 N.E.2d 161, 165 (2004); <i>Howell v. Glassman,</i> 33 Mass.App.Ct. 349, 600 N.E.2d 173, 175 (1992). The Restatement summarizes the applicable principles as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a writing that evidences or embodies an agreement in whole or in part fails to express the agreement because of a mistake of both parties as to the contents or effect of the writing, the court may at the request of a party reform the writing to express the agreement, except to the extent that rights of third parties such as good faith purchasers for value will be unfairly affected.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 155 (2006). When a party asks for reformation of a contract, it is not asking the court to interpret the contract but rather to change it to conform to the parties' intent. <i>See id.</i> cmts. a, b. Accordingly, the usual restrictions on contract interpretation, such as the parol evidence rule, do not apply to a court's inquiry into the parties' intent. <i>See Berezin,</i> 234 F.3d at 72; <i>Polaroid,</i> 610 N.E.2d at 917. In a reformation case, it does not matter that a contract unambiguously says one thing. A court still will accept extrinsic evidence in evaluating a claim that both parties to the contract intended it to say something else.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The critical limitation in a contract reformation case is the burden of proof: to be entitled to reformation, a party must \"establish that the undisputed material facts fully, clearly, and decisively show[] a mutual mistake,\" <i>Polaroid,</i> 610 N.E.2d at 918; <i>see also Lordi v. Lordi,</i> 443 Mass. 1006, 820 N.E.2d 813, 814 (2005). Although \"[t]he classic case for reformation\" is when the mutual mistake can be traced to a typo or transcription error, a scrivener's error is not a prerequisite for reformation. E. Allan Farnsworth, <i>Farnsworth on Contracts</i> &#167; 7.5 (2001). Mutual mistakes justifying contract reformation may result simply from the parties' inattention. <i>See, e.g., Polaroid,</i> 610 N.E.2d at 917 (discussing mistaken omission of a pollution exclusion from policies); <i>De Vincent Ford Sales, Inc. v. First Mass. Corp.,</i> 336 Mass. 448, 146 N.E.2d 492, 494 (1957) (basis for equitable relief sufficiently set forth where allegations claim mistake resulting from \"inadvertence of the parties\"). Such is the mistake urged by OneBeacon, which claims that neither it nor LAI realized&#8212;or intended&#8212;that the policy's broad definition of an \"insured\" extended coverage to LAI's lessees who had not independently insured the vehicles with OneBeacon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mistake that OneBeacon must demonstrate&#8212;to a high degree of certainty&#8212;is not that the outcome of its agreement differed from its expectations, but rather that the contract language did not express the agreement as originally intended. <i>See</i> Restatement 2d &#167; 155 cmt. a (\"The province of reformation is to make a writing express the agreement that the parties intended it should.\"). The distinction is between a contract that does not accurately reflect (hence misrepresents) the agreement of the parties and a contract that accurately reflects the intent of the parties but is premised on some mistaken fact. Reformation is not available to correct mistaken factual assumptions about the parties' bargain, but may be used to correct misrepresentations of the parties' contractual intent. The distinction is perhaps best understood through an illustration. If, for example, two parties intended their agreement to cover the sale of 100 acres in Boston, but the contract erroneously identified a different piece of property in Providence, their mutual mistake could provide the basis for reformation. If, however, the contract correctly referred to the intended sale of 100 acres in Boston, but the parcel turned out to be only 90 acres, the mistake would not concern the representation of their intent&#8212;and reformation could not be used to amend the original agreement. <i>See</i> Restatement 2d &#167; 155 cmts. a, b. In short, reformation fixes a mistaken writing; it is not meant to fix a mistaken agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if a mutual mistake in representation is proven, however, reformation may not necessarily be awarded. \"Since the remedy of reformation is equitable in nature, a court has the discretion to withhold it . . . on grounds that have traditionally justified courts of equity in withholding relief.\" Restatement 2d &#167; 155 cmt. d; <i>see also Howell,</i> 600 N.E.2d at 175; <i>Farnsworth on Contracts, supra,</i> &#167; 7.5.

Consequently, in reviewing the grant of summary judgment for Travelers, our inquiry must focus on whether the court properly concluded that the undisputed facts on intent presented by OneBeacon were insufficient to establish \"full, clear, and decisive proof of mistake,\" <i>Polaroid,</i> 610 N.E.2d at 917; in other words, given the undisputed facts, did the district court err in concluding that OneBeacon fell short of meeting the legal standard for reformation?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OneBeacon submitted various forms of evidence, including affidavits, the Agreement for Judgment, and lease documents that reflected the course of conduct between LAI and its lessees. Together, they paint a consistent picture showing that LAI intended to shift responsibility for liability coverage on its vehicles to the long-term lessees of those vehicles and that OneBeacon also operated on the assumption that it provided such coverage only when a lessee individually applied and was approved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 12 of LAI's standard lease agreement, labeled \"Insurance,\" states that \"Lessee shall at its sole cost keep each vehicle insured against liability for bodily injury, death and property damage.\" The provision then goes on to set minimum coverage limits and to require that LAI be named as an additional insured and the first loss payee, and that the coverage be with insurers acceptable to LAI. Paragraph 12 also addresses the option of obtaining insurance through LAI, \"at Lessor's sole discretion.\" If insurance is so provided, the lessee must agree \"to pay the premium as may from time to time be established by Lessor as Additional Rent.\" The record also contains a document entitled \"Lease Supplement&#8212;Insurance,\" which states that the lessor will obtain insurance coverage only for specifically identified vehicles and that the monthly rent payable under the lease may be increased in the sole discretion of the lessor to cover a premium increase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The logical inference from these documents&#8212;that insurance under LAI's OneBeacon policy was limited to lessees who chose that option and paid for it&#8212;is reinforced by affidavits from the vice chairman of the insurance brokerage that handled LAI's coverage, Jane Calley, and from a OneBeacon underwriter, William Keen. Calley explained in detail the process by which LAI lessees obtained insurance under the OneBeacon policy by applying through her company, Brewer &amp; Lord, and a copy of the application was attached to her affidavit. She reported that none of the application procedures had been followed by Capform, and she stated unequivocally that no coverage was afforded \"if the lessee did not apply for insurance, meet the underwriting criteria and receive acceptance into the LAI Insurance Program.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be approved for coverage, a lessee was required to provide Brewer &amp; Lord with information on the driver or drivers and the vehicle to be insured, and the broker would check driving records and review vehicle-type information. Approved vehicles would be included on lists that LAI provided monthly to Brewer &amp; Lord, and which were then submitted to OneBeacon with premium calculations. Calley said it was her \"understanding\" that lessees were required to complete the lease supplement if approved for coverage under the OneBeacon policy. She further averred that OneBeacon and LAI</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">did not intend that the . . . policies would afford coverage to lessees under long-term lease agreements where the lessee did not apply for such coverage under the LAI Insurance Program, did not meet [OneBeacon's] underwriting criteria and where the lessee was not accepted for coverage and did not pay a premium for the coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keen's much briefer affidavit repeated Calley's assertion that Capform did not apply for coverage through OneBeacon and also reiterated that, when the relevant policy was issued, OneBeacon intended that it would afford coverage only to lessees who had applied and been approved for coverage. He further stated that, to the extent the policy language did not reflect OneBeacon's intent, \"it was a mistake.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Essentially the same representations were contained in the Agreement for Judgment between LAI and OneBeacon. It included an assertion that lessees were provided coverage through LAI's policies with OneBeacon \"only if the lessee executed, in addition to the Standard Form Lease Agreement, the LEASE SUPPLEMENT&#8212;INSURANCE and a DRIVER APPLICATION, and if the application was accepted by or on behalf of OneBeacon or Pennsylvania General.\" The Agreement further stated that Capform executed neither the lease supplement nor the driver application and that OneBeacon and Pennsylvania General \"at no time\" undertook to provide coverage to Capform for the vehicle involved in the Pedreira accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers disparages virtually all of this evidence&#8212;challenging the basis for the affiants' knowledge and criticizing the \"self-serving judgment\" against LAI as unworthy of the court's consideration. We note initially that while Travelers properly may debate the potency of OneBeacon's proffered evidence on the issue of mutual mistake, arguing that it does not constitute \"full, clear, and decisive proof of mistake,\" <i>Polaroid,</i> 610 N.E.2d at 917, Travelers' representation to the court that no material factual disputes existed forecloses it from challenging the factual assertions made by the affiants and contained in the Agreement for Judgment. Indeed, in keeping with this protocol, Travelers does not offer conflicting evidence, but attempts only to diminish the significance of OneBeacon's offerings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, however, the affiants were sufficiently involved in LAI's acquisition of insurance from OneBeacon to be considered reliable. Calley was a high level administrator for the insurance broker, and her statements conveyed a depth of knowledge about the relevant coverage procedures. She stated without qualification that the LAI insurance program did not provide coverage to lessees such as Capform, who had not applied to and been approved by OneBeacon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keen likewise had a basis for personal knowledge because he oversaw the underwriting of the relevant policy. Given Calley's and Keen's roles, we believe that both affidavits, at least in the parts relevant here, satisfied the standards of Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e), which provides that affidavits submitted in support of summary judgment must set forth admissible facts based on personal knowledge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Moreover, the affiants' statements are consistent with the undisputed documentary evidence&#8212; the standard lease forms&#8212;showing that LAI and OneBeacon operated in the belief that the policy extended only to lessees who specifically applied for coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the Agreement for Judgment, Travelers argues in its brief that the court should not consider any of its content, claiming that Travelers cannot be bound by the agreement because it was not a party to it. Travelers further argues that the Agreement's content does not constitute admissible evidence by individuals with personal knowledge of LAI's intent, and it emphasizes that the Agreement does not speak to LAI's intent concerning coverage at the time it obtained the policy at issue. Travelers' argument that it is not \"bound\" by the statements contained in the Agreement is beside the point. The Agreement nevertheless is relevant on the question of the parties' intent. LAI <i>is</i> bound by the representations it made in the Agreement, <i>see BIW Deceived v. Local S6, Indus. Union of Marine And Shipbldg. Workers,</i> 132 F.3d 824, 828 (1st Cir.1997); <i>Coughlin v. Regan,</i> 768 F.2d 468, 469-70 (1st Cir.1985) (\"[A] party to a consent judgment is thereby deemed to waive any objections it has to matters within the scope of the judgment.\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> and LAI's assertions about the operation of its insurance program are&#8212;like the supporting documents&#8212;revealing on LAI's and OneBeacon's expectations regarding the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers also attempts to discredit the Agreement by declaring in its brief that \"it stretches the boundary of believability that LAI would agree that too much coverage was afforded under the polic[y] and that it had an intent to obtain less coverage than was explicitly afforded under the unambiguous language . . . .\" We find nothing inherently implausible about LAI's declarations, however. LAI's representation is that its leased vehicles were fully insured in ways other than under the policy language on which Travelers relies&#8212;and, indeed, the Travelers coverage purchased by Capform met LAI's stated requirement that lessees insure their vehicles independently if they chose not to apply for the OneBeacon coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, LAI's lease agreement, particularly when taken together with the lease supplement specifically addressing insurance, is compelling evidence that LAI intended that its own insurance coverage for a particular vehicle would terminate once the vehicle was leased. The process put in place to ensure continuing coverage by the lessee&#8212;either through another insurer or through OneBeacon&#8212;supports the inference that OneBeacon also assumed the policies would cover LAI-owned vehicles after they were leased only if the requisite application steps had been completed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Thus, the course of conduct revealed by LAI's standard forms, together with the elaboration and affirmation provided by knowledgeable individuals, persuades us that the parties shared an intent to exclude vehicles from coverage once they were leased&#8212;unless the lessee followed the requisite procedures for obtaining coverage under LAI's policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers has identified no evidence that undermines the uniform picture painted by OneBeacon's evidentiary submissions. It asserts that OneBeacon has not pointed to \"any specific endorsement, exclusion or other limiting language that they contend was mistakenly omitted when these policies were issued to LAI,\" noting that \"[t]his is hardly surprising, inasmuch as the language in the policies\" providing coverage to specified \"insureds\" is part of the boilerplate contained in standard auto industry policies. However, OneBeacon does, in fact, claim a critical omission of limiting language that would have excluded from coverage vehicles operated by long-term lessees who had not directly sought and obtained coverage under the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the evidence submitted by OneBeacon is both ample and persuasive, and we therefore conclude that it has met its burden to provide \"full, clear, and decisive proof of mistake,\" <i>Polaroid,</i> 610 N.E.2d at 917. Accordingly, barring any equitable concerns, OneBeacon is entitled to reformation of the relevant policies to exclude coverage for LAI-owned vehicles on long-term leases, unless the lessee has followed the requisite application procedures and obtained its own coverage under the OneBeacon policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Equitable considerations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no equitable barriers here. Travelers makes a strained argument that reforming the insurance policy as OneBeacon requests would leave vehicles uninsured in violation of Massachusetts law and public policy. LAI's general lease form does not permit a vehicle to be acquired and operated by a lessee, however, unless the lessee has secured insurance coverage, either independently or under LAI's policy with OneBeacon. Assuming that Massachusetts law were to apply to vehicles under long-term lease that are registered and operated outside the state, Massachusetts' requirement that motor vehicle operators carry liability insurance would in no way be frustrated by the OneBeacon/LAI system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the record contains no evidence showing detrimental reliance on an assumption that the OneBeacon policy covered Capform's leased vehicles. A representative for Travelers, Shirong Chen, testified in deposition that the company was unaware of the OneBeacon policy during the underwriting process for Capform, and Capform did not look to OneBeacon for coverage after the accident. From all that appears in the record, this was a case where everyone's expectations were the same&#8212;until Travelers read the boilerplate in the OneBeacon policies. In this instance, equity favors reforming the policy to reflect the contracting parties' intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Therefore, the district court's summary judgment for appellee Travelers is reversed, and the court is directed to enter summary judgment for appellant OneBeacon providing for reformation of the policy consistent with our ruling.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Travelers is now known as Travelers Property Casualty Company of America</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> OneBeacon's complaint sought a declaration that the policy at issue did not provide coverage for the accident and, alternatively, requested reformation based on mutual mistake.

Although OneBeacon has admitted that its policy with LAI may be read to extend coverage to the Capform vehicle, it protested that the parties never intended such a result. Accordingly, OneBeacon asked the district court to reform the policy in light of \"mutual mistake.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On cross-motions for summary judgment, the district court refused to reform the policy and ordered OneBeacon to pay the $1,000,000 to Travelers.

LAI's standard lease required lessees to insure the leased vehicles, at their own expense, either by applying to be added to the OneBeacon policy or through another insurer. Capform chose to insure its vehicles with Travelers. In 2001, a Capform employee in Florida, driving a Capform truck on long-term lease from LAI, struck and severely injured a pedestrian, Manuel Pedreira. Travelers defended Capform and eventually settled Pedreira's personal injury suit for $5,000,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the settlement process, Travelers became aware of the policy OneBeacon had issued to LAI and read it to grant coverage for Pedreira's case. Travelers asked OneBeacon to contribute $1,000,000, the policy's single-occurrence limit, to the Pedreira settlement. OneBeacon refused and instead filed suit against both Travelers and LAI seeking a declaratory judgment that Capform was not covered by its policy. Alternatively, OneBeacon asked that the insurance contract be reformed to match the parties' intent that it would cover only those lessees who had specifically applied for, and been approved for, coverage under the OneBeacon policy. LAI was dismissed as a defendant after stating, in an \"Agreement for Judgment\" (\"the Agreement\"), that its OneBeacon policy did not cover lessees who purchased the required insurance coverage for their leased vehicles from insurers other than OneBeacon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both parties subsequently moved for summary judgment. OneBeacon argued that the Agreement, taken together with evidence of the course of conduct between it and LAI, and of the insurance obligations LAI imposed on its lessees, established that the parties were mutually mistaken when they executed a contract that did not exclude from coverage vehicles that lessees had chosen to insure independently.

When a party asks for reformation of a contract, it is not asking the court to interpret the contract but rather to change it to conform to the parties' intent. <i>See id.</i> cmts. a, b. Accordingly, the usual restrictions on contract interpretation, such as the parol evidence rule, do not apply to a court's inquiry into the parties' intent. <i>See Berezin,</i> 234 F.3d at 72; <i>Polaroid,</i> 610 N.E.2d at 917.

Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2037838\"><a href=\"/opinion/2037838/devincent-ford-sales-inc-v-first-mass-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">336</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2037838\"><a href=\"/opinion/2037838/devincent-ford-sales-inc-v-first-mass-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 494 (1957) (basis for equitable relief sufficiently set forth where allegations claim mistake resulting from \"inadvertence of the parties\"). Such is the mistake urged by OneBeacon, which claims that neither it nor LAI realized&#8212;or intended&#8212;that the policy's broad definition of an \"insured\" extended coverage to LAI's lessees who had not independently insured the vehicles with OneBeacon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mistake that OneBeacon must demonstrate&#8212;to a high degree of certainty&#8212;is not that the outcome of its agreement differed from its expectations, but rather that the contract language did not express the agreement as originally intended. <i>See</i> Restatement 2d &#167; 155 cmt. a (\"The province of reformation is to make a writing express the agreement that the parties intended it should.\"). The distinction is between a contract that does not accurately reflect (hence misrepresents) the agreement of the parties and a contract that accurately reflects the intent of the parties but is premised on some mistaken fact. Reformation is not available to correct mistaken factual assumptions about the parties' bargain, but may be used to correct misrepresentations of the parties' contractual intent. The distinction is perhaps best understood through an illustration. If, for example, two parties intended their agreement to cover the sale of 100 acres in Boston, but the contract erroneously identified a different piece of property in Providence, their mutual mistake could provide the basis for reformation. If, however, the contract correctly referred to the intended sale of 100 acres in Boston, but the parcel turned out to be only 90 acres, the mistake would not concern the representation of their intent&#8212;and reformation could not be used to amend the original agreement. <i>See</i> Restatement 2d &#167; 155 cmts. a, b. In short, reformation fixes a mistaken writing; it is not meant to fix a mistaken agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if a mutual mistake in representation is proven, however, reformation may not necessarily be awarded. \"Since the remedy of reformation is equitable in nature, a court has the discretion to withhold it . . . on grounds that have traditionally justified courts of equity in withholding relief.\" Restatement 2d &#167; 155 cmt. d; <i>see also Howell,</i> 600 N.E.2d at 175; <i>Farnsworth on Contracts, supra,</i> &#167; 7.5. For example, where the \"rights of third parties such as good faith purchasers for value will be unfairly affected,\" reformation may be withheld even if otherwise appropriate. Restatement 2d &#167; 155.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The evidence of mutual mistake</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties have both asserted that the facts are undisputed, and Travelers has offered no evidence beyond the policy language concerning the intent of OneBeacon and LAI at the time they entered into that agreement. Consequently, in reviewing the grant of summary judgment for Travelers, our inquiry must focus on whether the court properly concluded that the undisputed facts on intent presented by OneBeacon were insufficient to establish \"full, clear, and decisive proof of mistake,\" <i>Polaroid,</i> 610 N.E.2d at 917; in other words, given the undisputed facts, did the district court err in concluding that OneBeacon fell short of meeting the legal standard for reformation?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">OneBeacon submitted various forms of evidence, including affidavits, the Agreement for Judgment, and lease documents that reflected the course of conduct between LAI and its lessees. Together, they paint a consistent picture showing that LAI intended to shift responsibility for liability coverage on its vehicles to the long-term lessees of those vehicles and that OneBeacon also operated on the assumption that it provided such coverage only when a lessee individually applied and was approved.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Paragraph 12 of LAI's standard lease agreement, labeled \"Insurance,\" states that \"Lessee shall at its sole cost keep each vehicle insured against liability for bodily injury, death and property damage.\" The provision then goes on to set minimum coverage limits and to require that LAI be named as an additional insured and the first loss payee, and that the coverage be with insurers acceptable to LAI. Paragraph 12 also addresses the option of obtaining insurance through LAI, \"at Lessor's sole discretion.\" If insurance is so provided, the lessee must agree \"to pay the premium as may from time to time be established by Lessor as Additional Rent.\" The record also contains a document entitled \"Lease Supplement&#8212;Insurance,\" which states that the lessor will obtain insurance coverage only for specifically identified vehicles and that the monthly rent payable under the lease may be increased in the sole discretion of the lessor to cover a premium increase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The logical inference from these documents&#8212;that insurance under LAI's OneBeacon policy was limited to lessees who chose that option and paid for it&#8212;is reinforced by affidavits from the vice chairman of the insurance brokerage that handled LAI's coverage, Jane Calley, and from a OneBeacon underwriter, William Keen. Calley explained in detail the process by which LAI lessees obtained insurance under the OneBeacon policy by applying through her company, Brewer &amp; Lord, and a copy of the application was attached to her affidavit. She reported that none of the application procedures had been followed by Capform, and she stated unequivocally that no coverage was afforded \"if the lessee did not apply for insurance, meet the underwriting criteria and receive acceptance into the LAI Insurance Program.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be approved for coverage, a lessee was required to provide Brewer &amp; Lord with information on the driver or drivers and the vehicle to be insured, and the broker would check driving records and review vehicle-type information. Approved vehicles would be included on lists that LAI provided monthly to Brewer &amp; Lord, and which were then submitted to OneBeacon with premium calculations. Calley said it was her \"understanding\" that lessees were required to complete the lease supplement if approved for coverage under the OneBeacon policy. She further averred that OneBeacon and LAI</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">did not intend that the . . . policies would afford coverage to lessees under long-term lease agreements where the lessee did not apply for such coverage under the LAI Insurance Program, did not meet [OneBeacon's] underwriting criteria and where the lessee was not accepted for coverage and did not pay a premium for the coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keen's much briefer affidavit repeated Calley's assertion that Capform did not apply for coverage through OneBeacon and also reiterated that, when the relevant policy was issued, OneBeacon intended that it would afford coverage only to lessees who had applied and been approved for coverage. He further stated that, to the extent the policy language did not reflect OneBeacon's intent, \"it was a mistake.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Essentially the same representations were contained in the Agreement for Judgment between LAI and OneBeacon. It included an assertion that lessees were provided coverage through LAI's policies with OneBeacon \"only if the lessee executed, in addition to the Standard Form Lease Agreement, the LEASE SUPPLEMENT&#8212;INSURANCE and a DRIVER APPLICATION, and if the application was accepted by or on behalf of OneBeacon or Pennsylvania General.\" The Agreement further stated that Capform executed neither the lease supplement nor the driver application and that OneBeacon and Pennsylvania General \"at no time\" undertook to provide coverage to Capform for the vehicle involved in the Pedreira accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers disparages virtually all of this evidence&#8212;challenging the basis for the affiants' knowledge and criticizing the \"self-serving judgment\" against LAI as unworthy of the court's consideration. We note initially that while Travelers properly may debate the potency of OneBeacon's proffered evidence on the issue of mutual mistake, arguing that it does not constitute \"full, clear, and decisive proof of mistake,\" <i>Polaroid,</i> 610 N.E.2d at 917, Travelers' representation to the court that no material factual disputes existed forecloses it from challenging the factual assertions made by the affiants and contained in the Agreement for Judgment. Indeed, in keeping with this protocol, Travelers does not offer conflicting evidence, but attempts only to diminish the significance of OneBeacon's offerings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, however, the affiants were sufficiently involved in LAI's acquisition of insurance from OneBeacon to be considered reliable. Calley was a high level administrator for the insurance broker, and her statements conveyed a depth of knowledge about the relevant coverage procedures. She stated without qualification that the LAI insurance program did not provide coverage to lessees such as Capform, who had not applied to and been approved by OneBeacon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Keen likewise had a basis for personal knowledge because he oversaw the underwriting of the relevant policy. Given Calley's and Keen's roles, we believe that both affidavits, at least in the parts relevant here, satisfied the standards of Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e), which provides that affidavits submitted in support of summary judgment must set forth admissible facts based on personal knowledge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Moreover, the affiants' statements are consistent with the undisputed documentary evidence&#8212; the standard lease forms&#8212;showing that LAI and OneBeacon operated in the belief that the policy extended only to lessees who specifically applied for coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for the Agreement for Judgment, Travelers argues in its brief that the court should not consider any of its content, claiming that Travelers cannot be bound by the agreement because it was not a party to it. Travelers further argues that the Agreement's content does not constitute admissible evidence by individuals with personal knowledge of LAI's intent, and it emphasizes that the Agreement does not speak to LAI's intent concerning coverage at the time it obtained the policy at issue. Travelers' argument that it is not \"bound\" by the statements contained in the Agreement is beside the point. The Agreement nevertheless is relevant on the question of the parties' intent. LAI <i>is</i> bound by the representations it made in the Agreement, <i>see BIW Deceived v. Local S6, Indus. Union of Marine And Shipbldg. Workers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"749863\"><a href=\"/opinion/749863/biw-deceived-v-local-s6-industrial-union-of-marine-and-shipbuilding/\"><span class=\"volume\">132</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">824</span></a></span>, 828 (1st Cir.1997); <i>Coughlin v.

LAI's representation is that its leased vehicles were fully insured in ways other than under the policy language on which Travelers relies&#8212;and, indeed, the Travelers coverage purchased by Capform met LAI's stated requirement that lessees insure their vehicles independently if they chose not to apply for the OneBeacon coverage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our view, LAI's lease agreement, particularly when taken together with the lease supplement specifically addressing insurance, is compelling evidence that LAI intended that its own insurance coverage for a particular vehicle would terminate once the vehicle was leased. The process put in place to ensure continuing coverage by the lessee&#8212;either through another insurer or through OneBeacon&#8212;supports the inference that OneBeacon also assumed the policies would cover LAI-owned vehicles after they were leased only if the requisite application steps had been completed.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Thus, the course of conduct revealed by LAI's standard forms, together with the elaboration and affirmation provided by knowledgeable individuals, persuades us that the parties shared an intent to exclude vehicles from coverage once they were leased&#8212;unless the lessee followed the requisite procedures for obtaining coverage under LAI's policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Travelers has identified no evidence that undermines the uniform picture painted by OneBeacon's evidentiary submissions. It asserts that OneBeacon has not pointed to \"any specific endorsement, exclusion or other limiting language that they contend was mistakenly omitted when these policies were issued to LAI,\" noting that \"[t]his is hardly surprising, inasmuch as the language in the policies\" providing coverage to specified \"insureds\" is part of the boilerplate contained in standard auto industry policies. However, OneBeacon does, in fact, claim a critical omission of limiting language that would have excluded from coverage vehicles operated by long-term lessees who had not directly sought and obtained coverage under the policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the evidence submitted by OneBeacon is both ample and persuasive, and we therefore conclude that it has met its burden to provide \"full, clear, and decisive proof of mistake,\" <i>Polaroid,</i> 610 N.E.2d at 917. Accordingly, barring any equitable concerns, OneBeacon is entitled to reformation of the relevant policies to exclude coverage for LAI-owned vehicles on long-term leases, unless the lessee has followed the requisite application procedures and obtained its own coverage under the OneBeacon policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Equitable considerations</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We see no equitable barriers here. Travelers makes a strained argument that reforming the insurance policy as OneBeacon requests would leave vehicles uninsured in violation of Massachusetts law and public policy. LAI's general lease form does not permit a vehicle to be acquired and operated by a lessee, however, unless the lessee has secured insurance coverage, either independently or under LAI's policy with OneBeacon. Assuming that Massachusetts law were to apply to vehicles under long-term lease that are registered and operated outside the state, Massachusetts' requirement that motor vehicle operators carry liability insurance would in no way be frustrated by the OneBeacon/LAI system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, the record contains no evidence showing detrimental reliance on an assumption that the OneBeacon policy covered Capform's leased vehicles. A representative for Travelers, Shirong Chen, testified in deposition that the company was unaware of the OneBeacon policy during the underwriting process for Capform, and Capform did not look to OneBeacon for coverage after the accident. From all that appears in the record, this was a case where everyone's expectations were the same&#8212;until Travelers read the boilerplate in the OneBeacon policies. In this instance, equity favors reforming the policy to reflect the contracting parties' intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Therefore, the district court's summary judgment for appellee Travelers is reversed, and the court is directed to enter summary judgment for appellant OneBeacon providing for reformation of the policy consistent with our ruling.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>So ordered.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Travelers is now known as Travelers Property Casualty Company of America</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> OneBeacon's complaint sought a declaration that the policy at issue did not provide coverage for the accident and, alternatively, requested reformation based on mutual mistake. At least for purposes of this appeal, OneBeacon concedes that the policy can be read to provide coverage, and it thus focuses only on its claimed entitlement to reformation. We likewise focus on that issue</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Technically, LAI is covered under two separate policies originally issued by Commercial Union Insurance Company, a predecessor-in-interest to OneBeacon, and under a third policy issued by Pennsylvania General.
