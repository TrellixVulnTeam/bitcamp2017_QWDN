R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                       For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 04-2112\n\n                          PETER D.

Joseph A. DiClerico, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n              Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges,\n               and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Peter D. Prevett on brief pro se.\n     Kelly A. Ayotte, Attorney General, and Daniel J. Mullen,\nAssociate Attorney General, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          February 15, 2005\n\f          Per Curiam.    In this appeal, pro se appellant Peter\n\nPrevett appeals from a district court judgment dismissing his\n\nsuit, which challenged, on equal protection grounds, the facial\n\nvalidity of a state bar admission rule, N.H. Sup. Ct. R.\n\n42(10)(a)(ii), and the state supreme court's reliance on the\n\nrule to deny his application for admission to the bar.     In an\n\norder dated May 26, 2004, the district court dismissed the\n\nchallenge to the state court's denial of the appellant's bar\n\napplication based on the Rooker-Feldman doctrine.    In an order\n\ndated August 4, 2004, the court rejected the challenge to the\n\nfacial validity of the rule, finding that there was no equal\n\nprotection violation because the rule is rationally related to\n\na legitimate state interest.         After careful review of the\n\nrecord and the appellate filings, we affirm, essentially for\n\nthe reasons given by the district court in its thoughtful\n\ndecisions.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -2-\n\f",
