José A. Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                       Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Selya, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Rafael Oliveras López de Victoria pro se.\n\n\n\n                           March 17, 2009\n\f             PER CURIAM.        This case concerns the suspension of an\n\nattorney from the practice of law in two consolidated reciprocal\n\ndiscipline matters.\n\n             On January 24, 2008, the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico\n\nindefinitely suspended attorney Rafael Oliveras López de Victoria\n\nfrom the practice of law, finding he had violated Rules 35 and 38\n\nof the Puerto Rico Professional Ethics Code.            In re Oliveras López\n\nde Victoria, 2008 TSPR 15 (P.R. 2008) (per curiam). The suspension\n\nwas based on findings that Oliveras López de Victoria had filed a\n\nmotion in a lawsuit to withdraw funds consigned in a lower court\n\nfor a client without mentioning his knowledge that his client had\n\ndied, which was a material fact.                Oliveras López de Victoria\n\nattempted to have the court issue two checks: one in favor of his\n\ndeceased client and another in his name.            The Supreme Court found\n\nthat    he   had   tried   to   mislead   the   lower   court   and   that   his\n\nmotivation was to collect his attorney's fees.             Oliveras López de\n\nVictoria was also found to have lied to the lower court by stating\n\nthat there were no minors involved in the case, even though he had\n\nlisted such a minor in an earlier inheritance action.\n\n             Eventually, Oliveras López de Victoria disclosed to the\n\nlower court judge the death of his client and that there was a\n\nminor involved.      Confronted by that judge with his misstatements,\n\nhe did not deny making the misstatements, but attempted to excuse\n\nthem.\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f            Thereafter the Puerto Rico Attorney General filed a\n\ndisciplinary complaint with the Supreme Court, which appointed a\n\nSpecial Commissioner to receive evidence and submit a report.                        The\n\nSupreme Court relied upon the facts of record and that report.\n\n            The Supreme Court found Oliveras López de Victoria had\n\nknowingly violated the Professional Ethics Code and rejected his\n\njustification    that   this     was    a   result   of    mere       error    and   his\n\nmitigation argument that he had been in poor health.                          The court\n\nnoted    that   Oliveras      López    de   Victoria      had     used      groundless\n\nallegations before the Special Commissioner that his signature was\n\nforged in an attempt to avoid the consequences of the disciplinary\n\nproceeding.     In light of the facts and considering that respondent\n\nhad had prior disciplinary action taken against him, the court\n\nsuspended him indefinitely from the practice of law.\n\n            On May 27, 2008, the U.S. District Court for the District\n\nof Puerto Rico, under its reciprocal discipline procedures, see\n\nD.P.R.    R.    83.5(j),      suspended       Oliveras     López       de      Victoria\n\nindefinitely. The order stated that he would remain suspended from\n\nthe bar of the district court \"until the Supreme Court of Puerto\n\nRico    reinstate[d]    him    to     the   practice      of    law    or     otherwise\n\nmodifie[d] the indefinite suspension.\"\n\n            On July 11, 2008, we ordered Oliveras López de Victoria\n\nto show cause why he should not similarly be disciplined before\n\nthis court.     He responded by filing a brief and an appendix.                      He\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fwas required to provide English translations of documents in his\n\nappendix.   In January 2009, he filed a supplemental brief with the\n\ntranslated documents.\n\n            Before us is both Oliveras López de Victoria's appeal\n\nfrom the district court order of suspension and his response to the\n\norder to show cause from this court.     We heard oral argument from\n\nOliveras López de Victoria on March 2, 2009.\n\n            Oliveras López de Victoria argues that his due process\n\nrights in his disciplinary proceedings in the Puerto Rican court\n\nwere violated.    The purported violation is based on his argument\n\nthat the Puerto Rico Supreme Court was required in 2005 to grant\n\nhis motion to appoint a handwriting expert, and that if the court\n\nhad done so, the expert would have concluded that the signature on\n\nthe August 9, 2001 motion filed in the lower court was not his.\n\nFurthermore, Oliveras López de Victoria claims his right to due\n\nprocess was violated when the Supreme Court refused to reopen the\n\ndisciplinary proceedings after he later submitted to it reports\n\nfrom an expert calligrapher, dated February 6, 2008 and September\n\n19, 2008, which stated the signature on the motion in the lower\n\ncourt was a forgery.\n\n            He also asks that this court disagree with the conclusion\n\nof the Puerto Rico Supreme Court that the evidence he provided in\n\nmitigation did not warrant imposition of a lesser discipline.    The\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fmitigating     evidence   was   that    he    was   very   ill   and   frequently\n\nhospitalized at the relevant times.\n\n           Oliveras López de Victoria also makes various arguments\n\nthat the Puerto Rico court overstated the factual findings, that\n\nhis errors were not grave, and that the sanctions imposed were not\n\ncommensurate with the discipline imposed in similar cases before\n\nthe Puerto Rico Supreme Court or the U.S. District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico.        We have considered his arguments.\n\n           Our standards for imposing reciprocal discipline are\n\nclear and are set forth in In Re Williams, 398 F.3d 116 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (per curiam). \"As a general rule, discipline similar to that\n\nimposed   in   the   state   court     will   be    imposed   in   a   reciprocal\n\nproceeding,\" unless this court is persuaded\n\n           1. that the procedure used by the other court\n           was so lacking in notice or opportunity to be\n           heard as to constitute a deprivation of due\n           process; or\n           2. that there was such an infirmity of proof\n           establishing the misconduct as to give rise to\n           the clear conviction that this Court could\n           not, consistent with its duty, accept as final\n           the conclusion on that subject; or\n           3.    that the imposition of substantially\n           similar discipline by this Court would result\n           in grave injustice; or\n           4. that the misconduct established is deemed\n           by the Court to warrant different discipline.\n\nId. at 119 (quoting 1st Cir. R. Att'y Discip. Enf. (Discip. R.)\n\nII.C); see also Fed. R. App. P. 46(b)(1)(A).\n\n           Moreover,\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f          [w]here . . . action against an attorney is\n          based on the imposition of discipline by a\n          state court, the ultimate decision of the\n          state court as to the type and kind of\n          discipline meted out is \"not conclusively\n          binding\" on this court.    Nevertheless, this\n          court is without jurisdiction, in a federal\n          disciplinary proceeding, to disturb the state\n          court's imposition of discipline, and the\n          state court's substantive findings ordinarily\n          are entitled to a high degree of respect when\n          this court is asked to impose reciprocal\n          discipline.\n\nIn re Williams, 398 F.3d at 118 (citations omitted) (quoting In re\n\nRuffalo, 390 U.S. 544, 547 (1968)).\n\n          Ultimately, the burden is on Oliveras López de Victoria\n\nto show, \"by clear and convincing evidence, that the imposition of\n\nsubstantially similar discipline is unwarranted.\"     In re Barach,\n\n540 F.3d 82, 85 (1st Cir. 2008) (per curiam).\n\n          None of the conditions which would warrant our imposing\n\nno discipline or different discipline have been met here.       See\n\nDiscip. R. II.C.   There was no denial of due process; respondent\n\nhad full notice and opportunity to be heard.      There was no due\n\nprocess violation in the Supreme Court's rejection of his last\n\nminute about-face, claiming for the first time that he did not sign\n\nthe motion.   Indeed, as the Supreme Court noted, that effort\n\nundermined his own claim.   There was no question of proof as to the\n\nmisconduct -- respondent admitted misconduct before the lower court\n\nand only later made a last ditch effort to shirk responsibility by\n\nclaiming his signature was forged.     There is no grave injustice\n\n\n                                -6-\n\finvolved in honoring Puerto Rico's own choice of discipline, and we\n\nhave no reason to impose a lesser discipline.\n\n          We also review the district court's decision to impose\n\ndiscipline for abuse of discretion.   See In re Zeno, 504 F.3d 64,\n\n66 (1st Cir. 2007) (per curiam).   The district court did not abuse\n\nits discretion by imposing reciprocal discipline on Oliveras López\n\nde Victoria.\n\n          We affirm the district court's imposition of discipline.\n\nWe impose a suspension from the bar of this court until the Supreme\n\nCourt of Puerto Rico reinstates Oliveras López de Victoria to the\n\npractice of law or otherwise modifies the indefinite suspension.\n\nOliveras López de Victoria may apply for reinstatement in the\n\nfederal court system if the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico alters his\n\nstatus.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",
