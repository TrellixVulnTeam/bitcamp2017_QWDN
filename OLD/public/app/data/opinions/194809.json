Defendants  Rodney Andreoni\n                                  \n\nand  Joseph Argencourt  were  charged in  a two-count  indictment\n\nalleging  their  involvement in  a  cocaine  distribution scheme.\n\nBoth men were convicted on Count 1, which charged a conspiracy to\n\ndistribute more than  500 grams  of cocaine.   Only Andreoni  was\n\nconvicted  on Count 2, which charged an attempt to distribute the\n\nsame  quantity of  the  drug.   Each  appeals his  conviction  on\n\nvarious grounds.  We affirm.\n\n                               I. \n\n     We shall begin with a brief description of the facts, as the\n\njury  could have found them, adding more detail in later sections\n\nas necessary to explain our conclusions.\n\n     The events underlying  this case began  in early 1991,  when\n\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initiated an undercover\n\noperation  to   probe  insurance   fraud  in  Rhode   Island  and\n\nMassachusetts.    Andreoni  was   one  of  the  targets   of  the\n\ninvestigation.   An undercover FBI agent, Gary Brotan, and an FBI\n\ninformant, Mark Vermyea, met  some 60 times with Andreoni  over a\n\nperiod  of   approximately  one  year.    During   one  of  their\n\ndiscussions, Brotan raised  the topic of cocaine.   Andreoni said\n\nthat he could provide substantial quantities of the drug.\n\n     In  the course  of  several  recorded conversations  between\n\nMarch 28, 1991, and August 5, 1991, Andreoni described one of his\n\nsources as an individual from Pawtucket, Rhode Island, named \"Joe\n\nBlack,\"  which is an  alias used  by Argencourt.   On  August 26,\n\nAndreoni,  Argencourt, Brotan and Vermyea attended a meeting at a\n\n                               -4-\n\nrestaurant in  Seekonk, Massachusetts.   The  conversation, which\n\nwas recorded,  began with introductions, followed  immediately by\n\nAndreoni's  statement to  Argencourt, \"Tell  him what  the .  . .\n\nprices  are  right now.\"    Argencourt  responded without  pause,\n\n\"Twenty eight.\"   Supp. App. at  33.  It is  undisputed that this\n\nprice referred to a kilogram of cocaine.\n\n     The discussion  at the meeting also  touched on Argencourt's\n\ncautious approach to  drug dealing.  Argencourt reported  that he\n\npreviously had left  drug trafficking \"because of  all the heat.\"\n\nSupp.  App. at  36.   He  said that  he  had been  set  up by  an\n\ninformant who was  wearing a wire, and  he had not insisted  that\n\nBrotan and  Vermyea be checked  for wires  only because  Andreoni\n\nsaid they  could be trusted.   Id. at 36-38.   Argencourt said he\n                                  \n\nwould kill  anyone who \"cops out\"  on him, and noted  that he had\n\nshot the informant who had worn the wire.  Id. at 38.\n                                              \n\n     The four men discussed the proposed cocaine transaction, and\n\neventually the deal was  set for the upcoming Friday,  August 30.\n\nId.  at 53-55.  Although no location was specified then, Andreoni\n   \n\nand Argencourt arranged in  a phone conversation Thursday evening\n\nto meet at 9:30 a.m.  on Taunton Avenue in East Providence.   Id.\n                                                                 \n\nat 65.   Brotan, Vermyea and Andreoni  met Friday morning  at the\n\ndesignated time and place, but Argencourt never appeared.  An FBI\n\nagent  conducting surveillance reported  seeing Argencourt's car,\n\nhowever, near the appointed  location, at about 10 a.m.  Tr. Vol.\n\nI at  104-06.  The agent,  who identified the car  by its license\n\nplate number, did  not get a look  at the driver.   A few minutes\n\n                               -5-\n\nlater, the agent saw the car parked a short distance away, but he\n\nwas unable to see if anyone was inside.\n\n     After the other three  had waited for a while,  Andreoni, at\n\nthe urging of Brotan  and Vermyea, telephoned Argencourt's office\n\nto find out why he  was late.  Andreoni first reported  back that\n\nhe  had  spoken  to Argencourt's  secretary,  who  told  him that\n\nArgencourt  had not returned from a 9:30 appointment.  Supp. App.\n\nat 71.   After continuing to  wait a substantial period  of time,\n\nthe three men called off the deal and left.\n\n     Andreoni, Brotan and  Vermyea met again  on September 9,  at\n\nwhich  time  Andreoni suggested  an  alternative  way of  getting\n\ncocaine.   Id. at  82-83.  Another  meeting was  held October  8.\n              \n\nAndreoni  told  the government  agents  that no  one  was selling\n\ncocaine because  they  were nervous.    Id. at  84-86.   He  also\n                                           \n\nreported that Argencourt would not return his phone calls.\n\n     The two defendants were  arrested in early 1992  and charged\n\nwith  conspiring to distribute  the one kilogram  of cocaine that\n\nhad  been the  focus  of  the August  26  meeting and  August  30\n\nrendezvous.  No cocaine ever was seized.\n\n                               II. \n\n     Both defendants claim that  the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport  their  conspiracy  convictions.   They  claim  that  the\n\nconversation during the August 26 meeting, although  focused on a\n\npossible cocaine deal, was  vague and noncommittal and failed  to\n\ndemonstrate  the  intent  necessary   to  form  an  agreement  to\n\ndistribute the charged amount  of cocaine.  See United  States v.\n                                                              \n\n                               -6-\n\nO'Campo, 973 F.2d 1015, 1019 (1st Cir. 1992) (describing elements\n       \n\nof conspiracy).\n\n     The  well-established  standard  for evaluating  sufficiency\n\nclaims requires us to  review the evidence as a  whole, including\n\nall reasonable inferences from that  evidence, in the light  most\n\nfavorable to the government.  See, e.g., United States v. Tejeda,\n                                                                \n\n974 F.2d 210, 212 (1st Cir. 1992).  If, in so doing, we find that\n\na rational trier  of fact  could find guilt  beyond a  reasonable\n\ndoubt, we have  no option but to affirm the  jury's verdict.  Id.\n                                                                 \n\nWe may not weigh the evidence, and all credibility questions must\n\nbe resolved in favor of the verdict.  United States v. Ortiz, 966\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 707, 711 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n     While we recognize  that this  case is unusual  in that  the\n\ngovernment  recovered no  cocaine from  these defendants  nor any\n\nother  physical evidence  of drug  dealing, we believe  the tape-\n\nrecorded  conversations and other circumstances were sufficiently\n\ntelling  to support the jury's determination.  Beginning in March\n\n1991,  Andreoni repeatedly  assured  Brotan and  Vermyea that  he\n\ncould arrange  to purchase  cocaine  for them,  and he  mentioned\n\nArgencourt as one of two possible suppliers.  Argencourt appeared\n\nat the August 26 meeting with Andreoni, and,  without hesitation,\n\nstated the price for a kilogram of cocaine.  A  jury easily could\n\nfind  that  the  defendants  came  to  the meeting  intending  to\n\nconsummate a deal with the two government agents.\n\n     The fact that the final details -- the  time and location of\n\nthe  transaction -- were not set until after the meeting does not\n\n                               -7-\n\nundermine  the jury's  conclusion that  a conspiracy  was formed.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Iennaco, 893 F.2d 394, 398 (D.C. Cir.\n                                   \n\n1990)  (\"There  need not  be a  specific  agreement as  to price,\n\nquantity,  and time, place and manner of delivery.\")  Indeed, the\n\nevidence permitted the jury to find that  Andreoni and Argencourt\n\nconsulted and agreed upon those details during a conversation the\n\nevening before the scheduled August  30 deal.  See Supp.  App. at\n                                                  \n\n65,  72.   The jury  also reasonably  could have  found that  the\n\nadmittedly  cautious  Argencourt  arrived  at the  scene  of  the\n\nplanned transaction  at the  designated time but  decided against\n\nmaking the delivery because he detected something amiss.\n\n       This  case  is  unlike  Iennaco, heavily  relied  upon  by\n                                      \n\nArgencourt,  where  the court  reversed  a conspiracy  conviction\n\nbecause  it  found  only  \"various  unaccepted  offers  and  much\n\ntentative  talk,\" 893 F.2d at 398.  The defendants here discussed\n\nwith the  interested purchasers a specific  one-kilogram, $28,000\n\ncocaine  deal that  was  to  take  place  on  a  particular  day.\n\nSubsequent actions and statements by the two defendants confirmed\n\n-- or so the jury could have found -- that deal.  We consequently\n\nfind no basis for disturbing the jury's verdict on the conspiracy\n\ncount.1\n\n                              III. \n\n                    \n\n1 For the same reasons, we  affirm the district court's denial of\nArgencourt's  motion  for  new  trial.    See  United  States  v.\n                                                             \nRothrock, 806  F.2d 318, 321-22  (1st Cir. 1986)  (disposition of\n        \nnew  trial motion  will not  be disturbed  on appeal  \"unless the\ncourt abused its discretion or misapplied the law\").\n\n                               -8-\n\n     Andreoni  also challenges  the sufficiency  of the  evidence\n\nsupporting his  conviction on Count  2 for attempt  to distribute\n\ncocaine.  To prove attempt, the government must establish both an\n\nintent to commit the substantive offense and a \"`substantial step\n\ntowards its  commission,'\" United States v.  Chapdelaine, No. 92-\n                                                        \n\n1358, slip  op. at 10  (1st Cir. March 25,  1993) (quoting United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Figueroa, 976 F.2d  1446, 1459 (1st Cir. 1992)).   This\n                  \n\nstep must be \"`more  than mere preparation'\" but \"`less  than the\n\nlast  act   necessary  before   the  actual  commission   of  the\n\nsubstantive crime,'\" Chapdelaine, slip  op. at 10 (quoting United\n                                                                 \n\nStates v. Manley, 632 F.2d 978, 987 (2d Cir. 1980)).\n                \n\n     The evidence  described in the  preceding section adequately\n\nestablishes  Andreoni's intent  to commit the  substantive crime.\n\nWe think it beyond debate that he also engaged in the substantial\n\nstep necessary  to corroborate his  intent.  After  arranging the\n\nmeeting  at the restaurant on August 26, Andreoni nailed down the\n\ndetails  of the transaction in a conversation with Argencourt and\n\ncommunicated  the information  to Brotan  and Vermyea.   Andreoni\n\nhooked up with the  two government agents at the  appointed time,\n\nand waited  for a substantial  period with them  for Argencourt's\n\narrival.  He  called Argencourt's office in an effort to find out\n\nabout  the  delay.   The jury  reasonably  could have  found that\n\nAndreoni  had taken the  transaction to the  brink of completion,\n\nand  that it failed to  occur only because  of Argencourt's last-\n\nminute  caution.    This certainly  was  enough  to establish  an\n\nattempt.\n\n                               -9-\n\n                               IV. \n\n     Argencourt  challenges the  district court's  denial of  his\n\nmid-trial  motion   for  severance,   which  was  based   on  the\n\nintroduction of  evidence of other crimes  committed by Andreoni.\n\nThe evidence at issue concerned Andreoni's solicitation of arson.\n\nAndreoni's lawyer initially  elicited testimony about  arson from\n\nAgent  Brotan in  an effort  to develop  the defense  theory that\n\nAndreoni  had pretended to comply with Brotan and Vermyea's plans\n\nbecause he feared  they would harm  or kill his family.   Through\n\nhis  cross-examination,  the lawyer  established that  Brotan and\n\nVermyea had portrayed themselves as dangerous individuals willing\n\nto commit violent acts,  and that Vermyea had told  Andreoni that\n\nburning buildings was his specialty.  Tr. Vol. I at 79, 89-90.\n\n      On redirect,  the prosecutor  asked Brotan about  the arson\n\ndiscussions he  had had  with Andreoni.    Brotan testified  that\n\nAndreoni  had suggested that Brotan and Vermyea might be hired to\n\nburn both a Providence restaurant belonging to Andreoni's brother\n\nand the house of an attorney whose wife had been awarded the home\n\nin  a  divorce settlement.    According to  Brotan,  Andreoni had\n\nindicated that it did not matter if the wife was in the  house at\n\nthe time it was burned.\n\n     Argencourt's severance motion was  premised entirely on this\n\narson testimony.  See Tr.  Vol. I at 162.2  The  court's decision\n                     \n\nto deny the motion  is reversible only upon  a strong showing  of\n\n                    \n\n2 The trial also included testimony about other  criminal conduct\nby Andreoni, see Section  V infra, but the severance  motion made\n                                 \nreference only to the arson activity.\n\n                               -10-\n\nprejudice,  demonstrating a  manifest  abuse  of discretion  that\n\ndenied  the defendant a fair trial.   See United States v. Olivo-\n                                                                 \n\nInfante,  938 F.2d 1406, 1409  (1st Cir. 1991);  United States v.\n                                                              \n\nBoylan, 898 F.2d 230, 246 (1st Cir. 1990).\n      \n\n     Argencourt has not met this standard.  As an initial matter,\n\nhis attorney failed to  object to Brotan's testimony when  it was\n\ngiven.  This fact was noted by the district court, see Tr. Vol. I\n                                                      \n\nat 162,  and, in our view,  suggests that the evidence  had less-\n\nthan-monumental   significance  to   Argencourt's  case.     More\n\nimportantly, the  lawyer did cross-examine Brotan  at some length\n\nfor the purpose of establishing  that Argencourt was not involved\n\nin Andreoni's other criminal activities, including arson, and the\n\nagent's  testimony unequivocally  excluded Argencourt  from those\n\ncrimes.   See Tr. Vol. I at  101-02.  The record thus provides no\n             \n\nbasis for a  finding of  prejudice.  Consquently,  we affirm  the\n\ndistrict court's denial of Argencourt's severance motion.\n\n                                V.\n\n     Andreoni claims  that the  district court erred  by allowing\n\ninto evidence testimony concerning his efforts to obtain firearms\n\nfor Brotan and Vermyea.  We think it apparent that  the testimony\n\nhad  a reasonable connection with  issues in the  case and, given\n\nits  relevance, the district court's weighing of the value of the\n\nevidence  against its  prejudicial effect  fell within  the trial\n\njudge's  discretion.  See United States v. Spinosa, 982 F.2d 620,\n                                                  \n\n628  (1st Cir.  1992) (admission  of prior  bad acts  evidence is\n\nreviewed only for abuse of discretion).\n\n                               -11-\n\n     It  is well  established that, under  Fed. R.  Evid. 404(b),\n\nevidence  of prior  bad  acts  is  not  admissible  to  show  bad\n\ncharacter  or propensity to commit  a crime, but  may be admitted\n\nwhen  it  has  some  \"special,\"  non-character based  relevance.3\n\nUnited States  v.  Arias-Montoya, 967  F.2d  708, 709  (1st  Cir.\n                                \n\n1992).  In this case, a primary defense theory was that Andreoni,\n\nthroughout  his relationship  with  the  government  agents,  was\n\nmerely puffing, making wild and unfounded promises that he had no\n\nability or intention  to fulfill.   Andreoni wanted  the jury  to\n\nbelieve that the  proposed cocaine deal was no more than big talk\n\nby an expert bragger.\n\n     Evidence that Andreoni did  follow through on obtaining guns\n\nfor  Brotan and Vermyea strikes at the  heart of this theory and,\n\nconsequently, had significant probative value for a purpose other\n\nthan showing criminal propensity.  See Figueroa, 976 F.2d at 1454\n                                               \n\n(other   acts  evidence   admissible   to   corroborate   matters\n\nsignificant to the prosecution's  case).  Our caselaw establishes\n\nthat   such  evidence   is   admissible  unless   its  value   is\n\n\"substantially  outweighed\"  by  the  risk  of  unfair prejudice,\n\nconfusion,  or waste of time.  See, e.g., Arias-Montoya, 967 F.2d\n                                                       \n\nat  710; Fed.  R. Evid.  403.   No such imbalance  occurred here.\n\nAlthough the evidence certainly was prejudicial, nothing about it\n\n                    \n\n3 Fed. R. Evid.  404(b) states that \"[e]vidence of  other crimes,\nwrongs, or  acts is not  admissible to  prove the character  of a\nperson in order to show action in conformity  therewith.  It may,\nhowever,  be admissible  for  other purposes,  such  as proof  of\nmotive,  opportunity,  intent,   preparation,  plan,   knowledge,\nidentity, or absence of mistake or accident . . . .\"\n\n                               -12-\n\nwas  unfairly so.  See Spinosa, 982  F.2d at 628.  The jury knew,\n                              \n\nfrom  other testimony,  that  Andreoni was  involved in  criminal\n\nactivities  other than  the alleged  cocaine dealing.   Moreover,\n\nwhen the firearms  evidence first was  elicited from Brotan,  the\n\ndistrict court gave a limiting instruction advising the jury that\n\nit  was  admissible  \"only for  the  purpose  of  disclosing what\n\nrelationships were  between the parties . . . .\"   See Tr. Vol. I\n                                                      \n\nat 99.4  We therefore reject this claim of error.5\n\n                               VI.\n\n     During deliberations,  the jurors  asked to rehear  the tape\n\nrecording  of the conversation that took place on August 26 among\n\nthe defendants and the two government agents.   Argencourt argues\n\non appealthat thedistrict courterred inacceding to theirrequest.6\n\n                    \n\n4  The firearms  testimony was elicited  twice during  the trial,\nfirst from  Brotan during redirect examination  by the prosecutor\nand  later from Andreoni when  he testified as  a defense witness\nfor  Argencourt.    When  Brotan  testified,  Andreoni's  counsel\nobjected to the evidence  as irrelevant, and it was at  that time\nthat  the  district court  instructed  the  jury  of the  limited\nappropriate use for the  evidence.  See Tr. Vol.  I at 99.   When\n                                       \nthe  testimony was  elicited a  second time,  from Andreoni,  the\nattorney raised a specific 404(b) objection.   In overruling that\nobjection, the  trial judge noted Andreoni's defense  that he was\n\"play acting.\"   See Supp. App. at 114-15.   There was no request\n                    \nfor a limiting instruction at that time, and none was given.\n\n5 In light of our disposition, we do not address the government's\nsuggestion that Andreoni's 404(b) objection was untimely.  Nor do\nwe  consider Andreoni's  cursory  reference  to the  government's\nfailure to give pretrial notice of its intent to use the firearms\nevidence.    This  issue  was neither  raised  below  nor briefed\nmeaningfully on appeal.\n\n6 The tape recording  for August 26 was introduced  into evidence\nin  two parts.   One cassette contained  a recording  of the two-\nminute interval  between the time  the recorder was  activated in\nthe  parking lot  of  the restaurant  and  the beginning  of  the\nconversation inside the restaurant.  The other tape contained the\n\n                               -13-\n\n     We  repeatedly  have held  that  the decision  to  reread or\n\nreplay  testimony during  jury deliberations  rests in  the sound\n\ndiscretion  of the district court.  See United States v. Akitoye,\n                                                                \n\n923 F.2d 221, 226 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing cases).  The factors to\n\nbe considered are \"the reasonableness of the request, the ease or\n\ndifficulty  in compliance,  and what  is likely  to be  gained or\n\nlost.\"  Id.\n           \n\n     With  these  factors in  mind, there  is  no doubt  that the\n\ndistrict  court acted  well within  its discretion.   The  jury's\n\nrequest was  specific and easy to accommodate.   The conversation\n\nthe  jury sought  to revisit  was the  most significant  piece of\n\nevidence  presented  by  the  prosecution,  particularly  against\n\nArgencourt, and providing the jury with a second chance to digest\n\nit strikes us as  fully appropriate.  Indeed, the  jurors' desire\n\nfor a repetition is likely to reflect an appropriate concern that\n\nthe conversation be evaluated  as carefully as possible.   We see\n\nno likelihood that the jury gave it undue emphasis.   \n\n                               VII.\n\n     Both  defendants  argue that  the  district  court erred  in\n\ncalculating  their  offense  levels  based  on  one  kilogram  of\n\ncocaine.  Although  they do not dispute that one kilogram was the\n\n                    \n\nconversation.  Both  tapes had been played for  the jury, and the\ncourt ordered that  both be  replayed in response  to the  jury's\nrequest during deliberations.\n     Although his brief is unclear, we believe Argencourt intends\non  appeal to challenge the replaying of both tapes.  Regardless,\nwe see  no need to dwell  on this ambiguity or to  delve into the\nissue  of waiver, raised by  the government, because  we think it\nmanifest that the court acted properly.  See infra.\n                                                  \n\n                               -14-\n\namount  negotiated,7  they  claim  that  there  was  insufficient\n\nevidence  that they  were capable  of actually  producing such  a\n\nlarge quantity  of the drug.   Under  the Sentencing  Guidelines,\n\nthey  assert,  the amount  of  drugs involved  in  an uncompleted\n\ntransaction may  be  considered only  if the  evidence shows  the\n\ndefendants intended  to produce,  and were reasonably  capable of\n\nproducing, that amount.  See U.S.S.G.   2D1.1, comment. (n.12).8\n                            \n\n     This argument  has some  facial appeal because,  as Andreoni\n\nargues, \"during the entire transaction,  no drugs were seized, no\n\nsamples  were  given,  no  money  exchanged  for  drugs  and   no\n\ndistribution of drugs was made.\"   Brief at 27.  Andreoni  had no\n\nhistory  of drug dealing and Argencourt  stated during the August\n\n26 meeting that he had been out of the business for some time.\n\n     The claim  fails upon  closer scrutiny, however,  because it\n\nis,  in essence, simply a  reiteration of the  sufficiency of the\n\nevidence argument.  Although  the defendants claim that  the one-\n\nkilogram  amount used by the district  court is too high, they do\n\n                    \n\n7  Andreoni explicitly  acknowledges that  one kilogram  was \"the\nnegotiated amount of drugs,\"  see Brief at 26.   Argencourt makes\n                                 \nno argument that the government or court misunderstood the amount\nbeing discussed in the tape-recorded conversations. \n\n8 The note states, in pertinent part:\n\n     [W]here  the court  finds  that the  defendant did  not\n     intend  to produce  and was  not reasonably  capable of\n     producing   the  negotiated  amount,  the  court  shall\n     exclude from the guideline calculation  the amount that\n     it finds  the defendant did  not intend to  produce and\n     was not reasonably capable of producing.\n\nUntil  November  1992, when  the  Guidelines  were amended,  this\nstatement appeared in   2D1.4, comment. (n.1).\n\n                               -15-\n\nnot say what amount  the district court properly could  have used\n\nfor  calculating  their  offense  levels.   In  our  view,  their\n\nobjection  is really to  the jury's finding of  guilt, and to the\n\ncourt's endorsement of it through sentencing.\n\n     This is not to say  that a finding of guilt in  a conspiracy\n\ncase,  by   itself,  binds  a  court  to  the  amount  explicitly\n\nnegotiated  by  the  defendants.   A  jury's  supportable  guilty\n\nverdict may establish that the defendants intended to produce the\n\nquantity at issue,  which in turn is at least  some evidence of a\n\ncapacity  to  produce  it.    It  is  not,  however,  conclusive.\n\nApplication  note 12  permits the  court to  hold the  defendants\n\nresponsible for a lesser quantity, notwithstanding their specific\n\nnegotiations,  if the  court is  unpersuaded that  the defendants\n\nactually intended and could have provided the full amount.\n\n     The application note does  not help defendants in this  case\n\nbecause  the  evidence  suggests the  capacity,  as  well as  the\n\nintent,  to sell one kilogram of cocaine.  The taped negotiations\n\ndemonstrated the  defendants' knowledge about the  drug trade and\n\nrevealed   that   Argencourt  had   significant   past  narcotics\n\nexperience.   See  Supp. App.  at 33-36.   Andreoni's  efforts to\n                 \n\nobtain  firearms  for  the agents  suggested  real criminal-world\n\nconnections.  In accepting the one-kilogram amount as a realistic\n\nreflection  of the  defendants' culpability,  the district  court\n\nrelied specifically on the  fact that Argencourt, at the  time of\n\n                               -16-\n\nthis  offense, was out on bail on  state drug charges.9  That the\n\nstate charges  involved significantly smaller amounts  of cocaine\n\nthan  the one  kilogram does  not undermine  the crucial  fact of\n\nprior access  to the  drug.   These circumstances taken  together\n\namply  support  the  district  court's  finding  that  defendants\n\nintended  to   provide,  and  were  capable   of  providing,  the\n\nnegotiated amount of cocaine.  See United States v. McCarthy, 961\n                                                            \n\nF.2d 972,  978 (1st Cir. 1992)  (sentencing court's determination\n\nof drug amount reviewed only for clear error).10\n\n     Thus, this claim, like the others, is unavailing.\n\n     Affirmed.\n             \n\n                    \n\n9  According to  Argencourt's  presentence report,  the incidents\nunderlying  the state  charges  occurred in  November 1990  when,\nunder  surveillance by Pawtucket police, a confidential informant\nmade  three purchases of cocaine  from him.   Two counts alleging\ndelivery  of  cocaine  ultimately  were  dismissed,  and  he  was\nsentenced  on  a  single  count of  possession  of  a  controlled\nsubstance.\n\n10  The  circuits have  not been  uniform  in their  treatment of\napplication  note  12.    A  conflict  exists  over  whether  the\ngovernment bears the  burden of showing  intent and capacity,  or\nwhether  the  defendant bears  the burden  of  showing a  lack of\nintent  and capacity, see United States v. Barnes, 1993 U.S. App.\n                                                 \nLEXIS 11153, at *5-9 (9th Cir. May  17, 1993) (citing cases), and\nsome  confusion exists  over  whether the  court  is required  to\nexclude a negotiated amount only where the  defendant lacked both\n                                                                 \nthe  intent and the ability to complete the drug transaction, see\n                                                                 \nUnited States v.

Even assuming the government had the burden, the evidence\nwas  sufficient  to support  the  district  court's finding  that\ndefendants intended  and could  produce the negotiated  amount of\n                        \ncocaine.\n\n                               -17-\n",

We affirm.\n\n                               I. \n\n     We shall begin with a brief description of the facts, as the\n\njury  could have found them, adding more detail in later sections\n\nas necessary to explain our conclusions.\n\n     The events underlying  this case began  in early 1991,  when\n\nthe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) initiated an undercover\n\noperation  to   probe  insurance   fraud  in  Rhode   Island  and\n\nMassachusetts.    Andreoni  was   one  of  the  targets   of  the\n\ninvestigation.   An undercover FBI agent, Gary Brotan, and an FBI\n\ninformant, Mark Vermyea, met  some 60 times with Andreoni  over a\n\nperiod  of   approximately  one  year.    During   one  of  their\n\ndiscussions, Brotan raised  the topic of cocaine.   Andreoni said\n\nthat he could provide substantial quantities of the drug.\n\n     In  the course  of  several  recorded conversations  between\n\nMarch 28, 1991, and August 5, 1991, Andreoni described one of his\n\nsources as an individual from Pawtucket, Rhode Island, named \"Joe\n\nBlack,\"  which is an  alias used  by Argencourt.   On  August 26,\n\nAndreoni,  Argencourt, Brotan and Vermyea attended a meeting at a\n\n                               -4-\n\nrestaurant in  Seekonk, Massachusetts.   The  conversation, which\n\nwas recorded,  began with introductions, followed  immediately by\n\nAndreoni's  statement to  Argencourt, \"Tell  him what  the .  . .\n\nprices  are  right now.\"    Argencourt  responded without  pause,\n\n\"Twenty eight.\"   Supp. App. at  33.  It is  undisputed that this\n\nprice referred to a kilogram of cocaine.\n\n     The discussion  at the meeting also  touched on Argencourt's\n\ncautious approach to  drug dealing.  Argencourt reported  that he\n\npreviously had left  drug trafficking \"because of  all the heat.\"\n\nSupp.  App. at  36.   He  said that  he  had been  set  up by  an\n\ninformant who was  wearing a wire, and  he had not insisted  that\n\nBrotan and  Vermyea be checked  for wires  only because  Andreoni\n\nsaid they  could be trusted.   Id. at 36-38.   Argencourt said he\n                                  \n\nwould kill  anyone who \"cops out\"  on him, and noted  that he had\n\nshot the informant who had worn the wire.  Id. at 38.\n                                              \n\n     The four men discussed the proposed cocaine transaction, and\n\neventually the deal was  set for the upcoming Friday,  August 30.\n\nId.  at 53-55.  Although no location was specified then, Andreoni\n   \n\nand Argencourt arranged in  a phone conversation Thursday evening\n\nto meet at 9:30 a.m.  on Taunton Avenue in East Providence.   Id.\n                                                                 \n\nat 65.   Brotan, Vermyea and Andreoni  met Friday morning  at the\n\ndesignated time and place, but Argencourt never appeared.  An FBI\n\nagent  conducting surveillance reported  seeing Argencourt's car,\n\nhowever, near the appointed  location, at about 10 a.m.  Tr. Vol.\n\nI at  104-06.  The agent,  who identified the car  by its license\n\nplate number, did  not get a look  at the driver.   A few minutes\n\n                               -5-\n\nlater, the agent saw the car parked a short distance away, but he\n\nwas unable to see if anyone was inside.\n\n     After the other three  had waited for a while,  Andreoni, at\n\nthe urging of Brotan  and Vermyea, telephoned Argencourt's office\n\nto find out why he  was late.  Andreoni first reported  back that\n\nhe  had  spoken  to Argencourt's  secretary,  who  told  him that\n\nArgencourt  had not returned from a 9:30 appointment.  Supp. App.\n\nat 71.   After continuing to  wait a substantial period  of time,\n\nthe three men called off the deal and left.\n\n     Andreoni, Brotan and  Vermyea met again  on September 9,  at\n\nwhich  time  Andreoni suggested  an  alternative  way of  getting\n\ncocaine.   Id. at  82-83.  Another  meeting was  held October  8.\n              \n\nAndreoni  told  the government  agents  that no  one  was selling\n\ncocaine because  they  were nervous.    Id. at  84-86.   He  also\n                                           \n\nreported that Argencourt would not return his phone calls.\n\n     The two defendants were  arrested in early 1992  and charged\n\nwith  conspiring to distribute  the one kilogram  of cocaine that\n\nhad  been the  focus  of  the August  26  meeting and  August  30\n\nrendezvous.  No cocaine ever was seized.\n\n                               II. \n\n     Both defendants claim that  the evidence was insufficient to\n\nsupport  their  conspiracy  convictions.   They  claim  that  the\n\nconversation during the August 26 meeting, although  focused on a\n\npossible cocaine deal, was  vague and noncommittal and failed  to\n\ndemonstrate  the  intent  necessary   to  form  an  agreement  to\n\ndistribute the charged amount  of cocaine.

Beginning in March\n\n1991,  Andreoni repeatedly  assured  Brotan and  Vermyea that  he\n\ncould arrange  to purchase  cocaine  for them,  and he  mentioned\n\nArgencourt as one of two possible suppliers.  Argencourt appeared\n\nat the August 26 meeting with Andreoni, and,  without hesitation,\n\nstated the price for a kilogram of cocaine.  A  jury easily could\n\nfind  that  the  defendants  came  to  the meeting  intending  to\n\nconsummate a deal with the two government agents.\n\n     The fact that the final details -- the  time and location of\n\nthe  transaction -- were not set until after the meeting does not\n\n                               -7-\n\nundermine  the jury's  conclusion that  a conspiracy  was formed.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v.

See Supp.  App. at\n                                                  \n\n65,  72.   The jury  also reasonably  could have  found that  the\n\nadmittedly  cautious  Argencourt  arrived  at the  scene  of  the\n\nplanned transaction  at the  designated time but  decided against\n\nmaking the delivery because he detected something amiss.\n\n       This  case  is  unlike  Iennaco, heavily  relied  upon  by\n                                      \n\nArgencourt,  where  the court  reversed  a conspiracy  conviction\n\nbecause  it  found  only  \"various  unaccepted  offers  and  much\n\ntentative  talk,\" 893 F.2d at 398.  The defendants here discussed\n\nwith the  interested purchasers a specific  one-kilogram, $28,000\n\ncocaine  deal that  was  to  take  place  on  a  particular  day.\n\nSubsequent actions and statements by the two defendants confirmed\n\n-- or so the jury could have found -- that deal.

After  arranging the\n\nmeeting  at the restaurant on August 26, Andreoni nailed down the\n\ndetails  of the transaction in a conversation with Argencourt and\n\ncommunicated  the information  to Brotan  and Vermyea.   Andreoni\n\nhooked up with the  two government agents at the  appointed time,\n\nand waited  for a substantial  period with them  for Argencourt's\n\narrival.  He  called Argencourt's office in an effort to find out\n\nabout  the  delay.   The jury  reasonably  could have  found that\n\nAndreoni  had taken the  transaction to the  brink of completion,\n\nand  that it failed to  occur only because  of Argencourt's last-\n\nminute  caution.    This certainly  was  enough  to establish  an\n\nattempt.\n\n                               -9-\n\n                               IV. \n\n     Argencourt  challenges the  district court's  denial of  his\n\nmid-trial  motion   for  severance,   which  was  based   on  the\n\nintroduction of  evidence of other crimes  committed by Andreoni.\n\nThe evidence at issue concerned Andreoni's solicitation of arson.\n\nAndreoni's lawyer initially  elicited testimony about  arson from\n\nAgent  Brotan in  an effort  to develop  the defense  theory that\n\nAndreoni  had pretended to comply with Brotan and Vermyea's plans\n\nbecause he feared  they would harm  or kill his family.   Through\n\nhis  cross-examination,  the lawyer  established that  Brotan and\n\nVermyea had portrayed themselves as dangerous individuals willing\n\nto commit violent acts,  and that Vermyea had told  Andreoni that\n\nburning buildings was his specialty.  Tr. Vol. I at 79, 89-90.\n\n      On redirect,  the prosecutor  asked Brotan about  the arson\n\ndiscussions he  had had  with Andreoni.    Brotan testified  that\n\nAndreoni  had suggested that Brotan and Vermyea might be hired to\n\nburn both a Providence restaurant belonging to Andreoni's brother\n\nand the house of an attorney whose wife had been awarded the home\n\nin  a  divorce settlement.    According to  Brotan,  Andreoni had\n\nindicated that it did not matter if the wife was in the  house at\n\nthe time it was burned.\n\n     Argencourt's severance motion was  premised entirely on this\n\narson testimony.  See Tr.

As an initial matter,\n\nhis attorney failed to  object to Brotan's testimony when  it was\n\ngiven.  This fact was noted by the district court, see Tr. Vol. I\n                                                      \n\nat 162,  and, in our view,  suggests that the evidence  had less-\n\nthan-monumental   significance  to   Argencourt's  case.     More\n\nimportantly, the  lawyer did cross-examine Brotan  at some length\n\nfor the purpose of establishing  that Argencourt was not involved\n\nin Andreoni's other criminal activities, including arson, and the\n\nagent's  testimony unequivocally  excluded Argencourt  from those\n\ncrimes.   See Tr. Vol. I at  101-02.  The record thus provides no\n             \n\nbasis for a  finding of  prejudice.  Consquently,  we affirm  the\n\ndistrict court's denial of Argencourt's severance motion.\n\n                                V.\n\n     Andreoni claims  that the  district court erred  by allowing\n\ninto evidence testimony concerning his efforts to obtain firearms\n\nfor Brotan and Vermyea.  We think it apparent that  the testimony\n\nhad  a reasonable connection with  issues in the  case and, given\n\nits  relevance, the district court's weighing of the value of the\n\nevidence  against its  prejudicial effect  fell within  the trial\n\njudge's  discretion.

Moreover,\n\nwhen the firearms  evidence first was  elicited from Brotan,  the\n\ndistrict court gave a limiting instruction advising the jury that\n\nit  was  admissible  \"only for  the  purpose  of  disclosing what\n\nrelationships were  between the parties . . . .\"   See Tr. Vol. I\n                                                      \n\nat 99.4  We therefore reject this claim of error.5\n\n                               VI.\n\n     During deliberations,  the jurors  asked to rehear  the tape\n\nrecording  of the conversation that took place on August 26 among\n\nthe defendants and the two government agents.   Argencourt argues\n\non appealthat thedistrict courterred inacceding to theirrequest.6\n\n                    \n\n4  The firearms  testimony was elicited  twice during  the trial,\nfirst from  Brotan during redirect examination  by the prosecutor\nand  later from Andreoni when  he testified as  a defense witness\nfor  Argencourt.    When  Brotan  testified,  Andreoni's  counsel\nobjected to the evidence  as irrelevant, and it was at  that time\nthat  the  district court  instructed  the  jury  of the  limited\nappropriate use for the  evidence.  See Tr. Vol.  I at 99.   When\n                                       \nthe  testimony was  elicited a  second time,  from Andreoni,  the\nattorney raised a specific 404(b) objection.   In overruling that\nobjection, the  trial judge noted Andreoni's defense  that he was\n\"play acting.\"   See Supp. App. at 114-15.   There was no request\n                    \nfor a limiting instruction at that time, and none was given.\n\n5 In light of our disposition, we do not address the government's\nsuggestion that Andreoni's 404(b) objection was untimely.  Nor do\nwe  consider Andreoni's  cursory  reference  to the  government's\nfailure to give pretrial notice of its intent to use the firearms\nevidence.    This  issue  was neither  raised  below  nor briefed\nmeaningfully on appeal.\n\n6 The tape recording  for August 26 was introduced  into evidence\nin  two parts.   One cassette contained  a recording  of the two-\nminute interval  between the time  the recorder was  activated in\nthe  parking lot  of  the restaurant  and  the beginning  of  the\nconversation inside the restaurant.  The other tape contained the\n\n                               -13-\n\n     We  repeatedly  have held  that  the decision  to  reread or\n\nreplay  testimony during  jury deliberations  rests in  the sound\n\ndiscretion  of the district court.  See United States v. Akitoye,\n                                                                \n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"554021\"><a href=\"/opinion/554021/united-states-v-adegboyega-akitoye/\"><span class=\"volume\">923</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 226 (1st Cir. 1991) (citing cases).  The factors to\n\nbe considered are \"the reasonableness of the request, the ease or\n\ndifficulty  in compliance,  and what  is likely  to be  gained or\n\nlost.\"  Id.\n           \n\n     With  these  factors in  mind, there  is  no doubt  that the\n\ndistrict  court acted  well within  its discretion.   The  jury's\n\nrequest was  specific and easy to accommodate.   The conversation\n\nthe  jury sought  to revisit  was the  most significant  piece of\n\nevidence  presented  by  the  prosecution,  particularly  against\n\nArgencourt, and providing the jury with a second chance to digest\n\nit strikes us as  fully appropriate.  Indeed, the  jurors' desire\n\nfor a repetition is likely to reflect an appropriate concern that\n\nthe conversation be evaluated  as carefully as possible.   We see\n\nno likelihood that the jury gave it undue emphasis.   \n\n                               VII.\n\n     Both  defendants  argue that  the  district  court erred  in\n\ncalculating  their  offense  levels  based  on  one  kilogram  of\n\ncocaine.  Although  they do not dispute that one kilogram was the\n\n                    \n\nconversation.  Both  tapes had been played for  the jury, and the\ncourt ordered that  both be  replayed in response  to the  jury's\nrequest during deliberations.\n     Although his brief is unclear, we believe Argencourt intends\non  appeal to challenge the replaying of both tapes.  Regardless,\nwe see  no need to dwell  on this ambiguity or to  delve into the\nissue  of waiver, raised by  the government, because  we think it\nmanifest that the court acted properly.  See infra.\n                                                  \n\n                               -14-\n\namount  negotiated,7  they  claim  that  there  was  insufficient\n\nevidence  that they  were capable  of actually  producing such  a\n\nlarge quantity  of the drug.   Under  the Sentencing  Guidelines,\n\nthey  assert,  the amount  of  drugs involved  in  an uncompleted\n\ntransaction may  be  considered only  if the  evidence shows  the\n\ndefendants intended  to produce,  and were reasonably  capable of\n\nproducing, that amount.  See U.S.S.G.   2D1.1, comment. (n.12).8\n                            \n\n     This argument  has some  facial appeal because,  as Andreoni\n\nargues, \"during the entire transaction,  no drugs were seized, no\n\nsamples  were  given,  no  money  exchanged  for  drugs  and   no\n\ndistribution of drugs was made.\"   Brief at 27.  Andreoni  had no\n\nhistory  of drug dealing and Argencourt  stated during the August\n\n26 meeting that he had been out of the business for some time.\n\n     The claim  fails upon  closer scrutiny, however,  because it\n\nis,  in essence, simply a  reiteration of the  sufficiency of the\n\nevidence argument.  Although  the defendants claim that  the one-\n\nkilogram  amount used by the district  court is too high, they do\n\n                    \n\n7  Andreoni explicitly  acknowledges that  one kilogram  was \"the\nnegotiated amount of drugs,\"  see Brief at 26.   Argencourt makes\n                                 \nno argument that the government or court misunderstood the amount\nbeing discussed in the tape-recorded conversations. \n\n8 The note states, in pertinent part:\n\n     [W]here  the court  finds  that the  defendant did  not\n     intend  to produce  and was  not reasonably  capable of\n     producing   the  negotiated  amount,  the  court  shall\n     exclude from the guideline calculation  the amount that\n     it finds  the defendant did  not intend to  produce and\n     was not reasonably capable of producing.\n\nUntil  November  1992, when  the  Guidelines  were amended,  this\nstatement appeared in   2D1.4, comment. (n.1).\n\n                               -15-\n\nnot say what amount  the district court properly could  have used\n\nfor  calculating  their  offense  levels.   In  our  view,  their\n\nobjection  is really to  the jury's finding of  guilt, and to the\n\ncourt's endorsement of it through sentencing.\n\n     This is not to say  that a finding of guilt in  a conspiracy\n\ncase,  by   itself,  binds  a  court  to  the  amount  explicitly\n\nnegotiated  by  the  defendants.   A  jury's  supportable  guilty\n\nverdict may establish that the defendants intended to produce the\n\nquantity at issue,  which in turn is at least  some evidence of a\n\ncapacity  to  produce  it.    It  is  not,  however,  conclusive.\n\nApplication  note 12  permits the  court to  hold the  defendants\n\nresponsible for a lesser quantity, notwithstanding their specific\n\nnegotiations,  if the  court is  unpersuaded that  the defendants\n\nactually intended and could have provided the full amount.\n\n     The application note does  not help defendants in this  case\n\nbecause  the  evidence  suggests the  capacity,  as  well as  the\n\nintent,  to sell one kilogram of cocaine.  The taped negotiations\n\ndemonstrated the  defendants' knowledge about the  drug trade and\n\nrevealed   that   Argencourt  had   significant   past  narcotics\n\nexperience.   See  Supp. App.  at 33-36.   Andreoni's  efforts to\n                 \n\nobtain  firearms  for  the agents  suggested  real criminal-world\n\nconnections.  In accepting the one-kilogram amount as a realistic\n\nreflection  of the  defendants' culpability,  the district  court\n\nrelied specifically on the  fact that Argencourt, at the  time of\n\n                               -16-\n\nthis  offense, was out on bail on  state drug charges.9  That the\n\nstate charges  involved significantly smaller amounts  of cocaine\n\nthan  the one  kilogram does  not undermine  the crucial  fact of\n\nprior access  to the  drug.   These circumstances taken  together\n\namply  support  the  district  court's  finding  that  defendants\n\nintended  to   provide,  and  were  capable   of  providing,  the\n\nnegotiated amount of cocaine.
