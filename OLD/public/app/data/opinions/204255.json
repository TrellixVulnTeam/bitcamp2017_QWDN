To abate crime, Puerto Rico\n\nadopted a Controlled Access Law, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23, §§ 64-64h\n\n(2008), allowing local entities (called \"urbanizations\"), organized\n\nby the community but approved by the municipality, to control\n\nstreet access to areas within towns that have voted in favor of\n\nsuch plans.    Appellants are two corporations operated by the\n\nGoverning Body of Jehovah's Witnesses1 that challenged in federal\n\ndistrict court both the statute and its application.    Apart from\n\ndefault or consent judgments against some of the defendants, the\n\ndistrict court denied relief.    The background is as follows.\n\n           Jehovah's Witnesses accept a religious duty to share the\n\nBible's message publicly and to proselytize from house to house.\n\nWatchtower Bible & Tract Soc'y of N.Y., Inc. v. Vill. of Stratton,\n\n536 U.S. 150, 160-61 (2002) (discussing Murdock v. Pennsylvania,\n\n319 U.S. 105, 108 (1943)).   They engage in door-to-door ministry,\n\ncommunicate about the Bible with people on public streets, and\n\noffer religious literature to anyone interested in reading it.\n\nThey say that their activities in Puerto Rico have been constrained\n\nby urbanizations acting pursuant to the Controlled Access Law that\n\nis the subject of this appeal.\n\n\n     1\n      Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.\ncoordinates the preaching activities of Jehovah's Witnesses\nthroughout the United States and publishes widely distributed\nreligious literature. Congregación Cristiana de los Testigos de\nJehová de Puerto Rico, Inc. oversees the 318 congregations of\nJehovah's Witnesses in Puerto Rico, which have about 25,000\nmembers.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f           The Controlled Access Law--adopted in 1987 and amended in\n\n1988, 1992, 1997, and 1998--was prompted by and adopted against a\n\nbackground of endemic violent crime.            Puerto Rico, with a median\n\nhousehold income only about one-third of the U.S. national average\n\nand less than half of every other state, has a homicide rate\n\nquadruple the U.S. national rate and more than double that of\n\nvirtually every state.2      It is a major drug transit point, and drug\n\ndealing has led in a number of cases to corruption among local\n\npolice.3\n\n           The    statute,      as    currently      amended,    authorizes\n\nmunicipalities    to   grant    permits    to    neighborhood   homeowners'\n\nassociations     called   urbanizations     to     control   vehicular   and\n\npedestrian access to the public residential streets within the\n\nurbanization (the term referring either to the association or to\n\nthe controlled area).      In such cases, the area is enclosed with\n\nfencing or other barriers and with one or more entry and exit gates\n\nfor pedestrians and vehicles.        P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23, § 64.       Some\n\nof the gates are manned by security guards paid by the association;\n\n\n\n     2\n      U.S. Census Bureau, Median Household Income for States 4\n(Sept. 2009), http://www.census.gov/prod/2009pubs/acsbr08-2.pdf;\nFed. Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Dep't of Justice, Crime in the\nUnited    States,   2009   at   tbl.4   (2010),    available   at\nhttp://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/cius2009/data/table_04.html.\n     3\n      Nat'l Drug Intelligence Ctr., U.S. Dep't of Justice, Puerto\nRico/U.S. Virgin Islands High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Drug\nMarket     Analysis      2,    8     (2009),     available      at\nhttp://www.justice.gov/ndic/pubs32/32788/32788p.pdf.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fothers are unmanned and opened by a key or by an electric signal\n\noperated    by   a   buzzer    linked    to    the     residences      within    the\n\nurbanization.\n\n            In some respects, the controlled access regime is a\n\ncounterpart to the private \"gated\" residential communities that\n\nhave developed elsewhere; but in Puerto Rico the streets within the\n\narea were and remain public property, and the municipality is\n\nclosely involved in authorizing the urbanization.                      To obtain a\n\npermit,    the   residential      community     must    create     a    residents'\n\nassociation; propose a plan describing the permanent barriers and\n\naccess arrangements; file a petition supported by at least three-\n\nquarters of the residential homeowners; and assume the costs of\n\ninstalling and operating the plan.            P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23, § 64a.\n\n            The statute has various provisions directed to assuring\n\naccess, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23, §§ 64, 64c, 64g, but the most\n\nimportant provision here specifies that the controlled access plan\n\n\"shall not prevent or hinder residents from outside the community\n\nto   use   and   enjoy     sports,   recreational       and   other         community\n\ninstallations,       nor   from   obtaining      the    services       of     private\n\ninstitutions such as schools, churches, hospitals, civic clubs and\n\nothers, located in the community,\" id. § 64b(e).                    Although the\n\nCommonwealth superintends the permit process,4 each municipality\n\n\n      4\n      The Puerto Rico Planning Board issues rules for granting\ncontrolled access permits, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23, §§ 64, 64e, and\nthe Commonwealth Administration of Regulation and Permits\n\n                                        -6-\n\fafter a public hearing makes the decision whether to approve a\n\npermit application, id. § 64b.\n\n            The    Puerto    Rico      Supreme    Court       has    upheld      the\n\nconstitutionality of the Controlled Access Law, Asociación Pro\n\nControl    de   Acceso   Calle   Maracaibo,      Inc.    v.    Cardona-Rodriguez\n\n(Maracaibo), 144 D.P.R. 1 (1997), stressing that the enclosed areas\n\nremain    public   property,     id.   at    28-29,   32,     and   that   \"if   any\n\nregulation approved by any [urbanization] violates constitutionally\n\nprotected rights, the same will be considered null and void,\" id.\n\nat 27-28.       Administration of an approved regime is left to the\n\nindividual municipality and urbanization.               Id. at 26.\n\n            Dozens of municipalities have issued permits to hundreds\n\nof urbanizations that encompass in total tens of thousands of\n\nresidences. According to the Jehovah's Witnesses' unrebutted data,\n\nurbanizations range in size from a dozen residences to 300 or so,\n\nbut the average urbanization encompasses about 125 residences,\n\nwhich may be houses, apartments, or a mixture of both.                The data is\n\nnot definitive, but it appears as if about half employ guards and\n\nthe balance--likely the smaller ones--are accessible only by keys\n\nor buzzers.\n\n            The Jehovah's Witnesses have claimed from the outset that\n\nthey have often been prevented from entering urbanizations to\n\n\nadministers the Board's permitting regulations but does not direct\nthe municipalities or urbanizations in their implementation of\npermits.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fengage in constitutionally protected activity, including door-to-\n\ndoor religious proselytizing.        Some controlled access areas, they\n\nsay, can be entered only through unmanned, locked gates, and\n\nresidents may choose not to admit visitors; others have security\n\nguards who deny entry to proselytizers or who reject all visitors\n\nunless a resident or the association grants them specific approval.\n\nIn still others, it is claimed that guards intermittently deny\n\naccess to Jehovah's Witnesses.\n\n             The   Jehovah's   Witnesses     say   that    they   made   various\n\nefforts to achieve some accommodation but without success.                On May\n\n18, 2004, appellants brought suit in federal district court in\n\nPuerto Rico seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under 42\n\nU.S.C.   §   1983   (2006)     against    the   Governor    and   three    other\n\nCommonwealth-level officials.            They alleged that the Controlled\n\nAccess Law, facially and as applied, abridged their right to be\n\nsecure from unreasonable seizures and their rights to the freedoms\n\nof speech, press, association, religion, and travel.\n\n             On August 9, 2005, the district court dismissed the\n\nfacial constitutional challenges to the Controlled Access Law but\n\ndeclined to dismiss the as-applied challenges.             Watchtower Bible &\n\nTract Soc'y of N.Y. v. Sanchez Ramos, 389 F. Supp. 2d 171, 188-89\n\n(D.P.R. 2005).      Thereafter the court required the appellants to\n\ninclude as defendants municipalities and urbanizations that would\n\nbe affected by relief.         After a survey, the Jehovah's Witnesses\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\freported   that    of      the   770    controlled-access        areas   in    59\n\nmunicipalities covering 96,884 residences, they were unable to\n\naccess freely 587 urbanizations in 57 municipalities covering\n\n67,095 residences, either because a security guard denied them\n\naccess to a manned gate or because they did not have means to enter\n\nan unmanned gate.\n\n           An    amended    complaint     then   added    as    representative\n\ndefendants eleven of the municipalities and twenty-two of the\n\nurbanizations and also alleged equal protection and due process\n\nclaims.    In 2008, eight urbanization defendants agreed to grant\n\nJehovah's Witnesses \"unfettered access,\" and the district court\n\nentered default judgment against three municipalities and twelve\n\nurbanizations,     ordering      them    to   grant    Jehovah's      Witnesses\n\nunfettered access.         Appellants allege that Jehovah's Witnesses\n\nremain unable to gain access to the three defaulting municipalities\n\nand to nine of the defaulting urbanizations.\n\n           On August 10, 2009, the district court granted the\n\nremaining defendants' motions for summary judgment, dismissing the\n\ncomplaint with prejudice and awarding the defendants attorneys'\n\nfees. Watchtower Bible Tract Soc'y of N.Y., Inc. v. Sánchez-Ramos,\n\n647 F. Supp. 2d 103, 125-26 (D.P.R. 2009).             The court agreed that\n\nsome   urbanizations    have     security     guards   who     deny   access   to\n\nJehovah's Witnesses absent permission of an urbanization resident,\n\nid. at 113, 118, and that some have locked gates, which Jehovah's\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fWitnesses are unable to enter without a resident's permission, id.\n\nat 118 & n.11.     But the court concluded that these plans were\n\nacceptable because they all allowed Jehovah's Witnesses to enter if\n\nthey coordinated entry with an urbanization resident.         Id. at 118-\n\n19.\n\n            The Jehovah's Witnesses now appeal from the district\n\ncourt   orders   refusing   declaratory    and   injunctive   relief     and\n\nawarding attorneys' fees to the defendants.           They say that the\n\nstatute is facially unconstitutional but, if not, that they were\n\nentitled to injunctive relief to address \"as-applied\" restrictions\n\non access. The primary challenges pressed on appeal are based upon\n\nthe First and Fourth Amendments; but other issues are also before\n\nus including the district court's grant of attorneys' fees to the\n\ndefendants.\n\n            Threshold   Issues.     At    the   outset,   various   of   the\n\ndefending   municipalities    or   urbanizations    offer   threshold    or\n\nrelated objections to the lawsuit, all of which are without merit\n\nand most of which require little discussion. Several challenge the\n\nstanding of the plaintiff organizations to represent the interests\n\nof their Jehovah's Witnesses' members, but the appellants patently\n\nsatisfy the usual tests for association standing: the members have\n\nstanding; the interests at stake are germane to the organization's\n\npurposes; and participation of individual members is not necessary\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fto the suit.       Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Comm'n, 432 U.S.\n\n333, 343 (1977).\n\n            Some municipalities and urbanizations say that claims\n\nagainst them are moot because they have already been ordered to\n\ngrant \"unfettered access\" to Jehovah's Witnesses. But this at best\n\ncan mean that Jehovah's Witnesses are granted access if they\n\nidentify themselves and state their purpose; and among the claims\n\npressed by appellants are colorable contentions that the underlying\n\nstatute    is    unconstitutional,       that     the    permits        granted    to\n\nurbanizations are all unlawful, and that no one is entitled to ask\n\nthem any questions at all.          Right or wrong, claims of this breadth\n\ncan hardly be moot.\n\n            Some    appellees   say    that     the   appellants'       claims    are\n\npremature and others say that the claims are belated, being barred\n\nby laches or by the statutes of limitations; some also say that the\n\nclaims    are   barred   by   the    requirements       imposed    by    Monell    v.\n\nDepartment of Social Services, 436 U.S. 658 (1978), on liability\n\nfor   municipalities     or   barred    by    state-action    doctrine.           The\n\nprematurity defense rings hollow: the appellees apart from the\n\nCommonwealth are municipalities and urbanizations where access\n\nregimes have allegedly been put in place; the record contains\n\ncolorable claims that various Jehovah's Witnesses have been denied\n\naccess by defendants; and, where the challenge is to the existence\n\nof the regime itself, it can hardly be premature.\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f             Considering next the laches objection, nothing indicates\n\nthat the appellants slept on their rights to the prejudice of the\n\nappellees. Vaquería Tres Monjitas, Inc. v. Irizarry, 587 F.3d 464,\n\n480 (1st Cir. 2009).           The appellants seemingly made extensive\n\nefforts to resolve the dispute through legislative, administrative,\n\nand judicial avenues; they eventually secured consent or default\n\njudgments against some of the defendants and say that most of these\n\nhave   not   been   honored.      Nor    have   appellees    shown   injury   or\n\nprejudice from any delay.\n\n             The statute of limitations defense is not properly before\n\nus.    This appeal is from a blanket decision that bars declaratory\n\nand injunctive relief by holding the access regime constitutional\n\nas against facial and as-applied challenges.                 If it is later\n\ndetermined in light of this decision that unconstitutional actions\n\nhave occurred, there will be the time enough to consider defenses\n\nrelevant to damages--if particularized damages are ever sought.\n\n             As for municipal liability under Monell, any bar to\n\ndamage claims is beside the point because damages have not been\n\nsought.      Although   the    Supreme    Court   recently    held   that   even\n\nplaintiffs who seek only prospective relief under section 1983 must\n\nsatisfy Monell's \"policy\" or \"custom\" requirement, L.A.

But the municipal\n\npermits constitute state action. As for the urbanizations, Burton\n\nv. Wilmington Parking Authority, 365 U.S. 715 (1961), and other\n\ndecisions hold \"that actions of private entities can sometimes be\n\nregarded         as   governmental    action    for   constitutional     purposes.\"\n\nLebron v.

Passenger Corp., 513 U.S. 374, 378 (1995).\n\n                 The case law in this circuit, consistent with Supreme\n\nCourt precedent, is that the \"state actor\" label can apply where\n\nthe nominally private actor is performing an inherently public\n\nfunction, where the nominally private conduct is inextricably\n\nentangled with official public action, or where the nominally\n\nprivate conduct is compelled by state law or state actors.6                    Here,\n\n\n       5\n      Whether under Humphries ultimate injunctive relief as to as-\napplied challenges could run against the municipalities as well as\nthe urbanizations--for example, on a delegated authority theory,\nPembaur, 475 U.S. at 481-84--need hardly be determined now.\n       6\n      Sanchez v.

The public streets and sidewalks within the urbanizations\n\nremain public property for public use, see Maracaibo, 144 D.P.R. at\n\n28-29, 32, and so are traditional public forums.\n\n           The case would be different if the Commonwealth sought to\n\nalter the physical character, principal uses, or public ownership\n\nof the streets within the urbanizations to negate their status as\n\npublic forums.

Nor do the Jehovah's Witnesses deny that crime control is\n\na serious governmental interest; a \"primary concern\" of government\n\nis \"a concern for the safety and indeed the lives of its citizens,\"\n\nUnited States v. Salerno, 481 U.S. 739, 755 (1987).10       However, the\n\nJehovah's Witnesses and amicus ACLU say that the regime does not\n\nserve this interest, asserting that crime rates have increased\n\nsince the statute's adoption.\n\n          The question is whether the legislature could reasonably\n\ndeem the access control measure effective and more so than other,\n\nless intrusive alternatives.     See Vill. of Stratton, 536 U.S. at\n\n169; id. at 170-71 (Breyer, J., concurring).          Indisputably, the\n\nPuerto Rico legislature supposed that such a regime would help\n\nprotect residential neighborhoods.       See 1987 P.R. Laws 63 (Act\n\nNo. 21 Statement of Motives); see also Maracaibo, 144 D.P.R. at 28,\n\n37 (discussing the Controlled Access Law's purpose).             We cannot\n\ndeem that view unreasonable, for it is easy to suppose that some\n\n\n\n     10\n      The crime control rationale makes this case different from\nmany traditional public forum cases in which public safety was not\nseriously in issue or was not a plausible rationale. E.g., Vill. of\nStratton, 536 U.S. at 169; id. at 170-71 (Breyer, J., concurring);\nGrace, 461 U.S. at 182; Martin v. City of Struthers, 319 U.S. 141,\n144-47 (1943); Schneider v. State (Town of Irvington), 308 U.S.\n147, 162 (1939); Lovell v.

Such a challenge\n\nordinarily requires that the statute be invalid in every possible\n\napplication or, in some First Amendment contexts, that it be\n\nclearly overbroad in some applications that cannot or should not be\n\nsevered.   Members of the City Council of L.A. v. Taxpayers for\n\nVincent, 466 U.S. 789, 796 (1984); McGuire v. Reilly, 260 F.3d 36,\n\n47 (1st Cir. 2001).      \"Some applications\" refers to applications\n\nembedded in the statute.\n\n           Here,   the   statute   explicitly   confirms   that   innocent\n\nvisits are permitted, P.R.

Nothing in the statute\n\nendorses the principal inhibitions of which appellants complain.\n\nThe statute says nothing of unmanned locked gates or buzzers\n\ncontrolled solely by residents, nor does it empower guards to deny\n\naccess unless a resident approves.

Narrow        tailoring,    which      forbids\n\nburdening substantially more speech than necessary, Asociación de\n\nEducación Privada de P.R., Inc. v. García-Padilla, 490 F.3d 1, 16\n\n(1st      Cir.    2007),    may    require       reasonable     tempering        at    the\n\napplication stage.\n\n             The first problem is the use in some urbanizations of\n\nexclusively a key or buzzer system that gives residents a veto\n\nright over access.          A regime of locked, unmanned gates completely\n\nbarring     access     to     public    streets     will    preclude       all    direct\n\ncommunicative       activity      by   non-residents       in   traditional       public\n\nforums, and, absent a more specific showing, cannot be deemed\n\n\"narrowly        tailored.\"       Thus,    a     manned    guard     gate    for      each\n\nurbanization is required, unless the urbanization carries a burden\n\nof special justification.\n\n             Conceivably, a controlled access area might be very\n\nsmall,     its    residents'      resources      very    limited,    or     both:     some\n\nurbanizations have as few as one or two dozen residences.                             The\n\n\n                                          -20-\n\fdistrict court will have to determine whether and when it is\n\nreasonable to rely only on a buzzer system or some limited guard\n\naccess (say, for a few hours a day on predesignated days each\n\nweek). Finding such accommodations is best done with help from the\n\nparties, but the district court can certainly set general standards\n\nand categories without area by area adjudications.\n\n          As the statute places no restriction on the size of an\n\nurbanization, the presumption--even if rebuttable--is in favor of\n\nsome access, cf. Frisby, 487 U.S. at 486 (generally directed\n\nexpression \"may not be completely banned in [public] residential\n\nareas\"); Perry Educ. Ass'n, 460 U.S. at 45 (in traditional public\n\nforums   \"the   government   may    not   prohibit   all   communicative\n\nactivity\").     And, in proposals for exemption or very limited\n\naccess, the urbanization proposing the limitation should come\n\nforward with a proposal and bear the burden of justification.\n\n          As for guarded gates, the Jehovah's Witnesses say that\n\nsome deny access to all Jehovah's Witnesses--or anyone else not\n\napproved by a local resident; others (allegedly) admit or deny\n\naccess at the guards' whim.    In our view, a security guard may ask\n\na non-resident visitor where the visitor is headed and also to\n\nstate the purpose of the visit.      And, although a closer question,\n\nwe think that the Constitution permits a guard to ask a visitor for\n\nhis or her name and identification--a question often asked at the\n\nentrance of public federal buildings like courthouses, United\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fStates v. Smith, 426 F.3d 567, 570, 574-75 (2d Cir. 2005), cert.\n\ndenied, 546 U.S. 1204 (2006).12\n\n               True, an automatic request for the visitor's name poses\n\na close question, given case law recognizing a right of anonymous\n\nspeech.13      But the cases are distinguishable: giving a guard a name\n\nand identification is a narrower and less threatening imposition on\n\nprivacy than requiring one to register for a permit, to wear an\n\nidentification badge in distributing literature, or to disclose\n\nmembership information. And the request is more closely related to\n\nthe security rationale than the weaker purposes that lay behind the\n\nobligations that the Supreme Court disallowed.\n\n                 Still, the safer course would be to ask for names and\n\nidentification only where cause exists.           If a guard does have a\n\nreasonable suspicion (based on objective circumstances) that a non-\n\nresident visitor may engage in criminal activity, the guard may\n\ninsist on answers to more intrusive questions as a condition of\n\naccess    or    may   withhold   access   while   calling   the   police   to\n\n\n     12\n      The Puerto Rico Supreme Court may have disallowed name and\nidentification requests save in a more limited class of cases,\nMaracaibo, 144 D.P.R. at 38, although presumably not where the\nguard has a reasonable suspicion. To the extent that the Puerto\nRico Supreme Court's determination rests on local law, we have no\nauthority to immunize urbanizations.\n     13\n      See, e.g., Vill. of Stratton, 536 U.S. at 166-67; Buckley v.\nAm. Constitutional Law Found., Inc., 525 U.S. 182, 197-204 (1999);\nMcIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U.S. 334, 341-47 (1995);\nTalley v. California, 362 U.S. 60, 62-65 (1960); Bates v.

Objective circumstances also serve to ensure that any\n\nrestriction on access is sufficiently cabined so that guards do not\n\nexercise undue discretion. See Thomas v. Chi. Park Dist., 534 U.S.\n\n316, 323 (2002).\n\n           Such limited questions do not violate the Jehovah's\n\nWitnesses'     rights   of    free   speech,     including      anonymous   or\n\nspontaneous speech.      The narrow tailoring rule is that a time-\n\nplace-manner restriction may not burden substantially more than\n\nnecessary to serve its purpose, not that it may not burden speech\n\nat all.   Asociación de Educación Privada, 490 F.3d at 16 (citing\n\nWard, 491 U.S. at 800).        By contrast to the regime disallowed in\n\nVillage   of    Stratton,    here    no     registration   is    imposed    and\n\nsignificant delay will occur only where there is a fact-specific\n\nbasis for it.\n\n           Turning now to the Jehovah's Witnesses' Fourth Amendment\n\nchallenge, they say that they are subject to an unlawful \"seizure\"\n\nwhen they are brought to a halt at access points set up around the\n\nenclosures.     The Fourth Amendment applies to Puerto Rico through\n\nthe Fourteenth Amendment. Maldonado v. Fontanes, 568 F.3d 263, 270\n\nn.2 (1st Cir. 2009).        As already explained, the use of nominally\n\nprivate guards does not avoid the issue because the urbanizations\n\nand their guards qualify as state actors under the public function\n\ntest.

Beerman, 18 F.3d 147, 153\n\n(2d Cir.), cert. denied, 513 U.S. 816 (1994) (excluded visitor not\n\n\"seized\" where \"'free to go anywhere else that he desired,' with\n\nthe exception of [the judge's] chambers and the court house\"). The\n\nJehovah's Witnesses, in response, rely mainly on cases involving\n\npolice roadblocks of vehicles, but these cases say or assume that\n\ndetention--at least temporary detention--is the design or effect.\n\n          Often   a   roadblock   is     aimed   directly   at   arresting\n\nviolators in the vehicle, and--even without this motive--the usual\n\nroadblock effects an intentional detention or \"seizure\" of the\n\nvehicle and those within it.14    No one thus halted imagines himself\n\nfree merely to turn and drive away without permission. As Delaware\n\nv. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648 (1979), explained, \"[t]he Fourth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments are implicated in this case because stopping\n\nan automobile and detaining its occupants constitute a 'seizure'\n\nwithin the meaning of those Amendments, even though the purpose of\n\n\n     14\n      E.g., City of Indianapolis v. Edmond, 531 U.S. 32 (2000)\n(roadblock to detect drug trafficking); Mich. Dep't of State Police\nv. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444 (1990) (roadblock to detect drunk driving);\nUnited States v. Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. 543, 556 (1976)\n(roadblock to detect unlawful immigration); see also Illinois v.\nLidster, 540 U.S. 419 (2004) (roadblock to seek information about\nhit-and-run crime).\n\n                                  -24-\n\fthe stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief.\"       Id.\n\nat 653.   In other cases, the premise is implicit.15\n\n           By   contrast,   a   Jehovah's   Witness   halted   at   an\n\nurbanization barrier need not answer questions or remain at the\n\nbarrier; anyone so questioned is free to walk or to drive away.      As\n\nlong as a reasonable person would feel free to leave or, if not\n\ndesiring to leave, would feel free to terminate the encounter, no\n\nFourth Amendment seizure has occurred. Brendlin v. California, 551\n\nU.S. 249, 255 (2007).       This is so even if refusal to answer\n\nquestions precludes entry into the urbanization.       In a different\n\ncontext, United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544 (1980), Justice\n\nStewart stated:\n\n           As long as the person to whom questions are\n           put remains free to disregard the questions\n           and walk away, there has been no intrusion\n           upon that person's liberty or privacy as would\n           under    the   Constitution    require    some\n           particularized and objective justification.\n\nId. at 554 (principal opinion).16\n\n\n     15\n      E.g., Lidster, 540 U.S. at 422, 425 (information-seeking\nroadblock deemed a compelled stop of each vehicle followed by a\ndetention of its occupants for brief questioning); Edmond, 531 U.S.\nat 35 (drug-interdiction roadblock described as compelling an\ninvoluntary stop followed by an open-view examination and detention\nfor five minutes or less); Sitz, 496 U.S. at 447 (sobriety\nroadblock called an involuntary stop followed by a brief detention\nand examination for signs of intoxication).\n     16\n      See United States v. Faulkner, 450 F.3d 466, 469-70 (9th Cir.\n2006) (information-station roadblock at a national park entrance\ninvolved a seizure because a reasonable person would have believed\nthat he was not free to leave the information station); Maxwell v.\nCity of New York, 102 F.3d 664, 668 n.2 (2d Cir. 1996), cert.\n\n                                 -25-\n\f            Pertinently, see California v. Hodari D., 499 U.S. 621,\n\n626 & n.2 (1991), at common law an arrest required confinement\n\n(actual or constructive), and merely \"preventing another from going\n\nin a particular direction\" would not itself qualify.            Restatement\n\n(Second) of Torts § 36(3) (1965) (discussing false imprisonment, a\n\ncommon law tort for unlawful arrest); see Perkins, The Law of\n\nArrest, 25 Iowa L. Rev. 201, 203 (1940).            After police officers\n\nenclosed and blocked a footpath, a trespass action for unlawful\n\ndetention failed, the court holding that no confinement occurs when\n\n\"one man merely obstructs the passage of another in a particular\n\ndirection . . . leaving him at liberty to stay where he is or to go\n\nin any other direction if he pleases.\"         Bird v. Jones, (1845) 115\n\nEng.

But see Mills v.\nDistrict of Columbia, 571 F.3d 1304, 1308 (D.C. Cir. 2009)\n(assuming without discussion that a neighborhood-safety checkpoint\nwas a seizure).\n\n                                    -26-\n\fcomponent of reasonableness in every circumstance.\" Nat'l Treasury\n\nEmps. Union v. Von Raab, 489 U.S. 656, 665 (1989) (emphasis added).\n\n                Where   the   aim   is   other   than    detecting     evidence     of\n\nordinary criminal wrongdoing to apprehend violators, see Lidster,\n\n540 U.S. at 423, the Court weighs \"the gravity of the public\n\nconcerns served by the seizure, the degree to which the seizure\n\nadvances the public interest, and the severity of the interference\n\nwith     individual      liberty.\"17      The    Court    has    upheld   vehicular\n\nroadblocks and brief inquiries of all drivers, without individual\n\nprobable cause or suspicion, for certain purposes and with certain\n\nsafeguards.        United States v. William, 603 F.3d 66, 68 (1st Cir.\n\n2010).\n\n                Here, the purpose is to protect communities endangered by\n\ncrime; but the means--the barriers--are designed not to secure the\n\narrest of would-be criminals but merely to ask entrants to explain\n\ntheir        purpose,   and   the   \"seizure\"    (if     one    is   assumed   to   be\n\noccurring) involves no \"detention\" because the would-be entrant is\n\nnot held or searched but remains free to leave.                  Cf. United States\n\nv. Fraire, 575 F.3d 929, 933 (9th Cir. 2009) (upholding checkpoint\n\nat national park entrance to deter poachers because \"[t]he goal was\n\nprevention, not arrests\").\n\n\n\n\n        17\n      Brown v. Texas, 443 U.S. 47, 51 (1979); see also Lidster, 540\nU.S. at 427-28 (balancing these factors); Sitz, 496 U.S. at 450-55\n(same); Martinez-Fuerte, 428 U.S. at 556-64 (same).\n\n                                         -27-\n\f           There is a long history of general area-entry searches.\n\nSee generally 5 W. LaFave, Search and Seizure §§ 10.6-10.7, at 278-\n\n331 (4th ed. 2004).       Especially pertinent is language in Chandler\n\nv. Miller, 520 U.S. 305 (1997), where the Supreme Court, although\n\ninvalidating Georgia's requirement that candidates for state office\n\npass drug tests, reiterated that\n\n           where the risk to public safety is substantial\n           and real, blanket suspicionless searches\n           calibrated   to   the    risk  may   rank   as\n           \"reasonable\"--for    example,   searches   now\n           routine at airports and at entrances to courts\n           and other official buildings.\n\nId. at 323.   Compared to an airport search, a few questions about\n\nidentity and purpose for entering an urbanization seem tame indeed.\n\n           In sum, the case before us is novel and difficult.           But\n\nPuerto   Rico's   crime    problems   are   unusually   serious   and   its\n\nlegislature's solution, albeit an experiment, was democratically\n\nadopted and is far from irrational.         A court's task is to assure\n\nbreathing room for legitimate communicative activity.        Although we\n\nreject the facial challenge to the statute, the precedents on\n\naccess to public places require fine tuning of the statute's local\n\nadministration and, for that, further proceedings are required.\n\n           On remand the district court needs to take prompt action\n\nto bring the municipalities and urbanizations into compliance with\n\nthis decision.    In the case of urbanizations that already provide\n\nregularly manned guard gates, they must provide entry to Jehovah's\n\nWitnesses who disclose their purpose and identity, subject only to\n\n                                   -28-\n\fthe limitations already set forth above.              It is unclear why it\n\nshould    take   any   substantial   time   in     such   cases   to   give   the\n\nnecessary instruction or what excuse could be given for failing to\n\nmake a good faith effort at prompt implementation.\n\n            Where an urbanization currently provides access only\n\nthrough a locked gate or a buzzer operated solely by residents,\n\nadjustment may take longer.          Those prepared to provide guards\n\nduring daylight hours need a brief period to hire and to train\n\nthem.     And any urbanization that seeks to justify more limited\n\naccess arrangements (for example, manned gates for limited periods\n\non designated days) or an exemption because of small size needs a\n\nchance to propose and defend such a request.              The district court\n\ncan adopt categorical guidelines and make use of magistrate judges\n\nor other facilitators as needed.\n\n            To assure compliance might seem a daunting task because\n\nof the number of urbanizations, but we would expect the district\n\ncourt--if confronted with undue delay or repeated noncompliance--\n\npromptly to direct open access for all visitors unless and until\n\nthe     urbanization    brings   itself     into    compliance.        Further,\n\nunreasonable delay creates a risk of contempt and of damages and\n\nattorneys' fees, 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b); see Boston's Children First\n\nv. City of Boston, 395 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2005), providing an\n\nadditional incentive for defendants to act promptly.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\f          Accordingly, we affirm the district court's dismissal of\n\nthe facial challenge to the Controlled Access Law but vacate the\n\ndistrict court order denying declaratory and injunctive relief on\n\nthe as-applied claims; we also vacate the order granting attorneys'\n\nfees and costs against the Jehovah's Witnesses because its premise\n\nis undermined by our decision; and we remand the case for further\n\nproceedings consistent with this decision.   Each side has obtained\n\nsomething from this appeal and each shall bear its own costs.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -30-\n\f",

To abate crime, Puerto Rico\n\nadopted a Controlled Access Law, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 23, §§ 64-64h\n\n(2008), allowing local entities (called \"urbanizations\"), organized\n\nby the community but approved by the municipality, to control\n\nstreet access to areas within towns that have voted in favor of\n\nsuch plans.    Appellants are two corporations operated by the\n\nGoverning Body of Jehovah's Witnesses1 that challenged in federal\n\ndistrict court both the statute and its application.    Apart from\n\ndefault or consent judgments against some of the defendants, the\n\ndistrict court denied relief.    The background is as follows.\n\n           Jehovah's Witnesses accept a religious duty to share the\n\nBible's message publicly and to proselytize from house to house.\n\nWatchtower Bible & Tract Soc'y of N.Y., Inc. v.

They engage in door-to-door ministry,\n\ncommunicate about the Bible with people on public streets, and\n\noffer religious literature to anyone interested in reading it.\n\nThey say that their activities in Puerto Rico have been constrained\n\nby urbanizations acting pursuant to the Controlled Access Law that\n\nis the subject of this appeal.\n\n\n     1\n      Watchtower Bible and Tract Society of New York, Inc.\ncoordinates the preaching activities of Jehovah's Witnesses\nthroughout the United States and publishes widely distributed\nreligious literature. Congregación Cristiana de los Testigos de\nJehová de Puerto Rico, Inc. oversees the 318 congregations of\nJehovah's Witnesses in Puerto Rico, which have about 25,000\nmembers.\n\n                                 -4-\n\f           The Controlled Access Law--adopted in 1987 and amended in\n\n1988, 1992, 1997, and 1998--was prompted by and adopted against a\n\nbackground of endemic violent crime.            Puerto Rico, with a median\n\nhousehold income only about one-third of the U.S. national average\n\nand less than half of every other state, has a homicide rate\n\nquadruple the U.S. national rate and more than double that of\n\nvirtually every state.2      It is a major drug transit point, and drug\n\ndealing has led in a number of cases to corruption among local\n\npolice.3\n\n           The    statute,      as    currently      amended,    authorizes\n\nmunicipalities    to   grant    permits    to    neighborhood   homeowners'\n\nassociations     called   urbanizations     to     control   vehicular   and\n\npedestrian access to the public residential streets within the\n\nurbanization (the term referring either to the association or to\n\nthe controlled area).

A regime of locked, unmanned gates completely\n\nbarring     access     to     public    streets     will    preclude       all    direct\n\ncommunicative       activity      by   non-residents       in   traditional       public\n\nforums, and, absent a more specific showing, cannot be deemed\n\n\"narrowly        tailored.\"       Thus,    a     manned    guard     gate    for      each\n\nurbanization is required, unless the urbanization carries a burden\n\nof special justification.\n\n             Conceivably, a controlled access area might be very\n\nsmall,     its    residents'      resources      very    limited,    or     both:     some\n\nurbanizations have as few as one or two dozen residences.                             The\n\n\n                                          -20-\n\fdistrict court will have to determine whether and when it is\n\nreasonable to rely only on a buzzer system or some limited guard\n\naccess (say, for a few hours a day on predesignated days each\n\nweek). Finding such accommodations is best done with help from the\n\nparties, but the district court can certainly set general standards\n\nand categories without area by area adjudications.\n\n          As the statute places no restriction on the size of an\n\nurbanization, the presumption--even if rebuttable--is in favor of\n\nsome access, cf. Frisby, 487 U.S. at 486 (generally directed\n\nexpression \"may not be completely banned in [public] residential\n\nareas\"); Perry Educ. Ass'n, 460 U.S. at 45 (in traditional public\n\nforums   \"the   government   may    not   prohibit   all   communicative\n\nactivity\").     And, in proposals for exemption or very limited\n\naccess, the urbanization proposing the limitation should come\n\nforward with a proposal and bear the burden of justification.\n\n          As for guarded gates, the Jehovah's Witnesses say that\n\nsome deny access to all Jehovah's Witnesses--or anyone else not\n\napproved by a local resident; others (allegedly) admit or deny\n\naccess at the guards' whim.    In our view, a security guard may ask\n\na non-resident visitor where the visitor is headed and also to\n\nstate the purpose of the visit.      And, although a closer question,\n\nwe think that the Constitution permits a guard to ask a visitor for\n\nhis or her name and identification--a question often asked at the\n\nentrance of public federal buildings like courthouses, United\n\n\n                                   -21-\n\fStates v.

And the request is more closely related to\n\nthe security rationale than the weaker purposes that lay behind the\n\nobligations that the Supreme Court disallowed.\n\n                 Still, the safer course would be to ask for names and\n\nidentification only where cause exists.           If a guard does have a\n\nreasonable suspicion (based on objective circumstances) that a non-\n\nresident visitor may engage in criminal activity, the guard may\n\ninsist on answers to more intrusive questions as a condition of\n\naccess    or    may   withhold   access   while   calling   the   police   to\n\n\n     12\n      The Puerto Rico Supreme Court may have disallowed name and\nidentification requests save in a more limited class of cases,\nMaracaibo, 144 D.P.R. at 38, although presumably not where the\nguard has a reasonable suspicion.

Compared to an airport search, a few questions about\n\nidentity and purpose for entering an urbanization seem tame indeed.\n\n           In sum, the case before us is novel and difficult.           But\n\nPuerto   Rico's   crime    problems   are   unusually   serious   and   its\n\nlegislature's solution, albeit an experiment, was democratically\n\nadopted and is far from irrational.         A court's task is to assure\n\nbreathing room for legitimate communicative activity.        Although we\n\nreject the facial challenge to the statute, the precedents on\n\naccess to public places require fine tuning of the statute's local\n\nadministration and, for that, further proceedings are required.\n\n           On remand the district court needs to take prompt action\n\nto bring the municipalities and urbanizations into compliance with\n\nthis decision.    In the case of urbanizations that already provide\n\nregularly manned guard gates, they must provide entry to Jehovah's\n\nWitnesses who disclose their purpose and identity, subject only to\n\n                                   -28-\n\fthe limitations already set forth above.              It is unclear why it\n\nshould    take   any   substantial   time   in     such   cases   to   give   the\n\nnecessary instruction or what excuse could be given for failing to\n\nmake a good faith effort at prompt implementation.\n\n            Where an urbanization currently provides access only\n\nthrough a locked gate or a buzzer operated solely by residents,\n\nadjustment may take longer.          Those prepared to provide guards\n\nduring daylight hours need a brief period to hire and to train\n\nthem.     And any urbanization that seeks to justify more limited\n\naccess arrangements (for example, manned gates for limited periods\n\non designated days) or an exemption because of small size needs a\n\nchance to propose and defend such a request.              The district court\n\ncan adopt categorical guidelines and make use of magistrate judges\n\nor other facilitators as needed.\n\n            To assure compliance might seem a daunting task because\n\nof the number of urbanizations, but we would expect the district\n\ncourt--if confronted with undue delay or repeated noncompliance--\n\npromptly to direct open access for all visitors unless and until\n\nthe     urbanization    brings   itself     into    compliance.
