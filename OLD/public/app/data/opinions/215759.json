Eduardo de Jesús Díaz Ruano, a Guatemalan\n\nnational, seeks judicial review of an order of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA) denying his application for withholding\n\nof removal and protection under Article III of the United Nations\n\nConvention Against Torture (CAT).          After careful consideration, we\n\ndeny the petition.\n\n           We draw the facts largely from the petitioner's testimony\n\nbefore the immigration judge (IJ).\n\n           During his formative years, the petitioner lived in the\n\nvillage of San Pedro Ayampuc, where he worked on his father's farm.\n\nOver time, criminal gangs became an insidious influence in the\n\nregion.    In 2003, one such gang turned its attention to the\n\npetitioner's village.\n\n           The gang tried unsuccessfully to recruit one of the\n\npetitioner's friends.     The gang then threatened to beat the friend\n\nif he did not join.     The recalcitrant recruit responded by fleeing\n\nthe country.\n\n           The petitioner feared that the gang, members of which\n\nfrequently had seen him and his friend together, would focus on him\n\nnext.     This   fear   became   a   reality;   the   gang   confronted   the\n\npetitioner to determine the friend's whereabouts.            The petitioner\n\nwould not divulge this information, and the gang threatened him\n\nwith violence.      The petitioner reported this incident to the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fpolice.   They paid him a visit but told him that there was not\n\nenough evidence to pursue the matter.\n\n          When the gang beat a friend so severely that he required\n\nhospitalization,1 the petitioner, who was then eighteen years of\n\nage, decided to flee to the United States.    He believed that the\n\ngangs were ubiquitous throughout Guatemala and feared that he would\n\nnot find a safe haven elsewhere in his homeland.\n\n          The petitioner entered the United States in 2003, without\n\ninspection.   Federal authorities commenced removal proceedings\n\nagainst him in 2006.   He conceded removability and cross-applied\n\nfor withholding of removal and protection under the CAT.     He did\n\nnot seek asylum, presumably because the one-year deadline had\n\npassed by then.   See 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1), (2)(B).\n\n          After an evidentiary hearing, the IJ denied the cross-\n\napplication, holding that the petitioner was not eligible for\n\neither withholding of removal or protection under the CAT.\n\n          The petitioner's administrative appeal came to naught.\n\nThe BIA, on de novo review, confirmed that he had not demonstrated\n\neligibility for either form of relief.   This timely petition for\n\njudicial review followed.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      The record is unclear as to the details of this incident and\nwhom it involved.\n\n                                -3-\n\f           The petitioner challenges both facets of the BIA's ukase.\n\nWe address his claims sequentially.              We start, however, with the\n\nstandard of review.\n\n           We review the agency's factual findings through the prism\n\nof the substantial evidence rule.             INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S.\n\n478, 481 (1992).        Viewed through that prism, we will accept those\n\nfindings unless the record as a whole would compel a reasonable\n\nfactfinder to reach a contrary conclusion.              Id.   Questions of law\n\nengender   de    novo    review,      with    some   deference    to   the   BIA's\n\ninterpretation of statutes and regulations that fall within its\n\npurview.   Elien v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 392, 396-97 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           The   first     of   the    petitioner's     assignments     of   error\n\nimplicates the denial of withholding of removal.                   The relevant\n\nlegal framework is familiar.\n\n           An alien who seeks withholding of removal may not be\n\ndeported if, upon repatriation, his life or freedom would be\n\nthreatened on account of any one of five statutorily protected\n\ngrounds:   race,    religion,      nationality,       political    opinion,     or\n\nmembership in a social group.                See 8 U.S.C. § 1231(b)(3)(A); 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1208.16(b); Pulisir v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 302, 308 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).     The alien bears the burden of showing that there is a\n\n\"clear probability\" that such persecution will transpire.2                   INS v.\n\n\n     2\n       In the withholding of removal context, a \"threat to life or\nfreedom\" is functionally equivalent to \"persecution\" in the asylum\ncontext, Wiratama v. Mukasey, 538 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 2008), and we\n\n                                        -4-\n\fStevic, 467 U.S. 407, 430 (1984).               This entails a showing of a\n\nprospect of serious harm or jeopardy, not mere discomfiture,\n\nunpleasantness, ordinary harassment, or unfair treatment.                  López\n\nPérez v. Holder, 587 F.3d 456, 461 (1st Cir. 2009); López de\n\nHincapie v. Gonzales, 494 F.3d 213, 217 (1st Cir. 2007).                 It also\n\nentails a showing of some connection between the government and the\n\nanticipated    harm,    whether      by    participation,     acquiescence,   or\n\ncondonation.    See, e.g., López Pérez, 587 F.3d at 462; Raza v.\n\nGonzales, 484 F.3d 125, 129 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          We turn now from the general to the specific.                       The\n\npetitioner    asserts    that   he    fears     persecution    because   of   his\n\nmembership in a social group composed of \"young male[s] sought out\n\nfor information and recruitment by the criminal gang of Guatemala.\"\n\nAs we explain below, this definition does not describe a social\n\ngroup within the taxonomy of the statute.\n\n          To begin, the BIA has determined that members of a\n\ncognizable social group must share one or more common, immutable\n\ncharacteristics that make the group sufficiently particular and\n\nsocially visible.       Matter of E-A-G-, 24 I. & N. Dec. 591, 593-94\n\n(BIA 2008); Matter of S-E-G-, 24 I. & N. Dec. 579, 582-83 (BIA\n\n2008); see generally Matter of Acosta, 19 I. & N. Dec. 211, 232-34\n\n(BIA 1985).     We have pronounced this requirement an acceptable\n\n\n\nuse the terms interchangeably. The required degree of probability\nis, however, higher for withholding of removal. Id.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fgloss on the statutory language.        See Faye v. Holder, 580 F.3d 37,\n\n41 (1st Cir. 2009); Scatambuli v. Holder, 558 F.3d 53, 59 (1st Cir.\n\n2009); Da Silva v. Ashcroft, 394 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2005).              The\n\ngroup proposed by the petitioner does not satisfy this criterion.\n\n          Phrases      that    are      open-ended     and    subject     to\n\ninterpretation, such as \"recruitment\" potential and \"information\"\n\nthat might be attractive to a gang, are not sufficiently particular\n\nto describe a cognizable social group.            See Ahmed v. Holder, 611\n\nF.3d 90, 94 (1st Cir. 2010).        Such loose and inherently subjective\n\ndescriptions do not \"permit an accurate separation of members from\n\nnon-members.\"    Id.   Because their boundaries are neither clearly\n\ndemarcated nor self-elucidating, they do not delimit a cognizable\n\nsocial group.    See Mendez-Barrera v. Holder, 602 F.3d 21, 27 (1st\n\nCir. 2010); see generally Faye, 580 F.3d at 41-42 (noting that\n\nterms such as \"wealthy\" and \"affluent\" are too vague to define a\n\nsocial group).\n\n          Moreover,    the    age    parameters    (\"young   male[s]\")   are\n\nsimilarly lacking in precision.        One who is \"young\" in the eyes of\n\none observer may not be \"young\" in the eyes of another observer.3\n\nIn addition, the age parameters span a period of several years, and\n\nthe petitioner makes no effort to account for the gap between his\n\ndifficulties with the gang (at age eighteen) and his age at\n\n\n     3\n       For example, a twenty-five year old may be \"young\" in the\neyes of an octogenarian, but \"old\" in the eyes of a third-grade\nstudent.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fpossible repatriation (he is now in his mid-twenties).    See Matter\n\nof S-E-G-, 24 I. & N. Dec. at 583-84.\n\n          To cinch matters, the petitioner has not demonstrated\n\nthat his putative social group has the requisite social visibility.\n\nIn order to satisfy the requirements for a social group, an alien\n\nmust show that the relevant community (here, Guatemala) views the\n\ndescribed group as a discrete class.     See Castañeda-Castillo v.\n\nHolder, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2011) [No. 09-1847, slip op. at\n\n20]; Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, 542 F.3d 738, 746 (9th Cir. 2008).\n\nA social group must be more than an empty description or string of\n\nwords; it must be a group of people publicly recognized as such in\n\nthe relevant community.   See Ahmed, 611 F.3d at 94.   The petitioner\n\nhas failed to make this showing with respect to \"young male[s]\n\nsought out for information and recruitment.\"\n\n          If more were needed — and it plainly is not — the\n\npetitioner's claim for withholding of removal is deficient in\n\nanother respect: he has failed to tie mistreatment at the hands of\n\nthe gang to the Guatemalan government.   He makes no assertion that\n\nthe government is directly responsible for the activities of the\n\ngang.   Thus, he must show governmental acquiescence: that the\n\ngovernment is either unwilling or unable to control the gang's\n\nmisconduct.   See Jorgji v. Mukasey, 514 F.3d 53, 57 (1st Cir.\n\n2008); Orelien v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d 67, 72 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f            The   only    evidence    bearing    on   this   point   is   the\n\npetitioner's testimony that when he notified the police of his\n\nconfrontation with the gang, their response was stymied by a\n\nprofessed lack of evidence.          Building on this porous foundation,\n\nthe petitioner urges us to conclude that the police acquiesced in\n\nthe gang's conduct.\n\n            We resist that exhortation.         The vignette relied on by\n\nthe petitioner does not compel the conclusion that the government\n\nwas either unable or unwilling to control the gang.          It is at least\n\nas plausible to infer that the police were ready, willing, and able\n\nto follow up, but could not do so with the scanty information that\n\nthe petitioner was able to provide.         A reasonable factfinder would\n\nnot be compelled to conclude that the police condoned the gang's\n\nmischief.    The BIA's contrary conclusion is, therefore, supported\n\nby substantial evidence.        See Morgan v. Holder, 634 F.3d 53, 59\n\n(1st Cir. 2011).\n\n            This brings us to the petitioner's second assignment of\n\nerror: the rejection of his CAT claim.          To prevail on such a claim,\n\nan alien must show that, more likely than not, he will be tortured\n\nupon repatriation.       8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2); Romilus v. Ashcroft,\n\n385 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2004).        For CAT purposes, \"torture\" is any\n\nact that inflicts severe physical or mental pain, \"when such pain\n\nor suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the\n\nconsent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fin an official capacity.\"              8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a); see Chhay v.\n\nMukasey, 540 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2008).                Consequently, the alien\n\nmust show not only that the feared harm would amount to torture but\n\nalso       that    it   would   have   a   legally   sufficient   nexus   to   the\n\ngovernment.\n\n                  We need not probe these points.          In this case, the\n\npetitioner has made no meaningful effort to satisfy the applicable\n\nstandard.          While his brief makes a conclusory reference to the\n\ninsupportability of the BIA's ruling denying him CAT protection, it\n\nis devoid of any developed argumentation regarding this claim.\n\nGiven this failing, we deem the claim abandoned.4                   See Pan v.\n\nGonzales, 489 F.3d 80, 87 (1st Cir. 2007); Jiang v. Gonzales, 474\n\nF.3d 25, 32 (1st Cir. 2007); see also United States v. Zannino, 895\n\nF.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                  We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe deny the petition for judicial review.\n\n\n\nSo Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n        We note in passing that in view of the petitioner's\ninability to show either governmental involvement or acquiescence\nin the gang's conduct, see text supra, it seems clear that, on this\nrecord, he could not in any event show the requisite link between\nthe claimed \"torture\" and the Guatemalan government.\n\n                                           -9-\n\f",

This entails a showing of a\n\nprospect of serious harm or jeopardy, not mere discomfiture,\n\nunpleasantness, ordinary harassment, or unfair treatment.                  López\n\nPérez v.

It also\n\nentails a showing of some connection between the government and the\n\nanticipated    harm,    whether      by    participation,     acquiescence,   or\n\ncondonation.    See, e.g., López Pérez, 587 F.3d at 462; Raza v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202713\"><a href=\"/opinion/202713/raza-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 129 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          We turn now from the general to the specific.                       The\n\npetitioner    asserts    that   he    fears     persecution    because   of   his\n\nmembership in a social group composed of \"young male[s] sought out\n\nfor information and recruitment by the criminal gang of Guatemala.\"\n\nAs we explain below, this definition does not describe a social\n\ngroup within the taxonomy of the statute.\n\n          To begin, the BIA has determined that members of a\n\ncognizable social group must share one or more common, immutable\n\ncharacteristics that make the group sufficiently particular and\n\nsocially visible.       Matter of E-A-G-, 24 I. & N. Dec. 591, 593-94\n\n(BIA 2008); Matter of S-E-G-, 24 I. & N. Dec. 579, 582-83 (BIA\n\n2008); see generally Matter of Acosta, 19 I. & N. Dec. 211, 232-34\n\n(BIA 1985).     We have pronounced this requirement an acceptable\n\n\n\nuse the terms interchangeably. The required degree of probability\nis, however, higher for withholding of removal. Id.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fgloss on the statutory language.        See Faye v.

The\n\ngroup proposed by the petitioner does not satisfy this criterion.\n\n          Phrases      that    are      open-ended     and    subject     to\n\ninterpretation, such as \"recruitment\" potential and \"information\"\n\nthat might be attractive to a gang, are not sufficiently particular\n\nto describe a cognizable social group.            See Ahmed v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"150524\"><a href=\"/opinion/150524/ahmed-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">611</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 94 (1st Cir. 2010).        Such loose and inherently subjective\n\ndescriptions do not \"permit an accurate separation of members from\n\nnon-members.\"    Id.   Because their boundaries are neither clearly\n\ndemarcated nor self-elucidating, they do not delimit a cognizable\n\nsocial group.    See Mendez-Barrera v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145535\"><a href=\"/opinion/145535/mendez-barrera-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">602</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 27 (1st\n\nCir. 2010); see generally Faye, 580 F.3d at 41-42 (noting that\n\nterms such as \"wealthy\" and \"affluent\" are too vague to define a\n\nsocial group).\n\n          Moreover,    the    age    parameters    (\"young   male[s]\")   are\n\nsimilarly lacking in precision.        One who is \"young\" in the eyes of\n\none observer may not be \"young\" in the eyes of another observer.3\n\nIn addition, the age parameters span a period of several years, and\n\nthe petitioner makes no effort to account for the gap between his\n\ndifficulties with the gang (at age eighteen) and his age at\n\n\n     3\n       For example, a twenty-five year old may be \"young\" in the\neyes of an octogenarian, but \"old\" in the eyes of a third-grade\nstudent.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fpossible repatriation (he is now in his mid-twenties).    See Matter\n\nof S-E-G-, 24 I. & N. Dec. at 583-84.\n\n          To cinch matters, the petitioner has not demonstrated\n\nthat his putative social group has the requisite social visibility.\n\nIn order to satisfy the requirements for a social group, an alien\n\nmust show that the relevant community (here, Guatemala) views the\n\ndescribed group as a discrete class.     See Castañeda-Castillo v.\n\nHolder, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2011) [No. 09-1847, slip op. at\n\n20]; Santos-Lemus v. Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1437538\"><a href=\"/opinion/1437538/santos-lemus-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 746 (9th Cir. 2008).\n\nA social group must be more than an empty description or string of\n\nwords; it must be a group of people publicly recognized as such in\n\nthe relevant community.   See Ahmed, 611 F.3d at 94.   The petitioner\n\nhas failed to make this showing with respect to \"young male[s]\n\nsought out for information and recruitment.\"\n\n          If more were needed — and it plainly is not — the\n\npetitioner's claim for withholding of removal is deficient in\n\nanother respect: he has failed to tie mistreatment at the hands of\n\nthe gang to the Guatemalan government.   He makes no assertion that\n\nthe government is directly responsible for the activities of the\n\ngang.   Thus, he must show governmental acquiescence: that the\n\ngovernment is either unwilling or unable to control the gang's\n\nmisconduct.   See Jorgji v. Mukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1386154\"><a href=\"/opinion/1386154/jorgji-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57 (1st Cir.\n\n2008); Orelien v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 72 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f            The   only    evidence    bearing    on   this   point   is   the\n\npetitioner's testimony that when he notified the police of his\n\nconfrontation with the gang, their response was stymied by a\n\nprofessed lack of evidence.          Building on this porous foundation,\n\nthe petitioner urges us to conclude that the police acquiesced in\n\nthe gang's conduct.\n\n            We resist that exhortation.         The vignette relied on by\n\nthe petitioner does not compel the conclusion that the government\n\nwas either unable or unwilling to control the gang.          It is at least\n\nas plausible to infer that the police were ready, willing, and able\n\nto follow up, but could not do so with the scanty information that\n\nthe petitioner was able to provide.         A reasonable factfinder would\n\nnot be compelled to conclude that the police condoned the gang's\n\nmischief.    The BIA's contrary conclusion is, therefore, supported\n\nby substantial evidence.        See Morgan v. Holder, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204625\"><a href=\"/opinion/204625/morgan-v-holder/\"><span class=\"volume\">634</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">53</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 59\n\n(1st Cir. 2011).\n\n            This brings us to the petitioner's second assignment of\n\nerror: the rejection of his CAT claim.          To prevail on such a claim,\n\nan alien must show that, more likely than not, he will be tortured\n\nupon repatriation.       8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2); Romilus v. Ashcroft,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201241\"><a href=\"/opinion/201241/romilus-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (1st Cir. 2004).        For CAT purposes, \"torture\" is any\n\nact that inflicts severe physical or mental pain, \"when such pain\n\nor suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the\n\nconsent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fin an official capacity.\"              8 C.F.R. § 1208.18(a); see Chhay v.\n\nMukasey, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203441\"><a href=\"/opinion/203441/chhay-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir. 2008).                Consequently, the alien\n\nmust show not only that the feared harm would amount to torture but\n\nalso       that    it   would   have   a   legally   sufficient   nexus   to   the\n\ngovernment.\n\n                  We need not probe these points.          In this case, the\n\npetitioner has made no meaningful effort to satisfy the applicable\n\nstandard.          While his brief makes a conclusory reference to the\n\ninsupportability of the BIA's ruling denying him CAT protection, it\n\nis devoid of any developed argumentation regarding this claim.\n\nGiven this failing, we deem the claim abandoned.4                   See Pan v.\n\nGonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202784\"><a href=\"/opinion/202784/pan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 87 (1st Cir. 2007); Jiang v.
