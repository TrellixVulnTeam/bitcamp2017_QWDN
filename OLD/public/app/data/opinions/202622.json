Daniel R.

David Rodriguez-Pacheco appeals\n\nfrom his sentence of thirty months' imprisonment and three years of\n\nsupervised release following his guilty plea to the crime of\n\npossession of child pornography.                 See 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(4)(B);\n\nsee generally Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996 (CPPA), 18\n\nU.S.C.   §    2251    et    seq.      Utilizing          the   advisory      sentencing\n\nguidelines,     the    district       court       held    that     Rodriguez-Pacheco\n\npossessed at least ten images of child pornography on the hard\n\ndrive of his computer.              That finding resulted in a two-level\n\nincrease to defendant's sentencing guideline range.                      See U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2G2.4(b)(2) (2002).           Consideration of the guidelines was an\n\nappropriate first step in the court's sentencing determination.\n\nUnited States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518-19 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (en banc).\n\n             Rodriguez-Pacheco        presents       a    single    legal     issue   on\n\nappeal: whether the prosecution must, in the absence of direct\n\nevidence,    produce       expert    opinion      testimony      that    a   particular\n\npornographic image is of a real, non-virtual child, in order to\n\nmeet   its   burden    of    proof    by    a    preponderance      of    evidence    at\n\nsentencing.     Defendant argues that as a matter of law the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. 234\n\n(2002), requires the government to produce such expert opinion\n\ntestimony, even in the absence of direct testimony provided by\n\ndefendant, to meet the burden of proof of guilt beyond a reasonable\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fdoubt, and so also the lesser burden of proof by a preponderance of\n\nevidence at sentencing.1       He argues for a per se rule of reversal\n\nin the absence of such expert opinion testimony as to meet its\n\nburden to each of ten images.\n\n             We hold that the premise of the argument is wrong:             Free\n\nSpeech     Coalition    does   not   impose   any     requirement    that   the\n\ngovernment produce such expert opinion testimony or be deemed to\n\nhave failed to establish proof by a preponderance of evidence.\n\nThis is the view of every circuit that has addressed the question.\n\n             Further, Free Speech Coalition does not overrule this\n\ncourt's decision in United States v. Nolan, 818 F.2d 1015 (1st Cir.\n\n1987),     holding   that   such   expert   opinion    testimony    --   that   a\n\nphotographic image is of a real child -- is not required to meet\n\nthe government's burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nId. at 1018-20.        No other circumstance leaves this panel free to\n\noverrule Nolan.        We reject, as we have before, such a per se\n\napproach that expert opinion testimony on this issue is a sine qua\n\nnon.       Reviewing the totality of the evidence, we affirm the\n\nsentence.\n\n\n\n\n       1\n          On appeal, defendant does not dispute the court's finding\nthat one of the images is of a prepubescent minor or a child under\nthe age of twelve. Nor is there any dispute that the images meet\nthe definition of sexually explicit conduct.\n\n                                      -3-\n\f                                           I.\n\n             Defendant was charged on September 1, 2004 under a\n\nSuperseding Indictment which alleged that he knowingly possessed\n\none or more items that contained a visual depiction of an actual\n\nperson under the age of eighteen engaged in sexually explicit\n\nconduct, and that the items were shipped in interstate or foreign\n\ncommerce     by    means   of    a    computer,    in    violation     of    18   U.S.C.\n\n§    2252(a)(4)(B).        The       Superseding     Indictment       also   made      the\n\nsentencing allegation that Rodriguez-Pacheco knowingly possessed at\n\nleast ten such images.\n\n             On September 27, 2004, while the jury was being selected,\n\ndefendant entered a straight plea of guilty to the requisite\n\nknowing possession of at least one such image which traveled in\n\ninterstate commerce.         He did not agree, however, that he possessed\n\nat   least   ten    images      of   minors     engaging     in   sexually    explicit\n\nconduct, which would enhance his guidelines sentencing range under\n\nU.S.S.G. § 2G2.4(b)(2) (2002).                  The court accepted defendant's\n\nguilty plea and stated that it would address the enhancement issue\n\nat sentencing. Defendant waived jury determination of the disputed\n\nsentencing enhancements. At that time, the government indicated it\n\nhad expert reports to support its position on guilt and sentencing.\n\nThe government had prepared its case under what was then this\n\ncircuit's     rule,     short-lived        and     later     withdrawn,      that      the\n\ngovernment    was     obligated       to   produce      an   expert   opinion     as    to\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\freality, even in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, in\n\norder to meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nUnited States v. Hilton (Hilton I), 363 F.3d 58, 65-66 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).\n\n            The court held further hearings on September 29, 2004,2\n\nand on several days in April 2005. The government offered evidence\n\non a sample of the 234 pornographic images taken from defendant's\n\ncomputer.     The government presented a pediatrician, Dr. Pedro\n\nJaunarena-Perez, who testified using the Tanner scale that ten of\n\nthe images obtained from defendant's computer were of children\n\nunder age eighteen.\n\n            The government also presented expert testimony on the\n\nissue of whether the images were of real, non-virtual people.   The\n\ncourt accepted Dr. Richard Vorder Bruegge of the FBI as an expert;\n\nhe testified both as to the methodology to be used in looking at\n\nimages to determine whether the image was of a real person and to\n\nhis conclusions that Exhibits 5 through 15 and Exhibit 17 contained\n\nimages of real people.   The parties agree that the prosecution did\n\nnot ask Dr. Vorder Bruegge his opinion as to whether Exhibit 16 was\n\n\n     2\n          The withdrawal of the Hilton I rule occurred on September\n27, 2004, the same day as defendant's change of plea hearing.\nThere is no indication that the court or the parties were aware\nthat the Hilton I rule had been withdrawn at any time during the\nchange of plea hearing or the sentencing evidentiary hearing on\nSeptember 29, 2004. The panel majority opinion was withdrawn and\nreplaced by a per curiam opinion, United States v. Hilton (Hilton\nII), 386 F.3d 13 (1st Cir. 2004), which did not contain a rule\nrequiring expert testimony. Id. at 18-19.\n\n                                 -5-\n\fof an actual person.          There is no suggestion the expert did not\n\nhave an opinion; he simply was not asked for it.3\n\n            When the sentencing hearing resumed on April 26, 2005,\n\ndefendant, relying on Free Speech Coalition, argued that as a\n\nmatter of law the prosecution was required to provide expert\n\nopinion testimony that each of the ten images was of an actual\n\nchild, and that the prosecution had failed to do so as to Exhibit\n\n16 because Dr. Vorder Bruegge did not testify as to whether the\n\ndepicted child was real or not.            The district court rejected the\n\nargument that Free Speech Coalition imposed any such requirement.\n\nIt did hold that Nolan had not been overruled and was binding\n\nprecedent.\n\n            The district court later found that Exhibit 16 was of a\n\nreal child which satisfied the ten-image requirement of U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2G2.4(b)(2) (2002). The court explained that it was competent to\n\nmake factual findings as to whether the child in Exhibit 16 was\n\nreal in light of the evidence of record before it.              The district\n\ncourt    found   that   the   image   in   Exhibit   16   portrayed   sexually\n\nexplicit conduct and was of an actual child.          The court imposed the\n\n\n     3\n          The government made clear that it would present Dr.\nVorder Bruegge as an expert on whether a series of particular\nexhibits, including Exhibit 16, were of real children, and that the\nexpert had examined each image. The direct examination did not\nentirely go image by image. For example, the prosecution jumped\nfrom Exhibits 7 and 8 to Exhibits 21 and 22, and then to Exhibit\n24. Frequent jumps were made to connect later numbered exhibits to\nearlier ones. This happened with Exhibit 15. The prosecution then\nsimply went on to ask Dr. Vorder Bruegge about Exhibit 17.\n\n                                      -6-\n\ftwo-level guidelines increase, based on its own review of the\n\nimage, the expert testimony of Dr. Jaunarena-Perez that the image\n\nwas of a minor, and its use of Dr. Vorder Bruegge's testimony as to\n\nthe methodology for distinguishing between real and virtual images;\n\nthe court also noted the absence of any testimony that the images\n\nwere not of actual children, to counter this evidence.\n\n           The    district      court,    under    the     post-Booker      advisory\n\nguidelines      system,   543    U.S.    220     (2005),      took   into   account\n\nmitigating factors and sentenced Rodriguez-Pacheco to thirty months\n\nof imprisonment and three years of supervised release.\n\n                                        II.\n\nA.         Effect of Free Speech Coalition\n\n           Our standard of review for legal questions, including\n\nthose about the effect of Free Speech Coalition, is de novo.\n\nUnited States v. Dunning, 312 F.3d 528, 531 (1st Cir. 2002).                      The\n\nquestion of whether or not a particular image is of a virtual child\n\nor of a real child is an issue of fact, to be determined by the\n\ntrier of fact.     United States v. Farrelly, 389 F.3d 649, 654 (6th\n\nCir.   2004),    abrogated      on   other     grounds   by    United    States    v.\n\nWilliams, 411 F.3d 675, 678 n.1 (6th Cir. 2005).                 The standard of\n\nreview for determinations of fact under the sentencing guidelines\n\nis for clear error. United States v. Rosario-Peralta 199 F.3d 552,\n\n568 (1st Cir. 1999).      We give due deference to the district court's\n\n\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\ffindings of fact under the guidelines.                United States v. Duclos,\n\n214 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            The prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that\n\nthe image is of an actual child in order to establish guilt.\n\nUnited States v. Syphers, 426 F.3d 461, 465 (1st Cir. 2005); United\n\nStates v. Hilton (Hilton II), 386 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\naccord United States v. Sims, 428 F.3d 945, 957 (10th Cir. 2005).\n\nThe    government    bears   the     burden,     by   a    preponderance    of   the\n\nevidence, to make the showing that the child is a real child for\n\nsentencing purposes. See U.S.S.G. § 6A1.3 (2002) (commentary); see\n\nalso United States v. Zuleta-Alvarez, 922 F.2d 33, 37 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).\n\n            Under Nolan, this circuit rejected a per se rule that the\n\ngovernment must produce expert testimony in addition to the images\n\nthemselves, in order to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\nimages depicted were of real children. Nolan, 818 F.2d at 1018-20.\n\nNolan involved magazine photographs which the court found to be of\n\nreal    children    in    light,    inter   alia,     of    the   clarity   of   the\n\nphotographs and the fact that the same child was in several\n\nphotographs in a variety of poses.             Id. at 1018.       The defendant in\n\nNolan    argued    that   \"the     prosecution    failed     to   prove   that   the\n\npictures were not composite representations or otherwise faked or\n\ndoctored, or . . . computer-generated\" or even \"fabricated using\n\nphotographs of nude children taken from legitimate sources.\"                     Id.\n\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fat 1016.    Nolan held that the mere possibility, unsupported by\n\nevidence, that the images could have been produced by use of\n\ntechnology and not using real children was not sufficient to reject\n\na lower court's ruling founded on reasonable inferences derived\n\nfrom experience and common sense.\n\n            We agree with the district court that Nolan has not been\n\noverruled   by     Free   Speech    Coalition.      To   start,    Free   Speech\n\nCoalition did not arise from a criminal prosecution.               Rather, the\n\ncase was a civil suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief; it\n\nconcerned a First Amendment facial overbreadth attack on certain\n\nprovisions of the CPPA.            535 U.S. at 243-44.        The Court held\n\noverbroad    and    unconstitutional        the   provision   of    18    U.S.C.\n\n§ 2256(8)(B),4 which stated:\n\n            (8) \"child pornography\" means any visual\n            depiction, including any photograph, film,\n            video, picture, or computer or computer-\n            generated image or picture, whether made or\n            produced by electronic, mechanical, or other\n            means, of sexually explicit conduct, where --\n            . . .\n                   (B) such visual depiction is, or\n                   appears to be, of a minor engaging in\n                   sexually explicit conduct.\n\nFree Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 241, 256 (emphasis added).               The\n\nFirst Amendment overbreadth issue arose from the \"or appears to be\"\n\nlanguage of that section, by which Congress sought to punish\n\n     4\n          The   Court  also   held  unconstitutional   18  U.S.C.\n§ 2256(8)(D), which extended the prohibition of child pornography\nto any sexually explicit image that \"conveys the impression\" that\nit depicts \"a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" Free\nSpeech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 242, 258.\n\n                                      -9-\n\fpossession of virtual images, which did not involve real children.\n\nId. at 241.\n\n          Earlier, in New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982), the\n\nSupreme Court had upheld against First Amendment attack a state\n\nchild pornography statute which did not purport to prohibit virtual\n\nimages, but only images of real children.   Id. at 765, 773-74.   The\n\nCourt in Ferber upheld the state statute against First Amendment\n\nattack, even though the statute prohibited material that would not\n\nbe obscene,5 because the production of child pornography utilizing\n\nreal children necessarily harmed the children.   Id. at 759-60; id.\n\nat 758 & n.9 (noting the legislative judgment that \"the use of\n\nchildren as subjects of pornographic materials is harmful to the\n\nphysiological, emotional, and mental health of the child[ren]\");\n\nsee also United States v. Frabizio, 459 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(discussing the harm done to children through the production of\n\nchild pornography).\n\n          In Free Speech Coalition, by contrast, the production of\n\nvirtual images (the possession of which was prohibited by the CPPA)\n\ndid not directly harm real children.   535 U.S. at 236 (\"[T]he CPPA\n\nprohibits speech that records no crime and creates no victims by\n\nits production. Virtual child pornography is not 'intrinsically\n\n\n     5\n          Under Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973), the test\nfor obscenity is whether the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the\nprurient interest, is patently offensive in light of community\nstandards, and lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or\nscientific value. Id. at 24.\n\n                               -10-\n\frelated' to the sexual abuse of children.\"      (quoting Ferber, 458\n\nU.S. at 759)).     As a result, Free Speech Coalition held that 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2256(8)(B) was overbroad because of the \"or appears to be\"\n\nclause.   Id. at 256.\n\n           The Court in Free Speech Coalition did not rule on the\n\nnature of the proof the government must produce to demonstrate that\n\nan image of a child was of a real child.      That argument was not\n\nbefore the Court, which had before it only the issue of the facial\n\nconstitutionality of the statute.      There was also no issue as to\n\nwhether the statute had been unconstitutionally applied to an image\n\nwhich the government had failed to prove was of a real child.\n\n           The remaining provisions of the CPPA, not struck, remain\n\nintact. The unconstitutional provisions of the Act, which expanded\n\nthe prohibition against child pornography to encompass materials\n\nthat did not involve the use of real children, are severable from\n\nthe CPPA, and did not affect the constitutional viability of\n\nprovisions regulating possession of traditional child pornography.\n\nSee United States v. Kimler, 335 F.3d 1132, 1141 (10th Cir.), cert.\n\ndenied, 540 U.S. 1083 (2003); United States v. Kelly, 314 F.3d 908,\n\n911 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 538 U.S. 1001 (2003); United States\n\nv. Hall, 312 F.3d 1250, 1259 (11th Cir. 2002), cert. denied, 538\n\nU.S. 954 (2003).   Since the Supreme Court did not address the issue\n\nbefore us, and since the statute as excised survives, our pre-CPPA\n\ncase law, including Nolan, survives as well.\n\n\n\n                                -11-\n\f            Our reading of the effect of Free Speech Coalition agrees\n\nwith that of every circuit that has addressed the question.           For\n\nexample, in United States v. Irving, 452 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 2006),\n\nthe court upheld a jury verdict convicting defendant of possession\n\nof child pornography based on videos where the government offered\n\nno proof beyond the videos themselves that the images were of real\n\nchildren.    Id. at 122.   Rejecting the argument that Free        Speech\n\nCoalition necessarily created a bright-line rule, the court noted:\n\n            Although the Supreme Court noted the possible\n            evidentiary   difficulty   of   distinguishing\n            virtual and actual child pornography, it did\n            not establish a bright-line rule requiring\n            that the government proffer a specific type of\n            proof to show the use of an actual child.\n\nId. at 121 (citing Free Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 254-56).\n\nFree Speech Coalition does not lay down \"the absolute requirement\n\nthat, absent direct evidence of identity, expert testimony is\n\nrequired to prove that the prohibited images are of real, not\n\nvirtual, children.\"     Kimler, 335 F.3d at 1142; see also Farrelly,\n\n389 F.3d at 653-54; United States v. Slanina, 359 F.3d 356, 357\n\n(5th Cir. 2004) (per curiam); United States v. Deaton, 328 F.3d\n\n454, 455 (8th Cir. 2003) (per curiam).      The same cases universally\n\naccept the proposition that juries are capable of distinguishing\n\nbetween   real   and   virtual   images,   without   expert   assistance.\n\nIrving, 452 F.3d at 122 (video images); Farrelly, 389 F.3d at 654;\n\nSlanina, 359 F.3d at 357; Kimler, 335 F.3d at 1142; Deaton, 328\n\nF.3d at 455.      In a number of cases evaluating the effect of\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\ferroneous jury instructions, the appellate courts have examined\n\nimages themselves and, on that basis, determined that those images\n\nwere of real children.        See Becht v. United States, 403 F.3d 541,\n\n549 (8th Cir. 2005); Hall, 312 F.3d at 1260; United States v.\n\nRichardson, 304 F.3d 1061, 1064 & n.2 (11th Cir. 2002).\n\nB.         Vitality of Nolan\n\n           This    leaves   the   defendant's         alternate   argument      that\n\ntechnology   has   progressed     so    far    that     we   should   abandon    the\n\napproach that there is no per se rule that the government must\n\nprovide an expert opinion that an image is of a real child.                       We\n\nunderstand the dissent to join this argument, but not to argue that\n\nFree Speech Coalition itself overrules Nolan.\n\n           A panel of this court is normally bound to follow an\n\nearlier   panel    decision    that    is     closely    on   point,    unless   an\n\nexception exists to the principles of stare decisis.                   Williams v.\n\nAshland Eng'g Co., 45 F.3d 588, 592 (1st Cir. 1995) (subsequent\n\ncase history omitted).        As a leading commentator has stated:\n\n           The doctrine of stare decisis provides that\n           courts must abide by or adhere to cases that\n           have been previously decided and that a legal\n           decision on an issue of law that is contained\n           in a final judgment is binding in all future\n           cases on the court that made the legal\n           decision and all other courts that owe\n           obedience to that court. In other words, the\n           doctrine of stare decisis incorporates two\n           principles: (1) a court is bound by its own\n           prior legal decisions unless there are\n           substantial reasons to abandon a decision; and\n           (2) a legal decision rendered by a court will\n\n\n\n                                       -13-\n\f          be followed by all courts inferior to it in\n          the judicial system.\n\n3 J. Moore et al., Moore's Manual -- Federal Practice and Procedure\n\n§ 30.10[1] (2006) (footnotes omitted).\n\n          In this circuit, we have recognized two exceptions to\n\nthis stare decisis rule.6   The first exception applies when \"[a]n\n\nexisting panel decision [is] undermined by controlling authority,\n\nsubsequently announced, such as an opinion of the Supreme Court, an\n\nen banc opinion of the circuit court, or a statutory overruling.\"\n\nWilliams, 45 F.3d at 592.   This exception does not apply here, as\n\nthere is no Supreme Court opinion, en banc opinion of this circuit,\n\nor statute that overrules Nolan.\n\n          We have also recognized a second, limited exception that\n\npermits one panel to overrule another in \"those relatively rare\n\ninstances in which authority that postdates the original decision,\n\nalthough not directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound\n\nreason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh\n\ndevelopments, would change its collective mind.\"   Id.   The second\n\nexception likewise does not apply to this case. The dissent argues\n\nthat we should overrule Nolan under this second exception in part\n\n     6\n          Williams cited generally to Colby v. J.C. Penney Co., 811\nF.2d 1119 (7th Cir. 1987), which concerned the misapplication by a\ndistrict court of stare decisis principles. Colby discussed the\ndifferences between deference due to authoritative versus\npersuasive decisions and the wisdom of one circuit court\nconsidering the views of other circuit courts in order to maintain\nuniformity in federal law. Id. at 1123. Here, of course, every\ncircuit court to consider the issue has rejected defendant's\nproposed rule.\n\n                               -14-\n\fbecause    of   technological   developments.      But   the   \"fresh\n\ndevelopments\" considered in Williams were not technological changes\n\nbut rather fresh developments in the law in the form of the views\n\nof another circuit court. Id.; see also Carpenters Local Union No.\n\n26 v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 215 F.3d 136, 145 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            We made clear the limits of the second Williams exception\n\nin Eulitt v. Maine, 386 F.3d 344 (1st Cir. 2004), stating that \"[a]\n\nsecond exception exists when recent Supreme Court precedent calls\n\ninto legitimate question a prior opinion of an inferior court.\"\n\nId. at 350 (emphasis added) (citing Carpenters Local, 215 F.3d at\n\n141 (overruling circuit precedent in light of two Supreme Court\n\ncases); Crowe v. Bolduc, 365 F.3d 86, 89, 92 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(overruling circuit precedent in light of a Supreme Court case)).\n\nFurther, in United States v. Guzmán, 419 F.3d 27 (1st Cir. 2005),\n\nthe court described the second Williams exception as applying in\n\n\"instances that fairly may be described as hen's-teeth rare.\"    Id.\n\nat 31.\n\n            The Nolan rule is that the issue on appeal of whether a\n\npornographic image is of a real child is to be treated as a\n\nsufficiency of the evidence question, evaluating the evidence as a\n\nwhole.    There is no reason, much less a compelling reason based on\n\nnew facts, to abandon that rule,7 even assuming that new fact\n\n     7\n          The dissent attempts to analogize to a drug identity case\nand claims that expert testimony or at least the opinion of a\nknowledgeable lay person is required to establish the illicit\nnature of a substance.    This is not accurate.    \"Proof based on\n\n                                 -15-\n\fdevelopments may lead to abandonment by one panel of a prior\n\ncircuit precedent. The Supreme Court has recognized in itself (but\n\nnot necessarily in the circuit courts) the power to depart from\n\nstare decisis \"to bring its opinions into agreement with experience\n\nand with facts newly ascertained.\"           Vasquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S.\n\n254, 266 (1986) (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U.S.\n\n393, 412 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).       The present rule, rather than an inflexible rule\n\nrequiring that expert evidence must be provided by the prosecution,\n\nreflects    a   far   better   method   to   accommodate    developments   in\n\ntechnology.      No occasion is presented here to depart from the\n\nprinciples of stare decisis based on technological developments.\n\n            Defendant and the dissent also rely on language in Free\n\nSpeech Coalition indicating that Congress was concerned that new\n\ntechnology made it possible to produce realistic virtual images\n\nand,   as   technology     improved,     experts   may     have   difficulty\n\ndistinguishing virtual images from real images.            But defendant and\n\nthe dissent insufficiently appreciate language in Free Speech\n\nCoalition that refers to the continuing use of real children:\n\n\nscientific analysis or expert testimony is not required to prove\nthe illicit nature of a substance, and identification of a\nsubstance as a drug may be based on the opinion of a knowledgeable\nlay person.\" United States v. Walters, 904 F.2d 765, 770 (1st Cir.\n1990) (emphasis added).    In Walters, we also said that \"[a]s a\ngeneral matter, '[i]dentification of a controlled substance does\nnot require direct evidence if available circumstantial evidence\nestablishes its identity beyond a reasonable doubt.'\" Id. (second\nalteration in original) (quoting United States v. Harrell, 737 F.2d\n971, 978 (11th Cir. 1984)).\n\n                                    -16-\n\f          If virtual images were identical to illegal\n          child pornography, the illegal images would be\n          driven    from     the     market     by    the\n          indistinguishable      substitutes.         Few\n          pornographers   would   risk   prosecution   by\n          abusing    real    children    if    fictional,\n          computerized images would suffice.\n\nFree Speech Coalition, 535 U.S. at 254.\n\n          Whatever   improvements     may   eventually   be   made   in\n\ntechnology,8 the Supreme Court's observation about the market for\n\nchild pornography is still correct.     There is no basis to assume\n\nthat the producers of child pornography have widely converted to\n\n\n     8\n          The dissent cites several articles on the state of\ntechnology.     At most, the articles describe the kinds of\nphotographic    alterations  that   are   possible    with   recent\ntechnological advances, but they do not say that images of real and\nvirtual people are indistinguishable. See M. Aspan, Media; Ease of\nAlteration Creates Woes for Picture Editors, N.Y. Times, Aug. 14,\n2006, at C4 (noting only that photographic alterations of real\nimages may be difficult to detect); H. Farid, Digital Doctoring:\nHow to Tell the Real from the Fake, 3 Significance 162, 162-66\n(2006),     available    at    http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/\npublications/significance06.pdf (describing the possibility of\ncreating composite photographs using existing images of real\npeople, but not commenting on the creation of realistic images of\nvirtual people); C. Johnston, Digital Deception, Am. Journalism\nRev., May 1, 2003, at 10 (discussing composite images of real\npeople, not images of virtual people); S.L. Leach, Seeing Is No\nLonger Believing, Christian Sci. Monitor, Feb. 2, 2005, at 15\n(describing methods of photographic manipulation, but not\nsuggesting that current technology allows creation of virtual\npeople that are indistinguishable from real people). The dissent\nalso cites a law review note for the proposition that \"[t]here is\nwide agreement that an ordinary person cannot generally tell a\nreal image from a virtual one.\" T.J. Perla, Note, Attempting to\nEnd the Cycle of Virtual Pornography Prohibitions, 83 B.U. L. Rev.\n1209, 1220 (2003). However, the note provides no support for this\nclaim beyond a reference to a commercial brochure advertising\nvirtual image rendering hardware. Id. at 1220 n.60. The brochure\nmakes no claims as to the ability of a non-expert to distinguish\nbetween real and virtual images of people.\n\n                               -17-\n\fexclusive use of virtual pornography.                 Even before Free Speech\n\nCoalition, Nolan made the point that, given the proliferation and\n\nsheer number of the pornographic images available, common sense\n\nstrongly suggests that many of the images on the market are of real\n\nchildren.    818 F.2d at 1018.\n\n            Nor is there any reason to think that the exploitation of\n\nreal children to produce pornography has ceased.                   We know as a\n\nmatter of fact that the market continues using real children to\n\nproduce pornography because the cases, including this one, continue\n\nto have in them direct evidence that a real child was used.                    See,\n\ne.g., Frabizio, 459 F.3d at 82 & n.3; United States v. Smith, 459\n\nF.3d 1276, 1287 (11th Cir. 2006); United States v. Mack, 452 F.3d\n\n744, 745 (8th Cir. 2006).          In this case, multiple images taken from\n\ndefendant's computer were identified as depicting real children,\n\nafter    comparing       the   images   to   those    compiled     in    the   Child\n\nExploitation       and    Obscenity     Reference     File   and   the    database\n\nmaintained    by    the    FBI's   Child     Victim   Identification      Program.\n\nDefendant himself admitted that one of the images was of a real\n\nchild.\n\n            Nor is there any reason to assume that particular images\n\non which a prosecution is based have been produced by such superior\n\ntechnology.    In this case, for example, certain of the images had\n\nbeen published in magazines from the 1970s or 1980s, well before\n\nthere was the capacity to do any realistic form of virtual imaging.\n\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\f           The burden of proof remains on the government to prove\n\nthe pornographic image is of a real child.       The overarching legal\n\npoint is the holding stated in Nolan: \"[T]he prosecution was not\n\nrequired, as part of its affirmative case, to rule out every\n\nconceivable way the pictures could have been made other than by\n\nordinary photography.\" 818 F.2d at 1020; see also United States v.\n\nSmith, 680 F.2d 255, 259 (1st Cir. 1982) (\"The Government . . .\n\nneed not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, provided\n\nthe record as a whole supports a conclusion of guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"); 26 J. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice\n\n§ 629.05[2] (3d ed. 2006) (\"Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does\n\nnot require that the government adduce evidence excluding all\n\nreasonable defense theories, thereby leaving only the conclusion of\n\nguilt independently proved.\").\n\n           We should not be misunderstood: the government at all\n\ntimes has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence at\n\nsentencing, and the defendant has no burden.           There is nothing\n\ninconsistent   between   the   government's   having   that   burden   and\n\nNolan's statement that the defendant, while under no obligation to\n\ndo so, was \"free to have presented evidence of his own suggesting\n\nthat the picture[] used other than real subjects.         He could have\n\ncalled an expert to testify as to how photographs like [this one]\n\ncould have been made without using real children.\" Nolan, 818 F.2d\n\nat 1020.   If defendant had chosen to mount a defense of this type\n\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fand presented such expert testimony, and had the government not\n\ncalled an expert to explain why the image was not real, the\n\ngovernment ran the risk of not persuading the trier of fact.     This\n\ndoes not shift the burden of proof.          The evaluation of the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence is done on the record as a whole, not\n\non \"bright line\" tests such as the one defendant advances.\n\nC.           Unpreserved Arguments Made By The Dissent\n\n             The dissent injects new arguments into the case which\n\nwere not raised by Rodriguez-Pacheco in the district court or on\n\nappeal.   As such, the arguments have been waived.        See United\n\nStates v. Gobbi, 471 F.3d 302, 312 n.4 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n             The dissent first makes the novel argument that the\n\nproceedings below were unfair and so the defendant was sandbagged.\n\nDefendant never made this argument at any time.          If defendant\n\nthought there was procedural unfairness, he would have said so.\n\nThe dissent's procedural unfairness argument is without merit in\n\nany event.    The argument seems to be that defendant came to expect\n\nthere would be an expert opinion on each of the ten images, and his\n\ndisappointed expectations mean the case should be remanded.       The\n\nargument, which has other deficiencies, ignores the fact that when\n\nthe government prepared the case, the panel opinion in Hilton I\n\nrequired expert testimony, and so the case proceeded on that basis.\n\nBefore the expert gave his testimony, the law had changed, the rule\n\nin Hilton I had been withdrawn, and the defense was well aware of\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fthe change.      Defendant knew from the outset of the sentencing\n\nhearing that the government would present an expert on the reality\n\nof the images.       Yet he chose not to introduce his own expert, or\n\noffer any evidence of his own that the images were not of real\n\nchildren.   Further, the district court's reference to \"scientific,\n\ntechnical or other specialized skill\" to help it determine the\n\nreality of children depicted in the prosecution's exhibits came\n\nwhen it explained its reasons for admitting Dr. Vorder Bruegge as\n\nan expert witness, over defense counsel's objection.               That could\n\nnot have misled defendant.9\n\n            The dissent next makes the novel argument that it was\n\nerror for the district court not to sua sponte infer from the\n\ngovernment's failure to ask Dr. Vorder Bruegge for his opinion on\n\nExhibit 16, that he would have said, if asked, that the image was\n\nnot of a real child.             The defense did not ask for such an\n\ninference;10   its    argument    was    that,   whatever   the   government's\n\nreasons for not questioning the expert on Exhibit 16, only an\n\n\n\n\n     9\n          The dissent quotes the district court at the September\n29, 2004 hearing as stating, \"I can't make a finding unless I have\nan expert that this is a minor.\" The district court was obviously\nunaware at the time that this requirement, imposed by Hilton I, had\nbeen withdrawn by Hilton II on September 27, 2004.\n     10\n          It is clear from the prosecutor's statements at the\nhearing that she thought she had asked Dr. Vorder Bruegge's opinion\non Exhibit 16.     The prosecutor even accused the defense of\nmisstating the record. The court was then required to go back into\nthe record.\n\n                                        -21-\n\fexpert, not a court or even a jury as factfinder, could make that\n\ndetermination.\n\n          The dissent also gains no support from cases in which\n\nadverse inferences are requested and drawn, based on a party's\n\nfailure to produce a witness at all.       See, e.g., Olszewski v.\n\nSpencer, 466 F.3d 47, 61 (1st Cir. 2006).       Here, there was no\n\nfailure to produce a witness, only a failure to ask a particular\n\nquestion from a produced witness.      Further, no inference can be\n\ndrawn, contrary to the dissent, from the district court's failure\n\nto take over the examination of the witness when Exhibit 16 was not\n\nraised during questioning.\n\n          Finally, the dissent makes another argument which was not\n\nmade by defendant on appeal.     Defendant's argument on appeal is\n\nthat the law requires the government to produce the opinion of an\n\nexpert that an image is of a real child, and, since no such opinion\n\nwas offered, therefore the evidence was insufficient, regardless of\n\nthe other evidence.   We have rejected that legal proposition.   The\n\ndissent makes a different argument that the remaining evidence was\n\ninsufficient as a matter of evidence.      The dissent confuses the\n\nrole of the expert with the district court's role as factfinder.\n\nThat argument is also waived.     Nonetheless, we discuss why the\n\nargument fails.\n\n          The government met its burden of proof by a preponderance\n\nof the evidence.   The district court as finder of fact was entitled\n\n\n\n                                -22-\n\fto use Dr. Vorder Bruegge's testimony about criteria relevant to\n\ndetermining whether an image is real to assist it in making its own\n\ndetermination concerning Exhibit 16.     The expert testified that\n\ncomputer-generated   images     have   difficulty   recreating   the\n\ncharacteristics of human eyes and skin.       He also stressed the\n\nimportance of evaluating how individuals in an image interact with\n\none another and their environment -- factors to consider included\n\nshadows, gravity, and the effect of pressure on a human body.    The\n\nexpert also evaluated flesh and muscle tone on human images.     The\n\ndistrict court judge adopted Dr. Vorder Bruegge's methodology,\n\nmaking clear that his conclusion as to the reality of the child in\n\nExhibit 16 was \"[b]ased on the testimony that [the expert] provided\n\nas to all of the other photographs [and] the criteria that he was\n\nusing.\"   Further, the judge \"conclude[d] that the skin, that the\n\ntonation of the muscles, that both hands on the thighs of the male\n\nimpress the Court that this is not a virtual image but it is a real\n\nimage.\"   The district court made these findings, applying Dr.\n\nVorder Bruegge's methodology.    That is sufficient.   The district\n\ncourt had sufficient evidence, and no evidence to the contrary,11\n\nto conclude that Exhibit 16 depicted a real child.\n\n\n     11\n          When the court commented on the failure of the defendant\nto produce an expert, and so it had to use its own judgment, it was\nin the context of the defendant's argument that a factfinder could\nnot, without particular expert testimony, have an opinion as to the\nreality of a depicted child.     The district court drew its own\nconclusion that the image was real, noting that it was given no\ntestimony that the image was not real.\n\n                                -23-\n\f          Having addressed the dissent's additional arguments, we\n\nnote that defendant himself does not otherwise challenge the\n\ncourt's finding that the tenth image is of a real child.\n\n          The sentence is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                  \"Dissenting opinion follows\"\n\n\n\n\n                              -24-\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Dissenting).                 Although the\n\nappellant was charged with a serious and opprobrious crime, as with\n\nany person accused under our system of justice, irrespective of the\n\nnature of the government's allegations against him, he is entitled\n\nto due process of law.         The government has failed to meet its\n\nburden of establishing by competent evidence a crucial element that\n\nmust   be   proven   before   the   district       court   can   apply   enhanced\n\nsentencing factors.      See Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition, 535\n\nU.S. 234, 256 (2002) (clarifying that the government may not\n\ncriminalize possession of non-obscene sexually explicit images that\n\nappear to be, but do not in fact, depict real children); United\n\nStates v. Hilton (Hilton II), 386 F.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(same).     Thus appellant has not received all the process that is\n\ndue to him. Because my colleagues in the majority have concluded\n\notherwise, I am compelled to respectfully dissent.\n\n            Succinctly    put,      for      the     sentencing     enhancement\n\nestablished in U.S.S.G. § 2G2.4(b)(2) (2002) to be validly applied\n\nby the district court in this case, the government had to establish\n\nthat Appellant David Rodríguez-Pacheco (\"Appellant\") possessed at\n\nleast ten proscribed images.        The government only properly proved\n\nthat   he    possessed    nine      images     of     actual,     real    minors.\n\nUnfortunately, after the close of the evidence, the district judge\n\nerroneously proceeded to provide the missing link by concluding,\n\nwithout adequate foundation in the evidence, that there was a tenth\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fimage of an actual person.         Because there was no such tenth image\n\nestablished     by   adequate     proof,       in    my   opinion,   we     have   no\n\nalternative but to disallow the resulting sentence, and to remand\n\nthe case for appropriate sentencing.\n\n           As    will     be    shown   hereinafter,        the   district     court\n\ncommitted three pivotal errors, related in nature, but distinct in\n\nfactual and legal significance.                Individually and collectively\n\nthese errors inevitably lead to the outcome I suggest.\n\n           First,    if    we    consider      the   district     court's   rulings\n\nthroughout most of the sentencing process, Appellant was led to\n\nbelieve that the government would need to prove the reality of the\n\npersons depicted for all of the images introduced to prove the\n\nsentencing enhancement.         The court's last minute change of course,\n\nwhereby it effectively relieved the government of its burden, was\n\nnot only a legally incorrect shifting of the burden that properly\n\nbelongs to the government, see Hilton II, 386 F.3d at 18, but it\n\nalso left Appellant high and dry at a point in the proceedings when\n\nit was most tactically disadvantageous.                    Second, although the\n\ngovernment presented competent evidence regarding the reality of\n\nnine of the ten images introduced into evidence for the purpose of\n\nenhancing Appellant's sentence, it failed to do so regarding the\n\ntenth image, notwithstanding its opportunity and legal burden to do\n\nso.   An inference was thus raised that the government was unable to\n\nprove this element as to that tenth image.                   This inference was\n\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\fnever overcome by competent evidence to the contrary, and thus the\n\nbasis for the attempted sentencing enhancement fails. Third, given\n\nthe state of scientific, technical, and specialized knowledge\n\nextant today in the digital reproduction of photographic images,\n\nthe district judge was independently unqualified to reach a valid\n\nconclusion regarding whether the tenth image represented a real\n\nperson.     Because     there   was   no   proper   evidentiary   foundation\n\npresented as to the tenth image, the district court could not\n\nindependently find a crucial fact, i.e., that the image was of a\n\nreal person.      Thus, the government failed to meet its burden in\n\nthis    respect   and   the   district     court   erroneously   applied   the\n\nsentencing enhancement.\n\n                        I. The Initial Proceedings\n\n            A Superseding Indictment charged Appellant with a single\n\ncount of possessing prohibited visual depictions in violation of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2252(a)(4)(B).         In its relevant portions, this statute\n\nprohibits the knowing possession of matter which contains any\n\nvisual depiction if \"(i) the producing of such visual depiction\n\ninvolves the use of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct;\n\nand (ii) such visual depiction is of such conduct.\"12             The statute\n\n\n       12\n        18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(4)(B) states in full:\n       (a) Any person who–-\n            (4) either–-\n                 (B) knowingly possesses 1 or more books,\n            magazines, periodicals, films, video tapes, or\n            other matter which contain any visual depiction\n            that has been mailed, or has been shipped or\n\n                                      -27-\n\fdefines \"minor\" as \"any person under the age of eighteen years,\" 18\n\nU.S.C. § 2256(1), and \"sexually explicit conduct\" as conduct\n\nspecified in 18 U.S.C. § 2256(2)(A).13\n\n          Appellant pled guilty to the charged violation pursuant\n\nto a straight plea.   See Hr'g on Change of Plea Tr. 2, Sept. 27,\n\n2004.14 For purposes of that plea, Appellant admitted to possessing\n\n\"at least one photograph which traveled in interstate commerce by\n\nuse of a computer and [that] those depictions represent a minor\n\nengaging in sexually explicit conduct.\"   Id. at 28; see also id. at\n\n\n\n\n          transported in interstate or foreign commerce, or\n          which was produced using materials which have been\n          mailed or so shipped or transported, by any means\n          including by computer, if–-\n                    (i)   the  producing   of   such   visual\n               depiction involves the use of a minor engaging\n               in sexually explicit conduct; and\n                    (ii) such visual depiction is of such\n               conduct.\n     13\n      18 U.S.C. § 2256(2)(A) states in relevant part that:\n     \"sexually explicit conduct\" means actual or simulated–-\n               (i) sexual intercourse, including genital-\n          genital, oral-genital, anal-genital, or oral-anal,\n          whether between persons of the same or opposite\n          sex;\n               (ii) bestiality;\n               (iii) masturbation;\n               (iv) sadistic or masochistic abuse; or\n               (v) lascivious exhibition of the genitals or\n          pubic area of any person.\n     14\n      The date on the cover of the transcript reads \"27th day of\nFebruary, 2001.\" This is an obvious error as Appellant was not\nindicted until July 9, 2004. This is one of several errors found\nthroughout a confused and deficient transcript record.       The\ncorrected date of September 27, 2004 is corroborated by Docket\nEntry No. 51.\n\n                               -28-\n\f29, 37, 53, 74,15 76, 78-81. He contested \"[e]verything else.\" Id.\n\nat   37.    Specifically,   he   refused   to   accept   two   sentencing\n\nallegations charged in the indictment, id. at 22-23, 37-39, 48-49,\n\neach of which would result in a two-level increase under the\n\nsentencing guidelines: (1) that he knowingly possessed images of a\n\nprepubescent minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2G2.4(b)(1) (2002), and (2) that he knowingly possessed at least\n\nten images of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct, id.\n\n§ 2G2.4(b)(2).\n\n            The district court, after extensive interchanges with\n\nAppellant, his lawyer, and government counsel, accepted the plea as\n\nentered by Appellant and subject to the caveats expressed by\n\nAppellant and his lawyer.        Hr'g on Change of Plea Tr. 37, 81,\n\nSept. 27, 2004.    The court issued an order setting a hearing in\n\nwhich the government would be required to prove that \"a number of\n\nimages, more than ten, (for the enhancement to be potentially\n\napplicable), consist[] of real images, of minors of prepubescent\n\nage engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" Order 6, Feb. 8, 2005;\n\nsee also Evidentiary Hr'g Tr. 47, 54, 58, Sept. 29, 2004.         Relying\n\non these rulings, Appellant waived a jury trial on the enhancement\n\nissues.    See Hr'g on Change of Plea Tr. 50-54, Sept. 27, 2004.\n\n\n\n\n      15\n      Although included in the transcript dated September 27, 2004,\nthe testimony beginning on page 73 apparently took place on\nSeptember 29, 2004.\n\n                                  -29-\n\f          Appellant's explicit refusal to accept these two critical\n\nallegations put the government on notice early on that it would\n\nhave to establish by competent evidence (1) that the persons\n\ndepicted in the images engaging in sexually explicit conduct were\n\nless than eighteen years of age and prepubescent, and (2) that at\n\nleast ten of the depictions in Appellant's possession were of\n\nactual real persons engaging in such conduct.      See Free Speech\n\nCoalition, 535 U.S. at 244, 256; Hilton II, 386 F.3d at 19.\n\n          The   district   court   clearly   understood    \"competent\n\nevidence\" regarding the age of those depicted in the images to mean\n\nexpert testimony.    The district judge stated twice during the\n\ncourse of the proceedings, \"I can't make a finding unless I have an\n\nexpert that this is a minor.\"   Hr'g on Change of Plea Tr. 77, Sept.\n\n27, 2004; Evidentiary Hr'g Tr. 66, Sept. 29, 2004.        The court's\n\nunderstanding of \"competent evidence\" as to the second element, the\n\nactual reality of the persons depicted in the images, was equally\n\nclear:\n\n          The ruling of the Court, pursuant to Rule 702,\n          states,   scientific,   technical   or   other\n          specialized knowledge will assist the trier of\n          fact to understand evidence or determine a\n          fact in issue. And in this case there is a\n          fact in issue, and that is whether or not\n          these are authentic, real images or whether\n          they are virtual images.       So scientific,\n          technical or other specialized skill is\n          needed.\n\nSentencing Hr'g Tr. 18-19, Apr. 7, 2005 (emphasis added); see also\n\nHr'g on Change of Plea Tr. 44, Sept. 27, 2004 (\"[APPELLANT'S\n\n\n                                -30-\n\fCOUNSEL]: And they would have to bring an expert to testify as to\n\nthat.        THE COURT: Yes, they will.\").\n\n                These   are   the   premises   under   which   the   government\n\nproceeded to present its sentencing enhancement case, see, e.g.,\n\nEvidentiary Hr'g Tr. 53, Sept. 29, 2004 (\"[GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: The\n\nrequirement that exists is that we have to establish real children.\n\nThe Court has to enter specific findings.\"), and these are the\n\npremises relied upon by Appellant before the rug was pulled out\n\nfrom under him when it was too late to do anything about it, id. at\n\n54.16\n\n\n\n\n        16\n      Counsel for the defense, in what turned out to be a prophetic\ninterchange with the district judge, stated during the course of\nthe September 29, 2004 hearing:\n\n             [APPELLANT'S   COUNSEL]:   If   we're   having   the\n        sentencing hearing today does this preclude the\n        government coming in January and trying to present --\n        suppose they don't prove ten photographs does that\n        preclude the government from coming in January and trying\n        to prove ten photographs then?\n\n             THE COURT: No. I am holding the hearing as to the\n        enhancement today. That's it.\n\nEvidentiary Hr'g Tr. 60, Sept. 29, 2004. The import of this and\nsurrounding discussions was that the government would have to\nestablish by expert witnesses the relevant ages of the persons\ndepicted and that they were real persons, and that failure to do so\nwould mean the enhancements would not be applied.\n\n                                       -31-\n\f           II. The Government's Sentencing Enhancement Case\n\n             At the sentencing hearing, the government chose to meet\n\nits burden17 by calling two separate expert witnesses: (1) one\n\nexpert to establish that the images depicted persons within the\n\nparameters of the statutory definition of minors and that at least\n\none such depiction was of a child of prepubescent age, and (2) a\n\nsecond     expert   to   establish   that   the   depictions   were   of   real\n\nchildren.\n\nA.   Dr. Pedro Jaunarena Pérez -- The Government's Expert on Age\n     Determination\n\n             The government called Dr. Pedro Jaunarena Pérez (\"Dr.\n\nJaunarena\"), a pediatrician, to testify as to the ages of the\n\npersons depicted in Exhibits 6 through 8 and 10 through 16 -- ten\n\nimages in total.         The government established that Dr. Jaunarena\n\nearned his undergraduate and medical degrees at the University of\n\nPuerto Rico, and did his internship at the Albert Einstein Medical\n\nCenter in Philadelphia, thereafter completing his residency in\n\npediatrics at the university hospital in the Puerto Rico Medical\n\nCenter.     He has been a practicing pediatrician since 1962, and in\n\n\n\n      17\n      This was another area in which the district court showed\nconsiderable equivocation, allowing Appellant to proceed under the\nassumption that the government would have to prove the age and\nreality of the persons depicted in the images by proof beyond a\nreasonable doubt, see Hr'g on Change of Plea Tr. 54, Sept. 27,\n2004; Evidentiary Hr'g Tr. 59-60, Sept. 29, 2004; Sentencing Hr'g\nTr. 37, Apr. 13, 2005, rather than by a preponderance of the\nevidence as properly required, see United States v.

The medical criteria used by Dr. Jaunarena to reach his\n\nconclusions included sexual maturity scales, the best of which in\n\nhis opinion is the Tanner scale, a method of determining the\n\nmaturity      of   children,   adolescents,   and   adults,18   and    his   own\n\n       18\n      See      Hilton II, 386 F.3d at 15; see also David T.

Other relevant\n\nprofessional and scientific organizations to which Dr. Vorder\n\nBruegge belongs include the American Society for Photogrammetry and\n\nRemote Sensing, the International Society for Optical Engineering,\n\n\n\n                                     -37-\n\fthe Tau Beta Pi engineering honor society, and the Sigma Xi honor\n\nsociety of research scientists.           Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 7-8, Apr. 7,\n\n2005.\n\n             Based upon these qualifications, the court ruled that\n\nDr. Vorder Bruegge was qualified as an expert under Rule 702\n\nbecause his \"scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge\n\nwill    assist   the   [district    judge]      to   understand   evidence    or\n\ndetermine a fact at issue.\"           Id. at 18-19 (\"I find that this\n\ngentlemen has training and can use his past education.                    And by\n\nthat, I mean his doctorate.        Even in the field of his doctorate, he\n\nhas experience in that he has 10,000 photographs evaluated.                   He\n\nseems   to   have   skills,   and    he   has    acquired    knowledge.      So,\n\ntherefore, the Court will admit him as an expert.\").              The district\n\njudge decided that given the posture of the case and the court's\n\nprior rulings, \"there is a fact in issue, and that is whether or\n\nnot these are authentic, real images or whether they are virtual\n\nimages . . . [and thus] scientific, technical or other specialized\n\nskill is needed.\"      Id. at 19 (emphasis added).          It is important to\n\nnote that this ruling was made immediately after, and in the\n\ncontext of, Dr. Vorder Bruegge's testimony that he had taken a\n\ncourse given by Professor Ratner on the creation of computer-\n\ngenerated virtual persons.         See supra text accompanying note 10.\n\n             In authenticating an image, Dr. Vorder Bruegge testified,\n\nthere is a \"sort of triage system in place.\"             Sentencing Hr'g Tr.\n\n\n\n                                     -38-\n\f9, Apr. 7, 2005.    First, the expert determines if there are any\n\nknown victims, individuals who have previously been identified in\n\nimages, or if the image is from a known database, such as the Child\n\nExploitation and Obscenity Reference File (\"CEORF\"), which is a\n\ndatabase of images found in magazines that were published in the\n\n1970s and 1980s.    The CEORF was created by Dr. Vorder Bruegge's\n\nunit in the FBI.   The expert's identification of a known victim or\n\nimage serves the double purpose of identifying the victim and\n\ndetermining the approximate date when the image was created.            If\n\nthe image is of a person in the CEORF, it is possible to discount\n\nthe possibility that it is not of a real person, as such technology\n\ndid not become available until long after the time period covered\n\nby the CEORF.   Id. at 9, 28-29.    Two other important databases of\n\nknown victims are the FBI's Child Victim Identification Program and\n\nthe National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's related,\n\nbut separately maintained, database.       Id. at 28-30.\n\n          Once the available databases are checked, if the image is\n\nnot found therein, a scientific protocol has been established to\n\ndetermine whether the image is real, has been altered, or was\n\ncomputer-generated.     Dr.    Vorder    Bruegge   testified   in   detail\n\nregarding the methodology used in determining whether an image\n\ndepicts a real person.        The analysis comprises two parts: One\n\ninvolves determining whether the image depicts a real person, and\n\nthe other, whether the image has been manipulated.         Id. at 20.\n\n\n\n                                  -39-\n\f          The question of whether an image has been manipulated is\n\nanalyzed first.   This is done by visual inspection.      Computers\n\nenable Dr. Vorder Bruegge and others who do this work to inspect\n\nthe images in a highly magnified manner for signs of manipulation.\n\n\"For example, if a head is cut off one picture and superimposed on\n\nanother, there may be signs of that cutting and pasting operation\n\nand by analyzing the [magnified] image, it's possible to look for\n\ndefects that would indicate this type of manipulation.\"    Id.\n\n          In looking for signs of manipulation, there are a number\n\nof features that the expert checks. These include making sure that\n\nthe light in the scene is consistent; checking for differences in\n\ncolor within the scene;22 looking for consistency in the patterns\n\nin a scene, such as variations in the paneling of the walls in a\n\ncourtroom; checking for variations in the texture or grain of the\n\nimage -- which are detected when the image is magnified -- which\n\nwould demonstrate that two different types of film were used; and\n\ncomparing the focus, or depth of field, across an image.    Id. at\n\n20-22.\n\n          Second, to determine whether there is a real person\n\ndepicted in the image, the expert looks at the characteristics of\n\nthe people in question.   A computer-generated person created by a\n\nstate-of-the-art computer today does not have totally realistic\n\n     22\n      \"[S]kin tones are something that is very difficult to\nrecreate and match . . . and so one [needs to go] through the\nprocess of examining all parts of a body to look for variations.\"\nSentencing Hr'g Tr. 21, Apr. 7.\n\n                               -40-\n\fhuman features, as there are certain characteristics, such as the\n\neyes and skin, that are difficult to recreate from scratch with a\n\ncomputer.    Id. at 23.\n\n            The skin is a real problem because a great deal of detail\n\nis required to make it look real. Three dimensional animation only\n\ncreates a static model, and as the character is moved to another\n\nposition, to be realistic, it must be \"painted by hand . . . .\n\nEach picture, to be realistic, has to be hand altered.    There is a\n\nchecklist of skin features\" that the expert must consider in\n\ndetermining whether a person in an image is real or computer\n\ngenerated.    Id. at 24-25.\n\n            Another area that requires special attention in the\n\ndetermination of whether an image depicts a real person is that of\n\nthe attachment of the limbs to the torso.     With human beings, the\n\nattachment of the limbs to the torso occurs in a very supple way,\n\nwhich is very difficult to recreate on a computer.        The expert\n\ntherefore looks for \"crimps\" at the intersections where arms or\n\nlegs meet the body as evidence that an image is a 3-D recreation.\n\nId. at 25.\n\n            The expert also looks for \"defects like moles, freckles,\n\nscars, even the fine wrinkles in the mouth [and] ears.      Ears are\n\nsomething that computer artists have an incredibly hard time\n\ngetting right because they think that an ear is just something that\n\nyou slap on the side of the head, but an ear actually has a lot of\n\n\n\n                                 -41-\n\fdetail to it and it can move[;] . . . it can shift as you are\n\ntalking . . . .\"    Id. at 26.\n\n          How individuals in a picture interact with one another\n\nand their environment is also \"very critical in assessing the\n\nreality of the image.\"    Id.    This is reflected in a number of ways,\n\nincluding whether shadows realistically fall across the body of\n\nanother person depicted, such that it is \"[n]ot just a shadow\n\npainted on a two-dimensional object but the shadow has to conform\n\nto the three-dimensional nature of the person or the environment\n\nbehind it.\"   Id.   As another example, \"if you have a person sitting\n\non a couch or on a bed, the material underneath the person should\n\nreact in a realistic fashion to the presence of that person. . . .\n\nYou have to basically program gravity into it and that isn't\n\nsomething that is easy to do.\"       Id. at 26-27.\n\n          In sum, the expert methodology\n\n          consists of going through this checklist of\n          all the things that make an image appear to be\n          real and then make human beings appear to be\n          real, and determining if there is any\n          violation of those observations that would\n          indicate that there is something wrong with\n          the image and lead one to the conclusion that\n          this is not an accurate image of a real\n          person.\n\nId. at 27-28.\n\n          Dr. Vorder Bruegge further testified that if there are\n\nmultiple images of one person of \"sufficient quality, then based on\n\nthe fact that there are many images of the same person, the quality\n\n\n\n                                   -42-\n\fexceeds that possibility to create in an artificial manner, then we\n\nwill conclude that it is a real person.\"            Id. at 31.    However, \"if\n\nwe have only a single image, we do not . . . positively conclude\n\nthat that [sic] is a real person because the state-of-the-art of\n\nimage processing is such that someone . . . with a sufficient,\n\nsignificant amount of skill, time and willingness to spend the time\n\ncan create a perfect fake image -- it is possible that someone\n\ncould create one single fake image . . . .\"           Id. at 30-31 (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n           In addition to following an established methodology,\n\nDr. Vorder Bruegge's reports regarding authentication of images are\n\nsubject to peer review.        Every report that is written in Dr. Vorder\n\nBruegge's laboratory \"must be peer reviewed and a second qualified\n\nexaminer   must   sign   off    on   the    conclusions   and    report,\"   thus\n\nvalidating the reports by agreeing that the evidence supports the\n\nconclusions therein.      Id. at 33.\n\n           After obtaining testimony regarding standard methodology,\n\nthe government proceeded to elicit Dr. Vorder Bruegge's expert\n\nopinion regarding the images depicted in Government's Exhibits 5\n\nthrough 17, all of which he had examined on a prior occasion and\n\nwhich had been duly identified with his initials.\n\n           Dr. Vorder Bruegge testified that in his expert opinion\n\nExhibit 5 depicts a real child.            Id. at 38-39; Sentencing Hr'g Tr.\n\n7-8, Apr. 8, 2005.       He reached this conclusion based on the high\n\n\n\n                                      -43-\n\fdegree of detail in the picture, as well as the fact that there are\n\nother pictures of this individual.           Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 8, Apr. 8,\n\n2005.\n\n           As to Exhibits 6, 7, 8, and 9, Dr. Vorder Bruegge's\n\nopinion that the images depict real children was based in part on\n\nthe fact that the same individuals and scenes are depicted in\n\nmagazines known to have been published prior to April 1986.                   His\n\nconclusion also depended on his expert examination of the quality\n\nand level of detail in the images, and that there are multiple\n\npictures depicting the same individuals and scenes.                 Id. at 9-11,\n\n16-17.\n\n           Exhibit 10, which Appellant had already admitted as\n\nrepresenting an image of a real child as part of his change of plea\n\ncolloquy, was nonetheless testified to by Dr. Vorder Bruegge as\n\nrepresenting, in his expert opinion, a real person and events. Id.\n\nat 19.\n\n           Dr. Vorder Bruegge next testified regarding Exhibits 11\n\nthrough 15, stating generally that \"it is [his] opinion that these\n\npictures all depict real people and events.\"                 Id. at 20.   He was\n\nthen individually quizzed as to each of these images: Exhibit 11,\n\nid. at 23 (agreeing \"that the image depicts real people with real\n\nevents\"); Exhibit 12, id. (same); Exhibit 13, id. at 23-24 (same);\n\nExhibit   14,    id.   at    24   (same);    and   Exhibit    15,   id.   (same).\n\nDr.   Vorder    Bruegge     alternatively     based   his    opinion   regarding\n\n\n\n                                      -44-\n\fExhibits 11 through 15 on the fact that they were all part of the\n\n\"Helen series\" in one of the databases, id. at 25-26, and that\n\n\"they are high quality images with a lot of detail and there are\n\nmany of them.    That is the basis, being able to look at those\n\nimages and say, this is the same person and location and events,\n\n[that] enabled [Dr. Vorder Bruegge] to reach the opinion that they\n\nare real.\"   Id. at 27.\n\n          The government then jumped to Exhibit 17, proceeding to\n\nquestion Dr. Vorder Bruegge regarding this image in the same manner\n\nas it had regarding Exhibits 5 through 15, and establishing that of\n\nthe two persons depicted in the image, the girl laying below\n\ndepicted a real person, but the individual above her had been\n\nmanipulated in some way.   Id.\n\n          No questions were asked of Dr. Vorder Bruegge by the\n\ngovernment (nor anyone else) regarding Exhibit 16, and of course,\n\nneither did he testify that the image in said Exhibit 16 depicts a\n\nreal person, and thus, the government was short one image to prove\n\nthe enhancement sought against Appellant.\n\n          It is important to point out that immediately before\n\nDr. Vorder Bruegge was cross-examined by the defense, a discussion\n\narose regarding the status of Exhibits 1 through 19, that is,\n\nwhether they had been admitted into evidence, during which the\n\nfollowing exchange took place:\n\n\n\n\n                                 -45-\n\f                   THE COURT: There is no admission as to\n            the matter of being under age and having been\n            real images.\n\n                   [APPELLANT'S COUNSEL]: They're admitted\n            in the sense that they were images taken from\n            my client's computer.\n\n                   THE COURT: For those purposes they have\n            been admitted. For this matter [i.e., the\n            enhancement hearing], they have not been\n            admitted. . . .\n                   . . .\n                   [GOVERNMENT   COUNSEL]:    Except,   of\n            course, Exhibit No. 10[, which was part of the\n            plea].\n\nId. at 29.\n\n            Thus, there can be no question in anyone's mind that as\n\nto   all   these   exhibits    the    government     had    tendered      (that    is,\n\nExhibits 1 through 19, including 16, but except Exhibit 10), the\n\ngovernment had the burden of establishing that the images depicted\n\nreal persons.      At that point, of course, Dr. Vorder Bruegge was\n\nstill available to the government, and in fact, was still on the\n\nstand, under oath, and the defense had not even commenced cross-\n\nexamination.\n\n            Why the government failed to ask their expert, Dr. Vorder\n\nBruegge,     whether   or     not    the    image   depicted    in     Exhibit      16\n\nrepresented a real person is totally irrelevant.               What is relevant\n\n--   the    only   sure,    cold     fact     on    the    record    --    is     that\n\nnotwithstanding the fact that Dr. Vorder Breugge was available to\n\ntestify, that he had undisputably examined Exhibit 16 prior to\n\ntaking the stand, and that he testified to exhaustion as to all of\n\n\n                                       -46-\n\fthe other government exhibits, giving his expert opinion based on\n\nthe methodology described at length above, Dr. Vorder Bruegge did\n\nnot speak when it came to Exhibit 16, the critical tenth image.\n\n              I shall presently discuss the legal consequences of the\n\ninference raised by this silence.               Suffice it to say for the\n\npresent that the negative inference that is raised against the\n\ngovernment by its failure to inquire of Dr. Vorder Bruegge his\n\nopinion of the image in Exhibit 16 is compounded by the fact that\n\neven after the defense's cross-examination of Dr. Vorder Bruegge,\n\nthe government had a second opportunity to ask Dr. Vorder Bruegge\n\nabout this critical missing link when it engaged in redirect\n\nexamination of him, yet again failed to do so.                Id. at 43-44.\n\n              Appellant's counsel conducted a tactically deliberate\n\ncross-examination      of   Dr.   Vorder      Bruegge,   avoiding   mention     of\n\nExhibit 16 like the plague.            Id. at 31-43.      He was, of course,\n\nperfectly entitled not to inquire about a subject not raised in\n\ndirect examination and as to which the government had the burden of\n\nproof.    See Hilton II, 386 F.3d at 18.            He was also entitled to\n\ncount    on   the   district   court    not     coming   to   the   aid   of   the\n\ngovernment, a subject which I shall cover in more detail presently.\n\nHowever, what is worth mentioning at this time is that not only did\n\nthe government fail to inquire from Dr. Vorder Bruegge about\n\nExhibit 16, but the district court judge also did not at any time\n\navail himself of Dr. Vorder Bruegge's expertise, although obviously\n\n\n\n                                       -47-\n\fit had plenty of opportunity to do so before the expert was excused\n\nafter a friendly farewell.       See Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 45-56, Apr. 8,\n\n2005.\n\n             In actual sequence, Dr. Jaunarena's testimony followed\n\nthat of Dr. Vorder Bruegge, with his taking the stand on April 8,\n\n2005, and finalizing his testimony on April 13, 2005.                    Before\n\nresting its case, the government recalled Héctor X. Colón, an FBI\n\nagent   that    had    testified   on      direct   examination        back    on\n\nSeptember     29,   2004   regarding    retrieval   of    the    images       from\n\nAppellant's computer, see Evidentiary Hr'g Tr. 2, Sept. 29, 2004,\n\nto allow him to be cross-examined by Appellant, see Sentencing Hr'g\n\nTr. 57-58, Apr. 8, 2005.     We need not discuss his testimony further\n\nas it is not relevant to the issue of this appeal.              Suffice it to\n\nsay   that   eventually    the   government    rested    its    case    without\n\npresenting any evidence that Exhibit 16 depicted a real person.\n\nSee Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 12-13, Apr. 20, 2005.            Appellant's lawyer\n\nwisely did not fill the lacuna left open by the government.\n\n             Even at this late date in the proceedings, there was much\n\nequivocation and backtracking by both the government and the\n\ndistrict court on the evidence that had to be produced by the\n\ngovernment to prove that the images were of real children:\n\n                    [GOVERNMENT   COUNSEL]:   It  is   our\n             understanding that it remains after Ashcroft\n             versus Free Speech, that [it] is [an] element\n             of the offense that the children portrayed in\n             the child pornography images are correct.\n\n\n\n                                    -48-\n\f                    THE COURT: That is the law. You still\n             have to prove that they're real.    But they\n             backed off from Hilton [I] . . . . And now\n             additional evidence is not required. That is\n             what I understand.\n\n                    [GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: . . . [A]nd now\n             we're back to Nolan again. The United States\n             versus Nolan would still be good law, which\n             stood for the premise that a fact-finder can\n             make a determination without the requirement\n             of presenting expert witness testimony.\n\n                    THE COURT: That's right.     In other\n             words, I don't even need him, the doctor.23 I\n             don't even need him.\n\n                    [GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: That's correct.\n\n                    THE COURT: But you do need experts for\n             the real images?\n\n                    [GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: No, Your Honor.\n\n                    THE COURT: I don't?\n\n                    [GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: No, Your Honor.\n\n                    THE COURT: In other words, I can also\n             conclude the real images?\n\n                    [GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: Yes, Your Honor.\n\n\nSentencing Hr'g Tr. 98-99, Apr. 13, 2005 (footnote added).         The\n\ngovernment then argued that several circuit courts have decided\n\nsince the Ashcroft decision that expert testimony is not required\n\nto establish that images depict real persons.

The Crossing of the Rubicon:\n            The District Court Applies the Enhancements\n\n           The issue presented by this appeal came to a head on\n\nApril 26, 2005, when the court called a wrap-up hearing \"to examine\n\neach photograph to determine whether or not [it had] a real image\n\nand to determine whether or not . . . one of the 10 images [was] of\n\nprepubescent age.\"   Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 2, Apr. 26, 2005.   All went\n\nwell for the government as to Exhibits 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14,\n\nand 15.   Id. at 10-18.\n\n           Two problems arose, however, the first with Exhibit 9 and\n\nthe second with Exhibit 16.   The government needed at least one of\n\nthese two to go into evidence to meet the minimum ten images\n\nrequired for the sentencing enhancement.\n\n           The government ran into problems with Exhibit 9 early on.\n\nAlthough Dr. Vorder Bruegge testified that this exhibit was an\n\nimage reflecting real people and real events, this exhibit was not\n\n                                -51-\n\fshown to Dr. Jaunarena.     Id. at 13-15.    That being the case, the\n\ndistrict judge concluded that \"for the time being\" he would make no\n\ndetermination as to the age of the person.      Id. at 14.\n\n             But later on, the district judge stated with respect to\n\nExhibit 9:    \"[Dr. Jaunarena] jumped 9.    The Court will [therefore]\n\nnot make a finding as to this one.      I have doubts.\"      Id. at 23.\n\nThe judge then went on to say: \"So notwithstanding, I have 10 real\n\nimages, and one prepubescent age.    [The][t]en real images are 6, 7\n\nand 8.    That's three.    10, [four]; 11, [five]; 12, [six]; 13,\n\n[seven]; 14, [eight]; 15, nine; and 16, [ten].\"         Id. (emphasis\n\nadded).   The trouble with this arithmetic is, of course, that\n\nExhibit 16 suffered from the same defect as Exhibit 9, except in\n\nthe inverse.\n\n             Dr. Jaunarena had examined Exhibit 16, given his expert\n\nopinion, and been subject to cross examination regarding Exhibit\n\n16, but not regarding Exhibit 9, which was thus excluded.           The\n\nopposite was the case with respect to Exhibit 16: Dr. Vorder\n\nBruegge, although he examined Exhibit 9, subjected it to his expert\n\nmethodology, and gave his opinion regarding its contents, gave no\n\nevidence as to the crucial Exhibit 16, notwithstanding having\n\nexamined it in accordance with established scientific methodology,\n\nand additionally, notwithstanding his being within the control of\n\nthe government as its full-time employee.      Of course, since he did\n\nnot testify on the question of the reality of the image depicted in\n\n\n\n                                 -52-\n\fExhibit   16,   he   was   not   subjected   to   the   crucible   of   cross-\n\nexamination, or even to questioning by the court.\n\n           Counsel for Appellant made the best of what was obviously\n\na bad situation for his client, the district court having made an\n\napparent mid-course change based on its interpretation of the law.\n\nThe district judge concluded his factual determination:\n\n                  16 is real and a minor. The argument\n           as to 16 is that I have no proof that it's\n           real. He's right. I've examined the record,\n           and other than the photography, do not have an\n           expert. He's right.\n\n                  All right. He's right.   There is no\n           expert. . . . Nolan has not been overturned\n           now.\n\n                  So the Court, because there was no\n           evidence that it was not real, then I have to\n           use my judgement whether it was real or not,\n           and I conclude that it is real.\n\n                  Based on what? Based on the testimony\n           that the doctor provided as to all of the\n           other photographs, the criteria that he was\n           using. I'm going to borrow those criteria and\n           state that I conclude that 16 is also a real\n           image. That's it.\n                  . . .\n                  For me the critical matter was that I\n           received no evidence whatsoever that it was\n           not real. I see it, it looks real, and I use\n           the criteria of Dr. Vorder Bruegge . . . and\n           that's the end of the ballgame.\n\nId. at 38-39 (emphasis added).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -53-\n\f                  IV.   The Rest of the Ball Game\n\nA. Burdens, Inferences, and No-Hitters\n\n          Of course, it was hardly the \"end of the ball game,\" for\n\nthe burden was on the government to affirmatively prove that the\n\nimage in Exhibit 16 depicts a real person.   Hilton II, 386 F.3d at\n\n18 (\"It bears repeating that the government is not released from\n\nits burden of proof by a defendant's failure to argue, or by an\n\nabsence of evidence otherwise suggesting, the artificiality of the\n\nchildren portrayed.     That the children in the images are real\n\namounts to an element of the crime which the government must prove,\n\nthe burden of which should not be displaced to the defendant as an\n\naffirmative defense.\").    Appellant was not required to prove or\n\neven raise the reality issue.24\n\n          Not only did the district court inappropriately shift the\n\nburden, but it also lulled the defense into believing that the\n\n\n     24\n      Contrary to the majority's position, Nolan's statement that\nthe defendant is free to present evidence that the image in\nquestion is not real is inconsistent with the fact that the\ngovernment has the burden to prove that an image is real.\nRequiring the defendant to come forward with evidence on an element\nfor which the government has the burden of proof is an\nimpermissible shifting of the burden to the defendant. \"It is now\ngenerally recognized that the 'presumption of innocence' is an\ninaccurate, shorthand description of the right of the accused to\nremain inactive and secure, until the prosecution has taken up its\nburden and produced evidence and effected persuasion . . . .\"\nTaylor v. Kentucky, 436 U.S. 478, 483 n.12 (1978) (internal\nquotation marks omitted). As I explain in more depth below, the\nprobability that an image is not real is high enough to require the\ngovernment to present some evidence to the contrary. Otherwise, as\na matter of law, the government's evidence is insufficient to meet\nits burden of proof.\n\n                                  -54-\n\fburden was fully on the government to prove by expert testimony\n\nthat ten images were real.            The defendant based his defense\n\nstrategy on that belief.        But on the last day of the sentencing\n\nhearing, as described above, the district court suddenly switched\n\ngears,    permitting   itself   as   the    factfinder   to   make   its    own\n\ndetermination without any expert help.\n\n            Furthermore, the district court's error in failing to\n\nplace due weight on the government's burden was compounded in this\n\ncase because Dr. Vorder Bruegge's failure or refusal to testify\n\nregarding the reality of Exhibit 16 raises an inference, unrebutted\n\nby competent evidence, that the reality of Exhibit 16 was in doubt.\n\nSee United States v. Charles, 738 F.2d 686, 698 (5th Cir. 1984)\n\n(\"In general, the failure to produce a favorable witness or other\n\nevidence when it is peculiarly within a party's power to do so\n\ncreates    an   inference   that     the    witness'   testimony     will   be\n\nunfavorable.\"); see also Graves v.

DeVita, 526 F.2d 81, 83 (9th Cir.\n\n1975) (\"Indeed, from the government's failure to produce a single\n\nitem of evidence from the surveillance in support of founded\n\nsuspicion, the only rational inference was that the informant was\n\nunreliable at the time he gave the second tip.\").\n\n          In this case:\n\n          (1) Dr. Vorder Bruegge, an FBI expert of questioned\n\nphotographic evidence with impeccable credentials, was available to\n\ntestify regarding the image in Exhibit 16;\n\n          (2) Dr. Vorder Bruegge had Exhibit 16 in his possession\n\nand it was therefore available for inspection, study, and analysis\n\nin accordance with the scientifically recognized methodology to\n\nwhich he testified;\n\n          (3) Dr. Vorder Bruegge gave his expert opinion regarding\n\nnine other government exhibits, which were similar in nature to\n\n\n\n\n                                    -56-\n\fExhibit 16 and which he also had in his possession and inspected,\n\nstudied, and analyzed in accordance with the mentioned methodology;\n\n           (4) Dr. Vorder Bruegge testified that in his opinion the\n\nnine other exhibits depict real persons and incidents;\n\n           (5)   Dr.       Vorder    Bruegge       failed    to   testify    regarding\n\nwhether or not the image and scene depicted in Exhibit 16 is real.\n\n           In    view      of   these      unassailable       facts,   the    rational\n\ninference arising from the record before the district court is that\n\nhad Dr. Vorder Bruegge testified regarding Exhibit 16 on the issue\n\nof the \"disputed transaction,\" i.e., whether or not the image\n\ndepicts a real person, his testimony would have been unfavorable to\n\nthe government's contention that it depicts a real person.                            See\n\nWest, 393 F.3d at 1309.           Yet the district court nowhere addressed\n\nthis   inference      or    the     fact    that    the     government      offered     no\n\nappropriate evidence to overcome the inference, and in fact no such\n\nevidence was available on the record before the district court.\n\nB. The Majority's Galileo Conundrum\n\n           In making its present contention that expert testimony is\n\nunnecessary     for   a    factfinder       to     determine      whether    or   not    a\n\nphotograph depicts a real person, the government blithely chooses\n\nto overlook the paper trail that it has left and in which it took\n\na   diametrically         opposed     position.           Unfortunately       for     the\n\ngovernment, it is a trail that is not easily hidden and cannot be\n\n\n\n\n                                           -57-\n\ffacilely bypassed, for it runs through, and has been noted in, high\n\nplaces, as well as places that are not so high.\n\n            When before the Supreme Court in Free Speech Coalition,\n\narguing    in    favor    of        the   constitutionality        of   the      statutory\n\nprovision       that    banned       virtual      pornographic      reproductions        of\n\nchildren as well as real images, the government contended that\n\n\"[v]irtual images . . . are indistinguishable from real ones . . .\n\n[and even e]xperts . . . may have difficulty in saying whether the\n\npictures were made by using real children or by using computer\n\nimaging.\"       535 U.S. at 254 (emphasis added).                We took note of the\n\ngovernment's position on this very point when we decided Hilton II.\n\n386 F.3d    at 17 (\"The government's second argument [in Free Speech\n\nCoalition]       was     that       eliminating         actual     child     pornography\n\nnecessitates the prohibition on virtual pornography because virtual\n\nimages are indistinguishable from real ones.\"                      (emphasis added)).\n\n            That       virtual      and    real      child   pornography      images     are\n\nindistinguishable,            and     that      even     experts     have        difficulty\n\ndetermining      what    is     real      and   what    is   virtual,      are    not   only\n\nundeniable scientific judgments promoted by the government in Free\n\nSpeech Coalition and Hilton II, they are also conclusions which\n\nwere   unquestionably           verified        in     the   present    case       by   the\n\ngovernment's own actions, including the testimony of its own expert\n\nwitness, Dr. Vorder Bruegge.

Cf. Hilton II, 386 F.3d at 18-19 (rejecting\n\nthe government's argument that it was \"commonsensical\" that because\n\nan expert pediatrician testified that the images depict minor\n\n\n\n                                      -59-\n\fchildren, this testimony was sufficient to establish the further\n\nelement of reality).   If an expert pediatrician is unqualified to\n\nrender an opinion as to the reality of an image depicting children,\n\nhow is it possible for a district judge to do so without any\n\npersonal expertise on the subject, without the aid of expert\n\nopinion to help him reach a conclusion as to the reality of that\n\nphotograph, and without the benefit of peer review?\n\n          This was substantially what Appellant's lawyer argued to\n\nthe district court:\n\n                 You are quite an accomplished lawyer,\n          but you are not an expert, the Court is not an\n          expert on identification. . . .

The Court\n          doesn't have the parameters to determine\n          whether the eyes, the skin, muscle tone and\n          skeletal structure are consistent. The Court\n          doesn't have any of the qualifications that\n          Dr. Vorder Bruegge said were indispensable for\n          him to reach a conclusion. The Court has not\n          been cross-checked by another expert like Dr.\n          Vorder Bruegge says he has.\n                 The Court has no standards upon which\n          to base this determination, that photograph 16\n          is . . . a real image of a person.\n\n\n\n\n                               -60-\n\fSentencing Hr'g Tr. 24-25, Apr. 26, 2005.

See United States v.\n\nSlanina, 359 F.3d 356, 357 (5th Cir. 2004) (per curiam) (\"[T]he\n\nGovernment was not required to present any additional evidence or\n\nexpert testimony to meet its burden of proof to show that the\n\nimages downloaded by Slanina depicted real children, and not\n\nvirtual children.\"); Becht v. United States, 403 F.3d 541, 549-50\n\n(8th Cir. 2005) (citing United States v. Deaton, 328 F.3d 454, 455\n\n(8th Cir. 2003) (per curiam)); United States v. Sims, 428 F.3d 945,\n\n956-57 (10th Cir. 2005) (citing United States v. Kimler, 335 F.3d\n\n1132, 1142 (10th Cir. 2003)); United States v. Farrelly, 389 F.3d\n\n649, 653-54 (6th Cir. 2004), abrogated on other grounds by United\n\nStates v. Williams, 411 F.3d 675, 678 n.1 (6th Cir. 2005); United\n\nStates v. Hall, 312 F.3d 1250, 1260 (11th Cir. 2002) (citing United\n\nStates v. Richardson, 304 F.3d 1061, 1064 & n.2 (11th Cir. 2002)).\n\n          There are several reasons why adherence to Nolan by this\n\npanel regarding the specific issue before us -- i.e., whether the\n\ngovernment needs an expert witness to establish that the person\n\ndepicted is real -- is not required, the first two reasons being\n\nrelated to the year in which Nolan was decided, 1987.\n\n          First, it is clear that Nolan was dealing with images\n\nreproduced before 1986.     See 818 F.2d at 1016 (\"The parties\n\nstipulated that on June 3 and 6, 1985, United States Customs mail\n\nspecialists discovered Swedish parcels mailed to Nolan, containing\n\n\n\n                               -62-\n\fa number of [child pornography] publications . . . .\").        According\n\nto the testimony of the government's witness in the present case,\n\nDr. Vorder Bruegge, the Nolan images could not have been anything\n\nbut real -- and therefore there was no need for expert testimony in\n\nthat case -- because it was not \"until long after\" the FBI created\n\nthe CEORF database in 1986 that the technology became available to\n\ncreate a virtual image of a person.           Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 26,\n\nApr. 7, 2005.   Thus, the government's need for an expert witness to\n\nestablish the reality of the images in Nolan is, by today's\n\nscientific standards, a non-issue.       But there is more to this.\n\n           We said in Nolan that \"the test for a factfinder's power\n\nto judge evidence without expert help is . . . whether the subject\n\nis within the range of normal experience and knowledge.\"        818 F.2d\n\nat 1018.    As the government's conduct clearly establishes, as\n\nDr. Vorder Bruegge's testimony strongly reinforces, and further, as\n\nboth Free Speech Coalition and Hilton II recognize, determining\n\nwhether an image is real or virtually created is not only no longer\n\nwithin the \"range of normal experience and knowledge\" of the\n\naverage person, but it may also very well be \"difficult\" for even\n\nexperts \"[to say] whether the pictures were made by using real\n\nchildren or by using computer imaging.\" Free Speech Coalition, 535\n\nU.S. at 254.    Additionally, the Supreme Court was not just relying\n\non the arguments of the parties in Free Speech Coalition; it\n\nspecifically    said   that   \"[t]he   new   technology,   according   to\n\n\n\n                                  -63-\n\fCongress, makes it possible to create realistic images of children\n\nwho do not exist.\"          Id. at 240 (emphasis added).\n\n            The fact is that Nolan is today scientifically unsound,\n\nand slavish insistence upon its outmoded dogma is the equivalent to\n\ninsisting on a modern day Galileo conundrum.25                  The scientific\n\nevidence available today is overwhelmingly contrary to that which\n\nexisted in Nolan's day, and in the present case, it is clearly\n\nestablished by the uncontradicted testimony of the government's own\n\nexpert witness, Dr. Vorder Bruegge, Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 12, 30-31\n\nApr. 7, 2005 (testifying about a course the expert took at the FBI\n\nlaboratory taught by Professor Peter Ratner, who runs a program at\n\nJames Madison University on creating computer-generated people, and\n\nalso testifying that \"the state-of-the-art of image processing is\n\nsuch that someone . . . with a sufficient, significant amount of\n\nskill, time and willingness to spend the time can create a perfect\n\nfake    image.\"),      as   well   by   the   pronouncements   of   Free   Speech\n\nCoalition and Hilton II.           There is simply no question that today it\n\nis     possible   to    create      virtual     images   of   humans   that   are\n\nindistinguishable from the real thing.26\n\n       25\n      Galileo was tried by the Inquisition in 1633 on suspicion of\nheresy for his defense of heliocentrism, Copernicus's theory that\nthe earth revolved around the sun, rather than that the earth was\nthe center of the universe.\n       26\n      Suggested reading includes: Hany Farid, Digital Doctoring:\nHow to Tell the Real from the Fake, 3 Significance 162 (2006),\navailable at http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/farid/publications/\nsignificance06.pdf (\"Today's technology allows digital media to be\naltered and manipulated in ways that were simply impossible twenty\n\n                                         -64-\n\f            Furthermore, Nolan's ruling that the government need not\n\ncall   a   photography   expert    \"to       negate    the   mere   speculative\n\npossibility of such fakery,\" 818 F.2d at 1018-19, cannot stand\n\nagainst the present record.       First of all, Nolan conceded that the\n\npictures were \"on their face, representations of what looked like\n\nminors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\"               Id. at 1017.   That\n\nis not the present case.

The human eye can\nnow rarely detect [photographic tampering]. That becomes critical\nin the court room, where digital photographs are used as evidence\n. . . .\").    Perhaps a good starting point for the technically\nimpaired (i.e., most judges) is Timothy J. Perla, Note, Attempting\nto End the Cycle of Virtual Pornography Prohibitions, 83 B.U. L.\nRev. 1209 (2003), which among other things contains an excellent\noverview and explanation of the technical aspects of this entire\narea in fairly understandable terms, and which states:\n\n       There is wide agreement that an ordinary person cannot\n       generally tell a real image from a virtual one. Most\n       commentators also agree that technology is quickly\n       evolving to the point where even an expert will not be\n       able to differentiate real and virtual images.\n\nId. at 1220; cf. Maria Aspan, Media; Ease of Alteration Creates\nWoes for Picture Editors, N.Y. Times, Aug. 14, 2006, at C4\n(demonstrating   that  even   professional   photo  editors   are\nincreasingly duped by altered photographic images); Cheryl\nJohnston, Digital Deception, Am. Journalism Rev., May 1, 2003, at\n10 (same).\n\n     To the extent the majority suggests that the above articles do\nnot stand for my proposition, I simply rest on the text of the\narticles and suggest that the articles be read more carefully.\n\n                                      -65-\n\fAppellant      only   admitted    to   possessing    one    photograph     whose\n\n\"depictions     represent    a    minor   engaging   in    sexually     explicit\n\nconduct\" -- he contested \"everything else.\"                Exhibit 16 was, of\n\ncourse, not the one admitted to by Appellant.               Thus, contrary to\n\nwhat the court in Nolan expected of that defendant, id. at 1020 n.4\n\n(\"The defense produced no expert of its own to show that the\n\npictures were fakes or other than what they appeared to be.\"),\n\nunder the present state of the law, \"[a]fter Free Speech Coalition,\n\nthe government must prove that an image depicts actual children[,]\n\n. . . [and] the government is not released from its burden of proof\n\nby a defendant's failure to argue, or by an absence of evidence\n\notherwise suggesting, the artificiality of the children portrayed.\n\nThat the children in the images are real amounts to an element of\n\nthe crime which the government must prove, the burden of which\n\nshould   not    be    displaced   to   the    defendant    as   an   affirmative\n\ndefense.\" Hilton II, 386 F.3d at 18 (citing Free Speech Coalition,\n\n535 U.S. at 256).       In this the government failed and the district\n\ncourt was unwarranted in filling the gap.\n\n            Because the legal and scientific underpinnings of Nolan\n\nare no longer with us, we should allow that case to rest in peace\n\nwithout further ado.        See Vásquez v. Hillery, 474 U.S. 254, 266\n\n(1986) (\"Our history does not impose any rigid formula to constrain\n\nthe Court in the disposition of cases.           Rather, its lesson is that\n\nevery successful proponent of overruling precedent has borne the\n\n\n\n                                       -66-\n\fheavy burden of persuading the Court that changes in society or in\n\nthe law dictate that the values served by stare decisis yield in\n\nfavor of a greater objective.\").       I believe this is an occasion\n\nlike that in Carpenters Local Union No. 26 v. United States\n\nFidelity & Guaranty Co., in which we stated:\n\n          When emergent Supreme Court case law calls\n          into question a prior opinion of another\n          court, that court should pause to consider its\n          likely significance before giving effect to an\n          earlier decision. . . . Let us be perfectly\n          clear.    We value finality, stability and\n          certainty in the law, particularly in the\n          field of statutory construction.     But stare\n          decisis is neither a straightjacket nor an\n          immutable rule; it leaves room for courts to\n          balance their respect for precedent against\n          insights gleaned from new developments, and to\n          make informed judgments as to whether earlier\n          decisions retain preclusive force.\n\n215 F.3d 136, 141-42 (1st Cir. 2000) (citations omitted); see also\n\nEulitt v. Me. Dep't of Educ., 386 F.3d 344, 349 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\nStewart v. Dutra Constr. Co., 230 F.3d 461, 467 (1st Cir. 2000),\n\nrev'd, 543 U.S. 481 (2005);   Williams v.

On the Question of Our Sister Courts of Appeal\n\n          Although the views of other courts of appeal are usually\n\nheavily persuasive, I submit, with all due respect, that on the\n\nissue before us the other courts of appeal that have considered\n\nthis matter have not reached the correct conclusion.      Again with\n\n                                -67-\n\fdue   respect   to   those   who   differ   from   me,   arithmetic   is   not\n\ndeterminative of scientific truth.          It made no difference how many\n\ncardinals said that the sun revolved around the earth, it did not\n\nmake this asseveration a scientific truth. And it is scientific\n\ntruth that trumps the day on the issue before this court.              It is\n\nnow beyond scientific dispute that it is possible to create virtual\n\nphotographic images that can only be detected (with difficulty) by\n\nexperts.   Thus, experts are required before factfinders can make\n\ntheir findings on this issue.27         I do not recall any mention of\n\nthis scientific knowledge, one way or another, in any of the\n\nappellate opinions cited in opposition to my views.28\n\n      27\n       It is not unusual to require expert testimony -- or at least\ntestimony of an appropriately knowledgeable lay person -- in other\nareas of the law when an opinion is based on specialized knowledge\nand the assistance of an expert is indispensable. See, e.g., Fed.\nR. Evid. 701, 702; United States v. Walters, 904 F.2d 765, 770 (1st\nCir. 1990) (requiring expert testimony or the opinion of a\nknowledgeable lay person to establish the illicit nature of a\nsubstance); United States v. Dixon, 185 F.3d 393, 406 (5th Cir.\n1999) (holding that expert testimony would be needed to explain a\ndefendant's medical records in order to show that he satisfied the\ntest for insanity); Reed v. Sullivan, 988 F.2d 812, 819 (8th Cir.\n1993) (finding that expert testimony was needed to establish\nwhether a disabled person could perform certain sedentary jobs);\nSalem v. United States Lines Co., 370 U.S. 31, 32 (1962) (requiring\nexpert testimony to prove negligence on the part of a ship owner\nwho had failed to provide railings on a ladder leading to a crows\nnest).\n      28\n      Some of the cases respond to the argument that due to\ntechnological advances, Free Speech Coalition requires the use of\nexpert testimony to prove that an image is real by claiming that\nthe Supreme Court in that very case said that the hypothesis that\nreal images are indistinguishable from virtual images is \"somewhat\nimplausible.\"   See Kimler, 335 F.3d at 1142; United States v.\nFarrelly, 389 F.3d at 655. These cases, however, misquote Free\nSpeech Coalition. The \"hypothesis\" that the Supreme Court found\n\n                                     -68-\n\f          For the reasons stated above, I respectfully dissent.   I\n\nwould reverse and remand this case for resentencing.\n\n\n\n\nimplausible is that \"virtual images promote trafficking in works\nproduced through the exploitation of real children,\" not that real\nimages are indistinguishable from virtual ones. 535 U.S. at 254.\n\n                              -69-\n\f",

The court accepted defendant's guilty plea and stated that it would address the enhancement issue at sentencing. Defendant waived jury determination of the disputed sentencing enhancements. At that time, the government indicated it had expert reports to support its position on guilt and sentencing.

The question of whether or not a particular image is of a virtual child or of a real child is an issue of fact, to be determined by the trier of fact. <i>United States v.

The defendant in <i>Nolan</i> argued that \"the prosecution failed to prove that the pictures were not composite representations or otherwise faked or doctored, or ... computer-generated\" or even \"fabricated using photographs of nude children taken from legitimate sources.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1016. <i>Nolan</i> held that the mere possibility, unsupported by evidence, that the images could have been produced by use of technology and not using real children was not sufficient to reject a lower court's ruling founded on reasonable inferences derived from experience and common sense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court that <i>Nolan</i> has not been overruled by <i>Free Speech Coalition.</i> To start, <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> did not arise from a criminal prosecution. Rather, the case was a civil suit seeking declaratory and injunctive relief; it concerned a First Amendment facial overbreadth attack on certain provisions of the CPPA. 535 U.S. at 243-44, 122 S.Ct. 1389. The Court held overbroad and unconstitutional the provision of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(8)(B),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> which stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(8) \"child pornography\" means any visual depiction, including any photograph, film, video, picture, or computer or computer-generated image or picture, whether made or produced by electronic, mechanical, or other means, of sexually explicit conduct, where&#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) such visual depiction is, <i>or appears to be,</i> of a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 241, 256, 122 S.Ct. 1389 (emphasis added). The First Amendment overbreadth issue arose from the \"or appears to be\" language of that section, by which Congress sought to punish possession of virtual images, which did not involve real children. <i>Id.</i> at 241.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Earlier, in <i>New York v. Ferber,</i> 458 U.S. 747, 102 S.Ct. 3348, 73 L.Ed.2d 1113 (1982), the Supreme Court had upheld against First Amendment attack a state child pornography statute which did not purport to prohibit virtual images, but only images of real children. <i>Id.</i> at 765, 773-74, 102 S.Ct. 3348. The Court in <i>Ferber</i> upheld the state statute against First Amendment attack, even though the statute prohibited material that would not be obscene,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> because the production of child pornography utilizing real children necessarily harmed the children. <i>Id.</i> at 759-60, 102 S.Ct. 3348; <i>id.</i> at 758 &amp; n. 9, 102 S.Ct. 3348 (noting the legislative judgment that \"the use of children as subjects of pornographic materials is harmful to the physiological, emotional, and mental health of the child[ren]\"); <i>see also United States v.

Virtual child pornography is not `intrinsically related' to the sexual abuse of children.\" (quoting <i>Ferber,</i> 458 U.S. at 759, 102 S.Ct. 3348)). As a result, <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> held that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2256(8)(B) was overbroad because of the \"or appears to be\" clause. <i>Id.</i> at 256, 122 S.Ct. 1389.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court in <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> did not rule on the nature of the proof the government must produce to demonstrate that an image of a child was of a real child. That argument was not before the Court, which had before it only the issue of the facial constitutionality of the statute. There was also no issue as to whether the statute had been unconstitutionally applied to an image which the government had failed to prove was of a real child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The remaining provisions of the CPPA, not struck, remain intact. The unconstitutional provisions of the Act, which expanded the prohibition against child pornography to encompass materials that did not involve the use of real children, are severable from the CPPA, and did not affect the constitutional viability of provisions regulating possession of traditional child pornography. <i>See United States v. Kimler,</i> 335 F.3d 1132, 1141 (10th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 1083, 124 S.Ct. 945, 157 L.Ed.2d 759 (2003); <i>United States v. Kelly,</i> 314 F.3d 908, 911 (7th Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 538 U.S. 1001, 123 S.Ct. 1923, 155 L.Ed.2d 829 (2003); <i>United States v.

Since the Supreme Court did not address the issue before us, and since the statute as excised survives, our pre-CPPA case law, including <i>Nolan,</i> survives as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our reading of the effect of <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> agrees with that of every circuit that has addressed the question. For example, in <i>United States v. Irving,</i> 452 F.3d 110 (2d Cir.2006), the court upheld a jury verdict convicting defendant of possession of child pornography based on videos where the government offered no proof beyond the videos themselves that the images were of real children. <i>Id.</i> at 122. Rejecting the argument that <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> necessarily created a bright-line rule, the court noted:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the Supreme Court noted the possible evidentiary difficulty of distinguishing virtual and actual child pornography, it did not establish a bright-line rule requiring that the government proffer a specific type of proof to show the use of an actual child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 121 (citing <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 254-56, 122 S.Ct. 1389). <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> does not lay down \"the absolute requirement that, absent direct evidence of identity, expert testimony is required to prove that the prohibited images are of real, not virtual, children.\" <i>Kimler,</i> 335 F.3d at 1142; <i>see also Farrelly,</i> 389 F.3d at 653-54; <i>United States v. Slanina,</i> 359 F.3d 356, 357 (5th Cir.2004) (per curiam); <i>United States v. Deaton,</i> 328 F.3d 454, 455 (8th Cir.2003) (per curiam). The same cases universally accept the proposition that juries are capable of distinguishing between real and virtual images, without expert assistance. <i>Irving,</i> 452 F.3d at 122 (video images); <i>Farrelly,</i> 389 F.3d at 654; <i>Slanina,</i> 359 F.3d at 357; <i>Kimler,</i> 335 F.3d at 1142; <i>Deaton,</i> 328 F.3d at 455. In a number of cases evaluating the effect of erroneous jury instructions, the appellate courts have examined images themselves and, on that basis, determined that those images were of real children. <i>See Becht v. United States,</i> 403 F.3d 541, 549 (8th Cir.2005); <i>Hall,</i> 312 F.3d at 1260; <i>United States v.

We understand the dissent to join this argument, but not to argue that <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> itself overrules <i>Nolan.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A panel of this court is normally bound to follow an earlier panel decision that is closely on point, unless an exception exists to the principles of <i>stare decisis.

As a leading commentator has stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The doctrine of stare decisis provides that courts must abide by or adhere to cases that have been previously decided and that a legal decision on an issue of law that is contained in a final judgment is binding in all future cases on the court that made the legal decision and all other courts that owe obedience to that court. In other words, the doctrine of stare decisis incorporates two principles: (1) a court is bound by its own prior legal decisions unless there are substantial reasons to abandon a decision; and (2) a legal decision rendered by a court will be followed by all courts inferior to it in the judicial system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3 J.

This exception does not apply here, as there is no Supreme Court opinion, en banc opinion of this circuit, or statute that overrules <i>Nolan.</i> We have also recognized a second, limited exception that permits one panel to overrule another in \"those relatively rare instances in which authority that postdates the original decision, although not directly controlling, nevertheless offers a sound reason for believing that the former panel, in light of fresh developments, would change its collective mind.\" <i>Id.</i> The second exception likewise does not apply to this case. The dissent argues that we should overrule <i>Nolan</i> under this second exception in part because of technological developments. But the \"fresh developments\" considered in <i>Williams</i> were not technological changes but rather fresh developments in the law in the form of the views of another circuit court. <i>Id.; see also Carpenters Local Union No. 26 v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar.

Maine,</i> 386 F.3d 344 (1st Cir.2004), stating that \"[a] second exception exists when recent <i>Supreme Court</i> precedent calls into legitimate question a prior opinion of an inferior court.\" <i>Id.</i> at 350 (emphasis added) (citing <i>Carpenters Local,</i> 215 F.3d at 141 (overruling circuit precedent in light of two Supreme Court cases); <i>Crowe v. Bolduc,</i> 365 F.3d 86, 89, 92 (1st Cir.2004) (overruling circuit precedent in light of a Supreme Court case)). Further, in <i>United States v. Guzm&#225;n,</i> 419 F.3d 27 (1st Cir.2005), the court described the second <i>Williams</i> exception as applying in \"instances that fairly may be described as hen's-teeth rare.\" <i>Id.</i> at 31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Nolan</i> rule is that the issue on appeal of whether a pornographic image is of a real child is to be treated as a sufficiency of the evidence question, evaluating the evidence as a whole. There is no reason, much less a compelling reason based on new facts, to abandon that rule,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> even assuming that new fact developments may lead to abandonment by one panel of a prior circuit precedent. The Supreme Court has recognized in itself (but not necessarily in the circuit courts) the power to depart from <i>stare decisis</i> \"to bring its opinions into agreement with experience and with facts newly ascertained.\" <i>Vasquez v. Hillery,</i> 474 U.S. 254, 266, 106 S.Ct. 617, 88 L.Ed.2d 598 (1986) (quoting <i>Burnet v. Coronado Oil &amp; Gas Co.,</i> 285 U.S. 393, 412, 52 S.Ct. 443, 76 L.Ed. 815 (1932) (Brandeis, J., dissenting)) (internal quotation marks omitted). The present rule, rather than an inflexible rule requiring that expert evidence must be provided by the prosecution, reflects a far better method to accommodate developments in technology. No occasion is presented here to depart from the principles of <i>stare decisis</i> based on technological developments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant and the dissent also rely on language in <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> indicating that Congress was concerned that new technology made it possible to produce realistic virtual images and, as technology improved, experts may have difficulty distinguishing virtual images from real images. But defendant and the dissent insufficiently appreciate language in <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> that refers to the continuing use of real children:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If virtual images were identical to illegal child pornography, the illegal images would be driven from the market by the indistinguishable substitutes. Few pornographers would risk prosecution by abusing real children if fictional, computerized images would suffice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 254, 122 S.Ct. 1389.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whatever improvements may eventually be made in technology,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> the Supreme Court's observation about the market for child pornography is still correct. There is no basis to assume that the producers of child pornography have widely converted to exclusive use of virtual pornography. Even before <i>Free Speech Coalition, Nolan</i> made the point that, given the proliferation and sheer number of the pornographic images available, common sense strongly suggests that many of the images on the market are of real children. 818 F.2d at 1018.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there any reason to think that the exploitation of real children to produce pornography has ceased. We know as a matter of fact that the market continues using real children to produce pornography because the cases, including this one, continue to have in them direct evidence that a real child was used. <i>See, e.g., Frabizio,</i> 459 F.3d at 82 &amp; n. 3; <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 459 F.3d 1276, 1287 (11th Cir. 2006); <i>United States v. Mack,</i> 452 F.3d 744, 745 (8th Cir.2006). In this case, multiple images taken from defendant's computer were identified as depicting real children, after comparing the images to those compiled in the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Reference File and the database maintained by the FBI's Child Victim Identification Program. Defendant himself admitted that one of the images was of a real child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there any reason to assume that particular images on which a prosecution is based have been produced by such superior technology. In this case, for example, certain of the images had been published in magazines from the 1970s or 1980s, well before there was the capacity to do any realistic form of virtual imaging.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burden of proof remains on the government to prove the pornographic image is of a real child. The overarching legal point is the holding stated in <i>Nolan:</i> \"[T]he prosecution was not required, as part of its affirmative case, to rule out every conceivable way the pictures could have been made other than by ordinary photography.\" 818 F.2d at 1020; <i>see also United States v. Smith,</i> 680 F.2d 255, 259 (1st Cir.1982) (\"The Government ... need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, provided the record as a whole supports a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"); 26 J. Moore et al., <i>Moore's Federal Practice</i> &#167; 629.05[2] (3d ed. 2006) (\"Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not require that the government adduce evidence excluding all reasonable defense theories, thereby leaving only the conclusion of guilt independently proved.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We should not be misunderstood: the government at all times has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence at sentencing, and the defendant has no burden. There is nothing inconsistent between the government's having that burden and <i>Nolan's</i> statement that the defendant, while under no obligation to do so, was \"free to have presented evidence of his own suggesting that the picture[] used other than real subjects. He could have called an expert to testify as to how photographs like [this one] could have been made without using real children.\" <i>Nolan,</i> 818 F.2d at 1020. If defendant had chosen to mount a defense of this type and presented such expert testimony, and had the government not called an expert to explain why the image was real, the government ran the risk of not persuading the trier of fact. This does not shift the burden of proof. The evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence is done on the record as a whole, not on \"bright line\" tests such as the one defendant advances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Unpreserved Arguments Made by the Dissent</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent injects new arguments into the case which were not raised by Rodriguez-Pacheco in the district court or on appeal. As such, the arguments have been waived. <i>See United States v. Gobbi,</i> 471 F.3d 302, 312 n. 4 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent first makes the novel argument that the proceedings below were unfair and so the defendant was sandbagged. Defendant never made this argument at any time. If defendant thought there was procedural unfairness, he would have said so. The dissent's procedural unfairness argument is without merit in any event. The argument seems to be that defendant came to expect there would be an expert opinion on each of the ten images, and his disappointed expectations mean the case should be remanded. The argument, which has other deficiencies, ignores the fact that when the government prepared the case, the panel opinion in <i>Hilton I</i> required expert testimony, and so the case proceeded on that basis. Before the expert gave his testimony, the law had changed, the rule in <i>Hilton I</i> had been withdrawn, and the defense was well aware of the change. Defendant knew from the outset of the sentencing hearing that the government would present an expert on the reality of the images. Yet he chose not to introduce his own expert, or offer any evidence of his own that the images were not of real children. Further, the district court's reference to \"scientific, technical or other specialized skill\" to help it determine the reality of children depicted in the prosecution's exhibits came when it explained its reasons for admitting Dr. Vorder Bruegge as an expert witness, over defense counsel's objection. That could not have misled defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent next makes the novel argument that it was error for the district court not to sua sponte infer from the government's failure to ask Dr. Vorder Bruegge for his opinion on Exhibit 16, that he would have said, if asked, that the image was not of a real child. The defense did not ask for such an inference;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> its argument was that, whatever the government's reasons for not questioning the expert on Exhibit 16, only an expert, not a court or even a jury as factfinder, could make that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent also gains no support from cases in which adverse inferences are requested and drawn, based on a party's failure to produce a witness at all. <i>See, e.g., Olszewski v. Spencer,</i> 466 F.3d 47, 61 (1st Cir.2006). Here, there was no failure to produce a witness, only a failure to ask a particular question from a produced witness. Further, no inference can be drawn, contrary to the dissent, from the district court's failure to take over the examination of the witness when Exhibit 16 was not raised during questioning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the dissent makes another argument which was not made by defendant on appeal. Defendant's argument on appeal is that the law requires the government to produce the opinion of an expert that an image is of a real child, and, since no such opinion was offered, <i>therefore</i> the evidence was insufficient, regardless of the other evidence. We have rejected that legal proposition. The dissent makes a different argument that the remaining evidence was insufficient as a matter of evidence. The dissent confuses the role of the expert with the district court's role as factfinder. That argument is also waived. Nonetheless, we discuss why the argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government met its burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. The district court as finder of fact was entitled to use Dr. Vorder Bruegge's testimony about criteria relevant to determining whether an image is real to assist it in making its own determination concerning Exhibit 16. The expert testified that computer-generated images have difficulty recreating the characteristics of human eyes and skin. He also stressed the importance of evaluating how individuals in an image interact with one another and their environment&#8212;factors to consider included shadows, gravity, and the effect of pressure on a human body. The expert also evaluated flesh and muscle tone on human images. The district court judge adopted Dr. Vorder Bruegge's methodology, making clear that his conclusion as to the reality of the child in Exhibit 16 was \"[b]ased on the testimony that [the expert] provided as to all of the other photographs [and] the criteria that he was using.\" Further, the judge \"conclude[d] that the skin, that the tonation of the muscles, that both hands on the thighs of the male impress the Court that this is not a virtual image but it is a real image.\" The district court made these findings, applying Dr. Vorder Bruegge's methodology. That is sufficient. The district court had sufficient evidence, and no evidence to the contrary,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> to conclude that Exhibit 16 depicted a real child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having addressed the dissent's additional arguments, we note that defendant himself does not otherwise challenge the court's finding that the tenth image is of a real child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On appeal, defendant does not dispute the court's finding that one of the images is of a prepubescent minor or a child under the age of twelve.

The government has failed to meet its burden of establishing by competent evidence a crucial element that must be proven before the district court can apply enhanced sentencing factors. <i>See Ashcroft v. Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. 234, 256, 122 S.Ct. 1389, 152 L.Ed.2d 403 (2002) (clarifying that the government may not criminalize possession of non-obscene sexually explicit images that appear to be, but do not in fact, depict real children); <i>United States v. Hilton</i> (<i>Hilton II</i>), 386 F.3d 13, 19 (1st Cir.2004) (same). Thus appellant has not received all the process that is due to him. Because my colleagues in the majority have concluded otherwise, I am compelled to respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Succinctly put, for the sentencing enhancement established in U.S.S.G. &#167; 2G2.4(b)(2) (2002) to be validly applied by the district court in this case, the government had to establish that Appellant David Rodr&#237;guez-Pacheco (\"Appellant\") possessed at least ten proscribed images. The government only properly proved that he possessed nine images of actual, real minors. Unfortunately, after the close of the evidence, the district judge erroneously proceeded to provide the missing link by concluding, without adequate foundation in the evidence, that there was a tenth image of an actual person. Because there was no such tenth image established by adequate proof, in my opinion, we have no alternative but to disallow the resulting sentence, and to remand the case for appropriate sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As will be shown hereinafter, the district court committed three pivotal errors, related in nature, but distinct in factual and legal significance. Individually and collectively these errors inevitably lead to the outcome I suggest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, if we consider the district court's rulings throughout most of the sentencing process, Appellant was led to believe that the government would need to prove the reality of the persons depicted for all of the images introduced to prove the sentencing enhancement. The court's last minute change of course, whereby it effectively relieved the government of its burden, was not only a legally incorrect shifting of the burden that properly belongs to the government, <i>see Hilton II,</i> 386 F.3d at 18, but it also left Appellant high and dry at a point in the proceedings when it was most tactically disadvantageous. Second, although the government presented competent evidence regarding the reality of nine of the ten images introduced into evidence for the purpose of enhancing Appellant's sentence, it failed to do so regarding the tenth image, notwithstanding its opportunity and legal burden to do so. An inference was thus raised that the government was unable to prove this element as to that tenth image. This inference was never overcome by competent evidence to the contrary, and thus the basis for the attempted sentencing enhancement fails. Third, given the state of scientific, technical, and specialized knowledge extant today in the digital reproduction of photographic images, the district judge was independently unqualified to reach a valid conclusion regarding whether the tenth image represented a real person. Because there was no proper evidentiary foundation presented as to the tenth image, the district court could not independently find a crucial fact, <i>i.e.,</i> that the image was of a real person. Thus, the government failed to meet its burden in this respect and the district court erroneously applied the sentencing enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>The Initial Proceedings</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A Superseding Indictment charged Appellant with a single count of possessing prohibited visual depictions in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252(a)(4)(B).

Dr. Vorder Bruegge also conducts research in his field of expertise, provides instruction to others in law enforcement and forensic science, and serves on internal and external committees developing guidelines for the use of images in law enforcement. <i>Id.</i> at 4-6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Vorder Bruegge received his formal training at Brown University, where he earned a bachelor of science degree in engineering, and thereafter a master of science degree and a doctorate in geological sciences. Ten years ago he entered a two-year training program within the FBI laboratory designed to train examiners of questioned photographic evidence. The training included instruction in basic photography, laboratory photography, and forensic photography; courses at the Rochester Institute of Technology in digital imaging, digital image processing, and the use of Adobe Photoshop, a software tool, in an engineering or technical environment; video training at the Sony Institute; and training in the use of a forensic platform called Avid. The FBI also hired Professor Peter Ratner from James Madison University, who \"<i>runs a program that is geared at creating computer-generated people</i> and creating computer-generated animations, ... [to] come in and teach a one-week class on how one goes about creating 3-D people, as well as how one goes about seeing where the flaws are in 3-D computer-generated people so it's possible to discriminate between what is a computer-generated person and what is not.\" <i>Id.</i> at 6-7, 12 (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn21\" id=\"fn21_ref\">21</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The most important part of Dr. Vorder Bruegge's training, however, was on the job, working on cases while being supervised by a qualified senior examiner. About 30% of his everyday practice deals with image authentication, which for the most part involves child pornography cases. Dr. Vorder Bruegge has worked on over a dozen such cases, in connection with which he has reviewed more than 10,000 images. <i>Id.</i> at 7-9, 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Vorder Bruegge's expertise in this field has been recognized by his peers. He has been named a fellow of the American Academy of Forensic Sciences, which is the highest level of membership in the Academy and makes him eligible to be an official of the Academy. Dr. Vorder Bruegge is also a member of the International Association for Identification, and at the time served as chair of the scientific group of imaging technology (\"SWGIT\"). SWGIT is an organization of state, federal, and international law enforcement agencies, as well as members of academia, whose mission is the development of guidelines and best practices for the use of photography and imaging sciences in law enforcement. <i>See also</i> Scientific Working Group on Imaging Technology, International Association for Identification, http:// www.theiai.org/guidelines/swgit/index.php. Other relevant professional and scientific organizations to which Dr. Vorder Bruegge belongs include the American Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing, the International Society for Optical Engineering, the Tau Beta Pi engineering honor society, and the Sigma Xi honor society of research scientists. Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 7-8, Apr. 7, 2005.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based upon these qualifications, the court ruled that Dr. Vorder Bruegge was qualified as an expert under Rule 702 because his \"scientific, technical or other specialized knowledge will assist the [district judge] to understand evidence or determine a fact at issue.\" <i>Id.</i> at 18-19 (\"I find that this gentlemen has training and can use his past education. And by that, I mean his doctorate. Even in the field of his doctorate, he has experience in that he has 10,000 photographs evaluated. He seems to have skills, and he has acquired knowledge. So, therefore, the Court will admit him as an expert.\"). The district judge decided that given the posture of the case and the court's prior rulings, \"there is a fact in issue, and that is whether or not these are authentic, real images or whether they are virtual images ... [and thus] <i>scientific, technical or other specialized skill is needed.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> at 19 (emphasis added). It is important to note that this ruling was made immediately after, and in the context of, Dr. Vorder Bruegge's testimony that he had taken a course given by Professor Ratner on the creation of computer-generated virtual persons. <i>See supra</i> text accompanying note 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In authenticating an image, Dr. Vorder Bruegge testified, there is a \"sort of triage system in place.\" Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 9, Apr. 7, 2005. First, the expert determines if there are any known victims, individuals who have previously been identified in images, or if the image is from a known database, such as the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Reference File (\"CEORF\"), which is a database of images found in magazines that were published in the 1970s and 1980s. The CEORF was created by Dr. Vorder Bruegge's unit in the FBI. The expert's identification of a known victim or image serves the double purpose of identifying the victim and determining the approximate date when the image was created. If the image is of a person in the CEORF, it is possible to discount the possibility that it is not of a real person, as such technology did not become available until long after the time period covered by the CEORF. <i>Id.</i> at 9, 28-29. Two other important databases of known victims are the FBI's Child Victim Identification Program and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's related, but separately maintained, database. <i>Id.</i> at 28-30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the available databases are checked, if the image is not found therein, a scientific protocol has been established to determine whether the image is real, has been altered, or was computer-generated. Dr. Vorder Bruegge testified in detail regarding the methodology used in determining whether an image depicts a real person. The analysis comprises two parts: One involves determining whether the image depicts a real person, and the other, whether the image has been manipulated. <i>Id.</i> at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of whether an image has been manipulated is analyzed first. This is done by visual inspection. Computers enable Dr. Vorder Bruegge and others who do this work to inspect the images in a highly magnified manner for signs of manipulation. \"For example, if a head is cut off one picture and superimposed on another, there may be signs of that cutting and pasting operation and by analyzing the [magnified] image, it's possible to look for defects that would indicate this type of manipulation.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In looking for signs of manipulation, there are a number of features that the expert checks. These include making sure that the light in the scene is consistent; checking for differences in color within the scene;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> looking for consistency in the patterns in a scene, such as variations in the paneling of the walls in a courtroom; checking for variations in the texture or grain of the image &#8212; which are detected when the image is magnified &#8212; which would demonstrate that two different types of film were used; and comparing the focus, or depth of field, across an image. <i>Id.</i> at 20-22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, to determine whether there is a real person depicted in the image, the expert looks at the characteristics of the people in question. A computer-generated person created by a state-of-the-art computer today does not have totally realistic human features, as there are certain characteristics, such as the eyes and skin, that are difficult to recreate from scratch with a computer. <i>Id.</i> at 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The skin is a real problem because a great deal of detail is required to make it look real. Three dimensional animation only creates a static model, and as the character is moved to another position, to be realistic, it must be \"painted by hand.... Each picture, to be realistic, has to be hand altered. There is a checklist of skin features\" that the expert must consider in determining whether a person in an image is real or computer generated. <i>Id.</i> at 24-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another area that requires special attention in the determination of whether an image depicts a real person is that of the attachment of the limbs to the torso. With human beings, the attachment of the limbs to the torso occurs in a very supple way, which is very difficult to recreate on a computer. The expert therefore looks for \"crimps\" at the intersections where arms or legs meet the body as evidence that an image is a 3-D recreation. <i>Id.</i> at 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The expert also looks for \"defects like moles, freckles, scars, even the fine wrinkles in the mouth [and] ears. Ears are something that computer artists have an incredibly hard time getting right because they think that an ear is just something that you slap on the side of the head, but an ear actually has a lot of detail to it and it can move[;] ... it can shift as you are talking....\" <i>Id.</i> at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">How individuals in a picture interact with one another and their environment is also \"very critical in assessing the reality of the image.\" <i>Id.</i> This is reflected in a number of ways, including whether shadows realistically fall across the body of another person depicted, such that it is \"[n]ot just a shadow painted on a two-dimensional object but the shadow has to conform to the three-dimensional nature of the person or the environment behind it.\" <i>Id.</i> As another example, \"if you have a person sitting on a couch or on a bed, the material underneath the person should react in a realistic fashion to the presence of that person.... You have to basically program gravity into it and that isn't something that is easy to do.\" <i>Id.</i> at 26-27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the expert methodology</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">consists of going through this checklist of all the things that make an image appear to be real and then make human beings appear to be real, and determining if there is any violation of those observations that would indicate that there is something wrong with the image and lead one to the conclusion that this is not an accurate image of a real person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 27-28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Vorder Bruegge further testified that if there are multiple images of one person of \"sufficient quality, then based on the fact that there are many images of the same person, the quality exceeds that possibility to create in an artificial manner, then we will conclude that it is a real person.\" <i>Id.</i> at 31. However, \"if we have only a single image, we do not ... positively conclude that that [sic] is a real person <i>because the state-of-the-art of image processing is such that someone ... with a sufficient, significant amount of skill, time and willingness to spend the time can create a perfect fake image &#8212; it is possible that someone could create one single fake image</i> ....\" <i>Id.</i> at 30-31 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to following an established methodology, Dr. Vorder Bruegge's reports regarding authentication of images are subject to peer review. Every report that is written in Dr. Vorder Bruegge's laboratory \"must be peer reviewed and a second qualified examiner must sign off on the conclusions and report,\" thus validating the reports by agreeing that the evidence supports the conclusions therein. <i>Id.</i> at 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After obtaining testimony regarding standard methodology, the government proceeded to elicit Dr. Vorder Bruegge's expert opinion regarding the images depicted in Government's Exhibits 5 through 17, all of which he had examined on a prior occasion and which had been duly identified with his initials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Vorder Bruegge testified that in his expert opinion <i>Exhibit 5</i> depicts a real child. <i>Id.</i> at 38-39; Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 7-8, Apr. 8, 2005. He reached this conclusion based on the high degree of detail in the picture, as well as the fact that there are other pictures of this individual. Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 8, Apr. 8, 2005.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to <i>Exhibits 6, 7, 8, and 9,</i> Dr. Vorder Bruegge's opinion that the images depict real children was based in part on the fact that the same individuals and scenes are depicted in magazines known to have been published prior to April 1986. His conclusion also depended on his expert examination of the quality and level of detail in the images, and that there are multiple pictures depicting the same individuals and scenes. <i>Id.</i> at 9-11, 16-17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Exhibit 10,</i> which Appellant had already admitted as representing an image of a real child as part of his change of plea colloquy, was nonetheless testified to by Dr. Vorder Bruegge as representing, in his expert opinion, a real person and events. <i>Id.</i> at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Vorder Bruegge next testified regarding Exhibits 11 through 15, stating generally that \"it is [his] opinion that these pictures all depict real people and events.\" <i>Id.</i> at 20. He was then individually quizzed as to each of these images: <i>Exhibit 11, id.</i> at 23 (agreeing \"that the image depicts real people with real events\"); <i>Exhibit 12, id.</i> (same); <i>Exhibit 13, id.</i> at 23-24 (same); <i>Exhibit 14, id.</i> at 24 (same); and <i>Exhibit 15, id.</i> (same). Dr. Vorder Bruegge alternatively based his opinion regarding Exhibits 11 through 15 on the fact that they were all part of the \"Helen series\" in one of the databases, <i>id.</i> at 25-26, and that \"they are high quality images with a lot of detail and there are many of them. That is the basis, being able to look at those images and say, this is the same person and location and events, [that] enabled [Dr. Vorder Bruegge] to reach the opinion that they are real.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The government then jumped to Exhibit 17,</i> proceeding to question Dr. Vorder Bruegge regarding this image in the same manner as it had regarding Exhibits 5 through 15, and establishing that of the two persons depicted in the image, the girl laying below depicted a real person, but the individual above her had been manipulated in some way. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>No questions were asked of Dr. Vorder Bruegge by the government (nor anyone else) regarding Exhibit 16, and of course, neither did he testify that the image in said Exhibit 16 depicts a real person, and thus, the government was short one image to prove the enhancement sought against Appellant.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to point out that immediately before Dr. Vorder Bruegge was cross-examined by the defense, a discussion arose regarding the status of Exhibits 1 through 19, that is, whether they had been admitted into evidence, during which the following exchange took place:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: There is no admission as to the matter of being under age and having been real images.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[APPELLANT'S COUNSEL]: They're admitted in the sense that they were images taken from my client's computer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: For those purposes they have been admitted. For this matter [<i>i.e.,</i> the enhancement hearing], they have not been admitted....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: Except, of course, Exhibit No. 10[, which was part of the plea].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, there can be no question in anyone's mind that as to all these exhibits the government had tendered (that is, Exhibits 1 through 19, <i>including 16,</i> but except Exhibit 10), the government had the burden of establishing that the images depicted real persons. <i>At that point, of course, Dr. Vorder Bruegge was still available to the government, and in fact, was still on the stand, under oath, and the defense had not even commenced cross-examination.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Why</i> the government failed to ask their expert, Dr. Vorder Bruegge, whether or not the image depicted in Exhibit 16 represented a real person is <i>totally irrelevant. What is relevant</i> &#8212; the only sure, cold fact on the record &#8212; is that notwithstanding the fact that Dr. Vorder Bruegge was available to testify, that he had undisputably examined Exhibit 16 prior to taking the stand, and that he testified to exhaustion as to all of the other government exhibits, giving his expert opinion based on the methodology described at length above, <i>Dr. Vorder Bruegge did not speak when it came to Exhibit 16, the critical tenth image.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I shall presently discuss the legal consequences of the inference raised by this silence. Suffice it to say for the present that the negative inference that is raised against the government by its failure to inquire of Dr. Vorder Bruegge his opinion of the image in Exhibit 16 is compounded by the fact that even after the defense's cross-examination of Dr. Vorder Bruegge, the government had a second opportunity to ask Dr. Vorder Bruegge about this critical missing link when it engaged in redirect examination of him, <i>yet again failed to do so. Id.</i> at 43-44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's counsel conducted a tactically deliberate cross-examination of Dr. Vorder Bruegge, avoiding mention of Exhibit 16 like the plague. <i>Id.</i> at 31-43. He was, of course, perfectly entitled not to inquire about a subject not raised in direct examination and as to which the government had the burden of proof. <i>See Hilton II,</i> 386 F.3d at 18. He was also entitled to count on the district court not coming to the aid of the government, a subject which I shall cover in more detail presently. However, what is worth mentioning at this time is that not only did the government fail to inquire from Dr. Vorder Bruegge about Exhibit 16, but <i>the district court judge also did not at any time avail himself of Dr. Vorder Bruegge's expertise,</i> although obviously he had plenty of opportunity to do so before the expert was excused after a friendly farewell. <i>See</i> Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 45-56, Apr. 8, 2005.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In actual sequence, Dr. Jaunarena's testimony followed that of Dr. Vorder Bruegge, with his taking the stand on April 8, 2005, and finalizing his testimony on April 13, 2005. Before resting its case, the government recalled H&#233;ctor X.

We need not discuss his testimony further as it is not relevant to the issue of this appeal. Suffice it to say that eventually the government rested its case without presenting any evidence that Exhibit 16 depicted a real person. <i>See</i> Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 12-13, Apr. 20, 2005.

All went well for the government as to Exhibits 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. <i>Id.</i> at 10-18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two problems arose, however, the first with Exhibit 9 and the second with Exhibit 16.

Although Dr. Vorder Bruegge testified that this exhibit was an image reflecting real people and real events, this exhibit was not shown to Dr. Jaunarena. <i>Id.</i> at 13-15. That being the case, the district judge concluded that \"for the time being\" he would make no determination as to the age of the person. <i>Id.</i> at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But later on, the district judge stated with respect to Exhibit 9: \"[Dr. Jaunarena] jumped 9. The Court will [therefore] not make a finding as to this one. I have doubts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 23. The judge then went on to say: \"So notwithstanding, I have 10 real images, and one prepubescent age. [The][t]en real images are 6, 7 and 8. That's three. 10, [four]; 11, [five]; 12, [six]; 13, [seven]; 14, [eight]; 15, nine; and <i>16, [ten].</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added).

The opposite was the case with respect to Exhibit 16: Dr. Vorder Bruegge, although he examined Exhibit 9, subjected it to his expert methodology, and gave his opinion regarding its contents, gave no evidence as to the crucial Exhibit 16, notwithstanding having examined it in accordance with established scientific methodology, and additionally, notwithstanding his being within the control of the government as its full-time employee. Of course, since he did not testify on the question of the reality of the image depicted in Exhibit 16, he was not subjected to the crucible of cross-examination, or even to questioning by the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel for Appellant made the best of what was obviously a bad situation for his client, the district court having made an apparent mid-course change based on its interpretation of the law.

That the children in the images are real amounts to an element of the crime which the government must prove, the burden of which should not be displaced to the defendant as an affirmative defense.\"). Appellant was not required to prove or even raise the reality issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only did the district court inappropriately shift the burden, but it also lulled the defense into believing that the burden was fully on the government to prove by expert testimony that ten images were real. The defendant based his defense strategy on that belief. But on the last day of the sentencing hearing, as described above, the district court suddenly switched gears, permitting itself as the factfinder to make its own determination without any expert help.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the district court's error in failing to place due weight on the government's burden was compounded in this case because Dr. Vorder Bruegge's failure or refusal to testify regarding the reality of Exhibit 16 raises an inference, unrebutted by competent evidence, that the reality of Exhibit 16 was in doubt. <i>See United States v. Charles,</i> 738 F.2d 686, 698 (5th Cir.1984) (\"In general, the failure to produce a favorable witness or other evidence when it is peculiarly within a party's power to do so creates an inference that the witness' testimony will be unfavorable.\"); <i>see also Graves v.

See West,</i> 393 F.3d at 1309.

Unfortunately for the government, it is a trail that is not easily hidden and cannot be facilely bypassed, for it runs through, and has been noted in, high places, as well as places that are not so high.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p159\">\n      <span class=\"num\">159</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When before the Supreme Court in <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> arguing in favor of the constitutionality of the statutory provision that banned virtual pornographic reproductions of children as well as real images, the government contended that \"[<i>v]irtual images ... are indistinguishable from real ones</i> ...

We took note of the government's position on this very point when we decided <i>Hilton II.</i> 386 F.3d at 17 (\"The government's second argument [in <i>Free Speech Coalition</i>] was that eliminating actual child pornography necessitates the prohibition on virtual pornography because <i>virtual images are indistinguishable from real ones.</i>\" (emphasis added)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p160\">\n      <span class=\"num\">160</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That virtual and real child pornography images are indistinguishable, and that even experts have difficulty determining what is real and what is virtual, are not only undeniable scientific judgments promoted by the government in <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> and <i>Hilton II,</i> they are also conclusions which were unquestionably verified in the present case by the government's own actions, including the testimony of its own expert witness, Dr. Vorder Bruegge.

Hilton II,</i> 386 F.3d at 18-19 (rejecting the government's argument that it was \"commonsensical\" that because an expert pediatrician testified that the images depict minor children, this testimony was sufficient to establish the further element of reality). If an expert pediatrician is unqualified to render an opinion as to the reality of an image depicting children, how is it possible for a district judge to do so without any personal expertise on the subject, without the aid of expert opinion to help him reach a conclusion as to the reality of that photograph, and without the benefit of peer review?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p163\">\n      <span class=\"num\">163</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This was substantially what Appellant's lawyer argued to the district court:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p164\">\n      <span class=\"num\">164</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">You are quite an accomplished lawyer, but you are not an expert, the Court is not an expert on identification....

According to the testimony of the government's witness in the present case, Dr. Vorder Bruegge, the <i>Nolan</i> images could not have been anything but real &#8212; and therefore there was no need for expert testimony in that case &#8212; because it was not \"until long after\" the FBI created the CEORF database in 1986 that the technology became available to create a virtual image of a person.

As the government's conduct clearly establishes, as Dr. Vorder Bruegge's testimony strongly reinforces, and further, as both <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> and <i>Hilton II</i> recognize, determining whether an image is real or virtually created is not only no longer within the \"range of normal experience and knowledge\" of the average person, but it may also very well be \"difficult\" for even experts \"[to say] whether the pictures were made by using real children or by using computer imaging.\" <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 254, 122 S.Ct. 1389. Additionally, the Supreme Court was not just relying on the arguments of the parties in <i>Free Speech Coalition;</i> it specifically said that \"[t]he new technology, <i>according to Congress,</i> makes it possible to create realistic images of children who do not exist.\" <i>Id.</i> at 240, 122 S.Ct. 1389 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p177\">\n      <span class=\"num\">177</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fact is that <i>Nolan</i> is today scientifically unsound, and slavish insistence upon its outmoded dogma is the equivalent to insisting on a modern day Galileo conundrum.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn25\" id=\"fn25_ref\">25</a> The scientific evidence available today is overwhelmingly contrary to that which existed in <i>Nolan's</i> day, and in the present case, it is clearly established by the uncontradicted testimony of the government's own expert witness, Dr. Vorder Bruegge, Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 12, 30-31 Apr. 7, 2005 (testifying about a course the expert took at the FBI laboratory taught by Professor Peter Ratner, who runs a program at James Madison University on creating computer-generated people, and also testifying that \"the state-of-the-art of image processing is such that someone ... with a sufficient, significant amount of skill, time and willingness to spend the time can create a perfect fake image.\"), as well by the pronouncements of <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> and <i>Hilton II. There is simply no question that today it is possible to create virtual images of humans that are indistinguishable from the real thing.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p178\">\n      <span class=\"num\">178</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, <i>Nolan's</i> ruling that the government need not call a photography expert \"to negate the mere speculative possibility of such fakery,\" 818 F.2d at 1018-19, cannot stand against the present record. First of all, Nolan conceded that the pictures were \"on their face, representations of what looked like minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1017. That is not the present case. Here, counsel for Appellant refused to allow his client to be boxed in to such an unwarranted predicament. In entering a straight plea to the Superseding Indictment, Appellant <i>only</i> admitted to possessing <i>one</i> photograph whose \"depictions represent a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct\" &#8212; he contested \"everything else.\" Exhibit 16 was, of course, not the one admitted to by Appellant. Thus, contrary to what the court in <i>Nolan</i> expected of that defendant, <i>id.</i> at 1020 n. 4 (\"The defense produced no expert of its own to show that the pictures were fakes or other than what they appeared to be.\"), under the present state of the law, \"[a]fter <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> the government must prove that an image depicts actual children[,] ... [and] the government is not released from its burden of proof by a defendant's failure to argue, or by an absence of evidence otherwise suggesting, the artificiality of the children portrayed. That the children in the images are real amounts to an element of the crime which the government must prove, the burden of which should not be displaced to the defendant as an affirmative defense.\" <i>Hilton II,</i> 386 F.3d at 18 (citing <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 256, 122 S.Ct. 1389). In this the government failed and the district court was unwarranted in filling the gap.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p179\">\n      <span class=\"num\">179</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the legal and scientific underpinnings of <i>Nolan</i> are no longer with us, we should allow that case to rest in peace without further ado. <i>See V&#225;squez v.

Rather, its lesson is that every successful proponent of overruling precedent has borne the heavy burden of persuading the Court that changes in society or in the law dictate that the values served by <i>stare decisis</i> yield in favor of a greater objective.\"). I believe this is an occasion like that in <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26 v.

He did not agree, however, that he possessed at least ten images of minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct, which would enhance his guidelines sentencing range under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2G2.4(b)(2) (2002). The court accepted defendant's guilty plea and stated that it would address the enhancement issue at sentencing. Defendant waived jury determination of the disputed sentencing enhancements. At that time, the government indicated it had expert reports to support its position on guilt and sentencing. The government had prepared its case under what was then this circuit's rule, short-lived and later withdrawn, that the government was obligated to produce an expert opinion as to reality, even in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, in order to meet its burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>United States v.

The government offered evidence on a sample of the 234 pornographic images taken from defendant's computer.

The parties agree that the prosecution did not ask Dr. Vorder Bruegge his opinion as to whether Exhibit 16 was of an actual person.

The district court found that the image in Exhibit 16 portrayed sexually explicit conduct and was of an actual child. The court imposed the two-level guidelines increase, based on its own review of the image, the expert testimony of Dr. Jaunarena-Perez that the image was of a minor, and its use of Dr. Vorder Bruegge's testimony as to the methodology for distinguishing between real and virtual images; the court also noted the absence of any testimony that the images were not of actual children, to counter this evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, under the post-<i>Booker</i> advisory guidelines system, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

But defendant and the dissent insufficiently appreciate language in <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> that refers to the continuing use of real children:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If virtual images were identical to illegal child pornography, the illegal images would be driven from the market by the indistinguishable substitutes.

There is no basis to assume that the producers of child pornography have widely converted to exclusive use of virtual pornography. Even before <i>Free Speech Coalition, Nolan</i> made the point that, given the proliferation and sheer number of the pornographic images available, common sense strongly suggests that many of the images on the market are of real children. 818 F.2d at 1018.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there any reason to think that the exploitation of real children to produce pornography has ceased. We know as a matter of fact that the market continues using real children to produce pornography because the cases, including this one, continue to have in them direct evidence that a real child was used. <i>See, e.g., Frabizio,</i> 459 F.3d at 82 &amp; n. 3; <i>United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"77432\"><a href=\"/opinion/77432/united-states-v-alvin-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">459</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1276</span></a></span>, 1287 (11th Cir. 2006); <i>United States v. Mack,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794777\"><a href=\"/opinion/794777/united-states-v-archie-alexander-mack/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">744</span></a></span>, 745 (8th Cir.2006). In this case, multiple images taken from defendant's computer were identified as depicting real children, after comparing the images to those compiled in the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Reference File and the database maintained by the FBI's Child Victim Identification Program. Defendant himself admitted that one of the images was of a real child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor is there any reason to assume that particular images on which a prosecution is based have been produced by such superior technology. In this case, for example, certain of the images had been published in magazines from the 1970s or 1980s, well before there was the capacity to do any realistic form of virtual imaging.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burden of proof remains on the government to prove the pornographic image is of a real child. The overarching legal point is the holding stated in <i>Nolan:</i> \"[T]he prosecution was not required, as part of its affirmative case, to rule out every conceivable way the pictures could have been made other than by ordinary photography.\" 818 F.2d at 1020; <i>see also United States v. Smith,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"405061\"><a href=\"/opinion/405061/united-states-v-john-m-smith/\"><span class=\"volume\">680</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>, 259 (1st Cir.1982) (\"The Government ... need not exclude every reasonable hypothesis of innocence, provided the record as a whole supports a conclusion of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"); 26 J. Moore et al., <i>Moore's Federal Practice</i> &#167; 629.05[2] (3d ed. 2006) (\"Proof beyond a reasonable doubt does not require that the government adduce evidence excluding all reasonable defense theories, thereby leaving only the conclusion of guilt independently proved.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We should not be misunderstood: the government at all times has the burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence at sentencing, and the defendant has no burden. There is nothing inconsistent between the government's having that burden and <i>Nolan's</i> statement that the defendant, while under no obligation to do so, was \"free to have presented evidence of his own suggesting that the picture[] used other than real subjects. He could have called an expert to testify as to how photographs like [this one] could have been made without using real children.\" <i>Nolan,</i> 818 F.2d at 1020. If defendant had chosen to mount a defense of this type and presented such expert testimony, and had the government not called an expert to explain why the image was real, the government ran the risk of not persuading the trier of fact. This does not shift the burden of proof. The evaluation of the sufficiency of the evidence is done on the record as a whole, not on \"bright line\" tests such as the one defendant advances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Unpreserved Arguments Made by the Dissent</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent injects new arguments into the case which were not raised by Rodriguez-Pacheco in the district court or on appeal. As such, the arguments have been waived. <i>See United States v. Gobbi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202578\"><a href=\"/opinion/202578/united-states-v-gobbi/\"><span class=\"volume\">471</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">302</span></a></span>, 312 n. 4 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent first makes the novel argument that the proceedings below were unfair and so the defendant was sandbagged. Defendant never made this argument at any time. If defendant thought there was procedural unfairness, he would have said so. The dissent's procedural unfairness argument is without merit in any event. The argument seems to be that defendant came to expect there would be an expert opinion on each of the ten images, and his disappointed expectations mean the case should be remanded. The argument, which has other deficiencies, ignores the fact that when the government prepared the case, the panel opinion in <i>Hilton I</i> required expert testimony, and so the case proceeded on that basis. Before the expert gave his testimony, the law had changed, the rule in <i>Hilton I</i> had been withdrawn, and the defense was well aware of the change. Defendant knew from the outset of the sentencing hearing that the government would present an expert on the reality of the images. Yet he chose not to introduce his own expert, or offer any evidence of his own that the images were not of real children. Further, the district court's reference to \"scientific, technical or other specialized skill\" to help it determine the reality of children depicted in the prosecution's exhibits came when it explained its reasons for admitting Dr. Vorder Bruegge as an expert witness, over defense counsel's objection. That could not have misled defendant.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent next makes the novel argument that it was error for the district court not to sua sponte infer from the government's failure to ask Dr. Vorder Bruegge for his opinion on Exhibit 16, that he would have said, if asked, that the image was not of a real child. The defense did not ask for such an inference;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> its argument was that, whatever the government's reasons for not questioning the expert on Exhibit 16, only an expert, not a court or even a jury as factfinder, could make that determination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The dissent also gains no support from cases in which adverse inferences are requested and drawn, based on a party's failure to produce a witness at all. <i>See, e.g., Olszewski v. Spencer,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">47</span></span>, 61 (1st Cir.2006). Here, there was no failure to produce a witness, only a failure to ask a particular question from a produced witness. Further, no inference can be drawn, contrary to the dissent, from the district court's failure to take over the examination of the witness when Exhibit 16 was not raised during questioning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the dissent makes another argument which was not made by defendant on appeal. Defendant's argument on appeal is that the law requires the government to produce the opinion of an expert that an image is of a real child, and, since no such opinion was offered, <i>therefore</i> the evidence was insufficient, regardless of the other evidence. We have rejected that legal proposition. The dissent makes a different argument that the remaining evidence was insufficient as a matter of evidence. The dissent confuses the role of the expert with the district court's role as factfinder. That argument is also waived. Nonetheless, we discuss why the argument fails.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government met its burden of proof by a preponderance of the evidence. The district court as finder of fact was entitled to use Dr. Vorder Bruegge's testimony about criteria relevant to determining whether an image is real to assist it in making its own determination concerning Exhibit 16. The expert testified that computer-generated images have difficulty recreating the characteristics of human eyes and skin. He also stressed the importance of evaluating how individuals in an image interact with one another and their environment&#8212;factors to consider included shadows, gravity, and the effect of pressure on a human body. The expert also evaluated flesh and muscle tone on human images. The district court judge adopted Dr. Vorder Bruegge's methodology, making clear that his conclusion as to the reality of the child in Exhibit 16 was \"[b]ased on the testimony that [the expert] provided as to all of the other photographs [and] the criteria that he was using.\" Further, the judge \"conclude[d] that the skin, that the tonation of the muscles, that both hands on the thighs of the male impress the Court that this is not a virtual image but it is a real image.\" The district court made these findings, applying Dr. Vorder Bruegge's methodology. That is sufficient. The district court had sufficient evidence, and no evidence to the contrary,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> to conclude that Exhibit 16 depicted a real child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having addressed the dissent's additional arguments, we note that defendant himself does not otherwise challenge the court's finding that the tenth image is of a real child.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentence is <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On appeal, defendant does not dispute the court's finding that one of the images is of a prepubescent minor or a child under the age of twelve.

Thus appellant has not received all the process that is due to him. Because my colleagues in the majority have concluded otherwise, I am compelled to respectfully dissent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Succinctly put, for the sentencing enhancement established in U.S.S.G. &#167; 2G2.4(b)(2) (2002) to be validly applied by the district court in this case, the government had to establish that Appellant David Rodr&#237;guez-Pacheco (\"Appellant\") possessed at least ten proscribed images. The government only properly proved that he possessed nine images of actual, real minors. Unfortunately, after the close of the evidence, the district judge erroneously proceeded to provide the missing link by concluding, without adequate foundation in the evidence, that there was a tenth image of an actual person. Because there was no such tenth image established by adequate proof, in my opinion, we have no alternative but to disallow the resulting sentence, and to remand the case for appropriate sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As will be shown hereinafter, the district court committed three pivotal errors, related in nature, but distinct in factual and legal significance. Individually and collectively these errors inevitably lead to the outcome I suggest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, if we consider the district court's rulings throughout most of the sentencing process, Appellant was led to believe that the government would need to prove the reality of the persons depicted for all of the images introduced to prove the sentencing enhancement. The court's last minute change of course, whereby it effectively relieved the government of its burden, was not only a legally incorrect shifting of the burden that properly belongs to the government, <i>see Hilton II,</i> 386 F.3d at 18, but it also left Appellant high and dry at a point in the proceedings when it was most tactically disadvantageous. Second, although the government presented competent evidence regarding the reality of nine of the ten images introduced into evidence for the purpose of enhancing Appellant's sentence, it failed to do so regarding the tenth image, notwithstanding its opportunity and legal burden to do so. An inference was thus raised that the government was unable to prove this element as to that tenth image. This inference was never overcome by competent evidence to the contrary, and thus the basis for the attempted sentencing enhancement fails. Third, given the state of scientific, technical, and specialized knowledge extant today in the digital reproduction of photographic images, the district judge was independently unqualified to reach a valid conclusion regarding whether the tenth image represented a real person. Because there was no proper evidentiary foundation presented as to the tenth image, the district court could not independently find a crucial fact, <i>i.e.,</i> that the image was of a real person. Thus, the government failed to meet its burden in this respect and the district court erroneously applied the sentencing enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>The Initial Proceedings</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A Superseding Indictment charged Appellant with a single count of possessing prohibited visual depictions in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252(a)(4)(B).

It is important to note that this ruling was made immediately after, and in the context of, Dr. Vorder Bruegge's testimony that he had taken a course given by Professor Ratner on the creation of computer-generated virtual persons. <i>See supra</i> text accompanying note 10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In authenticating an image, Dr. Vorder Bruegge testified, there is a \"sort of triage system in place.\" Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 9, Apr. 7, 2005. First, the expert determines if there are any known victims, individuals who have previously been identified in images, or if the image is from a known database, such as the Child Exploitation and Obscenity Reference File (\"CEORF\"), which is a database of images found in magazines that were published in the 1970s and 1980s. The CEORF was created by Dr. Vorder Bruegge's unit in the FBI. The expert's identification of a known victim or image serves the double purpose of identifying the victim and determining the approximate date when the image was created. If the image is of a person in the CEORF, it is possible to discount the possibility that it is not of a real person, as such technology did not become available until long after the time period covered by the CEORF. <i>Id.</i> at 9, 28-29. Two other important databases of known victims are the FBI's Child Victim Identification Program and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children's related, but separately maintained, database. <i>Id.</i> at 28-30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the available databases are checked, if the image is not found therein, a scientific protocol has been established to determine whether the image is real, has been altered, or was computer-generated. Dr. Vorder Bruegge testified in detail regarding the methodology used in determining whether an image depicts a real person. The analysis comprises two parts: One involves determining whether the image depicts a real person, and the other, whether the image has been manipulated. <i>Id.</i> at 20.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of whether an image has been manipulated is analyzed first. This is done by visual inspection. Computers enable Dr. Vorder Bruegge and others who do this work to inspect the images in a highly magnified manner for signs of manipulation. \"For example, if a head is cut off one picture and superimposed on another, there may be signs of that cutting and pasting operation and by analyzing the [magnified] image, it's possible to look for defects that would indicate this type of manipulation.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In looking for signs of manipulation, there are a number of features that the expert checks. These include making sure that the light in the scene is consistent; checking for differences in color within the scene;<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn22\" id=\"fn22_ref\">22</a> looking for consistency in the patterns in a scene, such as variations in the paneling of the walls in a courtroom; checking for variations in the texture or grain of the image &#8212; which are detected when the image is magnified &#8212; which would demonstrate that two different types of film were used; and comparing the focus, or depth of field, across an image. <i>Id.</i> at 20-22.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, to determine whether there is a real person depicted in the image, the expert looks at the characteristics of the people in question. A computer-generated person created by a state-of-the-art computer today does not have totally realistic human features, as there are certain characteristics, such as the eyes and skin, that are difficult to recreate from scratch with a computer. <i>Id.</i> at 23.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The skin is a real problem because a great deal of detail is required to make it look real. Three dimensional animation only creates a static model, and as the character is moved to another position, to be realistic, it must be \"painted by hand.... Each picture, to be realistic, has to be hand altered. There is a checklist of skin features\" that the expert must consider in determining whether a person in an image is real or computer generated. <i>Id.</i> at 24-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another area that requires special attention in the determination of whether an image depicts a real person is that of the attachment of the limbs to the torso. With human beings, the attachment of the limbs to the torso occurs in a very supple way, which is very difficult to recreate on a computer. The expert therefore looks for \"crimps\" at the intersections where arms or legs meet the body as evidence that an image is a 3-D recreation. <i>Id.</i> at 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The expert also looks for \"defects like moles, freckles, scars, even the fine wrinkles in the mouth [and] ears. Ears are something that computer artists have an incredibly hard time getting right because they think that an ear is just something that you slap on the side of the head, but an ear actually has a lot of detail to it and it can move[;] ... it can shift as you are talking....\" <i>Id.</i> at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">How individuals in a picture interact with one another and their environment is also \"very critical in assessing the reality of the image.\" <i>Id.</i> This is reflected in a number of ways, including whether shadows realistically fall across the body of another person depicted, such that it is \"[n]ot just a shadow painted on a two-dimensional object but the shadow has to conform to the three-dimensional nature of the person or the environment behind it.\" <i>Id.</i> As another example, \"if you have a person sitting on a couch or on a bed, the material underneath the person should react in a realistic fashion to the presence of that person.... You have to basically program gravity into it and that isn't something that is easy to do.\" <i>Id.</i> at 26-27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the expert methodology</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">consists of going through this checklist of all the things that make an image appear to be real and then make human beings appear to be real, and determining if there is any violation of those observations that would indicate that there is something wrong with the image and lead one to the conclusion that this is not an accurate image of a real person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 27-28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Vorder Bruegge further testified that if there are multiple images of one person of \"sufficient quality, then based on the fact that there are many images of the same person, the quality exceeds that possibility to create in an artificial manner, then we will conclude that it is a real person.\" <i>Id.</i> at 31. However, \"if we have only a single image, we do not ... positively conclude that that [sic] is a real person <i>because the state-of-the-art of image processing is such that someone ... with a sufficient, significant amount of skill, time and willingness to spend the time can create a perfect fake image &#8212; it is possible that someone could create one single fake image</i> ....\" <i>Id.</i> at 30-31 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to following an established methodology, Dr. Vorder Bruegge's reports regarding authentication of images are subject to peer review. Every report that is written in Dr. Vorder Bruegge's laboratory \"must be peer reviewed and a second qualified examiner must sign off on the conclusions and report,\" thus validating the reports by agreeing that the evidence supports the conclusions therein. <i>Id.</i> at 33.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After obtaining testimony regarding standard methodology, the government proceeded to elicit Dr. Vorder Bruegge's expert opinion regarding the images depicted in Government's Exhibits 5 through 17, all of which he had examined on a prior occasion and which had been duly identified with his initials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Vorder Bruegge testified that in his expert opinion <i>Exhibit 5</i> depicts a real child. <i>Id.</i> at 38-39; Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 7-8, Apr. 8, 2005. He reached this conclusion based on the high degree of detail in the picture, as well as the fact that there are other pictures of this individual. Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 8, Apr. 8, 2005.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to <i>Exhibits 6, 7, 8, and 9,</i> Dr. Vorder Bruegge's opinion that the images depict real children was based in part on the fact that the same individuals and scenes are depicted in magazines known to have been published prior to April 1986. His conclusion also depended on his expert examination of the quality and level of detail in the images, and that there are multiple pictures depicting the same individuals and scenes. <i>Id.</i> at 9-11, 16-17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Exhibit 10,</i> which Appellant had already admitted as representing an image of a real child as part of his change of plea colloquy, was nonetheless testified to by Dr. Vorder Bruegge as representing, in his expert opinion, a real person and events. <i>Id.</i> at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Vorder Bruegge next testified regarding Exhibits 11 through 15, stating generally that \"it is [his] opinion that these pictures all depict real people and events.\" <i>Id.</i> at 20. He was then individually quizzed as to each of these images: <i>Exhibit 11, id.</i> at 23 (agreeing \"that the image depicts real people with real events\"); <i>Exhibit 12, id.</i> (same); <i>Exhibit 13, id.</i> at 23-24 (same); <i>Exhibit 14, id.</i> at 24 (same); and <i>Exhibit 15, id.</i> (same). Dr. Vorder Bruegge alternatively based his opinion regarding Exhibits 11 through 15 on the fact that they were all part of the \"Helen series\" in one of the databases, <i>id.</i> at 25-26, and that \"they are high quality images with a lot of detail and there are many of them. That is the basis, being able to look at those images and say, this is the same person and location and events, [that] enabled [Dr. Vorder Bruegge] to reach the opinion that they are real.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>The government then jumped to Exhibit 17,</i> proceeding to question Dr. Vorder Bruegge regarding this image in the same manner as it had regarding Exhibits 5 through 15, and establishing that of the two persons depicted in the image, the girl laying below depicted a real person, but the individual above her had been manipulated in some way. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>No questions were asked of Dr. Vorder Bruegge by the government (nor anyone else) regarding Exhibit 16, and of course, neither did he testify that the image in said Exhibit 16 depicts a real person, and thus, the government was short one image to prove the enhancement sought against Appellant.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is important to point out that immediately before Dr. Vorder Bruegge was cross-examined by the defense, a discussion arose regarding the status of Exhibits 1 through 19, that is, whether they had been admitted into evidence, during which the following exchange took place:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: There is no admission as to the matter of being under age and having been real images.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[APPELLANT'S COUNSEL]: They're admitted in the sense that they were images taken from my client's computer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">THE COURT: For those purposes they have been admitted. For this matter [<i>i.e.,</i> the enhancement hearing], they have not been admitted....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[GOVERNMENT COUNSEL]: Except, of course, Exhibit No. 10[, which was part of the plea].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 29.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, there can be no question in anyone's mind that as to all these exhibits the government had tendered (that is, Exhibits 1 through 19, <i>including 16,</i> but except Exhibit 10), the government had the burden of establishing that the images depicted real persons. <i>At that point, of course, Dr. Vorder Bruegge was still available to the government, and in fact, was still on the stand, under oath, and the defense had not even commenced cross-examination.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p106\">\n      <span class=\"num\">106</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Why</i> the government failed to ask their expert, Dr. Vorder Bruegge, whether or not the image depicted in Exhibit 16 represented a real person is <i>totally irrelevant. What is relevant</i> &#8212; the only sure, cold fact on the record &#8212; is that notwithstanding the fact that Dr. Vorder Bruegge was available to testify, that he had undisputably examined Exhibit 16 prior to taking the stand, and that he testified to exhaustion as to all of the other government exhibits, giving his expert opinion based on the methodology described at length above, <i>Dr. Vorder Bruegge did not speak when it came to Exhibit 16, the critical tenth image.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p107\">\n      <span class=\"num\">107</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I shall presently discuss the legal consequences of the inference raised by this silence. Suffice it to say for the present that the negative inference that is raised against the government by its failure to inquire of Dr. Vorder Bruegge his opinion of the image in Exhibit 16 is compounded by the fact that even after the defense's cross-examination of Dr. Vorder Bruegge, the government had a second opportunity to ask Dr. Vorder Bruegge about this critical missing link when it engaged in redirect examination of him, <i>yet again failed to do so. Id.</i> at 43-44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p108\">\n      <span class=\"num\">108</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's counsel conducted a tactically deliberate cross-examination of Dr. Vorder Bruegge, avoiding mention of Exhibit 16 like the plague. <i>Id.</i> at 31-43. He was, of course, perfectly entitled not to inquire about a subject not raised in direct examination and as to which the government had the burden of proof. <i>See Hilton II,</i> 386 F.3d at 18. He was also entitled to count on the district court not coming to the aid of the government, a subject which I shall cover in more detail presently. However, what is worth mentioning at this time is that not only did the government fail to inquire from Dr. Vorder Bruegge about Exhibit 16, but <i>the district court judge also did not at any time avail himself of Dr. Vorder Bruegge's expertise,</i> although obviously he had plenty of opportunity to do so before the expert was excused after a friendly farewell. <i>See</i> Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 45-56, Apr. 8, 2005.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p109\">\n      <span class=\"num\">109</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In actual sequence, Dr. Jaunarena's testimony followed that of Dr. Vorder Bruegge, with his taking the stand on April 8, 2005, and finalizing his testimony on April 13, 2005. Before resting its case, the government recalled H&#233;ctor X. Col&#243;n, an FBI agent that had testified on direct examination back on September 29, 2004 regarding retrieval of the images from Appellant's computer, <i>see</i> Evidentiary Hr'g Tr. 2, Sept. 29, 2004, to allow him to be cross-examined by Appellant, <i>see</i> Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 57-58, Apr. 8, 2005. We need not discuss his testimony further as it is not relevant to the issue of this appeal. Suffice it to say that eventually the government rested its case without presenting any evidence that Exhibit 16 depicted a real person. <i>See</i> Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 12-13, Apr. 20, 2005.

All went well for the government as to Exhibits 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and 15. <i>Id.</i> at 10-18.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p137\">\n      <span class=\"num\">137</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two problems arose, however, the first with Exhibit 9 and the second with Exhibit 16. The government needed at least one of these two to go into evidence to meet the minimum ten images required for the sentencing enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p138\">\n      <span class=\"num\">138</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government ran into problems with Exhibit 9 early on. Although Dr. Vorder Bruegge testified that this exhibit was an image reflecting real people and real events, this exhibit was not shown to Dr. Jaunarena. <i>Id.</i> at 13-15. That being the case, the district judge concluded that \"for the time being\" he would make no determination as to the age of the person. <i>Id.</i> at 14.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p139\">\n      <span class=\"num\">139</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But later on, the district judge stated with respect to Exhibit 9: \"[Dr. Jaunarena] jumped 9. The Court will [therefore] not make a finding as to this one. I have doubts.\" <i>Id.</i> at 23. The judge then went on to say: \"So notwithstanding, I have 10 real images, and one prepubescent age. [The][t]en real images are 6, 7 and 8. That's three. 10, [four]; 11, [five]; 12, [six]; 13, [seven]; 14, [eight]; 15, nine; and <i>16, [ten].</i>\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). The trouble with this arithmetic is, of course, that Exhibit 16 suffered from the same defect as Exhibit 9, except in the inverse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p140\">\n      <span class=\"num\">140</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Jaunarena had examined Exhibit 16, given his expert opinion, and been subject to cross examination regarding Exhibit 16, but not regarding Exhibit 9, which was thus excluded. The opposite was the case with respect to Exhibit 16: Dr. Vorder Bruegge, although he examined Exhibit 9, subjected it to his expert methodology, and gave his opinion regarding its contents, gave no evidence as to the crucial Exhibit 16, notwithstanding having examined it in accordance with established scientific methodology, and additionally, notwithstanding his being within the control of the government as its full-time employee. Of course, since he did not testify on the question of the reality of the image depicted in Exhibit 16, he was not subjected to the crucible of cross-examination, or even to questioning by the court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p141\">\n      <span class=\"num\">141</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Counsel for Appellant made the best of what was obviously a bad situation for his client, the district court having made an apparent mid-course change based on its interpretation of the law.

That the children in the images are real amounts to an element of the crime which the government must prove, the burden of which should not be displaced to the defendant as an affirmative defense.\"). Appellant was not required to prove or even raise the reality issue.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn24\" id=\"fn24_ref\">24</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p150\">\n      <span class=\"num\">150</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only did the district court inappropriately shift the burden, but it also lulled the defense into believing that the burden was fully on the government to prove by expert testimony that ten images were real. The defendant based his defense strategy on that belief. But on the last day of the sentencing hearing, as described above, the district court suddenly switched gears, permitting itself as the factfinder to make its own determination without any expert help.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p151\">\n      <span class=\"num\">151</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the district court's error in failing to place due weight on the government's burden was compounded in this case because Dr. Vorder Bruegge's failure or refusal to testify regarding the reality of Exhibit 16 raises an inference, unrebutted by competent evidence, that the reality of Exhibit 16 was in doubt. <i>See United States v.

According to the testimony of the government's witness in the present case, Dr. Vorder Bruegge, the <i>Nolan</i> images could not have been anything but real &#8212; and therefore there was no need for expert testimony in that case &#8212; because it was not \"until long after\" the FBI created the CEORF database in 1986 that the technology became available to create a virtual image of a person. Sentencing Hr'g Tr. 26, Apr. 7, 2005. Thus, the government's need for an expert witness to establish the reality of the images in <i>Nolan</i> is, by today's scientific standards, a non-issue. But there is more to this.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p176\">\n      <span class=\"num\">176</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We said in <i>Nolan</i> that \"the test for a factfinder's power to judge evidence without expert help is ... whether the subject is within the range of normal experience and knowledge.\" 818 F.2d at 1018. As the government's conduct clearly establishes, as Dr. Vorder Bruegge's testimony strongly reinforces, and further, as both <i>Free Speech Coalition</i> and <i>Hilton II</i> recognize, determining whether an image is real or virtually created is not only no longer within the \"range of normal experience and knowledge\" of the average person, but it may also very well be \"difficult\" for even experts \"[to say] whether the pictures were made by using real children or by using computer imaging.\" <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 254, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Additionally, the Supreme Court was not just relying on the arguments of the parties in <i>Free Speech Coalition;</i> it specifically said that \"[t]he new technology, <i>according to Congress,</i> makes it possible to create realistic images of children who do not exist.\" <i>Id.</i> at 240, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There is simply no question that today it is possible to create virtual images of humans that are indistinguishable from the real thing.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn26\" id=\"fn26_ref\">26</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p178\">\n      <span class=\"num\">178</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, <i>Nolan's</i> ruling that the government need not call a photography expert \"to negate the mere speculative possibility of such fakery,\" 818 F.2d at 1018-19, cannot stand against the present record. First of all, Nolan conceded that the pictures were \"on their face, representations of what looked like minors engaging in sexually explicit conduct.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1017. That is not the present case. Here, counsel for Appellant refused to allow his client to be boxed in to such an unwarranted predicament. In entering a straight plea to the Superseding Indictment, Appellant <i>only</i> admitted to possessing <i>one</i> photograph whose \"depictions represent a minor engaging in sexually explicit conduct\" &#8212; he contested \"everything else.\" Exhibit 16 was, of course, not the one admitted to by Appellant. Thus, contrary to what the court in <i>Nolan</i> expected of that defendant, <i>id.</i> at 1020 n. 4 (\"The defense produced no expert of its own to show that the pictures were fakes or other than what they appeared to be.\"), under the present state of the law, \"[a]fter <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> the government must prove that an image depicts actual children[,] ... [and] the government is not released from its burden of proof by a defendant's failure to argue, or by an absence of evidence otherwise suggesting, the artificiality of the children portrayed. That the children in the images are real amounts to an element of the crime which the government must prove, the burden of which should not be displaced to the defendant as an affirmative defense.\" <i>Hilton II,</i> 386 F.3d at 18 (citing <i>Free Speech Coalition,</i> 535 U.S. at 256, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118496\"><a href=\"/opinion/118496/ashcroft-v-free-speech-coalition/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
