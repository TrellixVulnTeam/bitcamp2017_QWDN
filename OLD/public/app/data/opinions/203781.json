Castille v. Peoples, 489 U.S.\n\n346, 351 (1989).           Melton argues that he first raised his Sixth\n\nAmendment right to counsel claim on non-discretionary review before\n\nthe Massachusetts Appeals Court. This argument fails.                     Melton’s\n\nbrief    before      the    Appeals    Court    mentioned   neither     the   Sixth\n\nAmendment nor the federal constitutional right to counsel.                       The\n\nbrief’s reference to a constitutional “right to closing argument”\n\ndid   not    present       Melton’s   Sixth     Amendment   claim     “face-up   and\n\nsquarely . . . .”          Martens v.

Melton\n\nwas no more explicit regarding his Sixth Amendment claim in oral\n\nargument before the Appeals Court than he was in his brief.                   He has\n\nfailed to exhaust the claim pursuant to § 2254(b).\n\nAFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f",
