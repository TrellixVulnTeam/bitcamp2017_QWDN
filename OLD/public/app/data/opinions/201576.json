This case is before us on\n\ninterlocutory cross-appeals pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1292(a)(1),1 as\n\na result of the district court's grant of a preliminary injunction\n\nunder the aegis of Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union, Local\n\n770, 398 U.S. 235 (1970) (finding jurisdiction to enjoin a labor\n\norganization from engaging in a work stoppage over a dispute\n\nsubject to arbitration under the governing collective bargaining\n\nagreement).\n\n                            I.   Background\n\n          Plaintiff-Appellant/Cross-Appellee Otis Elevator Company\n\n(\"Otis\") constructs and services elevators throughout the United\n\nStates, including in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine.         Otis\n\nemploys elevator mechanics, helpers and apprentices, all of whom\n\nare   represented   for   collective    bargaining   purposes   by    the\n\nInternational Union of Elevator Constructors (\"IUEC\") on behalf of\n\nits locals, including Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellant IUEC Local\n\n4 (\"Local 4\").2\n\n\n\n\n1\n   \"[C]ourts of appeal shall have jurisdiction of appeals from\n. . . [i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts of the United\nStates . . . granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or\ndissolving injunctions.\"\n2\n    Also appearing as Defendants-Appellees/Cross-Appellants are\nMichael Langer, Kevin McGettigan, and Steve Morse in their\nindividual and official capacities as officials of Local 4. The\nterm \"Local 4\" used herein includes the individually named\ndefendants in addition to the local union.\n\n                                  -2-\n\f            A.    The Collective Bargaining Agreement\n\n            On July 9, 2002, Otis and IUEC, on behalf of Local 4 and\n\nother local unions, entered into a five-year collective bargaining\n\nagreement (\"the Agreement\") that covers all of Otis' elevator\n\nemployees in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. The Agreement\n\ncontains three provisions central to the present appeals.\n\n            The first is Article XIV (\"Strikes and Lockouts\"), which\n\nprohibits strikes or lockouts during the life of the Agreement,\n\nprovided the parties comply with the terms therein.              The second is\n\nArticle IV, paragraph 11, which deals with the processing of\n\ngrievances related to Article IV (\"Work Jurisdiction\") and Article\n\nIV(A)    (\"Systems,     Modular,   and    Industrial    Structures\"),    which\n\nspecify the work that the parties have agreed will be performed by\n\nIUEC members under the Agreement.              Article IV, paragraph 11(a)\n\nrequires that such disputes \"be settled in accordance with the\n\ngrievance procedures in Article XV.\"              Paragraph 11(b) stipulates\n\nthat    while    work   disputes   are   \"being    processed   [Otis],   where\n\npossible, shall assign the employees work other than the work in\n\ndispute.\"       However, \"[w]here the work has progressed to a point\n\nwhere it is not possible to perform work other than the work in\n\ndispute, then the employees shall perform the disputed work pending\n\nfinal resolution as provided herein.\"             Art. IV, para. 11(b).\n\n            Finally,     in   Article    XV   (\"Arbitration\"),    the   parties\n\nunambiguously agreed that \"[a]ny difference or dispute regarding\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fthe application and construction of the Agreement\" constitutes a\n\n\"grievance\"    which     \"shall    be      resolved   under    the    [procedures\n\nestablished therein].\"       Art. XV, para. 1.          Article XV's grievance\n\nprocedures constitute an elaborate, integrated and well-detailed\n\nprocess intended by the parties to provide a modicum of industrial\n\njustice in the workplace, while at the same time allowing for\n\nstability in the collective bargaining relationship.\n\n             \"Any employee, local union, or [Otis]\" has the right to\n\ninitiate a grievance, first by presenting an oral complaint before\n\na designated representative of Otis (or the IUEC, when Otis is the\n\ngrievant) within ten working days of the grievance being known.\n\nId. para. 2.       If, after this initial interchange, the grievance\n\nremains unresolved, the aggrieved party has ten working days to\n\nformalize    the     complaint   in   a    written    form   provided      for   such\n\npurposes, thus moving the grievance procedure to the next step.\n\nId. para. 3.\n\n            At this point the matter is taken up by higher-level Otis\n\nand IUEC representatives, who must meet to again attempt to reach\n\na mutually satisfactory solution of the grievance.                   Id.    At this\n\nmeeting, the responding party is obligated to answer the written\n\ncomplaint.     Id.    Within ten working days thereafter, Otis or the\n\nIUEC, as the case may be, may indicate its dissatisfaction with the\n\nopposing party's answer by notifying that party of its intention to\n\n\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fappeal from the decision.             Id.     Any grievance disposition not\n\nappealed to the next step is final and binding on all parties.                    Id.\n\n            If appealed, the grievance then moves to the next step in\n\nthe process, in which the matter is placed on the agenda of a\n\nscheduled meeting of the National Arbitration Committee (\"NAC\").3\n\nId. para. 4.      At the NAC meeting, the responding party may make a\n\nwritten proposal for the disposition of the grievance.                     Id.     If\n\naccepted by the opposing party, the solution becomes a final and\n\nbinding disposition of the grievance on all parties.                 Id.    If not\n\naccepted, the aggrieved side may notify the other in writing of its\n\ndesire to seek arbitration of the grievance.                 Id.\n\n            The parties are then required to attempt to agree upon an\n\nimpartial arbitrator.       Id. para. 6.       If unable to do so, they must\n\njointly request arbitration before a member of the National Academy\n\nof    Arbitrators,   pursuant     to    the   Labor    Arbitration       Rules    and\n\nProcedures of the American Arbitration Association.                      Id.      The\n\ndecision of the arbitrator is final and binding on all parties.\n\nId.\n\n            Although      this   is    the    mandatory      procedure    for    the\n\nresolution   of    most    grievances,       Article   XV,    paragraph    9     also\n\nestablishes an expedited arbitration procedure in the case of\n\n\n3\n   The NAC meets once every calendar quarter. On the employer's\nside, the NAC is composed of Otis Director of Labor Relations (or\nhis designee) and two other Otis representatives, while the IUEC is\nrepresented by its General President (or his designee) and two\nother union representatives. Art. XV, para. 4.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fgrievances involving the discharge of an employee.      Within this\n\nlimited subset, the parties have agreed to a fast-track procedure\n\nfor discharge grievances not satisfactorily resolved after the\n\nmatter is grieved in the formal written step.     Id. para. 9.   At\n\nthis point, the controversy is directly referred for a discussion\n\nbetween Otis' Director of Labor Relations and the IUEC's General\n\nPresident, and if the matter is not resolved, either party may ask\n\nfor \"immediate, expedited impartial arbitration.\"    Id.\n\n          B.   The Concerted Activities\n\n          The present appeals arise from a work stoppage directed\n\nby Local 4 against Otis that resulted from a dispute over the use\n\nof cranes to hoist and put in place elevator plunger/cylinder\n\nunits.   Local 4 claims that this practice is prohibited by the\n\ncollective bargaining contract, which, it alleges, only allows use\n\nof a crane to hoist \"heavy material\" -- a term that includes\n\nplunger/cylinder units -- outside of building structures.     It is\n\nLocal 4's position that, inside buildings, these units must be\n\nhoisted manually.   Otis responds that the use of cranes to move the\n\nplunger/cylinder units in the manner to which Local 4 is now\n\nobjecting has been Otis' long-standing practice, a practice which\n\nit alleges was acquiesced in by Local 4 until recently.    In fact,\n\nit claims, during the prior year alone, plunger/cylinder units for\n\n50 to 60 elevators were installed with cranes.   Neither side filed\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fa grievance,4 although Otis claims it offered to submit the dispute\n\nto expedited arbitration, a proposal that apparently was not acted\n\nupon by the IUEC.            In fact, Local 4 officials have allegedly\n\nindicated that they will not file a grievance.\n\n            As    is   the   case   with   many    labor    disputes,    there   is\n\nconsiderably more background to this controversy than meets the\n\neye.   Throughout the spring of 2004, there arose a series of work\n\ncontroversies between Otis and Local 4 in various sites throughout\n\nMassachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine, all of which \"involved\n\nOtis' use of labor saving devices.\"                 Brief of Appellee/Cross-\n\nAppellant    at   9.     In    April    2004,     Otis    unsuccessfully      sought\n\ninjunctive relief in the U.S. District Court for the District of\n\nMaine against Local 4 over alleged work stoppage activities related\n\nto disputes about safety precautions for union members working in\n\nelevator hoist ways.         Otis Elevator Co. v. Local 4, Int'l Union of\n\nElevator    Constructors,       No.    04-00074     (D.    Me.   Apr.   14,   2004)\n\n(transcript of conference in chambers) (finding no cause for\n\ngranting equitable relief because the employees in question had\n\nalready returned to work).             Two days later, Otis again sought\n\ninjunctive relief, this time for alleged work stoppage activities\n\n\n4\n   Local 4 had, however, previously filed grievances concerning\ndisputes over the use of cranes for plunger/cylinder installation.\nOn both prior occasions, Otis rejected the grievances, and Local 4\ndid not appeal to the next step of the Article XV procedure, thus\nrendering Otis' objection binding. See Letters of May 5 and May 7,\n2004 from Dorothy L. Mynahan, Otis Branch Manager, to Michael\nLanger, IUEC.\n\n                                        -7-\n\frelated to the installation of prefabricated electronic components\n\nand pre-drilled, pre-tapped doors.            Otis Elevator Co. v. Local 4,\n\nInt'l Union of Elevator Constructors, No. 04-00074 (D. Me. Apr. 16,\n\n2004) (transcript of conference in chambers).                   The court again\n\ndenied a temporary restraining order, as it appeared that other\n\nwork could be continued while the dispute was addressed through the\n\nAgreement's grievance procedure.            Id. at 23-25.\n\n            Thereafter, commencing on May 13, 2004, Otis elevator\n\nemployees    at   the    Bentley      College       work     site    in     Waltham,\n\nMassachusetts reported being instructed by Local 4 officials to\n\nrefuse to work, purportedly over the installation of certain pre-\n\ntapped elevator doors.      The stoppage spread to other work sites in\n\nthe Boston area, with an additional eighteen elevator employees\n\neventually joining the refusal to work.                On May 14, 2004, Otis\n\nsought injunctive       relief   in   the    U.S.    District       Court   for   the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts, as a result of which the court issued an\n\norder on May 19, 2004 requiring arbitration of the dispute and\n\nenjoining the work stoppage \"pending resolution of all issues\n\ndeemed by the arbitrator to be related to the dispute over the\n\ninstallation of the elevator car doors.\"                   Otis Elevator Co. v.\n\nLocal 4, Int'l Union of Elevator Constructors, No. 04-10966 (D.\n\nMass. May 19, 2004) (Order to Arbitrate and Restraining Order).\n\n            On May 26, 2004, as a result of instructions given by\n\nLocal 4 officials to its members, Otis was unable to proceed with\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fthe    scheduled    installation      of   plunger/cylinder     units     at   four\n\nBoston-area job sites.         Otis' operations were seriously disrupted,\n\nas were those of other contractors at the building sites.                       For\n\nexample, at one job site, the contractor was forced to leave a hole\n\nopen    at   the    top   of    a   completed   building    frame    to     permit\n\ninstallation       of   the    plunger/cylinder   unit     at   a   later      date.\n\nFinishing work in the building could not proceed until the top of\n\nthe building was enclosed.          According to Otis representatives, the\n\nwork at the job sites in question had progressed to such a point\n\nthat, until the plunger/cylinder units were installed, no other\n\nwork was available to be assigned to the elevator mechanics. Thus,\n\nOtis claimed, two union members were sent home without pay for lack\n\nof work.     Local 4 saw the matter differently.\n\n             By May 27, 2004, 90 of the 110 Local 4 members Otis\n\nemployed in the Boston area, including all employees assigned to\n\nservice elevators, were reporting \"sick\" or absent \"for personal\n\nreasons.\"         Otis was thus unable to respond to service calls\n\ninvolving elevator malfunctions, including two such calls from a\n\nhospital.\n\n             C.    The Boys Markets Injunction\n\n             Otis proceeded to file for injunctive relief in the\n\nDistrict of Massachusetts under Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks\n\nUnion, Local 770, 398 U.S. 235 (1970).            After a brief hearing on\n\nMay 27, 2004, attended by attorneys for both parties and recessed\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\ftemporarily to allow the parties to submit proposed orders, the\n\ndistrict judge signed Local 4's draft order, finding in relevant\n\npart: (1) that the parties had a collective bargaining agreement,\n\nwhich contained a no-strike clause and a grievance and arbitration\n\nprovision applicable to the existing plunger/cylinder dispute; (2)\n\nthat the parties were claiming mutual breaches of the collective\n\nbargaining agreement; and (3) that ordinary principles of equity\n\nwarranted the granting of relief.          Otis Elevator Co. v. Local 4,\n\nInt'l Union of Elevator Constructors, No. 04-11108 (D. Mass.\n\nJun. 3, 2004) (Temporary Restraining Order); see also Boys Markets,\n\nInc., 398 U.S. at 254 (adopting conditions for injunctive relief).\n\nThe order, issued through June 7, 2004: (1) enjoined Local 4, and\n\nall in concert therewith, from striking or otherwise interfering\n\nwith Otis' normal operations; (2) required the parties to arbitrate\n\nthe plunger/cylinder dispute \"pursuant to the Expedited Labor\n\nArbitration Procedures of the American Arbitration Association\";\n\nand (3) restrained Otis from \"imposing discipline on Local 4\n\nmembers over contract disputes between Otis and Local 4, and from\n\napplying to the Court for further equitable relief unless it has\n\nfirst   offered   to   Local   4   the   opportunity   to   arbitrate   the\n\nunderlying dispute pursuant to the Expedited Labor Arbitration\n\nProcedures of the American Arbitration Association.\"\n\n           The court failed, however, to address Otis' objections to\n\nthose parts of the order imposing expedited extra-contractual\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\farbitration      of   the     plunger/cylinder         dispute,     and       prohibiting\n\ndisciplinary action against employees or the seeking of additional\n\nequitable relief, absent prior extra-contractual arbitration of\n\nsaid actions.      Otis' protestations were again of no avail when the\n\ndistrict    court,      on    June       17,   2004,    converted       the     temporary\n\nrestraining      order       into    a    preliminary     injunction           containing\n\nsubstantially the same conditions.\n\n            These     two     issues      constitute    the    principal        questions\n\nraised by Otis' appeal.5             The issues raised by Local 4's cross-\n\nappeal are better viewed as arguments in support of the district\n\ncourt's    order      than    as    objections     to    the   same.           Thus,   our\n\nconsideration of Local 4's cross-appeal is subsumed within, and\n\nwill be addressed as part of, Otis' appeal.\n\n                             II.     Standard of Review\n\n            A district court may grant a Boys Markets injunction\n\nprovided   the     petitioner        establishes       that:      (1)     a   collective\n\nbargaining agreement between the parties provides for mandatory\n\n\n5\n   Because we ultimately reverse those portions of the injunction\ndirected against Otis, we need not consider its additional claim\nthat the district court committed error in not granting an\nevidentiary hearing before issuing the preliminary injunction. See\n29 U.S.C. ยง 107 (requiring hearing prior to issuance of an\ninjunction in labor disputes).        As to the portion of the\npreliminary injunction that we affirm -- the prohibition on further\nwork stoppages by Local 4 -- no evidentiary hearing was necessary\nbecause the facts supporting that relief are not in dispute. See\nKansas City S. Transp. Co., Inc. v. Teamsters Local Union No. 41,\n126 F.3d 1059, 1067-68 (8th Cir. 1997) (holding that if 29 U.S.C.\nยง 107 applies to Boys Markets injunctions, it does not require an\nevidentiary hearing when injunction is based on undisputed facts).\n\n                                           -11-\n\fbinding arbitration; (2) the dispute giving rise to the concerted\n\naction which is sought to be enjoined is subject to binding\n\narbitration under that agreement; and (3) ordinary principles of\n\nequity warrant injunctive relief.              Nat'l Elevator Indus. v. Int'l\n\nUnion of Elevator Constructors, 776 F.2d 374, 376-77 (1st Cir.\n\n1985).\n\n            The issuance of a Boys Markets injunction is reviewed, as\n\nin   the   case    of    other   injunctions,       for    abuse    of   discretion.\n\nSee Gateway Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers, 414 U.S. 368, 387-88\n\n(1974); see also SEC v. Fife, 311 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\nQuestions of law are reviewed de novo, and those of fact are\n\nsubjected to a clear error standard.                Fife, 311 F.3d at 7.       There\n\nis an abuse of discretion by the trial court if an error of law is\n\ncommitted, or if it \"considers improper criteria, ignores criteria\n\nthat deserve       significant     weight,     or    [if   it]     gauges   only    the\n\nappropriate       criteria   but   makes   a    clear      error    of   judgment    in\n\nassaying them.\"         Rosario-Urdaz v. Rivera-Hernรกndez, 350 F.3d 219,\n\n221 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            With this framework of review to guide us, we turn to the\n\nactions of the district court in these appeals.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f                             III.    Analysis\n\n          A.   The Quid Pro Quo\n\n          Today,   it   is   a   fundamental    principle   of   industrial\n\nrelations in the United States that labor disputes are settled\n\nthrough voluntary arbitration rather than labor/management strife.\n\nCf. Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. 448, 458\n\n(1957) (identifying \"congressional policy toward settlement of\n\nlabor disputes by arbitration\").      As background to this principle,\n\nwe note that the use of injunctions in labor disputes has evolved\n\nthrough various stages, commencing with an early period during\n\nwhich the organization of labor for collective bargaining purposes\n\nwas considered a criminal enterprise, and the indiscriminate use of\n\nthe labor injunction to stop these activities was the order of the\n\nday. Cf. In re Debs, 158 U.S. 564, 586 (1895) (upholding President\n\nCleveland's power to obtain an injunction against the Pullman\n\nStrike despite the absence of any statutory authority, on the\n\ngrounds that \"the wrongs complained of [were] such as affect[ed]\n\nthe public at large\").       In response to a period of considerable\n\nlabor instability and unrest, Congress enacted the anti-injunction\n\nprovisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. ยง 101-115, which\n\ncontinues in effect to this day.      Nevertheless, changing times and\n\nthe growing strength of the unions eventually led to a relaxation\n\nof these stringent standards via Section 301(a) of the Labor-\n\nManagement Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. ยง 185(a) (providing federal\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\fcourts jurisdiction to hear disputes arising from violation of\n\ncollective bargaining agreements), as interpreted in Boys Markets,\n\n398    U.S.   at   250-54,    to   permit     labor   injunctions   in   limited\n\ncircumstances.\n\n              This path has not been without bumps and bruises.              All\n\nsides to labor strife have had to give some quid in exchange for\n\nsome quo.      To achieve a measure of labor peace and uninterrupted\n\nbusiness operations, employers have had to surrender some of their\n\ntraditional management prerogatives, subjecting many of these so-\n\ncalled rights to scrutiny and judgment before private, quasi-\n\njudicial fora in the form of arbitral tribunals.                    See Lincoln\n\nMills,   353    U.S.   at    455   (\"Plainly    the   agreement   to   arbitrate\n\ngrievance disputes is the quid pro quo for an agreement not to\n\nstrike.\").     The use of this voluntary system of dispute resolution\n\nis so prevalent today, not only in a labor relations setting, but\n\nin commerce and industry generally, as to hardly require further\n\ncomment.\n\n              One cardinal principle, however, needs to be kept in mind\n\nwhen   considering     the    issues   before     us.    Notwithstanding     our\n\ncomprehensive system of labor relations legislation in the United\n\nStates -- which, among other things, establishes the right of\n\nemployees to organize and negotiate with employers for collective\n\nbargaining purposes, 29 U.S.C. ยง 157 -- with few exceptions, the\n\ncontents of collective bargaining agreements are left to the\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fdiscretion and negotiating strength of the parties, see id. ยง 158\n\n(d).      That is, it is ultimately up to the parties to a collective\n\nbargaining agreement to determine what working conditions and\n\nsimilar matters they wish to agree upon, and make part of, their\n\ncontractual relationship. This includes which method, if any, they\n\nwill use to resolve disputes that arise during the course of their\n\ncollective      bargaining      agreement.       While     there   is   no    legal\n\nrequirement that employers and unions include a grievance and\n\narbitration procedure in their collective bargaining agreement, it\n\nseems that, in practice, almost all such agreements today do\n\ninclude a grievance and arbitration procedure.                However, this is\n\njust one of several items subject to mandatory negotiation, but\n\nwhich theoretically can be rejected by the parties from becoming\n\npart of the collective bargaining contract if they fail, in good\n\nfaith, to agree on said provision.             The point is that it is up to\n\nthe negotiating parties whether or not to agree to have a formal\n\nmethod for settling their labor/management differences, and it is\n\nup   to    them,   and   only   them,   to     determine   what    shall     be   the\n\nprocedure.      See id. ยงยง 158(a)(5), (b)(3), (d).\n\n              Once there is agreement, however, the chosen procedure is\n\nbinding on the parties and subject to judicial enforcement. Id. at\n\nยง 185.     Compliance with agreed-upon grievance procedures is highly\n\ndesirable from a public policy standpoint, to such a degree that if\n\na collective bargaining contract has a binding grievance and\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\farbitration clause, Boys Markets relief is available even without\n\nthe existence of a specific no-strike clause in the contract.\n\nGateway Coal Co., 414 U.S. at 381; see also Boys Markets, 398 U.S.\n\nat 248 (\"[A] no-strike obligation, express or implied, is the quid\n\npro quo for an undertaking by the employer to submit grievance\n\ndisputes to . . . arbitration.\") (emphasis added).             Once a court\n\ndetermines that a dispute between the parties is covered by a\n\nbinding grievance and arbitration agreement between them, the court\n\nshould    enforce   the   arbitration   provisions   of   that   agreement.\n\nLincoln Mills, 353 U.S. at 455 (stating that the Labor Relations\n\nManagement Act \"expresses a federal policy that federal courts\n\nshould enforce [collective bargaining] agreements on behalf of or\n\nagainst labor organizations and that industrial peace can best be\n\nobtained only in that way\"); Int'l Detective Serv., Inc. v. Int'l\n\nBhd. of Teamsters, Local 251, 614 F.2d 29, 32 (1st Cir. 1980) (\"The\n\nSupreme Court has consistently emphasized and promoted federal\n\npolicy which encourages peaceful settlement of labor disputes\n\nthrough    compelling     arbitration     under   collective     bargaining\n\nagreements.\").\n\n            B.   The Injunction\n\n            In the instant case, the district court reached the\n\nessentially uncontested conclusion that a work stoppage was being\n\npromoted by Local 4 against Otis over the use of cranes to place\n\nplunger/cylinder units, a dispute subject to the grievance and\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\farbitration procedures detailed in Article XV of the Agreement.\n\nBoth parties had agreed to use those procedures for resolving their\n\ndisputes.     Otis indicated its willingness to submit the dispute to\n\nthe agreed process, but, for whatever reason, Local 4 chose not to\n\navail itself of that process and instead promoted a concerted work\n\nstoppage in violation of the no-strike clause in Article XIV of the\n\nAgreement.       The       district    court       correctly     enjoined      the      work\n\nstoppage,      and    rightly     ordered          the     parties    to     submit     the\n\nplunger/cylinder dispute to arbitration.                     It should have stopped\n\nthere.\n\n            Unfortunately, the district court went further, and in\n\ndoing so exceeded its discretion by requiring that the parties\n\nsubmit   to     an    arbitration       regime           different    than     what     was\n\ncontractually bargained for. For example, Otis points out that the\n\nExpedited Labor Arbitration Procedures of the American Arbitration\n\nAssociation, unlike the arbitration procedures provided for in\n\nArticle XV of the Agreement, do not permit the parties to choose\n\nthe arbitrator and explicitly prohibit the filing of post-hearing\n\nbriefs   and    the    preparation      of     a    stenographic      record       of    the\n\nproceedings.         The    district    court's          abrogation    of    the   regime\n\ncontractually bargained for was inappropriate. Only the procedures\n\nof the Agreement, voluntarily agreed upon in good faith by the\n\n\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fparties, could be enforced by the court.6            It was beyond the\n\ndistrict court's power to go further under the circumstances, and,\n\nin doing so, it contravened the policies promoted by Boys Markets,\n\n398 U.S. at 248, and Lincoln Mills, 353 U.S. at 455.      The equitable\n\npowers of a court are not a warrant for reforming the conditions of\n\na collective bargaining agreement.\n\n           The district court's intrusion into the disciplinary\n\nauthority of Otis, restraining it from taking action against\n\nemployees engaged in strike activity in violation of the no-strike\n\nclause, is also an abuse of discretion.      An employee who engages in\n\nsuch conduct engages in unprotected activity and as such may be\n\nsubject to discipline.    See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. NLRB, 592 F.2d\n\n595,   604-05   (1st   Cir.   1979)   (upholding   employer's   right   to\n\ndiscipline employee engaged in activities not protected by the\n\nNational Labor Relations Act, including \"activities . . . in breach\n\nof contract\"); see also NLRB v. Sands Mfg. Co., 306 U.S. 332, 344\n\n(1939).   The employee may, of course, challenge such an accusation\n\n\n6\n   We note that the Supreme Court approved an order, which did not\npreempt any previously agreed-upon procedure, that was issued to\neliminate   a   potentially  unsafe   working  condition   pending\narbitration. Gateway Coal Co., 414 U.S. 368 (approving court\nordered suspension, pending arbitration, of foreman whom union\nbelieved to pose a safety risk). No such order is at issue in the\ninstant case. Moreover, we express no view at this time on what\nlimited measures to order expedition of existing grievance\nprocedures, if any, lie within a court's equitable authority, nor\non what circumstances justify their use. See Hanna Min. Co. v.\nUnited Steelworkers, 464 F.2d 565, 569 (8th Cir. 1972).        The\nprocedure ordered here diverged from that agreed upon by the\nparties in more than just the time requirements.\n\n                                  -18-\n\fby use of the contract's grievance and arbitration procedure, but\n\nthe district court exceeded its authority in preempting the normal\n\nand agreed upon process for dealing with such matters.\n\n             The district court's last imposition upon Otis, barring\n\nit from requesting further equitable relief from the court unless\n\nOtis first extends an offer to Local 4 to arbitrate the dispute\n\npursuant     to    a   procedure   other    than      the   one    outlined   in   the\n\nAgreement, is on particularly shaky ground.                       A federal court's\n\nability to restrict a litigant's access to the courts by issuing an\n\ninjunction prohibiting any further filing, although not unheard of,\n\ncan   only    be       justified   \"in    extreme      circumstances       involving\n\ngroundless encroachment upon the limited time and resources of the\n\ncourt and other parties.\"          Castro v. United States, 775 F.2d 399,\n\n408 (1st Cir. 1985).         The district court's cryptic orders give no\n\nexplanation in support of this unusual directive, nor can we find\n\nany on the record unless we consider Otis' two prior requests for\n\nrelief, previously described, as the sub silentio basis for its\n\naction.    But \"litigiousness alone will not support an injunction\n\nagainst a plaintiff.\"         Pavilonis v. King, 626 F.2d 1075, 1079 (1st\n\nCir. 1980).        Otis' filings pale in comparison with those rare\n\ninstances in which limitation of access to the courts has been\n\njustified.         See,    e.g.,   Castro,      775    F.2d   at    409   (upholding\n\ninjunction against further filings against employer for nonrenewal\n\nbecause multiple actions filed were intended only to harass,\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fcontained virtually identical allegations, and were personally\n\ninsulting to defendant and its counsel).\n\n          Considering   the   above,    we   affirm   that   part   of   the\n\npreliminary injunction which orders Local 4 to cease and desist\n\nfrom engaging in or promoting concerted activities against Otis, or\n\nin any way interfering with its normal operations. All other parts\n\nof the preliminary injunction issued on June 17, 2004 are reversed,\n\nand the matter is remanded for the district court to modify the\n\npreliminary injunction to indicate that any grievance by Local 4\n\nconcerning the use of a crane to hoist and place a plunger/cylinder\n\nunit must be processed as indicated in Article XV of the Agreement.\n\n          It is so ordered.    Costs are taxed against Local 4.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\f",

The Collective Bargaining Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 9, 2002, Otis and IUEC, on behalf of Local 4 and other local unions, entered into a five-year collective bargaining agreement (\"the Agreement\") that covers all of Otis' elevator employees in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. The Agreement contains three provisions central to the present appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first is Article XIV (\"Strikes and Lockouts\"), which prohibits strikes or lockouts during the life of the Agreement, provided the parties comply with the terms therein. The second is Article IV, paragraph 11, which deals with the processing of grievances related to Article IV (\"Work Jurisdiction\") and Article IV(A) (\"Systems, Modular, and Industrial Structures\"), which specify the work that the parties have agreed will be performed by IUEC members under the Agreement. Article IV, paragraph 11(a) requires that such disputes \"be settled in accordance with the grievance procedures in Article XV.\" Paragraph 11(b) stipulates that while work disputes are \"being processed [Otis], where possible, shall assign the employees work other than the work in dispute.\" However, \"[w]here the work has progressed to a point where it is not possible to perform work other than the work in dispute, then the employees shall perform the disputed work pending final resolution as provided herein.\" Art.

XV, para. 1. Article XV's grievance procedures constitute an elaborate, integrated and well-detailed process intended by the parties to provide a modicum of industrial justice in the workplace, while at the same time allowing for stability in the collective bargaining relationship.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Any employee, local union, or [Otis]\" has the right to initiate a grievance, first by presenting an oral complaint before a designated representative of Otis (or the IUEC, when Otis is the grievant) within ten working days of the grievance being known. <i>Id.</i> para. 2. If, after this initial interchange, the grievance remains unresolved, the aggrieved party has ten working days to formalize the complaint in a written form provided for such purposes, thus moving the grievance procedure to the next step. <i>Id.</i> para. 3.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point the matter is taken up by higher-level Otis and IUEC representatives, who must meet to again attempt to reach a mutually satisfactory solution of the grievance. <i>Id.</i> At this meeting, the responding party is obligated to answer the written complaint. <i>Id.</i> Within ten working days thereafter, Otis or the IUEC, as the case may be, may indicate its dissatisfaction with the opposing party's answer by notifying that party of its intention to appeal from the decision. <i>Id.</i> Any grievance disposition not appealed to the next step is final and binding on all parties. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If appealed, the grievance then moves to the next step in the process, in which the matter is placed on the agenda of a scheduled meeting of the National Arbitration Committee (\"NAC\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Id.</i> para. 4.

At this point, the controversy is directly referred for a discussion between Otis' Director of Labor Relations and the IUEC's General President, and if the matter is not resolved, either party may ask for \"immediate, expedited impartial arbitration.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Concerted Activities</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present appeals arise from a work stoppage directed by Local 4 against Otis that resulted from a dispute over the use of cranes to hoist and put in place elevator plunger/cylinder units. Local 4 claims that this practice is prohibited by the collective bargaining contract, which, it alleges, only allows use of a crane to hoist \"heavy material\"&#8212;a term that includes plunger/cylinder units&#8212;outside of building structures. It is Local 4's position that, inside buildings, these units must be hoisted manually. Otis responds that the use of cranes to move the plunger/cylinder units in the manner to which Local 4 is now objecting has been Otis' long-standing practice, a practice which it alleges was acquiesced in by Local 4 until recently. In fact, it claims, during the prior year alone, plunger/cylinder units for 50 to 60 elevators were installed with cranes. Neither side filed a grievance,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> although Otis claims it offered to submit the dispute to expedited arbitration, a proposal that apparently was not acted upon by the IUEC. In fact, Local 4 officials have allegedly indicated that they will not file a grievance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is the case with many labor disputes, there is considerably more background to this controversy than meets the eye. Throughout the spring of 2004, there arose a series of work controversies between Otis and Local 4 in various sites throughout Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine, all of which \"involved Otis' use of labor saving devices.\" Brief of Appellee/Cross-Appellant at 9. In April 2004, Otis unsuccessfully sought injunctive relief in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine against Local 4 over alleged work stoppage activities related to disputes about safety precautions for union members working in elevator hoist ways. <i>Otis Elevator Co. v. Local 4, Int'l Union of Elevator Constructors,</i> No. 04-00074 (D. Me. Apr. 14, 2004) (transcript of conference in chambers) (finding no cause for granting equitable relief because the employees in question had already returned to work). Two days later, Otis again sought injunctive relief, this time for alleged work stoppage activities related to the installation of prefabricated electronic components and pre-drilled, pre-tapped doors. <i>Otis Elevator Co. v. Local 4, Int'l Union of Elevator Constructors,</i> No. 04-00074 (D.Me. Apr. 16, 2004) (transcript of conference in chambers). The court again denied a temporary restraining order, as it appeared that other work could be continued while the dispute was addressed through the Agreement's grievance procedure. <i>Id.</i> at 23-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, commencing on May 13, 2004, Otis elevator employees at the Bentley College work site in Waltham, Massachusetts reported being instructed by Local 4 officials to refuse to work, purportedly over the installation of certain pre-tapped elevator doors. The stoppage spread to other work sites in the Boston area, with an additional eighteen elevator employees eventually joining the refusal to work. On May 14, 2004, Otis sought injunctive relief in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, as a result of which the court issued an order on May 19, 2004 requiring arbitration of the dispute and enjoining the work stoppage \"pending resolution of all issues deemed by the arbitrator to be related to the dispute over the installation of the elevator car doors.\" <i>Otis Elevator Co. v.

Otis' operations were seriously disrupted, as were those of other contractors at the building sites. For example, at one job site, the contractor was forced to leave a hole open at the top of a completed building frame to permit installation of the plunger/cylinder unit at a later date. Finishing work in the building could not proceed until the top of the building was enclosed. According to Otis representatives, the work at the job sites in question had progressed to such a point that, until the plunger/cylinder units were installed, no other work was available to be assigned to the elevator mechanics. Thus, Otis claimed, two union members were sent home without pay for lack of work. Local 4 saw the matter differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By May 27, 2004, 90 of the 110 Local 4 members Otis employed in the Boston area, including all employees assigned to service elevators, were reporting \"sick\" or absent \"for personal reasons.\" Otis was thus unable to respond to service calls involving elevator malfunctions, including two such calls from a hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

After a brief hearing on May 27, 2004, attended by attorneys for both parties and recessed temporarily to allow the parties to submit proposed orders, the district judge signed Local 4's draft order, finding in relevant part: (1) that the parties had a collective bargaining agreement, which contained a no-strike clause and a grievance and arbitration provision applicable to the existing plunger/cylinder dispute; (2) that the parties were claiming mutual breaches of the collective bargaining agreement; and (3) that ordinary principles of equity warranted the granting of relief. <i>Otis Elevator Co. v. Local 4, Int'l Union of Elevator Constructors,</i> No. 04-11108 (D.Mass. Jun. 3, 2004) (Temporary Restraining Order); <i>see also Boys Markets, Inc.,</i> 398 U.S. at 254, 90 S.Ct. 1583 (adopting conditions for injunctive relief). The order, issued through June 7, 2004:(1) enjoined Local 4, and all in concert therewith, from striking or otherwise interfering with Otis' normal operations; (2) required the parties to arbitrate the plunger/cylinder dispute \"pursuant to the Expedited Labor Arbitration Procedures of the American Arbitration Association\"; and (3) restrained Otis from \"imposing discipline on Local 4 members over contract disputes between Otis and Local 4, and from applying to the Court for further equitable relief unless it has first offered to Local 4 the opportunity to arbitrate the underlying dispute pursuant to the Expedited Labor Arbitration Procedures of the American Arbitration Association.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court failed, however, to address Otis' objections to those parts of the order imposing expedited extra-contractual arbitration of the plunger/cylinder dispute, and prohibiting disciplinary action against employees or the seeking of additional equitable relief, absent prior extra-contractual arbitration of said actions. Otis' protestations were again of no avail when the district court, on June 17, 2004, converted the temporary restraining order into a preliminary injunction containing substantially the same conditions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These two issues constitute the principal questions raised by Otis' appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The issues raised by Local 4's cross-appeal are better viewed as arguments in support of the district court's order than as objections to the same. Thus, our consideration of Local 4's cross-appeal is subsumed within, and will be addressed as part of, Otis' appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A district court may grant a <i>Boys Markets</i> injunction provided the petitioner establishes that: (1) a collective bargaining agreement between the parties provides for mandatory binding arbitration; (2) the dispute giving rise to the concerted action which is sought to be enjoined is subject to binding arbitration under that agreement; and (3) ordinary principles of equity warrant injunctive relief. <i>Nat'l Elevator Indus. v. Int'l Union of Elevator Constructors,</i> 776 F.2d 374, 376-77 (1st Cir.1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issuance of a <i>Boys Markets</i> injunction is reviewed, as in the case of other injunctions, for abuse of discretion. <i>See Gateway Coal Co. v. United Mine Workers,</i> 414 U.S. 368, 387-88, 94 S.Ct. 629, 38 L.Ed.2d 583 (1974); <i>see also SEC v. Fife,</i> 311 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2002). Questions of law are reviewed <i>de novo,</i> and those of fact are subjected to a clear error standard. <i>Fife,</i> 311 F.3d at 7. There is an abuse of discretion by the trial court if an error of law is committed, or if it \"considers improper criteria, ignores criteria that deserve significant weight, or [if it] gauges only the appropriate criteria but makes a clear error of judgment in assaying them.\" <i>Rosario-Urdaz v. Rivera-Hern&#225;ndez,</i> 350 F.3d 219, 221 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With this framework of review to guide us, we turn to the actions of the district court in these appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Analysis</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The <i>Quid Pro Quo</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Today, it is a fundamental principle of industrial relations in the United States that labor disputes are settled through voluntary arbitration rather than labor/management strife. <i>Cf. Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills,</i> 353 U.S. 448, 458, 77 S.Ct. 912, 1 L.Ed.2d 972 (1957) (identifying \"congressional policy toward settlement of labor disputes by arbitration\"). As background to this principle, we note that the use of injunctions in labor disputes has evolved through various stages, commencing with an early period during which the organization of labor for collective bargaining purposes was considered a criminal enterprise, and the indiscriminate use of the labor injunction to stop these activities was the order of the day. <i>Cf. In re Debs,</i> 158 U.S. 564, 586, 15 S.Ct. 900, 39 L.Ed. 1092 (1895) (upholding President Cleveland's power to obtain an injunction against the Pullman Strike despite the absence of any statutory authority, on the grounds that \"the wrongs complained of [were] such as affect[ed] the public at large\"). In response to a period of considerable labor instability and unrest, Congress enacted the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 101-115, which continues in effect to this day. Nevertheless, changing times and the growing strength of the unions eventually led to a relaxation of these stringent standards via Section 301(a) of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185(a) (providing federal courts jurisdiction to hear disputes arising from violation of collective bargaining agreements), as interpreted in <i>Boys Markets,</i> 398 U.S. at 250-54, 90 S.Ct. 1583, to permit labor injunctions in limited circumstances.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This path has not been without bumps and bruises. All sides to labor strife have had to give some <i>quid</i> in exchange for some <i>quo.</i> To achieve a measure of labor peace and uninterrupted business operations, employers have had to surrender some of their traditional management prerogatives, subjecting many of these so-called rights to scrutiny and judgment before private, quasi-judicial fora in the form of arbitral tribunals. <i>See Lincoln Mills,</i> 353 U.S. at 455, 77 S.Ct. 912 (\"Plainly the agreement to arbitrate grievance disputes is the <i>quid pro quo</i> for an agreement not to strike.\"). The use of this voluntary system of dispute resolution is so prevalent today, not only in a labor relations setting, but in commerce and industry generally, as to hardly require further comment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One cardinal principle, however, needs to be kept in mind when considering the issues before us. Notwithstanding our comprehensive system of labor relations legislation in the United States&#8212;which, among other things, establishes the right of employees to organize and negotiate with employers for collective bargaining purposes, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 157&#8212;with few exceptions, the contents of collective bargaining agreements are left to the discretion and negotiating strength of the parties, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 158(d). That is, it is ultimately up to the parties to a collective bargaining agreement to determine what working conditions and similar matters they wish to agree upon, and make part of, their contractual relationship. This includes which method, <i>if any,</i> they will use to resolve disputes that arise during the course of their collective bargaining agreement. While there is no legal requirement that employers and unions include a grievance and arbitration procedure in their collective bargaining agreement, it seems that, in practice, almost all such agreements today do include a grievance and arbitration procedure. However, this is just one of several items subject to mandatory negotiation, but which theoretically can be rejected by the parties from becoming part of the collective bargaining contract if they fail, in good faith, to agree on said provision. The point is that it is up to the negotiating parties whether or not to agree to have a formal method for settling their labor/management differences, and it is up to them, and only them, to determine what shall be the procedure. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 158(a)(5), (b)(3), (d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once there is agreement, however, the chosen procedure is binding on the parties and subject to judicial enforcement. <i>Id.</i> at &#167; 185. Compliance with agreed-upon grievance procedures is highly desirable from a public policy standpoint, to such a degree that if a collective bargaining contract has a binding grievance and arbitration clause, <i>Boys Markets</i> relief is available even without the existence of a specific no-strike clause in the contract. <i>Gateway Coal Co.,</i> 414 U.S. at 381, 94 S.Ct. 629; <i>see also Boys Markets,</i> 398 U.S. at 248, 90 S.Ct. 1583 (\"[A] no-strike obligation, express <i>or implied,</i> is the <i>quid pro quo</i> for an undertaking by the employer to submit grievance disputes to ... arbitration.\") (emphasis added). Once a court determines that a dispute between the parties is covered by a binding grievance and arbitration agreement between them, the court should enforce the arbitration provisions of that agreement. <i>Lincoln Mills,</i> 353 U.S. at 455, 77 S.Ct. 912 (stating that the Labor Relations Management Act \"expresses a federal policy that federal courts should enforce [collective bargaining] agreements on behalf of or against labor organizations and that industrial peace can best be obtained only in that way\"); <i>Int'l Detective Serv., Inc. v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, Local 251,</i> 614 F.2d 29, 32 (1st Cir.1980) (\"The Supreme Court has consistently emphasized and promoted federal policy which encourages peaceful settlement of labor disputes through compelling arbitration under collective bargaining agreements.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. The Injunction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, the district court reached the essentially uncontested conclusion that a work stoppage was being promoted by Local 4 against Otis over the use of cranes to place plunger/cylinder units, a dispute subject to the grievance and arbitration procedures detailed in Article XV of the Agreement. Both parties had agreed to use those procedures for resolving their disputes. Otis indicated its willingness to submit the dispute to the agreed process, but, for whatever reason, Local 4 chose not to avail itself of that process and instead promoted a concerted work stoppage in violation of the no-strike clause in Article XIV of the Agreement. The district court correctly enjoined the work stoppage, and rightly ordered the parties to submit the plunger/cylinder dispute to arbitration. It should have stopped there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Unfortunately, the district court went further, and in doing so exceeded its discretion by requiring that the parties submit to an arbitration regime different than what was contractually bargained for. For example, Otis points out that the Expedited Labor Arbitration Procedures of the American Arbitration Association, unlike the arbitration procedures provided for in Article XV of the Agreement, do not permit the parties to choose the arbitrator and explicitly prohibit the filing of post-hearing briefs and the preparation of a stenographic record of the proceedings. The district court's abrogation of the regime contractually bargained for was inappropriate. Only the procedures of the Agreement, voluntarily agreed upon in good faith by the parties, could be enforced by the court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> It was beyond the district court's power to go further under the circumstances, and, in doing so, it contravened the policies promoted by <i>Boys Markets,</i> 398 U.S. at 248, 90 S.Ct. 1583, and <i>Lincoln Mills,</i> 353 U.S. at 455, 77 S.Ct. 912. The equitable powers of a court are not a warrant for reforming the conditions of a collective bargaining agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's intrusion into the disciplinary authority of Otis, restraining it from taking action against employees engaged in strike activity in violation of the no-strike clause, is also an abuse of discretion. An employee who engages in such conduct engages in unprotected activity and as such may be subject to discipline. <i>See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v.</i> <i>NLRB,</i> 592 F.2d 595, 604-05 (1st Cir.1979) (upholding employer's right to discipline employee engaged in activities not protected by the National Labor Relations Act, including \"activities . . . in breach of contract\"); <i>see also NLRB v. Sands Mfg. Co.,</i> 306 U.S. 332, 344, 59 S.Ct. 508, 83 L.Ed. 682 (1939). The employee may, of course, challenge such an accusation by use of the contract's grievance and arbitration procedure, but the district court exceeded its authority in preempting the normal and agreed upon process for dealing with such matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's last imposition upon Otis, barring it from requesting further equitable relief from the court unless Otis first extends an offer to Local 4 to arbitrate the dispute pursuant to a procedure other than the one outlined in the Agreement, is on particularly shaky ground. A federal court's ability to restrict a litigant's access to the courts by issuing an injunction prohibiting any further filing, although not unheard of, can only be justified \"in extreme circumstances involving groundless encroachment upon the limited time and resources of the court and other parties.\" <i>Castro v. United States,</i> 775 F.2d 399, 408 (1st Cir.1985). The district court's cryptic orders give no explanation in support of this unusual directive, nor can we find any on the record unless we consider Otis' two prior requests for relief, previously described, as the <i>sub silentio</i> basis for its action. But \"litigiousness alone will not support an injunction against a plaintiff.\" <i>Pavilonis v. King,</i> 626 F.2d 1075, 1079 (1st Cir.1980). Otis' filings pale in comparison with those rare instances in which limitation of access to the courts has been justified. <i>See, e.g., Castro,</i> 775 F.2d at 409 (upholding injunction against further filings against employer for nonrenewal because multiple actions filed were intended only to harass, contained virtually identical allegations, and were personally insulting to defendant and its counsel).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering the above, we <i>affirm</i> that part of the preliminary injunction which orders Local 4 to cease and desist from engaging in or promoting concerted activities against Otis, or in any way interfering with its normal operations. All other parts of the preliminary injunction issued on June 17, 2004 are <i>reversed</i>, and the matter is <i>remanded</i> for the district court to modify the preliminary injunction to indicate that any grievance by Local 4 concerning the use of a crane to hoist and place a plunger/cylinder unit must be processed as indicated in Article XV of the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.

As to the portion of the preliminary injunction that we affirm&#8212;the prohibition on further work stoppages by Local 4&#8212;no evidentiary hearing was necessary because the facts supporting that relief are not in dispute. <i>See Kansas City S. Transp. Co., Inc. v. Teamsters Local Union No. 41,</i> 126 F.3d 1059, 1067-68 (8th Cir.1997) (holding that <i>if</i> 29 U.S.C. &#167; 107 applies to <i>Boys Markets</i> injunctions, it does not require an evidentiary hearing when injunction is based on undisputed facts).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We note that the Supreme Court approved an order, which did not preempt any previously agreed-upon procedure, that was issued to eliminate a potentially unsafe working condition pending arbitration<i>Gateway Coal Co.,</i> 414 U.S. 368, 94 S.Ct. 629, 38 L.Ed.2d 583 (approving court ordered suspension, pending arbitration, of foreman whom union believed to pose a safety risk).

Otis employs elevator mechanics, helpers and apprentices, all of whom are represented for collective bargaining purposes by the International Union of Elevator Constructors (\"IUEC\") on behalf of its locals, including Defendant-Appellee/Cross-Appellant IUEC Local 4 (\"Local 4\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Collective Bargaining Agreement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 9, 2002, Otis and IUEC, on behalf of Local 4 and other local unions, entered into a five-year collective bargaining agreement (\"the Agreement\") that covers all of Otis' elevator employees in Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. The Agreement contains three provisions central to the present appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first is Article XIV (\"Strikes and Lockouts\"), which prohibits strikes or lockouts during the life of the Agreement, provided the parties comply with the terms therein. The second is Article IV, paragraph 11, which deals with the processing of grievances related to Article IV (\"Work Jurisdiction\") and Article IV(A) (\"Systems, Modular, and Industrial Structures\"), which specify the work that the parties have agreed will be performed by IUEC members under the Agreement. Article IV, paragraph 11(a) requires that such disputes \"be settled in accordance with the grievance procedures in Article XV.\" Paragraph 11(b) stipulates that while work disputes are \"being processed [Otis], where possible, shall assign the employees work other than the work in dispute.\" However, \"[w]here the work has progressed to a point where it is not possible to perform work other than the work in dispute, then the employees shall perform the disputed work pending final resolution as provided herein.\" Art.

The Concerted Activities</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The present appeals arise from a work stoppage directed by Local 4 against Otis that resulted from a dispute over the use of cranes to hoist and put in place elevator plunger/cylinder units. Local 4 claims that this practice is prohibited by the collective bargaining contract, which, it alleges, only allows use of a crane to hoist \"heavy material\"&#8212;a term that includes plunger/cylinder units&#8212;outside of building structures. It is Local 4's position that, inside buildings, these units must be hoisted manually. Otis responds that the use of cranes to move the plunger/cylinder units in the manner to which Local 4 is now objecting has been Otis' long-standing practice, a practice which it alleges was acquiesced in by Local 4 until recently. In fact, it claims, during the prior year alone, plunger/cylinder units for 50 to 60 elevators were installed with cranes. Neither side filed a grievance,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> although Otis claims it offered to submit the dispute to expedited arbitration, a proposal that apparently was not acted upon by the IUEC. In fact, Local 4 officials have allegedly indicated that they will not file a grievance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is the case with many labor disputes, there is considerably more background to this controversy than meets the eye. Throughout the spring of 2004, there arose a series of work controversies between Otis and Local 4 in various sites throughout Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine, all of which \"involved Otis' use of labor saving devices.\" Brief of Appellee/Cross-Appellant at 9. In April 2004, Otis unsuccessfully sought injunctive relief in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maine against Local 4 over alleged work stoppage activities related to disputes about safety precautions for union members working in elevator hoist ways. <i>Otis Elevator Co. v. Local 4, Int'l Union of Elevator Constructors,</i> No. 04-00074 (D. Me. Apr. 14, 2004) (transcript of conference in chambers) (finding no cause for granting equitable relief because the employees in question had already returned to work). Two days later, Otis again sought injunctive relief, this time for alleged work stoppage activities related to the installation of prefabricated electronic components and pre-drilled, pre-tapped doors. <i>Otis Elevator Co. v. Local 4, Int'l Union of Elevator Constructors,</i> No. 04-00074 (D.Me. Apr. 16, 2004) (transcript of conference in chambers). The court again denied a temporary restraining order, as it appeared that other work could be continued while the dispute was addressed through the Agreement's grievance procedure. <i>Id.</i> at 23-25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, commencing on May 13, 2004, Otis elevator employees at the Bentley College work site in Waltham, Massachusetts reported being instructed by Local 4 officials to refuse to work, purportedly over the installation of certain pre-tapped elevator doors. The stoppage spread to other work sites in the Boston area, with an additional eighteen elevator employees eventually joining the refusal to work. On May 14, 2004, Otis sought injunctive relief in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, as a result of which the court issued an order on May 19, 2004 requiring arbitration of the dispute and enjoining the work stoppage \"pending resolution of all issues deemed by the arbitrator to be related to the dispute over the installation of the elevator car doors.\" <i>Otis Elevator Co. v.

Otis' operations were seriously disrupted, as were those of other contractors at the building sites. For example, at one job site, the contractor was forced to leave a hole open at the top of a completed building frame to permit installation of the plunger/cylinder unit at a later date. Finishing work in the building could not proceed until the top of the building was enclosed. According to Otis representatives, the work at the job sites in question had progressed to such a point that, until the plunger/cylinder units were installed, no other work was available to be assigned to the elevator mechanics. Thus, Otis claimed, two union members were sent home without pay for lack of work. Local 4 saw the matter differently.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By May 27, 2004, 90 of the 110 Local 4 members Otis employed in the Boston area, including all employees assigned to service elevators, were reporting \"sick\" or absent \"for personal reasons.\" Otis was thus unable to respond to service calls involving elevator malfunctions, including two such calls from a hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C.

Textile Workers Union v. Lincoln Mills,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105511\"><a href=\"/opinion/105511/textile-workers-v-lincoln-mills-of-ala/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">448</span></a></span>, 458, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105511\"><a href=\"/opinion/105511/textile-workers-v-lincoln-mills-of-ala/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

As background to this principle, we note that the use of injunctions in labor disputes has evolved through various stages, commencing with an early period during which the organization of labor for collective bargaining purposes was considered a criminal enterprise, and the indiscriminate use of the labor injunction to stop these activities was the order of the day. <i>Cf. In re Debs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94238\"><a href=\"/opinion/94238/in-re-debs/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">564</span></a></span>, 586, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">15</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In response to a period of considerable labor instability and unrest, Congress enacted the anti-injunction provisions of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 101-115, which continues in effect to this day. Nevertheless, changing times and the growing strength of the unions eventually led to a relaxation of these stringent standards via Section 301(a) of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 185(a) (providing federal courts jurisdiction to hear disputes arising from violation of collective bargaining agreements), as interpreted in <i>Boys Markets,</i> 398 U.S. at 250-54, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108154\"><a href=\"/opinion/108154/boys-markets-inc-v-retail-clerks/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

All sides to labor strife have had to give some <i>quid</i> in exchange for some <i>quo.</i> To achieve a measure of labor peace and uninterrupted business operations, employers have had to surrender some of their traditional management prerogatives, subjecting many of these so-called rights to scrutiny and judgment before private, quasi-judicial fora in the form of arbitral tribunals. <i>See Lincoln Mills,</i> 353 U.S. at 455, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"105511\"><a href=\"/opinion/105511/textile-workers-v-lincoln-mills-of-ala/\"><span class=\"volume\">77</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Notwithstanding our comprehensive system of labor relations legislation in the United States&#8212;which, among other things, establishes the right of employees to organize and negotiate with employers for collective bargaining purposes, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 157&#8212;with few exceptions, the contents of collective bargaining agreements are left to the discretion and negotiating strength of the parties, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 158(d). That is, it is ultimately up to the parties to a collective bargaining agreement to determine what working conditions and similar matters they wish to agree upon, and make part of, their contractual relationship. This includes which method, <i>if any,</i> they will use to resolve disputes that arise during the course of their collective bargaining agreement. While there is no legal requirement that employers and unions include a grievance and arbitration procedure in their collective bargaining agreement, it seems that, in practice, almost all such agreements today do include a grievance and arbitration procedure. However, this is just one of several items subject to mandatory negotiation, but which theoretically can be rejected by the parties from becoming part of the collective bargaining contract if they fail, in good faith, to agree on said provision. The point is that it is up to the negotiating parties whether or not to agree to have a formal method for settling their labor/management differences, and it is up to them, and only them, to determine what shall be the procedure. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 158(a)(5), (b)(3), (d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once there is agreement, however, the chosen procedure is binding on the parties and subject to judicial enforcement. <i>Id.</i> at &#167; 185.

Both parties had agreed to use those procedures for resolving their disputes. Otis indicated its willingness to submit the dispute to the agreed process, but, for whatever reason, Local 4 chose not to avail itself of that process and instead promoted a concerted work stoppage in violation of the no-strike clause in Article XIV of the Agreement. The district court correctly enjoined the work stoppage, and rightly ordered the parties to submit the plunger/cylinder dispute to arbitration.

For example, Otis points out that the Expedited Labor Arbitration Procedures of the American Arbitration Association, unlike the arbitration procedures provided for in Article XV of the Agreement, do not permit the parties to choose the arbitrator and explicitly prohibit the filing of post-hearing briefs and the preparation of a stenographic record of the proceedings. The district court's abrogation of the regime contractually bargained for was inappropriate. Only the procedures of the Agreement, voluntarily agreed upon in good faith by the parties, could be enforced by the court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> It was beyond the district court's power to go further under the circumstances, and, in doing so, it contravened the policies promoted by <i>Boys Markets,</i> 398 U.S. at 248, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108154\"><a href=\"/opinion/108154/boys-markets-inc-v-retail-clerks/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The employee may, of course, challenge such an accusation by use of the contract's grievance and arbitration procedure, but the district court exceeded its authority in preempting the normal and agreed upon process for dealing with such matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's last imposition upon Otis, barring it from requesting further equitable relief from the court unless Otis first extends an offer to Local 4 to arbitrate the dispute pursuant to a procedure other than the one outlined in the Agreement, is on particularly shaky ground. A federal court's ability to restrict a litigant's access to the courts by issuing an injunction prohibiting any further filing, although not unheard of, can only be justified \"in extreme circumstances involving groundless encroachment upon the limited time and resources of the court and other parties.\" <i>Castro v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"460032\"><a href=\"/opinion/460032/39-fair-emplpraccas-162-38-empl-prac-dec-p-35583-eligio-castro-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">775</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span>, 408 (1st Cir.1985). The district court's cryptic orders give no explanation in support of this unusual directive, nor can we find any on the record unless we consider Otis' two prior requests for relief, previously described, as the <i>sub silentio</i> basis for its action. But \"litigiousness alone will not support an injunction against a plaintiff.\" <i>Pavilonis v. King,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"380759\"><a href=\"/opinion/380759/anne-m-pavilonis-v-edward-j-king/\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1075</span></a></span>, 1079 (1st Cir.1980). Otis' filings pale in comparison with those rare instances in which limitation of access to the courts has been justified. <i>See, e.g., Castro,</i> 775 F.2d at 409 (upholding injunction against further filings against employer for nonrenewal because multiple actions filed were intended only to harass, contained virtually identical allegations, and were personally insulting to defendant and its counsel).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Considering the above, we <i>affirm</i> that part of the preliminary injunction which orders Local 4 to cease and desist from engaging in or promoting concerted activities against Otis, or in any way interfering with its normal operations. All other parts of the preliminary injunction issued on June 17, 2004 are <i>reversed</i>, and the matter is <i>remanded</i> for the district court to modify the preliminary injunction to indicate that any grievance by Local 4 concerning the use of a crane to hoist and place a plunger/cylinder unit must be processed as indicated in Article XV of the Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>It is so ordered.

On both prior occasions, Otis rejected the grievances, and Local 4 did not appeal to the next step of the Article XV procedure, thus rendering Otis' objection binding<i>See</i> Letters of May 5 and May 7, 2004 from Dorothy L.

As to the portion of the preliminary injunction that we affirm&#8212;the prohibition on further work stoppages by Local 4&#8212;no evidentiary hearing was necessary because the facts supporting that relief are not in dispute. <i>See Kansas City S.
