This appeal by Loida Sánchez-\n\nFigueroa (Sánchez) and her mother and sister, Luisa Figueroa-\n\nMaldonado and Elizabeth Sánchez-Figueroa, respectively, challenges\n\nthe district court's grant of summary judgment to appellee Banco\n\nPopular de Puerto Rico (Banco Popular). Before the district court,\n\nappellants alleged that Banco Popular, Sánchez's former employer,\n\nfailed to provide Sánchez with a reasonable accommodation for her\n\ndisability in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act\n\n(ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.                The district court concluded\n\nthat, based on the summary judgment record properly before it,\n\nSánchez had failed to establish a prima facie case of disability\n\ndiscrimination.        We affirm the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment.     In doing so, we note that this case is another example\n\nof the unfortunate consequences for litigants of their failure to\n\ncomply with the District of Puerto Rico's Local Rules on summary\n\njudgment.1\n\n                                        I.\n\n             We recite the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nnon-moving    party,     relying   upon      the    record     as   defined    by   the\n\ndistrict     court's    ruling   that     the      appellant    had   not     properly\n\ncontroverted the facts set forth by the appellee in support of its\n\n\n\n\n     1\n        We take no position on whether appellants' claims would\nhave survived summary judgment if they had complied with the Local\nRules.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fmotion for summary judgment.2      CMI Capital Mkt. Inv., LLC v.\n\nGonzález-Toro, 520 F.3d 58, 61 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n            1n 1989, Sánchez started working as a part-time office\n\nclerk for Banco Popular.   She was promoted to a position as a full-\n\ntime customer service representative in 1995.         As a customer\n\nservice representative, she sold the bank's products to new and\n\nexisting customers and assisted customers over the phone with their\n\nbanking transactions, such as deposits, withdrawals, and payments.\n\nHer job performance was by all accounts exemplary.\n\n            On October 29, 2001, while Sánchez was assisting a\n\ncustomer on the phone, she determined that she needed the aid of\n\none of her supervisors and placed the customer on hold.        When\n\nSánchez sought a particular supervisor's attention, the supervisor\n\nallegedly refused to help her. Upon returning to her desk, Sánchez\n\ndiscovered that the customer had hung up the phone.   At that point,\n\nSánchez suddenly suffered from, in her words, \"a lack of emotional\n\ncontrol.\"\n\n            On that same day, Sánchez filed a workers' compensation\n\nreport with the Puerto Rico State Insurance Fund (SIF), identifying\n\nher mental health concerns stemming from this earlier incident.\n\nSIF evaluated Sánchez and recommended that she should go on sick\n\nleave indefinitely beginning October 30, 2001. While on leave, her\n\n\n\n     2\n      We discuss the district court's basis for this ruling in the\nnext section.\n\n                                 -3-\n\ftreating    psychiatrist,    Dr.    Eli     Rojas,    diagnosed    her   with   a\n\ntemporary condition called mixed situational disorder.               He advised\n\nBanco Popular that when she returned to work, she should be placed\n\nin a position that did not involve \"dealing with the public.\"\n\n            In September 2002, a human resources officer at Banco\n\nPopular discussed with Sánchez the position she would take upon\n\nreturning from her leave. Sánchez alleges that the human resources\n\nofficer forced her under duress to go back to her previous position\n\nas a daytime telephonic customer service representative and that\n\nshe was crying when she agreed to do so.          Moreover, she claims that\n\nBanco Popular never offered her a position that \"did not entail\n\ninterfac[ing] with the public.\" Banco Popular contends that it did\n\noffer Sánchez several positions that were responsive to her request\n\nto avoid dealing with the public, including positions as an office\n\nclerk and as a nighttime telephonic customer service representative\n\n(which typically had a lower volume of calls).                    Banco Popular\n\nasserts    that   Sánchez    turned    down     all   of   these    alternative\n\npositions.\n\n            On October 7, 2002, after using 343 days of her 360-day\n\njob reserve period under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 11 P.R.\n\nLaws § 1 et seq.,       Sánchez returned to her previous position as a\n\ndaytime    telephonic    customer     service    representative.         Sánchez\n\ncontinued to work in this position until she had a relapse of her\n\nemotional instability on March 24, 2003; she then went back on\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fleave.   When the remaining 17 days of Sánchez's job reserve period\n\nended and she failed to return to work, Banco Popular terminated\n\nher employment.\n\n           On September 15, 2003, Sánchez filed an administrative\n\ncomplaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC),\n\nalleging that Banco Popular had discriminated against her in\n\nviolation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12101 et seq., and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n2000e et seq.   Upon receiving a right to sue letter from the EEOC\n\non December 23, 2004,   Sánchez filed a timely complaint, with her\n\nsister and her mother as co-plaintiffs, in the District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico.      Before the district court, she\n\nreiterated the arguments she made to the EEOC.        Banco Popular\n\nanswered the complaint on April 28, 2005, asserting that Sánchez\n\nwas not disabled within the meaning of the ADA and, in the\n\nalternative, that it had offered her a reasonable accommodation.\n\n           Almost a year later, after the parties had engaged in\n\ndiscovery, Banco Popular filed its Motion for Summary Judgment,\n\naccompanied by the required statement of facts.3   Sánchez filed her\n\nBrief in Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment, which\n\npurported to be in adherence with the Local Rules, as well as a\n\n\n     3\n       Local Rule 56(b) states: \"A motion for summary judgment\nshall be supported by a separate, short, and concise statement of\nmaterial facts, set forth in numbered paragraphs, as to which the\nmoving party contends there is no genuine issue of material fact to\nbe tried.\"\n\n                                -5-\n\fcounter-statement of facts.4        The district court found that the\n\nplaintiffs' response was not in compliance with the Local Rules as\n\nevidenced by \"the disorganized and convoluted statement of facts,\n\nspanning multiple documents\" in violation of Local Rule 56(c) and\n\nexhibits that were not properly translated from Spanish into\n\nEnglish in violation of Local Rule 10(b).           The court noted that\n\nbecause the plaintiffs failed to comply with the rules, it was\n\npermitted   to   treat   the   moving   party's   statement   of   facts   as\n\nuncontested.     Alsina-Ortiz v. Laboy, 400 F.3d 77, 80 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n            Having reached this conclusion, the district court turned\n\nto the question of whether Banco Popular was entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law.       Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).         The \"entry of a\n\nsummary judgment motion as unopposed does not automatically give\n\n\n\n     4\n       Local Rule 56(c) states: \"A party opposing a motion for\nsummary judgment shall submit with its opposition a separate,\nshort, and concise statement of material facts.       The opposing\nstatement shall admit, deny or qualify the facts by reference to\neach numbered paragraph of the moving party's statement of material\nfacts and unless a fact is admitted, shall support each denial or\nqualification by a record citation as required by this rule. The\nopposing statement may contain in a separate section additional\nfacts, set forth in separate numbered paragraphs and supported by\na record citation as required by subsection (e) of this rule.\"\n     Local Rule 56(e) provides: \"An assertion of fact set forth in\na statement of material facts shall be followed by a citation to a\nspecific page or paragraph of identified record material supporting\nthe assertion.\"     If a party fails to comply, the court may\ndisregard the material lacking a specific citation.        D.P.R.R.\n10(b). Moreover, the court has no duty to search for or consider\nparts of the record that are not specifically referenced in the\nstatement of facts. Id.\n\n                                    -6-\n\frise to a grant of summary judgment\" because the district court\n\nstill must consider the plaintiff's ADA claim based on the record\n\nproperly before the court, viewing the uncontested facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to the non-moving party.                       Aguiar-Carrasquillo\n\nv. Agosto-Alicea, 445 F.3d 19, 25 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                 To assess whether Banco Popular was entitled to summary\n\njudgment, the district court considered whether, on the uncontested\n\nrecord, Sánchez had established a prima facie claim of disability\n\ndiscrimination under the ADA.                Given the requirements of the Act,\n\nthe court evaluated whether (1) she was disabled within the meaning\n\nof   the    ADA,       (2)    she   was    qualified    to    perform      the    essential\n\nfunctions         of    her    job,       either    with     or     without      reasonable\n\naccommodations, and (3) her employer took adverse action against\n\nher because of her disability.                      See Bailey v. Georgia-Pacific\n\nCorp., 306 F.3d 1162, 1166 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                 The district court said that it \"would be justified in\n\nholding that Sánchez's impairment did not qualify as a disability\n\nunder      the    ADA    as    Sánchez's     impairment       was    not   substantially\n\nlimiting.\"         However, the district court went on to explain that\n\n\"even if the Court accepts that Sánchez was a disabled individual\n\nwithin the ADA, her claims still fail\" because Banco Popular\n\n\n\n\n                                              -7-\n\foffered her a reasonable accommodation and she did not suffer an\n\nadverse employment action by virtue of her disability.5\n\n             We read the court's statement about Sánchez's impairment\n\nas tantamount to a finding on the uncontested record that she was\n\nnot disabled within the meaning of the ADA.          However, even if the\n\ncourt intended a less definitive statement, we assess de novo the\n\ndistrict court's decision to grant summary judgment to Banco\n\nPopular,     Cabán Hernández v. Philip Morris USA, Inc., 486 F.3d 1,\n\n8 (1st Cir. 2007), and may affirm the district court's decision on\n\nany ground supported by the record, Estades-Negroni v. Assocs.\n\nCorp. of N. Am., 377 F.3d 58, 62 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                      II.\n\n             Before reaching the merits of Sánchez's claim, we review\n\nfor abuse of discretion the district court's assessment that the\n\nmotion     for   summary   judgment   was   uncontested   because   of   the\n\nplaintiffs' failure to comply with the District of Puerto Rico's\n\nLocal Rules.       Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc., 361 F.3d 22, 25 (1st\n\nCir. 2004)(explaining that the \"application of a district court's\n\nlocal rule[s] is reviewed for abuse of discretion\" and \"a special\n\ndegree of deference [is accorded]. . . to a court's interpretation\n\nof   its   own   rules\")(internal     quotations   omitted).   Here,     the\n\n\n      5\n       The district court also rejected Sánchez's civil rights\nclaim, finding \"[t]here is simply no evidence whatsoever before the\nCourt which demonstrates that [Banco Popular's] treatment of\nSánchez was at all related to her race.\" Sánchez has abandoned\nthis claim on appeal.\n\n                                      -8-\n\fappellants' counter-statement of facts did not comply with the\n\nLocal Rules.   The citations to the record often referenced several\n\nexhibits in support of a specific contention, without indicating\n\nwhich pages or paragraphs were relevant.             See Cabán Hernández, 486\n\nF.3d at 7 (\"[T]he appellants did not adhere to the record citation\n\nrequirement.   .    .    .   '[F]acts'    memorialized    in     their   counter-\n\nstatement    were       supported   only       by   references     to    multiple\n\nexhibits.\").   This lack of specificity left the district court \"to\n\ngrope unaided for factual needles in a documentary haystack\" in\n\ncontravention of the intent of Local Rule 56, which is \"to prevent\n\nparties from unfairly shifting the burdens of litigation to the\n\ncourt.\"   Id. at 8.\n\n            Moreover, the appellants' counter-statement of facts\n\nreferred to about forty different exhibits, of which fewer than\n\nfive were properly translated by a certified court interpreter.\n\nThese submissions were a flagrant violation of Local Rule 10(b),\n\nwhich requires that all documents presented to the district court\n\nshall be accompanied by a certified English translation.                 D.P.R.R.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\f10(b).6   The appellants acknowledge as much, citing their lack of\n\nfinancial resources as an excuse.7\n\n           Although there is no mechanical rule that establishes\n\nwhether a statement is properly \"short\" and \"concise\" or whether\n\nthe   citations   within   the   opposing   statements   are   adequately\n\nspecific, the filings provided by the appellants did not \"even\n\narguably comply with the spirit or the letter of the rule[s],\"\n\nparticularly to the extent that they referred to untranslated\n\nexhibits that were not properly before the court.          The district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in treating Banco Popular's\n\nstatement of facts as uncontested.        We review its summary judgment\n\ndetermination on that basis.8\n\n      6\n       Local Rule 10(b) requires: \"All documents not in the English\nlanguage which are presented to or filed in this Court, whether as\nevidence or otherwise, shall be accompanied at the time of the\npresentation or filing by an English translation thereof, unless\nthe Court shall otherwise order. Such English translation shall be\ncertified by a Court interpreter, except that such certificate may\nbe waived by stipulation of the parties.\"\n      7\n       Some of these untranslated documents were translated and\nsubmitted on appeal.      However, we cannot consider on appeal\ndocuments that were not considered below. Aguiar-Carrasquillo, 445\nF.3d at 25 (\"Because these exhibits were not considered below, we\ncannot consider them now.\").\n      8\n       We note one inconsistency in the court's evaluation of the\nsummary judgment record.    Having concluded that Banco Popular's\nstatement of material facts would be treated as uncontested, the\ncourt then proceeded to consider the psychiatric report by Dr. Aida\nL. Delgado Mateo, which was included as an exhibit to appellants'\ncounter-statement of material facts.       On the basis of this\ndocument, the court decided that there were \"conflicting\npsychiatric reports\" that gave rise to a genuine issue of material\nfact. The court's reliance on this document was inconsistent with\nits ruling, here affirmed, that Banco Popular's statement of facts\n\n                                   -10-\n\f                                  III.\n\n          Turning   to    the   merits,    we   assess   whether   Sánchez\n\nestablished a prima facie case of disability discrimination within\n\nthe meaning of the ADA.    A disability under the ADA is defined as\n\n(1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one\n\nor more of a person's major life activities; (2) a record of having\n\nsuch an impairment; or (3) being regarded as having such an\n\nimpairment.   42 U.S.C. § 12102(2).       We need only consider whether\n\nSánchez met the first definition of disability because she waived\n\nher argument with respect to the other two definitions.9\n\n\n\n\nwas uncontested. Therefore, we exclude Dr. Delgado Mateo's report\nfrom our analysis of the court's summary judgment ruling.\n     We wish to comment further on this inconsistency point. As\nnoted, the district court's ruling on the appellant's noncompliance\nwith the local rule on summary judgment permitted the court to\ntreat the moving party's statement of material facts as\nuncontested. Nonetheless, the district court considered materials\nsubmitted by the nonmoving party in opposition to summary judgment\nin deciding whether the movant was entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law. This inconsistency creates uncertainty on appeal about the\nscope of the summary judgment record.       If the district court\nchooses to conduct alternative analyses -- one viewing the moving\nparty's summary judgment motion as uncontested, the other viewing\nthe motion as properly contested in whole or in part -- it would be\nhelpful to us if the court explicitly acknowledged this alternative\napproach.\n     9\n       On appeal, appellants argue for the first time that all\nthree of these definitions of disability applied to Sánchez during\nthe time she was employed by Banco Popular. Generally, we will not\nconsider issues raised by the parties for the first time on appeal.\nSee B & T Masonry Constr. Co., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Mut. Ins., Co.,\n382 F.3d 36, 40-41 (1st Cir. 2004). Appellants do not even attempt\nan argument for deviating from this general rule.\n\n                                  -11-\n\f              The        Supreme    Court       explained      in    Toyota     Motors\n\nManufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams that an impairment's\n\nimpact      must    be     \"permanent      or   long   term\"    to    be   considered\n\nsubstantially limiting within the meaning of the ADA.                         534 U.S.\n\n184,    198   (2002).         We    have    interpreted     this     requirement    as\n\n\"encompass[ing] conditions that are potentially long-term, in that\n\ntheir duration is indefinite and unknowable, but not those that are\n\nbrief or foreseeably temporary.\"                Guzmán-Rosario v. United Parcel\n\nService, Inc., 397 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 2005)(internal quotations\n\nomitted).\n\n              Here, the record clearly establishes that Sánchez did not\n\nhave a substantially limiting condition because her impairment was\n\nforeseeably temporary.             After Sánchez requested an accommodation,\n\nDr. Rojas completed the medical questionnaire provided by Banco\n\nPopular.10         Dr.    Rojas    stated    that   Sánchez's       condition   (mixed\n\nsituational disorder) was \"not permanent\" and that her \"[p]rognosis\n\nis good.\"     In a later deposition, Dr. Rojas explicitly said that at\n\nthe time he completed the questionnaire, he perceived the condition\n\nto be temporary.           On that basis alone, the district court ruled\n\n\n\n\n       10\n        The ADA regulations state than an employer may need to\nengage in an informal, interactive process with a disabled\nemployee.   29 C.F.R. § 1630.2(o)(3) (2005); see also Tobin v.\nLiberty Mut. Ins. Co., 433 F.3d 100, 108 (1st Cir. 2005). Part of\nthis process may involve gathering information from a treating\nphysician regarding the nature of the impairment.\n\n                                            -12-\n\fcorrectly that the appellants did not establish a prima facie claim\n\nfor relief under the ADA.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f",

She was promoted to a position as a full-\n\ntime customer service representative in 1995.         As a customer\n\nservice representative, she sold the bank's products to new and\n\nexisting customers and assisted customers over the phone with their\n\nbanking transactions, such as deposits, withdrawals, and payments.\n\nHer job performance was by all accounts exemplary.\n\n            On October 29, 2001, while Sánchez was assisting a\n\ncustomer on the phone, she determined that she needed the aid of\n\none of her supervisors and placed the customer on hold.        When\n\nSánchez sought a particular supervisor's attention, the supervisor\n\nallegedly refused to help her. Upon returning to her desk, Sánchez\n\ndiscovered that the customer had hung up the phone.   At that point,\n\nSánchez suddenly suffered from, in her words, \"a lack of emotional\n\ncontrol.\"\n\n            On that same day, Sánchez filed a workers' compensation\n\nreport with the Puerto Rico State Insurance Fund (SIF), identifying\n\nher mental health concerns stemming from this earlier incident.\n\nSIF evaluated Sánchez and recommended that she should go on sick\n\nleave indefinitely beginning October 30, 2001. While on leave, her\n\n\n\n     2\n      We discuss the district court's basis for this ruling in the\nnext section.\n\n                                 -3-\n\ftreating    psychiatrist,    Dr.    Eli     Rojas,    diagnosed    her   with   a\n\ntemporary condition called mixed situational disorder.               He advised\n\nBanco Popular that when she returned to work, she should be placed\n\nin a position that did not involve \"dealing with the public.\"\n\n            In September 2002, a human resources officer at Banco\n\nPopular discussed with Sánchez the position she would take upon\n\nreturning from her leave. Sánchez alleges that the human resources\n\nofficer forced her under duress to go back to her previous position\n\nas a daytime telephonic customer service representative and that\n\nshe was crying when she agreed to do so.          Moreover, she claims that\n\nBanco Popular never offered her a position that \"did not entail\n\ninterfac[ing] with the public.\" Banco Popular contends that it did\n\noffer Sánchez several positions that were responsive to her request\n\nto avoid dealing with the public, including positions as an office\n\nclerk and as a nighttime telephonic customer service representative\n\n(which typically had a lower volume of calls).                    Banco Popular\n\nasserts    that   Sánchez    turned    down     all   of   these    alternative\n\npositions.\n\n            On October 7, 2002, after using 343 days of her 360-day\n\njob reserve period under the Workmen's Compensation Act, 11 P.R.\n\nLaws § 1 et seq.,       Sánchez returned to her previous position as a\n\ndaytime    telephonic    customer     service    representative.         Sánchez\n\ncontinued to work in this position until she had a relapse of her\n\nemotional instability on March 24, 2003; she then went back on\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fleave.   When the remaining 17 days of Sánchez's job reserve period\n\nended and she failed to return to work, Banco Popular terminated\n\nher employment.\n\n           On September 15, 2003, Sánchez filed an administrative\n\ncomplaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC),\n\nalleging that Banco Popular had discriminated against her in\n\nviolation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C.\n\n§ 12101 et seq., and the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §\n\n2000e et seq.   Upon receiving a right to sue letter from the EEOC\n\non December 23, 2004,   Sánchez filed a timely complaint, with her\n\nsister and her mother as co-plaintiffs, in the District Court for\n\nthe District of Puerto Rico.      Before the district court, she\n\nreiterated the arguments she made to the EEOC.        Banco Popular\n\nanswered the complaint on April 28, 2005, asserting that Sánchez\n\nwas not disabled within the meaning of the ADA and, in the\n\nalternative, that it had offered her a reasonable accommodation.\n\n           Almost a year later, after the parties had engaged in\n\ndiscovery, Banco Popular filed its Motion for Summary Judgment,\n\naccompanied by the required statement of facts.3   Sánchez filed her\n\nBrief in Opposition to the Motion for Summary Judgment, which\n\npurported to be in adherence with the Local Rules, as well as a\n\n\n     3\n       Local Rule 56(b) states: \"A motion for summary judgment\nshall be supported by a separate, short, and concise statement of\nmaterial facts, set forth in numbered paragraphs, as to which the\nmoving party contends there is no genuine issue of material fact to\nbe tried.\"\n\n                                -5-\n\fcounter-statement of facts.4        The district court found that the\n\nplaintiffs' response was not in compliance with the Local Rules as\n\nevidenced by \"the disorganized and convoluted statement of facts,\n\nspanning multiple documents\" in violation of Local Rule 56(c) and\n\nexhibits that were not properly translated from Spanish into\n\nEnglish in violation of Local Rule 10(b).           The court noted that\n\nbecause the plaintiffs failed to comply with the rules, it was\n\npermitted   to   treat   the   moving   party's   statement   of   facts   as\n\nuncontested.

Given the requirements of the Act,\n\nthe court evaluated whether (1) she was disabled within the meaning\n\nof   the    ADA,       (2)    she   was    qualified    to    perform      the    essential\n\nfunctions         of    her    job,       either    with     or     without      reasonable\n\naccommodations, and (3) her employer took adverse action against\n\nher because of her disability.

This lack of specificity left the district court \"to\n\ngrope unaided for factual needles in a documentary haystack\" in\n\ncontravention of the intent of Local Rule 56, which is \"to prevent\n\nparties from unfairly shifting the burdens of litigation to the\n\ncourt.\"   Id. at 8.\n\n            Moreover, the appellants' counter-statement of facts\n\nreferred to about forty different exhibits, of which fewer than\n\nfive were properly translated by a certified court interpreter.\n\nThese submissions were a flagrant violation of Local Rule 10(b),\n\nwhich requires that all documents presented to the district court\n\nshall be accompanied by a certified English translation.

The district\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in treating Banco Popular's\n\nstatement of facts as uncontested.        We review its summary judgment\n\ndetermination on that basis.8\n\n      6\n       Local Rule 10(b) requires: \"All documents not in the English\nlanguage which are presented to or filed in this Court, whether as\nevidence or otherwise, shall be accompanied at the time of the\npresentation or filing by an English translation thereof, unless\nthe Court shall otherwise order. Such English translation shall be\ncertified by a Court interpreter, except that such certificate may\nbe waived by stipulation of the parties.\"\n      7\n       Some of these untranslated documents were translated and\nsubmitted on appeal.      However, we cannot consider on appeal\ndocuments that were not considered below. Aguiar-Carrasquillo, 445\nF.3d at 25 (\"Because these exhibits were not considered below, we\ncannot consider them now.\").\n      8\n       We note one inconsistency in the court's evaluation of the\nsummary judgment record.    Having concluded that Banco Popular's\nstatement of material facts would be treated as uncontested, the\ncourt then proceeded to consider the psychiatric report by Dr. Aida\nL. Delgado Mateo, which was included as an exhibit to appellants'\ncounter-statement of material facts.       On the basis of this\ndocument, the court decided that there were \"conflicting\npsychiatric reports\" that gave rise to a genuine issue of material\nfact. The court's reliance on this document was inconsistent with\nits ruling, here affirmed, that Banco Popular's statement of facts\n\n                                   -10-\n\f                                  III.\n\n          Turning   to    the   merits,    we   assess   whether   Sánchez\n\nestablished a prima facie case of disability discrimination within\n\nthe meaning of the ADA.    A disability under the ADA is defined as\n\n(1) a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one\n\nor more of a person's major life activities; (2) a record of having\n\nsuch an impairment; or (3) being regarded as having such an\n\nimpairment.   42 U.S.C. § 12102(2).       We need only consider whether\n\nSánchez met the first definition of disability because she waived\n\nher argument with respect to the other two definitions.9\n\n\n\n\nwas uncontested. Therefore, we exclude Dr. Delgado Mateo's report\nfrom our analysis of the court's summary judgment ruling.\n     We wish to comment further on this inconsistency point. As\nnoted, the district court's ruling on the appellant's noncompliance\nwith the local rule on summary judgment permitted the court to\ntreat the moving party's statement of material facts as\nuncontested. Nonetheless, the district court considered materials\nsubmitted by the nonmoving party in opposition to summary judgment\nin deciding whether the movant was entitled to judgment as a matter\nof law. This inconsistency creates uncertainty on appeal about the\nscope of the summary judgment record.       If the district court\nchooses to conduct alternative analyses -- one viewing the moving\nparty's summary judgment motion as uncontested, the other viewing\nthe motion as properly contested in whole or in part -- it would be\nhelpful to us if the court explicitly acknowledged this alternative\napproach.\n     9\n       On appeal, appellants argue for the first time that all\nthree of these definitions of disability applied to Sánchez during\nthe time she was employed by Banco Popular. Generally, we will not\nconsider issues raised by the parties for the first time on appeal.\nSee B & T Masonry Constr. Co., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Mut.
