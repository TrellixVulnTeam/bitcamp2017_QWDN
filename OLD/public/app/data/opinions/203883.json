STARR,\n\n                       Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                    v.\n\n                        DENIS DUBE, ET AL.,\n\n                      Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n         [Hon. Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Darren Starr on brief pro se.\n     Glenn A. Perlow, Assistant Attorney General, and Kelly A.\nAyotte, Attorney General, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                            June 24, 2009\n\f          Per Curiam.      In his 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 suit, pro se New\n\nHampshire state inmate Darren Starr sued certain prison employees\n\nor officials, alleging that a false disciplinary charge was filed\n\nagainst him and that a destructive search was made of his cell in\n\nretaliation for his exercise of First Amendment rights.            In an\n\nOrder   dated   December   7,   2007,   the   district    court   granted\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment on the retaliation claim\n\nbased on the disciplinary charge.       Subsequently, a trial was held\n\non the cell search retaliation claim, and, on February 6, 2008, the\n\njury returned a special verdict against Starr.           On February 7,\n\n2008, the district court issued judgment in defendants' favor, and\n\nStarr filed this appeal.\n\n          On appeal, Starr objects to the district court's summary\n\njudgment decision and to certain of its trial-related rulings.        We\n\naffirm the district court's judgment in favor of the defendants for\n\nthe following reasons.\n\n          1. Starr objects to the district court's pretrial ruling\n\ndenying his request for a subpoena to obtain the testimony of a\n\ncertain corrections officer at trial.         He also    argues that the\n\ndistrict court erroneously instructed the jury as to his burden of\n\nproof on one element of his retaliation claim.            After careful\n\nreview of the record and the parties' appellate contentions,\n\nhowever, we conclude that the district court did not abuse its\n\ndiscretion in denying Starr's motion for a subpoena, or err in the\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fjury instruction it gave.     See McDonald v. Hall, 610 F.2d 16, 18\n\n(1st Cir. 1979) (\"Plaintiff must prove that he would not have been\n\ntransferred 'but for' the [retaliatory] reason.\").\n\n            2.   Starr contends that the district court's summary\n\njudgment decision was erroneous.    We review that decision de novo,\n\nevaluating whether there is any genuine issue as to a material fact\n\nand whether defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of\n\nlaw.     Scottsdale Ins. Co. v. Torres, 561 F.3d 74, 77 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).\n\n            The disciplinary charge against Starr was dismissed about\n\na week after it was filed.       At the disciplinary hearing, the\n\nhearing officer agreed with Starr's argument that the investigation\n\nof the charge had been improper.    Starr received no discipline or\n\nother sanction due to the filing of the disciplinary charge.\n\n            Based on the above undisputed facts, the district court\n\nheld, as a matter of law, that the adverse act alleged was \"de\n\nminimis\" and thus did not give rise to a cognizable retaliation\n\nclaim under ยง 1983.   The court relied on the reasoning in Morris v.\n\nPowell, 449 F.3d 682 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 549 U.S. 1038\n\n(2006), where the circuit court adopted the standard used in other\n\ncircuits for evaluating the sufficiency of a particular adverse act\n\nalleged by a prisoner raising a retaliation claim.        Under that\n\nstandard, an adverse act is not de minimis if it \"would chill or\n\nsilence a person of ordinary firmness from future First Amendment\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\factivities.\"      Applying the standard, the Fifth Circuit found that\n\ncertain adverse acts would be de minimis--acts that cause an inmate\n\nonly   a   \"few    days   of    discomfort,\"   impose    \"a    [single]   minor\n\nsanction,\" or impose an otherwise constitutional restriction on the\n\ninmate.    449 F.3d at 685-86 (mentioning the facts in that case and\n\nprior circuit cases).          As the district court pointed out, filing a\n\ndisciplinary charge that is dismissed constitutes an adverse act\n\nthat is \"less substantial than the least substantial de minimis act\n\nidentified by the Morris court.\"\n\n            On appeal, Starr accepts that his retaliation claim must\n\nbe premised on an adverse act of a kind that would deter persons of\n\n\"ordinary firmness\" from exercising their constitutional rights in\n\nthe future.       He argues that the filing of the disciplinary charge\n\nagainst him met that standard because it exposed him to maximum\n\npenalties that included punitive segregation and a loss of good\n\ntime credits.       There is case law in his favor.           Brown v. Crowley\n\n(\"Brown\"), 312 F.3d 782, 789 (6th Cir. 2002) (majority decision),\n\ncert. denied, 540 U.S. 823 (2003) (a reasonable jury could find\n\nthat filing a retaliatory charge exposing an inmate to a \"risk of\n\nsignificant sanctions\" could deter persons of \"ordinary firmness\"\n\nfrom exercising their rights); Zarska v. Higgins, 171 Fed. Appx.\n\n255,   259-60     (10th   Cir.    2006)   (unpublished   decision)     (filing\n\nretaliatory disciplinary proceedings \"would chill a person of\n\nordinary firmness\" from future exercise of his or her rights)\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f(citation omitted); cf. Dixon v. Brown, 38 F.3d 379, 379-80 (8th\n\nCir. 1994) (a prisoner who has presented evidence that a \"false\"\n\ndisciplinary charge was filed for retaliatory reasons does not have\n\nto \"show a separate, independent injury\").\n\n           We do not find the reasoning in the above cases to be\n\npersuasive on the facts of this case.              As a prison policy directive\n\ncontained in the record indicates, Starr was entitled to several\n\nopportunities to present his version of the facts to neutral\n\ndecisionmakers.       Indeed,      at     his      disciplinary   hearing,    he\n\nsuccessfully obtained dismissal of the charge against him after\n\npointing out the irregularity in the prison's investigation of the\n\ncharge.    Starr has not contended that it would be futile for\n\ninmates   at   his   prison   to   try        to   defend   themselves   against\n\nretaliatory disciplinary charges.\n\n           The procedures in the prison policy directive serve to\n\nprotect inmates from the threat of punishment that is posed by a\n\nretaliatory disciplinary charge.          On the facts here, we cannot say\n\nthat a reasonable fact-finder could conclude that inmates of\n\n\"ordinary firmness\" would be deterred from continuing to exercise\n\ntheir constitutional rights merely because of the filing of a\n\ndisciplinary charge carrying potentially severe sanctions.                   See\n\nPittman v. Tucker, 213 Fed. Appx. 867, 871-72 (11th Cir. 2007)\n\n(unpublished per curiam) (the court \"could not conclude that a\n\nperson of ordinary firmness would be deterred from exercising his\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fFirst Amendment rights\" where inmates could defend themselves\n\nagainst a charge before being disciplined and there was no evidence\n\nor claim that it would be futile to attempt a defense); accord\n\nBrown, supra, 321 F.3d at 801-02 (dissenting opinion by Rosen,\n\nD.J., sitting by designation).

Gilbert, 557 F.3d 541, 555 (7th Cir. 2009)\n\n(a \"single [allegedly unjustified] retaliatory charge that is later\n\ndismissed is insufficient to serve as the basis of a ยง 1983\n\naction\").\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",
