Perez-Gimenez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n              Coffin and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     H. Manuel Hernandez on brief for appellant.\n     H. S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Sonia I. Torres-Pabon,\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Thomas F. Klumper, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         December 8, 2004\n\f     COFFIN, Senior Circuit Judge. The issue raised in this appeal\n\nis whether the district court committed reversible error in its\n\ninquiry into defendant-appellant's complaints against his retained\n\ncounsel and its refusal to appoint new counsel.\n\n     Defendant was indicted for conspiring with two co-defendants\n\nto import cocaine and heroin into the United States in violation of\n\n21 U.S.C. ยง 963 over a two year period, beginning in late 2000.\n\nDefendant's role was to recruit and secure financing for drug\n\ncouriers who would travel in Caribbean cruise ships and transport\n\ndrugs from Curacao in the Netherlands Antilles to St. Thomas, U.S.\n\nVirgin Islands.     Over the period of the conspiracy, defendant was\n\nalleged to have recruited at least ten couples.\n\n     Defendant was indicted on July 31, 2002.     He first refused a\n\ncourt appointed counsel, then employed counsel retained by his\n\nfamily, and finally substituted new retained counsel, Raymond\n\nSanchez-Maceira, at the end of August.    After a plea agreement had\n\nbeen entered into in December, defendant expressed dissatisfaction\n\nwith Sanchez.   Both defendant and Sanchez requested that Sanchez be\n\nallowed to withdraw and that new counsel be appointed.     The court\n\nrefused both requests.    We affirm.\n\n                              The Facts\n\n     The history of the relationship between defendant and Sanchez\n\nis the following:\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f     On December 4, 2002, Sanchez and defendant reviewed a draft\n\nplea agreement, which the government had offered, the offer to\n\nexpire on the following day.   It provided for a plea of guilty to\n\nCount One, defendant to be held accountable for importing at least\n\nfive kilograms but less than fifteen kilograms of cocaine.    It also\n\nreviewed the penalties for the charged crime, the maximum being life\n\nimprisonment and the minimum being ten years.    The government would\n\nrecommend a sentence of one hundred twenty months and a dismissal\n\nof a second count charging possession with intent to distribute.\n\nThe agreement recited that the defendant was satisfied with counsel,\n\nthat he was familiar with the rights he was surrendering, that his\n\nagreement was voluntary, and that he had reviewed every part of the\n\nagreement with his attorney and understood it.    As a result of this\n\noffer for a plea agreement, defendant submitted a motion for change\n\nof plea on December 6.\n\n     On December 12, Attorney Sanchez filed a request to withdraw\n\nas counsel, stating that he had visited defendant several times at\n\nthe Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Guaynabo, discussing the\n\nsentence maximum and minimum for the offense charged and the results\n\nof discovery from the government; that on December 4 he had given\n\ndefendant his appraisal of the plea agreement offered by the\n\ngovernment, and that, in accordance with defendant's instructions,\n\nhe promptly filed a motion to change the plea; that on December 10\n\nSanchez had once again visited the MDC to \"resolve any difference\n\n\n                                -3-\n\fbetween us,\" but defendant refused to see him; and that on the\n\nfollowing day defendant telephoned Sanchez, asking him to withdraw\n\nfrom the case since he had failed to get a \"better\" plea offer. The\n\nmotion concluded that \"a complete breakdown in communication\" had\n\noccurred and requested, in addition to consent to withdraw, an\n\nappropriate inquiry.\n\n      Shortly thereafter, on December 16, the court held a change of\n\nplea hearing.     It began with Sanchez's pointing out his motion to\n\nwithdraw and defendant's unhappiness with the terms of the plea\n\nagreement.   The court addressed the defendant, saying that this was\n\nnot a sufficient ground for allowing Sanchez to withdraw and adding\n\nthat, considering the amount of drugs involved, it could see no\n\nbetter deal than the mandatory minimum of one hundred twenty months.\n\nIn response to the court's query: \"Are we going to have the plea or\n\nare we going to trial?\" defendant disavowed wanting to go to trial.\n\nSanchez intervened at this point, urging that it would be a shame\n\nfor   defendant   to   make   a   straight   plea   in   light   of   the   plea\n\nagreement.   The court allowed a recess for Sanchez and defendant to\n\ntalk.\n\n      On resumption of the hearing, defendant told the court he had\n\nhad enough time to consult with his attorney, that he wished to\n\nenter a plea of guilty to Count One, and that he was satisfied with\n\nhis services.     The court then conducted a careful examination of\n\ndefendant's appreciation of rights waived under the plea agreement\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fand the range of possibilities in sentencing.          Appellant repeated\n\nthat he was satisfied and that his attorney had rendered effective\n\nlegal   assistance.      The   court    concluded   that    he   was   acting\n\n\"voluntarily and with full knowledge of the consequences.\"\n\n       Finally, in January of 2003, defendant filed a pro se motion\n\nto appoint counsel, stating that his family could no longer afford\n\nthe fees Sanchez was charging, that on December 30 and 31 he had\n\ntried unsuccessfully to call Sanchez, that Sanchez had \"deceived\"\n\nhim into signing a plea agreement that was not fully explained to\n\nhim, and that he had lost all confidence in Sanchez.\n\n       The court ordered a response from Sanchez.           On February 14,\n\nSanchez filed his response, which stated that his fee had been fully\n\npaid and that no further fees were being charged; that he had paid\n\nseveral visits to defendant; that he had requested and received\n\nconsiderable discovery; that he had filed a motion to suppress a\n\ntape    and   had   participated   in    a   hearing   to    determine    its\n\nacceptability; that plea negotiations had been complicated by three\n\nfactors - defendant's role, drug amounts, and another case in which\n\nsupervised release might be jeopardized; and that defendant was well\n\naware of the plea provisions and had not been deceived.                Sanchez\n\nadded at the end of his response that the breakdown in communication\n\nbetween him and his client threatened the latter's Sixth Amendment\n\nrights and that new counsel should be appointed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f     On February 26, the court endorsed an order denying the motion\n\nto appoint counsel.\n\n     On    April   3,    2003,    the   court   held    a    sentencing   hearing.\n\nDefendant was present and had no changes to request in the Pre-\n\nsentence Report.        Sanchez urged that special consideration be given\n\ndefendant, since he was vulnerable as a deportable alien.                      The\n\ngovernment argued that there was no basis for downward departure.\n\nThe court asked defendant: \"[I]s there anything you would like to\n\nstate to the court at this time?\"                The defendant declined the\n\ninvitation.    The court then recapitulated the steps leading to the\n\nfinal sentence of one hundred twenty months it felt compelled by the\n\nfacts to impose.\n\n                                    Analysis\n\n     Appellant poses the issue in stark terms: \"Whether the district\n\ncourt committed error when it failed to determine if a conflict of\n\ninterest existed between the appellant and his attorney after\n\nappellant asked his trial attorney to withdraw and requested that\n\nthe court appoint new counsel.\"\n\n     Appellant argues in his brief that he had accused counsel of\n\nfailing properly to represent him and that counsel was forced to\n\ndefend his good name and \"attack his own client and savage his\n\nclient's credibility.\"          Moreover, he asserts that there had been a\n\ncomplete    breakdown      in    communication    and       that   this   situation\n\nindicated an obvious conflict of interest, which, under Cuyler v.\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fSullivan, 446 U.S. 335, 346 (1980), and other cases, requires an\n\ninquiry to resolve the issue.              The district court held no such\n\ninquiry and proceeded to hold the change of plea hearing. This was,\n\nappellant concludes, a per se denial of appellant's Sixth Amendment\n\nrights   and   requires     reversal       without     any    obligation   to   show\n\nprejudice.      Cf. Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 488 (1978)\n\n(\"[W]henever a trial court improperly requires joint representation\n\nover timely objection [to a conflict of interest] reversal is\n\nautomatic.\").\n\n      This proposition, examined closely, is a bold, innovative, and,\n\nfinally, untenable claim.          That is, the alleged conflict consists\n\nof a court-ordered response by an attorney to a client's conclusory\n\nexpressions of dissatisfaction, in which the lawyer detailed his\n\nservices to his client and joined in the request to allow withdrawal\n\nand to appoint new counsel.         The response does not begin to rise to\n\nthe levels of \"attack\" or \"savaging.\"                It was a not uncommon type\n\nof   disagreement    between      client    and      counsel,   exacerbated     by    a\n\nretrospective regret that a more favorable plea agreement could not\n\nsomehow have been made.\n\n      Appellant     seeks   to    stretch      the    concept    of   \"conflict      of\n\ninterests\"     to   cover   the   vast     terrain     of    possible   conflicting\n\nopinions of client and counsel. The existing body of law subjecting\n\nconflict of interests issues to the most scrupulous attention is\n\nbased on the principle that a person cannot faithfully serve two\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fmasters with conflicting interests.          All the case law we are\n\nacquainted with deals with multiple representation situations, with\n\nsituations involving two or more clients of a lawyer.          See, e.g.,\n\nWheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 160 (1988); Sullivan, 446 U.S.\n\nat 346; Halloway, 435 U.S. at 483-84.        Defendant seeks to support\n\nhis claim by citing two First Circuit cases, United States            v.\n\nNelson-Rodriguez, 319 F.3d 12 (2003) and United States v. Hernandez-\n\nLebron, 23 F.3d 600 (1994), but both cases involved multiple or\n\njoint representation of more than one client by a lawyer.\n\n     In Mickens v. Taylor, the Court clarified that Halloway's\n\nautomatic reversal rule applies \"only where defense counsel is\n\nforced to represent codefendants over his timely objection, unless\n\nthe trial court has determined that there is no conflict.\" 535 U.S.\n\n162, 168 (2002).    It also stressed that, in any event, a defendant\n\nmust show a defective, though not necessarily an outcome-affecting,\n\nperformance by counsel.        The Court then referred to courts of\n\nappeals which have applied Sullivan and its obligation to inquire\n\ninto a potential conflict of interest \"even when representation of\n\nthe defendant somehow implicates counsel's personal or financial\n\ninterests.\"     Mickens, 535 U.S. at 174.     The Court added, \"It must\n\nbe said, however, that the language of Sullivan itself does not\n\nclearly   establish,    or   indeed   even   support,   such    expansive\n\napplication.\"    Id. at 175.    It noted that the problem giving rise\n\nto the obligation to inquire was \"the high probability of prejudice\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\farising from multiple concurrent representation, and the difficulty\n\nof proving that prejudice.\" Id.         It added, \"Not all attorney\n\nconflicts present comparable difficulties.\" Id.\n\n     Were disagreements between attorney and client to be treated\n\nin the same manner as conflicts arising from multiple representation\n\nof clients - with resulting possible per se reversal without the\n\nnecessity of proving prejudice - the nature of appeals in criminal\n\ncases would be dramatically altered.       The odds are that many an\n\nunsuccessful defendant would be found nursing some disagreement with\n\ncounsel.\n\n     We therefore refuse appellant's suggestion to treat this as a\n\ncase presenting notice of a potential conflict of interest requiring\n\na special inquiry and the draconian remedy of reversal without a\n\nshowing of prejudice.     But we hasten to recognize that differences\n\nbetween counsel and client can be so deep, pervasive and well-\n\nfounded    that   effective   legal   assistance   has   been   severely\n\nhandicapped.      In such a case a court may well be called upon to\n\ngrant relief.\n\n     In the instant case, there are two actions of the court at\n\nissue: its refusal to allow Sanchez to withdraw and its refusal to\n\nappoint substitute counsel.       Were the only issue that of the\n\nappropriateness of the court's refusal to permit withdrawal, Sanchez\n\nhaving been retained privately, there might be some question.         As\n\nwe said in United States v. Woodard, 291 F.3d 95, 107 (lst Cir.\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f2002), a defendant is not ordinarily dependent on the court's\n\npermission to replace retained counsel.        But here the two actions\n\nmerge, since defendant and his family ran out of funds to retain\n\nother private counsel and defendant sought court appointed counsel.\n\n     In assessing the adequacy of the district court's inquiry under\n\nthese circumstances, we acknowledge that \"The extent and nature of\n\nthe inquiry may vary in each case; it need not amount to a formal\n\nhearing.\"   Id. at 108.   The objectives of the inquiry are those set\n\nforth in United States v. Allen, 789 F.2d 90, 92 (lst Cir. 1986),\n\napplicable to denials of motions to substitute counsel:\n\n     [T]he appellate court should consider several factors,\n     including the timeliness of the motion, the adequacy of\n     the court's inquiry into the defendant's complaint, and\n     whether the conflict between the defendant and his\n     counsel was so great that it resulted in a total lack of\n     communication preventing an adequate defense.\n\nCf. United States v. Reyes, 352 F.3d 511, 514 (lst Cir. 2003);\n\nUnited States v. Genao, 281 F.3d 305, 312 (lst Cir. 2002).\n\n     We set aside the timeliness issue as not having been advanced\n\nas a challenge to appellant.      In reviewing the record, we see,\n\nfirst,   the   initial   reason   for   dissatisfaction,   attributed   to\n\ndefendant by Sanchez, and not denied - that he thought counsel\n\nshould have obtained a more favorable plea agreement offer from the\n\ngovernment.    But it has not been pointed out to us why the district\n\ncourt was in error when it confessed that it saw no more favorable\n\nalternative that could have been offered.       As we said in Genao, 281\n\nF.3d at 313, \"[T]he mere fact that a defense attorney and his client\n\n                                   -10-\n\fdisagreed   about     the    advisability        of    a    plea   does    not   justify\n\nappointing new counsel.\"           We cannot say that Sanchez's advice to\n\nenter into this plea bargain was \"aberrational.\"                        See Allen, 789\n\nF.2d at 92.\n\n      We find ourselves in the same situation as that in Allen: \"Good\n\ncause for substitution of counsel cannot be determined solely\n\naccording      to   the   subjective      standard         of    what   the     defendant\n\nperceives.\"     789 F.3d at 23 (internal quotation marks omitted); see\n\nalso United States v. Beaver, 524 F.2d 963, 965 (5th Cir. 1975)\n\n(finding \"mere subjective lack of confidence\" in defense counsel\n\ndoes not establish insufficiency of counsel within the meaning of\n\nSixth Amendment).\n\n      Defendant also accused Sanchez of deceiving him but advanced\n\nno   details    except      to   claim    that    he       was   not    given    adequate\n\nexplanation of the agreement.            This, however, is belied not only by\n\nthe representations of understanding and satisfaction with counsel\n\ncontained in the plea agreement, but in the subsequent change of\n\nplea hearing where, after a recess to confer with Sanchez, defendant\n\ntwice responded in the affirmative when asked if he was satisfied\n\nwith his attorney's services. In a lengthy colloquy with the court,\n\ndefendant said that he understood the rights he was waiving, and the\n\nimplications of his plea.           Finally, at the end of the sentencing\n\nhearing, when the court asked if defendant had anything he would\n\nlike to say, defendant remained mute.\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\f     Defendant's    final    complaint,     counsel's    unavailability,   is\n\nalleged without any particulars except a failed effort to reach\n\ncounsel on the last two nights of the year.             Countering this, and\n\nnot denied by defendant, is the repeated averment of Sanchez that\n\nhe paid several visits to MDC Guaynabo, engaged in discovery, sought\n\nand obtained a hearing on the admissibility of a tape recording of\n\na telephone conversation, and engaged in difficult negotiations.\n\n      As for defendant's assertion that there was a complete\n\nbreakdown in communication, this was belied at the change of plea\n\nhearing on December 16 when Sanchez intervened at a critical point\n\nwhen it appeared that the court considered the plea agreement\n\nrejected.    He obtained a recess to allow him to confer with his\n\nclient.     Subsequently the defendant once again professed himself\n\nsatisfied.    The plea agreement continued to be the basis of the\n\ncourt's further inquiry.          This indicates to us that there still\n\nremained    the   elements   of    effective   communication,     continuing\n\nvigilance and concern on the part of counsel and trust on the part\n\nof the client.    As we said in United States v. Myers, 294 F.3d 203,\n\n208 (lst Cir. 2002), a defendant \"must show that the conflict\n\nbetween lawyer and client was so profound as to cause a total\n\nbreakdown    in   communication,\"     preventing   an     adequate   defense.\n\nMoreover, to the extent that there was a breakdown, it was the doing\n\nof defendant himself, and, as we said in Reyes, 352 F.3d at 516,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\f\"[A] defendant cannot compel a change to [sic] counsel by the device\n\nof refusing to talk with his lawyer.\"\n\n        Finally, when we consider the ultimate question whether the\n\ndisagreements between lawyer and client were likely to preclude\n\neffective assistance in the defense, we have in mind that the work\n\nof a lawyer for defendant was practically at an end.             Sanchez had\n\nmade   a   vigorous   plea   for   helping   defendant   avoid   deportation\n\nproblems as a result of the sentence in the instant case.             Beyond\n\nthis, there lay presumably only the work of providing services on\n\nappeal - something beyond the scope of the request for substitute\n\ncounsel.\n\n       In short, we think the district court gave adequate attention\n\nto the issues raised by defendant, and made appropriate inquiry into\n\nthe causes and merits of the complaints.         We hold that it was well\n\nwithin its discretion in refusing to appoint new counsel.\n\n       AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\f",

The government would recommend a sentence of one hundred twenty months and a dismissal of a second count charging possession with intent to distribute. The agreement recited that the defendant was satisfied with counsel, that he was familiar with the rights he was surrendering, that his agreement was voluntary, and that he had reviewed every part of the agreement with his attorney and understood it. As a result of this offer for a plea agreement, defendant submitted a motion for change of plea on December 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 12, Attorney Sanchez filed a request to withdraw as counsel, stating that he had visited defendant several times at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Guaynabo, discussing the sentence maximum and minimum for the offense charged and the results of discovery from the government; that on December 4 he had given defendant his appraisal of the plea agreement offered by the government, and that, in accordance with defendant's instructions, he promptly filed a motion to change the plea; that on December 10 Sanchez had once again visited the MDC to \"resolve any difference between us,\" but defendant refused to see him; and that on the following day defendant telephoned Sanchez, asking him to withdraw from the case since he had failed to get a \"better\" plea offer. The motion concluded that \"a complete breakdown in communication\" had occurred and requested, in addition to consent to withdraw, an appropriate inquiry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, on December 16, the court held a change of plea hearing. It began with Sanchez's pointing out his motion to withdraw and defendant's unhappiness with the terms of the plea agreement. The court addressed the defendant, saying that this was not a sufficient ground for allowing Sanchez to withdraw and adding that, considering the amount of drugs involved, it could see no better deal than the mandatory minimum of one hundred twenty months. In response to the court's query: \"Are we going to have the plea or are we going to trial?\" defendant disavowed wanting to go to trial. Sanchez intervened at this point, urging that it would be a shame for defendant to make a straight plea in light of the plea agreement. The court allowed a recess for Sanchez and defendant to talk.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On resumption of the hearing, defendant told the court he had had enough time to consult with his attorney, that he wished to enter a plea of guilty to Count One, and that he was satisfied with his services. The court then conducted a careful examination of defendant's appreciation of rights waived under the plea agreement and the range of possibilities in sentencing. Appellant repeated that he was satisfied and that his attorney had rendered effective legal assistance. The court concluded that he was acting \"voluntarily and with full knowledge of the consequences.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, in January of 2003, defendant filed a pro se motion to appoint counsel, stating that his family could no longer afford the fees Sanchez was charging, that on December 30 and 31 he had tried unsuccessfully to call Sanchez, that Sanchez had \"deceived\" him into signing a plea agreement that was not fully explained to him, and that he had lost all confidence in Sanchez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court ordered a response from Sanchez. On February 14, Sanchez filed his response, which stated that his fee had been fully paid and that no further fees were being charged; that he had paid several visits to defendant; that he had requested and received considerable discovery; that he had filed a motion to suppress a tape and had participated in a hearing to determine its acceptability; that plea negotiations had been complicated by three factors &#8212; defendant's role, drug amounts, and another case in which supervised release might be jeopardized; and that defendant was well aware of the plea provisions and had not been deceived. Sanchez added at the end of his response that the breakdown in communication between him and his client threatened the latter's Sixth Amendment rights and that new counsel should be appointed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 26, the court endorsed an order denying the motion to appoint counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 3, 2003, the court held a sentencing hearing. Defendant was present and had no changes to request in the Pre-sentence Report. Sanchez urged that special consideration be given defendant, since he was vulnerable as a deportable alien. The government argued that there was no basis for downward departure. The court asked defendant: \"[I]s there anything you would like to state to the court at this time?\" The defendant declined the invitation. The court then recapitulated the steps leading to the final sentence of one hundred twenty months it felt compelled by the facts to impose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant poses the issue in stark terms: \"Whether the district court committed error when it failed to determine if a conflict of interest existed between the appellant and his attorney after appellant asked his trial attorney to withdraw and requested that the court appoint new counsel.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues in his brief that he had accused counsel of failing properly to represent him and that counsel was forced to defend his good name and \"attack his own client and savage his client's credibility.\" Moreover, he asserts that there had been a complete breakdown in communication and that this situation indicated an obvious conflict of interest, which, under <i>Cuyler v. Sullivan,</i> 446 U.S. 335, 346, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980), and other cases, requires an inquiry to resolve the issue. The district court held no such inquiry and proceeded to hold the change of plea hearing. This was, appellant concludes, a <i>per se</i> denial of appellant's Sixth Amendment rights and requires reversal without any obligation to show prejudice. <i>Cf. Holloway v. Arkansas,</i> 435 U.S. 475, 488, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 55 L.Ed.2d 426 (1978) (\"[W]henever a trial court improperly requires joint representation over timely objection [to a conflict of interest] reversal is automatic.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This proposition, examined closely, is a bold, innovative, and, finally, untenable claim. That is, the alleged conflict consists of a court-ordered response by an attorney to a client's conclusory expressions of dissatisfaction, in which the lawyer detailed his services to his client and joined in the request to allow withdrawal and to appoint new counsel. The response does not begin to rise to the levels of \"attack\" or \"savaging.\" It was a not uncommon type of disagreement between client and counsel, exacerbated by a retrospective regret that a more favorable plea agreement could not somehow have been made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant seeks to stretch the concept of \"conflict of interests\" to cover the vast terrain of possible conflicting opinions of client and counsel. The existing body of law subjecting conflict of interests issues to the most scrupulous attention is based on the principle that a person cannot faithfully serve two masters with conflicting interests. All the case law we are acquainted with deals with multiple representation situations, with situations involving two or more clients of a lawyer. <i>See, e.g., Wheat v. United States,</i> 486 U.S. 153, 160, 108 S.Ct. 1692, 100 L.Ed.2d 140 (1988); <i>Sullivan,</i> 446 U.S. at 346, 100 S.Ct. 1708; <i>Holloway,</i> 435 U.S. at 483-84, 98 S.Ct. 1173. Defendant seeks to support his claim by citing two First Circuit cases, <i>United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> 319 F.3d 12 (2003) and <i>United States v. Hernandez-Lebron,</i> 23 F.3d 600 (1994), but both cases involved multiple or joint representation of more than one client by a lawyer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Mickens v. Taylor,</i> the Court clarified that <i>Holloway's</i> automatic reversal rule applies \"only where defense counsel is forced to represent codefendants over his timely objection, unless the trial court has determined that there is no conflict.\" 535 U.S. 162, 168, 122 S.Ct. 1237, 152 L.Ed.2d 291 (2002). It also stressed that, in any event, a defendant must show a defective, though not necessarily an outcome-affecting, performance by counsel. The Court then referred to courts of appeals which have applied <i>Sullivan</i> and its obligation to inquire into a potential conflict of interest \"even when representation of the defendant somehow implicates counsel's personal or financial interests.\" <i>Mickens,</i> 535 U.S. at 174, 122 S.Ct. 1237. The Court added, \"It must be said, however, that the language of <i>Sullivan</i> itself does not clearly establish, or indeed even support, such expansive application.\" <i>Id.</i> at 175, 122 S.Ct. 1237. It noted that the problem giving rise to the obligation to inquire was \"the high probability of prejudice arising from multiple concurrent representation, and the difficulty of proving that prejudice.\" <i>Id.</i> It added, \"Not all attorney conflicts present comparable difficulties.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were disagreements between attorney and client to be treated in the same manner as conflicts arising from multiple representation of clients &#8212; with resulting possible <i>per se</i> reversal without the necessity of proving prejudice &#8212; the nature of appeals in criminal cases would be dramatically altered. The odds are that many an unsuccessful defendant would be found nursing some disagreement with counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore refuse appellant's suggestion to treat this as a case presenting notice of a potential conflict of interest requiring a special inquiry and the draconian remedy of reversal without a showing of prejudice. But we hasten to recognize that differences between counsel and client can be so deep, pervasive and well-founded that effective legal assistance has been severely handicapped. In such a case a court may well be called upon to grant relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, there are two actions of the court at issue: its refusal to allow Sanchez to withdraw and its refusal to appoint substitute counsel. Were the only issue that of the appropriateness of the court's refusal to permit withdrawal, Sanchez having been retained privately, there might be some question. As we said in <i>United States v. Woodard,</i> 291 F.3d 95, 107 (1st Cir.2002), a defendant is not ordinarily dependent on the court's permission to replace retained counsel. But here the two actions merge, since defendant and his family ran out of funds to retain other private counsel and defendant sought court appointed counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing the adequacy of the district court's inquiry under these circumstances, we acknowledge that \"The extent and nature of the inquiry may vary in each case; it need not amount to a formal hearing.\" <i>Id.</i> at 108. The objectives of the inquiry are those set forth in <i>United States v. Allen,</i> 789 F.2d 90, 92 (1st Cir.1986), applicable to denials of motions to substitute counsel:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he appellate court should consider several factors, including the timeliness of the motion, the adequacy of the court's inquiry into the defendant's complaint, and whether the conflict between the defendant and his counsel was so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Cf. United States v. Reyes,</i> 352 F.3d 511, 514 (1st Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Genao,</i> 281 F.3d 305, 312 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set aside the timeliness issue as not having been advanced as a challenge to appellant. In reviewing the record, we see, first, the initial reason for dissatisfaction, attributed to defendant by Sanchez, and not denied &#8212; that he thought counsel should have obtained a more favorable plea agreement offer from the government. But it has not been pointed out to us why the district court was in error when it confessed that it saw no more favorable alternative that could have been offered. As we said in <i>Genao,</i> 281 F.3d at 313, \"[T]he mere fact that a defense attorney and his client disagreed about the advisability of a plea does not justify appointing new counsel.\" We cannot say that Sanchez's advice to enter into this plea bargain was \"aberrational.\" <i>See Allen,</i> 789 F.2d at 92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find ourselves in the same situation as that in <i>Allen:</i> \"Good cause for substitution of counsel cannot be determined solely according to the subjective standard of what the defendant perceives.\" 789 F.2d at 93 (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also United States v. Beaver,</i> 524 F.2d 963, 965 (5th Cir.1975) (finding \"mere subjective lack of confidence\" in defense counsel does not establish insufficiency of counsel within the meaning of Sixth Amendment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also accused Sanchez of deceiving him but advanced no details except to claim that he was not given adequate explanation of the agreement. This, however, is belied not only by the representations of understanding and satisfaction with counsel contained in the plea agreement, but in the subsequent change of plea hearing where, after a recess to confer with Sanchez, defendant twice responded in the affirmative when asked if he was satisfied with his attorney's services. In a lengthy colloquy with the court, defendant said that he understood the rights he was waiving, and the implications of his plea. Finally, at the end of the sentencing hearing, when the court asked if defendant had anything he would like to say, defendant remained mute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's final complaint, counsel's unavailability, is alleged without any particulars except a failed effort to reach counsel on the last two nights of the year. Countering this, and not denied by defendant, is the repeated averment of Sanchez that he paid several visits to MDC Guaynabo, engaged in discovery, sought and obtained a hearing on the admissibility of a tape recording of a telephone conversation, and engaged in difficult negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for defendant's assertion that there was a complete breakdown in communication, this was belied at the change of plea hearing on December 16 when Sanchez intervened at a critical point when it appeared that the court considered the plea agreement rejected. He obtained a recess to allow him to confer with his client. Subsequently the defendant once again professed himself satisfied. The plea agreement continued to be the basis of the court's further inquiry. This indicates to us that there still remained the elements of effective communication, continuing vigilance and concern on the part of counsel and trust on the part of the client. As we said in <i>United States v. Myers,</i> 294 F.3d 203, 208 (1st Cir.2002), a defendant \"must show that the conflict between lawyer and client was so profound as to cause a total breakdown in communication,\" preventing an adequate defense. Moreover, to the extent that there was a breakdown, it was the doing of defendant himself, and, as we said in <i>Reyes,</i> 352 F.3d at 516, \"[A] defendant cannot compel a change to [sic] counsel by the device of refusing to talk with his lawyer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, when we consider the ultimate question whether the disagreements between lawyer and client were likely to preclude effective assistance in the defense, we have in mind that the work of a lawyer for defendant was practically at an end. Sanchez had made a vigorous plea for helping defendant avoid deportation problems as a result of the sentence in the instant case. Beyond this, there lay presumably only the work of providing services on appeal &#8212; something beyond the scope of the request for substitute counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, we think the district court gave adequate attention to the issues raised by defendant, and made appropriate inquiry into the causes and merits of the complaints. We hold that it was well within its discretion in refusing to appoint new counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>AFFIRMED.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Defendant's role was to recruit and secure financing for drug couriers who would travel in Caribbean cruise ships and transport drugs from Curacao in the Netherlands Antilles to St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands. Over the period of the conspiracy, defendant was alleged to have recruited at least ten couples.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant was indicted on July 31, 2002. He first refused a court appointed counsel, then employed counsel retained by his family, and finally substituted new retained counsel, Raymond Sanchez-Maceira, at the end of August. After a plea agreement had been entered into in December, defendant expressed dissatisfaction with Sanchez. Both defendant and Sanchez requested that Sanchez be allowed to withdraw and that new counsel be appointed. The court refused both requests.

It also reviewed the penalties for the charged crime, the maximum being life imprisonment and the minimum being ten years.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">426</span></a></span> (1978) (\"[W]henever a trial court improperly requires joint representation over timely objection [to a conflict of interest] reversal is automatic.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This proposition, examined closely, is a bold, innovative, and, finally, untenable claim. That is, the alleged conflict consists of a court-ordered response by an attorney to a client's conclusory expressions of dissatisfaction, in which the lawyer detailed his services to his client and joined in the request to allow withdrawal and to appoint new counsel. The response does not begin to rise to the levels of \"attack\" or \"savaging.\" It was a not uncommon type of disagreement between client and counsel, exacerbated by a retrospective regret that a more favorable plea agreement could not somehow have been made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant seeks to stretch the concept of \"conflict of interests\" to cover the vast terrain of possible conflicting opinions of client and counsel. The existing body of law subjecting conflict of interests issues to the most scrupulous attention is based on the principle that a person cannot faithfully serve two masters with conflicting interests. All the case law we are acquainted with deals with multiple representation situations, with situations involving two or more clients of a lawyer. <i>See, e.g., Wheat v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112074\"><a href=\"/opinion/112074/wheat-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">153</span></a></span>, 160, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112074\"><a href=\"/opinion/112074/wheat-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1173</span></a></span>. Defendant seeks to support his claim by citing two First Circuit cases, <i>United States v. Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"780802\"><a href=\"/opinion/780802/united-states-v-milton-a-nelson-rodriguez-luis-a-romero-lopez-miguel-a/\"><span class=\"volume\">319</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span> (2003) and <i>United States v. Hernandez-Lebron,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195375\"><a href=\"/opinion/195375/united-states-v-hernandez-lebron/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span> (1994), but both cases involved multiple or joint representation of more than one client by a lawyer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Mickens v. Taylor,</i> the Court clarified that <i>Holloway's</i> automatic reversal rule applies \"only where defense counsel is forced to represent codefendants over his timely objection, unless the trial court has determined that there is no conflict.\" <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118492\"><a href=\"/opinion/118492/mickens-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">162</span></a></span>, 168, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118492\"><a href=\"/opinion/118492/mickens-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118492\"><a href=\"/opinion/118492/mickens-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">291</span></a></span> (2002). It also stressed that, in any event, a defendant must show a defective, though not necessarily an outcome-affecting, performance by counsel. The Court then referred to courts of appeals which have applied <i>Sullivan</i> and its obligation to inquire into a potential conflict of interest \"even when representation of the defendant somehow implicates counsel's personal or financial interests.\" <i>Mickens,</i> 535 U.S. at 174, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118492\"><a href=\"/opinion/118492/mickens-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span>. The Court added, \"It must be said, however, that the language of <i>Sullivan</i> itself does not clearly establish, or indeed even support, such expansive application.\" <i>Id.</i> at 175, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118492\"><a href=\"/opinion/118492/mickens-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1237</span></a></span>. It noted that the problem giving rise to the obligation to inquire was \"the high probability of prejudice arising from multiple concurrent representation, and the difficulty of proving that prejudice.\" <i>Id.</i> It added, \"Not all attorney conflicts present comparable difficulties.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Were disagreements between attorney and client to be treated in the same manner as conflicts arising from multiple representation of clients &#8212; with resulting possible <i>per se</i> reversal without the necessity of proving prejudice &#8212; the nature of appeals in criminal cases would be dramatically altered. The odds are that many an unsuccessful defendant would be found nursing some disagreement with counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore refuse appellant's suggestion to treat this as a case presenting notice of a potential conflict of interest requiring a special inquiry and the draconian remedy of reversal without a showing of prejudice. But we hasten to recognize that differences between counsel and client can be so deep, pervasive and well-founded that effective legal assistance has been severely handicapped. In such a case a court may well be called upon to grant relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, there are two actions of the court at issue: its refusal to allow Sanchez to withdraw and its refusal to appoint substitute counsel. Were the only issue that of the appropriateness of the court's refusal to permit withdrawal, Sanchez having been retained privately, there might be some question. As we said in <i>United States v. Woodard,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199979\"><a href=\"/opinion/199979/united-states-v-woodard/\"><span class=\"volume\">291</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></a></span>, 107 (1st Cir.2002), a defendant is not ordinarily dependent on the court's permission to replace retained counsel. But here the two actions merge, since defendant and his family ran out of funds to retain other private counsel and defendant sought court appointed counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing the adequacy of the district court's inquiry under these circumstances, we acknowledge that \"The extent and nature of the inquiry may vary in each case; it need not amount to a formal hearing.\" <i>Id.</i> at 108. The objectives of the inquiry are those set forth in <i>United States v. Allen,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"469060\"><a href=\"/opinion/469060/united-states-v-norman-c-allen/\"><span class=\"volume\">789</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></a></span>, 92 (1st Cir.1986), applicable to denials of motions to substitute counsel:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[T]he appellate court should consider several factors, including the timeliness of the motion, the adequacy of the court's inquiry into the defendant's complaint, and whether the conflict between the defendant and his counsel was so great that it resulted in a total lack of communication preventing an adequate defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Cf. United States v. Reyes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200778\"><a href=\"/opinion/200778/united-states-v-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 514 (1st Cir.2003); <i>United States v. Genao,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199851\"><a href=\"/opinion/199851/united-states-v-genao/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">305</span></a></span>, 312 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We set aside the timeliness issue as not having been advanced as a challenge to appellant. In reviewing the record, we see, first, the initial reason for dissatisfaction, attributed to defendant by Sanchez, and not denied &#8212; that he thought counsel should have obtained a more favorable plea agreement offer from the government. But it has not been pointed out to us why the district court was in error when it confessed that it saw no more favorable alternative that could have been offered. As we said in <i>Genao,</i> 281 F.3d at 313, \"[T]he mere fact that a defense attorney and his client disagreed about the advisability of a plea does not justify appointing new counsel.\" We cannot say that Sanchez's advice to enter into this plea bargain was \"aberrational.\" <i>See Allen,</i> 789 F.2d at 92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find ourselves in the same situation as that in <i>Allen:</i> \"Good cause for substitution of counsel cannot be determined solely according to the subjective standard of what the defendant perceives.\" 789 F.2d at 93 (internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see also United States v. Beaver,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"330753\"><a href=\"/opinion/330753/united-states-v-howard-james-beaver/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">963</span></a></span>, 965 (5th Cir.1975) (finding \"mere subjective lack of confidence\" in defense counsel does not establish insufficiency of counsel within the meaning of Sixth Amendment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also accused Sanchez of deceiving him but advanced no details except to claim that he was not given adequate explanation of the agreement. This, however, is belied not only by the representations of understanding and satisfaction with counsel contained in the plea agreement, but in the subsequent change of plea hearing where, after a recess to confer with Sanchez, defendant twice responded in the affirmative when asked if he was satisfied with his attorney's services. In a lengthy colloquy with the court, defendant said that he understood the rights he was waiving, and the implications of his plea. Finally, at the end of the sentencing hearing, when the court asked if defendant had anything he would like to say, defendant remained mute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's final complaint, counsel's unavailability, is alleged without any particulars except a failed effort to reach counsel on the last two nights of the year. Countering this, and not denied by defendant, is the repeated averment of Sanchez that he paid several visits to MDC Guaynabo, engaged in discovery, sought and obtained a hearing on the admissibility of a tape recording of a telephone conversation, and engaged in difficult negotiations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for defendant's assertion that there was a complete breakdown in communication, this was belied at the change of plea hearing on December 16 when Sanchez intervened at a critical point when it appeared that the court considered the plea agreement rejected. He obtained a recess to allow him to confer with his client. Subsequently the defendant once again professed himself satisfied. The plea agreement continued to be the basis of the court's further inquiry. This indicates to us that there still remained the elements of effective communication, continuing vigilance and concern on the part of counsel and trust on the part of the client. As we said in <i>United States v. Myers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200055\"><a href=\"/opinion/200055/united-states-v-myers/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">203</span></a></span>, 208 (1st Cir.2002), a defendant \"must show that the conflict between lawyer and client was so profound as to cause a total breakdown in communication,\" preventing an adequate defense. Moreover, to the extent that there was a breakdown, it was the doing of defendant himself, and, as we said in <i>Reyes,</i> 352 F.3d at 516, \"[A] defendant cannot compel a change to [sic] counsel by the device of refusing to talk with his lawyer.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, when we consider the ultimate question whether the disagreements between lawyer and client were likely to preclude effective assistance in the defense, we have in mind that the work of a lawyer for defendant was practically at an end. Sanchez had made a vigorous plea for helping defendant avoid deportation problems as a result of the sentence in the instant case. Beyond this, there lay presumably only the work of providing services on appeal &#8212; something beyond the scope of the request for substitute counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In short, we think the district court gave adequate attention to the issues raised by defendant, and made appropriate inquiry into the causes and merits of the complaints. We hold that it was well within its discretion in refusing to appoint new counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>AFFIRMED.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    ",
