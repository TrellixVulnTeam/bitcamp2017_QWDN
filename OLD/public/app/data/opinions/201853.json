Jaime Pieras, Jr., Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n                          *\n            Torruella, Dyk , and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n          Jesús E.

Puerto Rico Telephone Company,\n\nInc. (“PRTC”) appeals from the district court’s denial of its\n\nmotion to vacate and entry of judgment confirming an arbitral\n\naward.    The award granted $2.5 million in damages to U.S. Phone\n\nManufacturing Corp. (“USPhone”) for breach of contract.        At issue\n\nis whether and how parties can contract for standards of judicial\n\nreview of arbitration awards other than those set forth in the\n\nFederal Arbitration Act (“FAA” or “Act”).         9 U.S.C. §§ 10, 11\n\n(2000).\n\n            We hold that the judicial review provisions of the FAA\n\ncan be displaced only by explicit contractual language evincing\n\nthe parties’ clear intent to subject the arbitration award to a\n\ndifferent standard of review.      Here, no such clear statement was\n\ncontained in the contract. Under the proper review standard set\n\nforth in the FAA there were no grounds for vacating the award.\n\nWe accordingly affirm the district court.       On the cross-appeal by\n\nUSPhone, we also affirm the district court’s decision to deny an\n\naward of attorneys’ fees to USPhone.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            The present dispute had its genesis in 1987, when PRTC\n\nsolicited    bids   to   procure   telephones   for   its   residential\n\ncustomers over a five-year period.       USPhone was awarded the bid,\n\njointly with two other companies, on February 10, 1988.              On\n\n                                   -2-\n\fDecember       2,   1988,   PRTC   and   USPhone    executed     a    requirements\n\ncontract under which USPhone agreed to supply PRTC’s five-year\n\nrequirements        of   residential     memory    telephones,       estimated   at\n\n25,000 per year (“the contract”).              The contract was drafted by\n\nPRTC.        Clause 4 of the contract, titled “Language and Law,”\n\ncontained a provision stating that “[t]his Contract shall be\n\ngoverned by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico.”1            Clause 17, titled “Arbitration”,\n\nstated, in pertinent part:\n\n\n            17.2     Arbitration Panel\n\n                     If an attempt at settlement has failed, the\n                     disputes shall be finally settled under the\n                     Rules of Conciliation and Arbitration of the\n                     American Arbitration Association.\n                     Each Party shall appoint a member to a three-\n                     person panel.   The two members so appointed\n                     shall within twenty (20) days agree upon a\n                     third member who shall be a jurist and chair\n                     the panel.     If the two members fail to\n                     appoint the third member within thirty (30)\n                     days, he will be appointed by the President\n                     of the American Arbitration Association. The\n                     panel shall meet in Puerto Rico and apply the\n                     law of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n\n            17.3    Judgment\n\n                    The arbitral award shall be substantiated in\n                    writing and the findings shall be final and\n        1\n     Clause 4 also stated “[t]his Contract is drawn up in the\nEnglish language, which shall govern and shall be designated as the\n‘Ruling Language.’”\n                                         -3-\n\f                   binding for both parties.  This arbitration\n                   procedure shall be a condition precedent to\n                   any right of legal action.  The panel shall\n                   decide on the matter of costs of the\n                   arbitration.\n\n             During      the    course    of     performance,        various    disputes\n\narose between the parties, which they were unable to resolve.\n\nThe contract was eventually terminated by PRTC, pursuant to the\n\ncontract’s termination clause, effective January 2, 1993.                               On\n\nSeptember 13, 1993, USPhone commenced arbitration against PRTC,\n\nbefore the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”).                        Three years\n\nlater,   following       various       procedural    skirmishes        regarding       the\n\nchoice of a neutral arbitrator, the United States District Court\n\nfor the District of Puerto Rico ordered the parties to proceed to\n\narbitration.        U.S. Phone Mfg. Corp. v. P.R. Tel. Co., Civ. No.\n\n96-1265CCC, slip op. at 5 (D.P.R. Sept. 30, 1996).\n\n            An AAA panel was convened in June 1997 and spent over\n\ntwo years considering the matter.                 More than a decade after the\n\ninitial request for arbitration, on March 4, 2003, a unanimous\n\npanel    awarded       USPhone       $2,552,123.99     in      damages      basing     its\n\ndecision     on    a    record       including     “approximately          10   days    of\n\ntestimony . . . 1900 pages of transcripts, and approximately 175\n\nexhibits,    including         physical    evidence,      as    well     as     documents\n\ncomprising        approximately        1700     pages.”         As    is      common    in\n\narbitration       awards,      the     arbitrators’       decision       contained      no\n\n                                          -4-\n\fdiscussion of the arbitrators’ reasoning. See, e.g., Raytheon Co.\n\nv. Automated Bus. Sys., Inc., 882 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\n             On June 2, 2003, PRTC filed a motion to vacate the\n\narbitration award in the United States District Court for the\n\ndistrict    of    Puerto   Rico.      The       motion   did   not   challenge     the\n\narbitrability of any aspect of the controversy.                      However, PRTC\n\nclaimed    that    the   limited    FAA    standard      of    judicial   review    of\n\nawards    was     inapplicable     and    that     the   contract    provided      for\n\njudicial review of all errors of law in the arbitration award.\n\nThe   motion     alleged   “various       errors    in   the    structure   of     the\n\narbitration, the procedures of the arbitration, and the ultimate\n\nfindings of the arbitration.” P.R. Tel. Co. v. U.S. Phone Mfg.\n\nCorp., Nos. 03-1593, 03-1815, slip op. at 1 (D.P.R. Mar. 9,\n\n2004).     The case was consolidated with an earlier action brought\n\nby USPhone in the Southern District of New York for confirmation\n\nof the award pursuant to the FAA.\n\n             The district court denied PRTC’s motion to vacate,\n\nholding that the FAA review standards applied.                        The district\n\ncourt concluded that under the FAA standard, judicial review of\n\narbitral awards is “only allowed in cases of corruption, serious\n\nerror, misconduct, and miscalculation,” and that “district courts\n\ndo not have the luxury ‘to hear claims of factual or legal error\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fby   an    arbitrator    as   an    appellate    court   does     in    reviewing\n\ndecisions of lower courts.’” Id., slip op. at 2 (quoting United\n\nPaperworkers Int’l Union v. Misco, Inc., 484 U.S. 29, 38 (1987)).\n\n              The district court found that PRTC’s challenge to the\n\naward did “not rise to anywhere near the level required under the\n\nFederal Arbitration Act in order to allow court review ... [and]\n\nthat      PRTC’s   objections      to   the   arbitration   are        essentially\n\ndisagreements with the arbitrators’ conclusions.”               Id., slip op.\n\nat 3.      In denying PRTC’s motion, the court further observed that\n\n“[t]he mere filing of this motion controverts the purpose of the\n\nFederal Arbitration Act and is a waste of the time and resources\n\nof this Court.”         Id., slip op. at 4.        Subsequently, the court\n\ngranted USPhone’s motion to amend the judgment, nunc pro tunc, to\n\nreflect confirmation of the award.            In this same order, the court\n\ndenied U.S. Phone’s request for attorneys’ fees but granted pre-\n\njudgment and post-judgment interest on the award.               P.R. Tel. Co.\n\nv. U.S. Phone Mfg. Corp., Nos. 03-1593, 03-1815, slip op. at 2-3\n\n(D.P.R. Oct. 6, 2004).\n\n              PRTC appeals the denial of its motion to vacate and\n\nthe judgment confirming the award.               USPhone cross-appeals the\n\ndenial of attorneys’ fees. We have jurisdiction pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1291.       We review the district court decision upholding\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fthe arbitration award under “ordinary, not special, standards.”\n\nFirst Options of Chi., Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 948 (1995).2\n\n        II.   The Appropriate Standard of Judicial Review\n\n          On appeal, the parties agree that this contract is\n\ngoverned by the FAA.   They also agree that the FAA provides for\n\nvery limited review of an arbitration award.    Section 10 permits\n\ncourts to vacate an award only:\n\n          (1) Where the award was procured by corruption,\n          fraud, or undue means.\n\n\n2\n           USPhone argues that PRTC’s motion to vacate the\narbitration award was untimely. Section 12 of the FAA provides:\n“Notice of a motion to vacate ... an award must be served upon the\nadverse party or his attorney within three months after the award\nis filed or delivered.” 9 U.S.C. § 12 (2000). The FAA requires\nservice on nonresidents \"in like manner as other process of the\ncourt\" and refers to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil\nProcedure. Wright & Miller, 4A Fed. Prac. & Proc. Civ. 3d § 1101\n(2002). Here, PRTC served its motion to vacate on USPhone and its\ncounsel by mail at least four times prior to the deadline, and was\nable to effect personal service on USPhone on June 5, 2003, one day\nafter the deadline.\n     We need not decide whether mail service complied with Rule 4\nin these circumstances, for courts have held that a failure to\ncomply with Rule 4 (for example, by serving only the defendant's\nattorney) may be excused if notice actually is received. Id.\nUSPhone does not deny receipt of actual notice during the three\nmonth window, nor allege any significant prejudice. The district\ncourt was within its discretion to excuse the one-day delay. See\nPiccolo v. Dain, Kalman & Quail, Inc., 641 F.2d 598, 601 (8th Cir.\n1981) (recognizing a “due diligence” exception to the three-month\nlimit); see also Petrol Shipping Corp. v. Kingdom of Greece,\nMinistry of Comm., Purchase Directorate 360 F.2d 103, 107-08 (2nd\nCir. 1966); Matter of Arbitration between InterCarbon Bermuda, Ltd.\nand Caltex Trading and Transp. Corp., 146 F.R.D. 64, 71 (S.D.N.Y.\n1993).\n                                  -7-\n\f            (2) Where there was evident partiality or\n            corruption in the arbitrators, or either of\n            them.\n            (3) Where the arbitrators were guilty of\n            misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing,\n            upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to\n            hear evidence pertinent and material to the\n            controversy; or of any other misbehavior by\n            which the rights of any party have been\n            prejudiced.\n            (4) Where the arbitrators exceeded their powers,\n            or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual,\n            final, and definite award upon the subject\n            matter submitted was not made.\n\n9 U.S.C. § 10 (2000).3           Thus, the statute \"carefully limits\n\njudicial intervention to instances where the arbitration has been\n\ntainted in certain specific ways ... [and] contains no express\n\nground upon which an award can be overturned because it rests on\n\ngarden-variety    factual   or    legal    [errors].\"      Advest,   Inc.   v.\n\nMcCarthy,     914 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir. 1990).            Under the FAA, an\n\naward may be vacated for legal error only when in “manifest\n\ndisregard   of   the   law.”     Wonderland    Greyhound    Park,    Inc.   v.\n\nAutotote Sys., Inc., 274 F.3d 34, 35-36 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            However, PRTC contends that the parties contracted for\n\nmore rigorous review of arbitration awards than that provided for\n\nby the FAA.      In particular, PRTC asserts that the contract, by\n     3\n          Section 11, not relevant here, provides the district\ncourt with authority to “make an order modifying or correcting” an\narbitration award in cases of “evident material miscalculation of\nfigures or an evident material mistake ...[;] [w]here the\narbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submitted to them ...[;]\n[or] [w]here the award is imperfect in matter of form not affecting\nthe merits of the controversy.” 9 U.S.C. § 11 (2000).\n                                     -8-\n\fadopting Puerto Rican law and by providing that the “contract\n\nshall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws\n\nof the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico” (language which they claim,\n\nunder Puerto Rican law, requires review of the award for legal\n\nerrors), demonstrates that the parties agreed to judicial review\n\nof the award for errors of law. Resolution of this question\n\nrequires examination of the FAA and case law interpreting it.\n\n                A.   Background and Purpose of the FAA\n\n           The FAA was enacted in 1925, 43 Stat. 883, and then\n\nreenacted and codified in 1947 as Title 9 of the United States\n\nCode.     The   Act’s   “purpose   was   to   reverse   the   longstanding\n\njudicial hostility to arbitration agreements that had existed at\n\nEnglish common law and had been adopted by American courts, and\n\nto place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other\n\ncontracts.”     Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp., 500 U.S.\n\n20, 24 (1991); see also Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson, 513\n\nU.S. 265, 270 (1995) (FAA’s purpose was to “overcome courts’\n\nrefusals to enforce agreements to arbitrate”).           The FAA broadly\n\nprovides that written agreements to arbitrate “involving commerce\n\n... shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.” 9 U.S.C. §            2\n\n(2000).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f                Under the Act, federal courts may, inter alia, stay\n\nlitigation on issues that are within the scope of the arbitration\n\nagreement, 9 U.S.C. § 3; compel parties to submit to arbitration,\n\n9 U.S.C. § 4; appoint neutral arbitrators, 9 U.S.C. § 5; compel\n\nappearances of witnesses at arbitration hearings, 9 U.S.C. § 7;\n\nconfirm    arbitration       awards    and   enter     judgment       accordingly;     9\n\nU.S.C.     §     9;   and,      as   discussed       above,     in     very    limited\n\ncircumstances, vacate, modify, or correct arbitration awards, 9\n\nU.S.C. §§ 10 & 11.\n\n                In light of the FAA’s explicit purpose to override\n\nstate     law    that     impedes     the    enforceability          of   arbitration\n\nagreements, it is well established that the provisions of the FAA\n\nwill prevail over contrary state-law rules.                   The “broad principle\n\nof enforceability” of arbitration agreements embodied in the Act\n\nis not subject “to any additional limitations under state law.”\n\nSouthland Corp. v. Keating, 465 U.S. 1, 11 (1984).                        The Supreme\n\nCourt     has    repeatedly      enforced      the    federal     policy       favoring\n\narbitration       where   the    controversy     concerns       the    scope    of   the\n\narbitration clause itself.\n\n                For example, in Perry v. Thomas, the Court held that\n\ndisputes over commissions on securities sales were arbitrable\n\nunder a contract that provided for arbitration, even though the\n\nCalifornia Labor Code mandated court litigation of such \"wage\"\n\n                                        -10-\n\fdisputes, \"despite the existence of an agreement to arbitrate.\"\n\n482 U.S. 483, 486, 490-91 (1986).              This was because section 2 of\n\nthe    FAA    \"embodies      a     clear    federal      policy    of     requiring\n\narbitration”        where    there    is    an     enforceable     agreement      to\n\narbitrate.          Id. at 489.      Similarly, in Mitsubishi Motors Corp.\n\nv.    Soler   Chrysler-Plymouth,        Inc.,      the   Court    held    that   the\n\nparties' antitrust claims were arbitrable, notwitstanding Puerto\n\nRican law requiring judicial resolution. 473 U.S. 614, 623 n.10\n\n(1985).\n\n              The    Court   has     also   held    that   the    federal    policy\n\nfavoring arbitration and reflected in the FAA “establishes that,\n\nas a matter of federal law, any doubts concerning the scope of\n\narbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.”\n\nMoses H. Cone Mem. Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. 1,\n\n24-25 (1983).         This is so “whether the problem at hand is the\n\nconstruction of the contract language itself or an allegation of\n\nwaiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability.”                      Id. at 25;\n\nSee also Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood & Conklin Mfg.

Bd. of Trs. of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489\n\nU.S. 468, 475-76 (1989).\n\n            A   difficulty        has     arisen,     however,     when      another\n\nimportant policy in the FAA has been implicated – namely the\n\nfederal    policy   of    allowing       the   parties    to   craft   their      own\n\nagreements.     Passage      of    the    FAA    \"was    motivated,    first      and\n\nforemost, by a congressional desire to enforce agreements into\n\nwhich parties had entered.\"             Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd,\n\n470 U.S. 213, 220 (1985).          The general rule is that arbitration\n\nagreements are to be enforced according to their terms.                        Volt,\n\n489 U.S. at 479;     Prima Paint, 388 U.S. at 404 n.12.\n\n            These   two    policies       contained     within   the   FAA    –   the\n\npolicy favoring arbitral resolution of disputes notwithstanding\n\nstate law to the contrary, and the policy favoring enforcement of\n\narbitration agreements according to general contract principles –\n\nare potentially in conflict in two situations.                 First, choice-of-\n\nlaw   provisions    in    arbitration      contracts      (providing      that    the\n\ncontract will be governed by the law of a particular state) have\n\nbeen argued to evidence the parties’ desire that arbitration be\n\nconducted pursuant to state law.               Second, even where federal law\n\ngoverns,   where    an    arbitration      agreement      adopts   a   particular\n\narbitration rule that departs from the FAA standard (either a\n\nstate-law rule or one created for the particular agreement),\n\n                                        -12-\n\fthere    is    an     argument         that    the     agreement     should       be    enforced\n\naccording to its terms, and that the specific rule chosen by the\n\nparties should prevail over the FAA standard.                                Here, we must\n\nfirst    determine        whether       state       or    federal    law    applies      to    the\n\nstandard      of    review        issue       and    then   determine       if    the    federal\n\nstandard of the FAA has been displaced.\n\n                    B.    Effect of the Choice-of-Law Clause\n\n                We consider first the choice-of-law argument.                                  PRTC\n\nargues that by incorporating Puerto Rican law the parties agreed\n\nthat    the    Puerto      Rican       law     of    judicial     review     of    arbitration\n\nawards    should         apply.        The     Supreme      Court    has    considered          the\n\nchoice-of-law         issue       in    the     Volt      and   Mastrobuono        cases,       and\n\nappears to have instructed us that the outcome should depend on\n\nwhether       there      is   a    significant            FAA   policy      that       would     be\n\nundermined by the state rule.\n\n                Mastrobuono involved a policy central to the FAA: the\n\nallocation       of    powers      between          the   court     and    the    arbitrators.\n\nMastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc., 514 U.S. 52, 59-60\n\n(1995).       The Court held that a choice-of-law provision could not\n\nbe interpreted to substitute state for federal law.                                Id. at 58-\n\n61.       The       petitioners          in     Mastrobuono         were    unsophisticated\n\ninvestors who had opened a securities trading account with a\n\n\n                                                -13-\n\flarge brokerage firm.        Id. at 54.          The contract, drafted in full\n\nby the brokerage firm, contained an arbitration clause providing\n\nfor arbitration in accordance with the National Association of\n\nSecurities Dealers (\"NASD\") rules.                  These rules allowed an award\n\nof punitive damages.        Id. at 60-61.           The contract also included a\n\nchoice-of-law clause stating that the contract was to be governed\n\nby    New   York   law.     Id.    at   54-55.          New   York   law     prohibited\n\narbitrators from awarding punitive damages.                    Id. at 55.\n\n               In light of the federal policy favoring arbitration,\n\nthe    Court    concluded    that       the     \"best    way    to       harmonize     the\n\nchoice-of-law provision with the arbitration provision [was] to\n\nread ‘the laws of the State of New York’ to encompass substantive\n\nprinciples that New York courts would apply, but not to include\n\nspecial rules limiting the authority of arbitrators.                          Thus, the\n\nchoice-of-law      provision      covers      the    rights    and       duties   of   the\n\nparties, while the arbitration clause covers arbitration.\"                             Id.\n\nat    63-64    (emphasis   added).       In     other    words,      a    choice-of-law\n\nclause, standing alone, generally will not be interpreted to\n\nrequire the application of state law restricting “the authority\n\nof arbitrators.”\n\n               Volt, on the other hand, held that a choice-of-law\n\nprovision could properly be interpreted by the state court to\n\nprovide for application of California law as to the relative\n\n                                         -14-\n\ftiming of judicial and arbitration proceedings.               489 U.S. at 479.\n\nThere,     the   contract    provided      that   “[t]he   contract     shall   be\n\ngoverned by the law of the place where the Project is located,”\n\nthat is, California.           Id. at 470 (modification in original).\n\nCalifornia law provided that an arbitration should be stayed\n\npending     related   litigation      by    one    of   the   parties    to     the\n\narbitration agreement with parties not bound by the arbitration\n\nagreement.       There was no provision of the FAA either requiring a\n\nstay of arbitration in such circumstances or prohibiting a stay.4\n\nThe Supreme Court, deferring to the state court’s interpretation\n\nof   the    contract,       found   that    the    federal    policy    favoring\n\n     4\n          Section 3 of the FAA states:\n     If any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of\n     the United States upon any issue referable to arbitration\n     under an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court\n     in which such suit is pending, upon being satisfied that the\n     issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to\n     arbitration under such an agreement, shall on application of\n     one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such\n     arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the\n     agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is not in\n     default in proceeding with such arbitration.\n9 U.S.C. § 3 (2000).      This provision has been interpreted to\nrequire a stay of litigation between the parties to the arbitration\nagreement when the subject of the litigation is within the scope of\nthe agreement. See e.g., Moses H. Cone, 460 U.S. at 22, 22 n.27.\nSection 3 does not directly address the issue of stays of\nlitigation involving non-parties.      Other courts have broadly\ninterpreted section 3 -- in combination with the district court’s\ninherent power to manage its own docket -- to authorize the\ndistrict court to issue a stay of litigation involving non-parties.\nSee, e.g., City of Bismarck v. Toltz, King, Duvall, 767 F.2d 429,\n432-33 (8th Cir. 1985).\n                                -15-\n\farbitration was not offended by application of California’s laws\n\nbecause, “[t]here is no federal policy favoring arbitration under\n\na certain set of procedural rules.\"                  Volt, 489 U.S. at 476.              More\n\nrecently, the Court has clarified that the proper inquiry is\n\nwhether the state law requirement “undermine[s] the goals and\n\npolicies of the FAA,” Doctor’s Assocs. v. Cassaroto, 517 U.S.\n\n681, 685 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted), and explained\n\nthat   “[t]he     state   rule    examined        in    Volt    determined        only    the\n\nefficient order of proceedings.”                  Id. at 688 (emphasis added).\n\nThus, Volt establishes that application of state law rules is\n\nappropriate only when there is no conflicting federal policy.\n\n             We conclude that this case is closer to Mastrobuono\n\nthan   to    Volt,     because     here,    the        policies       of    the   FAA     are\n\nimplicated.       Here, PRTC argues that the choice-of-law provision\n\nrequires us to apply Puerto Rican law to determine whether the\n\ncontract     requires      more     searching          judicial        review      of     the\n\narbitration       award   than    that     provided       for    in    the    FAA.        The\n\nextremely limited judicial review contemplated by the FAA clearly\n\nimplicates      the    federal     policy    favoring          final       resolution     of\n\ndisputes     by      arbitration     and,       in      particular,         affects       the\n\nallocation      of    powers   between      the      court     and    the    arbitrators.\n\nMastrobuono, 514 U.S. at 59-60.             Allowing more searching judicial\n\nreview   would       inherently    limit     the       authority       of    arbitrators.\n\n                                         -16-\n\fJacada Ltd. v. Intern. Mktg. Strategies, 401 F.3d 701, 711 (6th\n\nCir. 2005); see also Bowen v. Amoco Pipeline Co., 254 F.3d 925,\n\n936 (10th Cir. 2001) (\"[E]xpanded judicial review would threaten\n\nthe   independence     of     arbitration      ...    and     reduces      arbitrors'\n\nwillingness     to   create      particularized       solutions      for    fear    the\n\ndecision will be vacated by a reviewing court.\").\n\n           In    light      of   this   policy,      the    mere    inclusion      of    a\n\ngeneric choice-of-law clause within the arbitration agreement is\n\nnot sufficient to require the application of state law concerning\n\nthe scope of review, since there is a strong federal policy\n\nrequiring limited review.          This is particularly so when the state\n\nlaw   at   issue     is     “specifically      and         solely    applicable         to\n\narbitration agreements.”          Painewebber Inc. v. Elahi, 87 F.3d 589,\n\n593 (1st Cir. 1996).        Just as the generic choice-of-law clause in\n\nMastrobuono was insufficient to invoke New York law precluding\n\narbitrators’ awards of punitive damages, a “generic choice-of-law\n\nclause, standing alone, is insufficient to support a finding that\n\ncontracting parties intended to opt out of the FAA’s default\n\nregime” for vacatur of arbitral awards.                     Roadway Package Sys.,\n\nInc. v. Kayser, 257 F.3d 287, 289, 297 (3rd Cir. 2001).\n\n           Our conclusion in this respect is in keeping with the\n\ndecisions of every circuit that has considered the question.\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fThese other circuits have held that the mere inclusion of a\n\nchoice-of-law   clause   within    the   arbitration   agreement   is\n\ninsufficient to indicate the parties’ intent to contract for the\n\napplication of state law concerning judicial review of awards.5\n\n          Thus, here the choice-of-law provision in Clause 4 of\n\nthe contract is insufficient to render applicable Puerto Rican\n\nlaw concerning the scope of judicial review.\n\n     5\n          See, e.g., Jacada, 401 F.3d at 711-12 (holding that\ngeneric choice-of-law provision did “not unequivocally suggest an\nintent to displace the default federal standard”); Roadway, 257\nF.3d at 289; UHC Mgmt. Co. v. Computer Scis.

See, e.g., Elahi,\n87 F.3d at 593 (following Mastrobuono to “find that the choice-of\nlaw clause in this case is not an expression of intent to adopt New\nYork caselaw requiring the courts to apply section 15 [the NASD\ntime bar on arbitration]”); Sec.

Effect of Other Provisions\n\n           PRTC argues, however, that, even applying federal law,\n\nthe contract should be read as evidencing an explicit decision to\n\nprovide for more searching judicial review.                     Specifically, it\n\nurges that the language of Clause 4 of the contract is not merely\n\na choice-of-law clause because it provides that “[t]his Contract\n\nshall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws\n\nof the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.”              Under Puerto Rican law, if\n\nthe   parties’   arbitration          agreement   specifies     that     the   award\n\nshould be “conformable to law” (“conforme al derecho”), then the\n\naward will be reviewed for legal error.                  See, e.g., Unión de la\n\nIndustria Licorera de Ponce v. Destilería Serrallés. Inc., 116\n\nP.R. Offic. Trans. 426, 432 (P.R. 1985); S.I. U. De Puerto Rico\n\nv. Otis Elevator Co., 105 P.R. Offic. Trans. 1156, 1163 (P.R.\n\n1977); see also Febus v. MARPE, 135 D.P.R. 206 (1994). PRTC\n\nargues   that    the       “in   accordance       with    the    laws”    language\n\ndemonstrates     an   intent     to    subject    the    arbitrators’     award   to\n\nreview for errors of law.         USPhone, on the other hand,            urges the\n\nlanguage here is insufficient under Puerto Rican law to invoke\n\nreview for legal error, and that the contract itself explicitly\n\nprovides that the findings of the arbitrator “shall be final and\n\nbinding for both parties,” thus precluding more searching review.\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\f          We need not decide whether as a matter of local law\n\nthis contract would be construed as providing for review of legal\n\nerror, for we conclude that the FAA creates a presumption that\n\nthe more limited FAA standard will govern, and the language here,\n\nas a matter of federal law, is insufficient to overcome the\n\npresumption.\n\n          The issue whether the parties by contract can supplant\n\nthe FAA standard of review has generated substantial litigation.\n\nSome circuits that have held that parties can never by contract\n\nagree to a different standard of review, holding that \"because\n\nCongress has specified the exclusive standard by which federal\n\ncourts may review an arbitrator's decision ... private parties\n\nmay not contractually impose their own standard on the courts.\"\n\nKyocera Corp. v. Prudential-Bache Trade Servs., Inc., 341 F.3d\n\n987, 994 (9th Cir. 2003) (en banc); Bowen, 254 F.3d at 935.6\n\n          These   cases   construe   the   FAA   to   preclude   such   a\n\ncontractual provision on the theory that allowing private parties\n\nto contract for more searching review standards would create\n     6\n          The Eighth Circuit has also suggested that it would not\nallow parties to contract for expanded judicial review, although it\ndid not finally decide the issue, finding the contract language at\nissue insufficient to indicate the parties’ intent to do so. See\nUHC Mgmt. Co., 148 F.3d at 996-97.      The Seventh Circuit, in a\ndecision construing section 301 of the Taft-Hartley Act but\n“looking to” the FAA for guidance has also suggested that parties\ncannot contract for vacatur standards other than those set forth in\nthe FAA. Chi. Typographical Union No. 16 v. Chi. Sun-Times, Inc.,\n935 F.2d 1501, 1504-05 (7th Cir. 1991).\n                                -20-\n\ffederal         jurisdiction   by    contract.

This\n\nconcern seems to us misplaced, as it is well settled that federal\n\ncourts have jurisdiction over suits seeking to compel arbitration\n\n(or to vacate or enforce arbitration awards) only if the parties\n\nare        of    diverse    citizenship,       or     some    separate      grant       of\n\njurisdiction applies.7              Modifying the review standard does not\n\nexpand federal jurisdiction.\n\n                 These decisions also rest on a policy concern that\n\n\"[b]road         judicial   review    of   arbitration       decisions     could      well\n\njeopardize the very benefits of arbitration, rendering informal\n\narbitration         merely     a     prelude     to    a     more    cumbersome        and\n\ntime-consuming judicial review process.\"                     Kyocera, 341 F.3d at\n\n998; accord Bowen, 254 F.3d at 935.                   These cases invoke the goal\n\nof    preserving      the    “independence     of     the    arbitration     process,”\n\nBowen, 254 F.3d at 935, or, put otherwise, the independence of\n\nthe arbitrators.\n\n                 However, the Supreme Court has emphasized on more than\n\none occasion that the principal objective behind the passage of\n\n       7\n          The FAA is “something of an anomaly in the field of\nfederal-court jurisdiction.     It creates a body of federal\nsubstantive law establishing and regulating the duty to honor an\nagreement to arbitrate, yet it does not create any independent\nfederal-question jurisdiction under [28 U.S.C. § 1331 (2000)] or\notherwise.\" Moses H.

See, e.g., Jacada, 401 F.3d a\n\nRoadway, 257 F.3d at 288-89; Gateway Techs., Inc. v. MCI, 64 F.3d\n\n993, 996-97 (5th Cir. 1995).               These courts have held that the\n\nAct’s ultimate purpose is to enforce the terms of the agreement\n\nto arbitrate, and that they are therefore bound by federal law to\n\nenforce    the    arbitration      agreements       as    drafted.           See,   e.g.,\n\nRoadway, 257 F.3d at 292.           At the same time they have recognized\n\nthat the federal policy in favor of recognizing broad authority\n\nof   the   arbitrators,     even     if    not    sufficient          to    override   the\n\nparties’ agreement for more searching review, at least requires a\n\npresumption that the FAA standard will apply.

Thus,\n\nin   the   few    cases   where     courts       have    found    that      the   parties\n\ncontracted for more searching judicial review of arbitral awards,\n\nthere has been explicit contractual language that specified the\n\n                                          -22-\n\fprecise       nature       of    the   intended        judicial      review.        See,     e.g.,\n\nGateway Techs., 64 F.3d at 996 (contract language stated that\n\n“[t]he arbitration decision shall be final and binding on both\n\nparties,       except           that   errors         of    law    shall     be     subject     to\n\nappeal”)(emphasis and modification in original); Harris v. Parker\n\nColl.    of    Chiropractic,             286    F.3d       790,   793-94    (5th    Cir.     2002)\n\n(contract expressly provided that “each party shall retain his\n\nright to appeal any questions of law”).\n\n               We agree with the other circuits that have concluded\n\nthat the parties can by contract displace the FAA standard of\n\nreview,       but    that       displacement          can    be   achieved       only   by   clear\n\ncontractual language.                    The contract here, even if sufficient\n\nunder Puerto Rican law, is far short of the explicit language\n\nrequired by federal law to displace the FAA standard of review,\n\nparticularly         in     light      of      the    agreement’s        language       that   any\n\ndisputes “shall be finally settled” under the AAA Rules.                                       See\n\nElahi,    87    F.3d       at     594.         We    conclude     that     the    FAA   standard\n\napplies.\n\n                    III.    Interpreting the Governing Standard\n\n               PRTC        contends         that,          even   applying        the    federal\n\nstandard, the award should be set aside.                             As we noted earlier,\n\nunder the FAA itself, “judicial review of arbitration awards is\n\n\n                                                    -23-\n\favailable where arbitrators have acted in manifest disregard of\n\nthe law.”         Prudential-Bache Secs., Inc. v. Tanner, 72 F.3d 234,\n\n239 (1st Cir. 1995) (citing Wilko v. Swan, 346 U.S. 427, 436-37\n\n(1953)).         Thus, “a mere mistake of law by an arbitrator cannot\n\nserve as the basis for judicial review.”                        Id. at 239 n.6.\n\nRather, “manifest disregard” means that “arbitrators knew the law\n\nand explicitly disregarded it.”                Advest, 914 F.2d at 10.         Vacatur\n\nis appropriate under the manifest disregard standard only when\n\nthe    award      is    “‘unfounded    in   reason      and   fact,   ...    based    on\n\nreasoning so palpably faulty that no judge or group of judges\n\ncould ever conceivably have made such a ruling, or is mistakenly\n\nbased on a crucial assumption which is decidedly a non-fact.’”\n\nChallenger Caribbean Corp. v.

Put    differently,       “disregard\n\nimplies      that      the    arbitrators   appreciated       the   existence    of    a\n\ngoverning legal rule but wilfully decided not to apply it.                            As\n\narbitrators need not explain their award, and did not do so here,\n\nit is no wonder that appellant is hard pressed to satisfy the\n\nexacting criteria for invocation of the doctrine.”                      Advest, 914\n\nF.2d at 10 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).8\n\n       8\n          “‘[A]s long as the arbitrator is even arguably constru-\ning or applying the contract and acting within the scope of his\nauthority,' a court's conviction that the arbitrator made a serious\nmistake or committed grevious error will not furnish a satisfactory\n                               -24-\n\f               This standard has not remotely been satisfied here.\n\nPRTC contends that the arbitrators failed to recognize various\n\nbreaches    of      cardinal    contractual       obligations     by     USPhone   that\n\nprovided a defense to USPhone’s claims for breach of contract.\n\nThus, for example, USPhone allegedly violated the contract by\n\nfailing    to    comply      with    applicable      FCC   requirements.        PRTC’s\n\nargument that the district court failed to review the arbitration\n\naward    under      the    “manifest     disregard    of    the   law    standard”   is\n\nnothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to obtain appellate\n\nreview    of     the      arbitrators’    legal    and     factual      determinations\n\nregarding the contract dispute.                   The district court properly\n\nrejected PRTC’s claim, finding that “PRTC’s objections to the\n\narbitration are essentially disagreements with the arbitrators’\n\nconclusions.”          P.R.

Attorneys’ Fees\n\n               In      its   cross-appeal,        USPhone     contends      that     the\n\ndistrict court erred in refusing to award attorneys’ fees, in\n\nlight of various observations made by the district court when\n\ndismissing with PRTC’s motion with prejudice.9                    Our review of the\n\nbasis for undoing the decision,” under the manifest disregard\nstandard. Advest, 914 F.2d at 9 (quoting Misco, 484 U.S. at 371).\n9\n          Specifically, USPhone cites to the following language\nfrom the district court’s Opinion and Order:\n     The Court finds that the basis for review stated by PRTC\n     in this case does not rise to anywhere near the level\n                               -25-\n\fdistrict          court’s    denial          of    attorney       fees   is    for    abuse   of\n\ndiscretion.         Top Entm’t, Inc. v. Torrejon, 351 F.3d 531, 533 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).\n\n                  Puerto Rican law, which governs the question of fees\n\nin this diversity action, see Newell P.R., Ltd. v. Rubbermaid\n\nInc., 20 F.3d 15, 24 (1st Cir. 1994), provides that “[i]n the\n\nevent       any     party    or        its        lawyer    has     acted     obstinately     or\n\nfrivolously, the court shall, in its judgment, impose on such\n\nperson the payment of a sum for attorney’s fees which the court\n\ndecides corresponds to such conduct.”                             P.R. R. Civ. P. 44.1(d).\n\nPuerto Rican law thus provides that an award of fees shall be\n\nmade        for    either        (1)    obstinate           conduct      or   (2)      frivolous\n\nlitigation.           There is no basis for USPhone’s contention that\n\nfederal law requires a more liberal standard for the award of\n\nattorney’s          fees    in    suits           seeking    to    set   aside       arbitration\n\nawards.10\n\n     required under the Federal Arbitration Act in order to\n     allow court review.       The Court finds that PRTC’s\n     objections   to    the   arbitration   are    essentially\n     disagreements with the arbitrators’ conclusions. This\n     type of disagreement cannot form the basis of a\n     legitimate motion to vacate an arbitration award because\n     it would subvert the very purpose of arbitration. ...\n     The mere filing of this motion controverts the purpose of\n     the Federal Arbitration Act and is a waste of the time\n     and resources of this Court.”\nP.R.

The district court acted within\n\nits discretion in denying USPhone's motion for the award of fees.\n\n                                           V.\n\n            In sum, we hold that the parties did not by contract\n\ndisplace the FAA standard of review and, under the FAA standard,\n\nthe    district   court     properly       denied    the    motion    to   vacate    and\n\nconfirmed the arbitration award.

The award granted $2.5 million in damages to U.S. Phone Manufacturing Corp. (\"USPhone\") for breach of contract. At issue is whether and how parties can contract for standards of judicial review of arbitration awards other than those set forth in the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\" or \"Act\"). 9 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 10, 11 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the judicial review provisions of the FAA can be displaced only by explicit contractual language evincing the parties' clear intent to subject the arbitration award to a different standard of review.

USPhone was awarded the bid, jointly with two other companies, on February 10, 1988. On December 2, 1988, PRTC and USPhone executed a requirements contract under which USPhone agreed to supply PRTC's five-year requirements of residential memory telephones, estimated at 25,000 per year (\"the contract\"). The contract was drafted by PRTC.

Section 10 permits courts to vacate an award only:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) Where there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of them.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(3) Where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the rights of any party have been prejudiced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(4) Where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was not made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9 U.S.C. &#167; 10 (2000).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Thus, the statute \"carefully limits judicial intervention to instances where the arbitration has been tainted in certain specific ways ... [and] contains no express ground upon which an award can be overturned because it rests on garden-variety factual or legal [errors].\" <i>Advest, Inc. v. McCarthy,</i> 914 F.2d 6, 8 (1st Cir.1990). Under the FAA, an award may be vacated for legal error only when in \"manifest disregard of the law.\" <i>Wonderland Greyhound Park, Inc. v.

In particular, PRTC asserts that the contract, by adopting Puerto Rican law and by providing that the \"contract shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\" (language which they claim, under Puerto Rican law, requires review of the award for legal errors), demonstrates that the parties agreed to judicial review of the award for errors of law. Resolution of this question requires examination of the FAA and case law interpreting it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Background and Purpose of the FAA</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The FAA was enacted in 1925, 43 Stat. 883, and then reenacted and codified in 1947 as Title 9 of the United States Code. The Act's \"purpose was to reverse the longstanding judicial hostility to arbitration agreements that had existed at English common law and had been adopted by American courts, and to place arbitration agreements upon the same footing as other contracts.\" <i>Gilmer v. Interstate/Johnson Lane Corp.,</i> 500 U.S. 20, 24, 111 S.Ct. 1647, 114 L.Ed.2d 26 (1991); <i>see also Allied-Bruce Terminix Cos. v. Dobson,</i> 513 U.S. 265, 270, 115 S.Ct. 834, 130 L.Ed.2d 753 (1995) (FAA's purpose was to \"overcome courts' refusals to enforce agreements to arbitrate\"). The FAA broadly provides that written agreements to arbitrate \"involving commerce ... shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable.\" 9 U.S.C. &#167; 2 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the Act, federal courts may, <i>inter alia,</i> stay litigation on issues that are within the scope of the arbitration agreement, 9 U.S.C. &#167; 3; compel parties to submit to arbitration, 9 U.S.C. &#167; 4; appoint neutral arbitrators, 9 U.S.C. &#167; 5; compel appearances of witnesses at arbitration hearings, 9 U.S.C. &#167; 7; confirm arbitration awards and enter judgment accordingly; 9 U.S.C. &#167; 9; and, as discussed above, in very limited circumstances, vacate, modify, or correct arbitration awards, 9 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 10 &amp; 11.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the FAA's explicit purpose to override state law that impedes the enforceability of arbitration agreements, it is well established that the provisions of the FAA will prevail over contrary state-law rules. The \"broad principle of enforceability\" of arbitration agreements embodied in the Act is not subject \"to any additional limitations under state law.\" <i>Southland Corp. v. Keating,</i> 465 U.S. 1, 11, 104 S.Ct. 852, 79 L.Ed.2d 1 (1984). The Supreme Court has repeatedly enforced the federal policy favoring arbitration where the controversy concerns the scope of the arbitration clause itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, in <i>Perry v. Thomas,</i> the Court held that disputes over commissions on securities sales were arbitrable under a contract that provided for arbitration, even though the California Labor Code mandated court litigation of such \"wage\" disputes, \"despite the existence of an agreement to arbitrate.\" 482 U.S. 483, 486, 490-91, 107 S.Ct. 2520, 96 L.Ed.2d 426 (1986). This was because section 2 of the FAA \"embodies a clear federal policy of requiring arbitration\" where there is an enforceable agreement to arbitrate. <i>Id.</i> at 489, 107 S.Ct. 2520. Similarly, in <i>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,</i> the Court held that the parties' antitrust claims were arbitrable, notwitstanding Puerto Rican law requiring judicial resolution. 473 U.S. 614, 623 n. 10, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court has also held that the federal policy favoring arbitration and reflected in the FAA \"establishes that, as a matter of federal law, any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration.\" <i>Moses H. Cone Mem. Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp.,</i> 460 U.S. 1, 24-25, 103 S.Ct. 927, 74 L.Ed.2d 765 (1983). This is so \"whether the problem at hand is the construction of the contract language itself or an allegation of waiver, delay, or a like defense to arbitrability.\" <i>Id.</i> at 25, 103 S.Ct. 927; <i>See also Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.,</i> 388 U.S. 395, 400, 87 S.Ct. 1801, 18 L.Ed.2d 1270 (1967) (holding that notwithstanding a contrary state rule, consideration of a claim of fraud in the inducement of a contract \"is for the arbitrators and not for the courts\"); <i>Volt Info. Scis. v. Bd. of Trs. of Leland Stanford Junior Univ.,</i> 489 U.S. 468, 475-76, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 103 L.Ed.2d 488 (1989).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A difficulty has arisen, however, when another important policy in the FAA has been implicated &#8212; namely the federal policy of allowing the parties to craft their own agreements. Passage of the FAA \"was motivated, first and foremost, by a congressional desire to enforce agreements into which parties had entered.\" <i>Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc. v. Byrd,</i> 470 U.S. 213, 220, 105 S.Ct. 1238, 84 L.Ed.2d 158 (1985). The general rule is that arbitration agreements are to be enforced according to their terms. <i>Volt,</i> 489 U.S. at 479, 109 S.Ct. 1248; <i>Prima Paint,</i> 388 U.S. at 404 n. 12, 87 S.Ct. 1801.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These two policies contained within the FAA &#8212; the policy favoring arbitral resolution of disputes notwithstanding state law to the contrary, and the policy favoring enforcement of arbitration agreements according to general contract principles &#8212; are potentially in conflict in two situations. First, choice-of-law provisions in arbitration contracts (providing that the contract will be governed by the law of a particular state) have been argued to evidence the parties' desire that arbitration be conducted pursuant to state law. Second, even where federal law governs, where an arbitration agreement adopts a particular arbitration rule that departs from the FAA standard (either a state-law rule or one created for the particular agreement), there is an argument that the agreement should be enforced according to its terms, and that the specific rule chosen by the parties should prevail over the FAA standard. Here, we must first determine whether state or federal law applies to the standard of review issue and then determine if the federal standard of the FAA has been displaced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Effect of the Choice-of-Law Clause</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider first the choice-of-law argument. PRTC argues that by incorporating Puerto Rican law the parties agreed that the Puerto Rican law of judicial review of arbitration awards should apply. The Supreme Court has considered the choice-of-law issue in the <i>Volt</i> and <i>Mastrobuono</i> cases, and appears to have instructed us that the outcome should depend on whether there is a significant FAA policy that would be undermined by the state rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Mastrobuono</i> involved a policy central to the FAA: the allocation of powers between the court and the arbitrators. <i>Mastrobuono v. Shearson Lehman Hutton, Inc.,</i> 514 U.S. 52, 59-60, 115 S.Ct. 1212, 131 L.Ed.2d 76 (1995). The Court held that a choice-of-law provision could not be interpreted to substitute state for federal law. <i>Id.</i> at 58-61, 115 S.Ct. 1212. The petitioners in <i>Mastrobuono</i> were unsophisticated investors who had opened a securities trading account with a large brokerage firm. <i>Id.</i> at 54, 115 S.Ct. 1212. The contract, drafted in full by the brokerage firm, contained an arbitration clause providing for arbitration in accordance with the National Association of Securities Dealers (\"NASD\") rules. These rules allowed an award of punitive damages. <i>Id.</i> at 60-61, 115 S.Ct. 1212. The contract also included a choice-of-law clause stating that the contract was to be governed by New York law. <i>Id.</i> at 54-55, 115 S.Ct. 1212. New York law prohibited arbitrators from awarding punitive damages. <i>Id.</i> at 55, 115 S.Ct. 1212.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of the federal policy favoring arbitration, the Court concluded that the \"best way to harmonize the choice-of-law provision with the arbitration provision [was] to read `the laws of the State of New York' to encompass substantive principles that New York courts would apply, <i>but not to include special rules limiting the authority of arbitrators.</i> Thus, the choice-of-law provision covers the rights and duties of the parties, while the arbitration clause covers arbitration.\" <i>Id.</i> at 63-64, 115 S.Ct. 1212 (emphasis added). In other words, a choice-of-law clause, standing alone, generally will not be interpreted to require the application of state law restricting \"the authority of arbitrators.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Volt,</i> on the other hand, held that a choice-of-law provision could properly be interpreted by the state court to provide for application of California law as to the relative timing of judicial and arbitration proceedings. 489 U.S. at 479, 109 S.Ct. 1248. There, the contract provided that \"[t]he contract shall be governed by the law of the place where the Project is located,\" that is, California. <i>Id.</i> at 470, 109 S.Ct. 1248 (modification in original). California law provided that an arbitration should be stayed pending related litigation by one of the parties to the arbitration agreement with parties not bound by the arbitration agreement. There was no provision of the FAA either requiring a stay of arbitration in such circumstances or prohibiting a stay.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The Supreme Court, deferring to the state court's interpretation of the contract, found that the federal policy favoring arbitration was not offended by application of California's laws because, \"[t]here is no federal policy favoring arbitration under a certain set of procedural rules.\" <i>Volt,</i> 489 U.S. at 476, 109 S.Ct. 1248. More recently, the Court has clarified that the proper inquiry is whether the state law requirement \"undermine[s] the goals and policies of the FAA,\" <i>Doctor's Assocs. v. Casarotto,</i> 517 U.S. 681, 685, 116 S.Ct. 1652, 134 L.Ed.2d 902 (1996) (internal quotation marks omitted), and explained that \"[t]he state rule examined in <i>Volt</i> determined <i>only</i> the efficient order of proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 688, 116 S.Ct. 1652 (emphasis added). Thus, <i>Volt</i> establishes that application of state law rules is appropriate only when there is no conflicting federal policy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We conclude that this case is closer to <i>Mastrobuono</i> than to <i>Volt,</i> because here, the policies of the FAA are implicated. Here, PRTC argues that the choice-of-law provision requires us to apply Puerto Rican law to determine whether the contract requires more searching judicial review of the arbitration award than that provided for in the FAA. The extremely limited judicial review contemplated by the FAA clearly implicates the federal policy favoring final resolution of disputes by arbitration and, in particular, affects the allocation of powers between the court and the arbitrators. <i>Mastrobuono,</i> 514 U.S. at 59-60, 115 S.Ct. 1212. Allowing more searching judicial review would inherently limit the authority of arbitrators. <i>Jacada Ltd. v. Intern. Mktg. Strategies,</i> 401 F.3d 701, 711 (6th Cir.2005); <i>see also Bowen v. Amoco Pipeline Co.,</i> 254 F.3d 925, 936 (10th Cir.2001) (\"[E]xpanded judicial review would threaten the independence of arbitration ... and reduces arbitrors' willingness to create particularized solutions for fear the decision will be vacated by a reviewing court.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In light of this policy, the mere inclusion of a generic choice-of-law clause within the arbitration agreement is not sufficient to require the application of state law concerning the scope of review, since there is a strong federal policy requiring limited review. This is particularly so when the state law at issue is \"specifically and solely applicable to arbitration agreements.\" <i>PaineWebber Inc. v. Elahi,</i> 87 F.3d 589, 593 (1st Cir.1996). Just as the generic choice-of-law clause in <i>Mastrobuono</i> was insufficient to invoke New York law precluding arbitrators' awards of punitive damages, a \"generic choice-of-law clause, standing alone, is insufficient to support a finding that contracting parties intended to opt out of the FAA's default regime\" for vacatur of arbitral awards. <i>Roadway Package Sys., Inc. v. Kayser,</i> 257 F.3d 287, 289, 297 (3rd Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion in this respect is in keeping with the decisions of every circuit that has considered the question. These other circuits have held that the mere inclusion of a choice-of-law clause within the arbitration agreement is insufficient to indicate the parties' intent to contract for the application of state law concerning judicial review of awards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, here the choice-of-law provision in Clause 4 of the contract is insufficient to render applicable Puerto Rican law concerning the scope of judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Effect of Other Provisions</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PRTC argues, however, that, even applying federal law, the contract should be read as evidencing an explicit decision to provide for more searching judicial review. Specifically, it urges that the language of Clause 4 of the contract is not merely a choice-of-law clause because it provides that \"[t]his Contract shall be governed by and interpreted <i>in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</i>\" Under Puerto Rican law, if the parties' arbitration agreement specifies that the award should be \"conformable to law\" (\"conforme al derecho\"), then the award will be reviewed for legal error. <i>See, e.g., Uni&#243;n de la Industria Licorera de Ponce v. Destiler&#237;a Serrall&#233;s. Inc.,</i> 116 P.R. Offic. Trans. 426, 432 (P.R.1985); <i>S.I. U. De Puerto Rico v. Otis Elevator Co.,</i> 105 P.R. Offic. Trans. 1156, 1163 (P.R.1977); <i>see also Febus v. MARPE,</i> 135 D.P.R. 206 (1994). PRTC argues that the \"in accordance with the laws\" language demonstrates an intent to subject the arbitrators' award to review for errors of law. USPhone, on the other hand, urges the language here is insufficient under Puerto Rican law to invoke review for legal error, and that the contract itself explicitly provides that the findings of the arbitrator \"shall be final and binding for both parties,\" thus precluding more searching review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether as a matter of local law this contract would be construed as providing for review of legal error, for we conclude that the FAA creates a presumption that the more limited FAA standard will govern, and the language here, as a matter of federal law, is insufficient to overcome the presumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue whether the parties by contract can supplant the FAA standard of review has generated substantial litigation. Some circuits that have held that parties can never by contract agree to a different standard of review, holding that \"because Congress has specified the exclusive standard by which federal courts may review an arbitrator's decision ... private parties may not contractually impose their own standard on the courts.\" <i>Kyocera Corp. v. Prudential-Bache Trade Servs., Inc.,</i> 341 F.3d 987, 994 (9th Cir.2003) (<i>en banc</i>); <i>Bowen,</i> 254 F.3d at 935.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These cases construe the FAA to preclude such a contractual provision on the theory that allowing private parties to contract for more searching review standards would create federal jurisdiction by contract. <i>Kyocera,</i> 341 F.3d at 999 (citing <i>Chi. Typographical Union,</i> 935 F.2d at 1504-05). This concern seems to us misplaced, as it is well settled that federal courts have jurisdiction over suits seeking to compel arbitration (or to vacate or enforce arbitration awards) only if the parties are of diverse citizenship, or some separate grant of jurisdiction applies.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Modifying the review standard does not expand federal jurisdiction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These decisions also rest on a policy concern that \"[b]road judicial review of arbitration decisions could well jeopardize the very benefits of arbitration, rendering informal arbitration merely a prelude to a more cumbersome and time-consuming judicial review process.\" <i>Kyocera,</i> 341 F.3d at 998; <i>accord Bowen,</i> 254 F.3d at 935. These cases invoke the goal of preserving the \"independence of the arbitration process,\" <i>Bowen,</i> 254 F.3d at 935, or, put otherwise, the independence of the arbitrators.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, the Supreme Court has emphasized on more than one occasion that the principal objective behind the passage of the FAA was enforcement of the parties' agreements, and that efficient dispute resolution should not be favored over the FAA's primary goal of enforcing private agreements to arbitrate, given Congress's \"preeminent concern in passing the Act ... to enforce private agreements.\" <i>Dean Witter Reynolds,</i> 470 U.S. at 221, 105 S.Ct. 1238; <i>see also Moses H. Cone,</i> 460 U.S. at 20, 103 S.Ct. 927 (FAA \"requires piecemeal resolution when necessary to give effect to an arbitration agreement\") (emphasis omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other circuits have held that the parties may contract to displace the FAA standards. <i>See, e.g., Jacada,</i> 401 F.3d 701 a <i>Roadway,</i> 257 F.3d at 288-89; <i>Gateway Techs., Inc. v. MCI,</i> 64 F.3d 993, 996-97 (5th Cir.1995). These courts have held that the Act's ultimate purpose is to enforce the terms of the agreement to arbitrate, and that they are therefore bound by federal law to enforce the arbitration agreements as drafted. <i>See, e.g., Roadway,</i> 257 F.3d at 292. At the same time they have recognized that the federal policy in favor of recognizing broad authority of the arbitrators, even if not sufficient to override the parties' agreement for more searching review, at least requires a presumption that the FAA standard will apply. <i>Id.</i> at 294. Thus, in the few cases where courts have found that the parties contracted for more searching judicial review of arbitral awards, there has been explicit contractual language that specified the precise nature of the intended judicial review. <i>See, e.g., Gateway Techs.,</i> 64 F.3d at 996 (contract language stated that \"[t]he arbitration decision shall be final and binding on both parties, except that <i>errors of law shall be subject to appeal</i>\")(emphasis and modification in original); <i>Harris v. Parker Coll. of Chiropractic,</i> 286 F.3d 790, 793-94 (5th Cir.2002) (contract expressly provided that \"each party shall retain his right to appeal any questions of law\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the other circuits that have concluded that the parties can by contract displace the FAA standard of review, but that displacement can be achieved only by clear contractual language. The contract here, even if sufficient under Puerto Rican law, is far short of the explicit language required by federal law to displace the FAA standard of review, particularly in light of the agreement's language that any disputes \"shall be finally settled\" under the AAA Rules. <i>See Elahi,</i> 87 F.3d at 594. We conclude that the FAA standard applies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. Interpreting the Governing Standard</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PRTC contends that, even applying the federal standard, the award should be set aside. As we noted earlier, under the FAA itself, \"judicial review of arbitration awards is available where arbitrators have acted in manifest disregard of the law.\" <i>Prudential-Bache Secs., Inc. v. Tanner,</i> 72 F.3d 234, 239 (1st Cir.1995) (citing <i>Wilko v. Swan,</i> 346 U.S. 427, 436-37, 74 S.Ct. 182, 98 L.Ed. 168 (1953)). Thus, \"a mere mistake of law by an arbitrator cannot serve as the basis for judicial review.\" <i>Id.</i> at 239 n. 6. Rather, \"manifest disregard\" means that \"arbitrators knew the law and explicitly disregarded it.\" <i>Advest,</i> 914 F.2d at 10. Vacatur is appropriate under the manifest disregard standard only when the award is \"`unfounded in reason and fact, ... based on reasoning so palpably faulty that no judge or group of judges could ever conceivably have made such a ruling, or is mistakenly based on a crucial assumption which is decidedly a non-fact.'\" <i>Challenger Caribbean Corp. v. Uni&#243;n General de Trabajadores,</i> 903 F.2d 857, 861 (1st Cir.1990) (quoting <i>In re Hotel Da Vinci,</i> 797 F.2d 33, 34 (1st Cir.1986)). Put differently, \"disregard implies that the arbitrators appreciated the existence of a governing legal rule but wilfully decided not to apply it. As arbitrators need not explain their award, and did not do so here, it is no wonder that appellant is hard pressed to satisfy the exacting criteria for invocation of the doctrine.\" <i>Advest,</i> 914 F.2d at 10 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This standard has not remotely been satisfied here. PRTC contends that the arbitrators failed to recognize various breaches of cardinal contractual obligations by USPhone that provided a defense to USPhone's claims for breach of contract. Thus, for example, USPhone allegedly violated the contract by failing to comply with applicable FCC requirements. PRTC's argument that the district court failed to review the arbitration award under the \"manifest disregard of the law standard\" is nothing more than a thinly veiled attempt to obtain appellate review of the arbitrators' legal and factual determinations regarding the contract dispute. The district court properly rejected PRTC's claim, finding that \"PRTC's objections to the arbitration are essentially disagreements with the arbitrators' conclusions.\" <i>P.R.

Rubbermaid Inc.,</i> 20 F.3d 15, 24 (1st Cir.1994), provides that \"[i]n the event any party or its lawyer has acted obstinately or frivolously, the court shall, in its judgment, impose on such person the payment of a sum for attorney's fees which the court decides corresponds to such conduct.\" P.R. R. Civ. P. 44.1(d). Puerto Rican law thus provides that an award of fees shall be made for either (1) obstinate conduct or (2) frivolous litigation. There is no basis for USPhone's contention that federal law requires a more liberal standard for the award of attorney's fees in suits seeking to set aside arbitration awards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Rule 44.1(d), \"a finding of obstinacy requires that the court determine a litigant to have been unreasonably adamant or stubbornly litigious, beyond the acceptable demands of the litigation, thereby wasting time and causing the court and the other litigants unnecessary expense and delay.\" <i>De Leon Lopez v. Corporacion Insular de Seguros,</i> 931 F.2d 116, 126 (1st Cir.1991). Factual findings of specific instances of misconduct, taking into account the overall character of the litigation, are required to support a finding of obstinacy mandating the award of attorney fees under Puerto Rican law. <i>See, e.g., Mejias-Quiros v. Maxxam Prop. Corp.,</i> 108 F.3d 425, 429 (1st Cir.1997); <i>Dopp v. Pritzker,</i> 38 F.3d 1239, 1253-54 (1st Cir.1994). \"Examples of obstinate conduct include: denying all liability in answering a complaint, where the defendant later admits liability; raising inapplicable defenses; denying all liability when only the amount of damages sought is contested; and denying a fact, knowing it is true.\" <i>Correa v. Cruisers, a Div. Of KCS Int'l, Inc.,</i> 298 F.3d, 13, 31 (1st Cir.2002) (citation omitted). The district court here made no such explicit factual finding, nor does the record otherwise document specific instances of obstinate conduct. <i>Compare Top Entm't,</i> 351 F.3d at 534.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also did not conclude that the motion to vacate was frivolous, although the court did observe that PRTC's filing of its motion was \"a waste of time and resources of this court.\" Moreover, a finding of frivolity would not be justified in this case.

Section 12 of the FAA provides: \"Notice of a motion to vacate ... an award must be served upon the adverse party or his attorney within three months after the award is filed or delivered.\" 9 U.S.C. &#167; 12 (2000). The FAA requires service on nonresidents \"in like manner as other process of the court\" and refers to Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure. Wright &amp; Miller, 4A Fed. Prac. &amp; Proc. Civ.3d &#167; 1101 (2002). Here, PRTC served its motion to vacate on USPhone and its counsel by mail at least four times prior to the deadline, and was able to effect personal service on USPhone on June 5, 2003, one day after the deadline</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether mail service complied with Rule 4 in these circumstances, for courts have held that a failure to comply with Rule 4 (for example, by serving only the defendant's attorney) may be excused if notice actually is received. <i>Id.</i> USPhone does not deny receipt of actual notice during the three month window, nor allege any significant prejudice.

Other courts have broadly interpreted section 3 &#8212; in combination with the district court's inherent power to manage its own docket &#8212; to authorize the district court to issue a stay of litigation involving non-parties. <i>See, e.g., City of Bismarck v.

The award granted $2.5 million in damages to U.S. Phone Manufacturing Corp. (\"USPhone\") for breach of contract. At issue is whether and how parties can contract for standards of judicial review of arbitration awards other than those set forth in the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\" or \"Act\"). 9 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 10, 11 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hold that the judicial review provisions of the FAA can be displaced only by explicit contractual language evincing the parties' clear intent to subject the arbitration award to a different standard of review. Here, no such clear statement was contained in the contract. Under the proper review standard set forth in the FAA there were no grounds for vacating the award.

USPhone was awarded the bid, jointly with two other companies, on February 10, 1988. On December 2, 1988, PRTC and USPhone executed a requirements contract under which USPhone agreed to supply PRTC's five-year requirements of residential memory telephones, estimated at 25,000 per year (\"the contract\"). The contract was drafted by PRTC.

On September 13, 1993, USPhone commenced arbitration against PRTC, before the American Arbitration Association (\"AAA\"). Three years later, following various procedural skirmishes regarding the choice of a neutral arbitrator, the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico ordered the parties to proceed to arbitration. <i>U.S. Phone Mfg.

First, choice-of-law provisions in arbitration contracts (providing that the contract will be governed by the law of a particular state) have been argued to evidence the parties' desire that arbitration be conducted pursuant to state law. Second, even where federal law governs, where an arbitration agreement adopts a particular arbitration rule that departs from the FAA standard (either a state-law rule or one created for the particular agreement), there is an argument that the agreement should be enforced according to its terms, and that the specific rule chosen by the parties should prevail over the FAA standard. Here, we must first determine whether state or federal law applies to the standard of review issue and then determine if the federal standard of the FAA has been displaced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.

The extremely limited judicial review contemplated by the FAA clearly implicates the federal policy favoring final resolution of disputes by arbitration and, in particular, affects the allocation of powers between the court and the arbitrators. <i>Mastrobuono,</i> 514 U.S. at 59-60, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117907\"><a href=\"/opinion/117907/mastrobuono-v-shearson-lehman-hutton-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This is particularly so when the state law at issue is \"specifically and solely applicable to arbitration agreements.\" <i>PaineWebber Inc. v.

Just as the generic choice-of-law clause in <i>Mastrobuono</i> was insufficient to invoke New York law precluding arbitrators' awards of punitive damages, a \"generic choice-of-law clause, standing alone, is insufficient to support a finding that contracting parties intended to opt out of the FAA's default regime\" for vacatur of arbitral awards. <i>Roadway Package Sys., Inc. v.

These other circuits have held that the mere inclusion of a choice-of-law clause within the arbitration agreement is insufficient to indicate the parties' intent to contract for the application of state law concerning judicial review of awards.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, here the choice-of-law provision in Clause 4 of the contract is insufficient to render applicable Puerto Rican law concerning the scope of judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C.

Specifically, it urges that the language of Clause 4 of the contract is not merely a choice-of-law clause because it provides that \"[t]his Contract shall be governed by and interpreted <i>in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.</i>\" Under Puerto Rican law, if the parties' arbitration agreement specifies that the award should be \"conformable to law\" (\"conforme al derecho\"), then the award will be reviewed for legal error. <i>See, e.g., Uni&#243;n de la Industria Licorera de Ponce v.

PRTC argues that the \"in accordance with the laws\" language demonstrates an intent to subject the arbitrators' award to review for errors of law. USPhone, on the other hand, urges the language here is insufficient under Puerto Rican law to invoke review for legal error, and that the contract itself explicitly provides that the findings of the arbitrator \"shall be final and binding for both parties,\" thus precluding more searching review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not decide whether as a matter of local law this contract would be construed as providing for review of legal error, for we conclude that the FAA creates a presumption that the more limited FAA standard will govern, and the language here, as a matter of federal law, is insufficient to overcome the presumption.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The issue whether the parties by contract can supplant the FAA standard of review has generated substantial litigation.

These courts have held that the Act's ultimate purpose is to enforce the terms of the agreement to arbitrate, and that they are therefore bound by federal law to enforce the arbitration agreements as drafted. <i>See, e.g., Roadway,</i> 257 F.3d at 292. At the same time they have recognized that the federal policy in favor of recognizing broad authority of the arbitrators, even if not sufficient to override the parties' agreement for more searching review, at least requires a presumption that the FAA standard will apply. <i>Id.</i> at 294. Thus, in the few cases where courts have found that the parties contracted for more searching judicial review of arbitral awards, there has been explicit contractual language that specified the precise nature of the intended judicial review. <i>See, e.g., Gateway Techs.,</i> 64 F.3d at 996 (contract language stated that \"[t]he arbitration decision shall be final and binding on both parties, except that <i>errors of law shall be subject to appeal</i>\")(emphasis and modification in original); <i>Harris v.

The contract here, even if sufficient under Puerto Rican law, is far short of the explicit language required by federal law to displace the FAA standard of review, particularly in light of the agreement's language that any disputes \"shall be finally settled\" under the AAA Rules. <i>See Elahi,</i> 87 F.3d at 594.

[;][or][w]here the award is imperfect in matter of form not affecting the merits of the controversy.\" 9 U.S.C. &#167; 11 (2000)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Section 3 of the FAA states:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">If any suit or proceeding be brought in any of the courts of the United States upon any issue referable to arbitration under an agreement in writing for such arbitration, the court in which such suit is pending, upon being satisfied that the issue involved in such suit or proceeding is referable to arbitration under such an agreement, shall on application of one of the parties stay the trial of the action until such arbitration has been had in accordance with the terms of the agreement, providing the applicant for the stay is not in default in proceeding with such arbitration.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">9 U.S.C. &#167; 3 (2000). This provision has been interpreted to require a stay of litigation between the parties to the arbitration agreement when the subject of the litigation is within the scope of the agreement. <i>See e.g., Moses H.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">927</span></a></span>. Section 3 does not directly address the issue of stays of litigation involving non-parties. Other courts have broadly interpreted section 3 &#8212; in combination with the district court's inherent power to manage its own docket &#8212; to authorize the district court to issue a stay of litigation involving non-parties. <i>See, e.g., City of Bismarck v.
