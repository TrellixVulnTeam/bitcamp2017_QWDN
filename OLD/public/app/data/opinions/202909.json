The petitioner, Yaacoub Elias\n\nMelhem, a native and citizen of Lebanon, seeks review of the denial\n\nof   his   application   for   asylum,    withholding   of   removal,   and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).          The Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals (BIA), in its own opinion, affirmed the\n\nImmigration Judge's (IJ) determinations that Melhem's application\n\nfor asylum was time-barred, that his testimony was not credible and\n\nhe had not provided corroborating evidence, and that he had not\n\ncarried his burden of proof with respect to his withholding of\n\nremoval and CAT claims.        Melhem was allowed voluntary departure.\n\nWe deny the petition for review.\n\n                                    I.\n\n            Melhem left Lebanon on July 29, 2000, and lawfully\n\nentered the United States with a Lebanese passport and a non-\n\nimmigrant visitor visa that same day.        He was authorized to remain\n\nin the United States until January 27, 2001, but he did not depart\n\nby that date, rendering his continued presence in the United States\n\nunlawful.    Melhem lived first with his maternal uncle, who is a\n\nnaturalized citizen, and then with his brother, who is lawfully in\n\nthe United States on a student visa.        Melhem testified that he did\n\nnot attend school in the United States and that he did not work in\n\nthe United States until he received his work visa in 2004, after he\n\nhad filed for asylum.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f              On February 4, 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization\n\nService1 (INS) instituted removal proceedings against Melhem.                 In\n\nan appearance before an IJ on June 12, 2003, Melhem conceded the\n\nallegations in the Notice to Appear but sought relief from removal.\n\nOn   August    8,   2003,    Melhem    filed   an   application    for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.\n\n              At a hearing on April 15, 2005, the IJ determined that\n\nMelhem's asylum application was time-barred because he had not\n\nfiled for asylum within one year of his arrival in the United\n\nStates, as required by 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2), and he had not\n\ndemonstrated        either   changed     or    extraordinary      circumstances\n\nwarranting an exception to the one-year rule.            In an oral decision\n\nrendered on May 16, 2005, the IJ also denied Melhem's requests for\n\nwithholding of removal and protection under the CAT, based largely\n\non his finding that Melhem's testimony was not credible.\n\n              In a November 13, 2006 opinion, the BIA affirmed the IJ's\n\ndetermination that Melhem's asylum application was time-barred. It\n\nalso affirmed the IJ's adverse credibility finding, noting specific\n\ninconsistencies and omissions catalogued by the IJ, and agreed that\n\nthe lack of credible testimony meant that Melhem had not met his\n\nburden of proof regarding his eligibility for withholding of\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The functions of the INS were shortly thereafter subsumed by\nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fremoval or for protection under the CAT.                 Melhem timely petitioned\n\nthis court for review.\n\n                                            II.\n\n                 Melhem makes several claims on his petition for review.\n\nFirst, he argues that the IJ erred in his adverse credibility\n\nfinding.         Second, he asserts that his asylum request should have\n\nbeen granted.             Third, he argues that the IJ wrongly denied him\n\nwithholding of removal and protection under the CAT.                       The BIA\n\nrejected each of these claims, and so do we.\n\n                 As   a   preliminary   matter,     we   lack   jurisdiction    over\n\nMelhem's asylum application because the IJ found his application to\n\nbe time-barred and the BIA affirmed that determination.                    8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1158(a)(3); see also Sharari v. Gonzales, 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).           Melhem's attempt to cloak his factual disagreement\n\nwith       the    BIA     in   the   garb   of    due    process   to   avoid   this\n\njurisdictional bar is unavailing.2                See Pan v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d\n\n80, 84 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n\n\n       2\n       Melhem also argues that the IJ's refusal to allow Melhem to\namend his application to state that he was a member of the Lebanese\nForces denied him a full and fair trial and demonstrated that the\nIJ had prejudged his claim.      This argument is without merit.\nMelhem had been asked several times under oath whether his\napplication was complete and true. He claimed that his lawyer had\nfilled out his application and that his English was not good enough\nto catch the mistake, yet he slipped into English several times\nduring the hearing. Melhem's assertion that the IJ's refusal went\nbeyond \"expressions of impatience, dissatisfaction, annoyance, [or]\neven anger\" is not borne out by the record.       Liteky v. United\nStates, 510 U.S. 540, 555-56 (1994).\n\n                                            -4-\n\f              We do have jurisdiction to review the BIA's denial of\n\nrelief under the CAT and withholding of removal.                    We review the\n\nBIA's decision under the deferential substantial evidence standard.\n\nJean v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 87, 90 (1st Cir. 2006);                          Long v.\n\nGonzales, 422 F.3d 37, 40 (1st Cir. 2005).               That is, we accept the\n\nBIA's   decision     \"unless       any    reasonable    adjudicator        would   be\n\ncompelled to conclude to the contrary.\"               8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B);\n\nsee also Long, 422 F.3d at 40.\n\n              We   agree    with    the    BIA   that    the   IJ's   credibility\n\ndetermination is sufficiently supported by the record.                      The BIA\n\ndescribed     specific     inconsistencies       and    omissions     in    Melhem's\n\naccount on which the IJ relied when finding Melhem's testimony to\n\nbe incredible.      Melhem claimed persecution based on his political\n\nopinion and membership in a specific social group, yet he did not\n\nlist    his    membership     in    the    Lebanese     Forces   in   either       his\n\napplication or his supporting affidavit, even though he later\n\ntestified that he was a member.            On his application, Melhem stated\n\nthat he attended the American University of Technology in Lebanon\n\nfrom March until May 2001, but when questioned about his attendance\n\nduring his hearing, Melhem stated that he was in the United States\n\nduring that time.        Other notable inconsistencies between Melhem's\n\noriginal application and affidavit and his later testimony include\n\nthe presence of Hizbollah and Islamic Jihad at the anti-Syrian\n\ndemonstrations in which Melhem participated in 1999 and 2000 and\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fthe assertion that Syrian agents were looking for him after he fled\n\nLebanon.     Melhem's         attempts         to    explain    away    these   and    other\n\ninconsistencies are unavailing.\n\n            To    qualify      for    withholding         of    removal,      Melhem     must\n\nestablish    that       his   \"life       or    freedom    would       be   threatened     in\n\n[Lebanon] on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in\n\na   particular     social     group,       or       political    opinion.\"         8   C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.16(b); see also Awad v. Gonzales, 463 F.3d 73, 76 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).      If   he     cannot    demonstrate          that     he   has    suffered     past\n\npersecution, he must establish that it is \"more likely than not\"\n\nthat he will suffer future persecution should he return to Lebanon.\n\n8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2); see also Awad, 463 F.3d at 76.\n\n            Because the IJ can disregard or discount evidence he\n\nfinds incredible, \"an adverse credibility determination can prove\n\nfatal to a claim for . . . withholding of removal\" if the applicant\n\ncannot   meet     his    burden      of    proof      without     relying     on   his   own\n\ntestimony.       Pan, 489 F.3d at 86.                Such is the case here.            Melhem\n\nprovided very little additional evidence to support his account of\n\npast persecution.         Given Melhem's close contact with his family,\n\nand given the presence of his mother and brother in New England at\n\nthe time of his hearing, his failure to offer corroboration is\n\n\n\n\n                                               -6-\n\fnotable.3    See Chahid Hayek v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 501, 508-09 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n            Melhem also failed to provide sufficient evidence that\n\nhis fear of future persecution is well-founded.                   It is not clear\n\nwhy Syrian agents would still be looking for him based on his\n\nparticipation      in    two   student    demonstrations        and    two   day-long\n\ndetentions       that    occurred     over     seven    years    ago.        Cf.   id.\n\n(discounting applicant's fear of future persecution because she\n\nlast participated in a Lebanese Forces activity more than eleven\n\nyears previously).        Further, general reports that some members of\n\na certain group are persecuted in a country do not establish that\n\nit is more likely than not that the applicant himself will suffer\n\npersecution upon his return.             Awad, 463 F.3d at 77.          The BIA did\n\nnot err in upholding the IJ's conclusion that Melhem did not carry\n\nhis burden of proof for his withholding of removal claim.\n\n            To    qualify      for   relief     under   the     CAT,    Melhem     must\n\nestablish that it is \"more likely than not that he . . . would be\n\ntortured if removed to [Lebanon].\"               8 C.F.R. § 208.16(c)(2); see\n\nalso Awad, 463 F.3d at 77.           Evidence of past torture inflicted upon\n\nthe applicant can help meet this burden of proof.                            8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 208.16(c)(3).         Torture means \"severe pain or suffering, whether\n\nphysical or mental,\" that is \"inflicted by or at the instigation of\n\n\n\n     3\n        The   IJ  had   specifically   requested                   such      familial\ncorroboration at a preliminary hearing.\n\n                                         -7-\n\for with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other\n\nperson acting in an official capacity.\"          Id. § 208.18(a)(1); see\n\nalso Awad, 463 F.3d at 77.\n\n             Melhem presented no credible evidence to support his CAT\n\nclaim.   He claimed he had been tortured when he was twice detained\n\nby Syrian agents, but the IJ found this testimony to be not\n\ncredible.4     The IJ also determined that it was not \"more likely\n\nthan not\" that Melhem would be tortured on his return to Lebanon.\n\nIn affirming this conclusion, the BIA pointed out that Melhem's\n\nfather and the rest of his family have lived safely in Lebanon\n\nsince Melhem's departure, even though his father was allegedly\n\ndetained and physically abused for five days by Syrian forces in\n\n1986, and his parents have traveled safely to and from the United\n\nStates several times in recent years.          Melhem attempts to explain\n\nhis father's safety by arguing that the Syrian forces in Lebanon\n\nare only interested in young dissidents.         Yet his brothers -- whom\n\nhe listed as members of the Lebanese Forces in his application and\n\naffidavit -- have also remained safely in Lebanon.             See Ouk v.\n\nGonzales,     464   F.3d   108,   111   (1st   Cir.   2006)   (discounting\n\napplicant's fear of persecution where her family remained safely in\n\n\n\n     4\n       Among other inconsistencies, Melhem testified that after he\nwas detained and tortured in January 2000, he did not leave his\nparents' house again until July 2000, when he left for the United\nStates. Yet on his application he had listed his school attendance\nas stretching from 1996 into 2001, a discrepancy noted by both the\nIJ and the BIA.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fCambodia and traveled to and from the United States); Chahid Hayek,\n\n445 F.3d at 508-09 (sustaining finding of no likelihood of future\n\npersecution   where   applicant's    parents   and   siblings   had   lived\n\nunharmed in Lebanon since her departure).        We agree with the BIA\n\nthat the IJ reasonably concluded that Melhem failed to meet his\n\nburden of proof on his CAT claim.\n\n          We deny the petition for review.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f",

The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), in its own opinion, affirmed the Immigration Judge's (IJ) determinations that Melhem's application for asylum was time-barred, that his testimony was not credible and he had not provided corroborating evidence, and that he had not carried his burden of proof with respect to his withholding of removal and CAT claims. Melhem was allowed voluntary departure. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Melhem left Lebanon on July 29, 2000, and lawfully entered the United States with a Lebanese passport and a non-immigrant visitor visa that same day. He was authorized to remain in the United States until January 27, 2001, but he did not depart by that date, rendering his continued presence in the United States unlawful. Melhem lived first with his maternal uncle, who is a naturalized citizen, and then with his brother, who is lawfully in the United States on a student visa. Melhem testified that he did not attend school in the United States and that he did not work in the United States until he received his work visa in 2004, after he had filed for asylum.</p>\n<p>On February 4, 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service<sup>[1]</sup> (INS) instituted removal proceedings against Melhem. In an appearance before an IJ on June 12, 2003, Melhem conceded the allegations in the Notice to Appear but sought relief from removal. On August 8, 2003, Melhem filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>At a hearing on April 15, 2005, the IJ determined that Melhem's asylum application was time-barred because he had not filed for asylum within one year of his arrival in the United States, as required by 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2), and he had not demonstrated either changed or extraordinary circumstances warranting an exception to the one-year rule. In an oral decision rendered on May 16, 2005, the IJ also denied Melhem's requests for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT, based largely on his finding that Melhem's testimony was not credible.</p>\n<p>In a November 13, 2006 opinion, the BIA affirmed the IJ's determination that Melhem's asylum application was time-barred. It also affirmed the IJ's adverse credibility finding, noting specific inconsistencies and omissions catalogued by the IJ, and agreed that the lack of credible testimony meant that Melhem had not met his burden of proof regarding his eligibility for withholding of removal or for protection under the CAT. Melhem timely petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Melhem makes several claims on his petition for review. First, he argues that the IJ erred in his adverse credibility finding. Second, he asserts that his asylum request should have been granted. Third, he argues that the IJ wrongly denied him withholding of removal and protection under the CAT. The BIA rejected each of these claims, and so do we.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> As a preliminary matter, we lack jurisdiction over Melhem's asylum application because the IJ found his application to be time-barred and the BIA affirmed that determination. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3); <i>see also </i><i>Sharari v. Gonzales,</i> 407 F.3d 467, 473 (1st Cir.2005). Melhem's attempt to cloak his factual disagreement with the BIA in the garb of due process to avoid this jurisdictional bar is unavailing.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> 489 F.3d 80, 84 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>We do have jurisdiction to review the BIA's denial of relief under the CAT and withholding of removal. We review the BIA's decision under the deferential substantial evidence standard. <i>Jean v. Gonzales,</i> 461 F.3d 87, 90 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Long v. Gonzales,</i> 422 F.3d 37, 40 (1st Cir.2005). That is, we accept the BIA's decision \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); <i>see also </i><i>Long,</i> 422 F.3d at 40.</p>\n<p>We agree with the BIA that the IJ's credibility determination is sufficiently supported by the record. The BIA described specific inconsistencies and omissions in Melhem's account on which the IJ relied when finding Melhem's testimony to be incredible. Melhem claimed persecution based on his political opinion and membership in a specific social group, yet he did not list his membership in the Lebanese Forces in either his application or his supporting affidavit, even though he later testified that he was a member. On his application, Melhem stated that he attended the American University of Technology in Lebanon from March until May 2001, but when questioned about his attendance during his hearing, Melhem stated that he was in the United States during that time. Other notable inconsistencies between Melhem's original application and affidavit and his later testimony include the presence of Hizbollah and Islamic Jihad at the anti-Syrian demonstrations in which Melhem participated in 1999 and 2000 and the assertion that Syrian agents were looking for him after he fled Lebanon. Melhem's attempts to explain away these and other inconsistencies are unavailing.</p>\n<p>To qualify for withholding of removal, Melhem must establish that his \"life or freedom would be threatened in [Lebanon] on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b); <i>see also </i><i>Awad v. Gonzales,</i> 463 F.3d 73, 76 (1st Cir.2006). If he cannot demonstrate that he has suffered past persecution, he must establish that it is \"more likely than not\" that he will suffer future persecution should he return to Lebanon. 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2); <i>see also </i><i>Awad,</i> 463 F.3d at 76.</p>\n<p>Because the IJ can disregard or discount evidence he finds incredible, \"an adverse credibility determination can prove fatal to a claim for . . . withholding of removal\" if the applicant cannot meet his burden of proof without relying on his own testimony. <i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 86. Such is the case here. Melhem provided very little additional evidence to support his account of past persecution. Given Melhem's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> close contact with his family, and given the presence of his mother and brother in New England at the time of his hearing, his failure to offer corroboration is notable.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>Chahid Hayek v.

In affirming this conclusion, the BIA pointed out that Melhem's father and the rest of his family have lived safely in Lebanon since Melhem's departure, even though his father was allegedly detained and physically abused for five days by Syrian forces in 1986, and his parents have traveled safely to and from the United States several times in recent years.

Joyce on brief for petitioner.</p>\n<p>Benjamin J. Zeitlin, Office of Immigration Litigation, United States Department of Justice, Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, and Terri J. Scadron, Assistant Director, on brief for respondent.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Circuit Judge, SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge, and LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> LYNCH, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>The petitioner, Yaacoub Elias Melhem, a native and citizen of Lebanon, seeks review of the denial of his application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT). The Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), in its own opinion, affirmed the Immigration Judge's (IJ) determinations that Melhem's application for asylum was time-barred, that his testimony was not credible and he had not provided corroborating evidence, and that he had not carried his burden of proof with respect to his withholding of removal and CAT claims. Melhem was allowed voluntary departure. We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Melhem left Lebanon on July 29, 2000, and lawfully entered the United States with a Lebanese passport and a non-immigrant visitor visa that same day. He was authorized to remain in the United States until January 27, 2001, but he did not depart by that date, rendering his continued presence in the United States unlawful. Melhem lived first with his maternal uncle, who is a naturalized citizen, and then with his brother, who is lawfully in the United States on a student visa. Melhem testified that he did not attend school in the United States and that he did not work in the United States until he received his work visa in 2004, after he had filed for asylum.</p>\n<p>On February 4, 2003, the Immigration and Naturalization Service<sup>[1]</sup> (INS) instituted removal proceedings against Melhem. In an appearance before an IJ on June 12, 2003, Melhem conceded the allegations in the Notice to Appear but sought relief from removal. On August 8, 2003, Melhem filed an application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT.</p>\n<p>At a hearing on April 15, 2005, the IJ determined that Melhem's asylum application was time-barred because he had not filed for asylum within one year of his arrival in the United States, as required by 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2), and he had not demonstrated either changed or extraordinary circumstances warranting an exception to the one-year rule. In an oral decision rendered on May 16, 2005, the IJ also denied Melhem's requests for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT, based largely on his finding that Melhem's testimony was not credible.</p>\n<p>In a November 13, 2006 opinion, the BIA affirmed the IJ's determination that Melhem's asylum application was time-barred. It also affirmed the IJ's adverse credibility finding, noting specific inconsistencies and omissions catalogued by the IJ, and agreed that the lack of credible testimony meant that Melhem had not met his burden of proof regarding his eligibility for withholding of removal or for protection under the CAT. Melhem timely petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Melhem makes several claims on his petition for review. First, he argues that the IJ erred in his adverse credibility finding. Second, he asserts that his asylum request should have been granted. Third, he argues that the IJ wrongly denied him withholding of removal and protection under the CAT. The BIA rejected each of these claims, and so do we.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> As a preliminary matter, we lack jurisdiction over Melhem's asylum application because the IJ found his application to be time-barred and the BIA affirmed that determination. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(3); <i>see also </i><i>Sharari v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201584\"><a href=\"/opinion/201584/sharari-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">467</span></a></span>, 473 (1st Cir.2005). Melhem's attempt to cloak his factual disagreement with the BIA in the garb of due process to avoid this jurisdictional bar is unavailing.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202784\"><a href=\"/opinion/202784/pan-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">80</span></a></span>, 84 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>We do have jurisdiction to review the BIA's denial of relief under the CAT and withholding of removal. We review the BIA's decision under the deferential substantial evidence standard. <i>Jean v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202385\"><a href=\"/opinion/202385/jean-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">461</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">87</span></a></span>, 90 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Long v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201801\"><a href=\"/opinion/201801/long-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 40 (1st Cir.2005). That is, we accept the BIA's decision \"unless any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); <i>see also </i><i>Long,</i> 422 F.3d at 40.</p>\n<p>We agree with the BIA that the IJ's credibility determination is sufficiently supported by the record. The BIA described specific inconsistencies and omissions in Melhem's account on which the IJ relied when finding Melhem's testimony to be incredible. Melhem claimed persecution based on his political opinion and membership in a specific social group, yet he did not list his membership in the Lebanese Forces in either his application or his supporting affidavit, even though he later testified that he was a member. On his application, Melhem stated that he attended the American University of Technology in Lebanon from March until May 2001, but when questioned about his attendance during his hearing, Melhem stated that he was in the United States during that time. Other notable inconsistencies between Melhem's original application and affidavit and his later testimony include the presence of Hizbollah and Islamic Jihad at the anti-Syrian demonstrations in which Melhem participated in 1999 and 2000 and the assertion that Syrian agents were looking for him after he fled Lebanon. Melhem's attempts to explain away these and other inconsistencies are unavailing.</p>\n<p>To qualify for withholding of removal, Melhem must establish that his \"life or freedom would be threatened in [Lebanon] on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b); <i>see also </i><i>Awad v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202416\"><a href=\"/opinion/202416/awad-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">463</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir.2006). If he cannot demonstrate that he has suffered past persecution, he must establish that it is \"more likely than not\" that he will suffer future persecution should he return to Lebanon. 8 C.F.R. § 208.16(b)(2); <i>see also </i><i>Awad,</i> 463 F.3d at 76.</p>\n<p>Because the IJ can disregard or discount evidence he finds incredible, \"an adverse credibility determination can prove fatal to a claim for . . . withholding of removal\" if the applicant cannot meet his burden of proof without relying on his own testimony. <i>Pan,</i> 489 F.3d at 86. Such is the case here. Melhem provided very little additional evidence to support his account of past persecution. Given Melhem's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> close contact with his family, and given the presence of his mother and brother in New England at the time of his hearing, his failure to offer corroboration is notable.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>Chahid Hayek v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202159\"><a href=\"/opinion/202159/hayek-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">445</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span>, 508-09 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>Melhem also failed to provide sufficient evidence that his fear of future persecution is well-founded. It is not clear why Syrian agents would still be looking for him based on his participation in two student demonstrations and two day-long detentions that occurred over seven years ago. <i>Cf. id.</i> (discounting applicant's fear of future persecution because she last participated in a Lebanese Forces activity more than eleven years previously).
