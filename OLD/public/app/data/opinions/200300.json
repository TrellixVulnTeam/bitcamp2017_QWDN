Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Ruth A. Hall with whom Union Law Offices, LLC, was on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Steven M. Gordon with whom Arpiar G. Saunders, Jr., Shaheen &\nGordon, Elaine Michaud, and Devine, Millimet & Branch, PA, were on\nbrief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                            January 24, 2003\n\f     Per Curiam.       Appellant Lorraine Hazard-Chaney, a medical\n\ndoctor, claims that, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights\n\nAct of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e to e-17, she was set up to fail by\n\nher employers and ultimately offered only a probationary renewal of\n\nher contract    because she is African-American.1           The district court\n\ngranted   summary     judgment     to   her   employers,2     concluding   that\n\nappellant    failed    to   adduce      sufficient     evidence    to   counter\n\nappellees'     non-discriminatory        explanation    for   their     actions.\n\nHazard-Chaney v. Optima Healthcare, No. Civ. 00-355-B, 2001 WL\n\n1636433 (Dec. 18, 2001).      We affirm, adding only a few thoughts to\n\nthe district court's thorough opinion.\n\n     (1) Appellant maintains that the district court erred in\n\nconsidering unauthenticated documents submitted by appellees.               Two\n\nproperly considered documents, however, suffice to support the\n\ncourt's determination that appellees set forth legitimate, non-\n\ndiscriminatory    reasons    for     offering   appellant      a   probationary\n\ncontract instead of renewing her original agreement. The March 10,\n\n\n     1\n        Appellant also filed state law claims of wrongful\ntermination, defamation and intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress, some of which were dismissed in an order that has not\nbeen appealed. In its summary judgment ruling, the district court\ndeclined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the residual\nstate law claims.\n     2\n       The defendants-appellees are Optima Healthcare, Optima\nHealth, Inc., Catholic Medical Center Physician Practice Associates\n(\"CMC PPA\") and Dr. Keith A. Lammers, vice president and medical\ndirector of CMC PPA.      In its earlier, unappealed order, the\ndistrict court dismissed the Title VII claim against Dr. Lammers,\nleaving only state law claims pending against him.\n\n                                        -2-\n\f1999 letter to appellant from Dr. Keith Lammers, appellant's\n\nsupervisor, which was submitted to the court by both parties,\n\nidentifies the performance issues cited by appellees as the reason\n\nfor their actions.        In addition, Dr. Lammers stated in a properly\n\nsubmitted affidavit that appellant had finished last out of thirty-\n\ntwo physicians in nine of ten categories in a patient satisfaction\n\nsurvey.    He further reported that he used these results in his\n\nreview of appellant, as he did with all physicians he supervised,\n\nand in developing the conditions of the probationary contract he\n\noffered to her.      We note, moreover, that the district court did not\n\nconsider      the   two   documents   to    which   appellant   specifically\n\nobjected, and her objections to other materials are deemed waived\n\nbecause they were not raised below.            See Utica Mut. Ins. Co. v.\n\nWeathermark Invs., Inc., 292 F.3d 77, 81 (lst Cir. 2002); Perez v.\n\nVolvo Car Corp., 247 F.3d 303, 314-15 (lst Cir. 2001).             Although\n\nappellant quibbles with the statistical validity of the patient\n\nsurvey, it is pure speculation to suggest that any imperfections\n\nnegate the overall message of its results – that appellant fared\n\npoorly compared with her colleagues.\n\n     (2) We acknowledge that the record – including letters of\n\nsupport from patients and an office staff member, as well as\n\nappellant's explanations for some of the circumstances cited by\n\nappellees as examples of poor performance – reflects a dispute\n\nabout   the    quality    of   appellant's    work.     Indeed,   appellant\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fpersuasively argues that some of her difficulties were directly\n\ntraceable to inadequate support from management.        Nonetheless, the\n\nrelevant question is not whether the employers' concerns about\n\nappellant's performance were warranted, but whether they were\n\ngenuine and thus not a pretext for unlawful discrimination. As the\n\ndistrict court recounted, the evidence of record is inadequate to\n\npermit a factfinder to conclude that racial discrimination, rather\n\nthan quality concerns, was the true basis for the employer's\n\ndecision.\n\n      The only evidence with racial content was a statement reported\n\nby appellant from an Optima recruiter who was about to leave the\n\ncompany; the district court viewed the comment as inadmissible\n\nhearsay and declined to consider it.          Appellant testified in her\n\ndeposition as follows regarding the statement:\n\n      He came to tell me that he was leaving and that I should\n      watch my back; that Dr. Lammers always referred to me as\n      Afro – \"African-American\" or \"black,\" in any of the\n      management meetings, reminding people; the implication\n      being that there was some sort of a – I don't know how\n      you would refer to it, maybe low expectation as to\n      productivity.\n\nAppellant points to several other incidents that she views as\n\nracially motivated, including Dr. Lammers' avoiding her and her\n\nchildren at a reception welcoming new physicians, but nothing in\n\nthe   circumstances   of   those   episodes    points   to   race   as   the\n\nunderlying motivation. Although appellant's practice may have been\n\nneglected in certain respects by Optima, the record does not permit\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fan inference that this treatment occurred because she was African-\n\nAmerican rather than – as the company asserted – because she was a\n\nsolo practitioner with comparatively low patient numbers.      In the\n\nface of a downward progression in patient satisfaction with her\n\ncare, including in performance areas unrelated to the management\n\nissues, the recruiter's isolated, unsubstantiated remark – were it\n\nto be considered as non-hearsay, and even when combined with the\n\nseveral racially neutral incidents she cites – is insufficient to\n\ninvigorate her claim of pretext.\n\n      (3) In an effort to cloak facially race-neutral actions with\n\ndiscriminatory significance, appellant relies heavily on a case not\n\ncited to the district court, Thomas v. Eastman Kodak Co., 183 F.3d\n\n38 (lst Cir. 1999).     Thomas recognized that there are contexts in\n\nwhich evidence sufficient to defeat summary judgment can include\n\nactions indicative of discrimination that stem from \"unthinking\n\nstereotypes or bias.\"    Id. at 58.   Appellant would have us consider\n\ndefendants' catalogue of complaints and neglect of her practice as\n\nexamples.\n\n      But this case differs in significant respects from Thomas,\n\nwhere the plaintiff alleged that she was terminated as a result of\n\n\"an evaluation procedure that was tainted by racial bias.\" Id. at\n\n65.   There, the plaintiff asserted bias in subjective performance\n\nreviews by her superior, and she further presented \"'evidence from\n\nwhich the trier of fact reasonably could conclude that [her]\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fabilities and qualifications were equal or superior to employees\n\nwho were retained.'\" Id. (citation omitted).            That is not the case\n\nhere, where appellees rely on evaluations conducted by third\n\nparties in which appellant was ranked virtually at the bottom of\n\nher colleagues as well as complaints about her performance lodged\n\nby patients and co-workers.       Moreover, appellant has not presented\n\nevidence that would permit the conclusion that similarly situated\n\nnon-minority employees were evaluated less harshly.                    Finally,\n\nappellant's status as a contract employee whose first term was\n\nexpiring further distinguishes her situation from that of the\n\nplaintiff in Thomas, who was a long-time employee laid off as a\n\nresult of poor ratings by a new supervisor after many years of\n\nhighly rated service.         On the record before us, attributing the\n\noffer of a probationary contract to racial discrimination would be\n\n\"'unsupported speculation.'\"        Id. (citation omitted).\n\n     (4)    Dr.    Lammers'    overnight    change     in   approach     from    a\n\ntermination, through non-renewal of appellant's contract, to an\n\noffer of    a     probationary   contract   is   not   probative    of    racial\n\nmotivation.3      His original statement that he was unable to continue\n\nher employment \"[w]ith the current undefined future of CMC PPA\" is\n\nnot inconsistent with concerns about her performance, though the\n\nstatement    was     obviously   untrue.      Even     if   Dr.   Lammers       was\n\n\n     3\n       Like the district court, we assume for purposes of our\ndiscussion that the offer of a probationary contract renewal was an\nadverse employment action within the meaning of Title VII.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fdeliberately evasive in the first letter, however, that particular\n\nuntruth,   in   the    context   of   this   record,   would   not   allow   a\n\nfactfinder to conclude that there was racial animus.\n\n     In sum, appellant failed to proffer evidence that would permit\n\na jury to conclude that her employers' asserted justification for\n\noffering only a probationary contract was a pretext for race\n\ndiscrimination.       Consequently, the district court properly entered\n\nsummary judgment for defendants.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f",
