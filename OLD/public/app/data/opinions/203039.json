Winston, Office of Immigration Litigation, Civil\nDivision, Department of Justice, Peter D. Keisler, Assistant\nAttorney General, Civil Division, and David V. Bernal, Assistant\nDirector, Office of Immigration Litigation, on brief for\nrespondent.\n\n\n                           November 30, 2007\n\f            Per Curiam.       Alexander Gosal, a national of Indonesia,\n\nentered the United States in March 1997; he was authorized to\n\nremain in the country as a visitor for six months.                Gosal neither\n\nleft the country as required nor obtained permission to stay\n\nlonger, and on April 24, 2003, the Department of Homeland Security\n\ninstituted    removal      proceedings   against   him.     See    8   U.S.C.   §\n\n1227(a)(1)(B) (2000).\n\n            Gosal conceded the factual allegations but sought asylum\n\nor withholding of removal.         As a practicing Christian, he argued\n\nthat   he   would   face    persecution    from    the   Muslim    majority     in\n\nIndonesia.    He cited one personal incident during which, upon his\n\nreturn from church, a group of men asked him for money; tried to\n\ntake his bible; and hit him in the face.             He also testified that\n\nhis siblings who remained in Indonesia were constantly fearful\n\nabout openly practicing Christianity due to bomb threats against\n\nchurches.\n\n            On October 26, 2005, Gosal presented evidence before an\n\nimmigration judge, who denied relief: Gosal's asylum application\n\nwas untimely, 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B), and the delay was not\n\nexcusable, id. § 1158(a)(2)(C); his withholding of removal claim\n\nwas rejected because he had not established that persecution was\n\nlikely were he removed to Indonesia, id. § 1231(b)(3).                        The\n\nimmigration judge found that the danger did not rise to the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\frequisite   level,   and   that   the    thugs    who    had    assaulted      Gosal\n\n\"principally wanted money.\"\n\n            On appeal, the Board of Immigration Appeals agreed with\n\nthe immigration judge on all counts.           Gosal did not seek review of\n\nthat   order,   instead    filing       with   the      Board    a    motion     for\n\nreconsideration, asserting that the testimony about his siblings'\n\nanxiety had not been considered.          The Board denied the motion on\n\nFebruary 28, 2007. Fears aside, the siblings remained in Indonesia\n\nand practiced their religion unharmed--and, according to the Board,\n\nthat fact outweighed any testimony not cited in its original order.\n\n            Gosal timely petitioned for review of the Board's denial\n\nof his reconsideration motion but of nothing else.                   Therefore, we\n\nreview only that decision, not the initial denial of the relief he\n\nsought; the two orders are independent and we have jurisdiction\n\nonly over those that are appealed.         Ven v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 357,\n\n359 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n            A motion for reconsideration must identify \"the errors of\n\nfact or law in the prior Board decision.\"            8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(b)(1).\n\nGosal did not specify any such errors.           He did claim that a portion\n\nof his testimony had been ignored, but as the Board subsequently\n\nmade clear, the testimony had not been overlooked--it simply had\n\nnot affected the result.\n\n            That explanation--and the denial that it supported--were\n\nnot irrational and did not rest on forbidden grounds; the Board did\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fnot abuse its discretion.   Ven, 386 F.3d at 360.   On the contrary,\n\nthe denial was entirely reasonable and well explained.\n\n          Gosal objects that the Board, in considering his motion,\n\nrequired that he rebut its original decision.       But his argument\n\nrests on a misunderstanding of the Board's decision in Matter of\n\nCerna, 20 I. & N. Dec. 399 (BIA 1991).   What the Board meant in the\n\npassage Gosal cites, id. at 402, is that it will revisit its\n\ndecision afresh, on the original record, if an error is shown to\n\nflaw its initial order.   But to obtain reconsideration, the movant\n\nmust still demonstrate that the original decision \"was defective in\n\nsome regard.\"   Id.   Here, Gosal did not do so.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f",
