Keisler, Assistant Attorney General, M. Jocelyn Lopez\nWright, Assistant Director, Eric W. Marsteller, U.S. Department of\nJustice, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n                              June 15, 2005\n\f             Per Curiam.     Lahesne Belhouchet, a citizen of Algeria,\n\nappeals from a decision of the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)\n\nfinding him ineligible for asylum.            For the following reasons, we\n\nvacate the BIA's decision and remand this case to the BIA for\n\nfurther proceedings.\n\n             Belhouchet applied for asylum on two grounds: (1) that,\n\nin the past, he was persecuted on account of his political opinion\n\nand membership in a particular social group, and (2) that, if\n\nforced to return to Algeria, he feared future persecution on those\n\naccounts.     See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(42), 1158(b)(1); see also 8\n\nC.F.R. § 1208.13(a); Ravindran v. INS, 976 F.2d 754, 758 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).      The Immigration Judge found Belhouchet not credible on\n\neither point and so denied him asylum, including as a discretionary\n\nmatter.      On Belhouchet's appeal from the Immigration Judge's\n\ndecision, the BIA apparently assumed that Belhouchet was credible\n\nbut nevertheless concluded that he had failed to meet his burden of\n\nproving that his past persecution was on account of a protected\n\nground.      However, the BIA failed to address Belhouchet's claim\n\nthat   he   has   a    well-founded    fear   of   future   persecution   on    a\n\nprotected ground.\n\n             It is the BIA's decision, the final agency order, that\n\nthis court reviews.       Mukamusoni v. Ashcroft, 390 F.3d 110, 119 (1st\n\nCir.   2004).         Although   the   standard    of   appellate   review     is\n\ndeferential, INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992), we\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fmay \"judge the action of [the BIA] based only on reasoning provided\n\nby the agency,' . . . and 'that basis must be set forth with such\n\nclarity as to be understandable.\"             Mihaylov v. Ashcroft, 379 F.3d\n\n15, 20-21 (1st Cir. 2004) (internal citations omitted).                 Where the\n\nBIA \"fails to state 'with sufficient particularity and clarity the\n\nreasons for denial of asylum' or otherwise to 'offer legally\n\nsufficient reasons for its decision,'\" id. at 23-24 (quoting\n\nGailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 46-47 (1st Cir. 1994)), we think it\n\nbest to vacate and remand the decision to the agency to address\n\nBelhouchet's future persecution claim in the first instance. In so\n\ndoing, we intimate no view on the merits of that claim or on\n\nBelhouchet's credibility.1\n\n           In   light    of    that   disposition,       we    need   not   address\n\nBelhouchet's    appeal    from    the     BIA's    denial     of   withholding   of\n\ndeportation or his motion to remand the case to the BIA so that he\n\ncan seek   adjustment     of     status    based    on   his   wife's   immigrant\n\nworker's visa.2\n\n\n     1\n      The recent amendments to the Immigration and Nationality Act,\n8 U.S.C. § 1158(b), enacted by the Real ID Act of 2005, Pub. Law\nNo. 109-13, concerning \"mixed-motive\" cases, corroboration, and\ncredibility determinations, are not applicable since those\nprovisions apply only to applications for asylum and other relief\nfrom removal made on or after May 11, 2005.           Real ID Act,\n§ 101(h)(2).\n     2\n      In the course of briefing his motion to remand, Belhouchet\nargued, for the first time, that the Executive Office of Asylum\nReview lacked jurisdiction over his asylum proceedings because no\ncharging document was served on the immigration judge. Assuming,\nwithout deciding, that this argument was not waived by Belhouchet's\n\n                                        -3-\n\f          The order of the BIA is vacated, and the case is remanded\n\nto the BIA for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nThe motion to remand on different grounds is denied, without\n\nprejudice, as moot.   See Local R. 27(c).\n\n\n\n\nfailure to raise it at the administrative level or in his initial\nappellate brief, the argument is frivolous. The record shows that\nthis matter was referred to the immigration judge by the filing of\nForm I-863, Notice of Referral to Immigration Judge, which confers\njurisdiction on the immigration court.
