David H. Souter, Associate Justice (Ret.) of the\nSupreme Court of the United States, sitting by designation.\n\f             BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.     Before us are cross-appeals in a\n\ndecade-long copyright dispute concerning two sitcoms on Puerto\n\nRican television.       On one side is TMTV, Corp., a successor in\n\ninterest to the first sitcom's production company; on the other,\n\nthe second sitcom's production company, Mass Productions, Inc., and\n\nits    principals--including   the    star       of   both   shows,    Emmanuel\n\n\"Sunshine\" Logroño. The district court granted summary judgment to\n\nTMTV on its claim charging infringement; and a jury granted it\n\nsubstantial damages, which the district court reduced by an amount\n\nrecovered by TMTV in settlement of related litigation.\n\n             A summary of events and prior proceedings will suffice.\n\nIn 1997, Antonio Mojena--an established television producer in\n\nPuerto Rico--approached two veteran entertainers--Sunshine Logroño\n\nand Iris Chacón--about co-hosting a variety show on Puerto Rican\n\ntelevision.     The show would be called De Noche con Iris y Sunshine\n\nand would begin with four two-hour episodes, continuing thereafter\n\nif    it   proved   popular.   Chacón      and    Logroño    both     agreed   to\n\nparticipate.\n\n             During Mojena's initial pitch, he and Logroño discussed\n\nfilling some of the two-hour episodes of De Noche con Iris y\n\nSunshine with comedy segments.        To that end, Logroño arranged a\n\nmeeting in late September or early October 1997 with a team of\n\ncomedians     and   scriptwriters,    including       scriptwriters     Roberto\n\nJiménez and Miguel Morales; Jiménez had worked with Logroño before,\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fwhile Morales had not.   At the meeting Jiménez suggested a sitcom\n\ncentered on a condominium building and its residents.       Logroño\n\napproved of the idea of setting a comedy segment in a condominium\n\nbuilding, and the title 20 Pisos de Historia (\"20 Pisos\") was\n\nchosen.\n\n          The session produced a number of suggestions for dramatis\n\npersonae, many modeled on preexisting characters taken from other\n\nprojects involving the team.    For example, a focus of the sitcom\n\nwas to be a gossipy security guard in the lobby named \"Vázquez,\"\n\nwho was based on a character Logroño played in a comedy segment in\n\na previous television special, Sunshine a la BBQ. \"Soto,\" an older\n\nwoman living alone, was drawn from a character in another prior\n\nLogroño show, La Tripletta.    These and like adaptations were used\n\nwhen the sitcom was aired.\n\n          After this discussion of ideas, Logroño asked Morales to\n\nwrite scripts for two of the first three episodes of 20 Pisos and\n\nJiménez to write the third.     Logroño's recollection was that he\n\nframed the plots of all three, and Morales and Jiménez merely\n\nprepared dialogue to conform to Logroño's storylines. By contrast,\n\nMorales claims that he wrote the two scripts at home, by himself,\n\nbased on the general concepts aired at the meeting; similarly,\n\nJiménez claims to have taken the general ideas from the session and\n\nfixed them in writing for the first time.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f            The writers delivered their scripts to Logroño, who\n\nretyped all three using special screen-writing software.     On the\n\ncover pages, Logroño listed Morales as the author of episodes one\n\nand three and Jiménez as the author of episode two.   Logroño claims\n\nto have made substantial changes in the scripts given to him, but\n\nthe trail of drafts shows only minimal editing.   And while Logroño\n\nappears to have co-written a number of later scripts for 20 Pisos,\n\nthese reflected themes and characters set up in the first three\n\nepisodes.\n\n            The first episode of 20 Pisos aired on the inaugural\n\nbroadcast of the variety show, De Noche con Iris y Sunshine, on\n\nNovember 7, 1997. The show was produced by Creative Relief Corp.--\n\na business wholly owned by Mojena--and broadcast in Puerto Rico by\n\nthe WKAQ television station, an affiliate of the Telemundo network.\n\nThe early episodes were successful and the variety show--and the 20\n\nPisos sitcom within it--became a recurring weekly program for\n\nalmost two years (although renamed after Chacón left).\n\n            In December 1999, Logroño decamped from WKAQ for a rival\n\ntelevision station--WAPA, an affiliate of Televicentro--where he\n\nstarred in a new sitcom produced by Mass Productions (a company\n\ncontrolled by Logroño and his wife), titled El Condominio. The new\n\nshow, which began airing on WAPA in March 2000, featured many of\n\nthe same actors as 20 Pisos.   The show retained the old characters\n\nand the sitcom unfolded in a virtually identical condominium\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fsetting,       although      new   stories    were    developed     and   some   new\n\ncharacters added.\n\n               On March 15, 2000, TMTV brought a copyright infringement\n\naction in federal district court against Logroño, his wife, and\n\ntheir production company, Mass Productions.1                  The suit sought a\n\ndeclaratory         judgment    and    various    other    legal    and   equitable\n\nremedies. Logroño filed an answer and counterclaim, asserting that\n\nhe was the sole owner of the copyright to the outlines, scripts,\n\nand characters used for 20 Pisos and that he was owed royalty\n\npayments for the use of these properties by TMTV.\n\n               In   due     course,   the    district     court    granted    summary\n\njudgment in the plaintiff's favor.                TMTV, Corp. v. Mass Prods.,\n\nInc. (TMTV I), 345 F. Supp. 2d 196 (D.P.R. 2004).                   The court held\n\nthat Morales and Jiménez had authored the first three scripts of 20\n\nPisos       pursuant   to    valid    work-for-hire     agreements     with   TMTV's\n\npredecessor in interest and that all later episodes of 20 Pisos\n\nwere derivative of the first three.                     Id. at 204-08.         As to\n\ninfringement, the district court found 20 Pisos and El Condominio\n\nvirtually identical.           Id. at 213.\n\n               In December 2004, a month or so after this decision,\n\nTelevicentro--the network on which El Condominio was broadcast--\n\n\n\n        1\n      TMTV is wholly owned by Mojena, who formed it from a\npredecessor entity in January 1999. In February 1999, Creative\nRelief--the initial production company for De Noche con Iris y\nSunshine--assigned its putative copyrights to TMTV.\n\n                                            -5-\n\fsought unsuccessfully to intervene and to have the partial summary\n\njudgment set aside. In August 2005, TMTV sought to consolidate its\n\nown suit with two others now pending before another district judge:\n\nan infringement suit by TMTV against Televicentro for broadcasting\n\nEl Condominio and a suit against TMTV by a group of actors claiming\n\ncopyright in the characters they had portrayed in 20 Pisos.     This\n\nmotion too was denied.\n\n          Thereafter, Logroño made his own failed attempt to undo\n\nthe liability ruling against the defendants by claiming that the\n\nscriptwriters' work-for-hire agreements with TMTV were invalid.\n\nTMTV, Corp. v. Mass Prods., Inc. (TMTV II), 453 F. Supp. 2d 378,\n\n382-83 (D.P.R. 2006). He also sought, unsuccessfully, to forestall\n\na trial on damages by arguing that a private intervening settlement\n\nof the suit by TMTV against Televicentro meant that any further\n\naward to TMTV would be an impermissible double recovery.\n\n          Prior to the trial, TMTV elected to claim only its actual\n\ndamages (and not the defendants' profits or statutory damages).\n\nSee 17 U.S.C. § 504 (2006).     TMTV's expert witness, economist\n\nMichael Einhorn, estimated damages as at least $4.9 million, based\n\non licensing fees TMTV allegedly would have earned but for the\n\ninfringement by the defendants; this was measured in part by\n\nlicensing fees actually earned by another comparable sitcom on\n\nPuerto Rican television.   The jury awarded TMTV $772,079.29.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f              Following the verdict, the district court, over TMTV's\n\nobjection, reduced the award by $700,000, representing the amount\n\nthat TMTV had received in settlement from Televicentro.            The court\n\nawarded TMTV prejudgment interest at the local-court rate of 5\n\npercent per annum on the original jury verdict up through the date\n\nof the Televicentro settlement and, from then on, on the much\n\nsmaller balance.       Finally, the court denied TMTV's request for\n\nattorneys' fees as barred by the registration requirement of the\n\nCopyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 412.\n\n              Both parties filed timely appeals, and we begin with\n\nLogroño's challenges to the summary judgment--most importantly, his\n\nattack   on    the   infringement   ruling   against   him   and    his   co-\n\ndefendants.      That ruling in turn required that TMTV show both\n\nownership of a validly copyrighted work and improper copying of the\n\nprotected elements of that work.      Yankee Candle Co. v. Bridgewater\n\nCandle Co., 259 F.3d 25, 33 (1st Cir. 2001).           Our review of the\n\nsummary judgment ruling is de novo.\n\n              Since TMTV's claim to copyright runs through Jiménez and\n\nMorales, the first question is whether they or Logroño should be\n\nviewed as the creator of the original scripts. Jiménez and Morales\n\nsay that once the condominium setting was agreed upon, they wrote\n\nthe initial three scripts, framing the plots and dialogue and\n\ndrawing in part on stock characters used in previous projects in\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fwhich the team had participated. Logroño says that he outlined the\n\nplots and rewrote the scripts.\n\n            Ordinarily, a credibility contest means that the case\n\nmust be tried but, in this instance, Logroño's claim to have\n\nsubstantially rewritten the scripts is refuted by comparing the\n\noriginals   and   the   final   product.    As   for   Logroño's   supposed\n\noutlining of the plots, he has pointed to no writing--neither any\n\nwritten outline by him nor any notes taken by anyone at the\n\noriginal meeting--that reflects anything like an outline of the\n\nscripts.    At best, Logroño's version would mean that he suggested\n\nsome general ideas for plots and possible stock characters for the\n\ninitial scripts.\n\n            One of the axiomatic requirements for copyright is that\n\nthe author's work be \"fixed.\"      17 U.S.C. § 102(a).     Copyright is a\n\nprotection afforded to the definite expression of ideas but not the\n\nideas themselves.       See, e.g., Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v.\n\nReid, 490 U.S. 730, 737 (1989); Erickson v. Trinity Theatre, Inc.,\n\n13 F.3d 1061, 1071 (7th Cir. 1994).        On this record, the district\n\ncourt properly found that there was no case on liability for a\n\njury.    Scott v. Harris, 550 U.S. 372, 380 (2007).2\n\n\n\n     2\n      Nimmer raises the possibility of joint authorship in a case\nwhere one party supplies the plot ideas and another writes them\ndown, 1 M. Nimmer & D. Nimmer, Nimmer on Copyright § 6.07[A][3][a],\nat 6-21 (rev. ed. 2009); but it is not certain that this suggestion\nis consistent with authorities like Reid and anyway Logroño is not\narguing that the parties aimed at joint authorship.\n\n                                    -8-\n\f           Logroño claims to have suggested the security guard and\n\nother characters; but nothing in the record indicates that they had\n\nthe delineation needed to make them subject to copyright.            Stock\n\ncharacters, like stock scènes à faire, are not subject to copyright\n\nprotection.     Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp., 45 F.2d 119, 121\n\n(2d Cir. 1930), cert. denied, 282 U.S. 902 (1931); 1 P. Goldstein,\n\nGoldstein on Copyright § 2.7.2, at 2:91-93 (3d ed. 2005); cf.\n\nCoquico, Inc. v. Rodríguez-Miranda, 562 F.3d 62, 68 (1st Cir.\n\n2009).   So even if Logroño suggested      general plot ideas and stock\n\ncharacters, his claim to authorship of the scripts still fails.\n\n           Positing Jiménez and Morales as the authors, ownership\n\nmust still be traced to TMTV.        Although the copyright ordinarily\n\nvests in the initial author or authors, 17 U.S.C. § 201(a), TMTV\n\nclaims that the three scripts fall within the work \"made for hire\"\n\nrubric, id. § 201(b), meaning that the original production company\n\nwould be considered the author. The district court agreed and, the\n\noriginal production company having assigned its rights to TMTV, the\n\ncourt treated TMTV as the copyright owner.        TMTV II, 453 F. Supp.\n\n2d at 381-82; TMTV I, 345 F. Supp. 2d at 206-07.\n\n           Jiménez and Morales confirmed in depositions that this\n\nwas their own oral understanding with the production company; but\n\nthe   statute   requires   express    agreement   in   a   signed   written\n\ninstrument, see 17 U.S.C. § 101 (definition); and the circuits are\n\ndivided as to whether the language and policy require the writing\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fbefore the creation or at least the completion of the work.3                            But\n\neven assuming that the rights remained with the scriptwriters,\n\nbefore      this       case    began    they     conveyed    (in    writing,    17   U.S.C.\n\n§ 204(a)) whatever rights they had to TMTV.                         We may rely on this\n\nassignment even though the district court did not.                        Torres v. E.I.\n\nDupont de Nemours & Co., 219 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n                 Logroño next argues that he participated heavily in\n\nwriting later scripts and that the district court's conclusion that\n\nthese scripts were derivative works of the first three was cursory\n\nand unsupported.              See TMTV I, 345 F. Supp. 2d at 207-08.             But this\n\nwas not his theory in the district court and so is forfeit,\n\nSantiago-Sepúlveda v. Esso Standard Oil Co. (P.R.), No. 09-2312,\n\n2011 WL 1548933, *3 (1st Cir. Apr. 26, 2011); nor, given the full\n\nscale development of the show in the first three scripts, would\n\nthis new take be persuasive.\n\n                 The     second        element     in   the        liability    claim    is\n\ninfringement, which requires proof that actual copying occurred and\n\nthat       the   copying       was     so   extensive       that    the   two   works   are\n\n\"substantially similar.\"                 Segrets, Inc. v. Gillman Knitwear Co.,\n\n\n\n       3\n      Compare Schiller & Schmidt, Inc. v. Nordisco Corp., 969 F.2d\n410, 413 (7th Cir. 1992) (written work-for-hire agreement must\nprecede creation of work), and Gladwell Gov't Servs., Inc. v. Cnty.\nof Marin, 265 F. App'x 624, 626 (9th Cir. 2007) (same), with\nPlayboy Enters., Inc. v. Dumas, 53 F.3d 549, 559 (2d Cir.) (written\nagreement might postdate creation if \"memorializing\" earlier oral\nagreement), cert. denied, 516 U.S. 1010 (1995). See also 1 Nimmer\n& Nimmer, supra, § 5.03[B][2][b], at 5-56.\n\n                                               -10-\n\f207 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 531 U.S. 827 (2000).\n\nHowever, Logroño obviously had access to the original scripts and\n\nbased El Condominio upon them, bringing with him a number of the\n\nactors.    The   initial        episode    of   El   Condominio      mentioned     the\n\ncharacters'    move    to   a    new    building;     and     the    El    Condominio\n\nadvertising    campaign     invited       viewers    to   reconnect        with   their\n\nfavorite characters at a new location.\n\n           So copying is not in doubt and the issue is substantial\n\nsimilarity, which requires comparing the expressive elements of the\n\ncopyrighted work contributed by the author--the components alone\n\nsubject   to   copyright    protection--with          those    of    the    allegedly\n\ninfringing work.      Yankee Candle, 259 F.3d at 33.                No infringement\n\nclaim lies if the similarity between two works rests necessarily on\n\nnon-copyrightable      aspects     of     the   original--for        example,     \"the\n\nunderlying ideas, or expressions that are not original with the\n\nplaintiff.\" Matthews v. Freedman, 157 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 1998);\n\naccord Johnson v. Gordon, 409 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           Infringement can occur where--without copying a single\n\nline--the later author borrows wholesale the entire backdrop,\n\ncharacters, inter-relationships, genre, and plot design of an\n\nearlier work.4        Imagine, for example, that the first Sherlock\n\n\n     4\n      Such an ensemble may be protected by copyright, when reduced\nto expression in a book or script, even though it may itself\ncontain non-copyrightable elements, such as stock characters\nborrowed from prior works. See, e.g., Barris/Fraser Enters. v.\nGoodson-Todman Enters., Ltd., No. 86 Civ. 5037 (EW), 1988 WL 3013,\n\n                                        -11-\n\fHolmes stories had been penned and copyrighted last year by Sir\n\nArthur Conan Doyle, and Logroño had then written his own sequels\n\ncarrying everything forward into a new plot.    See, e.g., Anderson\n\nv. Stallone, No. 87-0592 WDKGX, 1989 WL 206431, at *8 (C.D. Cal.\n\nApr. 25, 1989).   Here, we agree with the district court that\n\n          the similarities between the two programs are\n          so striking that there is no doubt that \"El\n          Condominio\"   is   .  .   .  an   unauthorized\n          derivative work.     In effect . . . both\n          programs are the same with only a difference\n          in name and transmitted via a different\n          channel. Specifically, the setting, character\n          names,   costumes,   character  interactions,\n          comedy line, mood, [and] camera angles are\n          almost identical in both sitcoms.\n\nTMTV I, 345 F. Supp. 2d at 213.\n\n          Logroño's claimed differences between the two shows are\n\nnot significant. For example, although the action in El Condominio\n\nunfolds largely in a condominium building lobby virtually identical\n\nto the lobby setting in 20 Pisos, the second sitcom also added some\n\nscenes in a laundry room and the handyman's space; so, too, some\n\ncharacters are given more dialogue or minor variations in character\n\ntraits (e.g., a new hearing problem).    Such trivial modifications\n\nare not a defense.   Cf. Coquico, 562 F.3d at 68; Matthews, 157 F.3d\n\nat 28.\n\n\n\nat *5 (S.D.N.Y.

The jury awarded $772,079, but the district judge\n\nreduced this figure by $700,000 for the settlement payment TMTV\n\nreceived from Televicentro. Logroño argues that all of the damages\n\nawarded by the jury should have been erased by the settlement;\n\nTMTV, as cross-appellant, claims that none of the damages awarded\n\nby the jury should have been reduced by the settlement payment.\n\n           The     acts   of   infringement       by   the   defendants   and   by\n\nTelevicentro are not identical but they are entangled: Logroño and\n\nhis   production    company    produced     the    infringing    El   Condominio\n\nprograms and Televicentro broadcast them.                In this case, TMTV's\n\ntheory of damages at trial was that the infringement diverted from\n\nTMTV potential licensing royalties; this was patently a claim for\n\nplaintiff's damages rather than defendants' profits.5\n\n           We start with the defendants' claims.                 The defendants\n\nmake two different arguments for their view that the prior TMTV-\n\nTelevicentro settlement barred any recovery at trial. The first is\n\nthat the settlement constituted a release of claims against any\n\navailable party who could be charged with infringement based on the\n\nsame episode; the second, that the judgment entered upon the\n\n\n      5\n      The Copyright Act of 1976 allows a party who recovers its\nactual damages to recover any profits made by the infringers, at\nleast to the extent that the infringers' profits are not already\n\"taken into account in computing the actual damages.\" 17 U.S.C.\n§ 504(b); see also 4 Nimmer & Nimmer, supra, § 14.01[A], at 14-7.\nTMTV agreed before trial to drop any claim it may have had to\nrecover the defendants' profits.\n\n                                     -13-\n\fsettlement is res judicata, precluding any further claims against\n\nthe defendants.\n\n            Older common law doctrine tended toward the view that a\n\nsettlement with one tortfeasor extinguished claims against other\n\njoint tortfeasors responsible for the same harm--although who was\n\na joint tortfeasor and what constituted the same harm could be\n\nfraught questions; but the modern view is strongly in favor of\n\ntreating a settlement with one joint tortfeasor as releasing the\n\nothers    only   if   the   parties   to     the   settlement   so   intended;\n\notherwise, the settlement becomes an offset against later judgments\n\nif needed to avoid double recovery.6\n\n            The TMTV-Televicentro settlement, as an agreement, is\n\narguably interpreted under Puerto Rico law, Great Clips, Inc. v.\n\nHair Cuttery of Greater Bos., L.L.C., 591 F.3d 32, 35 (1st Cir.\n\n2010), although federal law might be thought to bear on whether a\n\nfederal judgment incorporating a settlement should reduce a later\n\nfederal judgment on a federal claim, Singer v. Olympia Brewing Co.,\n\n878 F.2d 596, 599-600 (2d Cir. 1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1024\n\n(1990).    But the question of which law applies is academic here,\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      See Zenith Radio Corp. v. Hazeltine Research, Inc., 401 U.S.\n321, 343-47 (1971) (release); McDermott, Inc. v. AmClyde, 511 U.S.\n202, 207-11 (1994) (credit for settlement).          See generally\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments § 50 (1982); Restatement (Second)\nof Torts §§ 885-886 (1979); W. Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on\nthe Law of Torts §§ 48-49, at 330-35 (5th ed. 1984).\n\n                                      -14-\n\fbecause both Puerto Rico and federal law follow the modern approach\n\nin looking to the intent of those who made the settlement.7\n\n          The   defendants   claim   that   TMTV's   acceptance   of   the\n\nsettlement payment bespeaks an intent to relinquish claims against\n\nnon-settling tortfeasors, absent an express reservation of rights.\n\nIn some situations, a settlement with a joint tortfeasor might\n\nsuggest such an intent, see Keeton, supra, § 49, at 335--for\n\nexample, a release discharging \"any and all persons\" potentially\n\nliable on the stated claims.         But the opposite is often more\n\nplausible: frequently, the plaintiff gives a break to the first\n\nsettling defendant, puts some money in the bank, and aims for a\n\nhigher judgment against non-settling defendants.         If the release\n\nwere for all, a larger settlement would be demanded.\n\n          Here, the settlement itself was apparently oral and TMTV\n\ndenies any such intent to release others besides Televicentro. The\n\ndefendants--on whom the burden of proof falls to prove release,\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)--point to nothing to suggest that Televicentro\n\nhad such an intent.   Indeed, the defendants do not even suggest a\n\n\n\n\n     7\n      Compare BUC Int'l Corp. v. Int'l Yacht Council Ltd., 517 F.3d\n1271, 1276-79 (11th Cir. 2008), and Screen Gems-Columbia Music,\nInc. v. Metlis & Lebow Corp., 453 F.2d 552, 554 & n.2 (2d Cir.\n1972), with Vernet v. Serrano-Torres, 566 F.3d 254, 260-61 (1st\nCir. 2009) (citing Merle v. West Bend Co., 97 P.R. Dec. 403\n(1969)), Río Mar Assocs., LP v. UHS of P.R., Inc., 522 F.3d 159,\n164-67 (1st Cir. 2008) (citing Szendrey v. Hospicare, 158 P.R. Dec.\n648 (2003)), and Ortiz v. Banco Popular de P.R., 934 F. Supp. 29,\n32 (D.P.R. 1996) (citing Merle, 97 P.R. Dec. 403).\n\n                                 -15-\n\fplausible reason why Televicentro should have wished to pay a\n\nlarger settlement in order to protect the defendants in this case.\n\n           Turning then to the judgment entered pursuant to the\n\nTelevicentro settlement, it says that the $700,000 payment is made\n\n\"in   satisfaction   of   all   causes       of   action   identified   in   the\n\nComplaint [against Televicentro] and its amendments.\"              The claims\n\nin that complaint identified acts by Televicentro, including the\n\nbroadcast of episodes of El Condominio, as alleged violations of\n\nTMTV's copyright based on the original scripts; but the complaint\n\nasserted no claims against the present defendants based on their\n\nproduction of the shows.\n\n           A   judgment   has   the    meaning     (objectively   determined)\n\nintended by the court that framed and entered it, cf. Concilio de\n\nSalud Integral de Loíza, Inc. v. Perez-Perdomo, 625 F.3d 15, 19-20\n\n(1st Cir. 2010); but where the judgment is based on a settlement,\n\ncourts may look to the intent of the settling parties, 18A C.\n\nWright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal Practice and Procedure\n\n§ 4443, at 262 (2d ed. 2002); cf. Hermes Automation Tech., Inc. v.\n\nHyundai Elecs. Indus. Co., 915 F.2d 739, 751 n.10 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nHere, nothing shows that either the judge who entered the prior\n\njudgment or the parties to that case intended to release anyone\n\nelse.\n\n           The result is the same if the settlement aspect is\n\nignored and formal res judicata rules are applied to the judgment.\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fBecause no issues were adjudicated in the settled case, issue\n\npreclusion    is   irrelevant   and    the   concern    is   only   with   claim\n\npreclusion. Classically, claim preclusion applies only where there\n\nis (1) a prior final judgment on the merits (2) on the same or\n\nsufficiently identical claims (3) between the same parties or their\n\nprivies.   Airframe Sys., Inc. v. Raytheon Co., 601 F.3d 9, 14 (1st\n\nCir. 2010).\n\n           Whether or not the defendants are treated as joint\n\ntortfeasors, they were not parties to the settled case and are not\n\nin privity with Televicentro.          See Taylor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S.\n\n880, 894 (2008). Claim preclusion extends beyond parties and their\n\nprivies only in unusual circumstances;8 consider, for example,                a\n\nplaintiff, unsuccessful against an initial defendant, seeking to\n\nlitigate     identical   claims   against      new     but   closely   related\n\ndefendants. Negrón-Fuentes v. UPS Supply Chain Solutions, 532 F.3d\n\n1, 10 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           Eliminating entirely the party or privy condition would\n\nrequire that whenever a plaintiff sued a defendant, the plaintiff\n\nalso sue in the same action all other defendants against whom the\n\nplaintiff might have related claims.           No such compulsory joinder\n\nrequirement appears in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or\n\n\n\n     8\n      See FleetBoston Fin. Corp. v. Alt, 638 F.3d 70, 80-81 (1st\nCir. 2011); Airframe Sys., 601 F.3d at 17-18; In re El San Juan\nHotel Corp., 841 F.2d 6, 10-11 (1st Cir. 1988); see also Gambocz v.\nYelencsics, 468 F.2d 837, 842 (3d Cir. 1972).\n\n                                      -17-\n\felsewhere. Cf. Restatement (Second) of Judgments, supra, § 49. If\n\nsuch a rule were ever adopted--and this itself would be a debatable\n\nchoice--fairness      would       require    advance     warning      to   potential\n\nplaintiffs and probably major qualifications on the requirement\n\nitself.\n\n            As for TMTV's objection to the offset, the modern view,\n\nas already stated, is that an offset is conventional where needed\n\nto prevent recovering twice for the same harm.                    There are other\n\nsolutions apart from a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the judgment\n\nby   the   amount   of    the     settlement,     including      a    more   complex\n\nproportional    regime      that    the     Supreme     Court   has    employed   in\n\nadmiralty cases.      See McDermott, 511 U.S. at 211-17; cf. Río Mar\n\nAssocs., 522 F.3d at 166-67 (Puerto Rico law).                   But neither side\n\nargues here that some other method should be used.\n\n            Rather,      TMTV's    claim    is   that    the    reduction    is   not\n\nwarranted because (it asserts) the settlement was for a different\n\nharm, in that Logroño prepared a derivative work, 17 U.S.C. §\n\n106(2), while Televicentro publicly transmitted it, id. § 106(4).\n\nTrue, some of the infringing acts differed: Logroño acted and wrote\n\nscripts; the television company broadcast the programs.                      But the\n\ndamages were (on TMTV's own theory) the same harm: the lost\n\nroyalties that could have been earned by TMTV for the production\n\nand broadcast of the El Condominio programs if TMTV's right had\n\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fbeen respected instead of infringed. Production and broadcast were\n\ntwo necessary, sequential steps needed to cause the same damage.\n\n          TMTV also says that the Televicentro settlement was for\n\nTelevicentro's profits rather than TMTV's damages. Although damage\n\nliability is joint and several, Screen Gems, 453 F.2d at 554,\n\nliability for profits is several only, MCA, Inc. v. Wilson, 677\n\nF.2d 180, 186 (2d Cir. 1981).9        But nothing supports TMTV's claim\n\nthat the Televicentro settlement was, sub silentio, restitution of\n\nprofits but not compensation of actual damages. Indeed, the damage\n\nexpert in both cases was the same.           In sum, the district court's\n\ntreatment of the settlement was correct.\n\n          The defendants argue lastly that the district court erred\n\nin its award of prejudgment interest (5 percent on the full jury\n\ndamage award up to settlement and thereafter only on the balance).\n\nThe defendants say that the Copyright Act does not authorize the\n\naward of prejudgment interest and that, if the statute does permit\n\nsuch an award, the equities do not favor an award here or at least\n\nthe award should have been made at a lower rate of interest.\n\n          The   Copyright      Act    does     not     expressly     authorize\n\nprejudgment   interest   but   authority     for     such   an   award   can   be\n\ninferred, where appropriate, from congressional purpose and general\n\n\n\n     9\n      While separate profits of two infringers might well be\nrecovered without duplication, a copyright plaintiff may recover\nactual damages and the infringers' profits only to the extent that\nprofits are not subsumed in actual damages. 17 U.S.C. § 504(b).\n\n                                     -19-\n\fprinciples.   Rodgers v. United States, 332 U.S. 371, 373 (1947).\n\nHere, as actual damages were calculated, TMTV was deprived of\n\nroyalties that would have been due had the defendants produced the\n\ninfringing programs under license.        Prejudgment interest dating\n\nfrom the infringements compensated the plaintiff for the time value\n\nof monies it should have had--just as if a contract debt had not\n\nbeen paid on time.\n\n           Conversely, the defendants had the use of additional\n\nfunds--whatever   portion   of   their   assets   corresponded    to   such\n\nroyalties--during the period before the judgment, so an award of\n\nprejudgment interest also avoids unjust enrichment.              Cf. Frank\n\nMusic Corp. v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc., 886 F.2d 1545, 1552 (9th\n\nCir. 1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1017 (1990).            Because the\n\nTelevicentro settlement provided TMTV with most of the deficiency\n\nfrom that time forward, the defendants' interest obligations on the\n\nreduced balance give them a slight windfall--although not at TMTV's\n\nexpense.\n\n           Our own case law treats an award of prejudgment interest\n\nin such cases as a matter for the informed discretion of the\n\ndistrict court.   See John G. Danielson, Inc. v. Winchester-Conant\n\nProps., Inc., 322 F.3d 26, 51 (1st Cir. 2003).10        Given the range\n\n\n     10\n      The case law in other circuits is too various to summarize,\nbut broadly speaking a number of circuits support prejudgment\ninterest awards for copyright infringement; and circuit cases where\nsuch awards have been disallowed do not in general apply a\ncategorical ban. Compare, e.g., McRoberts Software, Inc. v. Media\n\n                                  -20-\n\fof circumstances and the mix of motives for such awards, this\n\nflexibility may make sense.           Certainly on the present facts there\n\nwas no abuse of discretion in making the award or in limiting it in\n\nthe fashion adopted by the district judge.\n\n            For    post-judgment       interest       on    federal      judgments,   a\n\nuniform federal rate applies by statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1961 (2006)\n\n(weekly    average     yield   of    one-year    constant        maturity    treasury\n\nbills),    but    no   default      federal    rate    exists      for    prejudgment\n\ninterest; here, the district judge applied the prevailing rate of\n\n5 percent used in Puerto Rico courts for both pre- and post-\n\njudgment interest.        P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, App. III, R. 44.3\n\n(2000). The federal post-judgment section 1961 interest rate would\n\nhave been approximately 0.5 percent when judgment was entered in\n\nJanuary 2009.\n\n            The defendants claim that it was obligatory or at least\n\nmore equitable to use the lower federal rate even though it is\n\ndesigned    for   post-judgment       interest.            The   considerations   are\n\nsomewhat different where, absent a stay or bond, the successful\n\nplaintiff can effectively require prompt payment, see Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 64(b), and the present federal rate is depressed by current\n\nmonetary policy designed to combat recession.                     The choice of the\n\n\n\n100, Inc., 329 F.3d 557, 572-73 (7th Cir. 2003) (upholding award),\nwith Robert R. Jones Assocs., Inc. v. Nino Homes, 858 F.2d 274,\n277, 282 (6th Cir. 1988) (vacating award). See generally 4 Nimmer\n& Nimmer, supra, § 14.02[C][1], at 14-31 to -34.\n\n                                        -21-\n\flocal rate, like the award itself, was within the sound discretion\n\nof the district judge.   E.g., Colon Velez v. P.R. Marine Mgmt.,\n\nInc., 957 F.2d 933, 941 (1st Cir. 1992).        Five percent is by\n\nhistorical standards hardly exorbitant.\n\n          The last issue is attorneys' fees.       Ordinarily, the\n\nprevailing party in a copyright case can be awarded fees \"[e]xcept\n\nas otherwise provided by\" the statute.    17 U.S.C. § 505.   Here,\n\nsuch an award was barred by statute because the copyright for the\n\nscripts was not registered in a timely fashion.    Id. § 412; see,\n\ne.g., Knitwaves, Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd., 71 F.3d 996, 1012 (2d Cir.\n\n1995) (vacating fee award). TMTV does not dispute that the statute\n\nbarred such a recovery on TMTV's own claims against the defendants.\n\n          Instead, TMTV argues that it was also the prevailing\n\nparty as to Logroño's counterclaim, and so entitled to recover its\n\nattorneys' fees attributable to defending against this claim.   The\n\nargument--unpromising in any event--is forfeit, Dillon v. Select\n\nPortfolio Servicing, 630 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2011), having first\n\nbeen made in a motion for reconsideration of the district court's\n\ndenial of TMTV's request for attorneys' fees.\n\n          The district court's judgment is affirmed.   Each side is\n\nto bear its own costs on these cross-appeals.\n\n          It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                               -22-\n\f",

On one side is TMTV, Corp., a successor in interest to the first sitcom's production company; on the other, the second sitcom's production company, Mass Productions, Inc., and its principalsincluding the star of both shows, Emmanuel \"Sunshine\" Logroño. The district court granted summary judgment to TMTV on its claim charging infringement; and a jury granted it substantial damages, which the district court reduced by an amount recovered by TMTV in settlement of related litigation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*467</span> A summary of events and prior proceedings will suffice. In 1997, Antonio Mojenaan established television producer in Puerto Ricoapproached two veteran entertainersSunshine Logroño and Iris Chacónabout co-hosting a variety show on Puerto Rican television. The show would be called <i>De Noche con Iris y Sunshine</i> and would begin with four two-hour episodes, continuing thereafter if it proved popular. Chacón and Logroño both agreed to participate.</p>\n<p>During Mojena's initial pitch, he and Logroño discussed filling some of the two-hour episodes of <i>De Noche con Iris y Sunshine</i> with comedy segments. To that end, Logroño arranged a meeting in late September or early October 1997 with a team of comedians and scriptwriters, including scriptwriters Roberto Jiménez and Miguel Morales; Jiménez had worked with Logroño before, while Morales had not. At the meeting Jiménez suggested a sitcom centered on a condominium building and its residents. Logroño approved of the idea of setting a comedy segment in a condominium building, and the title <i>20 Pisos de Historia</i> (\"<i>20 Pisos</i>\") was chosen.</p>\n<p>The session produced a number of suggestions for <i>dramatis personae,</i> many modeled on preexisting characters taken from other projects involving the team. For example, a focus of the sitcom was to be a gossipy security guard in the lobby named \"Vázquez,\" who was based on a character Logroño played in a comedy segment in a previous television special, <i>Sunshine a la BBQ.</i> \"Soto,\" an older woman living alone, was drawn from a character in another prior Logroño show, <i>La Tripletta.</i> These and like adaptations were used when the sitcom was aired.</p>\n<p>After this discussion of ideas, Logroño asked Morales to write scripts for two of the first three episodes of <i>20 Pisos</i> and Jiménez to write the third. Logroño's recollection was that he framed the plots of all three, and Morales and Jiménez merely prepared dialogue to conform to Logroño's storylines. By contrast, Morales claims that he wrote the two scripts at home, by himself, based on the general concepts aired at the meeting; similarly, Jiménez claims to have taken the general ideas from the session and fixed them in writing for the first time.</p>\n<p>The writers delivered their scripts to Logroño, who retyped all three using special screen-writing software. On the cover pages, Logroño listed Morales as the author of episodes one and three and Jiménez as the author of episode two. Logroño claims to have made substantial changes in the scripts given to him, but the trail of drafts shows only minimal editing. And while Logroño appears to have co-written a number of later scripts for <i>20 Pisos,</i> these reflected themes and characters set up in the first three episodes.</p>\n<p>The first episode of <i>20 Pisos</i> aired on the inaugural broadcast of the variety show, <i>De Noche con Iris y Sunshine,</i> on November 7, 1997. The show was produced by Creative Relief Corp.a business wholly owned by Mojenaand broadcast in Puerto Rico by the WKAQ television station, an affiliate of the Telemundo network. The early episodes were successful and the variety showand the <i>20 Pisos</i> sitcom within itbecame a recurring weekly program for almost two years (although renamed after Chacón left).</p>\n<p>In December 1999, Logroño decamped from WKAQ for a rival television stationWAPA, an affiliate of Televicentrowhere he starred in a new sitcom produced by Mass Productions (a company controlled by Logroño and his wife), titled <i>El Condominio.</i> The new show, which began airing on WAPA in March 2000, featured many of the same actors as <i>20 Pisos.</i> The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*468</span> show retained the old characters and the sitcom unfolded in a virtually identical condominium setting, although new stories were developed and some new characters added.</p>\n<p>On March 15, 2000, TMTV brought a copyright infringement action in federal district court against Logroño, his wife, and their production company, Mass Productions.<sup>[1]</sup> The suit sought a declaratory judgment and various other legal and equitable remedies. Logroño filed an answer and counterclaim, asserting that he was the sole owner of the copyright to the outlines, scripts, and characters used for <i>20 Pisos</i> and that he was owed royalty payments for the use of these properties by TMTV.</p>\n<p>In due course, the district court granted summary judgment in the plaintiff's favor. <i>TMTV, Corp. v. Mass Prods., Inc.</i> (<i>TMTV I</i>), 345 F.Supp.2d 196 (D.P.R.2004). The court held that Morales and Jiménez had authored the first three scripts of <i>20 Pisos</i> pursuant to valid work-for-hire agreements with TMTV's predecessor in interest and that all later episodes of <i>20 Pisos</i> were derivative of the first three. <i>Id.</i> at 204-08. As to infringement, the district court found <i>20 Pisos</i> and <i>El Condominio</i> virtually identical. <i>Id.</i> at 213.</p>\n<p>In December 2004, a month or so after this decision, Televicentrothe network on which <i>El Condominio</i> was broadcastsought unsuccessfully to intervene and to have the partial summary judgment set aside. In August 2005, TMTV sought to consolidate its own suit with two others now pending before another district judge: an infringement suit by TMTV against Televicentro for broadcasting <i>El Condominio</i> and a suit against TMTV by a group of actors claiming copyright in the characters they had portrayed in <i>20 Pisos.</i> This motion too was denied.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, Logroño made his own failed attempt to undo the liability ruling against the defendants by claiming that the scriptwriters' work-for-hire agreements with TMTV were invalid. <i>TMTV, Corp. v. Mass Prods., Inc.</i> (<i>TMTV II</i>), 453 F.Supp.2d 378, 382-83 (D.P.R.2006). He also sought, unsuccessfully, to forestall a trial on damages by arguing that a private intervening settlement of the suit by TMTV against Televicentro meant that any further award to TMTV would be an impermissible double recovery.</p>\n<p>Prior to the trial, TMTV elected to claim only its actual damages (and not the defendants' profits or statutory damages). <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 504 (2006). TMTV's expert witness, economist Michael Einhorn, estimated damages as at least $4.9 million, based on licensing fees TMTV allegedly would have earned but for the infringement by the defendants; this was measured in part by licensing fees actually earned by another comparable sitcom on Puerto Rican television. The jury awarded TMTV $772,079.29.</p>\n<p>Following the verdict, the district court, over TMTV's objection, reduced the award by $700,000, representing the amount that TMTV had received in settlement from Televicentro. The court awarded TMTV prejudgment interest at the local-court rate of 5 percent per annum on the original jury verdict up through the date of the Televicentro settlement and, from then on, on the much smaller balance. Finally, the court denied TMTV's request for attorneys' fees as barred by the registration requirement of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 412.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*469</span> Both parties filed timely appeals, and we begin with Logroño's challenges to the summary judgmentmost importantly, his attack on the infringement ruling against him and his co-defendants. That ruling in turn required that TMTV show both ownership of a validly copyrighted work and improper copying of the protected elements of that work. <i>Yankee Candle Co. v. Bridgewater Candle Co.,</i> 259 F.3d 25, 33 (1st Cir.2001). Our review of the summary judgment ruling is <i>de novo.</i></p>\n<p>Since TMTV's claim to copyright runs through Jiménez and Morales, the first question is whether they or Logroño should be viewed as the creator of the original scripts. Jiménez and Morales say that once the condominium setting was agreed upon, they wrote the initial three scripts, framing the plots and dialogue and drawing in part on stock characters used in previous projects in which the team had participated. Logroño says that he outlined the plots and rewrote the scripts.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, a credibility contest means that the case must be tried but, in this instance, Logroño's claim to have substantially rewritten the scripts is refuted by comparing the originals and the final product. As for Logroño's supposed outlining of the plots, he has pointed to no writingneither any written outline by him nor any notes taken by anyone at the original meetingthat reflects anything like an outline of the scripts. At best, Logroño's version would mean that he suggested some general ideas for plots and possible stock characters for the initial scripts.</p>\n<p>One of the axiomatic requirements for copyright is that the author's work be \"fixed.\" 17 U.S.C. § 102(a). Copyright is a protection afforded to the definite expression of ideas but not the ideas themselves. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid,</i> 490 U.S. 730, 737, 109 S.Ct. 2166, 104 L.Ed.2d 811 (1989); <i>Erickson v. Trinity Theatre, Inc.,</i> 13 F.3d 1061, 1071 (7th Cir.1994). On this record, the district court properly found that there was no case on liability for a jury. <i>Scott v. Harris,</i> 550 U.S. 372, 380, 127 S.Ct. 1769, 167 L.Ed.2d 686 (2007).<sup>[2]</sup></p>\n<p>Logroño claims to have suggested the security guard and other characters; but nothing in the record indicates that they had the delineation needed to make them subject to copyright. Stock characters, like stock <i>scènes à faire,</i> are not subject to copyright protection. <i>Nichols v. Universal Pictures Corp.,</i> 45 F.2d 119, 121 (2d Cir.1930), <i>cert. denied,</i> 282 U.S. 902, 51 S.Ct. 216, 75 L.Ed. 795 (1931); 1 P. Goldstein, <i>Goldstein on Copyright</i> § 2.7.2, at 2:91-93 (3d ed. 2005); <i>cf. </i><i>Coquico, Inc. v. Rodríguez-Miranda,</i> 562 F.3d 62, 68 (1st Cir.2009). So even if Logroño suggested general plot ideas and stock characters, his claim to authorship of the scripts still fails.</p>\n<p>Positing Jiménez and Morales as the authors, ownership must still be traced to TMTV. Although the copyright ordinarily vests in the initial author or authors, 17 U.S.C. § 201(a), TMTV claims that the three scripts fall within the work \"made for hire\" rubric, <i>id.</i> § 201(b), meaning that the original production company would be considered the author. The district court agreed and, the original production company having assigned its rights to TMTV, the court treated TMTV as the copyright owner. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*470</span> <i>TMTV II,</i> 453 F.Supp.2d at 381-82; <i>TMTV I,</i> 345 F.Supp.2d at 206-07.</p>\n<p>Jiménez and Morales confirmed in depositions that this was their own oral understanding with the production company; but the statute requires express agreement in a signed written instrument, <i>see</i> 17 U.S.C. § 101 (definition); and the circuits are divided as to whether the language and policy require the writing before the creation or at least the completion of the work.<sup>[3]</sup> But even assuming that the rights remained with the scriptwriters, before this case began they conveyed (in writing, 17 U.S.C. § 204(a)) whatever rights they had to TMTV. We may rely on this assignment even though the district court did not. <i>Torres v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> 219 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p>Logroño next argues that he participated heavily in writing <i>later</i> scripts and that the district court's conclusion that these scripts were derivative works of the first three was cursory and unsupported. <i>See </i><i>TMTV I,</i> 345 F.Supp.2d at 207-08. But this was not his theory in the district court and so is forfeit, <i>Santiago-Sepúlveda v. Esso Standard Oil Co. (P.R.),</i> 643 F.3d 1, 1 (1st Cir.2011); nor, given the full scale development of the show in the first three scripts, would this new take be persuasive.</p>\n<p>The second element in the liability claim is infringement, which requires proof that actual copying occurred and that the copying was so extensive that the two works are \"substantially similar.\" <i>Segrets, Inc. v. Gillman Knitwear Co.,</i> 207 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 531 U.S. 827, 121 S.Ct. 76, 148 L.Ed.2d 39 (2000). However, Logroño obviously had access to the original scripts and based <i>El Condominio</i> upon them, bringing with him a number of the actors. The initial episode of <i>El Condominio</i> mentioned the characters' move to a new building; and the <i>El Condominio</i> advertising campaign invited viewers to reconnect with their favorite characters at a new location.</p>\n<p>So copying is not in doubt and the issue is substantial similarity, which requires comparing the <i>expressive</i> elements of the copyrighted work contributed by the authorthe components alone subject to copyright protectionwith those of the allegedly infringing work. <i>Yankee Candle,</i> 259 F.3d at 33. No infringement claim lies if the similarity between two works rests necessarily on non-copyrightable aspects of the originalfor example, \"the underlying ideas, or expressions that are not original with the plaintiff.\" <i>Matthews v. Freedman,</i> 157 F.3d 25, 27 (1st Cir.1998); <i>accord </i><i>Johnson v. Gordon,</i> 409 F.3d 12, 19 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p>Infringement can occur wherewithout copying a single linethe later author borrows wholesale the entire backdrop, characters, inter-relationships, genre, and plot design of an earlier work.<sup>[4]</sup><span class=\"star-pagination\">*471</span> Imagine, for example, that the first Sherlock Holmes stories had been penned and copyrighted last year by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and Logroño had then written his own sequels carrying everything forward into a new plot. <i>See, e.g., Anderson v. Stallone,</i> No. 87-0592 WDKGX, 1989 WL 206431, at *8 (C.D.Cal. Apr. 25, 1989). Here, we agree with the district court that</p>\n<blockquote>the similarities between the two programs are so striking that there is no doubt that \"El Condominio\" is . . . an unauthorized derivative work. In effect. . . both programs are the same with only a difference in name and transmitted via a different channel. Specifically, the setting, character names, costumes, character interactions, comedy line, mood, [and] camera angles are almost identical in both sitcoms.</blockquote>\n<p><i>TMTV I,</i> 345 F.Supp.2d at 213.</p>\n<p>Logroño's claimed differences between the two shows are not significant. For example, although the action in <i>El Condominio</i> unfolds largely in a condominium building lobby virtually identical to the lobby setting in <i>20 Pisos,</i> the second sitcom also added some scenes in a laundry room and the handyman's space; so, too, some characters are given more dialogue or minor variations in character traits (<i>e.g.,</i> a new hearing problem). Such trivial modifications are not a defense. <i>Cf. </i><i>Coquico,</i> 562 F.3d at 68; <i>Matthews,</i> 157 F.3d at 28.</p>\n<p>Liability for copyright violation being established, we turn to damages. The jury awarded $772,079, but the district judge reduced this figure by $700,000 for the settlement payment TMTV received from Televicentro. Logroño argues that <i>all</i> of the damages awarded by the jury should have been erased by the settlement; TMTV, as cross-appellant, claims that <i>none</i> of the damages awarded by the jury should have been reduced by the settlement payment.</p>\n<p>The acts of infringement by the defendants and by Televicentro are not identical but they are entangled: Logroño and his production company produced the infringing <i>El Condominio</i> programs and Televicentro broadcast them. In this case, TMTV's theory of damages at trial was that the infringement diverted from TMTV potential licensing royalties; this was patently a claim for plaintiff's damages rather than defendants' profits.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>We start with the defendants' claims. The defendants make two different arguments for their view that the prior TMTV-Televicentro settlement barred any recovery at trial. The first is that the settlement constituted a release of claims against any available party who could be charged with infringement based on the same episode; the second, that the judgment entered upon the settlement is <i>res judicata,</i> precluding any further claims against the defendants.</p>\n<p>Older common law doctrine tended toward the view that a settlement with one tortfeasor extinguished claims against other joint tortfeasors responsible for the same harmalthough who was a joint tortfeasor and what constituted the same <span class=\"star-pagination\">*472</span> harm could be fraught questions; but the modern view is strongly in favor of treating a settlement with one joint tortfeasor as releasing the others only if the parties to the settlement so intended; otherwise, the settlement becomes an offset against later judgments if needed to avoid double recovery.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The TMTV-Televicentro settlement, as an agreement, is arguably interpreted under Puerto Rico law, <i>Great Clips, Inc. v. Hair Cuttery of Greater Bos., L.L.C.,</i> 591 F.3d 32, 35 (1st Cir.2010), although federal law might be thought to bear on whether a federal judgment incorporating a settlement should reduce a later federal judgment on a federal claim, <i>Singer v. Olympia Brewing Co.,</i> 878 F.2d 596, 599-600 (2d Cir.1989), <i>cert. denied,</i> 493 U.S. 1024, 110 S.Ct. 729, 107 L.Ed.2d 748 (1990). But the question of which law applies is academic here, because both Puerto Rico and federal law follow the modern approach in looking to the intent of those who made the settlement.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>The defendants claim that TMTV's acceptance of the settlement payment bespeaks an intent to relinquish claims against non-settling tortfeasors, absent an express reservation of rights. In some situations, a settlement with a joint tortfeasor might suggest such an intent, <i>see</i> Keeton, <i>supra,</i> § 49, at 335for example, a release discharging \"any and all persons\" potentially liable on the stated claims. But the opposite is often more plausible: frequently, the plaintiff gives a break to the first settling defendant, puts some money in the bank, and aims for a higher judgment against non-settling defendants. If the release were for all, a larger settlement would be demanded.</p>\n<p>Here, the settlement itself was apparently oral and TMTV denies any such intent to release others besides Televicentro. The defendantson whom the burden of proof falls to prove release, Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(c)point to nothing to suggest that Televicentro had such an intent. Indeed, the defendants do not even suggest a plausible reason why Televicentro should have wished to pay a larger settlement in order to protect the defendants in this case.</p>\n<p>Turning then to the <i>judgment</i> entered pursuant to the Televicentro settlement, it says that the $700,000 payment is made \"in satisfaction of all causes of action identified in the Complaint [against Televicentro] and its amendments.\" The claims in that complaint identified acts by Televicentro, including the broadcast of episodes of <i>El Condominio,</i> as alleged violations of TMTV's copyright based on the original scripts; but the complaint asserted no claims against the present defendants based on their production of the shows.</p>\n<p>A judgment has the meaning (objectively determined) intended by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*473</span> court that framed and entered it, <i>cf. </i><i>Concilio de Salud Integral de Loíza, Inc. v. Perez-Perdomo,</i> 625 F.3d 15, 19-20 (1st Cir.2010); but where the judgment is based on a settlement, courts may look to the intent of the settling parties, 18A C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 4443, at 262 (2d ed. 2002); <i>cf. </i><i>Hermes Automation Tech., Inc. v. Hyundai Elecs. Indus. Co.,</i> 915 F.2d 739, 751 n. 10 (1st Cir.1990). Here, nothing shows that either the judge who entered the prior judgment or the parties to that case intended to release anyone else.</p>\n<p>The result is the same if the settlement aspect is ignored and formal res judicata rules are applied to the judgment. Because no issues were adjudicated in the settled case, issue preclusion is irrelevant and the concern is only with claim preclusion. Classically, claim preclusion applies only where there is (1) a prior final judgment on the merits (2) on the same or sufficiently identical claims (3) between the same parties or their privies. <i>Airframe Sys., Inc. v. Raytheon Co.,</i> 601 F.3d 9, 14 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>Whether or not the defendants are treated as joint tortfeasors, they were not parties to the settled case and are not in privity with Televicentro. <i>See </i><i>Taylor v. Sturgell,</i> 553 U.S. 880, 894, 128 S.Ct. 2161, 171 L.Ed.2d 155 (2008). Claim preclusion extends beyond parties and their privies only in unusual circumstances;<sup>[8]</sup> consider, for example, a plaintiff, unsuccessful against an initial defendant, seeking to litigate identical claims against new but closely related defendants. <i>Negrón-Fuentes v. UPS Supply Chain Solutions,</i> 532 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Eliminating entirely the party or privy condition would require that whenever a plaintiff sued a defendant, the plaintiff also sue in the same action all other defendants against whom the plaintiff might have related claims. No such compulsory joinder requirement appears in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or elsewhere. <i>Cf. Restatement (Second) of Judgments, supra,</i> § 49. If such a rule were ever adoptedand this itself would be a debatable choicefairness would require advance warning to potential plaintiffs and probably major qualifications on the requirement itself.</p>\n<p>As for TMTV's objection to the offset, the modern view, as already stated, is that an offset is conventional where needed to prevent recovering twice for the same harm. There are other solutions apart from a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the judgment by the amount of the settlement, including a more complex proportional regime that the Supreme Court has employed in admiralty cases. <i>See </i><i>McDermott,</i> 511 U.S. at 211-17, 114 S.Ct. 1461; <i>cf. </i><i>Río Mar Assocs.,</i> 522 F.3d at 166-67 (Puerto Rico law). But neither side argues here that some other method should be used.</p>\n<p>Rather, TMTV's claim is that the reduction is not warranted because (it asserts) the settlement was for a different harm, in that Logroño prepared a derivative work, 17 U.S.C. § 106(2), while Televicentro publicly transmitted it, <i>id.</i> § 106(4). True, some of the infringing acts differed: Logroño acted and wrote scripts; the television company broadcast the programs. But the damages were (on TMTV's own theory) the same harm: the lost royalties that could have been earned by TMTV for the production and broadcast of the <i>El</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*474</span> <i>Condominio</i> programs if TMTV's right had been respected instead of infringed. Production and broadcast were two necessary, sequential steps needed to cause the <i>same</i> damage.</p>\n<p>TMTV also says that the Televicentro settlement was for Televicentro's profits rather than TMTV's damages. Although damage liability is joint and several, <i>Screen Gems,</i> 453 F.2d at 554, liability for <i>profits</i> is several only, <i>MCA, Inc. v. Wilson,</i> 677 F.2d 180, 186 (2d Cir.1981).<sup>[9]</sup> But nothing supports TMTV's claim that the Televicentro settlement was, <i>sub silentio,</i> restitution of profits but not compensation of actual damages. Indeed, the damage expert in both cases was the same. In sum, the district court's treatment of the settlement was correct.</p>\n<p>The defendants argue lastly that the district court erred in its award of prejudgment interest (5 percent on the full jury damage award up to settlement and thereafter only on the balance). The defendants say that the Copyright Act does not authorize the award of prejudgment interest and that, if the statute does permit such an award, the equities do not favor an award here or at least the award should have been made at a lower rate of interest.</p>\n<p>The Copyright Act does not expressly authorize prejudgment interest but authority for such an award can be inferred, where appropriate, from congressional purpose and general principles. <i>Rodgers v. United States,</i> 332 U.S. 371, 373, 68 S.Ct. 5, 92 L.Ed. 3 (1947). Here, as actual damages were calculated, TMTV was deprived of royalties that would have been due had the defendants produced the infringing programs under license. Prejudgment interest dating from the infringements compensated the plaintiff for the time value of monies it should have hadjust as if a contract debt had not been paid on time.</p>\n<p>Conversely, the defendants had the use of additional fundswhatever portion of their assets corresponded to such royaltiesduring the period before the judgment, so an award of prejudgment interest also avoids unjust enrichment. <i>Cf. </i><i>Frank Music Corp. v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.,</i> 886 F.2d 1545, 1552 (9th Cir.1989), <i>cert. denied,</i> 494 U.S. 1017, 110 S.Ct. 1321, 108 L.Ed.2d 496 (1990). Because the Televicentro settlement provided TMTV with most of the deficiency from that time forward, the defendants' interest obligations on the reduced balance give them a slight windfallalthough not at TMTV's expense.</p>\n<p>Our own case law treats an award of prejudgment interest in such cases as a matter for the informed discretion of the district court. <i>See </i><i>John G. Danielson, Inc. v. Winchester-Conant Props., Inc.,</i> 322 F.3d 26, 51 (1st Cir.2003).<sup>[10]</sup> Given the range of circumstances and the mix of motives for such awards, this flexibility may make sense. Certainly on the present <span class=\"star-pagination\">*475</span> facts there was no abuse of discretion in making the award or in limiting it in the fashion adopted by the district judge.</p>\n<p>For <i>post-judgment</i> interest on federal judgments, a uniform federal rate applies by statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1961 (2006) (weekly average yield of one-year constant maturity treasury bills), but no default federal rate exists for prejudgment interest; here, the district judge applied the prevailing rate of 5 percent used in Puerto Rico courts for both pre- and post-judgment interest. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, App. III, R. 44.3 (2000). The federal post-judgment section 1961 interest rate would have been approximately 0.5 percent when judgment was entered in January 2009.</p>\n<p>The defendants claim that it was obligatory or at least more equitable to use the lower federal rate even though it is designed for post-judgment interest. The considerations are somewhat different where, absent a stay or bond, the successful plaintiff can effectively require prompt payment, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 64(b), and the present federal rate is depressed by current monetary policy designed to combat recession. The choice of the local rate, like the award itself, was within the sound discretion of the district judge. <i>E.g., </i><i>Colon Velez v. P.R. Marine Mgmt., Inc.,</i> 957 F.2d 933, 941 (1st Cir.1992). Five percent is by historical standards hardly exorbitant.</p>\n<p>The last issue is attorneys' fees. Ordinarily, the prevailing party in a copyright case can be awarded fees \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by\" the statute. 17 U.S.C. § 505. Here, such an award was barred by statute because the copyright for the scripts was not registered in a timely fashion. <i>Id.</i> § 412; <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Knitwaves, Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd.,</i> 71 F.3d 996, 1012 (2d Cir.1995) (vacating fee award). TMTV does not dispute that the statute barred such a recovery on TMTV's own claims against the defendants.</p>\n<p>Instead, TMTV argues that it was <i>also</i> the prevailing party as to Logroño's counterclaim, and so entitled to recover its attorneys' fees attributable to defending against this claim. The argumentunpromising in any eventis forfeit, <i>Dillon v. Select Portfolio Servicing,</i> 630 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir.2011), having first been made in a motion for reconsideration of the district court's denial of TMTV's request for attorneys' fees.</p>\n<p>The district court's judgment is <i>affirmed.</i> Each side is to bear its own costs on these cross-appeals.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon.

On one side is TMTV, Corp., a successor in interest to the first sitcom's production company; on the other, the second sitcom's production company, Mass Productions, Inc., and its principalsincluding the star of both shows, Emmanuel \"Sunshine\" Logroño. The district court granted summary judgment to TMTV on its claim charging infringement; and a jury granted it substantial damages, which the district court reduced by an amount recovered by TMTV in settlement of related litigation.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*467</span> A summary of events and prior proceedings will suffice. In 1997, Antonio Mojenaan established television producer in Puerto Ricoapproached two veteran entertainersSunshine Logroño and Iris Chacónabout co-hosting a variety show on Puerto Rican television. The show would be called <i>De Noche con Iris y Sunshine</i> and would begin with four two-hour episodes, continuing thereafter if it proved popular. Chacón and Logroño both agreed to participate.</p>\n<p>During Mojena's initial pitch, he and Logroño discussed filling some of the two-hour episodes of <i>De Noche con Iris y Sunshine</i> with comedy segments. To that end, Logroño arranged a meeting in late September or early October 1997 with a team of comedians and scriptwriters, including scriptwriters Roberto Jiménez and Miguel Morales; Jiménez had worked with Logroño before, while Morales had not. At the meeting Jiménez suggested a sitcom centered on a condominium building and its residents. Logroño approved of the idea of setting a comedy segment in a condominium building, and the title <i>20 Pisos de Historia</i> (\"<i>20 Pisos</i>\") was chosen.</p>\n<p>The session produced a number of suggestions for <i>dramatis personae,</i> many modeled on preexisting characters taken from other projects involving the team. For example, a focus of the sitcom was to be a gossipy security guard in the lobby named \"Vázquez,\" who was based on a character Logroño played in a comedy segment in a previous television special, <i>Sunshine a la BBQ.</i> \"Soto,\" an older woman living alone, was drawn from a character in another prior Logroño show, <i>La Tripletta.</i> These and like adaptations were used when the sitcom was aired.</p>\n<p>After this discussion of ideas, Logroño asked Morales to write scripts for two of the first three episodes of <i>20 Pisos</i> and Jiménez to write the third. Logroño's recollection was that he framed the plots of all three, and Morales and Jiménez merely prepared dialogue to conform to Logroño's storylines. By contrast, Morales claims that he wrote the two scripts at home, by himself, based on the general concepts aired at the meeting; similarly, Jiménez claims to have taken the general ideas from the session and fixed them in writing for the first time.</p>\n<p>The writers delivered their scripts to Logroño, who retyped all three using special screen-writing software. On the cover pages, Logroño listed Morales as the author of episodes one and three and Jiménez as the author of episode two. Logroño claims to have made substantial changes in the scripts given to him, but the trail of drafts shows only minimal editing. And while Logroño appears to have co-written a number of later scripts for <i>20 Pisos,</i> these reflected themes and characters set up in the first three episodes.</p>\n<p>The first episode of <i>20 Pisos</i> aired on the inaugural broadcast of the variety show, <i>De Noche con Iris y Sunshine,</i> on November 7, 1997. The show was produced by Creative Relief Corp.a business wholly owned by Mojenaand broadcast in Puerto Rico by the WKAQ television station, an affiliate of the Telemundo network. The early episodes were successful and the variety showand the <i>20 Pisos</i> sitcom within itbecame a recurring weekly program for almost two years (although renamed after Chacón left).</p>\n<p>In December 1999, Logroño decamped from WKAQ for a rival television stationWAPA, an affiliate of Televicentrowhere he starred in a new sitcom produced by Mass Productions (a company controlled by Logroño and his wife), titled <i>El Condominio.</i> The new show, which began airing on WAPA in March 2000, featured many of the same actors as <i>20 Pisos.</i> The <span class=\"star-pagination\">*468</span> show retained the old characters and the sitcom unfolded in a virtually identical condominium setting, although new stories were developed and some new characters added.</p>\n<p>On March 15, 2000, TMTV brought a copyright infringement action in federal district court against Logroño, his wife, and their production company, Mass Productions.<sup>[1]</sup> The suit sought a declaratory judgment and various other legal and equitable remedies. Logroño filed an answer and counterclaim, asserting that he was the sole owner of the copyright to the outlines, scripts, and characters used for <i>20 Pisos</i> and that he was owed royalty payments for the use of these properties by TMTV.</p>\n<p>In due course, the district court granted summary judgment in the plaintiff's favor. <i>TMTV, Corp. v. Mass Prods., Inc.</i> (<i>TMTV I</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2572831\"><a href=\"/opinion/2572831/tmtv-corp-v-mass-productions-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">345</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span> (D.P.R.2004). The court held that Morales and Jiménez had authored the first three scripts of <i>20 Pisos</i> pursuant to valid work-for-hire agreements with TMTV's predecessor in interest and that all later episodes of <i>20 Pisos</i> were derivative of the first three. <i>Id.</i> at 204-08. As to infringement, the district court found <i>20 Pisos</i> and <i>El Condominio</i> virtually identical. <i>Id.</i> at 213.</p>\n<p>In December 2004, a month or so after this decision, Televicentrothe network on which <i>El Condominio</i> was broadcastsought unsuccessfully to intervene and to have the partial summary judgment set aside. In August 2005, TMTV sought to consolidate its own suit with two others now pending before another district judge: an infringement suit by TMTV against Televicentro for broadcasting <i>El Condominio</i> and a suit against TMTV by a group of actors claiming copyright in the characters they had portrayed in <i>20 Pisos.</i> This motion too was denied.</p>\n<p>Thereafter, Logroño made his own failed attempt to undo the liability ruling against the defendants by claiming that the scriptwriters' work-for-hire agreements with TMTV were invalid. <i>TMTV, Corp. v. Mass Prods., Inc.</i> (<i>TMTV II</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2475416\"><a href=\"/opinion/2475416/tmtv-corp-v-mass-productions-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">378</span></a></span>, 382-83 (D.P.R.2006). He also sought, unsuccessfully, to forestall a trial on damages by arguing that a private intervening settlement of the suit by TMTV against Televicentro meant that any further award to TMTV would be an impermissible double recovery.</p>\n<p>Prior to the trial, TMTV elected to claim only its actual damages (and not the defendants' profits or statutory damages). <i>See</i> 17 U.S.C. § 504 (2006). TMTV's expert witness, economist Michael Einhorn, estimated damages as at least $4.9 million, based on licensing fees TMTV allegedly would have earned but for the infringement by the defendants; this was measured in part by licensing fees actually earned by another comparable sitcom on Puerto Rican television. The jury awarded TMTV $772,079.29.</p>\n<p>Following the verdict, the district court, over TMTV's objection, reduced the award by $700,000, representing the amount that TMTV had received in settlement from Televicentro. The court awarded TMTV prejudgment interest at the local-court rate of 5 percent per annum on the original jury verdict up through the date of the Televicentro settlement and, from then on, on the much smaller balance. Finally, the court denied TMTV's request for attorneys' fees as barred by the registration requirement of the Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. § 412.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*469</span> Both parties filed timely appeals, and we begin with Logroño's challenges to the summary judgmentmost importantly, his attack on the infringement ruling against him and his co-defendants. That ruling in turn required that TMTV show both ownership of a validly copyrighted work and improper copying of the protected elements of that work. <i>Yankee Candle Co. v. Bridgewater Candle Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774264\"><a href=\"/opinion/774264/the-yankee-candle-company-inc-v-the-bridgewater-candle-company-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.2001). Our review of the summary judgment ruling is <i>de novo.</i></p>\n<p>Since TMTV's claim to copyright runs through Jiménez and Morales, the first question is whether they or Logroño should be viewed as the creator of the original scripts. Jiménez and Morales say that once the condominium setting was agreed upon, they wrote the initial three scripts, framing the plots and dialogue and drawing in part on stock characters used in previous projects in which the team had participated. Logroño says that he outlined the plots and rewrote the scripts.</p>\n<p>Ordinarily, a credibility contest means that the case must be tried but, in this instance, Logroño's claim to have substantially rewritten the scripts is refuted by comparing the originals and the final product. As for Logroño's supposed outlining of the plots, he has pointed to no writingneither any written outline by him nor any notes taken by anyone at the original meetingthat reflects anything like an outline of the scripts. At best, Logroño's version would mean that he suggested some general ideas for plots and possible stock characters for the initial scripts.</p>\n<p>One of the axiomatic requirements for copyright is that the author's work be \"fixed.\" 17 U.S.C. § 102(a). Copyright is a protection afforded to the definite expression of ideas but not the ideas themselves. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cmty. for Creative Non-Violence v. Reid,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112273\"><a href=\"/opinion/112273/community-for-creative-non-violence-v-reid/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">730</span></a></span>, 737, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112273\"><a href=\"/opinion/112273/community-for-creative-non-violence-v-reid/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Stock characters, like stock <i>scènes à faire,</i> are not subject to copyright protection. <i>Nichols v.

So even if Logroño suggested general plot ideas and stock characters, his claim to authorship of the scripts still fails.</p>\n<p>Positing Jiménez and Morales as the authors, ownership must still be traced to TMTV. Although the copyright ordinarily vests in the initial author or authors, 17 U.S.C. § 201(a), TMTV claims that the three scripts fall within the work \"made for hire\" rubric, <i>id.</i> § 201(b), meaning that the original production company would be considered the author. The district court agreed and, the original production company having assigned its rights to TMTV, the court treated TMTV as the copyright owner. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*470</span> <i>TMTV II,</i> 453 F.Supp.2d at 381-82; <i>TMTV I,</i> 345 F.Supp.2d at 206-07.</p>\n<p>Jiménez and Morales confirmed in depositions that this was their own oral understanding with the production company; but the statute requires express agreement in a signed written instrument, <i>see</i> 17 U.S.C. § 101 (definition); and the circuits are divided as to whether the language and policy require the writing before the creation or at least the completion of the work.<sup>[3]</sup> But even assuming that the rights remained with the scriptwriters, before this case began they conveyed (in writing, 17 U.S.C. § 204(a)) whatever rights they had to TMTV. We may rely on this assignment even though the district court did not. <i>Torres v. E.I. Dupont De Nemours &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199000\"><a href=\"/opinion/199000/torres-v-ei-dupont/\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 18 (1st Cir. 2000).</p>\n<p>Logroño next argues that he participated heavily in writing <i>later</i> scripts and that the district court's conclusion that these scripts were derivative works of the first three was cursory and unsupported. <i>See </i><i>TMTV I,</i> 345 F.Supp.2d at 207-08. But this was not his theory in the district court and so is forfeit, <i>Santiago-Sepúlveda v. Esso Standard Oil Co. (P.R.),</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">643</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 1 (1st Cir.2011); nor, given the full scale development of the show in the first three scripts, would this new take be persuasive.</p>\n<p>The second element in the liability claim is infringement, which requires proof that actual copying occurred and that the copying was so extensive that the two works are \"substantially similar.\" <i>Segrets, Inc. v. Gillman Knitwear Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768061\"><a href=\"/opinion/768061/segrets-inc-v-gillman-knitwear-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">207</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">531</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">39</span></span> (2000). However, Logroño obviously had access to the original scripts and based <i>El Condominio</i> upon them, bringing with him a number of the actors. The initial episode of <i>El Condominio</i> mentioned the characters' move to a new building; and the <i>El Condominio</i> advertising campaign invited viewers to reconnect with their favorite characters at a new location.</p>\n<p>So copying is not in doubt and the issue is substantial similarity, which requires comparing the <i>expressive</i> elements of the copyrighted work contributed by the authorthe components alone subject to copyright protectionwith those of the allegedly infringing work. <i>Yankee Candle,</i> 259 F.3d at 33. No infringement claim lies if the similarity between two works rests necessarily on non-copyrightable aspects of the originalfor example, \"the underlying ideas, or expressions that are not original with the plaintiff.\" <i>Matthews v. Freedman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198159\"><a href=\"/opinion/198159/matthews-v-freedman/\"><span class=\"volume\">157</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.1998); <i>accord </i><i>Johnson v.

Stallone,</i> No. 87-0592 WDKGX, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1989</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">206431</span></span>, at *8 (C.D.Cal. Apr. 25, 1989). Here, we agree with the district court that</p>\n<blockquote>the similarities between the two programs are so striking that there is no doubt that \"El Condominio\" is . . . an unauthorized derivative work. In effect. . . both programs are the same with only a difference in name and transmitted via a different channel. Specifically, the setting, character names, costumes, character interactions, comedy line, mood, [and] camera angles are almost identical in both sitcoms.</blockquote>\n<p><i>TMTV I,</i> 345 F.Supp.2d at 213.</p>\n<p>Logroño's claimed differences between the two shows are not significant. For example, although the action in <i>El Condominio</i> unfolds largely in a condominium building lobby virtually identical to the lobby setting in <i>20 Pisos,</i> the second sitcom also added some scenes in a laundry room and the handyman's space; so, too, some characters are given more dialogue or minor variations in character traits (<i>e.g.,</i> a new hearing problem). Such trivial modifications are not a defense. <i>Cf. </i><i>Coquico,</i> 562 F.3d at 68; <i>Matthews,</i> 157 F.3d at 28.</p>\n<p>Liability for copyright violation being established, we turn to damages. The jury awarded $772,079, but the district judge reduced this figure by $700,000 for the settlement payment TMTV received from Televicentro. Logroño argues that <i>all</i> of the damages awarded by the jury should have been erased by the settlement; TMTV, as cross-appellant, claims that <i>none</i> of the damages awarded by the jury should have been reduced by the settlement payment.</p>\n<p>The acts of infringement by the defendants and by Televicentro are not identical but they are entangled: Logroño and his production company produced the infringing <i>El Condominio</i> programs and Televicentro broadcast them. In this case, TMTV's theory of damages at trial was that the infringement diverted from TMTV potential licensing royalties; this was patently a claim for plaintiff's damages rather than defendants' profits.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>We start with the defendants' claims. The defendants make two different arguments for their view that the prior TMTV-Televicentro settlement barred any recovery at trial. The first is that the settlement constituted a release of claims against any available party who could be charged with infringement based on the same episode; the second, that the judgment entered upon the settlement is <i>res judicata,</i> precluding any further claims against the defendants.</p>\n<p>Older common law doctrine tended toward the view that a settlement with one tortfeasor extinguished claims against other joint tortfeasors responsible for the same harmalthough who was a joint tortfeasor and what constituted the same <span class=\"star-pagination\">*472</span> harm could be fraught questions; but the modern view is strongly in favor of treating a settlement with one joint tortfeasor as releasing the others only if the parties to the settlement so intended; otherwise, the settlement becomes an offset against later judgments if needed to avoid double recovery.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The TMTV-Televicentro settlement, as an agreement, is arguably interpreted under Puerto Rico law, <i>Great Clips, Inc. v. Hair Cuttery of Greater Bos., L.L.C.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"204129\"><a href=\"/opinion/204129/great-clips-v-hair-cuttery-of-greater-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">591</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 35 (1st Cir.2010), although federal law might be thought to bear on whether a federal judgment incorporating a settlement should reduce a later federal judgment on a federal claim, <i>Singer v.

But the question of which law applies is academic here, because both Puerto Rico and federal law follow the modern approach in looking to the intent of those who made the settlement.<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>The defendants claim that TMTV's acceptance of the settlement payment bespeaks an intent to relinquish claims against non-settling tortfeasors, absent an express reservation of rights. In some situations, a settlement with a joint tortfeasor might suggest such an intent, <i>see</i> Keeton, <i>supra,</i> § 49, at 335for example, a release discharging \"any and all persons\" potentially liable on the stated claims. But the opposite is often more plausible: frequently, the plaintiff gives a break to the first settling defendant, puts some money in the bank, and aims for a higher judgment against non-settling defendants. If the release were for all, a larger settlement would be demanded.</p>\n<p>Here, the settlement itself was apparently oral and TMTV denies any such intent to release others besides Televicentro. The defendantson whom the burden of proof falls to prove release, Fed. R.Civ.P. 8(c)point to nothing to suggest that Televicentro had such an intent. Indeed, the defendants do not even suggest a plausible reason why Televicentro should have wished to pay a larger settlement in order to protect the defendants in this case.</p>\n<p>Turning then to the <i>judgment</i> entered pursuant to the Televicentro settlement, it says that the $700,000 payment is made \"in satisfaction of all causes of action identified in the Complaint [against Televicentro] and its amendments.\" The claims in that complaint identified acts by Televicentro, including the broadcast of episodes of <i>El Condominio,</i> as alleged violations of TMTV's copyright based on the original scripts; but the complaint asserted no claims against the present defendants based on their production of the shows.</p>\n<p>A judgment has the meaning (objectively determined) intended by the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*473</span> court that framed and entered it, <i>cf. </i><i>Concilio de Salud Integral de Loíza, Inc. v. Perez-Perdomo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"178154\"><a href=\"/opinion/178154/concilio-de-salud-integral-v-perez-perdomo/\"><span class=\"volume\">625</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 19-20 (1st Cir.2010); but where the judgment is based on a settlement, courts may look to the intent of the settling parties, 18A C. Wright, A. Miller &amp; E. Cooper, <i>Federal Practice and Procedure</i> § 4443, at 262 (2d ed. 2002); <i>cf. </i><i>Hermes Automation Tech., Inc. v. Hyundai Elecs. Indus. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548926\"><a href=\"/opinion/548926/hermes-automation-technology-inc-v-hyundai-electronics-industries-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">739</span></a></span>, 751 n. 10 (1st Cir.1990). Here, nothing shows that either the judge who entered the prior judgment or the parties to that case intended to release anyone else.</p>\n<p>The result is the same if the settlement aspect is ignored and formal res judicata rules are applied to the judgment. Because no issues were adjudicated in the settled case, issue preclusion is irrelevant and the concern is only with claim preclusion. Classically, claim preclusion applies only where there is (1) a prior final judgment on the merits (2) on the same or sufficiently identical claims (3) between the same parties or their privies. <i>Airframe Sys., Inc. v. Raytheon Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1001\"><a href=\"/opinion/1001/airframe-systems-inc-v-raytheon-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">601</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2010).</p>\n<p>Whether or not the defendants are treated as joint tortfeasors, they were not parties to the settled case and are not in privity with Televicentro. <i>See </i><i>Taylor v. Sturgell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145793\"><a href=\"/opinion/145793/taylor-v-sturgell/\"><span class=\"volume\">553</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">880</span></a></span>, 894, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145793\"><a href=\"/opinion/145793/taylor-v-sturgell/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2161</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145793\"><a href=\"/opinion/145793/taylor-v-sturgell/\"><span class=\"volume\">171</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span> (2008). Claim preclusion extends beyond parties and their privies only in unusual circumstances;<sup>[8]</sup> consider, for example, a plaintiff, unsuccessful against an initial defendant, seeking to litigate identical claims against new but closely related defendants. <i>Negrón-Fuentes v. UPS Supply Chain Solutions,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2008).</p>\n<p>Eliminating entirely the party or privy condition would require that whenever a plaintiff sued a defendant, the plaintiff also sue in the same action all other defendants against whom the plaintiff might have related claims. No such compulsory joinder requirement appears in the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure or elsewhere. <i>Cf. Restatement (Second) of Judgments, supra,</i> § 49. If such a rule were ever adoptedand this itself would be a debatable choicefairness would require advance warning to potential plaintiffs and probably major qualifications on the requirement itself.</p>\n<p>As for TMTV's objection to the offset, the modern view, as already stated, is that an offset is conventional where needed to prevent recovering twice for the same harm. There are other solutions apart from a dollar-for-dollar reduction of the judgment by the amount of the settlement, including a more complex proportional regime that the Supreme Court has employed in admiralty cases. <i>See </i><i>McDermott,</i> 511 U.S. at 211-17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117838\"><a href=\"/opinion/117838/mcdermott-inc-v-amclyde/\"><span class=\"volume\">114</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1461</span></a></span>; <i>cf. </i><i>Río Mar Assocs.,</i> 522 F.3d at 166-67 (Puerto Rico law). But neither side argues here that some other method should be used.</p>\n<p>Rather, TMTV's claim is that the reduction is not warranted because (it asserts) the settlement was for a different harm, in that Logroño prepared a derivative work, 17 U.S.C. § 106(2), while Televicentro publicly transmitted it, <i>id.</i> § 106(4). True, some of the infringing acts differed: Logroño acted and wrote scripts; the television company broadcast the programs. But the damages were (on TMTV's own theory) the same harm: the lost royalties that could have been earned by TMTV for the production and broadcast of the <i>El</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*474</span> <i>Condominio</i> programs if TMTV's right had been respected instead of infringed. Production and broadcast were two necessary, sequential steps needed to cause the <i>same</i> damage.</p>\n<p>TMTV also says that the Televicentro settlement was for Televicentro's profits rather than TMTV's damages. Although damage liability is joint and several, <i>Screen Gems,</i> 453 F.2d at 554, liability for <i>profits</i> is several only, <i>MCA, Inc. v. Wilson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"403548\"><a href=\"/opinion/403548/mca-inc-dba-mca-music-a-division-thereof-v-earl-wilson-jr-phil/\"><span class=\"volume\">677</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span>, 186 (2d Cir.1981).<sup>[9]</sup> But nothing supports TMTV's claim that the Televicentro settlement was, <i>sub silentio,</i> restitution of profits but not compensation of actual damages. Indeed, the damage expert in both cases was the same. In sum, the district court's treatment of the settlement was correct.</p>\n<p>The defendants argue lastly that the district court erred in its award of prejudgment interest (5 percent on the full jury damage award up to settlement and thereafter only on the balance). The defendants say that the Copyright Act does not authorize the award of prejudgment interest and that, if the statute does permit such an award, the equities do not favor an award here or at least the award should have been made at a lower rate of interest.</p>\n<p>The Copyright Act does not expressly authorize prejudgment interest but authority for such an award can be inferred, where appropriate, from congressional purpose and general principles. <i>Rodgers v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104470\"><a href=\"/opinion/104470/rodgers-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">371</span></a></span>, 373, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104470\"><a href=\"/opinion/104470/rodgers-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">68</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">3</span></a></span> (1947). Here, as actual damages were calculated, TMTV was deprived of royalties that would have been due had the defendants produced the infringing programs under license. Prejudgment interest dating from the infringements compensated the plaintiff for the time value of monies it should have hadjust as if a contract debt had not been paid on time.</p>\n<p>Conversely, the defendants had the use of additional fundswhatever portion of their assets corresponded to such royaltiesduring the period before the judgment, so an award of prejudgment interest also avoids unjust enrichment. <i>Cf. </i><i>Frank Music Corp. v. Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"530296\"><a href=\"/opinion/530296/frank-music-corp-robert-wright-george-forrest-anne-lederer-as-of-the-last/\"><span class=\"volume\">886</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1545</span></a></span>, 1552 (9th Cir.1989), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">494</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1017</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">496</span></span> (1990). Because the Televicentro settlement provided TMTV with most of the deficiency from that time forward, the defendants' interest obligations on the reduced balance give them a slight windfallalthough not at TMTV's expense.</p>\n<p>Our own case law treats an award of prejudgment interest in such cases as a matter for the informed discretion of the district court. <i>See </i><i>John G. Danielson, Inc. v. Winchester-Conant Props., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200368\"><a href=\"/opinion/200368/danielson-inc-v-winchester-conant/\"><span class=\"volume\">322</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.2003).<sup>[10]</sup> Given the range of circumstances and the mix of motives for such awards, this flexibility may make sense. Certainly on the present <span class=\"star-pagination\">*475</span> facts there was no abuse of discretion in making the award or in limiting it in the fashion adopted by the district judge.</p>\n<p>For <i>post-judgment</i> interest on federal judgments, a uniform federal rate applies by statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1961 (2006) (weekly average yield of one-year constant maturity treasury bills), but no default federal rate exists for prejudgment interest; here, the district judge applied the prevailing rate of 5 percent used in Puerto Rico courts for both pre- and post-judgment interest. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 32, App. III, R. 44.3 (2000). The federal post-judgment section 1961 interest rate would have been approximately 0.5 percent when judgment was entered in January 2009.</p>\n<p>The defendants claim that it was obligatory or at least more equitable to use the lower federal rate even though it is designed for post-judgment interest. The considerations are somewhat different where, absent a stay or bond, the successful plaintiff can effectively require prompt payment, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 64(b), and the present federal rate is depressed by current monetary policy designed to combat recession. The choice of the local rate, like the award itself, was within the sound discretion of the district judge. <i>E.g., </i><i>Colon Velez v. P.R. Marine Mgmt., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578606\"><a href=\"/opinion/578606/wilfredo-colon-velez-v-puerto-rico-marine-management-inc-wilfredo-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">957</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">933</span></a></span>, 941 (1st Cir.1992). Five percent is by historical standards hardly exorbitant.</p>\n<p>The last issue is attorneys' fees. Ordinarily, the prevailing party in a copyright case can be awarded fees \"[e]xcept as otherwise provided by\" the statute. 17 U.S.C. § 505. Here, such an award was barred by statute because the copyright for the scripts was not registered in a timely fashion. <i>Id.</i> § 412; <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Knitwaves, Inc. v. Lollytogs Ltd.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"709490\"><a href=\"/opinion/709490/knitwaves-inc-plaintiff-appellee-cross-appellant-v-lollytogs-ltd/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">996</span></a></span>, 1012 (2d Cir.1995) (vacating fee award). TMTV does not dispute that the statute barred such a recovery on TMTV's own claims against the defendants.</p>\n<p>Instead, TMTV argues that it was <i>also</i> the prevailing party as to Logroño's counterclaim, and so entitled to recover its attorneys' fees attributable to defending against this claim. The argumentunpromising in any eventis forfeit, <i>Dillon v. Select Portfolio Servicing,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"182688\"><a href=\"/opinion/182688/dillon-v-select-portfolio-servicing/\"><span class=\"volume\">630</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">75</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir.2011), having first been made in a motion for reconsideration of the district court's denial of TMTV's request for attorneys' fees.</p>\n<p>The district court's judgment is <i>affirmed.</i> Each side is to bear its own costs on these cross-appeals.</p>\n<p><i>It is so ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  The Hon.
