Douglas P. Woodlock, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n    Dianne Marlon on brief pro se.\n    Cheryl I. Smith on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           January 11, 2005\n\f            Per    Curiam.     Former   law    school    student,   plaintiff-\n\nappellant Dianne Marlon, appeals from the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of defendant-appellee Western New England\n\nCollege (\"College\"), in her action alleging failure to provide\n\nreasonable accommodation under the Americans with Disabilties Act\n\n(ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., the Rehabilitation Act of 1973,\n\n29 U.S.C. § 794, and the Massachusetts Equal Rights Act, Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 93, § 103.\n\n            Appellant seeks relief pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b), on\n\nthe   grounds     of   newly   discovered     evidence   and   errors   by   her\n\nattorney.     However, those claims have not been presented             to the\n\ndistrict court and cannot be raised for the first time in this\n\ncourt.      See Tiller v. Baghdady, 294 F.3d 277, 280 n.3 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).   \"New evidence is not to be proffered for the first time on\n\nappeal.\" In re Colonial Mortgage Bankers Corp., 186 F.3d 46, 51 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).       And, \"[w]e have repeatedly held that 'the acts and\n\nomissions of counsel are customarily visited upon the client in a\n\ncivil case.'\" Hoult v. Hoult, 57 F.3d 1, 5 n.3 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n            Marlon's remaining claims are that the district court\n\nerred in determining 1)that she was neither substantially limited\n\nby her impairments in the major life activities of learning and\n\nworking, nor so regarded by the defendant, and therefore not\n\ncovered under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, and 2) that\n\nMarlon had abandoned her claim that carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS)\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fsubstantially limited her major life activities of working and\n\nlearning.\n\n            As challenges to the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment, the claims are reviewed de novo. Gelabert-Ladenheim v.\n\nAmerican Airlines, 252 F.3d 54, 58 (1st Cir. 2001).       \"In assaying\n\nthe record, we are guided by the same tenets that guided the lower\n\ncourt. Thus we are duty bound to indulge all reasonable inferences\n\nin favor of the party opposing summary judgment.       This generous\n\noutlook notwithstanding, we must disregard improbable or overly\n\nattenuated    inferences,    unsupported   conclusions,     and     rank\n\nspeculation.\" Abbott v. Bragdon, 107 F.3d 934, 938 (1st Cir. 1997),\n\nvacated in part on other grounds, 524 U.S. 624 (1998).\n\n            Having carefully reviewed the record and briefs and\n\nconsidered the parties' arguments, we conclude for essentially the\n\nreasons articulated by the district court, that Marlon has failed\n\nto raise a material issue of fact that she was disabled under the\n\nrelevant statutes. With respect to her suggestion that the College\n\n\"regarded her\" as disabled under subsection (C) of § 12102(2) of\n\nthe ADA, the only evidence that Marlon provided was that the\n\nCollege provided her with certain accommodations for her condition.\n\nThat is insufficient evidence to create a triable issue on whether\n\nthe College regarded her as disabled.      See Thorton v. McClatchy\n\nNewspapers, Inc., 261 F.3d 789, 798 (9th Cir. 2001).              Marlon\n\npresented    no   evidence   that   the    College   maintained      any\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f\"misperceptions\" about her condition. See Mahon v. Crowell, 295\n\nF.3d 585, 592 (6th Cir. 2002) (upholding summary judgment on ground\n\nthat plaintiff      not   regarded       as    disabled      under   the    ADA   where\n\nplaintiff \"has not shown that [the employer] held any mistaken\n\nbelief about him\").\n\n          Marlon     argues       that    the    district       court      erroneously\n\nconcluded from the transcript of the summary judgment hearing\n\nbefore Judge Freedman that plaintiff had \"abandoned\" the argument\n\nthat her CTS limited a major life activity. See Appellant's Brief,\n\np. 23.   The transcribed exchange between plaintiff's counsel and\n\nJudge Freedman supports the district court's conclusion that the\n\nclaim was abandoned. See Sheehan v. Marr, 207 F.3d 35, 42 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).   Plaintiff's counsel stated that \"our case is not carpal\n\ntunnel syndrome\" and that \"[c]arpal tunnel syndrome may be a\n\ndisability if it substantially impairs.                We don't believe that was\n\nthe problem here.\"\n\n          Even if the claim had not been abandoned, however, Marlon\n\nhas not raised a material issue of fact that CTS substantially\n\nlimited her ability to learn or work. The evidence on which\n\nappellant relies does not support a finding that, with a college\n\ndegree and fifteen years of experience as a paralegal, Marlon would\n\nbe   disqualified     from    a    broad       range    of    jobs    or     otherwise\n\nsubstantially limited in her ability to work, when compared to the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\faverage person in the general population, because of her physical\n\nlimitations.\n\n           To fill the evidentiary gap, Marlon relies upon the\n\n\"newly discovered evidence.\"            Even if that evidence could be\n\nconsidered, however, the Certificate of Eligibility states that her\n\nCTS \"is not a barrier to employment at this time as she has already\n\npurchased various equipment to assist in removing any barriers\n\n[that CTS] may have presented.\" Appellant's Appendix, Exhibit A.\n\nThe \"ADA's coverage is restricted to only those whose impairments\n\nare not mitigated by corrective measures.\" Sutton v. United Air\n\nLines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471, 487 (1999).\n\n           Based upon our de novo review of the record, we also\n\nagree   with   the   district   court    that   Marlon   has   not   produced\n\nevidence that her CTS substantially limited her ability to learn.\n\n           The district court's judgment granting defendant's motion\n\nfor summary judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f",
