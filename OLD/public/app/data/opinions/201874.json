Petitioner Gabriel Cruz, III\n\nappeals the district court’s denial of his petition for a writ of\n\nhabeas corpus.    Cruz argues the state trial court improperly\n\ninstructed the jury and that defense counsel was ineffective for\n\nfailing to object to the erroneous jury instruction.     We AFFIRM.\n\n                            I.   BACKGROUND\n\n     In 1994, Cruz was part of a gang of four men who burglarized\n\ntwo apartments using a baseball bat and a firearm.       Tragically,\n\nseven-year-old Eve Rojas died of asphyxiation after her mouth and\n\nnose were bound with duct tape. Cruz was subsequently convicted of\n\nfirst-degree murder, three counts of burglary with assault on an\n\noccupant, armed assault in a dwelling, four counts of stealing by\n\nconfining or putting in fear, armed robbery, armed assault with\n\nintent to commit murder, and four counts of assault and battery by\n\nmeans of a dangerous weapon.     See Commonwealth v. Cruz, 714 N.E.2d\n\n813 (Mass. 1999).     Cruz’s first-degree murder conviction was\n\nobtained under a felony-murder rule theory, and he was sentenced to\n\nlife in prison without parole.      His convictions were affirmed on\n\nappeal except for his burglary convictions; they were vacated\n\nbecause they merged with his first-degree murder conviction as\n\nlesser-included offenses.    See id. at 823-24.   At trial, the court\n\ninstructed the jury that\n\n     [t]he final element of the crime of felony murder, here,\n     that the Commonwealth must prove, is that in the\n     circumstances of this case, the defendant committed or\n     attempted to commit the felony in question with a\n\n                                  -2-\n\f     conscious disregard for the risk to human life. The\n     crime, the felony of burglary with assault on an\n     occupant, is a crime that is defined in our law as\n     inherently dangerous to human life.\n\n     If you find that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a\n     reasonable doubt, that the defendant, Gabriel Cruz,\n     committed, as a joint venturer, the unlawful killing of\n     Eve Rojas, while in the course of committing the offense\n     of a burglary with an assault on an occupant, you would\n     be warranted in finding, without more, that he acted with\n     a conscious disregard for the risk to human life, because\n     that particular felony is inherently dangerous to human\n     life.\n\nCruz’s counsel did not object to this instruction.\n\n     In 2000, Cruz petitioned for habeas corpus relief pursuant to\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2254.   A United States magistrate judge issued a report\n\nand recommendation denying Cruz’s petition.    The magistrate judge\n\nlater issued a supplemental report and recommendation again denying\n\nCruz’s petition.     The district court adopted both reports and\n\nrecommendations, concluding that Massachusetts state law permitted\n\nthe trial court’s instruction, the United States Court of Appeals\n\nfor the First Circuit had rejected a similar argument, and Cruz’s\n\ncounsel was not ineffective because the instruction was consistent\n\nwith state-law “settled precedent.”\n\n     Nevertheless, the district court granted Cruz a certificate of\n\nappealability (“COA”) on two issues:    (1) whether the trial court\n\nviolated Cruz’s rights to trial by jury and due process of law by\n\ninstructing the jury that the felony of burglary with assault on an\n\noccupant is inherently dangerous to human life; and (2) whether\n\nCruz’s counsel was ineffective in failing to object to that jury\n\n                                 -3-\n\finstruction.    This court denied Cruz’s motion for an expanded COA.\n\nWe have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and 2253(c)(2).\n\n                               II.   DISCUSSION\n\n      Normally, this appeal would be governed by the Antiterrorism\n\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”).                However,\n\n“AEDPA’s strict standard of review only applies to a ‘claim that\n\nwas   adjudicated   on   the   merits   in   state   court   proceedings.’”\n\nFortini v. Murphy, 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir. 2001) (quoting 28\n\nU.S.C. § 2254(d)).        The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\n\n(“SJC”) decided Cruz’s jury instruction claim solely as a matter of\n\nstate law.     See Cruz, 714 N.E.2d at 818-19, 822 n.6.          Therefore,\n\nour review is de novo.          See Fortini, 257 F.3d at 47.        Cruz’s\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim is also reviewed de novo.\n\nSee id.\n\n1.    The Jury Instruction\n\n          Cruz argues that the trial court violated his rights to a\n\nfair trial and due process because the instruction established a\n\nconclusive presumption that relieved the state of proving an\n\nessential element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt – that he\n\nacted with a conscious disregard for the risk to human life.\n\n      The SJC analyzed the issue as follows:\n\n      3.    Inherently dangerous felony instruction.      The\n      defendant asserts that the judge improperly stated that\n      the felony of burglary with assault on an occupant is a\n      crime that is inherently dangerous to human life. The\n      defendant’s argument ignores settled precedent.     See\n      Commonwealth v. Selby, [686 N.E.2d 1316 (Mass. 1997)]\n\n                                      -4-\n\f     (armed assault in dwelling “by its very nature . . .\n     ‘inherently dangerous to human life,’ Commonwealth v.\n     Claudio, 418 Mass. 103, 108, 634 N.E.2d 902 [1994] [armed\n     burglary in dwelling with assault therein, under [Mass.\n     Gen. Laws Ann. ch.] 266, § 14, is inherently dangerous\n     felony and supported conviction for felony-murder”]).\n\nCruz, 714 N.E.2d at 818-19.             The Cruz court reiterated that\n\n“burglary with assault on an occupant is inherently dangerous to\n\nhuman life, and thus, the conscious disregard for human life\n\nrequisite for a finding of malice is presumed.”            Id. at 822 n.6.\n\n     Errors of state law are not a cognizable basis for federal\n\nhabeas   relief,   and   this   court   does   not    re-examine   the   SJC’s\n\ndetermination of a state-law question.         See Lewis v. Jeffers, 497\n\nU.S. 764, 780 (1990).       “Federal courts sitting in habeas must\n\naccept state court rulings on state law issues.             An inquiry into\n\nthe correctness of a ruling on state law issues ‘is no part of a\n\nfederal court’s habeas review of a state conviction.’”             Rodriguez\n\nv. Spencer, 412 F.3d      29, 37 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Estelle v.\n\nMcGuire, 502 U.S. 62, 67 (1991)).          The district court concluded\n\nthat Cruz’s claim “involv[ed] complicated matters of felony murder\n\ndoctrine under state common law, not federal constitutional law[.]”\n\n     Cruz’s habeas petition must be denied because Massachusetts\n\nlaw settles the issue.     See McMillan v. Pennsylvania, 477 U.S. 79,\n\n85 (1986) (states are left with the authority to prevent and deal\n\nwith crime).   “To make out a case of murder, the prosecutor need\n\nonly establish that the defendant committed a homicide while\n\nengaged in the commission of a felony[.]”            Commonwealth v. Gunter,\n\n                                    -5-\n\f692 N.E.2d 515, 525 (Mass. 1998) (citations omitted).                Thereafter,\n\n“[t]he effect of the felony-murder rule is to substitute the intent\n\nto    commit   the    underlying     felony    for   the   malice   aforethought\n\nrequired for murder.            Thus, the rule is one of ‘constructive\n\nmalice.’”      Id. (citations omitted).        In Commonwealth v. Selby, 686\n\nN.E.2d 1316, 1320 (Mass. 1997), the SJC reapplied the holding of\n\nCommonwealth v. Claudio, 634 N.E.2d 902 (Mass. 1994), that certain\n\nfelonies by their very nature are inherently dangerous, including\n\nburglary with assault on an occupant and armed assault in a\n\ndwelling, so as to justify felony-murder convictions.\n\n       Here, the SJC conclusively determined that the felony-murder\n\nrule was properly applied to Cruz because the felony of burglary\n\nwith assault on an occupant is inherently dangerous to human life.\n\nSee Commonwealth v. Scott, 701 N.E.2d 629, 632 (Mass. 1998) (“There\n\nis no need to show a ‘conscious disregard for human life because\n\nthe    risk    is    implicit   in   the    intent   required   for   [certain]\n\nfelon[ies]’” and “[it] is not the province of the jury to determine\n\nwhether a felony is inherently dangerous.”) (citation omitted)\n\n(emphasis added).        To reiterate, we cannot second-guess this state\n\nlaw decision on habeas review.             See Pulley v. Harris, 465 U.S. 37,\n\n41 (1983) (“A federal court may not issue the [habeas corpus] writ\n\non the basis of a perceived error of state law.”); Watkins v.\n\nCallahan, 724 F.2d 1038, 1043 (1st Cir. 1984) (rejecting arguments\n\nidentical to Cruz’s premised on identical rationale).\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f     This is not a case where the trial court directed a guilty\n\nverdict due to a conclusive presumption of guilt. Cf. Sandstrom v.\n\nMontana, 442 U.S. 510, 522 (1979).                  Unlike the burglary with\n\nassault on an occupant charge, the trial court did not instruct the\n\njury that “stealing by confining or putting in fear” is inherently\n\ndangerous.      This is correct.     See Scott, 701 N.E.2d at 632; Cruz,\n\n714 N.E.2d at 821-22 (“burglary with assault on an occupant” is\n\ninherently dangerous, whereas “stealing by confining or putting in\n\nfear” was not specifically defined as such).                   The trial court’s\n\ninstruction boiled down to an issue of Massachusetts state law and\n\nCruz’s attempt to recast the issue in a constitutional light is\n\nunavailing. The prosecution still had to prove all elements of the\n\ncharged crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.                    Although “conscious\n\ndisregard” remains an element of the felony, Massachusetts has\n\nresolved   to    substitute    it    for       malice   in   certain   inherently\n\ndangerous felonies.\n\n     Moreover,     this    claim    is   procedurally        defaulted.   Cruz’s\n\ncounsel    did    not     object    to    the     complained-of     instruction.\n\nTherefore, the SJC had to “determine whether the error created a\n\nsubstantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.” See Commonwealth v.\n\nAlphas, 712 N.E.2d 575, 580 (Mass. 1999) (citations omitted);\n\nCommonwealth v. Curtis, 632 N.E.2d 821, 825 (Mass. 1994) (“[A]n\n\nappellate court considers an issue not properly preserved for\n\nappellate review only on the ‘substantial risk of a miscarriage of\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fjustice’ standard . . . .”); Mass. R. Crim. P. 24(b) (“No party may\n\nassign as error the giving or the failure to give an instruction\n\nunless he objects thereto before the jury retires to consider its\n\nverdict, specifying the matter to which he objects and the grounds\n\nof his objection.”).1          Known as the “contemporaneous objection\n\nrule,” see Commonwealth v. Fluker, 385 N.E.2d 256, 261 (Mass. 1979)\n\n(failure   to   object    to    instruction     precludes    state   appellate\n\nreview), this court has held that\n\n     [i]n cases where defense counsel fails to make a timely\n     objection, the state does not waive the objection, and\n     the appellate decision rested on that ground, that is “a\n     classic example of a procedural default, and petitioner\n     can succeed in his habeas case only by showing cognizable\n     cause for, and cognizable prejudice from, his procedural\n     default or, alternatively, by demonstrating that the\n     federal court’s failure to address the claim on habeas\n     review will occasion a miscarriage of justice.”\n\nBrewer   v.   Marshall,    119    F.3d   993,    1001-02    (1st   Cir.   1997)\n\n(citations omitted).\n\n     Massachusetts       consistently      applies    the     contemporaneous\n\nobjection rule and has not waived it here.           See Gunter v. Maloney,\n\n291 F.3d 74, 79 (1st Cir. 2002) (“The SJC regularly enforces the\n\nrule that a claim not raised is waived.”).                  After considering\n\nCruz’s unpreserved argument and reviewing the instruction, the Cruz\n\ncourt ruled that his claim “ignore[d] settled precedent” and there\n\nwas no substantial risk of a miscarriage of justice.                 Cruz, 714\n\n\n1\n Cruz concedes that, under Massachusetts law, his failure to object\nto the instruction constituted a procedural default which deprived\nhim of the right to appellate review of this issue.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fN.E.2d at 818-19. This conclusion, accordingly, is an “independent\n\nand adequate state ground” barring review. See Brewer, 119 F.3d at\n\n999.    Since Cruz “defaulted his federal claims in state court\n\npursuant to an independent and adequate state procedural rule,\n\nfederal habeas review of [his] claims is barred unless [he] can\n\ndemonstrate cause for the default and actual prejudice as a result\n\nof the alleged violation of federal law,” or if he can show that\n\n“failure to consider the claims will result in a fundamental\n\nmiscarriage of justice.”       See Coleman v. Thompson, 501 U.S. 722,\n\n750 (1991).\n\n       “To excuse a procedural default, a petitioner’s cause must\n\nrelate to an objective factor, external to the defense, that\n\nthwarted (or at least substantially obstructed) the efforts of the\n\ndefendant or his counsel to obey the state’s procedural rule.”\n\nBurks v. Dubois, 55 F.3d 712, 716-17 (1st Cir. 1995).           The only\n\npotential cause available to Cruz is defense counsel’s failure to\n\nobject to the instruction.     See Gardner v. Ponte, 817 F.2d 183, 186\n\n(1st Cir. 1987).    As will be demonstrated, however, Cruz cannot\n\nestablish cause since defense counsel’s failure to object did not\n\nconstitute ineffective assistance of counsel.         See Burks, 55 F.3d\n\nat 716-17.    Nor can Cruz demonstrate that he was prejudiced:        the\n\njury was instructed in accordance with Massachusetts law.                 See\n\nSimpson v. Matesanz, 175 F.3d 200, 210 (1st Cir. 1999) (“[T]he\n\nSJC’s   decision   on   what   is   a   miscarriage   of   justice   is    a\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fdetermination made under state law[.]”).               There was no substantial\n\nrisk of a miscarriage of justice.\n\n        Accordingly, we reject Cruz’s claim that the trial court\n\nviolated his constitutional rights by instructing the jury that the\n\nfelony of burglary with assault on an occupant is a crime that is\n\ninherently dangerous to human life.\n\n2.     Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\n\n        Cruz also argues that he is entitled to habeas relief because\n\nhis counsel was constitutionally ineffective in failing to timely\n\nobject     to    the   jury    instruction.         Pursuant    to   Strickland   v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984), Cruz is required to “show that\n\ncounsel        performed      unreasonably    and    that      prejudice   resulted\n\ntherefrom.” United States v. Fornia-Castillo, 408 F.3d 52, 65 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (quoting United States v. Mena-Robles, 4 F.3d 1026, 1034\n\n(1st Cir. 1993)).\n\n        Cruz    insists    that   his   counsel’s     “ignorance     [and]   error”\n\nresulted in the failure to object, which was not a “tactical or\n\nstrategic” decision.            See Commonwealth v. Gelpi, 625 N.E.2d 543,\n\n544 (Mass. 1994) (failure to object to instruction constituted\n\nineffective assistance of counsel).2                Regardless of performance,\n\nCruz was not prejudiced. Massachusetts law is clear that the trial\n\ncourt’s jury instruction was consistent with settled precedent. In\n\nMassachusetts, “burglary with assault on an occupant is inherently\n\n\n2\n    Cruz again concedes procedural default.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fdangerous to human life, and thus, the conscious disregard for\n\nhuman life requisite for a finding of malice is presumed.”               See\n\nCruz, 714 N.E.2d at 822 n.6 (citing Claudio, 634 N.E.2d at 906-07).\n\nFailure to object to an accurate jury instruction does not qualify\n\nas ineffective assistance of counsel. See Commonwealth v. Jackmon,\n\n822 N.E.2d 754, 761-62 (Mass. App. Ct. 2005) (defense counsel’s\n\nfailure to object to felony-murder instruction was not ineffective\n\nwhere    instruction   was   correct).    Even   if   Cruz’s   counsel   had\n\nobjected, “there is [not] a reasonable probability that, but for\n\ncounsel’s unprofessional error[], the result of the proceeding\n\nwould have been different.”      Ouber v. Guarino, 293 F.3d 19, 25 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694).         This claim also\n\nfails.\n\n     We AFFIRM the district court’s denial of Cruz’s petition for\n\na writ of habeas corpus.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f",

We AFFIRM.\n\n                            I.   BACKGROUND\n\n     In 1994, Cruz was part of a gang of four men who burglarized\n\ntwo apartments using a baseball bat and a firearm.       Tragically,\n\nseven-year-old Eve Rojas died of asphyxiation after her mouth and\n\nnose were bound with duct tape. Cruz was subsequently convicted of\n\nfirst-degree murder, three counts of burglary with assault on an\n\noccupant, armed assault in a dwelling, four counts of stealing by\n\nconfining or putting in fear, armed robbery, armed assault with\n\nintent to commit murder, and four counts of assault and battery by\n\nmeans of a dangerous weapon.     See Commonwealth v. Cruz, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">714</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">813</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mass. 1999).     Cruz’s first-degree murder conviction was\n\nobtained under a felony-murder rule theory, and he was sentenced to\n\nlife in prison without parole.      His convictions were affirmed on\n\nappeal except for his burglary convictions; they were vacated\n\nbecause they merged with his first-degree murder conviction as\n\nlesser-included offenses.    See id. at 823-24.   At trial, the court\n\ninstructed the jury that\n\n     [t]he final element of the crime of felony murder, here,\n     that the Commonwealth must prove, is that in the\n     circumstances of this case, the defendant committed or\n     attempted to commit the felony in question with a\n\n                                  -2-\n\f     conscious disregard for the risk to human life. The\n     crime, the felony of burglary with assault on an\n     occupant, is a crime that is defined in our law as\n     inherently dangerous to human life.\n\n     If you find that the Commonwealth has proved beyond a\n     reasonable doubt, that the defendant, Gabriel Cruz,\n     committed, as a joint venturer, the unlawful killing of\n     Eve Rojas, while in the course of committing the offense\n     of a burglary with an assault on an occupant, you would\n     be warranted in finding, without more, that he acted with\n     a conscious disregard for the risk to human life, because\n     that particular felony is inherently dangerous to human\n     life.\n\nCruz’s counsel did not object to this instruction.\n\n     In 2000, Cruz petitioned for habeas corpus relief pursuant to\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2254.   A United States magistrate judge issued a report\n\nand recommendation denying Cruz’s petition.    The magistrate judge\n\nlater issued a supplemental report and recommendation again denying\n\nCruz’s petition.     The district court adopted both reports and\n\nrecommendations, concluding that Massachusetts state law permitted\n\nthe trial court’s instruction, the United States Court of Appeals\n\nfor the First Circuit had rejected a similar argument, and Cruz’s\n\ncounsel was not ineffective because the instruction was consistent\n\nwith state-law “settled precedent.”\n\n     Nevertheless, the district court granted Cruz a certificate of\n\nappealability (“COA”) on two issues:    (1) whether the trial court\n\nviolated Cruz’s rights to trial by jury and due process of law by\n\ninstructing the jury that the felony of burglary with assault on an\n\noccupant is inherently dangerous to human life; and (2) whether\n\nCruz’s counsel was ineffective in failing to object to that jury\n\n                                 -3-\n\finstruction.    This court denied Cruz’s motion for an expanded COA.\n\nWe have jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §§ 1291 and 2253(c)(2).\n\n                               II.   DISCUSSION\n\n      Normally, this appeal would be governed by the Antiterrorism\n\nand Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (“AEDPA”).                However,\n\n“AEDPA’s strict standard of review only applies to a ‘claim that\n\nwas   adjudicated   on   the   merits   in   state   court   proceedings.’”\n\nFortini v.

The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\n\n(“SJC”) decided Cruz’s jury instruction claim solely as a matter of\n\nstate law.     See Cruz, 714 N.E.2d at 818-19, 822 n.6.          Therefore,\n\nour review is de novo.          See Fortini, 257 F.3d at 47.        Cruz’s\n\nineffective assistance of counsel claim is also reviewed de novo.\n\nSee id.\n\n1.    The Jury Instruction\n\n          Cruz argues that the trial court violated his rights to a\n\nfair trial and due process because the instruction established a\n\nconclusive presumption that relieved the state of proving an\n\nessential element of the crime beyond a reasonable doubt – that he\n\nacted with a conscious disregard for the risk to human life.\n\n      The SJC analyzed the issue as follows:\n\n      3.    Inherently dangerous felony instruction.      The\n      defendant asserts that the judge improperly stated that\n      the felony of burglary with assault on an occupant is a\n      crime that is inherently dangerous to human life. The\n      defendant’s argument ignores settled precedent.     See\n      Commonwealth v.

Unlike the burglary with\n\nassault on an occupant charge, the trial court did not instruct the\n\njury that “stealing by confining or putting in fear” is inherently\n\ndangerous.      This is correct.     See Scott, 701 N.E.2d at 632; Cruz,\n\n714 N.E.2d at 821-22 (“burglary with assault on an occupant” is\n\ninherently dangerous, whereas “stealing by confining or putting in\n\nfear” was not specifically defined as such).                   The trial court’s\n\ninstruction boiled down to an issue of Massachusetts state law and\n\nCruz’s attempt to recast the issue in a constitutional light is\n\nunavailing. The prosecution still had to prove all elements of the\n\ncharged crimes beyond a reasonable doubt.                    Although “conscious\n\ndisregard” remains an element of the felony, Massachusetts has\n\nresolved   to    substitute    it    for       malice   in   certain   inherently\n\ndangerous felonies.\n\n     Moreover,     this    claim    is   procedurally        defaulted.
