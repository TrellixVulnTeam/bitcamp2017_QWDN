Plaintiffs-appellants James\n\nAlbright,    a    former   bodyguard     and    lover       of   Madonna,    and   his\n\ncorporate agent, Amrak Productions, Inc. (\"Amrak\"), appeal from the\n\ndismissal of their defamation, invasion of privacy, and other state\n\nclaims stemming from the publication of a tell-all book, Madonna.\n\nIn a nutshell, defendants-appellees author and publishers allegedly\n\nportrayed Albright as a homosexual by miscaptioning a picture of a\n\nhomosexual individual with Albright's name in a book and magazines.\n\nThe district court dismissed appellants' claims, finding that for\n\nthe   \"photograph     [to]   make[]     any    kind    of    statement      regarding\n\nAlbright's sexuality requires the Court to pile inference upon\n\ninnuendo, innuendo upon stereotype.\"             Albright v. Morton, 321 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 130, 132 (D. Mass. 2004).             The court also applied recent\n\nFederal and State Supreme Court decisions on homosexuality to hold\n\nthat a statement identifying an individual as homosexual is not\n\ndefamatory per se under Massachusetts law.                       Appellants argue\n\notherwise,       stating   that    continued     societal        and   governmental\n\nacceptance of various forms of discrimination against homosexuals\n\nshould lead to a presumption of injury.               We affirm the dismissals,\n\nalbeit on more limited grounds than the district court's holding.\n\n                                  I.   Background\n\n            Amrak employed Albright -- who has been involved in the\n\npersonal and professional security business for over ten years --\n\nas a professional bodyguard.           From January to July 1992, Albright\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fserved   as    Madonna's   bodyguard,     during   which   time   he   became\n\nromantically involved with the artist and remained so until 1994.\n\n              In December 2000, Albright entered into a contract with\n\nO'Mara Books to sell information about Madonna for an upcoming\n\nbiography.       The book, entitled Madonna, was written by author\n\nAndrew Morton and published by O'Mara Books in the United Kingdom\n\nand by St. Martin's Press in the United States in 2001.           Chapter 11\n\nof the book details Albright's relationship with Madonna.              Andrew\n\nMorton, Madonna 175-91 (St. Martin's Press) (2001).\n\n              The book also contains forty-eight pages of photographs,\n\nincluding one in which Madonna is accompanied by two men.              The man\n\nto the left is wearing black pants, a black and white shirt, a\n\nblack leather jacket, tinted sunglasses, a string necklace, and an\n\nearring.      The caption states:\n\n              Madonna attends ex-lover Prince's concert with\n              her secret lover and one-time bodyguard Jimmy\n              Albright (left).     Albright, who bears an\n              uncanny resemblance to Carlos León, the father\n              of Madonna's daughter, enjoyed a stormy three-\n              year relationship with the star. They planned\n              to marry, and had even chosen names for their\n              children.\n\nThis photograph allegedly defamed Albright because the man pictured\n\nwas, in fact, José Guitierez, an \"outspoken homosexual\" who \"often\n\ndressed as a woman,\" and engaged in what appellants describe as\n\n\"homosexual, sexually graphic, lewd, lascivious, offensive, and\n\npossibly illegal\" conduct.          Guitierez was employed as one of\n\nMadonna's dancers.\n\n                                    -3-\n\f           On November 12, 2001, People magazine, a publication of\n\nTime Inc., published the same photograph along with the erroneous\n\ncaption.    News    of   the   World,      a    publication     of    News       Group\n\nNewspapers, Ltd., published the same on March 17, 2002.\n\n           Appellants subsequently brought a diversity suit against\n\nMorton, Michael O'Mara Books, Michael O'Mara, St. Martin's Press,\n\nTime Inc., and News Group Newspapers, Ltd., in the District of\n\nMassachusetts.      Specifically,    appellants         sued   for    defamation,\n\ninvasion   of    privacy,   negligence,         negligent      and    intentional\n\ninfliction of emotional distress, along with violations of state\n\nstatutory prohibitions on unfair trade practices, Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 214, § 3A (2005) and ch. 93A, and unauthorized commercial use\n\nof a name or likeness, id. at ch. 214, § 3A.\n\n           On May 28, 2004, the district court granted appellees'\n\nmotion to dismiss on all counts.           First, the court held that no\n\nreasonable view of the photograph and text would suggest that\n\nAlbright   is   homosexual,    and   thus       the    publication        cannot    be\n\nconstrued as defamatory.          Alternatively, the court held that\n\nimputing homosexuality cannot be considered defamatory per se in\n\nMassachusetts,     particularly   given        the    rationales     in    the   U.S.\n\nSupreme Court's decision in Lawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558 (2003)\n\n(invalidating state statute criminalizing same-sex sexual conduct),\n\nas well as the Supreme Judicial Court's decision in Goodridge v.\n\nDep't of Pub. Health, 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003) (invalidating\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\flimitations to civil marriage for same-sex couples under state\n\nequal protection principles).             Given appellants' failure to state\n\na defamation claim, the court dismissed the derivative claims of\n\ncommercial      use,   false    light         invasion   of    privacy,   emotional\n\ndistress, negligence, and unfair trade practices.                       This appeal\n\nfollows.\n\n                                 II.      Analysis\n\nA.   Defamation\n\n           Appellants first argue that they have met the pleading\n\nrequirements necessary to survive a motion to dismiss a defamation\n\nclaim.   Despite our de novo review of the dismissals -- accepting\n\nall factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all\n\nreasonable inferences favorable to the appellant, see Barrington\n\nCove Ltd. P'ship v. Rhode Island Housing and Mortg. Fin. Corp., 246\n\nF.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2001) -- we disagree.\n\n           To    prevail   in       a    defamation      claim,   plaintiffs    must\n\nestablish that \"defendant[s] w[ere] at fault for the publication of\n\na false statement regarding the plaintiff, capable of damaging the\n\nplaintiff's     reputation     in       the   community,      which   either   caused\n\neconomic loss or is actionable without proof of economic loss.\"\n\nWhite v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., 809 N.E.2d 1034,\n\n1036 (Mass. 2004) (footnote omitted).               A court may dismiss written\n\ndefamation claims, i.e., libel claims, if the communication is\n\n\"incapable of a defamatory meaning.\"                 Brauer v. Globe Newspaper\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fCo., 217 N.E.2d 736, 738 (Mass. 1966) (quoting Muchnick v. Post\n\nPubl'g Co., 125 N.E.2d 137, 138 (Mass. 1955).                 This threshold\n\nquestion, \"whether a communication is reasonably susceptible of a\n\ndefamatory meaning, is a question of law for the court.\"            Phelan v.\n\nMay Dept. Stores Co., 819 N.E.2d 550, 554 (Mass. 2004).\n\n             A communication is susceptible to defamatory meaning if\n\nit \"would tend to hold the plaintiff up to scorn, hatred, ridicule\n\nor contempt, in the minds of any considerable and respectable\n\nsegment in the community.\"         Id. at 553 (quoting Stone v. Essex\n\nCounty Newspapers, Inc., 330 N.E.2d 161, 165 (Mass. 1975)).                  The\n\ncommunication     \"must    be    interpreted     reasonably,\"      leading    a\n\n\"reasonable reader\" to conclude that it conveyed a defamatory\n\nmeaning.     Foley v. Lowell Sun Publ'g Co., 533 N.E.2d 196, 197\n\n(Mass. 1989) (internal quotation marks omitted).             Context matters\n\nin assessing such claims: \"The court [must] examine the statement\n\nin   its   totality   in   the   context   in   which   it   was   uttered    or\n\npublished.    The court must consider all the words used, not merely\n\na particular phrase or sentence.\" Id. (quoting Myers v. Boston\n\nMagazine Co., 403 N.E.2d 376, 379 (Mass. 1980)). The Massachusetts\n\nSupreme Judicial Court, for example, has required that allegedly\n\ndefamatory photographs or headlines be interpreted in light of the\n\nentire context of the publication -- i.e., the entire text of the\n\narticle -- to survive dismissal. Compare Mabardi v. Boston Herald-\n\nTraveler Corp., 198 N.E.2d 304, 306 (Mass. 1964) (holding that\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fplaintiff stated a claim for defamation where implications from the\n\njuxtaposition of plaintiff's photo with the article \"was not\n\ndiscouraged by any clarifying textual reference to the plaintiff\"),\n\nwith Foley, 533 N.E.2d at 197 (affirming dismissal of defamation\n\nclaim where text of article accompanying the contested headline\n\nmade clear that plaintiff had been arrested, not convicted, for\n\nassault).    See generally Lambert v. Providence Journal Co., 508\n\nF.2d 656, 658 (1st Cir. 1975) (\"reading the [challenged] articles\n\nin their entirety\" to determine whether they were reasonably\n\ncapable of any defamatory meaning).\n\n            The miscaptioned photograph in the instant case is not\n\nreasonably   susceptible   of   a   defamatory   meaning.   Nothing   in\n\nGuitierez's appearance, particularly given the accompanying caption\n\nstressing    Albright's   heterosexuality   (e.g.,   Madonna's   \"secret\n\nlover\"), gives any indication that Albright is homosexual. To draw\n\nsuch an inference, the reader -- who would have to view homosexuals\n\nwith \"scorn, hatred, ridicule or contempt,\" Phelan, 819 N.E.2d at\n\n553 -- must follow Madonna and her cohort closely enough to\n\nrecognize Guitierez as a gay man, but not closely enough to know\n\nGuitierez's name or what Albright looks like. Few, if any, readers\n\nwould fall into this \"considerable and respectable segment in the\n\ncommunity.\" Id.\n\n            The context of the text accompanying the photograph\n\nfurther deflates any argument that the photo conveys a defamatory\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fmeaning. When we \"consider all the words used\" in the accompanying\n\ntext, Foley, 553 N.E.2d at 197 -- including phrases such as\n\nAlbright's \"long-time girlfriend,\" his \"hot and heavy\" affair with\n\nMadonna, their sexual encounters, and Albright's \"fling\" with a\n\n\"girl at a club\" -- we find that no reasonable reader could\n\nconclude that Albright is homosexual. This conclusion is supported\n\nby the caption, which states that Albright was Madonna's \"secret\n\nlover,\" that they \"enjoyed a stormy three-year relationship,\" and\n\nthat they planned to marry and \"had even chosen names for their\n\nchildren.\" Similarly, the caption for the People Weekly photograph\n\nstates that Albright felt \"overwhelming love\" for Madonna, with the\n\naccompanying article detailing their relationship.\n\n             Given   appellants'      failure   to    satisfy    the   threshold\n\nquestion of defamatory meaning, we affirm the court's dismissal of\n\nthe defamation claim.       Moreover, given the court's correct finding\n\nthat   the   photograph     and   its    caption     make   no   imputation     of\n\nhomosexuality, we need not decide whether such an imputation\n\nconstitutes defamation per se in Massachusetts.\n\nB.   Derivative Claims\n\n             We   have   considered     appellants'    derivative      claims   --\n\ncommercial use, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress, and Chapter 93A -- and find them all without merit.                   We\n\nlikewise reject appellants' urging that the false light invasion of\n\nprivacy claim should be recognized in Massachusetts, particularly\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fgiven the state court's repeated refusal to do so.   See, e.g., ELM\n\nMed. Lab., Inc. v. RKO Gen., Inc., 532 N.E.2d 675, 691 (Mass.\n\n1989); Jones v. Taibbi, 512 N.E.2d 260, 270 n.12 (Mass. 1987); Fox\n\nTree v. Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc., 501 N.E.2d 519, 522\n\n(Mass. 1986).   The district court's judgments are affirmed.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

(\"Amrak\"), appeal from the dismissal of their defamation, invasion of privacy, and other state claims stemming from the publication of a tell-all book, <i>Madonna.</i> In a nutshell, defendants-appellees author and publishers allegedly portrayed Albright as a homosexual by miscaptioning a picture of a homosexual individual with Albright's name in a book and magazines. The district court dismissed appellants' claims, finding that for the \"photograph [to] make[ ] any kind of statement regarding Albright's sexuality requires the Court to pile inference upon innuendo, innuendo upon stereotype.\" <i>Albright v. Morton,</i> 321 F.Supp.2d 130, 132 (D.Mass.2004). The court also applied recent Federal and State Supreme Court decisions on homosexuality to hold that a statement identifying an individual as homosexual is not defamatory <i>per se</i> under Massachusetts law. Appellants argue otherwise, stating that continued societal and governmental acceptance of various forms of discrimination against homosexuals should lead to a presumption of injury.

The book, entitled <i>Madonna,</i> was written by author Andrew Morton and published by O'Mara Books in the United Kingdom and by St. Martin's Press in the United States in 2001.

The district court dismissed appellants' claims, finding that for the \"photograph [to] make[ ] any kind of statement regarding Albright's sexuality requires the Court to pile inference upon innuendo, innuendo upon stereotype.\" <i>Albright v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></a></span>, 132 (D.Mass.2004). The court also applied recent Federal and State Supreme Court decisions on homosexuality to hold that a statement identifying an individual as homosexual is not defamatory <i>per se</i> under Massachusetts law. Appellants argue otherwise, stating that continued societal and governmental acceptance of various forms of discrimination against homosexuals should lead to a presumption of injury. We affirm the dismissals, albeit on more limited grounds than the district court's holding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Amrak employed Albright&#8212;who has been involved in the personal and professional security business for over ten years&#8212;as a professional bodyguard. From January to July 1992, Albright served as Madonna's bodyguard, during which time he became romantically involved with the artist and remained so until 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 2000, Albright entered into a contract with O'Mara Books to sell information about Madonna for an upcoming biography. The book, entitled <i>Madonna,</i> was written by author Andrew Morton and published by O'Mara Books in the United Kingdom and by St. Martin's Press in the United States in 2001. Chapter 11 of the book details Albright's relationship with Madonna. Andrew Morton, <i>Madonna</i> 175-91 (St. Martin's Press) (2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The book also contains forty-eight pages of photographs, including one in which Madonna is accompanied by two men. The man to the left is wearing black pants, a black and white shirt, a black leather jacket, tinted sunglasses, a string necklace, and an earring. The caption states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Madonna attends ex-lover Prince's concert with her secret lover and one-time bodyguard Jimmy Albright (<i>left</i>). Albright, who bears an uncanny resemblance to Carlos Le&#243;n, the father of Madonna's daughter, enjoyed a stormy three-year relationship with the star. They planned to marry, and had even chosen names for their children.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This photograph allegedly defamed Albright because the man pictured was, in fact, Jos&#233; Guitierez, an \"outspoken homosexual\" who \"often dressed as a woman,\" and engaged in what appellants describe as \"homosexual, sexually graphic, lewd, lascivious, offensive, and possibly illegal\" conduct. Guitierez was employed as one of Madonna's dancers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 12, 2001, <i>People</i> magazine, a publication of Time Inc., published the same photograph along with the erroneous caption. <i>News of the World,</i> a publication of News Group Newspapers, Ltd., published the same on March 17, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants subsequently brought a diversity suit against Morton, Michael O'Mara Books, Michael O'Mara, St. Martin's Press, Time Inc., and News Group Newspapers, Ltd., in the District of Massachusetts. Specifically, appellants sued for defamation, invasion of privacy, negligence, negligent and intentional infliction of emotional distress, along with violations of state statutory prohibitions on unfair trade practices, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 214, &#167; 3A (2005) and ch. 93A, and unauthorized commercial use of a name or likeness, <i>id.</i> at ch. 214, &#167; 3A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 28, 2004, the district court granted appellees' motion to dismiss on all counts. First, the court held that no reasonable view of the photograph and text would suggest that Albright is homosexual, and thus the publication cannot be construed as defamatory. Alternatively, the court held that imputing homosexuality cannot be considered defamatory <i>per se</i> in Massachusetts, particularly given the rationales in the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in <i>Lawrence v.
