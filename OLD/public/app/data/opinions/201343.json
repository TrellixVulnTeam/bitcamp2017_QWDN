Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Raymond Rivera Esteves and Juan A. Hernandez Rivera on brief\nfor appellant.\n     H. S. Garcia, Unites States Attorney, Camille Velez-Rive,\nAssistant United States Attorney, and Robert M. Peckrill, Assistant\nRegional Counsel, Social Security Administration, on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           November 19, 2004\n\f               Per Curiam.     Appellant Pascual Roman-Roman alleged\n\ndisability due to severe mental and physical impairments.                The\n\nevidence submitted by appellant showed that he had worked at a\n\nnewspaper for nearly 30 years.          Toward the end of this period a\n\nback injury and back surgery, followed by re-injury and other\n\nevents, precipitated debilitating pain and serious depression.\n\nIn   1998,     after    physical   therapy    and   psychiatric   treatment,\n\nappellant sought disability benefits alleging inability to work\n\nfrom March 1998 onward.\n\n               The ALJ found that appellant's impairments barred his\n\nreturn    to    his    past   work,   but    that   despite   some   physical\n\nlimitations appellant retained the residual physical capacity for\n\nunskilled light work.         These findings are not at issue on this\n\nappeal.      The ALJ further found, however, that appellant's non-\n\nexertional impairments--that is, his mental difficulties--did not\n\nsignificantly erode the occupational base available to appellant\n\nfor such work, and that the occupational \"grid\" therefore applied\n\nto (and precluded) his disability claim.            Appellant seeks review\n\nof this determination.\n\n               Our review is limited to assuring that the ALJ deployed\n\nthe correct legal standards and found facts upon the proper\n\nquantum of evidence. 42 U.S.C. § 405(g) (2000); Manso-Pizarro v.\n\nSec'y of Health & Human Servs., 76 F.3d 15, 16 (1st Cir. 1996)\n\n(per curiam).         We will uphold the decision only if it is\n\n                                      -2-\n\fsupported by substantial evidence, evidence rationally adequate\n\non the record as a whole to justify the conclusion.             Rodriguez\n\nPagan v. Sec'y of Health & Human Servs., 819 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n1987) (per curiam), cert. denied, 484 U.S. 1012 (1988). Although\n\nweighting       evidence    and   resolving   conflicts   are   the   ALJ's\n\nprerogative, he may not ignore evidence, misapply the law or\n\njudge matters entrusted to experts.           Nguyen v. Chater, 172 F.3d\n\n31, 35 (1st Cir. 1999) (per curiam).\n\n              Under the case law, it is appropriate for the Secretary\n\nto rely upon the grid to bar disability status where a claimant\n\nis within the exertional limitations and the admitted mental\n\nimpairments have only a slight effect on the availability of\n\nwork.       Heggarty v. Sullivan, 947 F.2d 990, 996 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n\"If     a     non-strength     impairment,    even   though     considered\n\nsignificant, has the effect only of reducing that occupational\n\nbase marginally, the Grid . . . can be relied on exclusively . .\n\n. .\"    Ortiz v. Sec'y of Health & Human Servs., 890 F.2d 520, 524\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).           The ALJ's determination thus presents two\n\nquestions for review: whether the ALJ acted properly in crediting\n\nsome experts' testimony over others', and if so whether the\n\ncredited portions of the medical evidence were sufficient to\n\npermit the ALJ to rely solely on the grid.\n\n               With regard to the first question, the ALJ's relative\n\nweighing of the medical testimony is adequately supported by the\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fevidence.        The ALJ was presented with conflicting opinions\n\nregarding Roman's mental capacity: these ranged from a prognosis\n\nof    complete    dysfunction       by   Roman's   psychiatrist     to   one   of\n\nmoderate functioning by a non-examining government psychologist.\n\nThe    record    also    included        two   other   government    attending\n\npsychologists' opinions, which were less sanguine than the non-\n\nattending physician but conveyed some degree of adequate mental\n\nfunctioning.      It was within the ALJ's discretion to credit the\n\nmore positive reports of Roman's mental condition; we cannot find\n\nhis    conclusions      in   this    regard    unsupported   by     substantial\n\nevidence.    See Rodriguez Pagan, 819 F.2d at 2-3.\n\n            The second question is more difficult. The question of\n\nthe impact of Roman's condition on the availability of work is\n\none on which the Secretary bears the burden of proof, Vazquez v.\n\nSec'y of Health & Human Servs., 683 F.2d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 1982),\n\nand under Ortiz the Secretary may use the grid as a shortcut to\n\ndenial of disability only if the impairments do no more than\n\nmarginally erode the range of work available to the applicant in\n\nan established work category.              890 F.2d at 524.       Although the\n\nissue is a close one, we think that even the more positive\n\nevaluations of Roman's mental condition are insufficient to show\n\nwhat Ortiz requires.\n\n            The most favorable report of any of the attending\n\npsychiatrists still found moderate depression sufficient to merit\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fa \"guarded\" prognosis; it also found that appellant's judgment\n\nwas only fair, that his short-term memory remained poor, that he\n\ncould not concentrate enough to recite days backward or subtract\n\nby   threes,    and     that   his   daily     activities   were     minimal.\n\nSimilarly,     the    non-examining    state    psychologist    noted    that\n\nappellant was afflicted with an affective disorder including\n\ndepression,          irritability,      hallucinations         and      other\n\ncharacteristics that moderately limited his functioning in a\n\nnumber   of     relevant       categories,     including    understanding,\n\nconcentration and social interaction.\n\n             In the absence of a better explanation as to how these\n\nmedical findings illustrate that a nearly full set of unskilled\n\nlight work is available to Roman, we believe that a translation\n\nfrom medical evaluations to job prospects was more appropriately\n\nreserved for a vocational expert.              On this record, there are\n\nsignificant mental constraints outlined by even the most positive\n\npsychological prognoses and we cannot find any clear basis for\n\nconcluding that the impairments have no significant effect on the\n\nwork still available to appellant.           This certainly does not show\n\nthat appellant is disabled but, unless this gap is closed, it\n\ndoes preclude reliance upon the grid.\n\n             On remand, the ALJ may employ a vocational expert to\n\nfill the gap, obtain further medical evidence that may link\n\nRoman's mental capacity more directly to the work he is capable\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fof doing, or both.   This is admittedly a close case but the\n\nevidence of impairment is somewhat stronger here than in Ortiz,\n\nwhich affirmed a denial based upon the grid but only barely.   We\n\ndo not suggest that a vocational expert is required in all such\n\ncases.\n\n          Vacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                              -6-\n\f",
