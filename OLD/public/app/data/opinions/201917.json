This appeal arises from an\n\nattempt    by    plaintiff-appellant       Pharmaceutical      Care     Management\n\nAssociation (\"PCMA\") to challenge the provisions of Maine's Unfair\n\nPrescription Drug Practices Act (\"UPDPA\"), Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\n\n22, § 2699 (2005). PCMA brought suit against defendant-appellee G.\n\nSteven Rowe, Attorney General of the State of Maine, seeking to\n\nobtain an order enjoining enforcement of the UPDPA.                    The parties\n\nissued cross-motions for summary judgment, and the district court\n\ndenied    PCMA's    motion    and   granted    the    motion   of    the    Attorney\n\nGeneral.    PCMA    now   appeals     this     decision.       For   the     reasons\n\nhereinafter stated, we affirm the decision of the district court.\n\n                             I.   Factual Background\n\n            PCMA is a national trade association of pharmacy benefit\n\nmanagers (PBMs).      PBMs are major players in the delivery of health\n\ncare in the United States.          They act as middlemen in the lucrative\n\nbusiness    of     providing      prescription       drugs.     They       serve    as\n\nintermediaries between pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmacies\n\non the one hand (as the district court noted, the \"supply\" side of\n\nthe trade) and health benefit providers (e.g., insurers, self-\n\ninsured entities, health maintenance organizations, and public and\n\nprivate health plans) on the other (the \"demand\" side).                            The\n\nservices that PBMs extend are designed to facilitate the provision\n\nof   prescription     drug    benefits    to   the    people   who    utilize      the\n\nservices of the health benefit providers.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f            For example, PBMs often provide health benefit providers\n\nwith   access      to   an    established      network    of     pharmacies,   where\n\ncustomers of the health benefit providers can obtain drugs at\n\ncertain set prices.           PBMs negotiate volume discounts and rebates\n\nwith drug manufacturers by pooling substantial numbers of health\n\nbenefit providers.           This pooling gives the PBMs tremendous market\n\npower to demand concessions from the manufacturers.                      PBMs also\n\nprovide     drug    utilization        review     services       and   \"therapeutic\n\ninterchange programs\" (in other words, substituting a drug for the\n\none actually prescribed by a doctor).\n\n            In this role as intermediary, however, PBMs have the\n\nopportunity to engage in activities that may benefit the drug\n\nmanufacturers and PBMs financially to the detriment of the health\n\nbenefit   providers.            For   example,    in     cases    of   \"therapeutic\n\ninterchange,\" a PBM may substitute a more expensive brand name drug\n\nfor an equally effective and cheaper generic drug.                  This is done so\n\nthat the PBM can collect a fee from the manufacturer for helping to\n\nincrease the manufacturer's market share within a certain drug\n\ncategory.       Similarly, a PBM might receive a discount from a\n\nmanufacturer on a particular drug but not pass any of it on to the\n\nhealth benefit provider, keeping the difference for itself.                     The\n\nhealth benefit provider, however, often has no idea that a PBM may\n\nnot be working in its interest.                This lack of awareness is the\n\nresult of the fact that there is little transparency in a PBM's\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fdealings with manufacturers and pharmacies.   As the district court\n\nnoted, \"[w]hether and how a PBM actually saves an individual\n\nbenefits provider customer money with respect to the purchase of a\n\nparticular prescription drug is largely a mystery to the benefits\n\nprovider.\" Pharm. Care Mgmt. Ass'n v. Rowe, No. 05-1606, 2005 U.S.\n\nDist. LEXIS 2339, at *6 (D. Me. Feb. 2, 2005).\n\n          With the aim of placing Maine health benefit providers in\n\na better position to determine whether PBMs are acting against\n\ntheir interests, and correspondingly, to help control prescription\n\ndrug costs and increase access to prescription drugs, the Maine\n\nLegislature enacted the UPDPA in the spring of 2003.     The UPDPA\n\nimposes a number of requirements on those PBMs that choose to enter\n\ninto contracts in Maine with \"covered entities\" -- meaning health\n\nbenefit providers and including, in part, insurance companies, the\n\nstate Medicaid program, and employer health plans.   Such PBMs are\n\nrequired to act as fiduciaries for their clients and adhere to\n\ncertain specific duties. For example, they must disclose conflicts\n\nof interest, disgorge profits from self-dealing, and disclose to\n\nthe covered entities certain of their financial arrangements with\n\nthird parties.    Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, §§ 2699(2)(A-G)\n\n(2005).   The disclosures made by the PBMs to the covered entities\n\nare protected by confidentiality.     None of the disclosures are\n\navailable to the public.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f               PCMA, on behalf of its member PBMs, challenges the UPDPA\n\non five separate grounds.            First, it claims that the Maine law was\n\npreempted by either the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of\n\n1974    (\"ERISA\")       or   the    Federal      Employee       Health   Benefits      Act\n\n(\"FEHBA\").          PCMA's second argument is that the UPDPA violates the\n\nTakings Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it conditions doing\n\nbusiness       in    Maine   upon    the   forced    disclosure          or   taking   of\n\nproprietary information. Third, PCMA states that the provisions of\n\nthe    UPDPA    violate      due    process   because       they    provide     no   pre-\n\ndeprivation hearing. Fourth, the association claims that the UPDPA\n\ndisclosure provisions violate the First Amendment by compelling\n\ncommercial          speech   in    the   context     of     a    voluntary     business\n\nrelationship. PCMA's final argument is that the UPDPA violates the\n\nCommerce Clause, either through its \"extraterritorial reach\" or by\n\nexcessively burdening interstate commerce.1\n\n               In the proceedings below, the parties issued cross-\n\nmotions for summary judgment. The magistrate judge responsible for\n\nthe case recommended to the district court that summary judgment be\n\n\n1\n     PCMA also alleges a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983 (2000),\nclaiming that the UPDPA subjects PCMA's member PBMs to the\ndeprivation of \"rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the\nConstitution.\"   The district court entered summary judgment in\nfavor of the appellee on this claim. It reasoned that since the\nUPDPA did not run afoul of any of the federal rights raised by\nPCMA, summary judgment was proper on PCMA's § 1983 claim. PCMA\nraises this same § 1983 claim on appeal but provides no additional\ndiscussion on the matter. Because we also find that the UPDPA is\nnot violative of any federal rights, we think the district court\nwas correct in disposing of this claim on summary judgment.\n\n                                           -6-\n\fentered in favor of the Attorney General on all claims.          The\n\ndistrict court agreed with this recommendation and upheld the UPDPA\n\nagainst all of PCMA's challenges.        Upon careful review, we now\n\naffirm.\n\n                            II.   Discussion\n\nA.   Standard of review\n\n           We review a district court's ruling on cross-motions for\n\nsummary judgment de novo.    Calero-Cerezo v. Dep't of Justice, 355\n\nF.3d 6, 19 (2004).\n\nB.   Preemption claims2\n\n           ERISA is \"a comprehensive statute designed to promote the\n\ninterests of employees and their beneficiaries in employee benefit\n\nplans.\"    Shaw v. Delta Airlines, 463 U.S. 85, 90 (1983). The\n\nstatute includes a broadly-worded preemption provision, 29 U.S.C.\n\n\n2\n   In addition to its claim that the UPDPA is preempted by ERISA,\nPCMA argues that the UPDPA is also preempted by FEHBA.       FEHBA\nauthorizes the Office of Personnel Management to negotiate\ncontracts with private carriers to provide health benefits for\nfederal employees, retirees, and their dependents.     The statute\nincludes an express preemption provision, 5 U.S.C. § 8902(m)(1)\n(2000), that is nearly identical to ERISA's preemption provision.\nTherefore, we look to ERISA precedent in determining the scope of\nthe preemption provision under FEHBA. See Botsford v. Blue Cross\n& Blue Shield of Mont., Inc., 314 F.3d 390, 393-94 (9th Cir. 2002)\n(noting that the FEBHA preemption provision closely resembles\nERISA's preemption provision and that \"precedent interpreting the\nERISA provision thus provides authority for cases involving the\nFEHBA provision\"). Because both parties here, as they did before\nthe district court, agree that \"whether the FEHBA preempts the\nUPDPA depends on essentially the same analysis as the question of\nwhether ERISA preempts the UPDPA,\" we confine our discussion here\nto examining the scope of the ERISA preemption provision. Pharm.\nCare Mgmt. Ass'n, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2339, at *29.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f§ 1144(a) (2000), that Congress included \"to afford employers the\n\nadvantages of a uniform set of administrative procedures governed\n\nby a single set of regulations.\"               Fort Halifax Packing Co. v.\n\nCoyne, 482 U.S. 1, 11 (1987).           PCMA here claims that the UPDPA is\n\npreempted by ERISA.\n\n                                        1.\n\n            In examining PCMA's preemption claim, a threshold issue\n\nwe must confront is whether the PBMs act as ERISA fiduciaries.3\n\nThis   is   an    issue   with   high   stakes,     for    classification      as   a\n\nfiduciary    or    a   nonfiduciary     renders     a     defendant   liable    for\n\ndifferent types of damages.          For example, under sections 409 and\n\n502(a)(2) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. §§ 1109(a), 1132(a)(2), an ERISA\n\nfiduciary    is     personally     liable     for       monetary   damages,     for\n\nrestitution, and for \"such other equitable or remedial relief as\n\nthe court may deem appropriate.\"              29 U.S.C. § 1109(a).          A non-\n\nfiduciary, however, is not subject to monetary damages in a suit\n\nbrought under ERISA.       See Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs., 508 U.S. 248,\n\n262 (1993) (noting how \"[p]rofessional service providers such as\n\n\n\n\n3\n   Although the district court noted that \"PCMA's member PBMs are\nnot ERISA fiduciaries,\" Pharm. Care Mgmt. Ass'n, 2005 U.S. Dist.\nLEXIS 2339, at *16, and the parties state that they agree to this\nfact, we feel it necessary to explore this issue in some depth\nhere, both because our subsequent analysis relies on its outcome\nand because the briefs of the parties belie their mutual contention\nthat they are in agreement as to the status of PBMs under ERISA.\n\n                                        -8-\n\factuaries become liable for damages when they cross the line from\n\nadviser to fiduciary\").4\n\n          Under     ERISA,    a    fiduciary   is   one   who   exercises\n\ndiscretionary     authority   or    control    in   the   management     and\n\nadministration of an ERISA plan.          29 U.S.C. § 1002(21)(A).      See\n\nalso Mertens, 508 U.S. at 251, 262.         The Attorney General argues\n\nthat since PBMs do not exercise discretionary authority or control\n\nin the management and administration of ERISA plans, they are not\n\nfiduciaries under the definition provided for under ERISA.             PCMA,\n\nin contrast, claims that the UPDPA makes PBMs fiduciaries in\n\nperforming administration activities for ERISA plans.           The UPDPA,\n\nafter all, targets PBMs that contract with \"covered entities\" --\n\ninsurance companies, the state Medicaid program, and employer\n\nhealth plans -- some of which may be ERISA plans.               The UPDPA\n\nrequires PBMs to be fiduciaries of the covered entities with which\n\nthey contract. Therefore, when a PBM contracts with a covered\n\nentity that happens to be an ERISA plan, the PBM is a fiduciary of\n\nthat ERISA plan.\n\n          Although the UPDPA does impose certain fiduciary duties\n\non the PBMs, these are duties imposed under state law.            The key\n\n\n\n4\n  In Mertens, the Supreme Court expressly reserved the question as\nto whether ERISA provides for a cause of action against\nnonfiduciaries who assist in a fiduciary's breach of duty. The\nCourt, however, did resolve the question as to whether a\nnonfiduciary in such a suit would be subject to monetary damages.\nSee Mertens, 508 U.S. at 253-54.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fissue here, however, is whether the PBMs are fiduciaries under the\n\ndefinition of a fiduciary provided in ERISA.                     Our review of the\n\nrequirements imposed on the PBMs under the UPDPA lead us to believe\n\nthat the PBMs do not exercise \"discretionary authority or control\n\nin the management and administration of the plan.\"                         29 U.S.C.\n\n§   1002(21)(A).       For   example,    the       UPDPA      provisions    requiring\n\ndisclosure    of     conflicts   of   interest          and    payments    from    drug\n\nmanufacturers are administrative provisions involving no discretion\n\non the part of the PBMs.         Such duties are purely ministerial and\n\nsimply not sufficient for us to find that the PBMs are acting as\n\nfiduciaries under ERISA.\n\n                                        2.\n\n            With that threshold matter disposed of, we are now able\n\nto confront the main issue at hand: Is the UPDPA preempted by\n\nERISA? PCMA claims that ERISA does preempt the UPDPA because ERISA\n\npreempts all state laws that \"relate to any ERISA covered employee\n\nbenefit plan,\" 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a), regardless of whether an entity\n\nis acting as a fiduciary or not.              The state, in contrast, argues\n\nthat the UPDPA is not preempted by ERISA because ERISA only\n\npreempts     state    laws   relating        to    acts       performed     by    ERISA\n\nfiduciaries.       Since the PBMs regulated by the UPDPA are not\n\nfiduciaries    under    ERISA,   there       can   be    no    preemption    in    this\n\ninstance.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f            To answer the question of what exactly ERISA preempts, we\n\nfirst turn to the statute itself.             ERISA's preemption provision\n\nstates explicitly that ERISA \"shall supersede any and all State\n\nlaws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee\n\nbenefit plan.\"      29 U.S.C. § 1144(a) (2000).           Looking only at the\n\nface of the statute, then, it appears that PCMA is correct.                 With\n\nits broad and expansive language, the ERISA preemption provision\n\nseems to say that all state laws that in any way \"relate to\" any\n\nERISA-covered employee benefit plan are preempted.\n\n            The Supreme Court, however, has stated that the language\n\nof the ERISA preemption provision is not as broad as it seems.               The\n\nCourt has emphasized that the expansive language of the provision\n\nis still subject to \"the starting presumption that Congress does\n\nnot intend to supplant state law\" and has warned \"that, unless\n\ncongressional intent to preempt clearly appears, ERISA will not be\n\ndeemed to supplant state law in areas traditionally regulated by\n\nthe states.\"     New York State Conf. of Blue Cross & Blue Shield\n\nPlans v. Travelers Ins. Co., 514 U.S. 645, 654, 661 (1995);\n\nCarpenters Local Union No. 26 v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 215 F.3d\n\n136, 139-40 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            Realizing, then, that the exact scope of the ERISA\n\npreemption provision is imprecise and that the provision cannot be\n\nread   literally,    the   Court   has   developed    a    two-part   test    to\n\ndetermine   exactly    what   state    laws   ERISA   preempts.       The   test\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\festablished by the Court begins with reference to the preemption\n\nprovision itself. As already stated, ERISA expressly preempts \"any\n\nand all State laws insofar as they . . . relate to any employee\n\nbenefit plan.\" 29 U.S.C. § 1144(a) (2000).                    \"[T]he incidence of\n\nERISA preemption turns on the parameters of the phrase 'relate\n\nto.'\"   Carpenters Local Union No. 26, 215 F.3d at 139.                  The Court\n\nhas stated that a particular state law \"relates to\" an employee\n\nbenefit plan \"if it [1] has a connection with or [2] a reference to\n\nsuch a plan.\" California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v.\n\nDillingham       Constr.,    N.A.,    Inc.,    519     U.S.    316,    324   (1997);\n\nCarpenters Local Union No. 26, 215 F.3d at 140.                  We use this test\n\nto determine whether the UPDPA is preempted by ERISA.\n\n            a)    The \"connection with\" prong\n\n            The    Supreme    Court    has    stated    that    when    determining\n\nwhether a state law has a \"connection with\" ERISA plans, a court\n\nmust avoid an \"uncritical literalism\" and look instead to \"the\n\nobjectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the\n\nstate law that Congress understood would survive, as well as to the\n\nnature of the effect of the state law on ERISA plans.\"                  Egelhoff v.\n\nEgelhoff, 532 U.S. 141, 147 (2001) (citing Travelers, 514 U.S. at\n\n656 and Dillingham, 519 U.S. at 325) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).    According to the Court, \"[t]he basic thrust of the pre-\n\nemption clause . . . was to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in\n\norder to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fbenefit plans.\"          Travelers, 514 U.S. at 657.           State laws that\n\nimpede    this    goal    of   national   uniformity    will    be   preempted.\n\nTherefore, we must determine here whether the UPDPA, in placing\n\nfiduciary duties and administrative burdens on PBMs operating in\n\nMaine, thereby precludes the ability of plan administrators to\n\nadminister their plans in a uniform fashion.\n\n            In several different cases, the Supreme Court has found\n\nthis goal of \"national uniformity\" to be compromised (and therefore\n\nthe state law was preempted). For example, in Alessi v. Raybestos-\n\nManhattan, Inc., 451 U.S. 504, 526 (1981), the Court invalidated a\n\nNew Jersey law that prohibited offsetting worker compensation\n\npayments against pension benefits.           \"Since such a practice [was]\n\npermissible under federal law and the law of other States, the\n\neffect of the [state] statute was to force the employer either to\n\nstructure all its benefit payments in accordance with New Jersey\n\nlaw, or to adopt different payment formulae for employees inside\n\nand outside the State.\"         Fort Halifax, 482 U.S. at 10 (discussing\n\nthe holding in Alessi).         Similarly, in Egelhoff, the Supreme Court\n\nfound    that    \"[u]niformity    [was]   impossible\"    with     regard   to   a\n\nWashington statute that provided that the designation of a spouse\n\nas the beneficiary of a nonprobate asset was revoked automatically\n\nupon divorce.      Egelhoff, 532 U.S. at 148.     The Court held that the\n\nstatute was preempted by ERISA because \"[p]lan administrators\n\n[could not] make payments simply by identifying the beneficiary\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fspecified   by   the   plan   documents.   Instead,   they   [had   to]\n\nfamiliarize themselves with [specific] state statutes so that they\n\n[could] determine whether the named beneficiary's status [had] been\n\n'revoked' by operation of law.\"     Id. at 148-49.5\n\n            In contrast to the state laws at issue in Alessi and\n\nEgelhoff, the goal of national uniformity poses no problems in the\n\ninstant case.    In no way does the UPDPA circumscribe the ability of\n\nplan administrators to structure or administer their ERISA plans.\n\nAs the district court stated, \"[t]he fact that the UPDPA requires\n\nPBMs to engage in certain 'required practices' in Maine, such as\n\ndivulging the terms of contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers\n\n\n5\n   Alessi and Egelhoff are not the only cases in which the Supreme\nCourt has encountered a state law that \"created the prospect that\nan employer's administrative scheme would be subject to conflicting\nrequirements.\"   Fort Halifax, 482 U.S. at 10.     For example, in\nShaw, the Court found that two New York laws were preempted by\nERISA. One of those laws, New York's Human Rights Law, prohibited\n\"employers from structuring their employee benefit plans in a way\nthat discriminated on the basis of pregnancy.\" Shaw, 463 U.S. at\n97. The second, New York's Disability Benefits Law, required\n\"employers to pay employees specific benefits.\" Id. The Court\nheld that these laws were preempted by ERISA because they \"could\nhave been honored only by varying the subjects of a plan's benefits\nwhenever New York law might have applied, or by requiring every\nplan to provide all beneficiaries with a benefit demanded by New\nYork law. Travelers, 514 U.S. at 657 (discussing the holding in\nShaw). Similarly, in FMC Corp. v. Holliday, 498 U.S. 52 (1990),\nthe Court discussed a Pennsylvania law that prohibited plans from\n\"requiring reimbursement [from the beneficiary] in the event of\nrecovery from a third party.\" Id. at 60. The law was likewise\npreempted by ERISA because the law \"require[d] plan providers to\ncalculate benefit levels in Pennsylvania based on expected\nliability conditions that differ from those in States that have not\nenacted    similar    antisubrogation     legislation,    [thereby]\nfrustrat[ing] plan administrators' continuing obligation to\ncalculate uniform benefit levels nationwide.\" Id.\n\n                                  -14-\n\fand labelers does not restrict the freedom of employee benefit\n\nplans to administer or structure their plans in Maine precisely as\n\nthey would elsewhere.\"      Pharm. Care Mgmt. Ass'n, 2005 U.S. Dist.\n\nLEXIS 2339, at *23-24.     This is simply not a case where \"uniformity\n\nis impossible . . . [because] plans are subject to different legal\n\nobligations in different States.\"         Egelhoff, 532 U.S. at 148.\n\n          In attempting to demonstrate that the UPDPA would require\n\nemployee benefit plans to implement unique measures in Maine, PCMA\n\npoints to the way in which the UPDPA attempts \"to dictate the terms\n\nof contracts between ERISA plans and PBMs, including by redefining\n\nthe duties and liabilities of PBMs to such plans, their sponsors\n\nand participants.\"    PCMA also points out how the UPDPA        \"attempts\n\nto regulate plans' relationship[s] with PBMs when PBMs perform\n\nadministrative functions for such plans.\" Although the ERISA plans\n\ncan re-evaluate their working relationships with the PBMs if they\n\nwish in light of the UPDPA, nothing in the UPDPA compels them to do\n\nso.   This is not an instance, such as that confronted by the\n\nSupreme Court in Egelhoff, where the plan administrators were bound\n\nto a particular choice of rules -- rules mandated by the state for\n\ndetermining beneficiary status.      The plan administrators here have\n\na free hand to structure the plans as they wish in Maine.         We find,\n\ntherefore,   that    the   UPDPA   does    not   have   an   impermissible\n\n\"connection with\" ERISA plans.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f           b)    The \"reference to\" prong\n\n           A state law is preempted by ERISA by virtue of an\n\nimpermissible \"reference to\" an ERISA plan \"[w]here a State's law\n\nacts immediately and exclusively upon ERISA plans . . . or where\n\nthe existence of ERISA plans is essential to the law's operation.\"\n\nDillingham, 519 U.S. at 325.\n\n           In Carpenters Local Union No. 26, when explaining the\n\nscope of this test in light of the Supreme Court's decisions in\n\nTravelers and Dillingham, we discussed two prior precedents of our\n\nown: McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech., 950 F.2d 13 (1st Cir. 1991) and\n\nWilliams v. Ashland Eng'g Co., 45 F.3d 588 (1st Cir. 1995).              McCoy\n\ndealt with a Massachusetts mechanics' lien statute that, \"by its\n\nterms, inured to the advantage of 'the trustee or trustees of any\n\nfund or funds, established pursuant to section 302 of the Taft\n\nHartley [Act].'\" Carpenters Local Union No. 26, 215 F.3d at 142\n\n(noting also that any plan that grants benefits under section 302\n\nis by definition an ERISA plan). Williams, in contrast, dealt with\n\na bond statute covering public works projects.               Id. at 143.    We\n\nnoted that this bond statute differed from the mechanics' lien\n\nstatute   in    McCoy   in   that   the   \"bond   statute   makes   no   direct\n\nreference to section 302\" (and hence, no direct reference to ERISA)\n\nand in that the language of the bond statute was not at all \"ERISA-\n\nspecific.\"      Id.   The relevant language in Williams stood \"at the\n\nend of a long list of items,\" most of which had \"nothing whatever\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fto do with ERISA.\"      Id.   In Carpenters Local Union No. 26, we noted\n\nthat the specific reference to an ERISA plan in McCoy was what gave\n\nrise to ERISA preemption.        Id. at 142.\n\n          We think the UPDPA is similar to the state law at issue\n\nin Williams.    The existence of ERISA plans is not at all essential\n\nto the operation of the UPDPA.         The UPDPA applies regardless of\n\nwhether PBMs are serving ERISA plans. The law applies with respect\n\nto a broad spectrum of health care institutions and health benefit\n\nproviders, including but not limited to ERISA plans.                \"Covered\n\nentities\" under the UPDPA includes health plans, labor union plans,\n\nassociation    plans,   insurance    companies,   HMOs,   medical   service\n\norganizations, and the state Medicaid program. Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 22, § 2699(1)(A).\n\n          PCMA, in support of its proposition that ERISA plans are\n\nessential to the UPDPA's operation, cites to Dist. of Columbia v.\n\nGreater Washington Bd. of Trade, 506 U.S. 125 (1992).               In that\n\ncase, the law at issue required an employer who provided health\n\ninsurance coverage to its employees to provide equivalent coverage\n\nto injured employees eligible for workers' compensation benefits.\n\nThe coverage for injured employees was \"measured by reference to\n\n'the existing health insurance coverage' provided by the employer,\"\n\nwhich the Court found to be a \"reference to\" an ERISA plan and\n\ntherefore preempted under ERISA.        Id. at 130.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\f           As we pointed out in Carpenters Local Union No. 26,\n\nhowever,   the   law   at   issue    in   Greater   Washington   contained    a\n\nspecific reference to an ERISA plan.            See Carpenters Local Union\n\nNo. 26, 215 F.3d at 144 n.7.              Such a law would be completely\n\ninoperable if the reference to the ERISA plan were omitted.                  It\n\nrelied on the reference for its operation. The UPDPA, in contrast,\n\nhas no such deficiency.             Although the UPDPA does operate to\n\nregulate PBMs that contract with employee health plans -- some of\n\nwhich may happen to be ERISA plans -- it also operates upon the\n\nstate   Medicaid   program    and    on   insurance    companies.    If   the\n\nreference to employee health plans was deleted from the text of the\n\nUPDPA, the statute would still be operable.6             As we have stated\n\npreviously, \"[a] state law that applies to a wide variety of\n\nsituations, including an appreciable number that have no specific\n\nlinkage to ERISA plans, constitutes a law of general application\n\nfor purposes of 29 U.S.C. § 1144.\"           Carpenters Local Union No. 26,\n\n215 F.3d at 144-45 (adding that \"state laws of general application\n\nare safe from ERISA preemption\").\n\n\n\n\n6\n   We also note that in Dillingham, the Supreme Court faced a\nsimilar situation with apprenticeship programs. Since the Court\nfound that the \"approved apprenticeship programs [in that case]\nneed not necessarily be ERISA plans,\" it refused to find that the\nCalifornia law at issue there \"ma[de] reference to\" ERISA plans.\nDillingham, 519 U.S. at 325.\n\n                                      -18-\n\f              c)   Alternative enforcement mechanism\n\n              PCMA,      therefore,    is    unable      to   show    that    the   UPDPA\n\n\"relates to\" an employee benefit plan under either the \"connection\n\nwith\" or \"reference to\" prongs of the test prescribed by the\n\nSupreme Court.        PCMA, however, offers an alternative argument. It\n\nstates      that   the    UPDPA's     remedial      scheme     (i.e.,    the     UPDPA's\n\nenforcement provision in Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 2699(4)\n\n(2005)) conflicts with the \"exclusive\" remedial scheme set forth by\n\nCongress in ERISA (in 29 U.S.C. § 1132 (2000)) and is therefore\n\npreempted.\n\n              The civil enforcement provision of ERISA, 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1132 (2000), provides a mechanism by which plan participants,\n\nbeneficiaries, fiduciaries, and the Secretary of Labor can sue to\n\nenforce rights expressly guaranteed by ERISA.                        29 U.S.C. § 1132\n\n(2000) (ERISA § 502(a)). Accordingly, \"ERISA preemption proscribes\n\nthe type of alternative enforcement mechanism that purposes to\n\nprovide a remedy for the violation of a right expressly guaranteed\n\nand exclusively enforced by the ERISA statute.\"                      Carpenters Local\n\nUnion No. 26, 215 F.3d at 141.              In Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon,\n\n498 U.S. 133 (1990), the Supreme Court specifically recognized that\n\na   state    law   can     be   preempted      as   an    alternative        enforcement\n\nmechanism to ERISA § 502(a).\n\n              ERISA, however, does not preempt state laws that \"touch\n\nupon enforcement but have no real bearing on the intricate web of\n\n\n                                            -19-\n\frelationships among the principal players in the ERISA scenario\n\n(e.g.,   the   plan,   the   administrators,     the   fiduciaries,   the\n\nbeneficiaries, and the employer).\"        Carpenters Union Local No. 26,\n\n215 F.3d at 141.       Here, the UPDPA targets the PBMs, which, as\n\nstated above, are not ERISA fiduciaries. As such, they are outside\n\nof the \"intricate web of relationships among the principal players\n\nin the ERISA scenario.\"      Id.   The district court correctly noted\n\nthat \"[a]lthough ERISA prescribes the duties that are owed by ERISA\n\nentities to one another, and prescribes remedies for their breach,\n\nit is not designed to regulate or afford remedies against entities\n\nthat provide services to plans.\"          Pharm. Care Mgmt. Ass'n, 2005\n\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 2339, at *28-29.          Therefore, we hold that the\n\nUPDPA does not provide an alternative enforcement mechanism to\n\nERISA's civil enforcement scheme and is not preempted.\n\n          PCMA, however, points to the Supreme Court's recent\n\ndecision in Aetna Health, Inc. v. Dávila, 124 S. Ct. 2488 (2004).\n\nPCMA argues that in Dávila, the Court held that state causes of\n\naction purporting to supplement ERISA §502(a) are preempted \"even\n\nif the elements of the state cause of action [do] not precisely\n\nduplicate the elements of an ERISA claim.\"        Id. at 2499-2500.   In\n\nthat case, however, the plaintiffs were plan participants and\n\nbeneficiaries who brought suit \"only to rectify a wrongful denial\n\nof benefits promised under ERISA-regulated plans\" and who did not\n\nattempt to remedy any violation of a legal duty independent of\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\fERISA.   Id. at 2492-93, 2498.         In other words, all the parties in\n\nthat case were part of the \"intricate web of relationships among\n\nthe principal players in the ERISA scenario.\"                   Carpenters Union\n\nLocal No. 26, 215 F.3d at 141.         That was the reason that the state\n\nremedy in that case was preempted. Therefore, PCMA's use of Dávila\n\nis misplaced.\n\nC.   Takings claim\n\n           Under the UPDPA, PBMs are required to disclose to their\n\ncustomers in Maine information concerning the discounts and other\n\ncontract   terms     that   they   are      able   to    negotiate    with    drug\n\nmanufacturers      and   pharmacies.        According     to    the   PCMA,   this\n\ninformation is confidential and proprietary and is to be considered\n\na \"trade secret.\"        Because the UPDPA requires PBMs to disclose\n\nthese trade secrets as a condition of doing business in Maine, PCMA\n\ncontends that the UPDPA effects a regulatory taking, and this\n\nrequires   \"just    compensation\"      under    the     Fifth   Amendment.      \"A\n\nregulatory taking transpires when some significant restriction is\n\nplaced upon an owner's use of his property for which 'justice and\n\nfairness' require that compensation be given.\"              Philip Morris Inc.\n\nv. Reilly, 312 F.3d 24, 33 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting Goldblatt v.\n\nHempstead, 369 U.S. 590, 594 (1962)).\n\n                                       1.\n\n           Before we reach the merits of such a claim, however, we\n\nfirst must assess whether PCMA has standing to bring a takings\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fclaim here.     The district court held that PCMA did not have\n\nstanding.    Standing decisions are reviewed by this court de novo.\n\nDonahue v. City of Boston, 304 F.3d 110, 116 (1st Cir. 2002); Nyer\n\nv. Winterthur Int'l, 290 F.3d 456, 459 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            \"[A]n association has standing to bring suit on behalf of\n\nits members when: (a) its members would otherwise have standing to\n\nsue in their own right; (b) the interests it seeks to protect are\n\ngermane to the organization's purpose; and (c) neither the claim\n\nasserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of\n\nindividual members in the lawsuit.\" Hunt v. Washington State Apple\n\nAdver. Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977).    The third factor of this\n\ntest is prudential. United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local\n\n751 v. Brown Group, Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 557 (1996).    PCMA here has\n\nthe burden to prove it has standing.     Harvey v. Veneman, 396 F.3d\n\n28, 34 (1st Cir. 2005); Donahue, 304 F.3d at 116.\n\n            The main point of conflict in this case regards the\n\nthird, prudential, prong of the Hunt test: \"Neither the claim\n\nasserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of\n\nindividual members in the lawsuit.\"     The district court concluded\n\nthat the third factor for associational standing had not been met\n\nbecause at least one PBM would have to participate in the suit to\n\nprove that property was being taken.     Also, the court noted that\n\nbecause some PBMs might not be affected if they did not possess\n\ntrade secrets (because they had already contracted away access to\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fthis   information),    the   claim   would   require    member-by-member\n\nscrutiny.    We disagree.\n\n            PCMA is indeed required to introduce evidence \"pertaining\n\nto how, inter alia, one or more of its members develops, and\n\nmaintains the secrecy of, its information and how one or more of\n\nits members would be injured by disclosure.\"            Pharm. Care Mgmt.\n\nAss'n, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2339, at *39.         However, in Playboy\n\nEnters., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n of Puerto Rico, 906 F.2d 25 (1st\n\nCir. 1990), we noted that \"just because a claim may require proof\n\nspecific to individual members of an association does not mean the\n\nmembers are required to participate as parties in the lawsuit.\"\n\nPlayboy Enters., 906 F.2d at 35. (emphasis in original).         We think\n\nthat to be true here.    Even though a takings inquiry is intensely\n\nfact specific and PCMA will be required to introduce proof of\n\nspecific PBM practices and effects of the UPDPA on specific PBMs,\n\nwe see no reason that PCMA's member PBMs would be required to\n\nparticipate as parties in this litigation.\n\n            In Playboy Enters., we discussed the Supreme Court's\n\nholding in Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490 (1975).         Playboy Enters.,\n\n906 F.2d at 35.    In Warth, the Court held that an association had\n\nno standing to sue on behalf of its members when seeking monetary\n\nrelief to compensate for its members' injuries. Warth, 422 U.S. at\n\n515-16.   In Playboy Enters., we noted that \"the crucial reason [in\n\nWarth] for requiring the members' participation as parties must\n\n\n                                  -23-\n\fhave been so that the members [rather than the association] could\n\nrecover their own damages, should they prevail.\"    Playboy Enters.,\n\n906 F.2d at 35 (emphasis in original).       The association in that\n\ncase was not entitled to be compensated for the various injuries\n\nsuffered by its members.    \"The members' participation as parties\n\nwas necessary so that judgment could be entered in their favor.\"\n\nId. at 35-36 (emphasis in original). In the instant case, however,\n\nthere is no similar claim for monetary damages. PCMA requests only\n\nequitable relief.   Such a remedy would, if granted, \"inure to the\n\nbenefit of those members of the association actually injured.\"\n\nWarth, 422 U.S. at 515.   There is, in other words, no need here for\n\nthe member PBMs to participate as parties.    As such, PCMA does have\n\nassociational standing to assert its claim.\n\n                                 2.\n\n          With the disposal of that threshold jurisdictional issue,\n\nwe can now address the merits of PCMA's takings claim.    Here, PCMA\n\nbrings a facial challenge to the UPDPA, asserting that the UPDPA\n\nviolates the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it\n\nconditions doing business in Maine upon the forced disclosure or\n\ntaking of proprietary information.\n\n          In the takings context, a facial challenge is usually\n\nripe \"the moment the challenged regulation or ordinance is passed.\"\n\nSuitum v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency, 520 U.S. 725, 736 n.10\n\n(1997). To succeed on a facial challenge to a statute, however, is\n\n\n                                -24-\n\fvery difficult.     As we have noted before, a plaintiff wishing to\n\nbring a facial challenge \"face[s] an uphill battle.\"        Reilly, 312\n\nF.3d at 52 (Lipez, J., dissenting) (quoting Keystone Bituminous\n\nCoal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. 470, 495 (1987)).        \"A facial\n\nchallenge to a legislative Act is . . . the most difficult\n\nchallenge    to   mount   successfully,   since   the   challenger   must\n\nestablish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act\n\nwould be valid.\"    Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am. v. Concannon, 249\n\nF.3d 66, 77 (1st Cir. 2001) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nHere, this would mean that PCMA has the burden to prove that every\n\ndisclosure under the UPDPA, if uncompensated, would result in an\n\nunconstitutional taking.\n\n            PCMA, however, has not met this burden. This is a result\n\nof the differing circumstances of PCMA's member PBMs.         There are\n\ncertain PBMs that have already disclosed extensive information to\n\ntheir clients, pursuant to contract or in the context of annual\n\naudits.   The state writes, for example, about how\n\n            . . . Medco [a PBM] allows United Healthcare\n            [a client] virtually unfettered access to\n            Medco's contracts, contract terms, rebates,\n            records and information; virtually complete\n            audit rights; and even the ability to\n            participate in negotiations with the drug\n            manufacturers. Appellee Br. 31-32.\n\nAll of this information is now also required to be disclosed under\n\nthe UPDPA.    See, e.g., Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 22, § 2699(2)(D)\n\n(2005) (requiring disclosure of all financial and utilization\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\finformation requested by a covered entity relating to the provision\n\nof services to that covered entity).\n\n           None of this information, however, can in any way be\n\nconsidered a trade secret.        Under Maine law, a trade secret is\n\n\"information . . .   that . . . [d]erives independent economic value\n\n. . . from not being generally known to and not being readily\n\nascertainable by proper means by other persons who can obtain\n\neconomic value from its disclosure or use and . . . is the subject\n\nof efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain\n\nits secrecy.\"   Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 10, § 1542(4) (2005).              See\n\nalso   Ruckelshaus   v.   Monsanto    Co.,   467    U.S.   986,   1002   (1984)\n\n(\"Because of the intangible nature of a trade secret, the extent of\n\nthe property right therein is defined by the extent to which the\n\nowner of the secret protects his interest from disclosure to\n\nothers.\").\n\n           The information disclosed as a result of these client\n\ncontracts, however, is readily available.            The record is replete\n\nwith evidence demonstrating that the PBMs that made these contracts\n\nhave taken no special steps to protect their information.                  For\n\nexample,   Timothy   Wentworth,      the    group   President     of   National\n\nAccounts for Medco, stated that he was not aware of any written\n\nsecurity policy prohibiting the removal of client contracts at\n\nMedco. Other PBMs keep these client contracts in unlocked cabinets\n\n\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\f\"in public areas such as hallways.\" Therefore, such information --\n\nat least under Maine law -- cannot be considered a \"trade secret.\"\n\n            Given that there are no trade secrets involved with these\n\nclient contracts, there is no \"property\" subject to the Takings\n\nClause.     See    Monsanto,    467   U.S.   at    1002    (\"If   an    individual\n\ndiscloses his trade secret to others who are under no obligation to\n\nprotect    the   confidentiality      of   the    information,     or    otherwise\n\npublicly     discloses    the      secret,        his     property      right   is\n\nextinguished.\").      Hence, many disclosures required from the PBMs\n\nunder the UPDPA would not be considered unconstitutional takings.\n\nTherefore, PCMA cannot show that every disclosure under the UPDPA\n\nwill result in an unconstitutional taking, for there are clear and\n\nobvious circumstances when disclosures under the UPDPA are not\n\nunconstitutional takings.        We therefore hold that PCMA's facial\n\ntakings claim fails on the merits.\n\nD.   Due Process claim\n\n            As the district court recognized, this claim \"tags along\"\n\nwith PCMA's takings claim.       In Zinermon v. Burch, 494 U.S. 113, 132\n\n(1990), the Supreme Court held that due process requires that \"[i]n\n\nsituations where the State feasibly can provide a predeprivation\n\nhearing before taking property, it generally must do so regardless\n\nof the adequacy of a postdeprivation tort remedy to compensate for\n\nthe taking.\"      As we have already discussed, however, PCMA has not\n\nbeen able to show that the UPDPA effects a taking.                Since there is\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\fno taking and no deprivation, it follows that no predeprivation\n\nhearing is required.   The district court was therefore correct to\n\ngrant summary judgment in favor of the state on this claim.\n\nE.   First Amendment claim\n\n           The district court also found that the provisions of the\n\nUPDPA do not violate the First Amendment.     PCMA claims that the\n\nUPDPA violates the First Amendment because it compels PBMs to\n\nengage in speech -- in the form of mandated disclosures -- as a\n\ncondition of doing business in Maine.     In a number of different\n\ncases, the Supreme Court has recognized that compulsion to speak\n\nmay be as violative of the First Amendment as prohibitions on\n\nspeech.    See, e.g., Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of\n\nthe Supreme Court of Ohio, 471 U.S. 626 (1985); Wooley v. Maynard,\n\n430 U.S. 705 (1977); Miami Herald Publ'g Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S.\n\n241 (1974).   We agree with PCMA that a compelled disclosure, such\n\nas the one here, does indeed implicate the First Amendment.\n\n           In assessing whether the disclosures mandated by the\n\nUPDPA are violative of the provisions of the First Amendment, the\n\ninitial question we must confront is the nature of the speech.   The\n\ndegree of protection afforded by the First Amendment depends on\n\nwhether the speech here is commercial speech or noncommercial\n\nspeech.7   \"'[C]ommercial speech' is entitled to the protection of\n\n\n7\n   The district court simply assumed that the speech at issue here\nis \"commercial speech.\" We, however, think that the classification\nof speech in this case is not at all clear and deserves a full\n\n                                -28-\n\fthe First Amendment, albeit to protection somewhat less extensive\n\nthan that afforded 'noncommercial speech.'\"          Zauderer, 471 U.S. at\n\n637;    see also Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass'n., 436 U.S. 447, 456\n\n(1978) (\"[W]e . . . have afforded commercial speech a limited\n\nmeasure of protection, commensurate with its subordinate position\n\nin the scale of First Amendment values, while allowing modes of\n\nregulation      that   might    be   impermissible    in   the   realm     of\n\nnoncommercial expression.\"); Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp.,\n\n463    U.S.   60,   64-65   (1983)   (\"[t]he   Constitution   accords    less\n\nprotection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally\n\nsafeguarded forms of expression.\").\n\n              If the speech here is of a commercial nature, there is a\n\nreduced burden on the state to justify the UPDPA.             See Zauderer,\n\n471 U.S. at 650-651; Riley v. Nat'l Fed'n of the Blind of North\n\nCarolina, Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 796 n.9 (1988) (\"Purely commercial\n\nspeech is more susceptible to compelled disclosure requirements.\").\n\nIf, however, the speech is of a noncommercial nature, the compelled\n\ndisclosure will be subject to \"exacting First Amendment scrutiny.\"\n\nRiley, 487 U.S. at 798.        In such a case, the state, to justify its\n\nlaw, would have to advance a compelling state interest and also\n\nshow that the means chosen to accomplish that interest are narrowly\n\ntailored. See id. at 795 (noting that a statute that mandates\n\nspeech \"that a speaker would not otherwise make necessarily alters\n\n\nanalysis.\n\n                                     -29-\n\fthe content of the speech\" and that such a statute is therefore\n\nconsidered a content-based regulation of speech); Madsen v. Women's\n\nHealth Ctr., 512 U.S. 753, 790-91 (1994) (noting that content-based\n\nregulations receive strict scrutiny).\n\n          We have stated that commercial speech is defined as\n\n\"expression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker\n\nand its audience.\"    El Día, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Dept. of Consumer\n\nAffairs, 413 F.3d 110, 115 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing Central Hudson\n\nGas & Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of New York, 447 U.S. 557,\n\n561 (1980)).   Although it is a close question, we think that the\n\nspeech mandated by the UPDPA meets this definition.          Many of the\n\nUPDPA's provisions are overtly geared at the economic interests of\n\nthe PBMs and the covered entities.        See, e.g., Me. Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 22, § 2699(2)(F) (requiring PBMs to disclose and disgorge any\n\npayment or benefit based on volume of sales or classes or brands of\n\nprescription drugs).       Even those provisions of the UPDPA that are\n\non their face less related to \"economic interests\" -- e.g., id.\n\n§ 2699(2)(C) (requiring PBMs to disclose conflicts of interest) --\n\nare aimed at eliminating certain PBM practices that unnecessarily\n\nincrease the cost of prescription medications.\n\n          We discuss this case, therefore, on the basis that\n\ncommercial speech is at issue. In Zauderer, the Supreme Court held\n\nthat \"[b]ecause the extension of First Amendment protection to\n\ncommercial   speech   is    justified   principally   by   the   value   to\n\n\n                                   -30-\n\fconsumers of the information such speech provides,\" a party who was\n\nfaced with a disclosure requirement had only a minimal interest in\n\nwithholding the information requested of him by law. Zauderer, 471\n\nU.S. at 651.       The Court also held that the party's rights are\n\nadequately     protected   \"as   long   as    disclosure   requirements     are\n\nreasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception\n\nof consumers.\"     Id.8\n\n              Applying these principles here, we find that the UPDPA\n\ndisclosure provisions do not run afoul of the First Amendment.\n\nPCMA's member PBMs only have a minimal interest in withholding the\n\ninformation the UPDPA requires from them, especially given Maine's\n\ninterest in ensuring that its citizens receive the best and most\n\ncost-effective health care possible.             The information disclosed\n\nunder   the    UPDPA   will   help   the     \"covered   entities\"    that   are\n\nresponsible for paying for medications in Maine ensure that they\n\nand their customers are not adversely affected by the abuses and\n\nself-dealing of certain PBMs.           Furthermore, we think it obvious\n\nthat the UPDPA's disclosure requirements are \"reasonably related\"\n\nto Maine's interest in preventing deception of consumers and\n\nincreasing public access to prescription drugs.                Id.     As the\n\ndistrict court noted, these disclosure requirements are\n\n\n8\n   In its reply brief, PCMA states that the holding in Zauderer is\n\"limited to potentially deceptive advertising directed at\nconsumers.\" Appellant Reply Br. 28. None of the cases it cites,\nhowever, support this proposition, and we have found no cases\nlimiting Zauderer in such a way.\n\n                                     -31-\n\f            designed to create incentives within the\n            market   for   the  abandonment   of   certain\n            practices that are likely to unnecessarily\n            increase    cost   without    providing    any\n            corresponding benefit to the individual whose\n            prescription is being filled and that appear\n            to be designed merely to improve a drug\n            manufacturer's market share.\n\nPharm. Care Mgmt. Ass'n, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2339, at *82-83.\n\n            PCMA argues that the PBMs' interest in not disclosing,\n\nrather    than    being   minimal,    is   acute.    This    is     because   \"the\n\ncompelled speech takes their valuable property.\"              Appellant Reply\n\nBr. 28.    Aside from the fact that PCMA offers no proof supporting\n\nthis contention, we have already held that PCMA failed to show that\n\nthe UPDPA effects a taking of the PBMs' property.                 We do not see\n\nhow the situation is any different in the First Amendment context.\n\nWe think, therefore, that the district court was correct in holding\n\nthat UPDPA's provisions do not contravene the First Amendment.\n\nF.   Commerce Clause claim\n\n            The    district   court    held   that   the    UPDPA    was   not   in\n\nviolation of the Commerce Clause.             The Commerce Clause provides\n\nthat Congress shall have the power \"to regulate Commerce . . .\n\namong the several States.\"       U.S. Const. art. I, § 8, cl. 3.           It has\n\nlong been understood, however, that this affirmative grant of\n\nauthority to Congress necessarily encompasses a limitation on the\n\npower of states to enact legislation that burdens the flow of\n\ninterstate commerce.       This restriction on the states, known as the\n\ndormant Commerce Clause, is not absolute and in the absence of\n\n                                      -32-\n\fconflicting legislation by Congress, \"the States retain authority\n\nunder their general police powers to regulate matters of legitimate\n\nlocal concern, even though interstate commerce may be affected.\"\n\nMaine v. Taylor, 477 U.S. 131, 138 (1986) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n               PCMA argues that the UPDPA violates the dormant Commerce\n\nClause on two grounds.          First, it claims that the UPDPA has\n\n\"extraterritorial reach.\"       A state statute is per se invalid under\n\nthe dormant Commerce Clause when it \"regulates commerce wholly\n\noutside the state's borders or when the statute has a practical\n\neffect    of    controlling   conduct   outside   of   the   state.\"   Pharm.\n\nResearch & Mfrs. of Am., 249 F.3d at 79.               A statute has this\n\nimpermissible extraterritorial reach if it \"necessarily requires\n\nout-of-state commerce to be conducted according to in-state terms.\"\n\nId. (quoting Cotto Waxo Co. v. Williams, 46 F.3d 790, 794 (8th Cir.\n\n1995)).\n\n               The Supreme Court has discussed \"extraterritorial reach\"\n\nin a number of cases.         PCMA, for example, invokes Edgar v. MITE\n\nCorp., 457 U.S. 624, 640-43 (1982), a case involving an Illinois\n\nlaw that sought to regulate tender offers for the stock of Illinois\n\ncorporations.      The law required that all such offers be registered\n\nin advance with the Illinois Secretary of State.             Under the terms\n\nof the statute, a Delaware corporation soliciting the shares of an\n\nIllinois corporation from a resident of Arkansas would be required\n\n\n                                    -33-\n\fto register with the state of Illinois.           The Supreme Court,\n\nhowever, struck down the statute under the dormant Commerce Clause,\n\nnoting that the law \"directly regulates transactions which take\n\nplace across state lines, even if wholly outside the State of\n\nIllinois.\"   Edgar, 457 U.S. at 641.\n\n           The district court, similarly, discussed Brown-Forman\n\nDistillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Auth., 476 U.S. 573\n\n(1986). In that case, the Supreme Court invalidated a provision of\n\nthe New York Alcoholic Beverage Control Law that required liquor\n\ndistillers and producers doing business in New York to affirm that\n\ntheir prices were no higher than the lowest price at which the same\n\nproduct would be sold in any other state during the month.          The\n\nCourt determined that this was extraterritorial reach violative of\n\nthe Commerce Clause because during the period that the affirmation\n\nwas in effect, New York made it illegal, without prior permission\n\nfrom state authorities, for a distiller or producer to reduce its\n\nprice in other states. Thus, the New York law effectively regulated\n\nthe price at which liquor was sold in other states.        As the Court\n\nstated, \"[f]orcing a merchant to seek regulatory approval in one\n\nState   before   undertaking   a   transaction   in   another   directly\n\nregulates interstate commerce.\"      Brown-Forman, 476 U.S. at 582.\n\n           PCMA draws here on this idea of \"extraterritorial reach\"\n\nand attempts to apply it to the UPDPA. It argues that if a PBM\n\noperating outside of Maine enters into a contract outside of Maine\n\n\n                                   -34-\n\fwith a national insurer similarly operating beyond the state's\n\nborders but licensed in the state, the PBM would have to comply\n\nwith the UPDPA's disclosure requirements.             \"This is exactly the\n\nsort of extraterritorial reach condemned in Edgar v. MITE Corp.,\"\n\nsays PCMA.\n\n              We beg to differ.   There is a key difference between the\n\nUPDPA and the laws in Edgar and Brown-Forman.             In Edgar and Brown-\n\nForman, the state laws at issue gave the state power to determine\n\nwhether a transaction in another state could occur at all.                    For\n\nexample, the law in Edgar gave the Illinois Secretary of State\n\npower to determine whether to allow a tender offer by a Delaware\n\ncorporation for stock held by an Arkansas resident. Similarly, the\n\nNew York law in Brown-Forman gave the New York State Liquor\n\nAuthority power to determine whether a liquor distiller or producer\n\nwould be permitted to reduce its price in other states.                 It was\n\nthis   sort    of   \"extraterritorial     reach\"   that   led   the   Court   to\n\ninvalidate the statutes at issue in those cases.\n\n              The   UPDPA,   however,    does   not   give   Maine    any   such\n\nauthority. Under the UPDPA, a transaction outside of Maine between\n\ntwo parties -- for example, between PCMA's hypothetical out-of-\n\nstate PBM and insurance company -- can take place regardless of\n\nwhether Maine consents or not.          Maine law does not \"regulate . . .\n\n[the] out-of-state transaction, either by its express terms or by\n\nits inevitable effect.\"        Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am., 249 F.3d\n\n\n                                    -35-\n\fat 81.    Maine does not dictate the terms of such a transaction.\n\nNor is Maine in any way \"project[ing] its legislation\" into those\n\nother states.     Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc., 294 U.S. 511, 521\n\n(1935).     It simply requires that PBMs, should they choose to do\n\nbusiness within Maine, provide \"covered entities\" with certain\n\ninformation about their business relationships.                In other words,\n\nthe UPDPA does not require out-of-state commerce to be conducted\n\naccording    to   in-state   terms.    It    requires   only    that   in-state\n\ncommerce be conducted according to in-state terms.               See Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 22, § 2699(1)(B), (3) & (5) (2005) (showing that\n\nthe UPDPA covers only contracts entered in Maine with respect to\n\ncovered entities in Maine). In light of this distinction, we think\n\nthat the UPDPA cannot properly be said to have an extraterritorial\n\nreach violating the Commerce Clause.\n\n            Alternatively, PCMA argues that the UPDPA violates the\n\nCommerce Clause under the more lenient test set out by the Supreme\n\nCourt in Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc., 397 U.S. 137 (1970).                 Under\n\nthat test -- to be used when the state statute at issue regulates\n\nevenhandedly and has only incidental effects on interstate commerce\n\n-- courts employ a balancing approach whereby they examine whether\n\nthe state's interest is legitimate and whether the burden on\n\ninterstate commerce clearly exceeds the local benefits.                Pike, 397\n\nU.S. at 142.      Since we have held that the UPDPA is not per se\n\ninvalid because it does not effect any \"extraterritorial reach,\"\n\n\n                                      -36-\n\fand because the Maine statute does regulate evenhandedly and has\n\nonly incidental effects on interstate commerce, we employ here the\n\nPike balancing test to assess the constitutionality of the UPDPA.\n\n            In Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am., we noted that the Pike\n\ntest involves three separate steps.          First, we are to evaluate the\n\nnature of the putative local benefits advanced by the statute.\n\nSecond, we must examine the burden the statute places on interstate\n\ncommerce.      Finally, we are to consider whether the burden is\n\n\"clearly excessive\" as compared to the putative local benefits.\n\nPharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am., 249 F.3d at 83-84.\n\n            The putative local benefits of the UPDPA are clear.             The\n\naim of the UPDPA is to reduce the costs of, and increase the\n\npublic's access to, prescription drugs.             The law was designed to\n\ndeal with \"one of the serious problems of our time.\"               Id. at 80.\n\nPCMA, for its part, thinks these benefits are not likely to\n\nmaterialize as a result of the UPDPA.          It is not the place of this\n\ncourt, however, to pass judgment on the wisdom of the policies\n\nadopted   by   the   Maine    legislature.          See   Kassel   v.   Consol.\n\nFreightways    Corp.,   450   U.S.    662,    679    (1981)   (Brennan,    J.,\n\nconcurring) (stating that courts should refrain from attempting to\n\n\"second-guess the empirical judgments of lawmakers concerning the\n\nutility of legislation\").         Furthermore, as the district court\n\npoints out, under Pike, it is the putative local benefits that\n\n\n\n\n                                     -37-\n\fmatter.    It matters not whether these benefits actually come into\n\nbeing at the end of the day.\n\n           On the \"burden\" side of the Pike balancing equation, PCMA\n\nonly asserts that as a result of the UPDPA, certain PBMs will no\n\nlonger do business in Maine.   PCMA states that \"the extraordinary\n\nrestrictions imposed [by the UPDPA] on the business operations of\n\npharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) will make it virtually impossible\n\nto establish or maintain a prescription drug program that relies on\n\na for-profit PBM for administrative services.\"    In Pharm. Research\n\n& Mfrs. of Am., we said that \"[a]rguably, the only burden imposed\n\non interstate commerce by the . . . Act [in that case] is its\n\npossible effects on the profits of the individual manufacturers.\"\n\nPharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am., 249 F.3d at 84.    We think the same\n\nto be true here.   However, as we noted in Pharm. Research & Mfrs.\n\nof Am., such a burden is not violative of the Commerce Clause\n\nbecause the Clause \"protects the interstate market, not particular\n\ninterstate firms, from prohibitive or burdensome regulations.\" Id.\n\n(quoting Exxon Corp. v. Governor of Md., 437 U.S. 117, 127-28\n\n(1978)).\n\n           Even if such a burden was cognizable under the Commerce\n\nClause, at the very least the burden on interstate commerce in this\n\ninstance would not be \"clearly excessive\" as compared to the local\n\n\n\n\n                                -38-\n\fbenefits provided by the UPDPA.9     Pharm. Research & Mfrs. of Am.,\n\n249 F.3d at 84; see Edgar, 457 U.S. at 643 (\"[F]or even when a\n\nstate statute regulates interstate commerce indirectly, the burden\n\nimposed on that commerce must not be excessive in relation to the\n\nlocal interests served by the statute.\"). \"[T]he burden of proving\n\n'excessiveness' falls upon the [plaintiff], not the state,\" N.H.\n\nMotor Transp. Ass'n v. Flynn, 751 F.2d 43, 48 (1st Cir. 1984), and\n\nPCMA here has clearly failed to carry that burden.\n\n           Given the set of competing concerns we are presented with\n\nhere, we think the district court was correct in asserting that\n\nPCMA \"failed to provide the court with any great weight to place on\n\nthe excessive burden side of the scale.\"       Pharm. Care Mgmt. Ass'n,\n\n2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2339, at *73-74.          When measuring PCMA's\n\nconcern about its members' profits against the increased access to\n\nprescription drugs for Maine citizens, the local benefits clearly\n\noutweigh   any   incidental      burden   on    interstate   commerce.\n\nAccordingly, PCMA's Commerce Clause claim fails under the balancing\n\ntest set forth in Pike.\n\n                          III.    Conclusion\n\n           For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the decision\n\nof the district court.\n\n                      \"Concurrence follows.\"\n\n\n\n9\n   It is not the case, as the appellants claim, that \"the UPDPA\nmust fall if any burden is imposed on interstate commerce.\"\n\n                                  -39-\n\f             BOUDIN, Chief Judge, and DYK, Circuit Judge, Concurring.\n\nThe association standing question in this case is difficult. There\n\nis no well developed test in this circuit as to how the third prong\n\nof the Hunt test--whether \"the claim asserted [or] the relief\n\nrequested requires the participation of individual members in the\n\nlawsuit,\" Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333,\n\n343 (1977)--applies in cases where injunctive relief is sought.\n\nThis prong of the test is prudential rather than constitutional in\n\nnature, United Food & Commercial Workers Union Local 751 v. Brown\n\nGroup, Inc., 517 U.S. 544, 555 (1996), and there exists some\n\nlatitude in case-by-case judgments.\n\n             That only injunctive relief is sought here distinguishes\n\nthis case from damages cases; in those, association standing is\n\nprecluded where the damages turn upon the varying circumstances of\n\nthe individual plaintiffs. See Warth v. Seldin, 422 U.S. 490, 515-\n\n16 (1975).    Where only injunctive relief is sought, an association\n\nmay sometimes be allowed to sue even if some proof from individual\n\nnon-party    members   is   required;   on   the   other   hand,   plenty   of\n\ninjunction cases have been dismissed because of the need for\n\nindividualized proof.10\n\n\n\n\n10\n   E.g., Ga. Cemetery Ass'n. v. Cox, 353 F.3d 1319, 1322 (11th Cir.\n2003); Rent Stabilization Ass'n. v. Dinkins, 5 F.3d 591, 596-97 (2d\nCir. 1993); Kan. Health Care Ass'n. v. Kan. Dept. of Soc. & Rehab.\nSvcs., 958 F.2d 1018, 1022-23 (10th Cir. 1992).\n\n                                   -40-\n\f            There   is    one    decision      in   this   circuit   upholding\n\nassociation standing in a case dealing with injunctive relief.\n\nPlayboy Enters. v. Pub. Svc. Comm'n of P.R., 906 F.2d 25 (1st Cir.\n\n1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 959 (1990).              In that case, however,\n\nthe impact on individual members necessary for injunctive relief\n\nwas readily established as to at least one member.               Furthermore,\n\nthe challenged law in Playboy was a state statute regulating\n\nexpression; in such cases, courts are generally more inclined to\n\npermit jus tertii claims.        See Osediacz v. City of Cranston, 414\n\nF.3d 136, 140 (1st Cir. 2005).            Playboy is not an open door for\n\nassociation    standing     in    all     injunction    cases   where   member\n\ncircumstances differ and proof of them is important.\n\n            Sensibly, the Third Circuit in Pennsylvania Psychiatric\n\nSociety v. Green Spring Health Services, Inc., 280 F.3d 278 (3d\n\nCir. 2002), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 881 (2002), did not adopt an\n\nall-or-nothing test.       The court there stated that it would allow\n\nfor association standing if proof as to member circumstances were\n\n\"limited,\" but it noted that \"conferring associational standing\n\nwould be improper for claims requiring a fact-intensive-individual\n\ninquiry.\"     Id. at 286-87.      This is not a complete compendium of\n\nrelevant considerations, but it is a useful start.\n\n            In this case, putting to one side their generic weakness,\n\nindividual takings claims could in principle be significantly\n\nstrengthened or weakened by the particularized circumstances of\n\n\n                                        -41-\n\feach   individual       member.        Furthermore,     there    appears      to   be\n\nconsiderable      variation       in   each    member      company's   particular\n\ncircumstances--for example, whether a member already discloses the\n\ninformation in question to its customers, the methods by which it\n\nstores copies of its contracts, and so on.                   The district court\n\nacted reasonably in concluding that in this case the association\n\nshould not be allowed to sue as to the takings claim and that\n\nindividual members should bring their own cases.\n\n           However, as we are dealing with a matter of prudential\n\nstanding, the limitation has no Article III implications.                  Because\n\nat least some members could doubtless show that their materials\n\nwere not disclosed and were well protected, the district court\n\nsensibly   went    on    to   forestall       individual    actions    that    would\n\ninevitably follow a dismissal of the association's takings claim on\n\nstanding grounds.         It correctly held that even if association\n\nstanding were assumed to be adequate, such takings claims fail on\n\nthe merits.\n\n           Putting aside a separate threshold concern,11 the Supreme\n\nCourt in Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto, 467 U.S. 986 (1984), made clear\n\nthat   trade   secrets--as        defined     by   state    law--can   constitute\n\n\n\n11\n   Typically, no injunctive relief claim based on taking would be\nripe until state compensation remedies were exhausted, Williamson\nCounty Reg'l Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank of Johnson City, 473\nU.S. 172, 195 (1985), but because there may be some circumstances\nthat avoid this bar, see Philip Morris, Inc. v. Reilly, 312 F.3d 24\n(1st Cir. 2002) (en banc), we do not address this issue.\n\n                                        -42-\n\fproperty interests for Takings Clause purposes.                        Id. at 1003-04.\n\nIt   is   far       from    clear    that    the    Maine    courts    would   find    the\n\ninformation required to be disclosed here to represent a trade\n\nsecret under Maine law.               However, as there is no definitive state\n\ncourt judgment on this issue, it is possible that the information\n\nsought to be disclosed could potentially represent a valid property\n\ninterest for Takings Clause purposes.\n\n               Nevertheless, even assuming a property interest, the\n\nMaine statute does not work a full taking.                    It does not confiscate\n\nthe supposed trade secret in the conventional sense; at most, it\n\nrequires limited disclosure to customers of transactions possibly\n\nadverse to the customers' interests, which may reduce the value of\n\nthe trade secret to the PBM.                      PBMs may still negotiate rebate\n\ncontracts with drug companies, but their plan customers may--as a\n\nresult     of       PBMs'     disclosures--look            elsewhere    for     benefits\n\nmanagement.\n\n               In     this        context,   a     takings     claim    is     far    from\n\nstraightforward. In Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New\n\nYork, 438 U.S. 104 (1978), the Supreme Court--while noting that\n\nsuch analyses are \"essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries\"--outlined\n\nthree relevant factors in determining whether a regulation effects\n\na    taking:    (1)        \"the    extent    to    which    the   regulation     [would]\n\ninterfere[] with distinct investment-backed expectations\"; (2)\n\n\"[t]he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant\"; and (3)\n\n\n                                             -43-\n\f\"the character of the governmental action.\"   Id. at 124.   Given the\n\nabsence of a full-scale taking and the presence of a traditional\n\nregulatory interest, it is enough to defeat the takings claim that\n\nno reasonable investment-backed expectation is present at all. See\n\nGood v. United States, 189 F.3d 1355, 1363 (Fed. Cir. 1999), cert.\n\ndenied, 529 U.S. 1053 (2000).\n\n           Under the terms of the statute, the PBMs' disclosure\n\nrequirements run only to their \"covered entity\" customers and apply\n\nonly to contracts entered into or renewed after the statute's\n\neffective date, namely, September 13, 2003 (three months after the\n\nstatute was enacted).   As the district court noted, PBMs and drug\n\nmanufacturers typically negotiate their rebate terms on an annual\n\nbasis.    More than two years have elapsed since the statute gave\n\nwarning of the new regime (in June 2003), so one-year rebate\n\ncontracts negotiated before that date have expired or have been\n\nrenewed in the teeth of the statute, and any rebate contracts first\n\nentered into after June 2003 would have been made with knowledge of\n\nthe statute's requirements.   There is no basis for forward-looking\n\ninjunctive relief with respect to rebate contracts entered into\n\nafter the statute's effective date.\n\n           Even as applied to trade secrets arising before the\n\nstatute's effective date, the statute would not constitute a\n\ntaking.   \"A manufacturer or vendor has no constitutional right to\n\nsell goods without giving to the purchaser fair information of what\n\n\n                                -44-\n\fit is that is being sold.\"           Corn Prods. Ref. Co. v. Eddy, 249 U.S.\n\n427,    431    (1919).       PBMs    should     therefore   have     expected   the\n\npossibility that they would have to disclose to their covered\n\nentity      customers      information    needed    to    forestall     what   could\n\nreasonably be deemed abusive control.              PBMs are undoubtedly aware\n\nof the heavily regulated nature of the healthcare industry; in\n\nfact, as the district court noted, they are already subject to\n\nextensive regulation under federal and state law.\n\n               If PBMs truly assumed that they would be free from\n\ndisclosure requirements of the sort set forth in the Maine law\n\nhere,       this   would    be    more   wishful   thinking    than     reasonable\n\nexpectation.        Whether or not the law strikes the right economic\n\nbalance between competing producer and consumer interests, it is no\n\nmore    a    taking   than    the   requirement     that    public    corporations\n\ndisclose private corporate information about financial prospects to\n\nthe public through regular SEC filings.\n\n               Lastly,     PCMA's   First     Amendment    claim   is   completely\n\nwithout merit.           So-called \"compelled speech\" may under modern\n\nSupreme Court jurisprudence raise a serious First Amendment concern\n\nwhere it effects a forced association between the speaker and a\n\nparticular viewpoint.            See, e.g., Wooley v. Maynard, 430 U.S. 705\n\n(1977) (requiring all New Hampshire drivers to display \"Live Free\n\nor Die\" on their license plates); Miami Herald Publ'g Co. v.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -45-\n\fTornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974) (requiring newspapers to afford\n\npolitical candidates a right to reply to editorial critiques).\n\n               What is at stake here, by contrast, is simply routine\n\ndisclosure of economically significant information designed to\n\nforward ordinary regulatory purposes--in this case, protecting\n\ncovered entities from questionable PBM business practices.                       There\n\nare literally thousands of similar regulations on the books--such\n\nas product labeling laws, environmental spill reporting, accident\n\nreports by common carriers, SEC reporting as to corporate losses\n\nand    (most    obviously)     the   requirement     to   file    tax      returns   to\n\ngovernment       units   who    use     the    information       to     the     obvious\n\ndisadvantage of the taxpayer.\n\n               The idea that these thousands of routine regulations\n\nrequire    an    extensive      First    Amendment    analysis        is      mistaken.\n\nZauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel, 471 U.S. 626 (1985),\n\nmakes clear \"that an advertiser's rights are adequately protected\n\nas long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the\n\nState's interest in preventing deception of consumers.\"                         Id. at\n\n651.     This is a test akin to the general rational basis test\n\ngoverning all government regulations under the Due Process Clause.\n\nThe test is so obviously met in this case as to make elaboration\n\npointless.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -46-\n\f",

Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2699 (2005). PCMA brought suit against defendant-appellee G. Steven Rowe, Attorney General of the State of Maine, seeking to obtain an order enjoining enforcement of the UPDPA. The parties issued cross-motions for summary judgment, and the district court denied PCMA's motion and granted the motion of the Attorney General. PCMA now appeals this decision. For the reasons hereinafter stated, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PCMA is a national trade association of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). PBMs are major players in the delivery of health care in the United States. They act as middlemen in the lucrative business of providing prescription drugs. They serve as intermediaries between pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmacies on the one hand (as the district court noted, the \"supply\" side of the trade) and health benefit providers (e.g., insurers, self-insured entities, health maintenance organizations, and public and private health plans) on the other (the \"demand\" side). The services that PBMs extend are designed to facilitate the provision of prescription drug benefits to the people who utilize the services of the health benefit providers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, PBMs often provide health benefit providers with access to an established network of pharmacies, where customers of the health benefit providers can obtain drugs at certain set prices. PBMs negotiate volume discounts and rebates with drug manufacturers by pooling substantial numbers of health benefit providers. This pooling gives the PBMs tremendous market power to demand concessions from the manufacturers. PBMs also provide drug utilization review services and \"therapeutic interchange programs\" (in other words, substituting a drug for the one actually prescribed by a doctor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this role as intermediary, however, PBMs have the opportunity to engage in activities that may benefit the drug manufacturers and PBMs financially to the detriment of the health benefit providers. For example, in cases of \"therapeutic interchange,\" a PBM may substitute a more expensive brand name drug for an equally effective and cheaper generic drug. This is done so that the PBM can collect a fee from the manufacturer for helping to increase the manufacturer's market share within a certain drug category. Similarly, a PBM might receive a discount from a manufacturer on a particular drug but not pass any of it on to the health benefit provider, keeping the difference for itself. The health benefit provider, however, often has no idea that a PBM may not be working in its interest. This lack of awareness is the result of the fact that there is little transparency in a PBM's dealings with manufacturers and pharmacies. As the district court noted, \"[w]hether and how a PBM actually saves an individual benefits provider customer money with respect to the purchase of a particular prescription drug is largely a mystery to the benefits provider.\" <i>Pharm. Care Mgmt. Ass'n v. Rowe,</i> No. 05-1606, 2005 WL 757608, at *2, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2339, at *6 (D.Me. Feb. 2, 2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the aim of placing Maine health benefit providers in a better position to determine whether PBMs are acting against their interests, and correspondingly, to help control prescription drug costs and increase access to prescription drugs, the Maine Legislature enacted the UPDPA in the spring of 2003. The UPDPA imposes a number of requirements on those PBMs that choose to enter into contracts in Maine with \"covered entities\" &#8212; meaning health benefit providers and including, in part, insurance companies, the state Medicaid program, and employer health plans. Such PBMs are required to act as fiduciaries for their clients and adhere to certain specific duties. For example, they must disclose conflicts of interest, disgorge profits from self-dealing, and disclose to the covered entities certain of their financial arrangements with third parties. Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167;&#167; 2699(2)(A-G) (2005). The disclosures made by the PBMs to the covered entities are protected by confidentiality. None of the disclosures are available to the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PCMA, on behalf of its member PBMs, challenges the UPDPA on five separate grounds. First, it claims that the Maine law was preempted by either the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\") or the Federal Employee Health Benefits Act (\"FEHBA\"). PCMA's second argument is that the UPDPA violates the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it conditions doing business in Maine upon the forced disclosure or taking of proprietary information. Third, PCMA states that the provisions of the UPDPA violate due process because they provide no pre-deprivation hearing. Fourth, the association claims that the UPDPA disclosure provisions violate the First Amendment by compelling commercial speech in the context of a voluntary business relationship. PCMA's final argument is that the UPDPA violates the Commerce Clause, either through its \"extraterritorial reach\" or by excessively burdening interstate commerce.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the proceedings below, the parties issued cross-motions for summary judgment.

Coyne,</i> 482 U.S. 1, 11, 107 S.Ct. 2211, 96 L.Ed.2d 1 (1987). PCMA here claims that the UPDPA is preempted by ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>1.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In examining PCMA's preemption claim, a threshold issue we must confront is whether the PBMs act as ERISA fiduciaries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> This is an issue with high stakes, for classification as a fiduciary or a nonfiduciary renders a defendant liable for different types of damages. For example, under sections 409 and 502(a)(2) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1109(a), 1132(a)(2), an ERISA fiduciary is personally liable for monetary damages, for restitution, and for \"such other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1109(a). A non-fiduciary, however, is not subject to monetary damages in a suit brought under ERISA. <i>See Mertens v. Hewitt Assocs.,</i> 508 U.S. 248, 262, 113 S.Ct. 2063, 124 L.Ed.2d 161 (1993) (noting how \"[p]rofessional service providers such as actuaries become liable for damages when they cross the line from adviser to fiduciary\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under ERISA, a fiduciary is one who exercises discretionary authority or control in the management and administration of an ERISA plan. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(21)(A). <i>See also Mertens,</i> 508 U.S. at 251, 262, 113 S.Ct. 2063. The Attorney General argues that since PBMs do not exercise discretionary authority or control in the management and administration of ERISA plans, they are not fiduciaries under the definition provided for under ERISA. PCMA, in contrast, claims that the UPDPA makes PBMs fiduciaries in performing administration activities for ERISA plans. The UPDPA, after all, targets PBMs that contract with \"covered entities\" &#8212; insurance companies, the state Medicaid program, and employer health plans &#8212; some of which may be ERISA plans. The UPDPA requires PBMs to be fiduciaries of the covered entities with which they contract. Therefore, when a PBM contracts with a covered entity that happens to be an ERISA plan, the PBM is a fiduciary of that ERISA plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the UPDPA does impose certain fiduciary duties on the PBMs, these are duties imposed under state law. The key issue here, however, is whether the PBMs are fiduciaries under the definition of a fiduciary provided in ERISA. Our review of the requirements imposed on the PBMs under the UPDPA lead us to believe that the PBMs do not exercise \"discretionary authority or control in the management and administration of the plan.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(21)(A). For example, the UPDPA provisions requiring disclosure of conflicts of interest and payments from drug manufacturers are administrative provisions involving no discretion on the part of the PBMs. Such duties are purely ministerial and simply not sufficient for us to find that the PBMs are acting as fiduciaries under ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With that threshold matter disposed of, we are now able to confront the main issue at hand: Is the UPDPA preempted by ERISA? PCMA claims that ERISA does preempt the UPDPA because ERISA preempts all state laws that \"relate to any ERISA covered employee benefit plan,\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a), regardless of whether an entity is acting as a fiduciary or not. The state, in contrast, argues that the UPDPA is not preempted by ERISA because ERISA only preempts state laws relating to acts performed by ERISA fiduciaries. Since the PBMs regulated by the UPDPA are not fiduciaries under ERISA, there can be no preemption in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To answer the question of what exactly ERISA preempts, we first turn to the statute itself. ERISA's preemption provision states explicitly that ERISA \"shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a) (2000). Looking only at the face of the statute, then, it appears that PCMA is correct. With its broad and expansive language, the ERISA preemption provision seems to say that all state laws that in any way \"relate to\" any ERISA-covered employee benefit plan are preempted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court, however, has stated that the language of the ERISA preemption provision is not as broad as it seems. The Court has emphasized that the expansive language of the provision is still subject to \"the starting presumption that Congress does not intend to supplant state law\" and has warned \"that, unless congressional intent to preempt clearly appears, ERISA will not be deemed to supplant state law in areas traditionally regulated by the states.\" <i>New York State Conf. of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v. Travelers Ins. Co.,</i> 514 U.S. 645, 654, 661, 115 S.Ct. 1671, 131 L.Ed.2d 695 (1995); <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26 v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co.,</i> 215 F.3d 136, 139-40 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Realizing, then, that the exact scope of the ERISA preemption provision is imprecise and that the provision cannot be read literally, the Court has developed a two-part test to determine exactly what state laws ERISA preempts. The test established by the Court begins with reference to the preemption provision itself. As already stated, ERISA expressly preempts \"any and all State laws insofar as they . . . relate to any employee benefit plan.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a) (2000). \"[T]he incidence of ERISA preemption turns on the parameters of the phrase `relate to.'\" <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26,</i> 215 F.3d at 139. The Court has stated that a particular state law \"relates to\" an employee benefit plan \"if it [1] has a connection with or [2] a reference to such a plan.\" <i>California Div. of Labor Standards Enforcement v. Dillingham Constr., N.A., Inc.,</i> 519 U.S. 316, 324, 117 S.Ct. 832, 136 L.Ed.2d 791 (1997); <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26,</i> 215 F.3d at 140. We use this test to determine whether the UPDPA is preempted by ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a) The \"connection with\" prong</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has stated that when determining whether a state law has a \"connection with\" ERISA plans, a court must avoid an \"uncritical literalism\" and look instead to \"the objectives of the ERISA statute as a guide to the scope of the state law that Congress understood would survive, as well as to the nature of the effect of the state law on ERISA plans.\" <i>Egelhoff v. Egelhoff,</i> 532 U.S. 141, 147, 121 S.Ct. 1322, 149 L.Ed.2d 264 (2001) (citing <i>Travelers,</i> 514 U.S. at 656, 115 S.Ct. 1671 and <i>Dillingham,</i> 519 U.S. at 325, 117 S.Ct. 832) (internal quotation marks omitted). According to the Court, \"[t]he basic thrust of the pre-emption clause . . . was to avoid a multiplicity of regulation in order to permit the nationally uniform administration of employee benefit plans.\" <i>Travelers,</i> 514 U.S. at 657, 115 S.Ct. 1671. State laws that impede this goal of national uniformity will be preempted. Therefore, we must determine here whether the UPDPA, in placing fiduciary duties and administrative burdens on PBMs operating in Maine, thereby precludes the ability of plan administrators to administer their plans in a uniform fashion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In several different cases, the Supreme Court has found this goal of \"national uniformity\" to be compromised (and therefore the state law was preempted). For example, in <i>Alessi v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc.,</i> 451 U.S. 504, 526, 101 S.Ct. 1895, 68 L.Ed.2d 402 (1981), the Court invalidated a New Jersey law that prohibited offsetting worker compensation payments against pension benefits. \"Since such a practice [was] permissible under federal law and the law of other States, the effect of the [state] statute was to force the employer either to structure all its benefit payments in accordance with New Jersey law, or to adopt different payment formulae for employees inside and outside the State.\" <i>Fort Halifax,</i> 482 U.S. at 10, 107 S.Ct. 2211 (discussing the holding in <i>Alessi</i>). Similarly, in <i>Egelhoff,</i> the Supreme Court found that \"[u]niformity [was] impossible\" with regard to a Washington statute that provided that the designation of a spouse as the beneficiary of a nonprobate asset was revoked automatically upon divorce. <i>Egelhoff,</i> 532 U.S. at 148, 121 S.Ct. 1322. The Court held that the statute was preempted by ERISA because \"[p]lan administrators [could not] make payments simply by identifying the beneficiary specified by the plan documents. Instead, they [had to] familiarize themselves with [specific] state statutes so that they [could] determine whether the named beneficiary's status [had] been `revoked' by operation of law.\" <i>Id.</i> at 148-49, 121 S.Ct. 1322.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to the state laws at issue in <i>Alessi</i> and <i>Egelhoff,</i> the goal of national uniformity poses no problems in the instant case. In no way does the UPDPA circumscribe the ability of plan administrators to structure or administer their ERISA plans. As the district court stated, \"[t]he fact that the UPDPA requires PBMs to engage in certain `required practices' in Maine, such as divulging the terms of contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers and labelers does not restrict the freedom of employee benefit plans to administer or structure their plans in Maine precisely as they would elsewhere.\" <i>Pharm. Care Mgmt. Ass'n,</i> 2005 WL 757608, at *7, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2339, at *23-24. This is simply not a case where \"uniformity is impossible . . . [because] plans are subject to different legal obligations in different States.\" <i>Egelhoff,</i> 532 U.S. at 148, 121 S.Ct. 1322.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In attempting to demonstrate that the UPDPA would require employee benefit plans to implement unique measures in Maine, PCMA points to the way in which the UPDPA attempts \"to dictate the terms of contracts between ERISA plans and PBMs, including by redefining the duties and liabilities of PBMs to such plans, their sponsors and participants.\" PCMA also points out how the UPDPA \"attempts to regulate plans' relationship[s] with PBMs when PBMs perform administrative functions for such plans.\" Although the ERISA plans can re-evaluate their working relationships with the PBMs if they wish in light of the UPDPA, nothing in the UPDPA compels them to do so. This is not an instance, such as that confronted by the Supreme Court in <i>Egelhoff,</i> where the plan administrators were <i>bound</i> to a particular choice of rules &#8212; rules mandated by the state for determining beneficiary status. The plan administrators here have a free hand to structure the plans as they wish in Maine. We find, therefore, that the UPDPA does not have an impermissible \"connection with\" ERISA plans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b) The \"reference to\" prong</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A state law is preempted by ERISA by virtue of an impermissible \"reference to\" an ERISA plan \"[w]here a State's law acts immediately and exclusively upon ERISA plans . . . or where the existence of ERISA plans is essential to the law's operation.\" <i>Dillingham,</i> 519 U.S. at 325, 117 S.Ct. 832.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26,</i> when explaining the scope of this test in light of the Supreme Court's decisions in <i>Travelers</i> and <i>Dillingham,</i> we discussed two prior precedents of our own: <i>McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.,</i> 950 F.2d 13 (1st Cir.1991) and <i>Williams v. Ashland Eng'g Co.,</i> 45 F.3d 588 (1st Cir.1995). <i>McCoy</i> dealt with a Massachusetts mechanics' lien statute that, \"by its terms, inured to the advantage of `the trustee or trustees of any fund or funds, established pursuant to section 302 of the Taft Hartley [Act].'\" <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26,</i> 215 F.3d at 142 (noting also that any plan that grants benefits under section 302 is by definition an ERISA plan). <i>Williams,</i> in contrast, dealt with a bond statute covering public works projects. <i>Id.</i> at 143. We noted that this bond statute differed from the mechanics' lien statute in <i>McCoy</i> in that the \"bond statute makes no direct reference to section 302\" (and hence, no direct reference to ERISA) and in that the language of the bond statute was not at all \"ERISA-specific.\" <i>Id.</i> The relevant language in <i>Williams</i> stood \"at the end of a long list of items,\" most of which had \"nothing whatever to do with ERISA.\" <i>Id.</i> In <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26,</i> we noted that the specific reference to an ERISA plan in <i>McCoy</i> was what gave rise to ERISA preemption. <i>Id.</i> at 142.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the UPDPA is similar to the state law at issue in <i>Williams.</i> The existence of ERISA plans is not at all essential to the operation of the UPDPA. The UPDPA applies regardless of whether PBMs are serving ERISA plans. The law applies with respect to a broad spectrum of health care institutions and health benefit providers, including but not limited to ERISA plans. \"Covered entities\" under the UPDPA includes health plans, labor union plans, association plans, insurance companies, HMOs, medical service organizations, and the state Medicaid program. Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2699(1)(A).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PCMA, in support of its proposition that ERISA plans are essential to the UPDPA's operation, cites to <i>Dist. of Columbia v. Greater Washington Bd. of Trade,</i> 506 U.S. 125, 113 S.Ct. 580, 121 L.Ed.2d 513 (1992). In that case, the law at issue required an employer who provided health insurance coverage to its employees to provide equivalent coverage to injured employees eligible for workers' compensation benefits. The coverage for injured employees was \"measured by reference to `the existing health insurance coverage' provided by the employer,\" which the Court found to be a \"reference to\" an ERISA plan and therefore preempted under ERISA. <i>Id.</i> at 130, 113 S.Ct. 580.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we pointed out in <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26,</i> however, the law at issue in <i>Greater Washington</i> contained a specific reference to an ERISA plan. <i>See Carpenters Local Union No. 26,</i> 215 F.3d at 144 n. 7. Such a law would be completely inoperable if the reference to the ERISA plan were omitted. It relied on the reference for its operation. The UPDPA, in contrast, has no such deficiency. Although the UPDPA does operate to regulate PBMs that contract with employee health plans &#8212; some of which may happen to be ERISA plans &#8212; it also operates upon the state Medicaid program and on insurance companies. If the reference to employee health plans was deleted from the text of the UPDPA, the statute would still be operable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> As we have stated previously, \"[a] state law that applies to a wide variety of situations, including an appreciable number that have no specific linkage to ERISA plans, constitutes a law of general application for purposes of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144.\" <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26,</i> 215 F.3d at 144-45 (adding that \"state laws of general application are safe from ERISA preemption\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c) Alternative enforcement mechanism</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PCMA, therefore, is unable to show that the UPDPA \"relates to\" an employee benefit plan under either the \"connection with\" or \"reference to\" prongs of the test prescribed by the Supreme Court. PCMA, however, offers an alternative argument. It states that the UPDPA's remedial scheme (i.e., the UPDPA's enforcement provision in Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2699(4) (2005)) conflicts with the \"exclusive\" remedial scheme set forth by Congress in ERISA (in 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132 (2000)) and is therefore preempted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The civil enforcement provision of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132 (2000), provides a mechanism by which plan participants, beneficiaries, fiduciaries, and the Secretary of Labor can sue to enforce rights expressly guaranteed by ERISA. 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1132 (2000) (ERISA &#167; 502(a)). Accordingly, \"ERISA preemption proscribes the type of alternative enforcement mechanism that purposes to provide a remedy for the violation of a right expressly guaranteed and exclusively enforced by the ERISA statute.\" <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26,</i> 215 F.3d at 141. In <i>Ingersoll-Rand Co. v. McClendon,</i> 498 U.S. 133, 111 S.Ct. 478, 112 L.Ed.2d 474 (1990), the Supreme Court specifically recognized that a state law can be preempted as an alternative enforcement mechanism to ERISA &#167; 502(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">ERISA, however, does not preempt state laws that \"touch upon enforcement but have no real bearing on the intricate web of relationships among the principal players in the ERISA scenario (e.g., the plan, the administrators, the fiduciaries, the beneficiaries, and the employer).\" <i>Carpenters Union Local No. 26,</i> 215 F.3d at 141. Here, the UPDPA targets the PBMs, which, as stated above, are not ERISA fiduciaries. As such, they are outside of the \"intricate web of relationships among the principal players in the ERISA scenario.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court correctly noted that \"[a]lthough ERISA prescribes the duties that are owed by ERISA entities to one another, and prescribes remedies for their breach, it is not designed to regulate or afford remedies against entities that provide services to plans.\" <i>Pharm. Care Mgmt. Ass'n,</i> 2005 WL 757608, at 9, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2339, at *28-29. Therefore, we hold that the UPDPA does not provide an alternative enforcement mechanism to ERISA's civil enforcement scheme and is not preempted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PCMA, however, points to the Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>Aetna Health, Inc. v. Davila,</i> 542 U.S. 200, 124 S.Ct. 2488, 159 L.Ed.2d 312 (2004). PCMA argues that in <i>Davila,</i> the Court held that state causes of action purporting to supplement ERISA &#167; 502(a) are preempted \"even if the elements of the state cause of action [do] not precisely duplicate the elements of an ERISA claim.\" <i>Id.</i> at 2499-2500. In that case, however, the plaintiffs were plan participants and beneficiaries who brought suit \"only to rectify a wrongful denial of benefits promised under ERISA-regulated plans\" and who did not attempt to remedy any violation of a legal duty independent of ERISA. <i>Id.</i> at 2492-93, 2498. In other words, all the parties in that case were part of the \"intricate web of relationships among the principal players in the ERISA scenario.\" <i>Carpenters Union Local No. 26,</i> 215 F.3d at 141. That was the reason that the state remedy in that case was preempted. Therefore, PCMA's use of <i>Davila</i> is misplaced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Takings claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the UPDPA, PBMs are required to disclose to their customers in Maine information concerning the discounts and other contract terms that they are able to negotiate with drug manufacturers and pharmacies. According to the PCMA, this information is confidential and proprietary and is to be considered a \"trade secret.\" Because the UPDPA requires PBMs to disclose these trade secrets as a condition of doing business in Maine, PCMA contends that the UPDPA effects a regulatory taking, and this requires \"just compensation\" under the Fifth Amendment. \"A regulatory taking transpires when some significant restriction is placed upon an owner's use of his property for which `justice and fairness' require that compensation be given.\" <i>Philip Morris Inc. v.

Also, the court noted that because some PBMs might not be affected if they did not possess trade secrets (because they had already contracted away access to this information), the claim would require member-by-member scrutiny. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PCMA is indeed required to introduce evidence \"pertaining to how, inter alia, one or more of its members develops, and maintains the secrecy of, its information and how one or more of its members would be injured by disclosure.\" <i>Pharm.

(emphasis in original). We think that to be true here. Even though a takings inquiry is intensely fact specific and PCMA will be required to introduce proof of specific PBM practices and effects of the UPDPA on specific PBMs, we see no reason that PCMA's member PBMs would be required to participate as parties in this litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Playboy Enters.,</i> we discussed the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Warth v. Seldin,</i> 422 U.S. 490, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). <i>Playboy Enters.,</i> 906 F.2d at 35. In <i>Warth,</i> the Court held that an association had no standing to sue on behalf of its members when seeking monetary relief to compensate for its members' injuries. <i>Warth,</i> 422 U.S. at 515-16, 95 S.Ct. 2197. In <i>Playboy Enters.,</i> we noted that \"the crucial reason [in <i>Warth</i>] for <i>requiring</i> the members' participation as parties must have been so that the members [rather than the association] could recover their own damages, should they prevail.\" <i>Playboy Enters.,</i> 906 F.2d at 35 (emphasis in original). The association in that case was not entitled to be compensated for the various injuries suffered by its members. \"The members' participation <i>as parties</i> was necessary so that judgment could be entered in their favor.\" <i>Id.</i> at 35-36 (emphasis in original). In the instant case, however, there is no similar claim for monetary damages. PCMA requests only equitable relief. Such a remedy would, if granted, \"inure to the benefit of those members of the association actually injured.\" <i>Warth,</i> 422 U.S. at 515, 95 S.Ct. 2197. There is, in other words, no need here for the member PBMs to participate as parties. As such, PCMA does have associational standing to assert its claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the disposal of that threshold jurisdictional issue, we can now address the merits of PCMA's takings claim. Here, PCMA brings a facial challenge to the UPDPA, asserting that the UPDPA violates the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it conditions doing business in Maine upon the forced disclosure or taking of proprietary information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the takings context, a facial challenge is usually ripe \"the moment the challenged regulation or ordinance is passed.\" <i>Suitum v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency,</i> 520 U.S. 725, 736 n. 10, 117 S.Ct. 1659, 137 L.Ed.2d 980 (1997). To succeed on a facial challenge to a statute, however, is very difficult. As we have noted before, a plaintiff wishing to bring a facial challenge \"face[s] an uphill battle.\" <i>Reilly,</i> 312 F.3d at 52 (Lipez, J., dissenting) (quoting <i>Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis,</i> 480 U.S. 470, 495, 107 S.Ct. 1232, 94 L.Ed.2d 472 (1987)). \"A facial challenge to a legislative Act is . . . the most difficult challenge to mount successfully, since the challenger must establish that no set of circumstances exists under which the Act would be valid.\" <i>Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs. of Am. v. Concannon,</i> 249 F.3d 66, 77 (1st Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, this would mean that PCMA has the burden to prove that <i>every</i> disclosure under the UPDPA, if uncompensated, would result in an unconstitutional taking.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PCMA, however, has not met this burden. This is a result of the differing circumstances of PCMA's member PBMs. There are certain PBMs that have already disclosed extensive information to their clients, pursuant to contract or in the context of annual audits. The state writes, for example, about how</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . Medco [a PBM] allows United Healthcare [a client] virtually unfettered access to Medco's contracts, contract terms, rebates, records and information; virtually complete audit rights; and even the ability to participate in negotiations with the drug manufacturers. Appellee Br. 31-32.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of this information is now also required to be disclosed under the UPDPA. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2699(2)(D) (2005) (requiring disclosure of all financial and utilization information requested by a covered entity relating to the provision of services to that covered entity).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">None of this information, however, can in any way be considered a trade secret. Under Maine law, a trade secret is \"information. . . that . . . [d]erives independent economic value . . . from not being generally known to and not being readily ascertainable by proper means by other persons who can obtain economic value from its disclosure or use and . . . is the subject of efforts that are reasonable under the circumstances to maintain its secrecy.\" Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 10, &#167; 1542(4) (2005). <i>See also Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto Co.,</i> 467 U.S. 986, 1002, 104 S.Ct. 2862, 81 L.Ed.2d 815 (1984) (\"Because of the intangible nature of a trade secret, the extent of the property right therein is defined by the extent to which the owner of the secret protects his interest from disclosure to others.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The information disclosed as a result of these client contracts, however, is readily available. The record is replete with evidence demonstrating that the PBMs that made these contracts have taken no special steps to protect their information. For example, Timothy Wentworth, the group President of National Accounts for Medco, stated that he was not aware of any written security policy prohibiting the removal of client contracts at Medco. Other PBMs keep these client contracts in unlocked cabinets \"in public areas such as hallways.\" Therefore, such information &#8212; at least under Maine law &#8212; cannot be considered a \"trade secret.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that there are no trade secrets involved with these client contracts, there is no \"property\" subject to the Takings Clause. <i>See Monsanto,</i> 467 U.S. at 1002, 104 S.Ct. 2862 (\"If an individual discloses his trade secret to others who are under no obligation to protect the confidentiality of the information, or otherwise publicly discloses the secret, his property right is extinguished.\"). Hence, many disclosures required from the PBMs under the UPDPA would not be considered unconstitutional takings. Therefore, PCMA cannot show that <i>every</i> disclosure under the UPDPA will result in an unconstitutional taking, for there are clear and obvious circumstances when disclosures under the UPDPA <i>are not</i> unconstitutional takings. We therefore hold that PCMA's facial takings claim fails on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Due Process claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the district court recognized, this claim \"tags along\" with PCMA's takings claim. In <i>Zinermon v. Burch,</i> 494 U.S. 113, 132, 110 S.Ct. 975, 108 L.Ed.2d 100 (1990), the Supreme Court held that due process requires that \"[i]n situations where the State feasibly can provide a predeprivation hearing before taking property, it generally must do so regardless of the adequacy of a postdeprivation tort remedy to compensate for the taking.\" As we have already discussed, however, PCMA has not been able to show that the UPDPA effects a taking. Since there is no taking and no deprivation, it follows that no predeprivation hearing is required. The district court was therefore correct to grant summary judgment in favor of the state on this claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. First Amendment claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also found that the provisions of the UPDPA do not violate the First Amendment. PCMA claims that the UPDPA violates the First Amendment because it compels PBMs to engage in speech &#8212; in the form of mandated disclosures &#8212; as a condition of doing business in Maine. In a number of different cases, the Supreme Court has recognized that compulsion to speak may be as violative of the First Amendment as prohibitions on speech. <i>See, e.g., Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel of the Supreme</i> <i>Court of Ohio,</i> 471 U.S. 626, 105 S.Ct. 2265, 85 L.Ed.2d 652 (1985); <i>Wooley v. Maynard,</i> 430 U.S. 705, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977); <i>Miami Herald Publ'g Co. v. Tornillo,</i> 418 U.S. 241, 94 S.Ct. 2831, 41 L.Ed.2d 730 (1974). We agree with PCMA that a compelled disclosure, such as the one here, does indeed implicate the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In assessing whether the disclosures mandated by the UPDPA are violative of the provisions of the First Amendment, the initial question we must confront is the nature of the speech. The degree of protection afforded by the First Amendment depends on whether the speech here is commercial speech or noncommercial speech.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> \"`[C]ommercial speech' is entitled to the protection of the First Amendment, albeit to protection somewhat less extensive than that afforded `noncommercial speech.'\" <i>Zauderer,</i> 471 U.S. at 637, 105 S.Ct. 2265; <i>see also Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar Ass'n.,</i> 436 U.S. 447, 456, 98 S.Ct. 1912, 56 L.Ed.2d 444 (1978) (\"[W]e . . . have afforded commercial speech a limited measure of protection, commensurate with its subordinate position in the scale of First Amendment values, while allowing modes of regulation that might be impermissible in the realm of noncommercial expression.\"); <i>Bolger v. Youngs Drug Prods. Corp.,</i> 463 U.S. 60, 64-65, 103 S.Ct. 2875, 77 L.Ed.2d 469 (1983) (\"[t]he Constitution accords less protection to commercial speech than to other constitutionally safeguarded forms of expression.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the speech here is of a commercial nature, there is a reduced burden on the state to justify the UPDPA. <i>See Zauderer,</i> 471 U.S. at 650-651, 105 S.Ct. 2265; <i>Riley v. Nat'l Fed'n of the Blind of North Carolina, Inc.,</i> 487 U.S. 781, 796 n. 9, 108 S.Ct. 2667, 101 L.Ed.2d 669 (1988) (\"Purely commercial speech is more susceptible to compelled disclosure requirements.\"). If, however, the speech is of a noncommercial nature, the compelled disclosure will be subject to \"exacting First Amendment scrutiny.\" <i>Riley,</i> 487 U.S. at 798, 108 S.Ct. 2667. In such a case, the state, to justify its law, would have to advance a compelling state interest and also show that the means chosen to accomplish that interest are narrowly tailored. <i>See id.</i> at 795, 108 S.Ct. 2667 (noting that a statute that mandates speech \"that a speaker would not otherwise make necessarily alters the content of the speech\" and that such a statute is therefore considered a content-based regulation of speech); <i>Madsen v. Women's Health Ctr.,</i> 512 U.S. 753, 790-91, 114 S.Ct. 2516, 129 L.Ed.2d 593 (1994) (noting that content-based regulations receive strict scrutiny).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have stated that commercial speech is defined as \"expression related solely to the economic interests of the speaker and its audience.\" <i>El Dia, Inc. v. Puerto Rico Dept. of Consumer Affairs,</i> 413 F.3d 110, 115 (1st Cir.2005) (citing <i>Central Hudson Gas &amp; Elec. Corp. v. Public Serv. Comm'n of New York,</i> 447 U.S. 557, 561, 100 S.Ct. 2343, 65 L.Ed.2d 341 (1980)). Although it is a close question, we think that the speech mandated by the UPDPA meets this definition. Many of the UPDPA's provisions are overtly geared at the economic interests of the PBMs and the covered entities. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2699(2)(F) (requiring PBMs to disclose and disgorge any payment or benefit based on volume of sales or classes or brands of prescription drugs). Even those provisions of the UPDPA that are on their face less related to \"economic interests\" &#8212; e.g., <i>id.</i> &#167; 2699(2)(C) (requiring PBMs to disclose conflicts of interest) &#8212; are aimed at eliminating certain PBM practices that unnecessarily increase the cost of prescription medications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discuss this case, therefore, on the basis that commercial speech is at issue. In <i>Zauderer,</i> the Supreme Court held that \"[b]ecause the extension of First Amendment protection to commercial speech is justified principally by the value to consumers of the information such speech provides,\" a party who was faced with a disclosure requirement had only a minimal interest in withholding the information requested of him by law. <i>Zauderer,</i> 471 U.S. at 651, 105 S.Ct. 2265. The Court also held that the party's rights are adequately protected \"as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these principles here, we find that the UPDPA disclosure provisions do not run afoul of the First Amendment. PCMA's member PBMs only have a minimal interest in withholding the information the UPDPA requires from them, especially given Maine's interest in ensuring that its citizens receive the best and most cost-effective health care possible. The information disclosed under the UPDPA will help the \"covered entities\" that are responsible for paying for medications in Maine ensure that they and their customers are not adversely affected by the abuses and self-dealing of certain PBMs. Furthermore, we think it obvious that the UPDPA's disclosure requirements are \"reasonably related\" to Maine's interest in preventing deception of consumers and increasing public access to prescription drugs. <i>Id.</i> As the district court noted, these disclosure requirements are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">designed to create incentives within the market for the abandonment of certain practices that are likely to unnecessarily increase cost without providing any corresponding benefit to the individual whose prescription is being filled and that appear to be designed merely to improve a drug manufacturer's market share.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Pharm. Care Mgmt. Ass'n,</i> 2005 WL 757608, at 23, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 2339, at *82-83.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PCMA argues that the PBMs' interest in not disclosing, rather than being minimal, is acute. This is because \"the compelled speech takes their valuable property.\" Appellant Reply Br. 28. Aside from the fact that PCMA offers no proof supporting this contention, we have already held that PCMA failed to show that the UPDPA effects a taking of the PBMs' property. We do not see how the situation is any different in the First Amendment context. We think, therefore, that the district court was correct in holding that UPDPA's provisions do not contravene the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. Commerce Clause claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court held that the UPDPA was not in violation of the Commerce Clause. The Commerce Clause provides that Congress shall have the power \"to regulate Commerce . . . among the several States.\" U.S. Const. art. I, &#167; 8, cl. 3. It has long been understood, however, that this affirmative grant of authority to Congress necessarily encompasses a limitation on the power of states to enact legislation that burdens the flow of interstate commerce. This restriction on the states, known as the dormant Commerce Clause, is not absolute and in the absence of conflicting legislation by Congress, \"the States retain authority under their general police powers to regulate matters of legitimate local concern, even though interstate commerce may be affected.\" <i>Maine v. Taylor,</i> 477 U.S. 131, 138, 106 S.Ct. 2440, 91 L.Ed.2d 110 (1986) (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PCMA argues that the UPDPA violates the dormant Commerce Clause on two grounds. First, it claims that the UPDPA has \"extraterritorial reach.\" A state statute is per se invalid under the dormant Commerce Clause when it \"regulates commerce wholly outside the state's borders or when the statute has a practical effect of controlling conduct outside of the state.\" <i>Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs. of Am.,</i> 249 F.3d at 79. A statute has this impermissible extraterritorial reach if it \"necessarily requires out-of-state commerce to be conducted according to in-state terms.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Cotto Waxo Co. v. Williams,</i> 46 F.3d 790, 794 (8th Cir.1995)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court has discussed \"extraterritorial reach\" in a number of cases. PCMA, for example, invokes <i>Edgar v. MITE Corp.,</i> 457 U.S. 624, 640-43, 102 S.Ct. 2629, 73 L.Ed.2d 269 (1982), a case involving an Illinois law that sought to regulate tender offers for the stock of Illinois corporations. The law required that all such offers be registered in advance with the Illinois Secretary of State. Under the terms of the statute, a Delaware corporation soliciting the shares of an Illinois corporation from a resident of Arkansas would be required to register with the state of Illinois. The Supreme Court, however, struck down the statute under the dormant Commerce Clause, noting that the law \"directly regulates transactions which take place across state lines, even if wholly outside the State of Illinois.\" <i>Edgar,</i> 457 U.S. at 641, 102 S.Ct. 2629.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, similarly, discussed <i>Brown-Forman Distillers Corp. v. New York State Liquor Auth.,</i> 476 U.S. 573, 106 S.Ct. 2080, 90 L.Ed.2d 552 (1986). In that case, the Supreme Court invalidated a provision of the New York Alcoholic Beverage Control Law that required liquor distillers and producers doing business in New York to affirm that their prices were no higher than the lowest price at which the same product would be sold in any other state during the month. The Court determined that this was extraterritorial reach violative of the Commerce Clause because during the period that the affirmation was in effect, New York made it illegal, without prior permission from state authorities, for a distiller or producer to reduce its price in other states. Thus, the New York law effectively regulated the price at which liquor was sold in other states. As the Court stated, \"[f]orcing a merchant to seek regulatory approval in one State before undertaking a transaction in another directly regulates interstate commerce.\" <i>Brown-Forman,</i> 476 U.S. at 582, 106 S.Ct. 2080.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PCMA draws here on this idea of \"extraterritorial reach\" and attempts to apply it to the UPDPA. It argues that if a PBM operating outside of Maine enters into a contract outside of Maine with a national insurer similarly operating beyond the state's borders but licensed in the state, the PBM would have to comply with the UPDPA's disclosure requirements. \"This is exactly the sort of extraterritorial reach condemned in <i>Edgar v. MITE Corp.,</i>\" says PCMA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We beg to differ. There is a key difference between the UPDPA and the laws in <i>Edgar</i> and <i>Brown-Forman.</i> In <i>Edgar</i> and <i>Brown-Forman,</i> the state laws at issue gave the state power to determine whether a transaction in another state could occur at all. For example, the law in <i>Edgar</i> gave the Illinois Secretary of State power to determine whether to allow a tender offer by a Delaware corporation for stock held by an Arkansas resident. Similarly, the New York law in <i>Brown-Forman</i> gave the New York State Liquor Authority power to determine whether a liquor distiller or producer would be permitted to reduce its price in other states. It was this sort of \"extraterritorial reach\" that led the Court to invalidate the statutes at issue in those cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The UPDPA, however, does not give Maine any such authority. Under the UPDPA, a transaction outside of Maine between two parties &#8212; for example, between PCMA's hypothetical out-of-state PBM and insurance company &#8212; can take place regardless of whether Maine consents or not. Maine law does not \"regulate . . . [the] out-of-state transaction, either by its express terms or by its inevitable effect.\" <i>Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs. of Am.,</i> 249 F.3d at 81. Maine does not dictate the terms of such a transaction. Nor is Maine in any way \"project[ing] its legislation\" into those other states. <i>Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc.,</i> 294 U.S. 511, 521, 55 S.Ct. 497, 79 L.Ed. 1032 (1935). It simply requires that PBMs, should they choose to do business <i>within</i> Maine, provide \"covered entities\" with certain information about their business relationships. In other words, the UPDPA does not require out-of-state commerce to be conducted according to in-state terms. It requires only that in-state commerce be conducted according to in-state terms. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2699(1)(B), (3) &amp; (5) (2005) (showing that the UPDPA covers only contracts entered in Maine with respect to covered entities in Maine). In light of this distinction, we think that the UPDPA cannot properly be said to have an extraterritorial reach violating the Commerce Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, PCMA argues that the UPDPA violates the Commerce Clause under the more lenient test set out by the Supreme Court in <i>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.,</i> 397 U.S. 137, 90 S.Ct. 844, 25 L.Ed.2d 174 (1970). Under that test &#8212; to be used when the state statute at issue regulates evenhandedly and has only incidental effects on interstate commerce &#8212; courts employ a balancing approach whereby they examine whether the state's interest is legitimate and whether the burden on interstate commerce clearly exceeds the local benefits. <i>Pike,</i> 397 U.S. at 142, 90 S.Ct. 844. Since we have held that the UPDPA is not per se invalid because it does not effect any \"extraterritorial reach,\" and because the Maine statute does regulate evenhandedly and has only incidental effects on interstate commerce, we employ here the <i>Pike</i> balancing test to assess the constitutionality of the UPDPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs. of Am.,</i> we noted that the <i>Pike</i> test involves three separate steps. First, we are to evaluate the nature of the putative local benefits advanced by the statute. Second, we must examine the burden the statute places on interstate commerce. Finally, we are to consider whether the burden is \"clearly excessive\" as compared to the putative local benefits. <i>Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs. of Am.,</i> 249 F.3d at 83-84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The putative local benefits of the UPDPA are clear. The aim of the UPDPA is to reduce the costs of, and increase the public's access to, prescription drugs. The law was designed to deal with \"one of the serious problems of our time.\" <i>Id.</i> at 80. PCMA, for its part, thinks these benefits are not likely to materialize as a result of the UPDPA. It is not the place of this court, however, to pass judgment on the wisdom of the policies adopted by the Maine legislature. <i>See Kassel v. Consol. Freightways Corp.,</i> 450 U.S. 662, 679, 101 S.Ct. 1309, 67 L.Ed.2d 580 (1981) (Brennan, J., concurring) (stating that courts should refrain from attempting to \"second-guess the empirical judgments of lawmakers concerning the utility of legislation\"). Furthermore, as the district court points out, under <i>Pike,</i> it is the <i>putative</i> local benefits that matter. It matters not whether these benefits actually come into being at the end of the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the \"burden\" side of the <i>Pike</i> balancing equation, PCMA only asserts that as a result of the UPDPA, certain PBMs will no longer do business in Maine. PCMA states that \"the extraordinary restrictions imposed [by the UPDPA] on the business operations of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) will make it virtually impossible to establish or maintain a prescription drug program that relies on a for-profit PBM for administrative services.\" In <i>Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs. of Am.,</i> we said that \"[a]rguably, the only burden imposed on interstate commerce by the . . .

It reasoned that since the UPDPA did not run afoul of any of the federal rights raised by PCMA, summary judgment was proper on PCMA's &#167; 1983 claim. PCMA raises this same &#167; 1983 claim on appeal but provides no additional discussion on the matter. Because we also find that the UPDPA is not violative of any federal rights, we think the district court was correct in disposing of this claim on summary judgment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> In addition to its claim that the UPDPA is preempted by ERISA, PCMA argues that the UPDPA is also preempted by FEHBA. FEHBA authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to negotiate contracts with private carriers to provide health benefits for federal employees, retirees, and their dependents. The statute includes an express preemption provision, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 8902(m)(1) (2000), that is nearly identical to ERISA's preemption provision. Therefore, we look to ERISA precedent in determining the scope of the preemption provision under FEHBA<i>See Botsford v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mont., Inc.,</i> 314 F.3d 390, 393-94 (9th Cir.2002) (noting that the FEBHA preemption provision closely resembles ERISA's preemption provision and that \"precedent interpreting the ERISA provision thus provides authority for cases involving the FEHBA provision\"). Because both parties here, as they did before the district court, agree that \"whether the FEHBA preempts the UPDPA depends on essentially the same analysis as the question of whether ERISA preempts the UPDPA,\" we confine our discussion here to examining the scope of the ERISA preemption provision. <i>Pharm.

The Court, however, did resolve the question as to whether a nonfiduciary in such a suit would be subject to monetary damages. <i>See Mertens,</i> 508 U.S. at 253-54, 113 S.Ct. 2063.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> <i>Alessi</i> and <i>Egelhoff</i> are not the only cases in which the Supreme Court has encountered a state law that \"created the prospect that an employer's administrative scheme would be subject to conflicting requirements.\" <i>Fort Halifax,</i> 482 U.S. at 10, 107 S.Ct. 2211. For example, in <i>Shaw,</i> the Court found that two New York laws were preempted by ERISA. One of those laws, New York's Human Rights Law, prohibited \"employers from structuring their employee benefit plans in a way that discriminated on the basis of pregnancy.\" <i>Shaw,</i> 463 U.S. at 97, 103 S.Ct. 2890. The second, New York's Disability Benefits Law, required \"employers to pay employees specific benefits.\" <i>Id.</i> The Court held that these laws were preempted by ERISA because they \"could have been honored only by varying the subjects of a plan's benefits whenever New York law might have applied, or by requiring every plan to provide all beneficiaries with a benefit demanded by New York law.\" <i>Travelers,</i> 514 U.S. at 657, 115 S.Ct. 1671 (discussing the holding in <i>Shaw</i>). Similarly, in <i>FMC Corp. v. Holliday,</i> 498 U.S. 52, 111 S.Ct. 403, 112 L.Ed.2d 356 (1990), the Court discussed a Pennsylvania law that prohibited plans from \"requiring reimbursement [from the beneficiary] in the event of recovery from a third party.\" <i>Id.</i> at 60, 111 S.Ct. 403. The law was likewise preempted by ERISA because the law \"require[d] plan providers to calculate benefit levels in Pennsylvania based on expected liability conditions that differ from those in States that have not enacted similar antisubrogation legislation, [thereby] frustrat[ing] plan administrators' continuing obligation to calculate uniform benefit levels nationwide.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We also note that in<i>Dillingham,</i> the Supreme Court faced a similar situation with apprenticeship programs. Since the Court found that the \"approved apprenticeship programs [in that case] need not necessarily be ERISA plans,\" it refused to find that the California law at issue there \"ma[de] reference to\" ERISA plans. <i>Dillingham,</i> 519 U.S. at 325, 117 S.Ct. 832.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The district court simply assumed that the speech at issue here is \"commercial speech.\" We, however, think that the classification of speech in this case is not at all clear and deserves a full analysis</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> In its reply brief, PCMA states that the holding in<i>Zauderer</i> is \"limited to potentially deceptive advertising directed at consumers.\" Appellant Reply Br. 28.

There is no well developed test in this circuit as to how the third prong of the <i>Hunt</i> test &#8212; whether \"the claim asserted [or] the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in the lawsuit,\" <i>Hunt v. Wash. State Apple Adver. Comm'n,</i> 432 U.S. 333, 343, 97 S.Ct. 2434, 53 L.Ed.2d 383 (1977) &#8212; applies in cases where injunctive relief is sought. This prong of the test is prudential rather than constitutional in nature, <i>United Food &amp; Commercial Workers Union Local 751 v. Brown Group, Inc.,</i> 517 U.S. 544, 555, 116 S.Ct. 1529, 134 L.Ed.2d 758 (1996), and there exists some latitude in case-by-case judgments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That only injunctive relief is sought here distinguishes this case from damages cases; in those, association standing is precluded where the damages turn upon the varying circumstances of the individual plaintiffs. <i>See Warth v. Seldin,</i> 422 U.S. 490, 515-16, 95 S.Ct. 2197, 45 L.Ed.2d 343 (1975). Where only injunctive relief is sought, an association may sometimes be allowed to sue even if some proof from individual non-party members is required; on the other hand, plenty of injunction cases have been dismissed because of the need for individualized proof.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is one decision in this circuit upholding association standing in a case dealing with injunctive relief. <i>Playboy Enters. v. Pub. Svc. Comm'n of P.R.,</i> 906 F.2d 25 (1st Cir.1990), <i>cert. denied,</i> 498 U.S. 959, 111 S.Ct. 388, 112 L.Ed.2d 399 (1990). In that case, however, the impact on individual members necessary for injunctive relief was readily established as to at least one member. Furthermore, the challenged law in <i>Playboy</i> was a statute regulating expression; in such cases, courts are generally more inclined to permit <i>jus tertii</i> claims. <i>See Osediacz v. City of Cranston,</i> 414 F.3d 136, 140 (1st Cir.2005). <i>Playboy</i> is not an open door for association standing in all injunction cases where member circumstances differ and proof of them is important.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sensibly, the Third Circuit in <i>Pennsylvania Psychiatric Society v. Green Spring Health Services, Inc.,</i> 280 F.3d 278 (3d Cir.2002), <i>cert. denied,</i> 537 U.S. 881, 123 S.Ct. 102, 154 L.Ed.2d 138 (2002), did not adopt an all-or-nothing test. The court there stated that it would allow for association standing if proof as to member circumstances were \"limited,\" but it noted that \"conferring associational standing would be improper for claims requiring a fact-intensive-individual inquiry.\" <i>Id.</i> at 286-87. This is not a complete compendium of relevant considerations, but it is a useful start.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, putting to one side their generic weakness, individual takings claims could in principle be significantly strengthened or weakened by the particularized circumstances of each individual member. Furthermore, there appears to be considerable variation in each member company's particular circumstances &#8212; for example, whether a member already discloses the information in question to its customers, the methods by which it stores copies of its contracts, and so on. The district court acted reasonably in concluding that in this case the association should not be allowed to sue as to the takings claim and that individual members should bring their own cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">However, as we are dealing with a matter of prudential standing, the limitation has no Article III implications. Because at least some members could doubtless show that their materials were not disclosed and were well protected, the district court sensibly went on to forestall individual actions that would inevitably follow a dismissal of the association's takings claim on standing grounds. It correctly held that even if association standing were assumed to be adequate, such takings claims fail on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Putting aside a separate threshold concern,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> the Supreme Court in <i>Ruckelshaus v. Monsanto,</i> 467 U.S. 986, 104 S.Ct. 2862, 81 L.Ed.2d 815 (1984), made clear that trade secrets &#8212; as defined by state law &#8212; can constitute property interests for Takings Clause purposes. <i>Id.</i> at 1003-04, 104 S.Ct. 2862. It is far from clear that the Maine courts would find the information required to be disclosed here to represent a trade secret under Maine law. However, as there is no definitive state court judgment on this issue, it is possible that the information sought to be disclosed could potentially represent a valid property interest for Takings Clause purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, even assuming a property interest, the Maine statute does not work a full taking. It does not confiscate the supposed trade secret in the conventional sense; at most, it requires limited disclosure to customers of transactions possibly adverse to the customers' interests, which may reduce the value of the trade secret to the PBM. PBMs may still negotiate rebate contracts with drug companies, but their plan customers may &#8212; as a result of PBMs' disclosures &#8212; look elsewhere for benefits management.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context, a takings claim is far from straightforward. In <i>Penn Central Transportation Co. v. City of New York,</i> 438 U.S. 104, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978), the Supreme Court &#8212; while noting that such analyses are \"essentially ad hoc, factual inquiries\" &#8212; outlined three relevant factors in determining whether a regulation effects a taking: (1) \"the extent to which the regulation [would] interfere[] with distinct investment-backed expectations\"; (2) \"[t]he economic impact of the regulation on the claimant\"; and (3) \"the character of the governmental action.\" <i>Id.</i> at 124, 98 S.Ct. 2646. Given the absence of a full-scale taking and the presence of a traditional regulatory interest, it is enough to defeat the takings claim that no reasonable investment-backed expectation is present at all. <i>See Good v. United States,</i> 189 F.3d 1355, 1363 (Fed.Cir.1999), <i>cert. denied,</i> 529 U.S. 1053, 120 S.Ct. 1554, 146 L.Ed.2d 459 (2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the terms of the statute, the PBMs' disclosure requirements run only to their \"covered entity\" customers and apply only to contracts entered into or renewed after the statute's effective date, namely, September 13, 2003 (three months after the statute was enacted). As the district court noted, PBMs and drug manufacturers typically negotiate their rebate terms on an annual basis. More than two years have elapsed since the statute gave warning of the new regime (in June 2003), so one-year rebate contracts negotiated before that date have expired or have been renewed in the teeth of the statute, and any rebate contracts first entered into after June 2003 would have been made with knowledge of the statute's requirements. There is no basis for forward-looking injunctive relief with respect to rebate contracts entered into after the statute's effective date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even as applied to trade secrets arising before the statute's effective date, the statute would not constitute a taking. \"A manufacturer or vendor has no constitutional right to sell goods without giving to the purchaser fair information of what it is that is being sold.\" <i>Corn Prods. Ref. Co. v. Eddy,</i> 249 U.S. 427, 431, 39 S.Ct. 325, 63 L.Ed. 689 (1919). PBMs should therefore have expected the possibility that they would have to disclose to their covered entity customers information needed to forestall what could reasonably be deemed abusive control. PBMs are undoubtedly aware of the heavily regulated nature of the healthcare industry; in fact, as the district court noted, they are already subject to extensive regulation under federal and state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If PBMs truly assumed that they would be free from disclosure requirements of the sort set forth in the Maine law here, this would be more wishful thinking than reasonable expectation. Whether or not the law strikes the right economic balance between competing producer and consumer interests, it is no more a taking than the requirement that public corporations disclose private corporate information about financial prospects to the public through regular SEC filings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, PCMA's First Amendment claim is completely without merit. So-called \"compelled speech\" may under modern Supreme Court jurisprudence raise a serious First Amendment concern where it effects a forced association between the speaker and a particular viewpoint. <i>See, e.g., Wooley v. Maynard,</i> 430 U.S. 705, 97 S.Ct. 1428, 51 L.Ed.2d 752 (1977) (requiring all New Hampshire drivers to display \"Live Free or Die\" on their license plates); <i>Miami Herald Publ'g Co. v. Tornillo,</i> 418 U.S. 241, 94 S.Ct. 2831, 41 L.Ed.2d 730 (1974) (requiring newspapers to afford political candidates a right to reply to editorial critiques).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What is at stake here, by contrast, is simply routine disclosure of economically significant information designed to forward ordinary regulatory purposes &#8212; in this case, protecting covered entities from questionable PBM business practices. There are literally thousands of similar regulations on the books &#8212; such as product labeling laws, environmental spill reporting, accident reports by common carriers, SEC reporting as to corporate losses and (most obviously) the requirement to file tax returns to government units who use the information to the obvious disadvantage of the taxpayer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The idea that these thousands of routine regulations require an extensive First Amendment analysis is mistaken. <i>Zauderer v. Office of Disciplinary Counsel,</i> 471 U.S. 626, 105 S.Ct. 2265, 85 L.Ed.2d 652 (1985), makes clear \"that an advertiser's rights are adequately protected as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers.\" <i>Id.</i> at 651, 105 S.Ct. 2265. This is a test akin to the general rational basis test governing all government regulations under the Due Process Clause. The test is so obviously met in this case as to make elaboration pointless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> <i>E.g., Ga.

For the reasons hereinafter stated, we affirm the decision of the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Factual Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PCMA is a national trade association of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs). PBMs are major players in the delivery of health care in the United States. They act as middlemen in the lucrative business of providing prescription drugs. They serve as intermediaries between pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmacies on the one hand (as the district court noted, the \"supply\" side of the trade) and health benefit providers (e.g., insurers, self-insured entities, health maintenance organizations, and public and private health plans) on the other (the \"demand\" side). The services that PBMs extend are designed to facilitate the provision of prescription drug benefits to the people who utilize the services of the health benefit providers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For example, PBMs often provide health benefit providers with access to an established network of pharmacies, where customers of the health benefit providers can obtain drugs at certain set prices. PBMs negotiate volume discounts and rebates with drug manufacturers by pooling substantial numbers of health benefit providers. This pooling gives the PBMs tremendous market power to demand concessions from the manufacturers. PBMs also provide drug utilization review services and \"therapeutic interchange programs\" (in other words, substituting a drug for the one actually prescribed by a doctor).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this role as intermediary, however, PBMs have the opportunity to engage in activities that may benefit the drug manufacturers and PBMs financially to the detriment of the health benefit providers. For example, in cases of \"therapeutic interchange,\" a PBM may substitute a more expensive brand name drug for an equally effective and cheaper generic drug. This is done so that the PBM can collect a fee from the manufacturer for helping to increase the manufacturer's market share within a certain drug category. Similarly, a PBM might receive a discount from a manufacturer on a particular drug but not pass any of it on to the health benefit provider, keeping the difference for itself. The health benefit provider, however, often has no idea that a PBM may not be working in its interest. This lack of awareness is the result of the fact that there is little transparency in a PBM's dealings with manufacturers and pharmacies. As the district court noted, \"[w]hether and how a PBM actually saves an individual benefits provider customer money with respect to the purchase of a particular prescription drug is largely a mystery to the benefits provider.\" <i>Pharm.

The UPDPA imposes a number of requirements on those PBMs that choose to enter into contracts in Maine with \"covered entities\" &#8212; meaning health benefit providers and including, in part, insurance companies, the state Medicaid program, and employer health plans. Such PBMs are required to act as fiduciaries for their clients and adhere to certain specific duties. For example, they must disclose conflicts of interest, disgorge profits from self-dealing, and disclose to the covered entities certain of their financial arrangements with third parties. Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167;&#167; 2699(2)(A-G) (2005). The disclosures made by the PBMs to the covered entities are protected by confidentiality. None of the disclosures are available to the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PCMA, on behalf of its member PBMs, challenges the UPDPA on five separate grounds. First, it claims that the Maine law was preempted by either the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (\"ERISA\") or the Federal Employee Health Benefits Act (\"FEHBA\"). PCMA's second argument is that the UPDPA violates the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment because it conditions doing business in Maine upon the forced disclosure or taking of proprietary information. Third, PCMA states that the provisions of the UPDPA violate due process because they provide no pre-deprivation hearing. Fourth, the association claims that the UPDPA disclosure provisions violate the First Amendment by compelling commercial speech in the context of a voluntary business relationship. PCMA's final argument is that the UPDPA violates the Commerce Clause, either through its \"extraterritorial reach\" or by excessively burdening interstate commerce.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the proceedings below, the parties issued cross-motions for summary judgment.

For example, under sections 409 and 502(a)(2) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1109(a), 1132(a)(2), an ERISA fiduciary is personally liable for monetary damages, for restitution, and for \"such other equitable or remedial relief as the court may deem appropriate.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1109(a). A non-fiduciary, however, is not subject to monetary damages in a suit brought under ERISA. <i>See Mertens v.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2063</span></a></span>. The Attorney General argues that since PBMs do not exercise discretionary authority or control in the management and administration of ERISA plans, they are not fiduciaries under the definition provided for under ERISA. PCMA, in contrast, claims that the UPDPA makes PBMs fiduciaries in performing administration activities for ERISA plans. The UPDPA, after all, targets PBMs that contract with \"covered entities\" &#8212; insurance companies, the state Medicaid program, and employer health plans &#8212; some of which may be ERISA plans. The UPDPA requires PBMs to be fiduciaries of the covered entities with which they contract. Therefore, when a PBM contracts with a covered entity that happens to be an ERISA plan, the PBM is a fiduciary of that ERISA plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the UPDPA does impose certain fiduciary duties on the PBMs, these are duties imposed under state law. The key issue here, however, is whether the PBMs are fiduciaries under the definition of a fiduciary provided in ERISA. Our review of the requirements imposed on the PBMs under the UPDPA lead us to believe that the PBMs do not exercise \"discretionary authority or control in the management and administration of the plan.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1002(21)(A). For example, the UPDPA provisions requiring disclosure of conflicts of interest and payments from drug manufacturers are administrative provisions involving no discretion on the part of the PBMs. Such duties are purely ministerial and simply not sufficient for us to find that the PBMs are acting as fiduciaries under ERISA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>2.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With that threshold matter disposed of, we are now able to confront the main issue at hand: Is the UPDPA preempted by ERISA? PCMA claims that ERISA does preempt the UPDPA because ERISA preempts all state laws that \"relate to any ERISA covered employee benefit plan,\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a), regardless of whether an entity is acting as a fiduciary or not. The state, in contrast, argues that the UPDPA is not preempted by ERISA because ERISA only preempts state laws relating to acts performed by ERISA fiduciaries. Since the PBMs regulated by the UPDPA are not fiduciaries under ERISA, there can be no preemption in this instance.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To answer the question of what exactly ERISA preempts, we first turn to the statute itself. ERISA's preemption provision states explicitly that ERISA \"shall supersede any and all State laws insofar as they may now or hereafter relate to any employee benefit plan.\" 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144(a) (2000). Looking only at the face of the statute, then, it appears that PCMA is correct. With its broad and expansive language, the ERISA preemption provision seems to say that all state laws that in any way \"relate to\" any ERISA-covered employee benefit plan are preempted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court, however, has stated that the language of the ERISA preemption provision is not as broad as it seems. The Court has emphasized that the expansive language of the provision is still subject to \"the starting presumption that Congress does not intend to supplant state law\" and has warned \"that, unless congressional intent to preempt clearly appears, ERISA will not be deemed to supplant state law in areas traditionally regulated by the states.\" <i>New York State Conf. of Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield Plans v.

The Court held that the statute was preempted by ERISA because \"[p]lan administrators [could not] make payments simply by identifying the beneficiary specified by the plan documents.

In no way does the UPDPA circumscribe the ability of plan administrators to structure or administer their ERISA plans. As the district court stated, \"[t]he fact that the UPDPA requires PBMs to engage in certain `required practices' in Maine, such as divulging the terms of contracts with pharmaceutical manufacturers and labelers does not restrict the freedom of employee benefit plans to administer or structure their plans in Maine precisely as they would elsewhere.\" <i>Pharm.

We noted that this bond statute differed from the mechanics' lien statute in <i>McCoy</i> in that the \"bond statute makes no direct reference to section 302\" (and hence, no direct reference to ERISA) and in that the language of the bond statute was not at all \"ERISA-specific.\" <i>Id.</i> The relevant language in <i>Williams</i> stood \"at the end of a long list of items,\" most of which had \"nothing whatever to do with ERISA.\" <i>Id.</i> In <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26,</i> we noted that the specific reference to an ERISA plan in <i>McCoy</i> was what gave rise to ERISA preemption. <i>Id.</i> at 142.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We think the UPDPA is similar to the state law at issue in <i>Williams.</i> The existence of ERISA plans is not at all essential to the operation of the UPDPA. The UPDPA applies regardless of whether PBMs are serving ERISA plans. The law applies with respect to a broad spectrum of health care institutions and health benefit providers, including but not limited to ERISA plans. \"Covered entities\" under the UPDPA includes health plans, labor union plans, association plans, insurance companies, HMOs, medical service organizations, and the state Medicaid program.

Such a law would be completely inoperable if the reference to the ERISA plan were omitted. It relied on the reference for its operation. The UPDPA, in contrast, has no such deficiency. Although the UPDPA does operate to regulate PBMs that contract with employee health plans &#8212; some of which may happen to be ERISA plans &#8212; it also operates upon the state Medicaid program and on insurance companies. If the reference to employee health plans was deleted from the text of the UPDPA, the statute would still be operable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> As we have stated previously, \"[a] state law that applies to a wide variety of situations, including an appreciable number that have no specific linkage to ERISA plans, constitutes a law of general application for purposes of 29 U.S.C. &#167; 1144.\" <i>Carpenters Local Union No. 26,</i> 215 F.3d at 144-45 (adding that \"state laws of general application are safe from ERISA preemption\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">c) Alternative enforcement mechanism</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">PCMA, therefore, is unable to show that the UPDPA \"relates to\" an employee benefit plan under either the \"connection with\" or \"reference to\" prongs of the test prescribed by the Supreme Court.

This is a result of the differing circumstances of PCMA's member PBMs. There are certain PBMs that have already disclosed extensive information to their clients, pursuant to contract or in the context of annual audits.

For example, Timothy Wentworth, the group President of National Accounts for Medco, stated that he was not aware of any written security policy prohibiting the removal of client contracts at Medco. Other PBMs keep these client contracts in unlocked cabinets \"in public areas such as hallways.\" Therefore, such information &#8212; at least under Maine law &#8212; cannot be considered a \"trade secret.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given that there are no trade secrets involved with these client contracts, there is no \"property\" subject to the Takings Clause. <i>See Monsanto,</i> 467 U.S. at 1002, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111227\"><a href=\"/opinion/111227/ruckelshaus-v-monsanto-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Hence, many disclosures required from the PBMs under the UPDPA would not be considered unconstitutional takings.

Since there is no taking and no deprivation, it follows that no predeprivation hearing is required.

PCMA claims that the UPDPA violates the First Amendment because it compels PBMs to engage in speech &#8212; in the form of mandated disclosures &#8212; as a condition of doing business in Maine.

Many of the UPDPA's provisions are overtly geared at the economic interests of the PBMs and the covered entities. <i>See, e.g.,</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2699(2)(F) (requiring PBMs to disclose and disgorge any payment or benefit based on volume of sales or classes or brands of prescription drugs). Even those provisions of the UPDPA that are on their face less related to \"economic interests\" &#8212; e.g., <i>id.</i> &#167; 2699(2)(C) (requiring PBMs to disclose conflicts of interest) &#8212; are aimed at eliminating certain PBM practices that unnecessarily increase the cost of prescription medications.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discuss this case, therefore, on the basis that commercial speech is at issue. In <i>Zauderer,</i> the Supreme Court held that \"[b]ecause the extension of First Amendment protection to commercial speech is justified principally by the value to consumers of the information such speech provides,\" a party who was faced with a disclosure requirement had only a minimal interest in withholding the information requested of him by law. <i>Zauderer,</i> 471 U.S. at 651, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111434\"><a href=\"/opinion/111434/zauderer-v-office-of-disciplinary-counsel-of-supreme-court-of-ohio/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Court also held that the party's rights are adequately protected \"as long as disclosure requirements are reasonably related to the State's interest in preventing deception of consumers.\" <i>Id.</i><a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Applying these principles here, we find that the UPDPA disclosure provisions do not run afoul of the First Amendment. PCMA's member PBMs only have a minimal interest in withholding the information the UPDPA requires from them, especially given Maine's interest in ensuring that its citizens receive the best and most cost-effective health care possible. The information disclosed under the UPDPA will help the \"covered entities\" that are responsible for paying for medications in Maine ensure that they and their customers are not adversely affected by the abuses and self-dealing of certain PBMs. Furthermore, we think it obvious that the UPDPA's disclosure requirements are \"reasonably related\" to Maine's interest in preventing deception of consumers and increasing public access to prescription drugs. <i>Id.</i> As the district court noted, these disclosure requirements are</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">designed to create incentives within the market for the abandonment of certain practices that are likely to unnecessarily increase cost without providing any corresponding benefit to the individual whose prescription is being filled and that appear to be designed merely to improve a drug manufacturer's market share.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Pharm.

Under the terms of the statute, a Delaware corporation soliciting the shares of an Illinois corporation from a resident of Arkansas would be required to register with the state of Illinois.

In that case, the Supreme Court invalidated a provision of the New York Alcoholic Beverage Control Law that required liquor distillers and producers doing business in New York to affirm that their prices were no higher than the lowest price at which the same product would be sold in any other state during the month. The Court determined that this was extraterritorial reach violative of the Commerce Clause because during the period that the affirmation was in effect, New York made it illegal, without prior permission from state authorities, for a distiller or producer to reduce its price in other states. Thus, the New York law effectively regulated the price at which liquor was sold in other states. As the Court stated, \"[f]orcing a merchant to seek regulatory approval in one State before undertaking a transaction in another directly regulates interstate commerce.\" <i>Brown-Forman,</i> 476 U.S. at 582, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111683\"><a href=\"/opinion/111683/brown-forman-distillers-corp-v-new-york-state-liquor-authority/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

It argues that if a PBM operating outside of Maine enters into a contract outside of Maine with a national insurer similarly operating beyond the state's borders but licensed in the state, the PBM would have to comply with the UPDPA's disclosure requirements. \"This is exactly the sort of extraterritorial reach condemned in <i>Edgar v. MITE Corp.,</i>\" says PCMA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We beg to differ. There is a key difference between the UPDPA and the laws in <i>Edgar</i> and <i>Brown-Forman.</i> In <i>Edgar</i> and <i>Brown-Forman,</i> the state laws at issue gave the state power to determine whether a transaction in another state could occur at all. For example, the law in <i>Edgar</i> gave the Illinois Secretary of State power to determine whether to allow a tender offer by a Delaware corporation for stock held by an Arkansas resident. Similarly, the New York law in <i>Brown-Forman</i> gave the New York State Liquor Authority power to determine whether a liquor distiller or producer would be permitted to reduce its price in other states. It was this sort of \"extraterritorial reach\" that led the Court to invalidate the statutes at issue in those cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The UPDPA, however, does not give Maine any such authority. Under the UPDPA, a transaction outside of Maine between two parties &#8212; for example, between PCMA's hypothetical out-of-state PBM and insurance company &#8212; can take place regardless of whether Maine consents or not. Maine law does not \"regulate . . . [the] out-of-state transaction, either by its express terms or by its inevitable effect.\" <i>Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs. of Am.,</i> 249 F.3d at 81. Maine does not dictate the terms of such a transaction. Nor is Maine in any way \"project[ing] its legislation\" into those other states. <i>Baldwin v. G.A.F. Seelig, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102402\"><a href=\"/opinion/102402/baldwin-v-gaf-seelig-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 521, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">1032</span></span> (1935). It simply requires that PBMs, should they choose to do business <i>within</i> Maine, provide \"covered entities\" with certain information about their business relationships. In other words, the UPDPA does not require out-of-state commerce to be conducted according to in-state terms. It requires only that in-state commerce be conducted according to in-state terms. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 22, &#167; 2699(1)(B), (3) &amp; (5) (2005) (showing that the UPDPA covers only contracts entered in Maine with respect to covered entities in Maine). In light of this distinction, we think that the UPDPA cannot properly be said to have an extraterritorial reach violating the Commerce Clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alternatively, PCMA argues that the UPDPA violates the Commerce Clause under the more lenient test set out by the Supreme Court in <i>Pike v. Bruce Church, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108085\"><a href=\"/opinion/108085/pike-v-bruce-church-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">397</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108085\"><a href=\"/opinion/108085/pike-v-bruce-church-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Under that test &#8212; to be used when the state statute at issue regulates evenhandedly and has only incidental effects on interstate commerce &#8212; courts employ a balancing approach whereby they examine whether the state's interest is legitimate and whether the burden on interstate commerce clearly exceeds the local benefits. <i>Pike,</i> 397 U.S. at 142, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108085\"><a href=\"/opinion/108085/pike-v-bruce-church-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Since we have held that the UPDPA is not per se invalid because it does not effect any \"extraterritorial reach,\" and because the Maine statute does regulate evenhandedly and has only incidental effects on interstate commerce, we employ here the <i>Pike</i> balancing test to assess the constitutionality of the UPDPA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs. of Am.,</i> we noted that the <i>Pike</i> test involves three separate steps. First, we are to evaluate the nature of the putative local benefits advanced by the statute. Second, we must examine the burden the statute places on interstate commerce. Finally, we are to consider whether the burden is \"clearly excessive\" as compared to the putative local benefits. <i>Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs. of Am.,</i> 249 F.3d at 83-84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The putative local benefits of the UPDPA are clear. The aim of the UPDPA is to reduce the costs of, and increase the public's access to, prescription drugs. The law was designed to deal with \"one of the serious problems of our time.\" <i>Id.</i> at 80. PCMA, for its part, thinks these benefits are not likely to materialize as a result of the UPDPA. It is not the place of this court, however, to pass judgment on the wisdom of the policies adopted by the Maine legislature. <i>See Kassel v. Consol. Freightways Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110439\"><a href=\"/opinion/110439/kassel-v-consolidated-freightways-corp-of-del/\"><span class=\"volume\">450</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">662</span></a></span>, 679, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110439\"><a href=\"/opinion/110439/kassel-v-consolidated-freightways-corp-of-del/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Furthermore, as the district court points out, under <i>Pike,</i> it is the <i>putative</i> local benefits that matter. It matters not whether these benefits actually come into being at the end of the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the \"burden\" side of the <i>Pike</i> balancing equation, PCMA only asserts that as a result of the UPDPA, certain PBMs will no longer do business in Maine. PCMA states that \"the extraordinary restrictions imposed [by the UPDPA] on the business operations of pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) will make it virtually impossible to establish or maintain a prescription drug program that relies on a for-profit PBM for administrative services.\" In <i>Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs. of Am.,</i> we said that \"[a]rguably, the only burden imposed on interstate commerce by the . . . Act [in that case] is its possible effects on the profits of the individual manufacturers.\" <i>Pharm. Research &amp; Mfrs. of Am.,</i> 249 F.3d at 84. We think the same to be true here. However, as we noted in <i>Pharm.

It reasoned that since the UPDPA did not run afoul of any of the federal rights raised by PCMA, summary judgment was proper on PCMA's &#167; 1983 claim. PCMA raises this same &#167; 1983 claim on appeal but provides no additional discussion on the matter.

FEHBA authorizes the Office of Personnel Management to negotiate contracts with private carriers to provide health benefits for federal employees, retirees, and their dependents. The statute includes an express preemption provision, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 8902(m)(1) (2000), that is nearly identical to ERISA's preemption provision. Therefore, we look to ERISA precedent in determining the scope of the preemption provision under FEHBA<i>See Botsford v.

Because both parties here, as they did before the district court, agree that \"whether the FEHBA preempts the UPDPA depends on essentially the same analysis as the question of whether ERISA preempts the UPDPA,\" we confine our discussion here to examining the scope of the ERISA preemption provision. <i>Pharm.

It is far from clear that the Maine courts would find the information required to be disclosed here to represent a trade secret under Maine law. However, as there is no definitive state court judgment on this issue, it is possible that the information sought to be disclosed could potentially represent a valid property interest for Takings Clause purposes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, even assuming a property interest, the Maine statute does not work a full taking. It does not confiscate the supposed trade secret in the conventional sense; at most, it requires limited disclosure to customers of transactions possibly adverse to the customers' interests, which may reduce the value of the trade secret to the PBM. PBMs may still negotiate rebate contracts with drug companies, but their plan customers may &#8212; as a result of PBMs' disclosures &#8212; look elsewhere for benefits management.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this context, a takings claim is far from straightforward.

Given the absence of a full-scale taking and the presence of a traditional regulatory interest, it is enough to defeat the takings claim that no reasonable investment-backed expectation is present at all. <i>See Good v.

As the district court noted, PBMs and drug manufacturers typically negotiate their rebate terms on an annual basis. More than two years have elapsed since the statute gave warning of the new regime (in June 2003), so one-year rebate contracts negotiated before that date have expired or have been renewed in the teeth of the statute, and any rebate contracts first entered into after June 2003 would have been made with knowledge of the statute's requirements. There is no basis for forward-looking injunctive relief with respect to rebate contracts entered into after the statute's effective date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even as applied to trade secrets arising before the statute's effective date, the statute would not constitute a taking. \"A manufacturer or vendor has no constitutional right to sell goods without giving to the purchaser fair information of what it is that is being sold.\" <i>Corn Prods. Ref. Co. v.

Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></span> (1919). PBMs should therefore have expected the possibility that they would have to disclose to their covered entity customers information needed to forestall what could reasonably be deemed abusive control. PBMs are undoubtedly aware of the heavily regulated nature of the healthcare industry; in fact, as the district court noted, they are already subject to extensive regulation under federal and state law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If PBMs truly assumed that they would be free from disclosure requirements of the sort set forth in the Maine law here, this would be more wishful thinking than reasonable expectation. Whether or not the law strikes the right economic balance between competing producer and consumer interests, it is no more a taking than the requirement that public corporations disclose private corporate information about financial prospects to the public through regular SEC filings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Lastly, PCMA's First Amendment claim is completely without merit. So-called \"compelled speech\" may under modern Supreme Court jurisprudence raise a serious First Amendment concern where it effects a forced association between the speaker and a particular viewpoint. <i>See, e.g., Wooley v.
