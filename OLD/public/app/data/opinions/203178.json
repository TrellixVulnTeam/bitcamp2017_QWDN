Plaintiff-appellant Bruce Jackson appeals\n\nfrom the district court's entry of summary judgment in favor of\n\ndefendants, denying his claims, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983, that\n\nhis termination from employment as a tenured professor at the\n\nMassachusetts Bay Community college (\"MBCC\") violated his due\n\nprocess     and   equal   protection           rights.    Jackson,     following\n\narbitration, has been reinstated to his former position with MBCC,\n\nawarded back pay and benefits for the time that he was off the\n\npayroll,    and   reimbursed      for    medical     expenses   incurred.      He\n\ncontinued to pursue the present claims in an effort to obtain\n\ndamages and attorneys' fees.\n\n            \"We review de novo a district court's entry of summary\n\njudgment.    Like the district court we take the facts of record in\n\nthe light most favorable to the nonmovant . . . and draw all\n\nreasonable     inferences    in    his     favor.        Summary    judgment   is\n\nappropriate only when the record 'show[s] that there is no genuine\n\nissue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.' Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).\" Cash v. Cycle\n\nCraft Co., 508 F.3d 680, 682 (1st Cir. 2007).                       In opposing\n\ndefendants' motion for summary judgment and in support of his\n\ncross-motion for summary judgment, Jackson relied largely upon the\n\narbitrator's      findings   in    the    Arbitration     Opinion    and   Award.\n\n\"Although the arbitrator's factual findings are not dispositive,\n\nthey may be entitled to great weight.\" Wojcik v. Massachusetts\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fState Lottery Comm'n, 300 F.3d 92, 105 (1st Cir. 2002) (citing\n\nMcDonald v. City of W. Branch, 466 U.S. 284, 292 n.13 (1984)).\n\n           I. Procedural Due Process\n\n           At the pre-termination stage, due process requires that\n\n\"[t]he tenured public employee [receive] oral or written notice of\n\nthe charges against him, an explanation of the employer's evidence,\n\nand an opportunity to present his side of the story.\" Cleveland Bd.\n\nof Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532, 546(1985). Jackson argues on\n\nappeal that the district court erred in entering summary judgment\n\nin favor of defendants on his due process claim because his pre-\n\ntermination hearing was not held before an \"impartial\" hearing\n\nofficer,   and   because   he   did   not   receive   the   requisite   pre-\n\ntermination notice that the charges against him might result in his\n\ndismissal.   Neither argument has merit.\n\n           A. Impartial Hearing Officer\n\n           \"We have held that there is no requirement that the\n\nhearing officer be impartial; indeed, the terminating employer may\n\npreside. . . . But that impartiality is not demanded does not\n\nitself determine whether bias can be so severe as to interfere with\n\ndue process at the hearing itself.\" Chmielinski v. Massachusetts,\n\n___ F.3d ___, 2008 WL 171099, at *7 (1st Cir. Jan. 22, 2008).            To\n\ndemonstrate such a due process violation, however, the plaintiff\n\nwould have to show that the alleged bias \"deprived him of the\n\nopportunity to put his facts before the decisionmaker, or that\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthere was an[] error of primary facts in the grounds used for\n\ntermination that could be explained only by bias.\" Id.\n\n            As the district court found, and the record supports,\n\nJackson \"had the opportunity to present testimony and cross-examine\n\nwitnesses\" at his pre-termination hearing. And the record does not\n\nreveal erroneous factual findings at the pre-termination stage that\n\ncould be explained only by bias. Although the arbitrator concluded\n\nthat there was not just cause to dismiss Jackson, she did not find\n\nthat the charges were without any factual basis.              Instead, the\n\narbitrator's conclusion of no \"just cause\" was largely based on her\n\nfinding that MBCC had not put Jackson on notice in the years\n\nleading up to his dismissal that the underlying conduct charged was\n\ninappropriate    and,   if   continued,     could   result   in   dismissal.\n\nMoreover,   as   in   Chmielinski,    the   post-termination      procedures\n\n(arbitration) provided an adequate means for Jackson to complain\n\nabout the decisionmaker's alleged bias. See id. at *7 n.6.\n\n            B. Pre-Termination Notice\n\n            Appellant argues that he did not receive the notice\n\nrequired by the due process clause, relying upon this court's\n\ndecision in Cotnoir v. Univ. of Me. Sys., 35 F.3d 6 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).   Cotnoir held that under Loudermill, pre-termination notice\n\nmust include \"notice of the charges alleged against [the employee]\n\nand any proposed action the official intends to take, based on\n\nthose charges.\" Id. at 11.      The record, viewed in the light most\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\ffavorable to Jackson, establishes that he received the requisite\n\nnotice. Jackson was dismissed on August 8, 2002, after a three-day\n\nevidentiary hearing.         In the spring prior to his dismissal, he\n\nreceived two letters notifying him of the charges against him and\n\nthe possibility that he would be dismissed.              The complaint itself\n\nstates that \"[i]n the spring of 2002, Dr. Norman apprised Dr.\n\nJackson of his intention to terminate his employment.\" And the\n\nArbitration Opinion and Award found that \"[b]y letter dated June\n\n28,   2002,    President    Norman   notified     Dr.   Jackson   that   he   was\n\nrecommending Dr. Jackson's dismissal based on the following charges\n\n[followed by a listing of the charges].\"\n\n              To the extent that Jackson relies upon the arbitrator's\n\nfindings to establish that the requisite notice was not provided,\n\nthat reliance is misplaced.          The arbitrator found that the notice\n\nof what was expected of Jackson as a Professor in the years leading\n\nup to his dismissal was inadequate, weakening MBCC's argument that\n\nthere was just cause for dismissal. The element of notice required\n\nto establish \"just cause\" for termination is an entirely separate\n\nstandard from the requirement of pre-termination notice under the\n\ndue process clause.         The arbitrator was not presented with the\n\nquestion,     and   did    not   decide,     whether    Jackson   received    the\n\nrequisite notice under the due process clause that he might face\n\ntermination for the charged conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f               II. Equal Protection \"Class of One\"\n\n               An equal protection \"class of one\" claim \"is cognizable\n\nwhen - and only when - a 'plaintiff alleges that she has been\n\nintentionally treated differently from others similarly situated\n\nand    that    there     is      no   rational    basis     for    the    difference   in\n\ntreatment.'         At     the    summary   judgment      stage,     of    course,   this\n\nallegation must be backed by competent evidence.\" Cordi-Allen v.\n\nConlon, 494 F.3d 245, 250 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting Village of\n\nWillowbrook v. Olech, 528 U.S. 562, 564 (2000)(per curiam)). In an\n\nattempt       to   carry      that    burden,     Jackson    has    identified       three\n\nincidents of complaints against MBCC professors that allegedly were\n\nnot treated in the same manner as the student complaint against\n\nhim.    Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Jackson,\n\nthe record does not support a finding that there was the requisite\n\ndegree of similarity between Jackson's circumstances and those of\n\nthe other MBCC instructors to whom he seeks to compare himself.\n\n               Appellant also appeals from the district court's denial\n\nof 1) his motion for default judgment and 2) his motion for\n\ndisqualification of defendants' counsel, the Massachusetts Attorney\n\nGeneral's Office.          Neither claim has merit.\n\n               In their motion to allow a late filing of their answer,\n\nnunc   pro     tunc,     defendants      claimed     that    there       was   \"excusable\n\nneglect\" under Rule 6(b) because \"due to the absence of a pertinent\n\nentry in the office's case management system, undersigned counsel\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fmissed the deadline to file an answer and filed it upon discovering\n\nthe error.\"     \"The district court is afforded great leeway in\n\ngranting or refusing enlargements . . . and its decisions are\n\nreviewable only for abuse of that discretion.\" Maldonado-Denis v.\n\nCastillo-Rodriguez, 23 F.3d 576, 583-84 (1st Cir. 1994).               \"The\n\nSupreme Court has held that the term 'excusable neglect' should be\n\ninterpreted flexibly. See Pioneer Inv. Servs. Co. v. Brunswick\n\nAssocs. Ltd. P'ship, 507 U.S. 380, 389 (1993).\" Benitez-Garcia v.\n\nGonzalez-Vega, 468 F.3d 1, 6 n.8 (1st Cir. 2006).          And this court\n\nhas said that \"'[a] default judgment is itself a drastic sanction\n\nthat should be employed only in an extreme situation.'\" Coyante v.\n\nP.R. Ports Auth., 105 F.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 1997).        For the reasons\n\nstated in defendants' motion to allow a late filing and opposition\n\nto the motion for default judgment, the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in determining that this was not such a\n\nsituation.\n\n           Appellant's    claim   that   the   district   court    erred   in\n\ndenying   his   motion   to   disqualify   the   Massachusetts     Attorney\n\nGeneral's Office from representing the defendants is              frivolous.\n\nIn his opposition to appellees' motion for summary disposition,\n\nJackson accepts that the Attorney General's Office has authority to\n\nrepresent the defendants.       He maintains that \"the issue here is\n\nwhether the statutory procedures were followed.\"           The procedures\n\nwhich Jackson claims were violated are contained in M.G.L. ch. 12\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fยง3E, which applies to actions against \"an officer or employee of\n\nany agency within the executive office of health and human services\n\nor the department of education.\" Id. ยง 3E.   As the appellees have\n\npointed out, and appellant has not disputed, the MBCC is not an\n\nagency within either of the named departments.      Therefore, the\n\nstatutory procedure that Jackson claims was not followed does not\n\napply to the Attorney General's representation of these defendants.\n\n          Appellees' motion for summary disposition is granted and\n\nthe district court's judgment granting their motion for summary\n\njudgment is affirmed. See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f",

The arbitrator was not presented with the\n\nquestion,     and   did    not   decide,     whether    Jackson   received    the\n\nrequisite notice under the due process clause that he might face\n\ntermination for the charged conduct.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f               II.

In an\n\nattempt       to   carry      that    burden,     Jackson    has    identified       three\n\nincidents of complaints against MBCC professors that allegedly were\n\nnot treated in the same manner as the student complaint against\n\nhim.    Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Jackson,\n\nthe record does not support a finding that there was the requisite\n\ndegree of similarity between Jackson's circumstances and those of\n\nthe other MBCC instructors to whom he seeks to compare himself.\n\n               Appellant also appeals from the district court's denial\n\nof 1) his motion for default judgment and 2) his motion for\n\ndisqualification of defendants' counsel, the Massachusetts Attorney\n\nGeneral's Office.          Neither claim has merit.\n\n               In their motion to allow a late filing of their answer,\n\nnunc   pro     tunc,     defendants      claimed     that    there       was   \"excusable\n\nneglect\" under Rule 6(b) because \"due to the absence of a pertinent\n\nentry in the office's case management system, undersigned counsel\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fmissed the deadline to file an answer and filed it upon discovering\n\nthe error.\"     \"The district court is afforded great leeway in\n\ngranting or refusing enlargements . . . and its decisions are\n\nreviewable only for abuse of that discretion.\" Maldonado-Denis v.\n\nCastillo-Rodriguez, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195359\"><a href=\"/opinion/195359/denis-v-rodriquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">576</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 583-84 (1st Cir. 1994).               \"The\n\nSupreme Court has held that the term 'excusable neglect' should be\n\ninterpreted flexibly.

For the reasons\n\nstated in defendants' motion to allow a late filing and opposition\n\nto the motion for default judgment, the district court did not\n\nabuse its discretion in determining that this was not such a\n\nsituation.\n\n           Appellant's    claim   that   the   district   court    erred   in\n\ndenying   his   motion   to   disqualify   the   Massachusetts     Attorney\n\nGeneral's Office from representing the defendants is              frivolous.\n\nIn his opposition to appellees' motion for summary disposition,\n\nJackson accepts that the Attorney General's Office has authority to\n\nrepresent the defendants.       He maintains that \"the issue here is\n\nwhether the statutory procedures were followed.\"           The procedures\n\nwhich Jackson claims were violated are contained in M.G.L. ch. 12\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fยง3E, which applies to actions against \"an officer or employee of\n\nany agency within the executive office of health and human services\n\nor the department of education.\" Id. ยง 3E.   As the appellees have\n\npointed out, and appellant has not disputed, the MBCC is not an\n\nagency within either of the named departments.      Therefore, the\n\nstatutory procedure that Jackson claims was not followed does not\n\napply to the Attorney General's representation of these defendants.\n\n          Appellees' motion for summary disposition is granted and\n\nthe district court's judgment granting their motion for summary\n\njudgment is affirmed. See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f</pre>",
