Rosaura       González-Rucci\n\n(\"González\"), an immigration lawyer, claims to have rejected the\n\namorous advances of an Immigration and Naturalization Service\n\n(\"INS\")      officer.       Thereafter,       the    U.S.     Attorney's      Office\n\ninvestigated her on suspicion that she aided and abetted aliens\n\nentering into sham marriages for immigration purposes; she was\n\nindicted and acquitted. González then brought several Federal Tort\n\nClaims Act (\"FTCA\") claims -- including malicious prosecution and\n\nabuse of process -- against the INS1 and a number of its officers\n\n(collectively, \"Defendants\").              González's theory was that the\n\nanimosity generated by her rejection of the INS officer prompted\n\nthe   U.S.    Attorney's     Office     to    seek    a     sham    indictment   in\n\nretaliation.      After a bench trial, the district court dismissed\n\nGonzález's claims, a result she now appeals. After careful review,\n\nwe affirm.\n\n                               I.     Background\n\n             As this case comes to us following a bench trial, we\n\nrecount   the    relevant    facts    as     found   by     the    district   court,\n\nconsistent with record support.              Able Sales Co. v. Compañía de\n\nAzúcar de P.R., 406 F.3d 56, 59 (1st Cir. 2005); Bolduc v. United\n\nStates, 402 F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir. 2005); see also González-Rucci v.\n\n\n\n1\n   In 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were transferred to\nthe Immigration and Customs Enforcement Section of the Department\nof Homeland Security, named as a successor to the former as a\ndefendant in this case.\n\n                                       -2-\n\fU.S. Immigration & Naturalization Serv., 460 F. Supp. 2d 307, 310-\n\n12 (D.P.R. 2006) (\"González-Rucci II\") (district court's factual\n\nfindings).\n\n           González     represented   clients      in   cases   before   the\n\nimmigration authorities in San Juan, Puerto Rico.           She befriended\n\nan immigration officer named Andrés Núñez, but the two later fell\n\nout when she rejected his romantic overtures.2             Thereafter, she\n\nbegan to be treated less favorably at the San Juan INS office.           For\n\nexample, she was made to wait many hours to file documents, was\n\nreprimanded for using a routing slip normally prepared by INS\n\nofficials, was not sent timely notifications of her appointments\n\nwith immigration officers, causing her to miss meetings, and was\n\npunished with suspension for failing to follow proper procedures in\n\nstamping   documents.      She   filed   several    complaints    with   INS\n\noversight officers complaining of this treatment, but no action was\n\ntaken.\n\n           In the meantime, then-INS Special Agent Luis Reyes was\n\ninvestigating sham marriages involving Dominican aliens.            Reyes's\n\nsupervisor, Roberto Ramos, was a friend of Núñez's and often ate\n\nlunch with him.       Reyes's investigation led him to suspect that\n\n\n2\n   According to González's testimony, at a certain point in their\nfriendship Núñez asked her to go out dancing, and she told him that\nshe already had a boyfriend, that she thought such an activity\ninappropriate   because   she   and  Núñez   had   a   professional\nrelationship, and that in any event Núñez was not her type.\nGonzález testified that, from this point onward, Núñez was\nexceedingly spiteful toward her in all their dealings.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fGonzález was aiding and abetting U.S. citizens and undocumented\n\nDominican aliens to enter into sham marriages so that the latter\n\ncould avoid deportation or obtain other marriage benefits, and that\n\nshe had prepared coaching questions to help them lie to the INS.\n\nReyes presented his findings to the U.S. Attorney's Office, which\n\nobtained and executed search warrants on González's home and office\n\nand seized a number of documents.           Among the seized documents was\n\nwhat the parties call the \"coaching questionnaire,\" in which\n\nGonzález advised clients as follows:\n\n           Be careful with medical plans and credit\n           cards, or purchasing cards for any store such\n           as Sears, Sam[']s, J.C. Penney's, Pitusa, etc.\n           If your spouse is not on that card as a\n           beneficiary or user, do not take it to\n           Immigration on the day of the interview, DO\n           NOT say you have it, it is better to say that\n           you do not have a medical plan, nor any credit\n           card at all, there is no way the Immigration\n           Service could know this.\n\nA grand jury indicted González and two others for conspiracy to\n\ndefraud the INS and other crimes, but the district court entered\n\njudgment of acquittal for González at the close of evidence.\n\n           González then sued the Defendants under the FTCA, 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1346(b), and Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of the\n\nFederal   Bureau   of    Narcotics,    403    U.S.   388   (1971),   alleging\n\nmalicious prosecution and abuse of process.3               Specifically, she\n\naverred   that   Núñez   and   his    colleagues     improperly   used   their\n\n\n3\n   González originally made two other claims that she did not\nultimately pursue below and that are not at issue on appeal.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fofficial positions to destroy her law practice, to obtain the\n\nsearch    warrants,   to   procure   her   arrest,     and   to     secure   her\n\nindictment.\n\n            The district court dismissed the Bivens claims for lack\n\nof   subject-matter     jurisdiction    under    Federal     Rule    of   Civil\n\nProcedure 12(b)(1) because they were untimely; it dismissed the\n\nmalicious prosecution and abuse of process claims under Federal\n\nRule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) because they failed to state a\n\nclaim on which relief could be granted.         On appeal, we affirmed the\n\ndismissal of the Bivens claims, González-Rucci v. U.S. Immigration\n\n& Naturalization Serv., 405 F.3d 45, 48 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"González-\n\nRucci I\"), but reversed the dismissal of the malicious prosecution\n\nand abuse of process claims, holding that they were viable.                  Id.\n\nat 49-50.\n\n            On remand, the district court held a two-day bench trial.\n\nOnly two witnesses testified:        González, for herself, and Reyes,\n\nfor the defense.      Where relevant to the issues in this appeal, we\n\ndiscuss    their   testimony   below.      At    the   end    of    González's\n\npresentation of evidence, the Defendants moved for judgment on\n\npartial findings under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52(c); the\n\ncourt reserved judgment on the motion.          When trial concluded, the\n\ncourt dismissed the malicious prosecution and abuse of process\n\nclaims because González had failed to present sufficient credible\n\nevidence to sustain them.      See generally González-Rucci II, 460 F.\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fSupp. 2d at 307.      We discuss the court's reasoning below.        González\n\nnow appeals, asserting that the evidence was sufficient to support\n\nboth claims.\n\n                              II.    Discussion\n\n            A.   Standard of Review\n\n            Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 52 governs our review of\n\na   trial   court's    findings     of    fact   following   a   bench   trial:\n\n\"Findings of fact, whether based on oral or other evidence, must\n\nnot be set aside unless clearly erroneous, and the reviewing court\n\nmust give due regard to the trial court's opportunity to judge the\n\nwitnesses' credibility.\"       Fed. R. Civ. P. 52(a)(6).         We will deem\n\na finding clearly erroneous only if, viewing the record in its\n\nentirety, we are left with a \"'strong, unyielding belief that a\n\nmistake has been made.'\"       United States v. Jones, 523 F.3d 31, 36\n\n(1st Cir. 2008) (quoting C.G. ex rel. A.S. v. Five Town Cmty. Sch.\n\nDist., 513 F.3d 279, 285 (1st Cir. 2008)); accord Carr v. PMS\n\nFishing Corp., 191 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1999) (describing this\n\nstandard of review as \"forbidding\" because it requires that the\n\nreviewing court have \"an abiding conviction that the factfinder\n\nstumbled badly\"). We accord plenary review to the district court's\n\nconclusions of law following a bench trial.            See Anderson ex rel.\n\nDowd v. City of Boston, 375 F.3d 71, 80 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f           B.   Malicious Prosecution Claim\n\n           In an FTCA case such as this one, we glean the applicable\n\nsubstantive law from the state (or commonwealth) where the alleged\n\ntort occurred -- here, Puerto Rico. Mitchell v. United States, 141\n\nF.3d 8, 13 (1st Cir. 1998).     A malicious prosecution claim under\n\nPuerto Rico law has four elements:        (1) the defendant instituted a\n\ncriminal   action   against   the   plaintiff;    (2)    the   action   was\n\nterminated in favor of the plaintiff; (3) the defendant acted with\n\nmalice and without probable cause; and (4) the plaintiff suffered\n\ndamages.    González-Rucci I, 405 F.3d at 49 (citing Nogueras-\n\nCartagena v. United States, 172 F. Supp. 2d 296, 315 (D.P.R.\n\n2001)).\n\n           The Defendants do not dispute that González established\n\nthe first two elements of her malicious prosecution claim, nor do\n\nthey seem seriously to dispute the fourth.              They do, however,\n\nchallenge the existence of the third element:        whether some or all\n\nof them acted with malice and pursued González's indictment without\n\nprobable cause.     González argues that the evidence presented at\n\ntrial established this element.       She testified about how she was\n\nsingled out for harassment at the San Juan INS office following her\n\nrejection of Núñez.   She also testified that none of the Dominican\n\naliens the U.S. Attorney's office alleged to be her clients were,\n\nin fact, her clients.     According to González, Reyes thus had no\n\nbasis to conclude that she took part in a scheme to coach these\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fpersons    to   enter   into    sham   marriages,    and   he     had   no   basis\n\nsubsequently to seek her indictment.             González argued before the\n\ndistrict court, and reiterates to us, that the extreme animosity\n\ndemonstrated toward her at the San Juan INS office, combined with\n\nReyes's    lack   of    any    genuine    justification     for     seeking   her\n\nindictment and his supervisor Ramos's frequent lunches with Núñez,\n\npermits the reasonable inference that Reyes and the prosecutors who\n\nacted on his findings were motivated by malice in pursuing her\n\nprosecution.\n\n            The district court was unpersuaded by this theory and\n\nfound, on its assessment of the testimony of González and Reyes and\n\nother evidence, that González had not satisfied the third element\n\nof her malicious prosecution claim.            Specifically, the court found\n\nthat she had failed to prove any link between Reyes's investigation\n\nand actions by Núñez or other relevant INS officers who may have\n\nhad a vendetta against her, and that Ramos and Núñez's lunches\n\ntogether did not establish such a link.              On the other hand, the\n\ncourt credited Reyes's testimony that, before seeking González's\n\nindictment, he interviewed several persons suspected of entering\n\ninto sham marriages, and that these persons implicated González in\n\ncoaching them to circumvent the immigration laws.                       The court\n\nbelieved    Reyes's     assertion      that    it   was    this     information,\n\nsubsequently provided by Reyes to the U.S. Attorney's Office, that\n\nled the latter to apply for the search warrants.                  The court then\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\ffound that the evidence gathered in these searches -- especially\n\nthe coaching questionnaire4 -- established adequate probable cause\n\nfor   believing   González   had   committed   a   crime   (a   conclusion\n\nindependently reached by the magistrate who issued the search\n\nwarrants, the different magistrate who issued the arrest warrant,\n\nand the members of the grand jury).      See González-Rucci II, 460 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 313.\n\n           Our review of the record reveals ample support for the\n\ncourt's factual findings.     Reyes testified that he interviewed a\n\nnumber of Dominican aliens or their U.S. citizen spouses, and that\n\nthese persons described advice González gave them on various\n\naspects of entering into and maintaining sham marriages -- such as,\n\nfor example, registering a child fathered by a Dominican as having\n\nbeen fathered by a U.S. citizen husband, or divorcing a Dominican\n\nhusband and remarrying an American one to avoid deportation. Reyes\n\nalso testified that, although he and Núñez both worked at the INS,\n\nthey were not personal friends, and he did not recall Núñez ever\n\ndiscussing any aspect of González's case with him or forwarding him\n\nany information about her.    Reyes testified repeatedly and without\n\nequivocation that no one -- not Núñez, Ramos, or any other INS\n\nofficer -- directed him to seek out information that could be used\n\nagainst González, or to harass her in any way.\n\n\n4\n   With respect to the coaching questionnaire, the court remarked\nthat it \"certainly dissipate[d] any doubt concerning the legitimacy\nof the criminal charges leveled against plaintiff.\"\n\n                                   -9-\n\f            The district court, as the trier of fact, was entitled to\n\ncredit   Reyes's   testimony   as   a   true   account   of   what    actually\n\nhappened.   See Carr, 191 F.3d at 7 (\"We have said with a regularity\n\nbordering on the monotonous that, in a bench trial, credibility\n\ncalls are for the trier . . . .\") (citations omitted).               While the\n\ntestimony is not without a few minor inconsistencies -- seemingly\n\ndue in large part to Reyes's inability to remember certain details\n\nabout events that transpired more than ten years prior -- none of\n\nthese is anywhere near serious enough to render the district\n\ncourt's credibility assessment an abuse of discretion.           Cf., e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Jones, 187 F.3d 210, 214-16 (1st Cir. 1999) (no\n\nclear error in crediting witnesses' testimony from suppression\n\nhearing despite several minor inconsistencies); Gallo Motor Ctr.,\n\nInc. v. Mazda Motor of Am., Inc., 347 F.3d 20, 28-29 (1st Cir.\n\n2003) (similar).\n\n            Furthermore, we find nothing in the record that would\n\nlead us to disturb the district court's conclusion that González\n\nfailed to connect Núñez (or other INS colleagues that may have\n\nborne animosity towards her) with Reyes and his investigation,\n\nthrough Ramos or otherwise.         Unlike a decision on a motion for\n\nsummary judgment, after a bench trial the district court is not\n\nobliged to believe the nonmovant's sworn version of the facts, see,\n\ne.g., Velázquez-García v. Horizon Lines of P.R., Inc., 473 F.3d 11,\n\n18 (1st Cir. 2007), or to draw inferences in her favor, see, e.g.,\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fFranceschi v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs, 514 F.3d 81, 84 (1st\n\nCir. 2008).     Instead, the court is free to disregard a party's\n\ndesired inference in favor of a competing inference, provided the\n\nlatter is plausible.          See Torres-Lazarini v. United States, 523\n\nF.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir. 2008) (court's choice between \"plausible but\n\ncompeting inferences\" from evidence presented at bench trial cannot\n\nbe clearly erroneous) (citing Cape Fear, Inc. v. Martin, 312 F.3d\n\n496, 500 (1st Cir. 2002)).          The court here determined that, on the\n\nbasis of Reyes's findings reached in good faith, Reyes and the\n\nprosecutors    who    acted    on   the   findings     in   seeking       González's\n\nindictment    did    so   properly.       We   think   this   was     a   plausible\n\ninference drawn from Reyes's testimony which, as noted above, the\n\ndistrict court correctly credited.\n\n          Accepting, then, the facts the district court found to\n\nhave been proven and the reasonable inferences drawn by the court,\n\nwe find no infirmity in its application of the law.                   Puerto Rico\n\nlaw requires both malice and action without probable cause to\n\nsustain a malicious prosecution claim, González-Rucci I, 405 F.3d\n\nat 49, and the court's factual findings plainly reveal that neither\n\nwas present in these circumstances.              We accordingly affirm the\n\ndismissal of this claim, and proceed to González's challenge to the\n\ndismissal of the abuse of process claim.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f              C.   Abuse of Process Claim\n\n              A plaintiff must prove two elements to make out a claim\n\nfor abuse of process under Puerto Rico law:       (1) that the defendant\n\nhad a bad motive; and (2) that it used the legal process for an\n\nimproper, collateral objective.       González-Rucci I, 405 F.3d at 49\n\n(quoting Microsoft Corp. v. Computer Warehouse, 83 F. Supp. 2d 256,\n\n261 (D.P.R. 2000)).       In contrast to malicious prosecution claims,\n\nwhich \"are generally directed to a legal action as a whole,\" abuse\n\nof process claims \"typically cover[] challenges to the legal\n\naction's procedural components,\" such as subpoenas or discovery\n\nmechanisms.        Id. (citing Nogueras-Cartagena, 172 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n316).\n\n              The district court found that González \"did not meet her\n\nburden   of    showing   any   procedural   component   of   her   criminal\n\nprosecution was influenced by a bad motive, or conducted with the\n\npurpose of attaining an improper collateral objective,\" for two\n\nreasons.      González-Rucci II, 460 F. Supp. 2d at 314.       First, she\n\nfailed to put forth any evidence to show that Reyes or the\n\nprosecutors obtained her indictment by presenting knowingly false\n\ntestimony to the grand jury.      Second, she failed to prove that any\n\naspect of Reyes's investigation was at all related to her rejection\n\nof Núñez -- and thus potentially tainted by the latter's alleged\n\nresentment.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f              What we have said above allows us easily to dispose of\n\nthis ground of appeal.           The district court was well within its\n\ndiscretion in determining that Reyes's investigation, and the\n\nactions of the U.S. Attorney's Office in response to Reyes's\n\nfindings, were performed in good faith and were not influenced by\n\nNúñez or anyone else at the INS office hostile to González.\n\nWithout this link, the record does not show the requisite bad\n\nmotive   on    the   part   of    Reyes   or   the   prosecutors   who   sought\n\nsubpoenas, undertook discovery, and participated in the other\n\nprocedural aspects of González's criminal case.             As such, we must\n\nalso affirm the dismissal of González's abuse of process claim.\n\n                                 III.   Conclusion\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the dismissal of\n\nGonzález's claims in all respects.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\f",

Rosaura       González-Rucci\n\n(\"González\"), an immigration lawyer, claims to have rejected the\n\namorous advances of an Immigration and Naturalization Service\n\n(\"INS\")      officer.       Thereafter,       the    U.S.     Attorney's      Office\n\ninvestigated her on suspicion that she aided and abetted aliens\n\nentering into sham marriages for immigration purposes; she was\n\nindicted and acquitted. González then brought several Federal Tort\n\nClaims Act (\"FTCA\") claims -- including malicious prosecution and\n\nabuse of process -- against the INS1 and a number of its officers\n\n(collectively, \"Defendants\").              González's theory was that the\n\nanimosity generated by her rejection of the INS officer prompted\n\nthe   U.S.    Attorney's     Office     to    seek    a     sham    indictment   in\n\nretaliation.

She befriended\n\nan immigration officer named Andrés Núñez, but the two later fell\n\nout when she rejected his romantic overtures.2             Thereafter, she\n\nbegan to be treated less favorably at the San Juan INS office.           For\n\nexample, she was made to wait many hours to file documents, was\n\nreprimanded for using a routing slip normally prepared by INS\n\nofficials, was not sent timely notifications of her appointments\n\nwith immigration officers, causing her to miss meetings, and was\n\npunished with suspension for failing to follow proper procedures in\n\nstamping   documents.      She   filed   several    complaints    with   INS\n\noversight officers complaining of this treatment, but no action was\n\ntaken.\n\n           In the meantime, then-INS Special Agent Luis Reyes was\n\ninvestigating sham marriages involving Dominican aliens.            Reyes's\n\nsupervisor, Roberto Ramos, was a friend of Núñez's and often ate\n\nlunch with him.       Reyes's investigation led him to suspect that\n\n\n2\n   According to González's testimony, at a certain point in their\nfriendship Núñez asked her to go out dancing, and she told him that\nshe already had a boyfriend, that she thought such an activity\ninappropriate   because   she   and  Núñez   had   a   professional\nrelationship, and that in any event Núñez was not her type.\nGonzález testified that, from this point onward, Núñez was\nexceedingly spiteful toward her in all their dealings.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fGonzález was aiding and abetting U.S. citizens and undocumented\n\nDominican aliens to enter into sham marriages so that the latter\n\ncould avoid deportation or obtain other marriage benefits, and that\n\nshe had prepared coaching questions to help them lie to the INS.\n\nReyes presented his findings to the U.S. Attorney's Office, which\n\nobtained and executed search warrants on González's home and office\n\nand seized a number of documents.           Among the seized documents was\n\nwhat the parties call the \"coaching questionnaire,\" in which\n\nGonzález advised clients as follows:\n\n           Be careful with medical plans and credit\n           cards, or purchasing cards for any store such\n           as Sears, Sam[']s, J.C.

A malicious prosecution claim under\n\nPuerto Rico law has four elements:        (1) the defendant instituted a\n\ncriminal   action   against   the   plaintiff;    (2)    the   action   was\n\nterminated in favor of the plaintiff; (3) the defendant acted with\n\nmalice and without probable cause; and (4) the plaintiff suffered\n\ndamages.    González-Rucci I, 405 F.3d at 49 (citing Nogueras-\n\nCartagena v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2309104\"><a href=\"/opinion/2309104/nogueras-cartagena-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 315 (D.P.R.\n\n2001)).\n\n           The Defendants do not dispute that González established\n\nthe first two elements of her malicious prosecution claim, nor do\n\nthey seem seriously to dispute the fourth.              They do, however,\n\nchallenge the existence of the third element:        whether some or all\n\nof them acted with malice and pursued González's indictment without\n\nprobable cause.     González argues that the evidence presented at\n\ntrial established this element.       She testified about how she was\n\nsingled out for harassment at the San Juan INS office following her\n\nrejection of Núñez.   She also testified that none of the Dominican\n\naliens the U.S. Attorney's office alleged to be her clients were,\n\nin fact, her clients.     According to González, Reyes thus had no\n\nbasis to conclude that she took part in a scheme to coach these\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fpersons    to   enter   into    sham   marriages,    and   he     had   no   basis\n\nsubsequently to seek her indictment.             González argued before the\n\ndistrict court, and reiterates to us, that the extreme animosity\n\ndemonstrated toward her at the San Juan INS office, combined with\n\nReyes's    lack   of    any    genuine    justification     for     seeking   her\n\nindictment and his supervisor Ramos's frequent lunches with Núñez,\n\npermits the reasonable inference that Reyes and the prosecutors who\n\nacted on his findings were motivated by malice in pursuing her\n\nprosecution.\n\n            The district court was unpersuaded by this theory and\n\nfound, on its assessment of the testimony of González and Reyes and\n\nother evidence, that González had not satisfied the third element\n\nof her malicious prosecution claim.            Specifically, the court found\n\nthat she had failed to prove any link between Reyes's investigation\n\nand actions by Núñez or other relevant INS officers who may have\n\nhad a vendetta against her, and that Ramos and Núñez's lunches\n\ntogether did not establish such a link.              On the other hand, the\n\ncourt credited Reyes's testimony that, before seeking González's\n\nindictment, he interviewed several persons suspected of entering\n\ninto sham marriages, and that these persons implicated González in\n\ncoaching them to circumvent the immigration laws.                       The court\n\nbelieved    Reyes's     assertion      that    it   was    this     information,\n\nsubsequently provided by Reyes to the U.S. Attorney's Office, that\n\nled the latter to apply for the search warrants.                  The court then\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\ffound that the evidence gathered in these searches -- especially\n\nthe coaching questionnaire4 -- established adequate probable cause\n\nfor   believing   González   had   committed   a   crime   (a   conclusion\n\nindependently reached by the magistrate who issued the search\n\nwarrants, the different magistrate who issued the arrest warrant,\n\nand the members of the grand jury).      See González-Rucci II, 460 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 313.\n\n           Our review of the record reveals ample support for the\n\ncourt's factual findings.     Reyes testified that he interviewed a\n\nnumber of Dominican aliens or their U.S. citizen spouses, and that\n\nthese persons described advice González gave them on various\n\naspects of entering into and maintaining sham marriages -- such as,\n\nfor example, registering a child fathered by a Dominican as having\n\nbeen fathered by a U.S. citizen husband, or divorcing a Dominican\n\nhusband and remarrying an American one to avoid deportation. Reyes\n\nalso testified that, although he and Núñez both worked at the INS,\n\nthey were not personal friends, and he did not recall Núñez ever\n\ndiscussing any aspect of González's case with him or forwarding him\n\nany information about her.    Reyes testified repeatedly and without\n\nequivocation that no one -- not Núñez, Ramos, or any other INS\n\nofficer -- directed him to seek out information that could be used\n\nagainst González, or to harass her in any way.\n\n\n4\n   With respect to the coaching questionnaire, the court remarked\nthat it \"certainly dissipate[d] any doubt concerning the legitimacy\nof the criminal charges leveled against plaintiff.\"\n\n                                   -9-\n\f            The district court, as the trier of fact, was entitled to\n\ncredit   Reyes's   testimony   as   a   true   account   of   what    actually\n\nhappened.   See Carr, 191 F.3d at 7 (\"We have said with a regularity\n\nbordering on the monotonous that, in a bench trial, credibility\n\ncalls are for the trier . . . .\") (citations omitted).               While the\n\ntestimony is not without a few minor inconsistencies -- seemingly\n\ndue in large part to Reyes's inability to remember certain details\n\nabout events that transpired more than ten years prior -- none of\n\nthese is anywhere near serious enough to render the district\n\ncourt's credibility assessment an abuse of discretion.

Computer Warehouse, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2443593\"><a href=\"/opinion/2443593/microsoft-corp-v-computer-warehouse/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n261 (D.P.R. 2000)).       In contrast to malicious prosecution claims,\n\nwhich \"are generally directed to a legal action as a whole,\" abuse\n\nof process claims \"typically cover[] challenges to the legal\n\naction's procedural components,\" such as subpoenas or discovery\n\nmechanisms.        Id. (citing Nogueras-Cartagena, 172 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n316).\n\n              The district court found that González \"did not meet her\n\nburden   of    showing   any   procedural   component   of   her   criminal\n\nprosecution was influenced by a bad motive, or conducted with the\n\npurpose of attaining an improper collateral objective,\" for two\n\nreasons.      González-Rucci II, 460 F. Supp. 2d at 314.       First, she\n\nfailed to put forth any evidence to show that Reyes or the\n\nprosecutors obtained her indictment by presenting knowingly false\n\ntestimony to the grand jury.      Second, she failed to prove that any\n\naspect of Reyes's investigation was at all related to her rejection\n\nof Núñez -- and thus potentially tainted by the latter's alleged\n\nresentment.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\f              What we have said above allows us easily to dispose of\n\nthis ground of appeal.           The district court was well within its\n\ndiscretion in determining that Reyes's investigation, and the\n\nactions of the U.S. Attorney's Office in response to Reyes's\n\nfindings, were performed in good faith and were not influenced by\n\nNúñez or anyone else at the INS office hostile to González.\n\nWithout this link, the record does not show the requisite bad\n\nmotive   on    the   part   of    Reyes   or   the   prosecutors   who   sought\n\nsubpoenas, undertook discovery, and participated in the other\n\nprocedural aspects of González's criminal case.             As such, we must\n\nalso affirm the dismissal of González's abuse of process claim.\n\n                                 III.   Conclusion\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the dismissal of\n\nGonzález's claims in all respects.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\f</pre>",
