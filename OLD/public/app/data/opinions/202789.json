Donahue, Assistant Corporation Counsel, with whom\nElizabeth L. Bostwick, Assistant Corporation Counsel, was on brief,\nfor appellees.\n\n\n\n                           June 12, 2007\n\f             HOWARD, Circuit Judge.   This is an appeal by   prevailing\n\nparties in civil rights litigation against the City of Boston,\n\nMassachusetts. The appellants have raised several claims of error,\n\nthe most important of which concerns circumstances under which a\n\nrejected offer of judgment, pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 68, will\n\ncut off a prevailing party's entitlement to attorney's fees.\n\n             Albertha Bogan and her three children1 brought an action\n\nagainst the City, Mayor Thomas Menino, Commissioner of Inspectional\n\nServices Kevin Joyce, three Inspectional Services employees,2 the\n\nNeighborhood Development Corporation of Grove Hall (NDC), and one\n\nof its founding members, Virginia Morrison, claiming violations of\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 and various torts under Massachusetts law.        The\n\nplaintiffs alleged that Inspectional Services employees illegally\n\ninspected the Bogans' property in the Dorchester section of Boston,\n\nat the behest of Mayor Menino, to force them to sell their property\n\nin favor of an economic development project spearheaded by the NDC.\n\nThe defendants claimed that the inspection was ordered because the\n\nproperty was being operated as an illegal rooming house and was in\n\ndisrepair.\n\n             The inspection took place in March 1999 and resulted in\n\nthe issuance of fifty building code violation citations and a\n\nrooming house violation.     As a result of the inspection, the City\n\n\n     1\n         Tyla Bogan, Eryn Bogan and Chad Bogan.\n     2\n         Luis Arjona, James Holmes, and Regina Hanson.\n\n                                  -2-\n\fordered the Bogans to vacate the property and that it be condemned.\n\nA few days after the inspection, the City filed a complaint in the\n\nMassachusetts Housing Court to enforce the condemnation order. The\n\nBogans resisted the Housing Court complaint and also litigated the\n\nvalidity of the code violation citations before the Massachusetts\n\nBuilding Code Appeals Board. In June 1999, the Housing Court found\n\nthat the inspection of the Bogans' home was an illegal regulatory\n\nsearch and vacated virtually all of the code violations.\n\n             Almost three years later, on March 22, 2002, the Bogans\n\nfiled the instant federal action, claiming damages as a result of\n\nthe   defendants'        inspection   and   post-inspection        conduct.     The\n\ncomplaint stated claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violations of\n\nthe    Fourth      and   Fourteenth   Amendments,      as   well    as   trespass,\n\nconversion of real and personal property, invasion of privacy,\n\nharassment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.\n\n             In due course, the City and individual defendants moved\n\nfor partial summary judgment.          The district judge granted summary\n\njudgment for the individual defendants on the § 1983 claim because\n\nthey were sued only in their official capacities and their presence\n\nwas not necessary since the City was sued directly.                The judge also\n\ngranted summary judgment for the City on the tort claims on the\n\nbasis of sovereign immunity.          The judge did, however, permit most\n\nof    the   tort    claims   to   proceed    against    Joyce      and   the   other\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fInspectional Services employees.3         As for the state law claims\n\nagainst Mayor Menino, the judge granted summary judgment on the\n\ntrespass, conversion, and invasion of privacy claims because the\n\nMayor was not present during the inspection, and on the intentional\n\ninfliction    of   emotional   distress   claim   because   there    was   no\n\nevidence that the Mayor ordered the inspection to cause the Bogans\n\ndistress.4\n\n             On March 10, 2005, the City made the Bogans an offer of\n\njudgment under Fed. R. Civ. P. 68 for $50,000, which they rejected.\n\nThe district judge then ordered the bifurcation of the remaining\n\nclaims so that the § 1983 claims against the City and the tort\n\nclaims against Joyce would be tried first. See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n42(b).\n\n             In September 2005, the parties agreed to try the case to\n\na jury before a magistrate judge.         After an eight-day trial, the\n\njury found in favor of the Bogans on the § 1983 claim against the\n\nCity, but found in favor of Joyce on the tort claims.               The jury\n\nawarded the Bogans a total of $30,000 in damages.5          The defendants\n\n\n\n     3\n      The judge dismissed the harassment claim against all\ndefendants because harassment is not a recognized tort under\nMassachusetts law.\n     4\n      The judge also granted summary judgment to the NDC and\nMorrison because there was no evidence that they were involved in\nany wrongdoing.\n     5\n      Albertha Bogan was awarded $15,000 and her children were\nawarded $5,000 each.\n\n                                   -4-\n\fthen moved to dismiss the remaining tort claims on the ground that\n\nany damages award at a second trial would be duplicative because\n\nthe § 1983 award against the City compensated the Bogans for their\n\nentire injury.      The magistrate judge agreed and dismissed the\n\nremaining claims.\n\n          Thereafter, the Bogans moved for an award of $113,311.50\n\nin attorney's fees and $13,389.33 in costs under 42 U.S.C. § 1988.\n\nThe magistrate judge reduced the fee award to $13,264.87 and the\n\ncost award to $3,694.84.    The judge then entered a final judgment\n\nordering the City to pay the Bogans a total of $46,959.71. The\n\nBogans filed this appeal, raising a series of challenges to rulings\n\nmade during the pretrial and trial proceedings and to various\n\nreductions made in their request for fees and costs.\n\n          The Bogans first claim that they were prejudiced by the\n\nimproper issuance of a protective order preventing them from\n\ndeposing Mayor Menino.    The district judge granted the protective\n\norder on the ground that the Bogans had failed to demonstrate that\n\nthe information they sought from the Mayor was unavailable from\n\nother sources.      The Bogans contend that they should have been\n\nallowed to depose the Mayor because they uncovered evidence that\n\nthe Mayor directly ordered the inspection of their property.   They\n\nhypothesize that, if they had been permitted to depose the Mayor,\n\nthey may have learned that he ordered the search to intimidate them\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\finto selling their property to make way for the NDC-sponsored\n\nproject.\n\n             The district court is empowered by Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(c)\n\nto grant a protective order from discovery for \"good cause shown.\"\n\nAppellate review of such orders is limited.             \"We will intervene in\n\n[discovery]      matters    only   upon    a    clear   showing    of    manifest\n\ninjustice, that is, where the lower court's discovery order was\n\nplainly    wrong    and    resulted   in    substantial    prejudice      to     the\n\naggrieved party.\"         Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers Squibb Co., 95\n\nF.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n            The need for limited access to high government officials\n\nthrough the discovery process is well established.                      In United\n\nStates v. Morgan, 313 U.S. 409, 422 (1941), the Supreme Court\n\nindicated that the practice of calling high ranking government\n\nofficials as witnesses should be discouraged.             Relying on Morgan,\n\nother courts have concluded that top executive department officials\n\nshould    not,   absent    extraordinary       circumstances,     be    called    to\n\ntestify or deposed regarding their reasons for taking official\n\naction. Simplex Time Recorder Co. v. Sec'y of Labor, 766 F.2d 575,\n\n586 (D.C. Cir. 1985); see also In re United States (Holder), 197\n\nF.3d 310, 313 (8th Cir. 1999); In re FDIC, 58 F.3d 1055, 1060 (5th\n\nCir. 1995); In re United States (Kessler), 985 F.2d 510, 512 (11th\n\nCir. 1993).      This rule is based on the notion that \"[h]igh ranking\n\ngovernment officials have greater duties and time constraints than\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fother witnesses\" and that, without appropriate limitations, such\n\nofficials will spend an inordinate amount of time tending to\n\npending litigation.     Kessler, 985 F.2d at 512.\n\n            But this limitation is not absolute. Depositions of high\n\nranking officials may be permitted where the official has first-\n\nhand knowledge related to the claim being litigated.                See Baine v.\n\nGen. Motors Corp., 141 F.R.D. 332, 335 (M.D. Ala. 1991); Church of\n\nScientology of Boston v. IRS, 138 F.R.D. 9, 12 (D. Mass. 1990);\n\nCmty. Fed. Sav. & Loan Ass'n v. Fed. Home Loan Bank Bd., 96 F.R.D.\n\n619, 621 (D.D.C. 1983).     However, even in such cases, discovery is\n\npermitted only where it is shown that other persons cannot provide\n\nthe   necessary    information.           Holder,     197        F.3d   at    314.\n\n            The parties agree that Mayor Menino is a high ranking\n\ngovernment official and therefore is not subject to being deposed\n\nabsent a demonstrated need.         See Marisol v. Giuliani, 1998 WL\n\n132810, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 23, 1998) (treating a mayor as a high\n\nranking    government   official   for    purposes     of    a    motion     for   a\n\nprotective order from discovery).            The question therefore is\n\nwhether the Bogans established sufficient need to warrant discovery\n\ndirectly   from   the   Mayor.     The    Bogans    rely    on    evidence    that\n\ndefendant Hanson, one of the Inspectional Services employees, wrote\n\na note on the day of the inspection to the effect that the Mayor's\n\noffice had received complaints from neighbors about the Bogans'\n\nproperty and that the Mayor had ordered the inspection as a result.\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fThey also rely on the fact that the inspection was ordered on the\n\nheels of their disclosing to the NDC that the property was being\n\nused as a rooming house.     The Bogans assert that these strands of\n\nevidence support an inference that the Mayor ordered the inspection\n\non a tip from the NDC because of their shared goal to force the\n\nBogans from the property.\n\n             The Bogans' argument founders because they did not pursue\n\nother sources to obtain relevant information before turning to the\n\nMayor.     Hanson testified that she did not recall why she had\n\nwritten that the Mayor had ordered the inspection, and Joyce\n\ntestified that he ordered the inspection without a directive from\n\nthe Mayor.    Thus, the identity of the City official who ordered the\n\ninspection and the reason for the inspection were disputed issues\n\nof fact.     The Bogans nevertheless failed to purse discovery from\n\nother City employees who could have shed light on the Mayor's\n\ninvolvement. In particular, the Bogans did not seek discovery from\n\nany of the Mayor's aides.    It is certainly likely that at least one\n\nof these employees was involved and could have clarified the\n\nMayor's role.     It was therefore incumbent on the Bogans to seek\n\ninformation from these individuals before turning to the Mayor.\n\nSee Alexander v. FBI, 186 F.R.D. 1, 5 (D.D.C. 1998) (denying a\n\nrequest for discovery of a high ranking government official because\n\n\"there are other avenues of discovery that plaintiffs may purse to\n\nestablish    their   theory\");   Marisol   A.,   1998   WL   132810,   at   *4\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\f(granting the mayor a protective order where relevant discovery\n\ncould be obtained from other city employees).        Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict judge did not abuse his discretion in issuing a protective\n\norder for Mayor Menino because the Bogans had not exhausted other\n\navailable avenues of discovery.\n\n          The Bogans also claim that, even on the record as it\n\nexisted without the additional discovery, summary judgment was\n\nimprovidently granted on the intentional infliction of emotional\n\ndistress claim against the Mayor.6      We review the grant of summary\n\njudgment de novo, construing the record in favor of the nonmoving\n\nparty.   See Wolinetz v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co., 361 F.3d 44, 47\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).   Summary judgment is appropriately granted where\n\nthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving\n\nparty is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.      Id.\n\n          The district judge granted summary judgment for the Mayor\n\non the ground that there was no evidence that the Mayor ordered the\n\ninspection of the Bogans' property for the purpose of inflicting\n\nemotional distress.   We agree.      The note written by Hanson was\n\nsufficient to permit a factfinder to conclude that the Mayor\n\nordered the inspection. But there is no evidence that would permit\n\na finding that the Mayor did so to inflict emotional distress on\n\n\n     6\n      There is no developed argument concerning the grant of\nsummary judgment for the Mayor on the other intentional tort claims\nor against Morrison and the NDC on any of the claims. Therefore,\nany challenges to these rulings are waived. See United States v.\nZannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                  -9-\n\fthe Bogans.    See Conley v. Romeri, 806 N.E.2d 933, 937 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 2004) (stating that to prevail on an infliction of emotional\n\ndistress claim, the plaintiff must establish \"that the defendant\n\nintended to inflict emotional distress, or knew or should have\n\nknown that emotional distress was the likely result of [the]\n\nconduct\").     The note itself stated that the Mayor ordered the\n\ninspection    because   of   neighbor    complaints   about   the   Bogans'\n\nproperty.     The Bogans contend that this reason was false and that\n\nthe Mayor ordered the inspection because he wanted to force them\n\nfrom the property. This is mere conjecture. See Podiatrist Ass'n,\n\nInc. v. La Cruz De P.R., Inc., 332 F.3d 6, 17 (1st Cir. 2003)\n\n(stating that a claim based on \"unsupported conjecture . . . cannot\n\nwithstand summary judgment\").           The Bogans have not identified\n\nevidence of the Mayor's desire to promote the proposed development\n\nproject by evicting the Bogans or even that the NDC and the Mayor\n\ndiscussed the status of the Bogans' property.           Indeed, there is\n\nnothing in the record to suggest that the rationale articulated in\n\nHanson's note was pretext.       On this record, the district judge\n\ncorrectly found that Mayor Menino was entitled to summary judgment\n\non the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.\n\n            The Bogans next contest a series of rulings by the\n\nmagistrate judge excluding the admission of various pieces of\n\nevidence at trial, but they have not filed a trial transcript.         The\n\nparty asserting a claim of error maintains the burden of procuring\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fthe transcript where a transcript is necessary to decide the\n\nclaims. See Fed. R. App. P. 10(b); Feliciano-Hill v. Principi, 439\n\nF.3d       18,   23    n.3   (1st   Cir.   2006).7      Because   the    review   of\n\nevidentiary rulings are typically fact-intensive and an erroneous\n\nevidentiary ruling does not require a new trial if harmless,\n\nsee Rodriguez-Hernandez v. Miranda-Velez, 132 F.3d 848, 855 (1st\n\nCir. 1998),           the relevant transcripts are essential to meaningful\n\nappellate review.            Accordingly, \"[c]hallenges to the admission of\n\nevidence will not be considered by the Court of Appeals in the\n\nabsence of a record containing those portions of the transcript on\n\nwhich the appellant relies.\" United States v. Davis, 60 F.3d 1479,\n\n1482 (10th Cir. 1995) (internal citation omitted); see Loren v.\n\nSasser, 309 F.3d 1296, 1304 (11th Cir. 2002).                  Because the Bogans\n\nhave not provided an adequate record to review their evidentiary\n\nchallenges, we decline to consider them.                See Faigin v. Kelly, 184\n\nF.3d 67, 87 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                 Finally, the Bogans challenge the magistrate judge's\n\nruling that it was not necessary to try the tort claims against the\n\nremaining        Inspectional       Services      employees.    They    argue   that\n\npermitting a second trial on these tort claims could result in an\n\naward of damages for injuries that they suffered post-inspection,\n\n\n\n       7\n      In the alternative, a party can submit an agreed statement of\nthe record or a statement of proceedings approved by the district\ncourt.   See Fed. R. App. P. 10(c) & (d).       The Bogans pursued\nneither of these avenues.\n\n                                           -11-\n\fwhich they contend were not encompassed in the § 1983 award against\n\nthe City.       According to the Bogans, they presented two theories of\n\n§   1983    liability     against    the    City,       one    based   on   the   Fourth\n\nAmendment and the other based on the Fourteenth Amendment.                          The\n\nFourth Amendment claim, they say, was limited to damages arising\n\nfrom the inspection itself, while the Fourteenth Amendment claim\n\nencompassed        damages      arising    from    the    City's       post-inspection\n\nconduct.        The Bogans interpret the modest amount awarded on the §\n\n1983 claim to mean that the jury compensated them for injuries\n\nsustained       during    the    inspection       but    not    for    post-inspection\n\ndamages.\n\n                \"[T]he law abhors duplicative recoveries\"; thus double\n\nawards for the same injury are impermissible.                     Dopp v. HTP Corp.,\n\n947 F.2d 506, 517 (1st Cir. 1991).                Compensatory damages in § 1983\n\ncases remedy only actual injuries caused by the violation, and the\n\nlevel of damages is ordinarily determined according to common law\n\ntort principles.          See Memphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477\n\nU.S. 299, 313 (1986); Acevedo-Garcia v. Monroig, 351 F.3d 547, 567-\n\n68 (1st Cir. 2003).          Thus, \"[i]f a [§ 1983] claim and a state claim\n\narise from the same operative facts, and seek identical relief, an\n\naward      of   damages   under     both    theories      will    constitute      double\n\nrecovery.\"        Mason v. Okla. Tpk. Auth., 115 F.3d 1442, 1459 (10th\n\nCir. 1997) (internal citation omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                           -12-\n\f            The magistrate judge concluded that the Bogans' trial\n\npresentation of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment theories was\n\nidentical -- encompassing both the City's inspection and post-\n\ninspection conduct and seeking all damages incurred as a result.\n\nBecause the Bogans have not provided us with a trial transcript, we\n\nhave no basis to question the magistrate judge's view of the\n\nevidence.   We note, however, that this view is consistent with the\n\nBogans' statement at the pretrial conference that all of their\n\nclaims were based on the same underlying facts.      And it is also\n\nconsistent with the Bogans' acceptance of a verdict form on the §\n\n1983 claim that did not require the jury to distinguish between the\n\nFourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment theories of liability.\n\nIn these circumstances, the magistrate judge correctly ruled that\n\nthe jury awarded full compensation to the Bogans, and therefore a\n\nsubsequent trial on the remaining claims was unwarranted.       See\n\nGilmere v. City of Atlanta, 864 F.2d 734, 740-41 (11th Cir. 1989)\n\n(holding that the district court properly refused to award damages\n\nfor state-law tort claims where the jury had awarded damages on §\n\n1983 claims based on identical facts).\n\n            We now turn to the Bogans' challenges to the award of\n\nfees and costs.   We first summarize the magistrate judge's ruling\n\nand then consider the Bogans' specific challenges.\n\n            Under 42 U.S.C. § 1988, the fee-shifting statute under\n\nwhich the Bogans were awarded fees for prevailing on their § 1983\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fclaim, a trial court generally should employ the lodestar method to\n\ncalculate fees.      Under this method, a court usually should begin\n\nwith the attorneys' contemporaneous billing records.                  Gay Officers\n\nAction League v. Puerto Rico, 247 F.3d 288, 295 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nThe   court    should     then   subtract    hours    that      are   duplicative,\n\nunproductive or excessive and multiply the reasonable hours billed\n\nby the prevailing attorney rate in the community.                Id.;   Lipsett v.\n\nBlanco, 975 F.2d 934, 937 (1st Cir. 1992).                The resulting amount\n\nconstitutes the lodestar.           After calculating the lodestar, the\n\ncourt may then adjust the award further for any of several reasons,\n\nincluding the quantum of success achieved in the litigation.\n\nCoutin v. Young & Rubicam P.R., Inc., 124 F.3d 331, 337 n.3 (1st\n\nCir. 1997).\n\n              The magistrate judge employed this method in determining\n\nthe appropriate fee award.         The judge made several reductions from\n\nthe reasonable hours expended on the litigation, including time\n\naccrued prior to the preparation of the Bogans' federal complaint\n\nin December 2001, and time spent on claims dismissed at summary\n\njudgment that were severable from the successful § 1983 claim. The\n\njudge   also    reduced    the   billing     rate    of   one    of   the   Bogans'\n\nattorneys, Harold Jacobi, from $350 to $300.              After accounting for\n\nthese reductions, the judge calculated a lodestar figure -- not\n\nincluding fees incurred after the Bogans rejected the defendants'\n\nRule 68 offer of judgment, see infra, -- of $26,529.74.                  The judge\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fthen reduced this figure by fifty percent because much of the trial\n\nfocused on the unsuccessful claims against Joyce, and the ultimate\n\ndamage award on the § 1983 claim was modest.         After all reductions,\n\nthe judge determined that an award of $13,264.87 in pre-offer fees\n\nwas reasonable.\n\n           The magistrate judge then considered the Bogans' request\n\nfor $13,389.33 in costs. As with the award of pre-offer attorney's\n\nfees, the judge excluded costs incurred prior to the preparation of\n\nthe   federal   complaint   and   costs    related   to   the     unsuccessful\n\nseverable claims dismissed at summary judgment. The judge also cut\n\notherwise collectable research costs in half in the absence of\n\nsufficient   information    to    determine   whether     these    costs   were\n\nincurred for research related to the successful claims.                    After\n\nmaking these reductions, the judge calculated that the Bogans were\n\nentitled to pre-offer costs of $3,694.84.\n\n           Having concluded that the Bogans were entitled to a total\n\naward of $16,959.71 in pre-offer fees and costs, the magistrate\n\njudge considered whether the Bogans were entitled to recover post-\n\noffer fees and costs.       The judge observed that, under Rule 68, a\n\nprevailing party may not receive fees and costs incurred after\n\nreceiving an offer of judgment, if the judgment finally obtained is\n\nworth less than the offer.        The judge further observed that, to\n\ndetermine the size of the judgment finally obtained, the court must\n\nadd the jury verdict to the amount of pre-offer fees and costs\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fawarded.      Because the jury verdict of $30,000 plus the pre-offer\n\nfees and costs award of $16,959.71 was less than the City's $50,000\n\noffer of judgment, the judge determined that the Bogans were not\n\nentitled to an award of post-offer fees and costs.\n\n             A fee award will be upheld unless it constitutes a\n\n\"manifest abuse of discretion.\" See Richardson v. Miller, 279 F.3d\n\n1, 2-3 (1st Cir. 2002).          The trial court has \"extremely broad\"\n\ndiscretion in fashioning a fee award.              Lipsett, 975 F.2d at 937.\n\n\"Because this is so, and because the determination of the extent of\n\na reasonable fee necessarily involves a series of judgment calls,\n\nan appellate court is far more likely to defer to the trial court\n\nin reviewing fee computations than in many other situations.\"                  Id.\n\n             The Bogans first claim that the magistrate judge abused\n\nher   discretion      by   excluding    all     fees   incurred   prior   to   the\n\npreparation of their federal complaint in December 2001.                       From\n\nMarch 1999 through December 2001, the Bogans' counsel litigated the\n\nCity's conduct in the Massachusetts Housing Court and before the\n\nMassachusetts Building Code Appeals Board. The Bogans contend that\n\nthe   time    spent   litigating       before    these   state    tribunals     was\n\nrecoverable under 42 U.S.C. § 1988 because the state proceedings\n\npermitted the Bogans to mitigate the damages available to them in\n\ntheir subsequent § 1983 action.\n\n               Section 1988 provides that attorney's fees may be\n\nawarded      \"in any action or proceeding to enforce provisions of §\n\n\n                                        -16-\n\f1983.\"      However,   fees   incurred     in   proceedings   prior   to   the\n\npreparation of the § 1983 complaint are not recoverable, unless the\n\npre-preparation time was \"both useful and of a type ordinarily\n\nnecessary to advance the civil rights litigation to the stage it\n\nreached.\"    Webb v. Bd. of Educ., 471 U.S. 234, 243 (1985).           Under\n\nthis standard, fees incurred in ancillary state proceedings that\n\nare   necessary   to   pursue   a   federal     civil   rights   action    are\n\nrecoverable, e.g., N.Y. Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey, 447 U.S. 54,\n\n71 (1980); Exeter-West Greenwich Reg. Sch. Dist. v. Pontarelli, 788\n\nF.2d 47, 51 (1st Cir. 1986), while fees incurred during proceedings\n\nthat are unnecessary for bringing the federal action are not,\n\nWebb, 471 U.S. at 241.8\n\n            The Bogans were not required to pursue remedies in the\n\nMassachusetts Housing Court or before the Massachusetts Building\n\nCode Appeals Board to proceed against the City under § 1983.\n\nSection 1983 contains no exhaustion requirement, and thus the\n\nBogans' federal claim ripened immediately following the City's\n\n\n      8\n      Sometimes a court may grant a partial award for work done\nduring an ancillary proceeding where a discrete portion of the work\nwas both useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to advance the\n§ 1983 claim. E.g., Keenan v. City of Philadelphia, 983 F.2d 459,\n474 (3d Cir. 1992) (allowing fees where product of discovery in\nancillary proceeding was later used in federal action). The Bogans\nhave not attempted to identify a discrete portion of fees incurred\nduring the ancillary proceedings that were useful and necessary to\nthe § 1983 action. Rather, they seek an award of all fees incurred\nduring the ancillary proceedings.      See Webb, 471 U.S. at 241\n(denying the award of all fees incurred during pre-suit\nadministrative proceeding where the plaintiff argued only that all\ntime spent should be included in the § 1988 award).\n\n                                    -17-\n\fwrongful conduct.         See Patsy v. Fla. Bd. of Regents, 457 U.S. 496\n\n1982).        The    results     obtained    by   the    Bogans     in   these   state\n\nproceedings         may   have   reduced     their      actual    damages,    thereby\n\nmitigating the damages available to them in the subsequent § 1983\n\naction.   See Meyers v. City of Cincinnati, 14 F.3d 1115, 1119 (6th\n\nCir. 1994) (stating that a plaintiff has a duty under § 1983 to\n\nmitigate damages).             But commencing these proceedings was not\n\nnecessary to bringing their § 1983 claim.                        If ancillary state\n\nproceedings brought to mitigate damages in an eventual § 1983 suit\n\nwere sufficient to bring all fees incurred in those proceedings\n\nwithin the ambit of § 1988, the limitation established by Webb\n\nwould    be    virtually       meaningless.       After      all,   most     ancillary\n\nproceedings to obtain relief from the alleged wrong underlying a §\n\n1983 suit will, if successful, mitigate the damages flowing from\n\nthat wrong.\n\n              Indeed,     Webb    itself    involved     a   situation     where   the\n\nancillary proceeding could have mitigated the damages available to\n\nthe plaintiff in his subsequent § 1983 action.                   The Webb plaintiff\n\nwas terminated from his position as a school teacher and claimed\n\nthat the dismissal was racially motivated.                   471 U.S. at 236.      The\n\nplaintiff pursued administrative remedies before the local school\n\nboard prior to commencing a § 1983 action in federal court.                      Id. at\n\n236-37.       If the plaintiff had been successful in obtaining relief\n\nthrough the administrative proceeding, his actual damages from the\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\ftermination would have been reduced.         The Court nevertheless held\n\nthat the fees incurred during the administrative proceeding could\n\nnot be recovered under § 1988.          Id. at 240.    The same rationale\n\ngoverns here.\n\n           The Bogans' second challenge to the fee award concerns\n\nthe exclusion of time spent litigating claims dismissed at summary\n\njudgment which the magistrate judge determined were severable from\n\nthe § 1983 claim.         The Bogans assert that this severability\n\nconclusion was an abuse of discretion because all claims arose from\n\nthe same core of operative facts.\n\n           \"[W]ork on an unsuccessful claim cannot be deemed to have\n\nbeen expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved . . . and\n\ntherefore no fee may be awarded for services on the unsuccessful\n\nclaim.\"    Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 435 (1983). This\n\nrationale for discounting hours spent on unsuccessful claims does\n\nnot apply, however, where both the successful and unsuccessful\n\nclaims arose from the same common core of facts or were based on\n\nrelated legal theories.         Id.     This is so because \"[m]uch of\n\ncounsel's time will be devoted generally to the litigation as a\n\nwhole, making it difficult to divide the hours expended on a claim-\n\nby-claim basis.\"    Id.   Thus, fees are appropriately excluded from\n\nthe   lodestar   only   \"when   different    claims   for   relief   are   not\n\ninterconnected, that is, when the claims rest on different facts\n\n\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fand legal theories.\"   Figueroa-Torres v. Toledo-Davila, 232 F.3d\n\n270, 278 (1st Cir. 2000) (citing Coutin, 124 F.3d at 339).\n\n           The magistrate judge excluded time spent on the claims\n\nagainst the Mayor, the NDC, and Morrison premised on the theory\n\nthat these defendants acted in concert to intimidate the Bogans by\n\norchestrating the inspection to force them from the property.   The\n\nsalient facts underlying these claims related to the pre-inspection\n\nmotives and conduct of these actors.      In contrast, the award\n\nagainst the City was premised on inspection and post-inspection\n\nconduct.   Thus, the unsuccessful claims excluded from the lodestar\n\nwere predicated on facts different from those underlying the\n\nmeritorious claim, and the magistrate judge did not abuse her\n\ndiscretion in excluding time spent on these unsuccessful claims.9\n\nSee Figuero-Torres, 232 F.3d at 278-79 (holding that fees incurred\n\nin litigating dismissed claims against a supervisor, who was not at\n\nscene of arrest, were severable from fees incurred litigating\n\nsuccessful claim against the arresting officers).\n\n           The Bogans' final challenge to the lodestar calculation\n\nconcerns the reduction of Jacobi's billing rate from $350 to $300.\n\nA \"district court . . . is not bound by the hourly rate requested\n\nby the victor's counsel.\"    Phetosomphone v. Allison Reed Group,\n\nInc., 984 F.2d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 1993).       A court may reduce an\n\n\n     9\n      The Bogans have not claimed that any particular time entry\nwas incorrectly identified as related to one of the severable,\nunsuccessful claims.\n\n                               -20-\n\fattorney's hourly rate based on the type of work that attorney\n\nperformed during the litigation. See Miles v. Sampson, 675 F.2d 5,\n\n9 (1st Cir. 1982).   In this regard, we have affirmed a reduction in\n\nthe billable rate of an attorney because the attorney, even though\n\na \"partner,\" assumed \"the role of an associate\" at the trial by\n\nperforming less complex tasks. O'Rourke v. City of Providence, 235\n\nF.3d 713, 737 (1st Cir. 2001).           The magistrate judge reduced\n\nJacobi's fee rate for similar reasons.         Even though the Bogans\n\nestablished that a rate of $350 per hour was generally appropriate\n\nfor an attorney at Jacobi's experience level, the magistrate judge\n\nconcluded that a $50 reduction was appropriate because Jacobi had\n\n\"limited involvement\"    in the case and \"was not present at any time\n\nduring the eight day trial.\"     We have no basis for upsetting this\n\nassessment   of   Jacobi's   participation   nor   for   questioning   the\n\nresulting modest reduction in his billing rate.\n\n          In addition to challenging the lodestar calculation, the\n\nBogans object to the additional fifty percent reduction of the fee\n\naward based on their limited success at trial.           They assert that\n\nthe reduction for a lack of success was predicated on the same\n\nfailed claims that the magistrate judge excluded from the lodestar,\n\nand therefore the magistrate judge impermissibly double counted the\n\ntime spent on these failed claims.\n\n          This argument misunderstands the basis for the further\n\nreduction. This reduction was not, as the Bogans posit, to account\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\ffor the lack of success on the severable claims that were dismissed\n\nat summary judgment.    The reduction was made to account for the\n\ntime spent on the failed common law claims against Joyce, which\n\nwere interconnected with the § 1983 claim (and therefore not\n\nexcluded from the lodestar) and to reflect the relatively meager\n\nsize of the jury verdict on the § 1983 claim.           Consequently, the\n\nBogans' argument that the magistrate judge twice reduced the fee\n\naward based on the severable claims that were dismissed at summary\n\njudgment is without merit.\n\n           This leaves the Bogans' more general claim that, aside\n\nfrom double counting, the fifty percent additional reduction was\n\nexcessive.   The Supreme Court has held that a reduction of a fee\n\naward beyond the lodestar may be appropriate where the plaintiff is\n\nunsuccessful on interrelated claims and ultimately obtains only\n\nlimited   success.   See   Hensley,   461   U.S.   at   436;   Andrade   v.\n\nJamestown Hous. Auth., 82 F.3d 1179, 1191 (1st Cir. 1996) (holding\n\nthat where \"multiple claims are interrelated and a plaintiff has\n\nachieved only limited success . . . a court may . . . simply reduce\n\nthe award to account for the limited success\").          A trial court's\n\ndetermination to reduce a fee award to account for the plaintiff's\n\nlimited success is entitled to \"great deference.\"          Diaz-Rivera v.\n\nRivera-Rodriguez, 377 F.3d 119, 126 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n           Much of our focus in reviewing a fee award is on assuring\n\nthat the trial court provides an adequate explanation for its\n\n\n                                -22-\n\factions.   See Wennik v. Polygram Group Dist., Inc., 304 F.3d 123,\n\n134 (1st Cir. 2002); Coutin, 124 F.3d at 337.      Especially where, as\n\nhere, a fee award is substantially reduced, the trial court is\n\nexpected to provide a detailed explanation for its action.            See\n\nRodriguez-Hernandez,   132   F.3d    at    858.   The   magistrate   judge\n\nfulfilled this obligation; her careful order delineated in detail\n\nthe reasons for the fifty percent reduction.10             Even were we\n\ninclined to be more generous \"if writing on a pristine page,\" Diaz-\n\nRivera, 377 F.3d at 127, the Bogans have not demonstrated an abuse\n\nof discretion in ordering a fifty percent reduction.11\n\n\n\n\n     10\n      We reject the Bogans' argument that the magistrate judge did\nnot adequately consider the societal importance of this litigation\nin making the fifty-percent reduction. The Bogans contend that\nthis litigation resulted in a change in official policy, but the\nrecord shows that this change took place before the federal action\neven commenced.\n\n     11\n        The Bogans also raise three challenges to the reduction in\ntheir request for costs, which we deal with summarily. First, they\nclaim that costs incurred in the taking of a deposition of a trial\nwitness, prior to the preparation of their federal complaint, was\nimproperly excluded because the witness provided testimony at trial\nthat was relevant to the § 1983 claim. Without a trial transcript,\nwe cannot ascertain the subject of the witness' testimony and\ntherefore cannot disturb the exclusion. Second, they contest the\nexclusion of costs related to the severable, unsuccessful claims\ndismissed at summary judgment.      For the reasons stated above\nconcerning the exclusion of fees, there was also no abuse of\ndiscretion in excluding these costs. Finally, they assert that it\nwas an abuse of discretion to reduce research costs by fifty\npercent. We have reviewed the billing submissions and conclude\nthat there was no abuse of discretion in reducing these costs\nbecause the bills do not indicate whether the costs were incurred\non research related to the successful claims. See Parker v. Town\nof Swansea, 310 F. Supp. 2d 376, 400 (D. Mass. 2004).\n\n                                    -23-\n\f           The Bogans' last challenge to the award of fees and costs\n\nconcerns the denial of all fees and costs incurred after the City\n\nmade its Rule 68 offer of judgment.           The parties correctly agree\n\nthat, under Rule 68, a prevailing party is not permitted to recover\n\nfees or costs incurred after an offer of judgment, where the\n\njudgment   finally   obtained    is    less   than   the   offer.   City    of\n\nRiverside v. Rivera, 477 U.S. 561, 580 (1986).               They disagree,\n\nhowever, over the method for calculating the size of the judgment\n\nfinally obtained.     The Bogans contend that the judgment finally\n\nobtained includes the actual amount awarded by the jury ($30,000)\n\nand the amount of pre-offer attorney's fees and costs that they\n\nrequested ($63,431.69).         The City counters that the judgment\n\nfinally obtained includes only the jury award and the pre-offer\n\nfees and costs actually awarded by the court ($16,959.71).\n\n           The cases support the City's position. Rule 68 provides,\n\nin relevant part, that a party defending against a claim may make\n\nan offer of judgment, which includes \"costs then accrued.\"           If the\n\noffer of judgment is rejected and \"the judgment finally obtained\"\n\nis less favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay costs\n\nincurred after the making of the offer.          Fed. R. Civ. P. 68.       The\n\n\"judgment finally obtained\" under Rule 68 includes the damage award\n\nplus pre-offer fees and costs actually awarded.             See Scheeler v.\n\nCrane Co., 21 F.3d 791, 793 (8th Cir. 1994);           Marryshow v. Flynn,\n\n986 F.2d 689, 692 (4th Cir. 1993); Grosvenor v. Brienen, 801 F.2d\n\n\n                                      -24-\n\f944,    948    (7th    Cir.    1986).       The    Fourth   Circuit    has   cogently\n\nexplained the rationale for this rule:\n\n              Rule 68 requires that a comparison be made\n              between an offer of judgment that includes\n              'costs then accrued' and the 'judgment finally\n              obtained'. . . . To make a proper comparison\n              between the offer of judgment and the judgment\n              obtained when determining, for Rule 68\n              purposes, which is the more favorable, like\n              'judgments' must be evaluated.     Because the\n              offer includes costs then accrued, to determine\n              whether      the judgment obtained is more\n              favorable . . . the judgment must be defined on\n              the     same    basis    --    verdict     plus\n              costs incurred as of the time of the offer of\n              judgment.\n\nMarryshow, 986 F.2d at 692.\n\n              The Bogans' argument for crediting their request for pre-\n\noffer fees and costs, instead of the amount actually awarded by the\n\ncourt, is illogical.            If this were the rule, a prevailing party\n\ncould    always       evade    the   Rule    68    bar   simply   by   asking   for   a\n\nsufficiently large fee award so that the judgment finally obtained\n\nexceeds the offer.            Not surprisingly, there is no caselaw to this\n\neffect.       See Scheeler, 21 F.3d at 793 (concluding that amount of\n\npre-offer fees and costs credited as part of the \"judgment finally\n\nobtained\" included the reasonable fees and costs awarded by the\n\ncourt); Marryshow, 986 F.2d at 692 (same).

The appellants have raised several claims of error, the most important of which concerns circumstances under which a rejected offer of judgment, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 68, will cut off a prevailing party's entitlement to attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Albertha Bogan and her three children<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> brought an action against the City, Mayor Thomas Menino, Commissioner of Inspectional Services Kevin Joyce, three Inspectional Services employees,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the Neighborhood Development Corporation of Grove Hall (NDC), and one of its founding members, Virginia Morrison, claiming violations of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and various torts under Massachusetts law. The plaintiffs alleged that Inspectional Services employees illegally inspected the Bogans' property in the Dorchester section of Boston, at the behest of Mayor Menino, to force them to sell their property in favor of an economic development project spearheaded by the NDC. The defendants claimed that the inspection was ordered because the property was being operated as an illegal rooming house and was in disrepair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inspection took place in March 1999 and resulted in the issuance of fifty building code violation citations and a rooming house violation. As a result of the inspection, the City ordered the Bogans to vacate the property and that it be condemned. A few days after the inspection, the City filed a complaint in the Massachusetts Housing Court to enforce the condemnation order. The Bogans resisted the Housing Court complaint and also litigated the validity of the code violation citations before the Massachusetts Building Code Appeals Board. In June 1999, the Housing Court found that the inspection of the Bogans' home was an illegal regulatory search and vacated virtually all of the code violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Almost three years later, on March 22, 2002, the Bogans filed the instant federal action, claiming damages as a result of the defendants' inspection and post-inspection conduct. The complaint stated claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 for violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as trespass, conversion of real and personal property, invasion of privacy, harassment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the City and individual defendants moved for partial summary judgment. The district judge granted summary judgment for the individual defendants on the &#167; 1983 claim because they were sued only in their official capacities and their presence was not necessary since the City was sued directly. The judge also granted summary judgment for the City on the tort claims on the basis of sovereign immunity. The judge did, however, permit most of the tort claims to proceed against Joyce and the other Inspectional Services employees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> As for the state law claims against Mayor Menino, the judge granted summary judgment on the trespass, conversion, and invasion of privacy claims because the Mayor was not present during the inspection, and on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim because there was no evidence that the Mayor ordered the inspection to cause the Bogans distress.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 10, 2005, the City made the Bogans an offer of judgment under Fed. R.Civ.P. 68 for $50,000, which they rejected. The district judge then ordered the bifurcation of the remaining claims so that the &#167; 1983 claims against the City and the tort claims against Joyce would be tried first. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 42(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 2005, the parties agreed to try the case to a jury before a magistrate judge. After an eight-day trial, the jury found in favor of the Bogans on the &#167; 1983 claim against the City, but found in favor of Joyce on the tort claims. The jury awarded the Bogans a total of $30,000 in damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The defendants then moved to dismiss the remaining tort claims on the ground that any damages award at a second trial would be duplicative because the &#167; 1983 award against the City compensated the Bogans for their entire injury. The magistrate judge agreed and dismissed the remaining claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the Bogans moved for an award of $113,311.50 in attorney's fees and $13,389.33 in costs under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988. The magistrate judge reduced the fee award to $13,264.87 and the cost award to $3,694.84. The judge then entered a final judgment ordering the City to pay the Bogans a total of $46,959.71. The Bogans filed this appeal, raising a series of challenges to rulings made during the pretrial and trial proceedings and to various reductions made in their request for fees and costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans first claim that they were prejudiced by the improper issuance of a protective order preventing them from deposing Mayor Menino. The district judge granted the protective order on the ground that the Bogans had failed to demonstrate that the information they sought from the Mayor was unavailable from other sources. The Bogans contend that they should have been allowed to depose the Mayor because they uncovered evidence that the Mayor directly ordered the inspection of their property. They hypothesize that, if they had been permitted to depose the Mayor, they may have learned that he ordered the search to intimidate them into selling their property to make way for the NDC-sponsored project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court is empowered by Fed.R.Civ.P. 26(c) to grant a protective order from discovery for \"good cause shown.\" Appellate review of such orders is limited. \"We will intervene in [discovery] matters only upon a clear showing of manifest injustice, that is, where the lower court's discovery order was plainly wrong and resulted in substantial prejudice to the aggrieved party.\" <i>Ayala-Gerena v. Bristol Myers-Squibb Co.,</i> 95 F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The need for limited access to high government officials through the discovery process is well established. In <i>United States v. Morgan,</i> 313 U.S. 409, 422, 61 S.Ct. 999, 85 L.Ed. 1429 (1941), the Supreme Court indicated that the practice of calling high ranking government officials as witnesses should be discouraged. Relying on <i>Morgan,</i> other courts have concluded that top executive department officials should not, absent extraordinary circumstances, be called to testify or deposed regarding their reasons for taking official action. <i>Simplex Time Recorder Co. v. Sec'y of Labor,</i> 766 F.2d 575, 586 (D.C.Cir. 1985); <i>see also In re United States (Holder),</i> 197 F.3d 310, 313 (8th Cir.1999); <i>In re FDIC,</i> 58 F.3d 1055, 1060 (5th Cir.1995); <i>In re United States (Kessler),</i> 985 F.2d 510, 512 (11th Cir.1993). This rule is based on the notion that \"[h]igh ranking government officials have greater duties and time constraints than other witnesses\" and that, without appropriate limitations, such officials will spend an inordinate amount of time tending to pending litigation. <i>Kessler,</i> 985 F.2d at 512.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But this limitation is not absolute. Depositions of high ranking officials may be permitted where the official has first-hand knowledge related to the claim being litigated. <i>See Baine v. Gen. Motors Corp.,</i> 141 F.R.D. 332, 335 (M.D.Ala.1991); <i>Church of Scientology of Boston v. IRS,</i> 138 F.R.D. 9, 12 (D.Mass.1990); <i>Cmty. Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Fed. Home Loan Bank Bd.,</i> 96 F.R.D. 619, 621 (D.D.C.1983). However, even in such cases, discovery is permitted only where it is shown that other persons cannot provide the necessary information. <i>Holder,</i> 197 F.3d at 314.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that Mayor Menino is a high ranking government official and therefore is not subject to being deposed absent a demonstrated need. <i>See Marisol v. Giuliani,</i> 1998 WL 132810, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Mar.23, 1998) (treating a mayor as a high ranking government official for purposes of a motion for a protective order from discovery). The question therefore is whether the Bogans established sufficient need to warrant discovery directly from the Mayor. The Bogans rely on evidence that defendant Hanson, one of the Inspectional Services employees, wrote a note on the day of the inspection to the effect that the Mayor's office had received complaints from neighbors about the Bogans' property and that the Mayor had ordered the inspection as a result. They also rely on the fact that the inspection was ordered on the heels of their disclosing to the NDC that the property was being used as a rooming house. The Bogans assert that these strands of evidence support an inference that the Mayor ordered the inspection on a tip from the NDC because of their shared goal to force the Bogans from the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans' argument founders because they did not pursue other sources to obtain relevant information before turning to the Mayor. Hanson testified that she did not recall why she had written that the Mayor had ordered the inspection, and Joyce testified that he ordered the inspection without a directive from the Mayor. Thus, the identity of the City official who ordered the inspection and the reason for the inspection were disputed issues of fact. The Bogans nevertheless failed to purse discovery from other City employees who could have shed light on the Mayor's involvement. In particular, the Bogans did not seek discovery from any of the Mayor's aides. It is certainly likely that at least one of these employees was involved and could have clarified the Mayor's role. It was therefore incumbent on the Bogans to seek information from these individuals before turning to the Mayor. <i>See Alexander v. FBI,</i> 186 F.R.D. 1, 5 (D.D.C.1998) (denying a request for discovery of a high ranking government official because \"there are other avenues of discovery that plaintiffs may purse to establish their theory\"); <i>Marisol A.,</i> 1998 WL 132810, at *4 (granting the mayor a protective order where relevant discovery could be obtained from other city employees). Accordingly, the district judge did not abuse his discretion in issuing a protective order for Mayor Menino because the Bogans had not exhausted other available avenues of discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans also claim that, even on the record as it existed without the additional discovery, summary judgment was improvidently granted on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim against the Mayor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the record in favor of the nonmoving party. <i>See Wolinetz v. Berkshire Life Ins. Co.,</i> 361 F.3d 44, 47 (1st Cir.2004). Summary judgment is appropriately granted where there is no genuine issue as to any material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge granted summary judgment for the Mayor on the ground that there was no evidence that the Mayor ordered the inspection of the Bogans' property for the purpose of inflicting emotional distress. We agree. The note written by Hanson was sufficient to permit a factfinder to conclude that the Mayor ordered the inspection. But there is no evidence that would permit a finding that the Mayor did so to inflict emotional distress on the Bogans. <i>See Conley v. Romeri,</i> 60 Mass.App.Ct. 799, 806 N.E.2d 933, 937 (2004) (stating that to prevail on an infliction of emotional distress claim, the plaintiff must establish \"that the defendant intended to inflict emotional distress, or knew or should have known that emotional distress was the likely result of [the] conduct\"). The note itself stated that the Mayor ordered the inspection because of neighbor complaints about the Bogans' property. The Bogans contend that this reason was false and that the Mayor ordered the inspection because he wanted to force them from the property. This is mere conjecture. <i>See Podiatrist Ass'n, Inc. v. La Cruz De P.R., Inc.,</i> 332 F.3d 6, 17 (1st Cir.2003) (stating that a claim based on \"unsupported conjecture . . . cannot withstand summary judgment\"). The Bogans have not identified evidence of the Mayor's desire to promote the proposed development project by evicting the Bogans or even that the NDC and the Mayor discussed the status of the Bogans' property. Indeed, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the rationale articulated in Hanson's note was pretext. On this record, the district judge correctly found that Mayor Menino was entitled to summary judgment on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans next contest a series of rulings by the magistrate judge excluding the admission of various pieces of evidence at trial, but they have not filed a trial transcript. The party asserting a claim of error maintains the burden of procuring the transcript where a transcript is necessary to decide the claims. <i>See</i> Fed. R.App. P. 10(b); <i>Feliciano-Hill v. Principi,</i> 439 F.3d 18, 23 n. 3 (1st Cir. 2006).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Because the review of evidentiary rulings are typically fact-intensive and an erroneous evidentiary ruling does not require a new trial if harmless, <i>see Rodriguez-Hernandez v. Miranda-Velez,</i> 132 F.3d 848, 855 (1st Cir.1998), the relevant transcripts are essential to meaningful appellate review. Accordingly, \"[c]hallenges to the admission of evidence will not be considered by the Court of Appeals in the absence of a record containing those portions of the transcript on which the appellant relies.\" <i>United States v. Davis,</i> 60 F.3d 1479, 1482 (10th Cir.1995) (internal citation omitted); <i>see Loren v. Sasser,</i> 309 F.3d 1296, 1304 (11th Cir.2002). Because the Bogans have not provided an adequate record to review their evidentiary challenges, we decline to consider them. <i>See Faigin v. Kelly,</i> 184 F.3d 67, 87 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Bogans challenge the magistrate judge's ruling that it was not necessary to try the tort claims against the remaining Inspectional Services employees. They argue that permitting a second trial on these tort claims could result in an award of damages for injuries that they suffered post-inspection, which they contend were not encompassed in the &#167; 1983 award against the City. According to the Bogans, they presented two theories of &#167; 1983 liability against the City, one based on the Fourth Amendment and the other based on the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment claim, they say, was limited to damages arising from the inspection itself, while the Fourteenth Amendment claim encompassed damages arising from the City's post-inspection conduct. The Bogans interpret the modest amount awarded on the &#167; 1983 claim to mean that the jury compensated them for injuries sustained during the inspection but not for post-inspection damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he law abhors duplicative recoveries\"; thus double awards for the same injury are impermissible. <i>Dopp v. HTP Corp.,</i> 947 F.2d 506, 517 (1st Cir. 1991). Compensatory damages in &#167; 1983 cases remedy only actual injuries caused by the violation, and the level of damages is ordinarily determined according to common law tort principles. <i>See Memphis Cmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura,</i> 477 U.S. 299, 313, 106 S.Ct. 2537, 91 L.Ed.2d 249 (1986); <i>Acevedo-Garcia v. Monroig,</i> 351 F.3d 547, 567-68 (1st Cir.2003). Thus, \"[i]f a [&#167; 1983] claim and a state claim arise from the same operative facts, and seek identical relief, an award of damages under both theories will constitute double recovery.\" <i>Mason v. Okla. Tpk. Auth.,</i> 115 F.3d 1442, 1459 (10th Cir.1997) (internal citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge concluded that the Bogans' trial presentation of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment theories was identical &#8212; encompassing both the City's inspection and post-inspection conduct and seeking all damages incurred as a result. Because the Bogans have not provided us with a trial transcript, we have no basis to question the magistrate judge's view of the evidence. We note, however, that this view is consistent with the Bogans' statement at the pretrial conference that <i>all</i> of their claims were based on the same underlying facts. And it is also consistent with the Bogans' acceptance of a verdict form on the &#167; 1983 claim that did not require the jury to distinguish between the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment theories of liability. In these circumstances, the magistrate judge correctly ruled that the jury awarded full compensation to the Bogans, and therefore a subsequent trial on the remaining claims was unwarranted. <i>See Gilmere v. City of Atlanta,</i> 864 F.2d 734, 740-41 (11th Cir. 1989) (holding that the district court properly refused to award damages for state-law tort claims where the jury had awarded damages on &#167; 1983 claims based on identical facts).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We now turn to the Bogans' challenges to the award of fees and costs. We first summarize the magistrate judge's ruling and then consider the Bogans' specific challenges.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988, the fee-shifting statute under which the Bogans were awarded fees for prevailing on their &#167; 1983 claim, a trial court generally should employ the lodestar method to calculate fees. Under this method, a court usually should begin with the attorneys' contemporaneous billing records. <i>Gay Officers Action League v. Puerto Rico,</i> 247 F.3d 288, 295 (1st Cir.2001). The court should then subtract hours that are duplicative, unproductive or excessive and multiply the reasonable hours billed by the prevailing attorney rate in the community. <i>Id.; Lipsett v. Blanco,</i> 975 F.2d 934, 937 (1st Cir. 1992). The resulting amount constitutes the lodestar. After calculating the lodestar, the court may then adjust the award further for any of several reasons, including the quantum of success achieved in the litigation. <i>Coutin v. Young &amp; Rubicam P.R., Inc.,</i> 124 F.3d 331, 337 n. 3 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge employed this method in determining the appropriate fee award. The judge made several reductions from the reasonable hours expended on the litigation, including time accrued prior to the preparation of the Bogans' federal complaint in December 2001, and time spent on claims dismissed at summary judgment that were severable from the successful &#167; 1983 claim. The judge also reduced the billing rate of one of the Bogans' attorneys, Harold Jacobi, from $350 to $300. After accounting for these reductions, the judge calculated a lodestar figure &#8212; not including fees incurred after the Bogans rejected the defendants' Rule 68 offer of judgment, <i>see infra,</i> &#8212; of $26,529.74. The judge then reduced this figure by fifty percent because much of the trial focused on the unsuccessful claims against Joyce, and the ultimate damage award on the &#167; 1983 claim was modest. After all reductions, the judge determined that an award of $13,264.87 in pre-offer fees was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge then considered the Bogans' request for $13,389.33 in costs. As with the award of pre-offer attorney's fees, the judge excluded costs incurred prior to the preparation of the federal complaint and costs related to the unsuccessful severable claims dismissed at summary judgment. The judge also cut otherwise collectable research costs in half in the absence of sufficient information to determine whether these costs were incurred for research related to the successful claims. After making these reductions, the judge calculated that the Bogans were entitled to pre-offer costs of $3,694.84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the Bogans were entitled to a total award of $16,959.71 in pre-offer fees and costs, the magistrate judge considered whether the Bogans were entitled to recover post-offer fees and costs. The judge observed that, under Rule 68, a prevailing party may not receive fees and costs incurred after receiving an offer of judgment, if the judgment finally obtained is worth less than the offer. The judge further observed that, to determine the size of the judgment finally obtained, the court must add the jury verdict to the amount of pre-offer fees and costs awarded. Because the jury verdict of $30,000 plus the pre-offer fees and costs award of $16,959.71 was less than the City's $50,000 offer of judgment, the judge determined that the Bogans were not entitled to an award of post-offer fees and costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A fee award will be upheld unless it constitutes a \"manifest abuse of discretion.\" <i>See Richardson v. Miller,</i> 279 F.3d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.2002). The trial court has \"extremely broad\" discretion in fashioning a fee award. <i>Lipsett,</i> 975 F.2d at 937. \"Because this is so, and because the determination of the extent of a reasonable fee necessarily involves a series of judgment calls, an appellate court is far more likely to defer to the trial court in reviewing fee computations than in many other situations.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans first claim that the magistrate judge abused her discretion by excluding all fees incurred prior to the preparation of their federal complaint in December 2001. From March 1999 through December 2001, the Bogans' counsel litigated the City's conduct in the Massachusetts Housing Court and before the Massachusetts Building Code Appeals Board. The Bogans contend that the time spent litigating before these state tribunals was recoverable under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988 because the state proceedings permitted the Bogans to mitigate the damages available to them in their subsequent &#167; 1983 action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1988 provides that attorney's fees may be awarded \"in any action or proceeding to enforce provisions of &#167; 1983.\" However, fees incurred in proceedings prior to the preparation of the &#167; 1983 complaint are not recoverable, unless the pre-preparation time was \"both useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to advance the civil rights litigation to the stage it reached.\" <i>Webb v. Bd. of Educ.,</i> 471 U.S. 234, 243, 105 S.Ct. 1923, 85 L.Ed.2d 233 (1985). Under this standard, fees incurred in ancillary state proceedings that are necessary to pursue a federal civil rights action are recoverable, <i>e.g., N.Y. Gaslight Club, Inc. v. Carey,</i> 447 U.S. 54, 71, 100 S.Ct. 2024, 64 L.Ed.2d 723 (1980); <i>Exeter-West Greenwich Reg. Sch. Dist. v. Pontarelli,</i> 788 F.2d 47, 51 (1st Cir.1986), while fees incurred during proceedings that are unnecessary for bringing the federal action are not, <i>Webb,</i> 471 U.S. at 241, 105 S.Ct. 1923.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans were not required to pursue remedies in the Massachusetts Housing Court or before the Massachusetts Building Code Appeals Board to proceed against the City under &#167; 1983. Section 1983 contains no exhaustion requirement, and thus the Bogans' federal claim ripened immediately following the City's wrongful conduct. <i>See Patsy v. Fla. Bd. of Regents,</i> 457 U.S. 496, 102 S.Ct. 2557, 73 L.Ed.2d 172 (1982). The results obtained by the Bogans in these state proceedings may have reduced their actual damages, thereby mitigating the damages available to them in the subsequent &#167; 1983 action. <i>See Meyers v. City of Cincinnati,</i> 14 F.3d 1115, 1119 (6th Cir.1994) (stating that a plaintiff has a duty under &#167; 1983 to mitigate damages). But commencing these proceedings was not <i>necessary</i> to bringing their &#167; 1983 claim. If ancillary state proceedings brought to mitigate damages in an eventual &#167; 1983 suit were sufficient to bring all fees incurred in those proceedings within the ambit of &#167; 1988, the limitation established by <i>Webb</i> would be virtually meaningless. After all, most ancillary proceedings to obtain relief from the alleged wrong underlying a &#167; 1983 suit will, if successful, mitigate the damages flowing from that wrong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, <i>Webb</i> itself involved a situation where the ancillary proceeding could have mitigated the damages available to the plaintiff in his subsequent &#167; 1983 action. The <i>Webb</i> plaintiff was terminated from his position as a school teacher and claimed that the dismissal was racially motivated. 471 U.S. at 236, 105 S.Ct. 1923. The plaintiff pursued administrative remedies before the local school board prior to commencing a &#167; 1983 action in federal court. <i>Id.</i> at 236-37, 105 S.Ct. 1923. If the plaintiff had been successful in obtaining relief through the administrative proceeding, his actual damages from the termination would have been reduced. The Court nevertheless held that the fees incurred during the administrative proceeding could not be recovered under &#167; 1988. <i>Id.</i> at 240, 105 S.Ct. 1923. The same rationale governs here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans' second challenge to the fee award concerns the exclusion of time spent litigating claims dismissed at summary judgment which the magistrate judge determined were severable from the &#167; 1983 claim. The Bogans assert that this severability conclusion was an abuse of discretion because all claims arose from the same core of operative facts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[W]ork on an unsuccessful claim cannot be deemed to have been expended in pursuit of the ultimate result achieved . . . and therefore no fee may be awarded for services on the unsuccessful claim.\" <i>Hensley v. Eckerhart,</i> 461 U.S. 424, 435, 103 S.Ct. 1933, 76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983). This rationale for discounting hours spent on unsuccessful claims does not apply, however, where both the successful and unsuccessful claims arose from the same common core of facts or were based on related legal theories. <i>Id.</i> This is so because \"[m]uch of counsel's time will be devoted generally to the litigation as a whole, making it difficult to divide the hours expended on a claim-by-claim basis.\" <i>Id.</i> Thus, fees are appropriately excluded from the lodestar only \"when different claims for relief are not interconnected, that is, when the claims rest on different facts and legal theories.\" <i>Figueroa-Torres v. Toledo-Davila,</i> 232 F.3d 270, 278 (1st Cir.2000) (citing <i>Coutin,</i> 124 F.3d at 339).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge excluded time spent on the claims against the Mayor, the NDC, and Morrison premised on the theory that these defendants acted in concert to intimidate the Bogans by orchestrating the inspection to force them from the property. The salient facts underlying these claims related to the pre-inspection motives and conduct of these actors. In contrast, the award against the City was premised on inspection and post-inspection conduct. Thus, the unsuccessful claims excluded from the lodestar were predicated on facts different from those underlying the meritorious claim, and the magistrate judge did not abuse her discretion in excluding time spent on these unsuccessful claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See Figueroa-Torres,</i> 232 F.3d at 278-79 (holding that fees incurred in litigating dismissed claims against a supervisor, who was not at scene of arrest, were severable from fees incurred litigating successful claim against the arresting officers).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans' final challenge to the lodestar calculation concerns the reduction of Jacobi's billing rate from $350 to $300. A \"district court . . . is not bound by the hourly rate requested by the victor's counsel.\" <i>Phetosomphone v. Allison Reed Group, Inc.,</i> 984 F.2d 4, 8 (1st Cir. 1993). A court may reduce an attorney's hourly rate based on the type of work that attorney performed during the litigation. <i>See Miles v. Sampson,</i> 675 F.2d 5, 9 (1st Cir.1982). In this regard, we have affirmed a reduction in the billable rate of an attorney because the attorney, even though a \"partner,\" assumed \"the role of an associate\" at the trial by performing less complex tasks. <i>O'Rourke v. City of Providence,</i> 235 F.3d 713, 737 (1st Cir. 2001). The magistrate judge reduced Jacobi's fee rate for similar reasons. Even though the Bogans established that a rate of $350 per hour was generally appropriate for an attorney at Jacobi's experience level, the magistrate judge concluded that a $50 reduction was appropriate because Jacobi had \"limited involvement\" in the case and \"was not present at any time during the eight day trial.\" We have no basis for upsetting this assessment of Jacobi's participation nor for questioning the resulting modest reduction in his billing rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to challenging the lodestar calculation, the Bogans object to the additional fifty percent reduction of the fee award based on their limited success at trial. They assert that the reduction for a lack of success was predicated on the same failed claims that the magistrate judge excluded from the lodestar, and therefore the magistrate judge impermissibly double counted the time spent on these failed claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument misunderstands the basis for the further reduction. This reduction was <i>not,</i> as the Bogans posit, to account for the lack of success on the severable claims that were dismissed at summary judgment. The reduction was made to account for the time spent on the failed common law claims against Joyce, which were interconnected with the &#167; 1983 claim (and therefore not excluded from the lodestar) and to reflect the relatively meager size of the jury verdict on the &#167; 1983 claim. Consequently, the Bogans' argument that the magistrate judge twice reduced the fee award based on the severable claims that were dismissed at summary judgment is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the Bogans' more general claim that, aside from double counting, the fifty percent additional reduction was excessive. The Supreme Court has held that a reduction of a fee award beyond the lodestar may be appropriate where the plaintiff is unsuccessful on interrelated claims and ultimately obtains only limited success. <i>See Hensley,</i> 461 U.S. at 436, 103 S.Ct. 1933; <i>Andrade v. Jamestown Hous. Auth.,</i> 82 F.3d 1179, 1191 (1st Cir.1996) (holding that where \"multiple claims are interrelated and a plaintiff has achieved only limited success . . . a court may . . . simply reduce the award to account for the limited success\"). A trial court's determination to reduce a fee award to account for the plaintiff's limited success is entitled to \"great deference.\" <i>Diaz-Rivera v. Rivera-Rodriguez,</i> 377 F.3d 119, 126 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Much of our focus in reviewing a fee award is on assuring that the trial court provides an adequate explanation for its actions. <i>See Wennik v. Polygram Group Dist., Inc.,</i> 304 F.3d 123, 134 (1st Cir. 2002); <i>Coutin,</i> 124 F.3d at 337. Especially where, as here, a fee award is substantially reduced, the trial court is expected to provide a detailed explanation for its action. <i>See Rodriguez-Hernandez,</i> 132 F.3d at 858. The magistrate judge fulfilled this obligation; her careful order delineated in detail the reasons for the fifty percent reduction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> Even were we inclined to be more generous \"if writing on a pristine page,\" <i>Diaz-Rivera,</i> 377 F.3d at 127, the Bogans have not demonstrated an abuse of discretion in ordering a fifty percent reduction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans' last challenge to the award of fees and costs concerns the denial of all fees and costs incurred after the City made its Rule 68 offer of judgment. The parties correctly agree that, under Rule 68, a prevailing party is not permitted to recover fees or costs incurred after an offer of judgment, where the judgment finally obtained is less than the offer. <i>City of Riverside v. Rivera,</i> 477 U.S. 561, 580, 106 S.Ct. 2686, 91 L.Ed.2d 466 (1986). They disagree, however, over the method for calculating the size of the judgment finally obtained. The Bogans contend that the judgment finally obtained includes the actual amount awarded by the jury ($30,000) and the amount of pre-offer attorney's fees and costs that they requested ($63,431.69). The City counters that the judgment finally obtained includes only the jury award and the pre-offer fees and costs actually awarded by the court ($16,959.71).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases support the City's position. Rule 68 provides, in relevant part, that a party defending against a claim may make an offer of judgment, which includes \"costs then accrued.\" If the offer of judgment is rejected and \"the judgment finally obtained\" is less favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay costs incurred after the making of the offer. Fed.R.Civ.P. 68. The \"judgment finally obtained\" under Rule 68 includes the damage award plus pre-offer fees and costs actually awarded. <i>See Scheeler v. Crane Co.,</i> 21 F.3d 791, 793 (8th Cir.1994); <i>Marryshow v. Flynn,</i> 986 F.2d 689, 692 (4th Cir.1993); <i>Grosvenor v. Brienen,</i> 801 F.2d 944, 948 (7th Cir.1986). The Fourth Circuit has cogently explained the rationale for this rule:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 68 requires that a comparison be made between an offer of judgment that includes `costs then accrued' and the `judgment finally obtained'. . . . To make a proper comparison between the offer of judgment and the judgment obtained when determining, for Rule 68 purposes, which is the more favorable, like `judgments' must be evaluated. Because the offer includes costs then accrued, to determine whether the judgment obtained is more favorable . . . the judgment must be defined on the same basis &#8212; verdict plus costs incurred as of the time of the offer of judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Marryshow,</i> 986 F.2d at 692.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans' argument for crediting their request for pre-offer fees and costs, instead of the amount actually awarded by the court, is illogical. If this were the rule, a prevailing party could always evade the Rule 68 bar simply by asking for a sufficiently large fee award so that the judgment finally obtained exceeds the offer. Not surprisingly, there is no caselaw to this effect. <i>See Scheeler,</i> 21 F.3d at 793 (concluding that amount of pre-offer fees and costs credited as part of the \"judgment finally obtained\" included the reasonable fees and costs awarded by the court); <i>Marryshow,</i> 986 F.2d at 692 (same). We therefore conclude that, because the jury award plus the reasonable award of pre-offer fees and costs did not exceed the offer of judgment, the magistrate judge properly declined to award the Bogans post-offer fees and costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans challenged nearly all adverse aspects of this litigation, but, for the reasons discussed, their challenges lack merit.

City of Philadelphia,</i> 983 F.2d 459, 474 (3d Cir.1992) (allowing fees where product of discovery in ancillary proceeding was later used in federal action). The Bogans have not attempted to identify a discrete portion of fees incurred during the ancillary proceedings that were useful and necessary to the &#167; 1983 action. Rather, they seek an award of all fees incurred during the ancillary proceedings. <i>See Webb,</i> 471 U.S. at 241, 105 S.Ct. 1923 (denying the award of all fees incurred during pre-suit administrative proceeding where the plaintiff argued only that all time spent should be included in the &#167; 1988 award).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> The Bogans have not claimed that any particular time entry was incorrectly identified as related to one of the severable, unsuccessful claims</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> We reject the Bogans' argument that the magistrate judge did not adequately consider the societal importance of this litigation in making the fifty-percent reduction.

First, they claim that costs incurred in the taking of a deposition of a trial witness, prior to the preparation of their federal complaint, was improperly excluded because the witness provided testimony at trial that was relevant to the &#167; 1983 claim. Without a trial transcript, we cannot ascertain the subject of the witness' testimony and therefore cannot disturb the exclusion. Second, they contest the exclusion of costs related to the severable, unsuccessful claims dismissed at summary judgment. For the reasons stated above concerning the exclusion of fees, there was also no abuse of discretion in excluding these costs. Finally, they assert that it was an abuse of discretion to reduce research costs by fifty percent. We have reviewed the billing submissions and conclude that there was no abuse of discretion in reducing these costs because the bills do not indicate whether the costs were incurred on research related to the successful claims<i>See Parker v.

The appellants have raised several claims of error, the most important of which concerns circumstances under which a rejected offer of judgment, pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 68, will cut off a prevailing party's entitlement to attorney's fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Albertha Bogan and her three children<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> brought an action against the City, Mayor Thomas Menino, Commissioner of Inspectional Services Kevin Joyce, three Inspectional Services employees,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> the Neighborhood Development Corporation of Grove Hall (NDC), and one of its founding members, Virginia Morrison, claiming violations of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and various torts under Massachusetts law. The plaintiffs alleged that Inspectional Services employees illegally inspected the Bogans' property in the Dorchester section of Boston, at the behest of Mayor Menino, to force them to sell their property in favor of an economic development project spearheaded by the NDC. The defendants claimed that the inspection was ordered because the property was being operated as an illegal rooming house and was in disrepair.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The inspection took place in March 1999 and resulted in the issuance of fifty building code violation citations and a rooming house violation. As a result of the inspection, the City ordered the Bogans to vacate the property and that it be condemned. A few days after the inspection, the City filed a complaint in the Massachusetts Housing Court to enforce the condemnation order. The Bogans resisted the Housing Court complaint and also litigated the validity of the code violation citations before the Massachusetts Building Code Appeals Board. In June 1999, the Housing Court found that the inspection of the Bogans' home was an illegal regulatory search and vacated virtually all of the code violations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Almost three years later, on March 22, 2002, the Bogans filed the instant federal action, claiming damages as a result of the defendants' inspection and post-inspection conduct. The complaint stated claims under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 for violations of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as trespass, conversion of real and personal property, invasion of privacy, harassment, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due course, the City and individual defendants moved for partial summary judgment. The district judge granted summary judgment for the individual defendants on the &#167; 1983 claim because they were sued only in their official capacities and their presence was not necessary since the City was sued directly. The judge also granted summary judgment for the City on the tort claims on the basis of sovereign immunity. The judge did, however, permit most of the tort claims to proceed against Joyce and the other Inspectional Services employees.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> As for the state law claims against Mayor Menino, the judge granted summary judgment on the trespass, conversion, and invasion of privacy claims because the Mayor was not present during the inspection, and on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim because there was no evidence that the Mayor ordered the inspection to cause the Bogans distress.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 10, 2005, the City made the Bogans an offer of judgment under Fed. R.Civ.P. 68 for $50,000, which they rejected. The district judge then ordered the bifurcation of the remaining claims so that the &#167; 1983 claims against the City and the tort claims against Joyce would be tried first. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 42(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 2005, the parties agreed to try the case to a jury before a magistrate judge. After an eight-day trial, the jury found in favor of the Bogans on the &#167; 1983 claim against the City, but found in favor of Joyce on the tort claims. The jury awarded the Bogans a total of $30,000 in damages.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The defendants then moved to dismiss the remaining tort claims on the ground that any damages award at a second trial would be duplicative because the &#167; 1983 award against the City compensated the Bogans for their entire injury. The magistrate judge agreed and dismissed the remaining claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, the Bogans moved for an award of $113,311.50 in attorney's fees and $13,389.33 in costs under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988. The magistrate judge reduced the fee award to $13,264.87 and the cost award to $3,694.84. The judge then entered a final judgment ordering the City to pay the Bogans a total of $46,959.71. The Bogans filed this appeal, raising a series of challenges to rulings made during the pretrial and trial proceedings and to various reductions made in their request for fees and costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans first claim that they were prejudiced by the improper issuance of a protective order preventing them from deposing Mayor Menino. The district judge granted the protective order on the ground that the Bogans had failed to demonstrate that the information they sought from the Mayor was unavailable from other sources. The Bogans contend that they should have been allowed to depose the Mayor because they uncovered evidence that the Mayor directly ordered the inspection of their property.

Mar.23, 1998) (treating a mayor as a high ranking government official for purposes of a motion for a protective order from discovery). The question therefore is whether the Bogans established sufficient need to warrant discovery directly from the Mayor. The Bogans rely on evidence that defendant Hanson, one of the Inspectional Services employees, wrote a note on the day of the inspection to the effect that the Mayor's office had received complaints from neighbors about the Bogans' property and that the Mayor had ordered the inspection as a result. They also rely on the fact that the inspection was ordered on the heels of their disclosing to the NDC that the property was being used as a rooming house. The Bogans assert that these strands of evidence support an inference that the Mayor ordered the inspection on a tip from the NDC because of their shared goal to force the Bogans from the property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans' argument founders because they did not pursue other sources to obtain relevant information before turning to the Mayor. Hanson testified that she did not recall why she had written that the Mayor had ordered the inspection, and Joyce testified that he ordered the inspection without a directive from the Mayor. Thus, the identity of the City official who ordered the inspection and the reason for the inspection were disputed issues of fact. The Bogans nevertheless failed to purse discovery from other City employees who could have shed light on the Mayor's involvement. In particular, the Bogans did not seek discovery from any of the Mayor's aides. It is certainly likely that at least one of these employees was involved and could have clarified the Mayor's role. It was therefore incumbent on the Bogans to seek information from these individuals before turning to the Mayor. <i>See Alexander v. FBI,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 5 (D.D.C.1998) (denying a request for discovery of a high ranking government official because \"there are other avenues of discovery that plaintiffs may purse to establish their theory\"); <i>Marisol A.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">132810</span></span>, at *4 (granting the mayor a protective order where relevant discovery could be obtained from other city employees). Accordingly, the district judge did not abuse his discretion in issuing a protective order for Mayor Menino because the Bogans had not exhausted other available avenues of discovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans also claim that, even on the record as it existed without the additional discovery, summary judgment was improvidently granted on the intentional infliction of emotional distress claim against the Mayor.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> We review the grant of summary judgment de novo, construing the record in favor of the nonmoving party. <i>See Wolinetz v.

We agree. The note written by Hanson was sufficient to permit a factfinder to conclude that the Mayor ordered the inspection. But there is no evidence that would permit a finding that the Mayor did so to inflict emotional distress on the Bogans. <i>See Conley v.

The note itself stated that the Mayor ordered the inspection because of neighbor complaints about the Bogans' property. The Bogans contend that this reason was false and that the Mayor ordered the inspection because he wanted to force them from the property. This is mere conjecture. <i>See Podiatrist Ass'n, Inc. v.

The Bogans have not identified evidence of the Mayor's desire to promote the proposed development project by evicting the Bogans or even that the NDC and the Mayor discussed the status of the Bogans' property. Indeed, there is nothing in the record to suggest that the rationale articulated in Hanson's note was pretext.

They argue that permitting a second trial on these tort claims could result in an award of damages for injuries that they suffered post-inspection, which they contend were not encompassed in the &#167; 1983 award against the City. According to the Bogans, they presented two theories of &#167; 1983 liability against the City, one based on the Fourth Amendment and the other based on the Fourteenth Amendment. The Fourth Amendment claim, they say, was limited to damages arising from the inspection itself, while the Fourteenth Amendment claim encompassed damages arising from the City's post-inspection conduct. The Bogans interpret the modest amount awarded on the &#167; 1983 claim to mean that the jury compensated them for injuries sustained during the inspection but not for post-inspection damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[T]he law abhors duplicative recoveries\"; thus double awards for the same injury are impermissible. <i>Dopp v.

Because the Bogans have not provided us with a trial transcript, we have no basis to question the magistrate judge's view of the evidence. We note, however, that this view is consistent with the Bogans' statement at the pretrial conference that <i>all</i> of their claims were based on the same underlying facts. And it is also consistent with the Bogans' acceptance of a verdict form on the &#167; 1983 claim that did not require the jury to distinguish between the Fourth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendment theories of liability. In these circumstances, the magistrate judge correctly ruled that the jury awarded full compensation to the Bogans, and therefore a subsequent trial on the remaining claims was unwarranted. <i>See Gilmere v.

Under this method, a court usually should begin with the attorneys' contemporaneous billing records. <i>Gay Officers Action League v.

The judge made several reductions from the reasonable hours expended on the litigation, including time accrued prior to the preparation of the Bogans' federal complaint in December 2001, and time spent on claims dismissed at summary judgment that were severable from the successful &#167; 1983 claim. The judge also reduced the billing rate of one of the Bogans' attorneys, Harold Jacobi, from $350 to $300. After accounting for these reductions, the judge calculated a lodestar figure &#8212; not including fees incurred after the Bogans rejected the defendants' Rule 68 offer of judgment, <i>see infra,</i> &#8212; of $26,529.74. The judge then reduced this figure by fifty percent because much of the trial focused on the unsuccessful claims against Joyce, and the ultimate damage award on the &#167; 1983 claim was modest. After all reductions, the judge determined that an award of $13,264.87 in pre-offer fees was reasonable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The magistrate judge then considered the Bogans' request for $13,389.33 in costs. As with the award of pre-offer attorney's fees, the judge excluded costs incurred prior to the preparation of the federal complaint and costs related to the unsuccessful severable claims dismissed at summary judgment. The judge also cut otherwise collectable research costs in half in the absence of sufficient information to determine whether these costs were incurred for research related to the successful claims. After making these reductions, the judge calculated that the Bogans were entitled to pre-offer costs of $3,694.84.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having concluded that the Bogans were entitled to a total award of $16,959.71 in pre-offer fees and costs, the magistrate judge considered whether the Bogans were entitled to recover post-offer fees and costs. The judge observed that, under Rule 68, a prevailing party may not receive fees and costs incurred after receiving an offer of judgment, if the judgment finally obtained is worth less than the offer. The judge further observed that, to determine the size of the judgment finally obtained, the court must add the jury verdict to the amount of pre-offer fees and costs awarded. Because the jury verdict of $30,000 plus the pre-offer fees and costs award of $16,959.71 was less than the City's $50,000 offer of judgment, the judge determined that the Bogans were not entitled to an award of post-offer fees and costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A fee award will be upheld unless it constitutes a \"manifest abuse of discretion.\" <i>See Richardson v.

The trial court has \"extremely broad\" discretion in fashioning a fee award. <i>Lipsett,</i> 975 F.2d at 937. \"Because this is so, and because the determination of the extent of a reasonable fee necessarily involves a series of judgment calls, an appellate court is far more likely to defer to the trial court in reviewing fee computations than in many other situations.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans first claim that the magistrate judge abused her discretion by excluding all fees incurred prior to the preparation of their federal complaint in December 2001.

The Bogans contend that the time spent litigating before these state tribunals was recoverable under 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1988 because the state proceedings permitted the Bogans to mitigate the damages available to them in their subsequent &#167; 1983 action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1988 provides that attorney's fees may be awarded \"in any action or proceeding to enforce provisions of &#167; 1983.\" However, fees incurred in proceedings prior to the preparation of the &#167; 1983 complaint are not recoverable, unless the pre-preparation time was \"both useful and of a type ordinarily necessary to advance the civil rights litigation to the stage it reached.\" <i>Webb v.

In contrast, the award against the City was premised on inspection and post-inspection conduct. Thus, the unsuccessful claims excluded from the lodestar were predicated on facts different from those underlying the meritorious claim, and the magistrate judge did not abuse her discretion in excluding time spent on these unsuccessful claims.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> <i>See Figueroa-Torres,</i> 232 F.3d at 278-79 (holding that fees incurred in litigating dismissed claims against a supervisor, who was not at scene of arrest, were severable from fees incurred litigating successful claim against the arresting officers).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans' final challenge to the lodestar calculation concerns the reduction of Jacobi's billing rate from $350 to $300. A \"district court . . . is not bound by the hourly rate requested by the victor's counsel.\" <i>Phetosomphone v. Allison Reed Group, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"599014\"><a href=\"/opinion/599014/60-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1120-60-empl-prac-dec-p-41982-nenh/\"><span class=\"volume\">984</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir. 1993). A court may reduce an attorney's hourly rate based on the type of work that attorney performed during the litigation. <i>See Miles v.

In this regard, we have affirmed a reduction in the billable rate of an attorney because the attorney, even though a \"partner,\" assumed \"the role of an associate\" at the trial by performing less complex tasks. <i>O'Rourke v. City of Providence,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771503\"><a href=\"/opinion/771503/julia-m-orourke-v-city-of-providence/\"><span class=\"volume\">235</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">713</span></a></span>, 737 (1st Cir. 2001). The magistrate judge reduced Jacobi's fee rate for similar reasons. Even though the Bogans established that a rate of $350 per hour was generally appropriate for an attorney at Jacobi's experience level, the magistrate judge concluded that a $50 reduction was appropriate because Jacobi had \"limited involvement\" in the case and \"was not present at any time during the eight day trial.\" We have no basis for upsetting this assessment of Jacobi's participation nor for questioning the resulting modest reduction in his billing rate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to challenging the lodestar calculation, the Bogans object to the additional fifty percent reduction of the fee award based on their limited success at trial. They assert that the reduction for a lack of success was predicated on the same failed claims that the magistrate judge excluded from the lodestar, and therefore the magistrate judge impermissibly double counted the time spent on these failed claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument misunderstands the basis for the further reduction. This reduction was <i>not,</i> as the Bogans posit, to account for the lack of success on the severable claims that were dismissed at summary judgment. The reduction was made to account for the time spent on the failed common law claims against Joyce, which were interconnected with the &#167; 1983 claim (and therefore not excluded from the lodestar) and to reflect the relatively meager size of the jury verdict on the &#167; 1983 claim. Consequently, the Bogans' argument that the magistrate judge twice reduced the fee award based on the severable claims that were dismissed at summary judgment is without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This leaves the Bogans' more general claim that, aside from double counting, the fifty percent additional reduction was excessive.

The Bogans contend that the judgment finally obtained includes the actual amount awarded by the jury ($30,000) and the amount of pre-offer attorney's fees and costs that they requested ($63,431.69). The City counters that the judgment finally obtained includes only the jury award and the pre-offer fees and costs actually awarded by the court ($16,959.71).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cases support the City's position. Rule 68 provides, in relevant part, that a party defending against a claim may make an offer of judgment, which includes \"costs then accrued.\" If the offer of judgment is rejected and \"the judgment finally obtained\" is less favorable than the offer, the offeree must pay costs incurred after the making of the offer.

To make a proper comparison between the offer of judgment and the judgment obtained when determining, for Rule 68 purposes, which is the more favorable, like `judgments' must be evaluated. Because the offer includes costs then accrued, to determine whether the judgment obtained is more favorable . . . the judgment must be defined on the same basis &#8212; verdict plus costs incurred as of the time of the offer of judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Marryshow,</i> 986 F.2d at 692.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Bogans' argument for crediting their request for pre-offer fees and costs, instead of the amount actually awarded by the court, is illogical. If this were the rule, a prevailing party could always evade the Rule 68 bar simply by asking for a sufficiently large fee award so that the judgment finally obtained exceeds the offer. Not surprisingly, there is no caselaw to this effect. <i>See Scheeler,</i> 21 F.3d at 793 (concluding that amount of pre-offer fees and costs credited as part of the \"judgment finally obtained\" included the reasonable fees and costs awarded by the court); <i>Marryshow,</i> 986 F.2d at 692 (same).

First, they claim that costs incurred in the taking of a deposition of a trial witness, prior to the preparation of their federal complaint, was improperly excluded because the witness provided testimony at trial that was relevant to the &#167; 1983 claim. Without a trial transcript, we cannot ascertain the subject of the witness' testimony and therefore cannot disturb the exclusion. Second, they contest the exclusion of costs related to the severable, unsuccessful claims dismissed at summary judgment. For the reasons stated above concerning the exclusion of fees, there was also no abuse of discretion in excluding these costs. Finally, they assert that it was an abuse of discretion to reduce research costs by fifty percent. We have reviewed the billing submissions and conclude that there was no abuse of discretion in reducing these costs because the bills do not indicate whether the costs were incurred on research related to the successful claims<i>See Parker v.
