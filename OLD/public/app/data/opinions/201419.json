Keisler, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, Civil Division, and Richard M. Evans, Assistant Director,\non brief for respondent.\n\n\n                        January 27, 2005\n\f             LYNCH,        Circuit      Judge.           Luis      Enrique      Galicia\n\n(\"petitioner\")      is     a     gay   man    who    was,     as   a   result   of   his\n\nhomosexuality, both beaten and verbally abused in 1998 by his\n\nneighbors in his home village of Jalapa, Guatemala. He entered the\n\nUnited States illegally later that year, applied for asylum, and\n\nhad a removal hearing (after many continuances) on September 6,\n\n2002.   The Immigration Judge (IJ) that day denied his claims for\n\nasylum and withholding of removal based on claimed persecution\n\nagainst homosexuals, but granted Galicia voluntary departure.                        The\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (BIA) summarily affirmed on February\n\n11, 2004, which, under            Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st\n\nCir. 2003), means that the IJ's decision is the final order for\n\npurposes of the petition for review now before us.\n\n             Petitioner makes two arguments: (1) there was procedural\n\nerror   by    the     IJ    in    excluding         certain    belatedly     proffered\n\ndocumentary evidence, and (2) the IJ's findings were not supported\n\nby   substantial      evidence.          In        support    of   these     arguments,\n\npetitioner's brief cites to extra-record reports, including a 2003\n\nU.S. State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices in\n\nGuatemala.\n\nClaimed Procedural Error\n\n             In order to make out a viable claim of procedural error\n\nin this context, petitioner must show that the exclusion of the\n\ndocumentary evidence was an abuse of discretion by the IJ.                           See\n\n\n                                             -2-\n\fChay-Velasquez v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 751, 756 (8th Cir. 2004)\n\n(upholding IJ's refusal to accept late-filed evidence under abuse\n\nof discretion standard); cf. Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565,\n\n568 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"An immigration judge, like other judicial\n\nofficers, possesses broad (though not uncabined) discretion over\n\nthe conduct of trial proceedings.\").           Inherent in that standard is\n\nthat there must be some prejudice to petitioner.                      See Chay-\n\nVelasquez, 367 F.3d at 756.\n\n            The offer of evidence was made on the day of the hearing,\n\nin violation of both the local rule requiring pre-hearing marking\n\nof exhibits and the IJ's express warning of the need for adherence\n\nto the rule.     The record is also clear that the documents were\n\nincomplete and not in proper format. Moreover, the record does not\n\nreveal why the tender of the evidence was so late.               There was no\n\nabuse of discretion by the IJ in refusing to admit such evidence.\n\nClaimed Lack of Substantial Evidence\n\n            It was petitioner's burden to establish that he met the\n\ncriteria for asylum by establishing that he (1) suffered past\n\npersecution or (2) has a well founded fear of future persecution,\n\nbased on petitioner's race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nparticular social group, or political opinion, and that petitioner\n\nis unable or unwilling to avail him- or herself of the protection\n\nof   that   country   because    of    such   persecution.      See   8   C.F.R.\n\nยง    208.13(a)-(b).     The     IJ    found   his   testimony   and    evidence\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\finsufficient in at least two respects. First, with respect to past\n\npersecution, Galicia did not show that the harassment he suffered\n\nwas by the government or a group the government could not control.\n\nSilva v. Ashcroft, No. 03-2738, 2005 WL 18231 at *5 (1st Cir. Jan.\n\n5, 2005) (\"Action by non-governmental actors can undergird a claim\n\nof persecution only if there is some showing that the alleged\n\npersecutors      are    in    league     with     the   government       or    are   not\n\ncontrollable by the government.\").                The beating he received was by\n\nyoung men, including one he knew from his church, and Galicia made\n\nno effort to contact the authorities or any other group in the\n\ncountry that might be able to help him.                   Second, with respect to\n\nfuture persecution, the IJ concluded that Galicia had not shown he\n\ncould not safely live elsewhere in Guatemala and, thus, had not\n\ndemonstrated that a reasonable person in his position would fear\n\npersecution if returned to Guatemala.               See Mukamusoni v. Ashcroft,\n\n390 F.3d 110, 120 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"[T]o show a well-founded fear\n\nor future persecution,\" an applicant must show \"that [his] fear is\n\nreasonable.\").         As to that, Galicia made no effort to relocate\n\nelsewhere, and he explained this only on the basis that he did not\n\nhave    family   elsewhere.          A   1997     Department      of   State   Country\n\nConditions Report introduced at the hearing by the respondent did\n\nnot    support   Galicia's         claims    of   country-wide     and   government-\n\nsponsored or condoned discrimination against homosexuals.                       We have\n\ncarefully    reviewed        the    record    and   the    IJ's    conclusions       are\n\n\n                                            -4-\n\fsupported by substantial evidence.\n\n              We add one more note.       It was improper for several\n\nreasons for petitioner's counsel to cite the 2003 U.S. State\n\nDepartment Country Report on Human Rights Practices in his brief to\n\nthis court.     This document was not proffered to the IJ or the BIA;\n\nreview by this court is confined to the administrative record. See\n\n8 U.S.C. ยง 1253(b)(4)(A); Mekhoukh v. Ashcroft, 358 F.3d 118, 123\n\n(1st Cir. 2004).     It is true that the report post-dated the removal\n\nproceeding.      But it or similar reports could have been called to\n\nthe attention of the BIA, see Hazzard v. INS, 951 F.2d 435, 440\n\n(1st Cir. 1991), or could have been made the subject of a motion to\n\nreopen, see 8 C.F.R. ยง 1003.2(a), (c).       Perhaps     counsel failed to\n\ntake these steps because the newly cited material does not compel\n\nthe conclusion he seeks.     Indeed, the 2003 State Department report\n\nrefers   to    violence   against   \"homosexual   male    'sex'   workers.\"\n\nCounsel, in citing the report to us, should not have attempted to\n\nmislead the court by omitting the word \"sex\" and referring only to\n\n\"homosexual male workers.\" Petitioner, as we understand it, has\n\nnever claimed he was a \"sex worker.\"\n\n              The IJ and BIA decisions are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",

It is true that the report post-dated the removal proceeding. But it or similar reports could have been called to the attention of the BIA, <i>see Hazzard v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573876\"><a href=\"/opinion/573876/ronald-hazzard-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">951</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span>, 440 (1st Cir.1991), or could have been made the subject of a motion to reopen, <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.2(a), (c). Perhaps counsel failed to take these steps because the newly cited material does not compel the conclusion he seeks. Indeed, the 2003 State Department report refers to violence against \"homosexual male `sex' workers.\" Counsel, in citing the report to us, should not have attempted to mislead the court by omitting the word \"sex\" and referring only to \"homosexual male workers.\" Petitioner, as we understand it, has never claimed he was a \"sex worker.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ and BIA decisions are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    ",
