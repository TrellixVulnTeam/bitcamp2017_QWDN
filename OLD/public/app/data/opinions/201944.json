App. P. 43(c)(2).\n**\n     Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.   Petitioner Farid Belguendouz\n\n(\"petitioner\") appeals the denial of a motion to reconsider by the\n\nBoard of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\").       He argues that the BIA's\n\ndecision was erroneous and an abuse of discretion because his\n\nsubmission of an Immigrant and Naturalization Service (\"INS\")1\n\nfiling receipt for an I-140 Immigrant Petition for an Alien Worker\n\nserved as prima facie evidence that his Application for Alien Labor\n\nCertification had been approved.   Because the BIA's order did not\n\nconstitute an abuse of discretion, we affirm the BIA's decision.\n\n                          I.   Background\n\n          Petitioner is a native and citizen of Algeria.          He\n\nentered the United States on September 29, 1999, as a non-immigrant\n\nvisitor and was authorized to remain in the country until March 28,\n\n2000.   Petitioner overstayed, and on January 16, 2003, the INS\n\nplaced petitioner in removal proceedings.       The INS alleged that\n\npetitioner was removable as an alien who had overstayed a non-\n\nimmigrant visa pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B).\n\n          On May 14, 2003, petitioner failed to appear at his\n\nhearing before the Boston Immigration Court and was ordered removed\n\nin absentia.   Petitioner filed a motion to reopen2 on June 19,\n\n\n1\n    In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement.\nFor simplicity, we refer to the agency as the INS.\n2\n   The Code of Federal Regulations requires that an in absentia\norder entered in removal proceedings \"may be rescinded only upon a\n\n                                -2-\n\f2003, seeking relief in the form of being allowed to apply for\n\nadjustment of status (based on his pending I-140 visa petition) or,\n\nin the alternative, voluntary departure.     Petitioner first argued\n\nthat the in absentia removal order was unjustified because notice\n\nof the hearing was not sent to \"the most recent address provided by\n\nthe alien\" as required by 8 C.F.R. § 1003.26 (\"Written notice to\n\nthe alien shall be considered sufficient for purposes of this\n\nsection if it was provided at the most recent address provided by\n\nthe   alien.\").3   In   the   alternative,   petitioner   argued   that\n\nreopening his case was warranted because of the existence of\n\nexceptional circumstances. See 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23 (b)(4)(ii). The\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\") denied petitioner's motion to reopen on\n\nJuly 9, 2003, finding that petitioner had received adequate notice\n\nof his hearing date and that petitioner's misunderstanding of the\n\n\n\nmotion to reopen filed within 180 days after the date of the order\nof removal if the alien demonstrates that the failure to appear was\nbecause of exceptional circumstances . . . .\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.23\n(b)(4)(ii) (emphasis added). Further, \"no appeal shall lie from an\norder of removal entered in absentia.\" 8 C.F.R. § 1240.15. These\ntwo provisions explain why petitioner did not appeal the removal\norder itself.\n3\n   The Notice to Appear (\"NTA\"), which was personally served upon\npetitioner, notified him that any address change must be reported\nto the Immigration Court by submission of a Form EOIR-33.\nPetitioner apparently misunderstood this requirement and argued\nthat his submission of an AR-11SR change of address form to the INS\nwas sufficient to put the Immigration Court on notice of his new\naddress.   The IJ rejected this argument, stating that \"only a\nnotice of address change provided to the Court pursuant to the\nwarnings contained in the NTA is sufficient to inform the Court of\nthe need to send correspondence to a new address.\"\n\n                                 -3-\n\faddress requirements did not rise to the level of exceptional\n\ncircumstances.    Petitioner timely appealed to the BIA.\n\n           On June 17, 2004, the BIA adopted and affirmed the\n\ndecision of the IJ and dismissed petitioner's appeal. Referring to\n\nmaterials petitioner had submitted to the IJ,4 the BIA stated that\n\n\"even though the respondent's attorney asserts that the respondent\n\nhas an approved labor certification, there is no evidence of this,\n\nnor is there evidence of an approved visa petition.\"5          Given this\n\nlack of evidence, the BIA concluded that petitioner failed to show\n\nhis eligibility for relief from removal since an approved visa\n\npetition is required in order for an alien to apply for adjustment\n\nof status. Petitioner timely filed a motion to reconsider with the\n\nBIA on July 6, 2004, arguing that the BIA erred when it concluded\n\nthat there was no evidence of an approved labor certification in\n\ndenying his motion to reopen. To support his assertion, petitioner\n\nargued that the receipt he received from the INS when he filed an\n\nI-140 Immigrant Petition for an Alien Worker was prima facie\n\nevidence   that   he   was   the   beneficiary   of   an   approved   labor\n\n\n\n4\n   Most significantly, these materials included a filing receipt\nfor Labor Certification and a filing receipt for an I-140 Immigrant\nPetition for an Alien Worker.\n5\n   Petitioner had filed a petition for a visa as a skilled worker\nas outlined in 8 U.S.C. § 1153(b)(3)(A)(I).       In order to be\napproved for this type of visa petition, an alien must first be\napproved for alien labor certification.     Approval of this visa\npetition would have rendered petitioner eligible to apply for\nadjustment of status as a permanent resident. See 8 U.S.C. § 1255.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fcertification.      According   to    petitioner,   an   approved   labor\n\ncertification is required in order to file an I-140 visa petition,\n\nand thus his filing receipt for this petition proves his approved\n\nlabor certification status.\n\n          On September 9, 2004, the BIA denied petitioner's motion\n\nto reconsider stating that petitioner had \"failed to show any error\n\nof fact or law in our previous decision of June 17, 2004, based\n\nupon the record as it existed at that time.\"        The BIA acknowledged\n\npetitioner's newly submitted approved I-140 Immigrant Petition for\n\nan Alien Worker,6 but refused to entertain it as the motion was for\n\nreconsideration.7    The BIA also indicated in a footnote that\n\npetitioner had previously filed a filing receipt for this document\n\nbut not an approval notice.          Additionally, the BIA found that\n\npetitioner had \"not demonstrated any clear error in the Immigration\n\n\n\n\n6\n  The approval notice for this petition is date February 24, 2004.\nThe record does not contain an approval notice for petitioner's\nlabor certification, but petitioner's brief designates the date of\napproval as \"[o]n or about August 20, 2002.\" Petitioner provides\nno explanation why he did not simply submit the labor certification\napproval notice as evidence in support of his motion to reopen.\n7\n   Motions to reconsider deal with errors of fact or law whereas\nmotions to reopen deal with new evidence.         Compare 8 C.F.R.\n§ 1003.2(b)(1) (\"A motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for\nthe motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior\nBoard decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\")\nwith 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (\"A motion to reopen proceedings shall\nstate the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if\nthe motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other\nevidentiary material.\").\n\n                                     -5-\n\fJudge's   factual    findings     concerning      [petitioner's]    failure   to\n\nprovide a current residential address.\"\n\n            In this appeal, petitioner contends that the BIA abused\n\nits discretion when, in denying his motion for reconsideration, it\n\nfailed to treat his I-140 filing receipt as prima facie evidence\n\nthat he was a recipient of an approved labor certification.\n\n                                 II.    Analysis\n\n            Denials of motions to reconsider are reviewed for abuse\n\nof discretion.     Ven v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d 357, 360 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nOf course, any legal error committed by the BIA constitutes abuse\n\nof discretion by definition.           Top Entertainment, Inc. v. Torrejón,\n\n351 F.3d 531, 533 (1st Cir. 2003).            \"The decision to grant or deny\n\na motion to . . . reconsider is within the discretion of the\n\n[BIA],\" 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2 (a), and the BIA's decision \"must be\n\nupheld    unless    it   was    made    without    a   rational    explanation,\n\ninexplicably departed from established policies, or rested on an\n\nimpermissible basis.\"          Ven, 386 F.3d at 360 (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).\n\n            The sole issue before this court is whether the BIA\n\nabused its discretion in denying petitioner's motion to reconsider\n\nits denial of petitioner's motion to reopen.8                 To the extent\n\n\n8\n  Petitioner devotes his brief to establishing abuse of discretion\nbased on the BIA's failure to consider the I-140 filing receipt as\nprima facie evidence of approved labor certification. We therefore\nconsider waived any argument that the BIA erred in its additional\nconclusion in its September 9 order that petitioner did not\n\n                                        -6-\n\fpetitioner is arguing the BIA abused its discretion by failing to\n\nconsider his filing receipt argument at all, we believe that the\n\nfootnote in its September 9 order sufficiently indicates that the\n\nBIA considered, and rejected, petitioner's argument that his I-140\n\nfiling receipt is sufficient proof of labor certification approval.\n\nSee Lasprilla v. Ashcroft, 365 F.3d 98, 100 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"We\n\nhave found nothing in the regulations that requires the BIA to\n\nexplain its reasons when deciding a motion to reconsider.\").\n\n            Even if petitioner's argument were characterized as one\n\nthat the BIA erred as a matter of law by refusing to construe an I-\n\n140 filing receipt as prima facie evidence of an approved labor\n\ncertification, that argument too fails.       Petitioner correctly\n\npoints out that labor certification is required for an alien to\n\nultimately be eligible for classification as a skilled worker. See\n\n8 C.F.R. § 204.5(l)(3)(I).   However, we think it imprudent to rely\n\non the filing receipt for an I-140 visa petition as conclusive\n\nevidence that something which is required for the ultimate grant of\n\nthat petition exists, and petitioner has not met his burden of\n\nproof in convincing us otherwise.      One obvious reason for our\n\nposition is the possibility that a filed petition could later be\n\nrejected for being improperly filed due to lack of a required\n\ndocument.    At most, the I-140 filing receipt could have been a\n\n\n\ndemonstrate any clear error in the IJ's factual findings concerning\npetitioner's failure to provide a current residential address.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fbasis upon which the BIA inferred the existence of an approved\n\nlabor certification if it chose to exercise its broad discretion in\n\nthat manner.      We see no reason to require this sort of inference\n\nwhen petitioner could have simply submitted evidence of the labor\n\ncertification approval notice, which he claims issued \"on or about\n\nAugust 20, 2002.\"       Petitioner has not adequately explained how the\n\nI-140 filing receipt functions as prima facie evidence of a valid\n\nlabor certification and we are therefore convinced that the BIA did\n\nnot   abuse    its   discretion       by    denying   petitioner's   motion   to\n\nreconsider.\n\n              Because   the   BIA's    denial    of   petitioner's   motion   to\n\nreconsider was not made without a rational explanation, did not\n\ninexplicably depart from established policies, or rest on an\n\nimpermissible basis, the decision of the BIA is affirmed.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\f",

Compare 8 C.F.R.\n§ 1003.2(b)(1) (\"A motion to reconsider shall state the reasons for\nthe motion by specifying the errors of fact or law in the prior\nBoard decision and shall be supported by pertinent authority.\")\nwith 8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1) (\"A motion to reopen proceedings shall\nstate the new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if\nthe motion is granted and shall be supported by affidavits or other\nevidentiary material.\").\n\n                                     -5-\n\fJudge's   factual    findings     concerning      [petitioner's]    failure   to\n\nprovide a current residential address.\"\n\n            In this appeal, petitioner contends that the BIA abused\n\nits discretion when, in denying his motion for reconsideration, it\n\nfailed to treat his I-140 filing receipt as prima facie evidence\n\nthat he was a recipient of an approved labor certification.\n\n                                 II.

Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200975\"><a href=\"/opinion/200975/lasprilla-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">98</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100 (1st Cir. 2004) (\"We\n\nhave found nothing in the regulations that requires the BIA to\n\nexplain its reasons when deciding a motion to reconsider.\").\n\n            Even if petitioner's argument were characterized as one\n\nthat the BIA erred as a matter of law by refusing to construe an I-\n\n140 filing receipt as prima facie evidence of an approved labor\n\ncertification, that argument too fails.       Petitioner correctly\n\npoints out that labor certification is required for an alien to\n\nultimately be eligible for classification as a skilled worker. See\n\n8 C.F.R. § 204.5(l)(3)(I).   However, we think it imprudent to rely\n\non the filing receipt for an I-140 visa petition as conclusive\n\nevidence that something which is required for the ultimate grant of\n\nthat petition exists, and petitioner has not met his burden of\n\nproof in convincing us otherwise.      One obvious reason for our\n\nposition is the possibility that a filed petition could later be\n\nrejected for being improperly filed due to lack of a required\n\ndocument.    At most, the I-140 filing receipt could have been a\n\n\n\ndemonstrate any clear error in the IJ's factual findings concerning\npetitioner's failure to provide a current residential address.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fbasis upon which the BIA inferred the existence of an approved\n\nlabor certification if it chose to exercise its broad discretion in\n\nthat manner.      We see no reason to require this sort of inference\n\nwhen petitioner could have simply submitted evidence of the labor\n\ncertification approval notice, which he claims issued \"on or about\n\nAugust 20, 2002.\"       Petitioner has not adequately explained how the\n\nI-140 filing receipt functions as prima facie evidence of a valid\n\nlabor certification and we are therefore convinced that the BIA did\n\nnot   abuse    its   discretion       by    denying   petitioner's   motion   to\n\nreconsider.\n\n              Because   the   BIA's    denial    of   petitioner's   motion   to\n\nreconsider was not made without a rational explanation, did not\n\ninexplicably depart from established policies, or rest on an\n\nimpermissible basis, the decision of the BIA is affirmed.\n\n              Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -8-\n\f</pre>",
