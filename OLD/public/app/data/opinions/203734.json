Jay A. García Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n\n           Torruella, Siler*, and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n          Jane Lee for appellant.\n          Julia M. Meconiates with whom Rosa Emilia Rodríguez-\nVélez, United States Attorney, and Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant\nUnited States Attorney, were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                              March 24, 2009\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          SILER,    Circuit   Judge.        Pursuant   to   a    written      plea\n\nagreement, Appellant Joel Merced-Rodríguez and his co-defendant\n\npled guilty to one count of aiding and abetting each other in the\n\noffense of carjacking under 18 U.S.C. § 2119.          He was sentenced to\n\na term of 141 months.       Despite signing a plea agreement with an\n\nappeal-waiver provision, he appeals, arguing that there was an\n\ninsufficient factual basis establishing that he had the intent to\n\ninflict serious bodily harm to effectuate the carjacking.                For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n          The    relevant   facts    were    summarized     in    the    factual\n\nstipulation accompanying the plea agreement:\n\n     On September 10, 2005 at approximately 1:30PM, the\n     defendant along with another individual attempted to take\n     by force, violence and/or intimidation a motor vehicle\n     from NLF, while she was parking her vehicle, a 2001 Honda\n     CR-V, license plate EEK-823 at the Santa Maria Shopping\n     Center in Guaynabo, PR. As the victim was exiting her\n     vehicle, the defendant approached her and grabbed her by\n     the shoulder and stated “this is a holdup”, the defendant\n     then grabbed the victim’s handbag and keys to her motor\n     vehicle.   The defendant was unable to take the motor\n     vehicle due to a locking device that the victim had just\n     placed in the steering wheel of the vehicle. At this\n     time the victim began to scream and the defendant along\n     with the other individual attempted to flee the scene but\n     were arrested nearby.\n\n          Merced-Rodríguez     was     indicted,   along        with    his   co-\n\ndefendant, on two counts of aiding and abetting each other in\n\ncarjacking.     The indictment alleged the offenses occurred on two\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fseparate occasions, involving different victims and cars, within a\n\nspan of four days.\n\n            On August 1, 2006, Merced-Rodríguez signed an agreement\n\nunder   Rule    11(c)(1)(B),    pleading      guilty   to    Count    Two   of   the\n\nindictment for the September 10 incident.                 The agreement stated\n\nthat the government would request Count One be dismissed if the\n\nparties recommended a sentence of 141 months.                 That sentence was\n\nwithin the range the parties agreed to submit as the advisory\n\nguidelines range.       The plea agreement contained an appeal-waiver\n\nprovision      that   stated   “if    this    Honorable     Court    accepts     this\n\nagreement and sentences him according to its terms and conditions,\n\ndefendant waives and surrenders his right to appeal the judgment\n\nand sentence in this case.”\n\n            A change-of-plea hearing was held on August 1, 2006.                  On\n\nNovember 3, 2006, the district court held a sentencing hearing and\n\nsentenced Merced-Rodríguez to 141 months imprisonment.\n\n                                        II.\n\n            We articulated the standards for reviewing appeal-waiver\n\nprovisions in United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nThe defendant must have entered the plea knowingly and voluntarily.\n\nId. at 24.      To evaluate whether the plea meets this standard, the\n\ncourt looks at both the text of the appeal-waiver provision and the\n\nchange-of-plea colloquy.        Id.    We may refuse to honor the waiver if\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fdenying   the   right   to    appeal    would   effect   a   “miscarriage   of\n\njustice.”    Id. at 25.\n\n            Merced-Rodríguez concedes the appeal-waiver provision in\n\nthe agreement was clear.           As to the plea colloquy, under Federal\n\nRule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(N), the court must “inform the\n\ndefendant of, and determine that the defendant understands . . .\n\nthe terms of any plea-agreement provision waiving the right to\n\nappeal or to collaterally attack the sentence.”              Id.   On appeal,\n\n“[t]he focus of this inquiry is to ascertain whether the court’s\n\ninterrogation suffices to ensure that the defendant freely and\n\nintelligently agreed to waive her right to appeal her forthcoming\n\nsentence.”      Teeter, 257 F.3d at 24.          The district court must\n\n“inquire specifically at the change-of-plea hearing into any waiver\n\nof appellate rights.”        Id.\n\n            At the plea hearing, Merced-Rodríguez was represented by\n\ncounsel2 and the district court specifically pointed out the appeal\n\nwaiver, reiterating the text of the provision and making sure\n\nMerced-Rodríguez understood the waiver.           Next, the court stated:\n\n“Are you aware that, depending on the facts the Court finds and the\n\nsentence it imposes, both you and the government may still appeal\n\nthe sentence in this case subject to that whatever?” (Merced-\n\nRodríguez replied “yes.”)          The court explicitly noted the right to\n\n\n     2\n       Merced-Rodríguez had earlier signed the plea agreement and\nthe government had agreed not to pursue another carjacking charge\nin Count One.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fappeal depended on the facts the court finds and the sentence it\n\nimposes.    This is consistent with the conditional language of the\n\nappellate waiver, which stated the right to appeal is waived if the\n\ncourt accepts the agreement and sentences the defendant according\n\nto   its   terms   and   conditions.          The    phrase    “subject   to   that\n\nwhatever,” while not a model of clarity, could reasonably be\n\nunderstood to mean the court was referring to the waiver provision\n\nit just read, and does not negate the waiver.\n\n            We have explicitly disagreed with the Ninth Circuit’s\n\napproach which finds “a blanket assurance about the right to\n\nappeal,    delivered      when    sentence      is    pronounced,     cancels    a\n\npreexisting waiver of appellate rights.”               Id. at 25.      While such\n\nstatements “muddy the water and tend to instill false hope–they do\n\nnot effect a per se nullification of a plea-agreement waiver of\n\nappellate rights.”         Id.    Therefore, the statement here, which\n\nconditioned the right to appeal on the court’s making certain\n\nfindings and imposing the recommended sentence (which it ultimately\n\ndid), cannot serve to negate the waiver.               As we declared in United\n\nStates v. Soto-Cruz, 449 F.3d 258 (1st Cir. 2006), “[T]he district\n\ncourt’s statement about the limited circumstances under which [the\n\ndefendant]    could      appeal   his    sentence       does    not   negate    the\n\nenforceability of his appeal waiver.”               Id. at 261.\n\n            Plea agreements entered into knowingly and voluntarily\n\nare presumptively valid, but the court of appeals may not enforce\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fthe waiver if doing so would work a miscarriage of justice.\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d at 25-26.         In determining what constitutes a\n\n“miscarriage    of    justice,”   we    have      articulated   the   following\n\nconsiderations:\n\n     [T]he clarity of the error, its gravity, its character\n     (e.g., whether it concerns a fact issue, a sentencing\n     guideline, or a statutory maximum), the impact of the\n     error on the defendant, the impact of correcting the\n     error on the government, and the extent to which the\n     defendant acquiesced in the result.\n\nId. at 26.      We noted that the miscarriage-of-justice exception\n\nwould “be applied sparingly and without undue generosity.”                   Id.\n\nHere, Merced-Rodríguez argues there would be a miscarriage of\n\njustice if the waiver is enforced because there was no factual\n\nbasis for the intent element of the crime to which he pled guilty.\n\n          Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(3) requires the\n\ncourt to determine that there is a factual basis for the plea.               Id.\n\n“At its most abecedarian level, the requirement that a guilty plea\n\nmust be supported by an adequate factual basis ensures that the\n\nconduct to which the defendant admits constitutes the crime with\n\nwhich he is charged.”      United States v. Negron-Narvaez, 403 F.3d\n\n33, 37 (1st Cir. 2005).           It is not a test of guilt versus\n\ninnocence—the    court    “need   only       be   persuaded   that    sufficient\n\nevidence exists to permit a reasonable person to reach a finding of\n\nguilt.”   Id.        “The component facts may come either from the\n\ndefendant’s admissions and concessions or from credible evidence\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fproffered by the government and not contradicted by the defendant.”\n\nId.\n\n          Merced-Rodríguez     did    not    present    the   issue    of   an\n\ninsufficient factual basis to the district court and therefore the\n\nstandard of review is plain error.          Id.   To show plain error, he\n\nmust demonstrate that there is error that is plain and that it\n\naffects substantial rights.      If these conditions are met, this\n\ncourt may use its discretion to notice such an error if it\n\n“seriously affect[s] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation\n\nof judicial proceedings.” United States v. Borrero-Acevedo,533 F.3d\n\n11,15 (1st Cir. 2008)(quoting Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S.\n\n461, 467 (1997)) (internal quotation marks omitted, alteration in\n\noriginal).    In the context of an error under Rule 11 of the Federal\n\nRules of Criminal Procedure, to demonstrate that the error affects\n\nsubstantial    rights,   the   defendant      must     show   a    reasonable\n\nprobability that, but for the error, he would not have pled guilty.\n\nUnited States v. Dominguez Benitez, 542 U.S. 74, 76 (2004).\n\n          Here, Merced-Rodríguez argues there were insufficient\n\nfacts to establish that he had the requisite intent to inflict\n\nserious bodily harm under the carjacking statute.                 The Supreme\n\nCourt discussed the mens rea requirement in Holloway v. United\n\nStates, 526 U.S. 1 (1999), finding conditional intent to cause\n\nbodily harm sufficient. “Congress intended to criminalize the more\n\ntypical carjacking carried out by means of a deliberate threat of\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fviolence, rather than just the rare case in which the defendant has\n\nan unconditional intent to use violence regardless of how the\n\ndriver responds to his threat.”         Id. at 3.    In cases where the\n\ndriver surrendered the car without the defendant’s attempting to\n\ninflict or actually inflicting serious bodily harm, the government\n\nwould have to prove that “the defendant would have at least\n\nattempted to seriously harm or kill the driver if that action had\n\nbeen necessary to complete the taking of the car.\"           Id. at 11-12\n\n(emphasis added).      Here, the stipulation of facts provided that\n\n“the defendant approached her and grabbed her by the shoulder and\n\nstated ‘this is a holdup’, the defendant then grabbed the victim’s\n\nhandbag and keys to her motor vehicle . . . .”\n\n           In addition, there is the issue of the gun attributed to\n\nhis co-defendant in the presentence report (“PSR”).               The two\n\ndefendants were indicted and pled guilty to separate counts of\n\n“aiding and abetting” each other in the related offenses.               In\n\nUnited   States   v.   Evans-Garcia,    the   defendant    challenged   the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence of his intent to aid and abet the\n\ncarjacking.   322 F.3d 110, 113 (1st Cir. 2003).          The court noted:\n\n           There is an additional layer in the analysis\n           of [the defendant]’s intent in this case, as\n           the indictment and judgment state that he was\n           an aider and abetter in the offenses. To be\n           liable as an aider and abetter, a defendant\n           must have “consciously shared the principal’s\n           knowledge of the underlying criminal act, and\n           intended to help the principal.”\n\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fId. at 14 (quoting United States v. Otero-Méndez, 273 F.3d 46, 51\n\n(1st Cir. 2001)) (footnote omitted).           Here, the PSR established\n\nMerced-Rodríguez’s co-defendant had a gun, and although the PSR\n\nstated it had a blocked barrel, there is no evidence that Merced-\n\nRodríguez knew that the gun was inoperable.           Therefore, because of\n\nthe framing of his culpability as an aider and abettor, the gun\n\nfurther supports the factual basis that he would have at least\n\nattempted to seriously harm the victim if necessary.               Therefore,\n\nthe district court did not commit plain error in concluding that\n\nthis creates a sufficient factual basis to permit a reasonable\n\nperson to find that, at the moment of demanding the car, Merced-\n\nRodríguez would have at least attempted to seriously harm the\n\nvictim if necessary.\n\n          Merced-Rodríguez argues that under the statute the mens\n\nrea requirement applicable here is intent to cause “serious bodily\n\ninjury” as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1365.          This is incorrect.        The\n\ncarjacking statute describes the intent as “intent to cause death\n\nor serious bodily harm.”     18 U.S.C. § 2119 (emphasis added).           Under\n\nsubsection   (1),   the    maximum    prison   term   is   15    years.    Id.\n\nSubsection (2) elevates the penalty to 25 years if serious bodily\n\ninjury (as defined in § 1365) or death results.            Id.   Although the\n\nindictment   and    part   of   the    plea    agreement    reference      both\n\nsubsections, in the “Maximum Penalty” section of the agreement, it\n\nstates the maximum penalty for the count is 15 years, suggesting\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fMerced-Rodríguez    was   pleading    guilty     to   a   violation    only   of\n\nsubsection (1) and not subsection (2).                Consistent with that,\n\nMerced-Rodríguez was sentenced, pursuant to the agreement, to 141\n\nmonths, which is closer to the 15-year maximum under subsection\n\n(1).\n\n          Because     there   was    a      sufficient    factual     basis   of\n\nconditional intent, enforcing the plea agreement does not work a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.       In addition, the miscarriage of justice\n\nstandard requires this court to assess the character of the error\n\nand the extent to which the defendant acquiesced in the result.\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d at 26.       In this case, Merced-Rodríguez did not\n\nraise the sufficiency of the factual basis before the district\n\ncourt and therefore to the extent review is available, it would be\n\nfor plain error. Under that standard, he would have to demonstrate\n\nhe would not have pled guilty but for the error, which he has\n\nfailed to do.\n\n          AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n                    -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Dissenting).              With due respect\n\nto the well-reasoned opinion of my colleagues in the majority, I am\n\ncompelled to dissent for the reasons hereinafter stated.\n\n            I believe that the district court plainly erred in\n\nfinding a sufficient factual basis to accept the plea agreement.\n\nSpecifically, I question whether a factual basis existed that would\n\nallow the district court to conclude that Merced-Rodríguez had the\n\nrequisite    intent    to    inflict    serious      bodily    harm    under   the\n\ncarjacking statute.          While I recognize that Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(b)(3) does not require a \"test of guilty versus innocence\" or\n\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt, we have made clear that there must\n\nbe   a   \"reasoned   basis    to   believe    that   the   defendant     actually\n\ncommitted the crime to which he is admitting guilt.\" United States\n\nv. Matos-Quiñones, 456 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir. 2006).                   I conclude\n\nthat the instant facts failed to supply the district court with\n\nthis \"reasoned basis.\"\n\n            Although grabbing the victim's shoulder, stating that\n\n\"this is a holdup,\" and then grabbing the victim's handbag and keys\n\ncould    certainly    meet   the   \"force,    violence,       and   intimidation\"\n\nelement of the carjacking statute, the Supreme Court has indicated\n\nthat more is needed to satisfy the specific intent element of the\n\nstatute.     See United States v. Holloway, 526 U.S. 1, 11 (1999)\n\n(\"While an empty threat, or intimidating bluff, would be sufficient\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fto satisfy the latter element, such conduct, standing on its own,\n\nis not enough to satisfy § 2119's specific intent element.\").\n\n               Our cases regarding the factual sufficiency of a plea or\n\nthe evidentiary sufficiency of a conviction in this context have\n\ndetailed far more evidence of an intent to inflict serious bodily\n\nharm,       often   involving   explicit    threats   using   firearms.3   I\n\nacknowledge that the more egregious conduct in those cases does\n\nnot, by itself, make our case distinguishable. However, I disagree\n\nthat the physical assault, Merced-Rodríguez's statement to the\n\nvictim that \"this is a holdup,\" as well as the inoperable gun\n\ntossed by his co-defendant upon fleeing the scene provides the\n\nreasoned basis to show that Merced-Rodríguez intended to inflict\n\nserious bodily harm to effectuate the carjacking.             In my view, the\n\n\n\n        3\n      For example, in Matos-Quiñones, two co-defendants argued that\nthey did not possess the specific intent required by the carjacking\nstatute. 456 F.3d at 14. With respect to one of the defendants,\nthe court concluded that the intent element was satisfied as the\n\"[t]he presence of ammunition, the death threats, and the fact that\nhe eventually did kill the victim, provide[d] a rational basis to\nbelieve that [the defendant] was willing to fire his gun if\nnecessary to steal the car.\" Id. at 21 (emphasis in original).\nThe court explained that \"[t]o take the victim's car, [the\ndefendant] pressed a loaded handgun against the victim's body and\nthreatened the victim with death.\"      Id.    Regarding the other\ndefendant, the court noted that the intent element was met as the\ndefendant \"threatened the victim with a handgun at the moment of\nthe carjacking . . . [and] later demonstrated his willingness to\ninflict violent harm when he struck the victim with his handgun.\"\nId. at 22. See also United States v. Lebrón-Cepeda, 324 F.3d 52,\n57 (1st Cir. 2003) (conditional intent to kill could be inferred as\nto two defendants where one \"placed a loaded and cocked revolver\nagainst [the victim's] head at the inception of the carjacking and\nverbally threatened him\").\n\n                                     -12-\n\ffact that the gun was inoperable, that it was not used in the\n\nthreat, and that Merced-Rodríguez and his co-defendant fled upon\n\nhearing the victim scream –- a reaction quite foreseeable in the\n\ncourse of a carjacking -- indicate Merced-Rodríguez's total lack of\n\nintent to inflict serious bodily harm at the moment of demanding\n\nthe car.\n\n            Even when considering Merced-Rodríguez as an aider or\n\nabettor    responsible   for   his   co-defendant's   inoperable   gun,   I\n\ndisagree that there was a sufficient factual basis for the intent\n\nelement.    Notably, our case law in this context has focused on\n\nevidence from which it could be inferred that the aider and abettor\n\nknew of the gun and that it would be used.4       Here, the stipulated\n\nfacts do not point to any such evidence.\n\n            Because of my concerns regarding the factual basis of the\n\nspecific intent element in this case, I conclude that there was not\n\na reasoned basis to believe that the defendant actually committed\n\nthe crime to which he is admitting guilt.       Thus, I believe this to\n\nbe the rare case where plain error exists.            Applying the plain\n\n\n\n     4\n      See United States v. Otero-Méndez, 273 F.3d 46, 52 (1st Cir.\n2001) (requisite intent found where defendant knew to a \"practical\ncertainty\" that his companion intended serious bodily injury or\ndeath based on the fact that his companions had guns when entering\nhis car and that they shot victim immediately upon exiting\ndefendant's car); United States v. Gandía-Maysonet, 227 F.3d 1, 6-7\n(1st Cir. 2000) (requisite intent found where it was reasonable to\ninfer defendant knew companion carjacker had a gun because they\nobtained the gun together and it could be inferred that defendant\nknew the gun would be fired, as it eventually was).\n\n                                     -13-\n\ferror factors, the district court's error in accepting the plea\n\naffected Merced-Rodríguez's substantial rights because, from my\n\nreading of the record, there was a reasonable probability that he\n\nwould not have pled guilty to the crime had the district court not\n\ncommitted this error.      Also, I conclude that the district court's\n\nerror affected the integrity of the judicial proceedings.\n\n            Finally, and for similar reasons, I believe it would be\n\na miscarriage of justice to enforce the waiver provision contained\n\nin   the   plea   agreement.5   The   clarity   of   the   error   and   its\n\nsignificant impact on Merced-Rodríguez outweighs any prejudice to\n\nthe government and his acquiescence in the result.\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.\n\n\n\n\n      5\n      I note that some of our sister courts have held that it is\nappropriate to review a plea agreement in cases involving factual\ninsufficiency claims of a plea irrespective of whether a defendant\nsigned a waiver of appeal provision. See United States v. Adams,\n448 F.3d 492, 497 (2d Cir. 2006) (stating that despite a waiver\nprovision \"a defendant retains the right to contend that there were\nerrors in the proceedings that led to the acceptance of his plea of\nguilty, and he may argue that the district court failed to satisfy\nthe requirement that there is a factual basis for the plea.\")\n(internal quotation marks omitted); United States v.

Pursuant   to   a    written      plea\n\nagreement, Appellant Joel Merced-Rodríguez and his co-defendant\n\npled guilty to one count of aiding and abetting each other in the\n\noffense of carjacking under 18 U.S.C. § 2119.          He was sentenced to\n\na term of 141 months.       Despite signing a plea agreement with an\n\nappeal-waiver provision, he appeals, arguing that there was an\n\ninsufficient factual basis establishing that he had the intent to\n\ninflict serious bodily harm to effectuate the carjacking.                For the\n\nfollowing reasons, we affirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n          The    relevant   facts    were    summarized     in    the    factual\n\nstipulation accompanying the plea agreement:\n\n     On September 10, 2005 at approximately 1:30PM, the\n     defendant along with another individual attempted to take\n     by force, violence and/or intimidation a motor vehicle\n     from NLF, while she was parking her vehicle, a 2001 Honda\n     CR-V, license plate EEK-823 at the Santa Maria Shopping\n     Center in Guaynabo, PR. As the victim was exiting her\n     vehicle, the defendant approached her and grabbed her by\n     the shoulder and stated “this is a holdup”, the defendant\n     then grabbed the victim’s handbag and keys to her motor\n     vehicle.   The defendant was unable to take the motor\n     vehicle due to a locking device that the victim had just\n     placed in the steering wheel of the vehicle. At this\n     time the victim began to scream and the defendant along\n     with the other individual attempted to flee the scene but\n     were arrested nearby.\n\n          Merced-Rodríguez     was     indicted,   along        with    his   co-\n\ndefendant, on two counts of aiding and abetting each other in\n\ncarjacking.     The indictment alleged the offenses occurred on two\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fseparate occasions, involving different victims and cars, within a\n\nspan of four days.\n\n            On August 1, 2006, Merced-Rodríguez signed an agreement\n\nunder   Rule    11(c)(1)(B),    pleading      guilty   to    Count    Two   of   the\n\nindictment for the September 10 incident.                 The agreement stated\n\nthat the government would request Count One be dismissed if the\n\nparties recommended a sentence of 141 months.                 That sentence was\n\nwithin the range the parties agreed to submit as the advisory\n\nguidelines range.       The plea agreement contained an appeal-waiver\n\nprovision      that   stated   “if    this    Honorable     Court    accepts     this\n\nagreement and sentences him according to its terms and conditions,\n\ndefendant waives and surrenders his right to appeal the judgment\n\nand sentence in this case.”\n\n            A change-of-plea hearing was held on August 1, 2006.                  On\n\nNovember 3, 2006, the district court held a sentencing hearing and\n\nsentenced Merced-Rodríguez to 141 months imprisonment.\n\n                                        II.\n\n            We articulated the standards for reviewing appeal-waiver\n\nprovisions in United States v. Teeter, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199507\"><a href=\"/opinion/199507/united-states-v-teeter/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nThe defendant must have entered the plea knowingly and voluntarily.\n\nId. at 24.      To evaluate whether the plea meets this standard, the\n\ncourt looks at both the text of the appeal-waiver provision and the\n\nchange-of-plea colloquy.        Id.    We may refuse to honor the waiver if\n\n\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fdenying   the   right   to    appeal    would   effect   a   “miscarriage   of\n\njustice.”    Id. at 25.\n\n            Merced-Rodríguez concedes the appeal-waiver provision in\n\nthe agreement was clear.           As to the plea colloquy, under Federal\n\nRule of Criminal Procedure 11(b)(1)(N), the court must “inform the\n\ndefendant of, and determine that the defendant understands . . .\n\nthe terms of any plea-agreement provision waiving the right to\n\nappeal or to collaterally attack the sentence.”              Id.   On appeal,\n\n“[t]he focus of this inquiry is to ascertain whether the court’s\n\ninterrogation suffices to ensure that the defendant freely and\n\nintelligently agreed to waive her right to appeal her forthcoming\n\nsentence.”      Teeter, 257 F.3d at 24.          The district court must\n\n“inquire specifically at the change-of-plea hearing into any waiver\n\nof appellate rights.”        Id.\n\n            At the plea hearing, Merced-Rodríguez was represented by\n\ncounsel2 and the district court specifically pointed out the appeal\n\nwaiver, reiterating the text of the provision and making sure\n\nMerced-Rodríguez understood the waiver.           Next, the court stated:\n\n“Are you aware that, depending on the facts the Court finds and the\n\nsentence it imposes, both you and the government may still appeal\n\nthe sentence in this case subject to that whatever?” (Merced-\n\nRodríguez replied “yes.”)          The court explicitly noted the right to\n\n\n     2\n       Merced-Rodríguez had earlier signed the plea agreement and\nthe government had agreed not to pursue another carjacking charge\nin Count One.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fappeal depended on the facts the court finds and the sentence it\n\nimposes.    This is consistent with the conditional language of the\n\nappellate waiver, which stated the right to appeal is waived if the\n\ncourt accepts the agreement and sentences the defendant according\n\nto   its   terms   and   conditions.          The    phrase    “subject   to   that\n\nwhatever,” while not a model of clarity, could reasonably be\n\nunderstood to mean the court was referring to the waiver provision\n\nit just read, and does not negate the waiver.\n\n            We have explicitly disagreed with the Ninth Circuit’s\n\napproach which finds “a blanket assurance about the right to\n\nappeal,    delivered      when    sentence      is    pronounced,     cancels    a\n\npreexisting waiver of appellate rights.”               Id. at 25.      While such\n\nstatements “muddy the water and tend to instill false hope–they do\n\nnot effect a per se nullification of a plea-agreement waiver of\n\nappellate rights.”         Id.    Therefore, the statement here, which\n\nconditioned the right to appeal on the court’s making certain\n\nfindings and imposing the recommended sentence (which it ultimately\n\ndid), cannot serve to negate the waiver.

Here, the PSR established\n\nMerced-Rodríguez’s co-defendant had a gun, and although the PSR\n\nstated it had a blocked barrel, there is no evidence that Merced-\n\nRodríguez knew that the gun was inoperable.           Therefore, because of\n\nthe framing of his culpability as an aider and abettor, the gun\n\nfurther supports the factual basis that he would have at least\n\nattempted to seriously harm the victim if necessary.               Therefore,\n\nthe district court did not commit plain error in concluding that\n\nthis creates a sufficient factual basis to permit a reasonable\n\nperson to find that, at the moment of demanding the car, Merced-\n\nRodríguez would have at least attempted to seriously harm the\n\nvictim if necessary.\n\n          Merced-Rodríguez argues that under the statute the mens\n\nrea requirement applicable here is intent to cause “serious bodily\n\ninjury” as defined in 18 U.S.C. § 1365.          This is incorrect.        The\n\ncarjacking statute describes the intent as “intent to cause death\n\nor serious bodily harm.”     18 U.S.C. § 2119 (emphasis added).           Under\n\nsubsection   (1),   the    maximum    prison   term   is   15    years.    Id.\n\nSubsection (2) elevates the penalty to 25 years if serious bodily\n\ninjury (as defined in § 1365) or death results.            Id.   Although the\n\nindictment   and    part   of   the    plea    agreement    reference      both\n\nsubsections, in the “Maximum Penalty” section of the agreement, it\n\nstates the maximum penalty for the count is 15 years, suggesting\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fMerced-Rodríguez    was   pleading    guilty     to   a   violation    only   of\n\nsubsection (1) and not subsection (2).                Consistent with that,\n\nMerced-Rodríguez was sentenced, pursuant to the agreement, to 141\n\nmonths, which is closer to the 15-year maximum under subsection\n\n(1).\n\n          Because     there   was    a      sufficient    factual     basis   of\n\nconditional intent, enforcing the plea agreement does not work a\n\nmiscarriage of justice.       In addition, the miscarriage of justice\n\nstandard requires this court to assess the character of the error\n\nand the extent to which the defendant acquiesced in the result.\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d at 26.       In this case, Merced-Rodríguez did not\n\nraise the sufficiency of the factual basis before the district\n\ncourt and therefore to the extent review is available, it would be\n\nfor plain error. Under that standard, he would have to demonstrate\n\nhe would not have pled guilty but for the error, which he has\n\nfailed to do.\n\n          AFFIRMED.\n\n\n\n                    -Dissenting Opinion Follows-\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge (Dissenting).              With due respect\n\nto the well-reasoned opinion of my colleagues in the majority, I am\n\ncompelled to dissent for the reasons hereinafter stated.\n\n            I believe that the district court plainly erred in\n\nfinding a sufficient factual basis to accept the plea agreement.\n\nSpecifically, I question whether a factual basis existed that would\n\nallow the district court to conclude that Merced-Rodríguez had the\n\nrequisite    intent    to    inflict    serious      bodily    harm    under   the\n\ncarjacking statute.          While I recognize that Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n11(b)(3) does not require a \"test of guilty versus innocence\" or\n\nproof beyond a reasonable doubt, we have made clear that there must\n\nbe   a   \"reasoned   basis    to   believe    that   the   defendant     actually\n\ncommitted the crime to which he is admitting guilt.\" United States\n\nv.

I conclude\n\nthat the instant facts failed to supply the district court with\n\nthis \"reasoned basis.\"\n\n            Although grabbing the victim's shoulder, stating that\n\n\"this is a holdup,\" and then grabbing the victim's handbag and keys\n\ncould    certainly    meet   the   \"force,    violence,       and   intimidation\"\n\nelement of the carjacking statute, the Supreme Court has indicated\n\nthat more is needed to satisfy the specific intent element of the\n\nstatute.

However, I disagree\n\nthat the physical assault, Merced-Rodríguez's statement to the\n\nvictim that \"this is a holdup,\" as well as the inoperable gun\n\ntossed by his co-defendant upon fleeing the scene provides the\n\nreasoned basis to show that Merced-Rodríguez intended to inflict\n\nserious bodily harm to effectuate the carjacking.             In my view, the\n\n\n\n        3\n      For example, in Matos-Quiñones, two co-defendants argued that\nthey did not possess the specific intent required by the carjacking\nstatute. 456 F.3d at 14. With respect to one of the defendants,\nthe court concluded that the intent element was satisfied as the\n\"[t]he presence of ammunition, the death threats, and the fact that\nhe eventually did kill the victim, provide[d] a rational basis to\nbelieve that [the defendant] was willing to fire his gun if\nnecessary to steal the car.\" Id. at 21 (emphasis in original).\nThe court explained that \"[t]o take the victim's car, [the\ndefendant] pressed a loaded handgun against the victim's body and\nthreatened the victim with death.\"      Id.    Regarding the other\ndefendant, the court noted that the intent element was met as the\ndefendant \"threatened the victim with a handgun at the moment of\nthe carjacking . . . [and] later demonstrated his willingness to\ninflict violent harm when he struck the victim with his handgun.\"\nId. at 22. See also United States v.

Notably, our case law in this context has focused on\n\nevidence from which it could be inferred that the aider and abettor\n\nknew of the gun and that it would be used.4       Here, the stipulated\n\nfacts do not point to any such evidence.\n\n            Because of my concerns regarding the factual basis of the\n\nspecific intent element in this case, I conclude that there was not\n\na reasoned basis to believe that the defendant actually committed\n\nthe crime to which he is admitting guilt.       Thus, I believe this to\n\nbe the rare case where plain error exists.            Applying the plain\n\n\n\n     4\n      See United States v.
