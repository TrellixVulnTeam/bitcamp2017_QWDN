R. App. P. 43(c)(2), Attorney General Michael B.\nMukasey has been substituted for former Attorney General Alberto R.\nGonzales.\n\f          HOWARD, Circuit Judge. In a removal proceeding before an\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\"), petitioner Aldevino Manuel Leal Santos\n\n(\"Santos\") argued as a defense that he met the requirements for\n\nderivative citizenship because his mother was physically present in\n\nthe United States for the requisite time prior to his birth.    That\n\nargument was rejected by the IJ and by the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (\"BIA\").     The Third Circuit Court of Appeals transferred\n\nthe case, for reasons that will become clear later, to the District\n\nof   Massachusetts    for   fact-finding   on   Santos's   derivative\n\ncitizenship claim.    The district court found that his mother was\n\nnot present for the requisite time, and denied his claim of\n\nderivative citizenship.     Santos now appeals that decision.     We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Santos was born in 1957 in the Azores Islands, Portugal.\n\nHe was convicted in the U.S. District Court for the district of\n\nMassachusetts in 1997 of cocaine distribution, money laundering,\n\nand conspiracy charges, United States v. Santos, No. 96-cr-10231\n\n(D. Mass. Oct. 29, 2001), and subsequently was charged with removal\n\nunder 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(2)(A)(iii), (B)(i).      During his removal\n\nproceedings, Santos argued that he satisfied the requirements for\n\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fderivative citizenship under 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a), as that statute\n\nread in 1957.1\n\n            Under    the   statute,    derivative   citizenship   may   be\n\nconferred upon a person born outside of the United States if the\n\napplicant has at least one parent who is a United States citizen,\n\nand the parent was present in the United States for at least ten\n\nyears prior to the applicant's birth.       At least five of those years\n\nmust have been after the parent's fourteenth birthday.\n\n            Santos claims derivative citizenship through his mother,\n\nFrancelina Augusta Leal Santos (\"Francelina\").           While Santos's\n\nremoval proceedings were pending, the United States Citizenship and\n\nImmigration Services determined Francelina to be a United States\n\ncitizen.2    In order for Santos to be eligible for derivative\n\ncitizenship under 8 U.S.C. § 1401(a) (1957), Francelina must have\n\nspent at least ten years in the United States prior to Santos's\n\nbirth in 1957.      Moreover, five of those years must have been after\n\nFrancelina's fourteenth birthday in January 1941.\n\n            In statements to immigration officials between 2003 and\n\n2005, Francelina indicated that she came to the United States first\n\n\n\n1\n When making derivative citizenship determinations under section\n1401(a), courts \"look to the applicable law in effect at the time\nof appellant's birth\". Tullius v. Albright, 240 F.3d 1317, 1320\n(11th Cir. 2001).\n2\n Francelina was born in the Azores in January 1927, but her mother,\nAurora Augusta Leal (Santos's grandmother), was born in the United\nStates and was a citizen.\n\n                                      -3-\n\fin 1928, returning to the Azores in 1934.         She arrived in the\n\nUnited States again in 1941, returning to the Azores in 1947.      Her\n\ngrandson John Mello, an attorney who is Santos's nephew, testified\n\nbefore the district court that Francelina had described to him her\n\nchildhood years in the United States using the same time frames.\n\nHowever, while the IJ said that Francelina was not \"evasive or\n\nmisleading,\"   her   testimony   was     \"distraught,   confused   and\n\ndistressed\" in that she could not remember in what years her\n\nchildren were born, and that she incorrectly stated that she\n\nherself was born in the United States.3\n\n           Francelina's 1962 visa application to the United States\n\nwas also introduced as evidence.       In response to the question in\n\nthe visa application, \"Since my sixteenth birthday my places of\n\nresidence for six months or more have been . . .\", Francelina\n\nlisted only two addresses, both in the Azores, for the years 1943\n\nto 1962.   Thus, Francelina's and Mello's more recent statements\n\nthat she returned to the Azores in 1947 are inconsistent with the\n\nresponse in her 1962 visa application stating that she lived in the\n\nAzores from 1943 to 1962.\n\n           The IJ in Santos's removal proceedings concluded that\n\nSantos failed to prove that he satisfied the requirements for\n\nderivative citizenship.     The BIA affirmed this ruling; Santos\n\n\n\n3\n Francelina was unable to testify before the district court due to\nill health.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fpetitioned the Third Circuit Court of Appeals for review.                             In\n\nreviewing the BIA decision, the Third Circuit found that there\n\nexisted \"a genuine issue of material fact\" as to whether Santos met\n\nthe requirements for derivative citizenship and transferred the\n\ncase to the District of Massachusetts for fact-finding.                              This\n\nprocedure was pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(5)(B), which provides\n\nfor a transfer to the \"judicial district in which the petitioner\n\nresides\"     for   further     fact-finding.          As        Santos,     previously\n\nincarcerated in Pennsylvania, had already been deported, the Third\n\nCircuit    elected      to   transfer    the   case        to    the      District     of\n\nMassachusetts for the convenience of Francelina, a Massachusetts\n\nresident.4\n\n             In July 2007, the district court held an evidentiary\n\nhearing    on    the    factual   question     of   whether         Francelina        was\n\nphysically present in the United States for the requisite amount of\n\ntime prior to Santos's birth.            Leal Santos v. Gonzales, 495 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 180 (D. Mass. 2007).           The district court concluded that\n\nalthough she had come to the United States twice as a child, she\n\nhad not stayed long enough the second time, after attaining the age\n\nof   fourteen.         Specifically,    the    district          court     found     that\n\n\n\n\n4\n No issue has been raised in this appeal about either the propriety\nof the transfer or whether this is the appropriate court to review\nthe district court's findings. See 28 U.S.C. § 1294(1) (appeals\nfrom reviewable district court decisions shall be in the court of\nappeals for the circuit embracing the district.)\n\n                                        -5-\n\fFrancelina was in the United States from 1928 to 1934, and from\n\n1941 to 1943.    Santos now appeals to this court.\n\n                                 II.\n\n          We review the district court's legal conclusions de novo.\n\nJaneiro v. Urological Surgery Prof'l Ass'n, 457 F.3d 130, 138 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).     We review the factual determination of the district\n\ncourt as to Santos's eligibility for derivative citizenship under\n\na clearly erroneous standard.    Id.\n\n          Santos argues that the district court incorrectly placed\n\nthe burden of proof on him to show that he met the eligibility\n\nrequirements for derivative citizenship.   In addition, he contends\n\nthat, even if the district court was correct in assigning the\n\nburden of proof to him, the court erred in its interpretation of\n\nthe evidence.5\n\n          First, Santos argues that the government bears the burden\n\nof proving alienage in removal proceedings.    8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(c)\n\n(2007). This is true; however, evidence that the person in removal\n\nproceedings was born abroad meets that burden unless the person can\n\nprove, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that he possesses\n\nderivative citizenship.    See Batista v. Ashcroft, 270 F.3d 8, 15\n\n(1st Cir. 2001); Matter of Tijerina-Villarreal, 13 I. & N. Dec.\n\n327, 330-31 (BIA 1969); see also Scales v. INS, 232 F.3d 1159, 1163\n\n\n\n5\n Santos made several additional arguments before the IJ and BIA,\nwhich he did not raise before this court and has thus waived.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f(9th Cir. 2000).     Thus, we agree with the district court that it\n\nwas Santos's burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat Francelina lived in the United States from 1941 until at least\n\n1946, in addition to spending five years in the United States prior\n\nto age fourteen.\n\n           Santos next argues that he met that burden, as the\n\nevidence shows, in his view, that Francelina remained in the United\n\nStates until 1947.   He contends that the district court came to the\n\nwrong conclusion based on the evidence before it.\n\n           In challenging the district court's conclusion, Santos\n\nargues that the testimony of John Mello corroborated Francelina's\n\nversion of when she was in the United States.             Although some of\n\nFrancelina's statements may have demonstrated confusion, he argues\n\nthat Mello's credible testimony wholly supports her account.\n\n           Santos also argues that the district court gave undue\n\nweight to Francelina's 1962 visa application.             As Francelina is\n\nilliterate in both English and Portugese, he argues, she did not\n\nprepare   the   application   herself    and   it   may   not   be   accurate.\n\nFurther, he argues, the 1962 visa application is ambiguously\n\nworded.    The visa application requires the applicant to list\n\n\"places of residence\" since the applicant's sixteenth birthday.              A\n\nminor's \"residence,\" he argues, can be understood as the home of\n\none's parents.    Here, he suggests, Francelina was a minor between\n\nthe years 1943 and 1946, and may have answered the question to\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\freflect where her parents were living at this time rather than\n\nwhere she herself was living.6\n\n          While   Santos's   interpretation   of    the   evidence   is\n\nadmittedly plausible, the view adopted by the district court --\n\nFrancelina left the United States in 1943 -- is also plausible.\n\nDue to her inability to recall dates, the district court found\n\nFrancelina's testimony before the IJ unreliable with respect to the\n\nprecise years she had been in the United States as a child.          In\n\ncontrast, the district court did credit Francelina's statements in\n\nthe visa application, which was completed several decades closer to\n\nthe material time periods and, as the district court noted, \"at a\n\ntime when the stakes were not yet known.\"          We cannot find the\n\ndistrict court's choice between two plausible interpretations of\n\nthe facts to be clearly erroneous.     United States v. Weidul, 325\n\nF.3d 50, 53 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n6\n Santos makes a final attack on the district court's conclusion\nwith an appeal to historical context.      He suggests that it is\nunlikely that Francelina would have crossed the Atlantic Ocean in\n1943, during World War II, to return to the Azores. In response,\nwe note first there is nothing on the record to suggest that the\ndistrict court's finding is clearly erroneous. Further, even if\nSantos were able to show that Francelina could only have returned\nto the Azores after the conclusion of World War II in 1945, that is\nstill insufficient to prove that he met the requirements for\nderivative citizenship.     Again, he must show that Francelina\nremained in the United States until at least 1946.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

Urological Surgery Prof'l Ass'n, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">130</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 138 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).     We review the factual determination of the district\n\ncourt as to Santos's eligibility for derivative citizenship under\n\na clearly erroneous standard.    Id.\n\n          Santos argues that the district court incorrectly placed\n\nthe burden of proof on him to show that he met the eligibility\n\nrequirements for derivative citizenship.   In addition, he contends\n\nthat, even if the district court was correct in assigning the\n\nburden of proof to him, the court erred in its interpretation of\n\nthe evidence.5\n\n          First, Santos argues that the government bears the burden\n\nof proving alienage in removal proceedings.    8 C.F.R. § 1240.8(c)\n\n(2007). This is true; however, evidence that the person in removal\n\nproceedings was born abroad meets that burden unless the person can\n\nprove, by a fair preponderance of the evidence, that he possesses\n\nderivative citizenship.    See Batista v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775402\"><a href=\"/opinion/775402/cesar-batista-v-john-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 15\n\n(1st Cir. 2001); Matter of Tijerina-Villarreal, 13 I. & N. Dec.\n\n327, 330-31 (BIA 1969); see also Scales v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771183\"><a href=\"/opinion/771183/stanley-russell-scales-jr-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1163\n\n\n\n5\n Santos made several additional arguments before the IJ and BIA,\nwhich he did not raise before this court and has thus waived.\n\n                                 -6-\n\f(9th Cir. 2000).     Thus, we agree with the district court that it\n\nwas Santos's burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat Francelina lived in the United States from 1941 until at least\n\n1946, in addition to spending five years in the United States prior\n\nto age fourteen.\n\n           Santos next argues that he met that burden, as the\n\nevidence shows, in his view, that Francelina remained in the United\n\nStates until 1947.   He contends that the district court came to the\n\nwrong conclusion based on the evidence before it.\n\n           In challenging the district court's conclusion, Santos\n\nargues that the testimony of John Mello corroborated Francelina's\n\nversion of when she was in the United States.             Although some of\n\nFrancelina's statements may have demonstrated confusion, he argues\n\nthat Mello's credible testimony wholly supports her account.\n\n           Santos also argues that the district court gave undue\n\nweight to Francelina's 1962 visa application.             As Francelina is\n\nilliterate in both English and Portugese, he argues, she did not\n\nprepare   the   application   herself    and   it   may   not   be   accurate.\n\nFurther, he argues, the 1962 visa application is ambiguously\n\nworded.    The visa application requires the applicant to list\n\n\"places of residence\" since the applicant's sixteenth birthday.              A\n\nminor's \"residence,\" he argues, can be understood as the home of\n\none's parents.    Here, he suggests, Francelina was a minor between\n\nthe years 1943 and 1946, and may have answered the question to\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\freflect where her parents were living at this time rather than\n\nwhere she herself was living.6\n\n          While   Santos's   interpretation   of    the   evidence   is\n\nadmittedly plausible, the view adopted by the district court --\n\nFrancelina left the United States in 1943 -- is also plausible.\n\nDue to her inability to recall dates, the district court found\n\nFrancelina's testimony before the IJ unreliable with respect to the\n\nprecise years she had been in the United States as a child.          In\n\ncontrast, the district court did credit Francelina's statements in\n\nthe visa application, which was completed several decades closer to\n\nthe material time periods and, as the district court noted, \"at a\n\ntime when the stakes were not yet known.\"          We cannot find the\n\ndistrict court's choice between two plausible interpretations of\n\nthe facts to be clearly erroneous.     United States v. Weidul, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200401\"><a href=\"/opinion/200401/united-states-v-weidul/\"><span class=\"volume\">325</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 53 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n6\n Santos makes a final attack on the district court's conclusion\nwith an appeal to historical context.      He suggests that it is\nunlikely that Francelina would have crossed the Atlantic Ocean in\n1943, during World War II, to return to the Azores. In response,\nwe note first there is nothing on the record to suggest that the\ndistrict court's finding is clearly erroneous. Further, even if\nSantos were able to show that Francelina could only have returned\nto the Azores after the conclusion of World War II in 1945, that is\nstill insufficient to prove that he met the requirements for\nderivative citizenship.     Again, he must show that Francelina\nremained in the United States until at least 1946.\n\n                                 -8-\n\f</pre>",
