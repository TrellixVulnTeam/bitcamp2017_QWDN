ANDERSON,\n\n                        Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n            APPEAL FORM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                      FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n\n             [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                Before\n\n              Campbell and Bowman,* Senior Circuit Judges,\n                       and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Edward E. Eliot on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n                            June 29, 2006\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           LIPEZ,    Circuit    Judge.         Appellant    Paul      M.    Anderson\n\nchallenges   his    sentence    after    pleading    guilty      to    charges      of\n\ndistributing and possessing with intent to distribute cocaine and\n\ncocaine base.      The district court sentenced Anderson to 57 months\n\nin prison, with concurrent terms of four years of supervised\n\nrelease, and a $600 mandatory penalty.             Anderson argues that the\n\ndistrict court erred by applying a two-level sentencing enhancement\n\nfor firearm possession under the sentencing guidelines.                      He also\n\nchallenges his sentence under United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220\n\n(2005), which was decided after the court sentenced Anderson.\n\nWhile we reject his argument that there was error in the court's\n\napplication of a guidelines enhancement, we remand his case for re-\n\nsentencing   under    Booker.     The        government    had   the       burden   of\n\ndemonstrating that the application of the mandatory sentencing\n\nguidelines by the district court was harmless error.                   It has not\n\ndone so.\n\n                                        I.\n\n           On November 14, 2003, a confidential informant told drug\n\nagents that Anderson had agreed to sell the informant cocaine at\n\nAnderson's house later that day. The agents followed the informant\n\nto Anderson's house, where Anderson sold him cocaine.                       Over the\n\nnext four weeks, the informant made several additional controlled\n\nbuys of cocaine and crack cocaine from Anderson in his house.                       On\n\nJanuary 7, 2004, agents searched Anderson's house pursuant to a\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fwarrant    and   seized   several   baggies,   each   of   which    contained\n\ncocaine.    During the search, agents also seized a loaded Smith and\n\nWesson 9mm semi-automatic handgun, found in the living room along\n\nwith a ledger recording money owed to Anderson.                    The agents\n\narrested Anderson.\n\n            On August 26, 2004, Anderson appeared in district court\n\nand pled guilty to a six-count indictment.            Counts I through III\n\nand VI charged him with distributing and possessing with intent to\n\ndistribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and\n\n841(b)(1)(C).     Counts IV and V alleged distribution and possession\n\nwith intent to distribute more than 5 grams of cocaine base in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 841 (b)(1)(B).\n\n            The pre-sentence investigation report (\"PSI\") found a\n\nbase offense level of 28 and a Criminal History of I.          The PSI then\n\nrecommended a two-level reduction for the defendant's acceptance of\n\nresponsibility and reported that the government would recommend a\n\nfurther one-level reduction.        The PSI also recommended a two-level\n\nenhancement for firearm possession.        The PSI recommended against a\n\n\"safety valve\" reduction.      The total adjusted offense level in the\n\nPSI was 27, yielding an initial guidelines sentencing range of 70-\n\n87 months.\n\n            The PSI also noted that Anderson and his mother stated\n\nthat Anderson had been dealing with serious mental health problems\n\nsince childhood.     While on pretrial supervision, Anderson met with\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fDr. Jeremy Spiegel, a psychiatrist, who observed symptoms of\n\nmultiple   anxiety    disorders,      including       obsessive-compulsive\n\ndisorder, panic disorder with agoraphobia, anxiety, and social\n\nanxiety.   The PSI noted that Anderson might request a downward\n\ndeparture based on his mental health problems.\n\n           Anderson   objected   to      the   PSI.     He   disputed   the\n\nrecommended two-level firearm enhancement, stating that the gun was\n\nnot used in connection with the crime because \"this firearm was\n\npurchased as personal protection after a series of armed home\n\ninvasions in Sanford, Maine in late 2000.\"        He also argued that his\n\npossession of a gun did not preclude the benefits of the \"safety\n\nvalve\" reduction.\n\n           At the sentencing hearing, the government agreed that the\n\ndefendant would be eligible for the safety valve reduction because,\n\nit stated, \"[the prosecution] would have to provide the court with\n\nsome evidence that the gun was used in connection with the offense,\n\nwhich [the prosecution] ha[s] no such evidence.\"             The district\n\ncourt applied the two-level safety valve reduction.\n\n           The government then argued that, notwithstanding the\n\napplication of the safety valve reduction, the two-level firearm\n\nenhancement should apply. The defendant challenged the application\n\nof the enhancement, arguing that, under Blakely v. Washington, 542\n\nU.S. 296 (2004), the government had to prove that the gun was\n\nactually connected with the offense in order for the firearm\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fenhancement to apply.   Therefore, according to the defendant, the\n\nenhancement was inapplicable because the government stated that it\n\ncould not prove this fact.         The district court disagreed and\n\napplied the enhancement.\n\n          The   defendant   also   asked   the   district   court   for   a\n\ndownward departure on the basis of his serious mental health\n\nproblems. The district court noted that the Guidelines discouraged\n\ndepartures on the basis of mental health unless the facts took the\n\ncase outside of the \"heartland\" of other cases involving defendants\n\nwith mental health problems.        After carefully considering the\n\nfacts, the district court noted that \"[i]t's unfortunately the case\n\nthat Mr. Anderson's condition is not outside the heartland\" and\n\nthat, although his condition was serious and severe, the court\n\n\"see[s] a number of severe or serious mental health issues.\"\n\n          The district court calculated a final offense level of\n\n25, yielding a guidelines sentencing range of 57-71 months.           The\n\ndistrict court imposed a sentence of 57 months in prison, with\n\nconcurrent terms of four years of supervised release, and a $600\n\nmandatory penalty.   The judge stated that the crime \"deserves the\n\npunishment that is being imposed,\" and noted that the sentence, at\n\nthe bottom of the guidelines range, was \"a legitimate and adequate\n\nsentence.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f                                     II.\n\n           Anderson raises two main arguments on appeal.         First, he\n\nargues that the district court improperly applied the two-level\n\nfirearm sentencing enhancement under the United States Sentencing\n\nGuidelines      Manual    (\"U.S.S.G.\")     §   2D1.1(b)(1).    Second,     he\n\nchallenges his sentence in the wake of Booker, where the Supreme\n\nCourt held that the guidelines must be treated as advisory rather\n\nthan mandatory.     We address his arguments in turn.\n\nA.   Application of the Firearm Sentencing Enhancement\n\n           We    review    a   district   court's   interpretation   of   the\n\nguidelines de novo and its factual findings for clear error.\n\nUnited States v. Robinson, 433 F.3d 31, 35, 38 (1st Cir. 2005).            In\n\nthis case, the district court applied a two-level sentencing\n\nenhancement for firearm possession under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1),\n\nnoting that the defendant acknowledged that the police had found a\n\nloaded handgun in his apartment, and that the defendant stated that\n\nhe bought the gun for \"personal protection after a series of armed\n\nhome invasions\" in his area.         The court also applied a two-level\n\nreduction under the \"safety valve\" provision of U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2.\n\nThe defendant and the prosecution agreed that the provision was\n\napplicable, despite its requirement that the defendant show that he\n\nwas not in possession of the firearm in connection with the\n\noffense.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f            The   defendant      argues   that,    because    the    government\n\nconceded that the safety valve applies, the district court erred in\n\napplying the two-level sentencing enhancement for gun possession.\n\nThe district court found nothing contradictory about applying both\n\nthe    enhancement   and   the   reduction,   concluding      that    different\n\nstandards apply for each.\n\n            We agree with the district court.                The burdens for\n\nestablishing the applicability of the safety valve reduction and\n\nthe weapon enhancement are different.         Section 5C1.2, the \"safety\n\nvalve\" provision, permits a two-level reduction in offense level if\n\nthe defendant and the offense meet certain enumerated criteria.\n\nSee United States v. McLean, 409 F.3d 492, 500 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nPertinent to this case, \"the safety valve is unavailable to a\n\ndefendant who 'possesses a firearm . . . in connection with the\n\noffense.'\"    Id. (quoting U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2).             Thus, the defendant\n\nhas the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,\n\nthat he did not possess the firearm in connection with the offense.\n\nSee United States v. Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517, 529 n.25 (1st\n\nCir. 1996).\n\n            Section 2D1.1(b)(1) permits a two-level enhancement \"[i]f\n\na dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\" To garner\n\nthis    enhancement,   the    government    has     the   initial    burden   of\n\nestablishing \"that a firearm possessed by the defendant was present\n\nduring the commission of the offense.\"            United States v. McDonald,\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\f121 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir. 1997).       Once the government has made that\n\nshowing, \"the burden shifts to the defendant to persuade the\n\nfactfinder that a connection between the weapon and the crime is\n\nclearly improbable.\"      Id. (emphasis added); see also U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2D1.1(b)(1), cmt. n.3 (\"The adjustment should be applied if the\n\nweapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon\n\nwas connected with the offense.\").\n\n           Thus, the burden on the defendant is different for these\n\ntwo sentencing provisions.      The application of the safety valve\n\n(which requires the defendant to establish by a preponderance of\n\nthe evidence that he did not possess the firearm in connection with\n\nthe offense) does not necessarily mean that the defendant can meet\n\nthe heavier burden, once the government shows that the firearm was\n\npresent during the commission of the offense, of establishing that\n\nit was clearly improbable that the gun was used in connection with\n\nthe offense.\n\n           Other courts have addressed similar arguments regarding\n\nthe interaction of the safety valve adjustment under § 5C1.2 and\n\nthe   firearm   enhancement   under   §   2D1.1(b)(1).1   At   least   two\n\n\n1\n    We have previously held, in the co-conspirator liability\ncontext, that \"any automatic equation of the possession of a\nfirearm by another and unavailability of the safety valve is\nmistaken.\" United States v. Figueroa-Encarnacion, 343 F.3d 23, 35\n(1st Cir. 2003) (concluding that a co-conspirator's firearm\npossession may not be attributable to the defendant for purposes of\ndetermining the applicability of the safety valve); see also United\nStates v. Zavalza-Rodriguez, 379 F.3d 1182, 1187 (10th Cir. 2004)\n(same).    Because the basis for responsibility in these co-\n\n                                  -8-\n\fcircuits   have   concluded   that    the   application   of   a   firearm\n\nenhancement under § 2D1.1(b) does not necessarily preclude a safety\n\nvalve reduction under § 5C1.2.2        See United States v. Bolka, 355\n\nF.3d 909, 915 (6th Cir. 2004) (noting the different burdens of\n\nproof under the two sentencing provisions); United States v.\n\nNelson, 222 F.3d 545, 551 (9th Cir. 2000) (same).         In other words,\n\nthese courts held that the defendant's failure to meet the higher\n\nburden of proof set forth in the firearm enhancement provision of\n\nthe guidelines did not necessarily preclude the defendant from\n\nmeeting the lower burden of proof set forth in the safety valve\n\nreduction provision.\n\n           In support of his position that the application of the\n\nsafety valve reduction precludes the application of the firearm\n\nenhancement in his case, Anderson relies primarily on United States\n\nv. Vasquez, 161 F.3d 909 (5th Cir. 1998).        In Vasquez, the Fifth\n\nCircuit stated that \"§ 2D1.1(b)(1) and § 5C1.2(2) . . . should be\n\n\nconspirator liability cases differs from the case presented here,\nhowever, we do not base our holding on this precedent.\n2\n    The district court in both of those cases held that the\napplication   of   the  firearm   enhancement   during   sentencing\nautomatically precluded the defendant from receiving a safety valve\nreduction. Thus, the question on appeal in those cases was whether\nthe district court erred in automatically precluding the defendants\nfrom the safety valve reduction. That question differs from what\nwe are considering here -- whether the application of the safety\nvalve reduction in Anderson's case should have automatically\nprecluded the application of the firearm enhancement. However, the\ndiscussion of the differing burdens for the safety valve reduction\nand firearm enhancement provisions in those cases is helpful for\nour analysis.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fanalyzed analogously.\"      Id. at 912.    However, the Fifth Circuit's\n\ndescription of the government's burden under § 2D1.1(b)(1) differs\n\nfrom the analysis of that burden in our precedent.             The Fifth\n\nCircuit states that \"[t]he government has the burden of proof under\n\n§ 2D1.1 of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that a\n\ntemporal and spatial relation existed between the weapon, the drug\n\ntrafficking activity, and the defendant.\" Id. (internal quotation\n\nmarks and citation omitted).       By contrast, as explained above, we\n\nhave held that the government must show that a firearm was present\n\nduring the commission of an offense.       The burden then shifts to the\n\ndefendant to show that it is clearly improbable that the gun was\n\nused in connection with the offense.          Because of these differing\n\napproaches, the Fifth Circuit's reasoning is inapplicable in this\n\ncase.     See Nelson, 222 F.3d at 550 n.3 (distinguishing Vasquez\n\nbased on its different approach to the burden under § 2D1.1(b)(1)).\n\n            We thus discern no legal error in the district court's\n\napplication of the firearm enhancement given its acceptance of the\n\nsafety valve reduction.         Nor were the district court's findings\n\nrelated    to   the   firearm   enhancement   clearly   erroneous.   The\n\ndefendant conceded that there was a loaded gun in the home in which\n\nhe sold drugs.    On that basis alone, the government met its burden\n\nof establishing that the gun was present at the commission of the\n\noffense.    See McDonald, 121 F.3d at 10 (\"[T]he prosecution need\n\nonly prove that the defendant possessed the weapon during the\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fcurrency of the offense, not necessarily that he actually used it\n\nin perpetrating the crime or that he intended to do so.\").   In his\n\nobjection to the PSI and during sentencing, defense counsel argued\n\nonly that Anderson bought the gun after a series of home invasions\n\ntook place in his area.      This fact does not establish that a\n\nconnection between the weapon and the crime is clearly improbable.\n\nSee United States v. Corcimiglia, 967 F.2d 724, 727 (1st Cir. 1992)\n\n(\"[W]hen the weapon's location makes it readily available to\n\nprotect either the participants themselves during the commission of\n\nillegal activity or the drugs and cash involved in the drug\n\nbusiness, there will be sufficient evidence to connect the weapons\n\nto the offense conduct.\").     Thus, we discern no error in the\n\ndistrict court's application of the sentencing enhancement.3\n\n\n3\n   Anderson also appears to challenge the district court's\napplication of the firearm sentencing enhancement under Booker.\nSpecifically, he argues that his concession that he had a loaded\ngun in his home does not amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt\nthat the gun was used in connection with the offense.          This\nchallenge is a non-starter.        Booker does not require the\ngovernment, in an advisory guidelines system, to assume burdens\nthat are allocated to the defendant under the guidelines, or change\nthe applicable burden from preponderance of the evidence to proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. See United States v. Yeje-Cabrera, 430\nF.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[T]he Booker error is not that a judge\n(by a preponderance of the evidence) determined facts under the\nGuidelines which increased a sentence beyond that authorized by the\njury verdict or an admission by the defendant; the error is only\nthat the judge did so in a mandatory Guidelines system.\"(internal\nquotation marks omitted)); United States v. Pérez-Ruiz, 421 F.3d\n11, 14-15 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"Under the 5-4 constitutional ruling in\nBooker, judge-made enhancements under the guidelines that result in\na sentence greater than the sentence that could be imposed based\nsolely on the facts found by the jury do amount to Sixth Amendment\nviolations if the guidelines are treated as mandatory; but under\n\n                               -11-\n\fB.    Booker error\n\n            The parties agree that Anderson preserved his Booker\n\nclaim by raising a Blakely argument in the district court.4 See\n\nUnited States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(\"The argument that a Booker error occurred is preserved if the\n\ndefendant below argued Apprendi or Blakely error or that the\n\nGuidelines were unconstitutional.\").         We thus review his preserved\n\nBooker claim for harmless error.         United States v. Benedetti, 433\n\nF.3d 111, 119 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            The government has the burden of establishing that the\n\npreserved Booker error was harmless. See United States v. Vázquez-\n\nRivera, 407 F.3d 476, 489 (1st Cir. 2005).           \"The standard of proof,\n\nhowever,    depends   on    whether    the   error    is   conceived   of   as\n\nconstitutional.\"      Id.   If the error is constitutional in nature,\n\n\"the government has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat the error did not affect the defendant's substantial rights.\"\n\nId.    If the error is not constitutional in nature, the government\n\n\nthe companion 5-4 remedial ruling in Booker, this problem is washed\nout by treating the guidelines as advisory. A defendant sentenced\nunder the mandatory regime may be entitled to re-sentencing under\nthe advisory one . . . but Booker both created and cured the\nconstitutional error at the same time.\").\n4\n   Specifically, the government stated in its brief that, \"[i]n\nthis case, although Anderson's argument below is different from the\none he makes on appeal, the record shows that the court and the\nparties were keenly aware of Booker's predecessor, Blakely v.\nWashington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004).     As a result, the Government\nagrees that Anderson's appellate claim was preserved and will\nshoulder the burden of demonstrating that any error was harmless.\"\n\n                                      -12-\n\fhas the burden of demonstrating the absence of any \"grave doubt\"\n\nregarding the harmlessness of the error.      See id.      In the Booker\n\ncontext, we have explained that constitutional error exists \"where\n\na mandatory Guidelines sentence was imposed on the basis of judge-\n\nfound facts,\" in violation of the Sixth Amendment.         Id.       We have\n\nnot previously decided \"whether Booker error arising out of the\n\nmandatory    application   of   the   Guidelines   alone    .    .    .    is\n\nconstitutional in nature.\" Id. at 490 n.7.\n\n            In this case, the government acknowledged that it has the\n\ndifficult burden of proving harmless error, but it did not specify\n\nwhich specific standard is applicable. Because the government only\n\nhad the burden at sentencing of establishing the presence of the\n\ngun for the firearm enhancement, and Anderson conceded that his gun\n\nwas present in his home where the drug buys occurred, it is\n\narguable that the Booker error in this case involves only the\n\nmandatory application of the guidelines.      However, regardless of\n\nwhether such an error is constitutional, we conclude that the\n\ngovernment has not met its burden of proving harmless error.              The\n\ngovernment argues that \"nothing in the record suggests that, given\n\na chance to reflect again, the lower court would select anything\n\nother than the 57-month term it chose initially.\"       To support this\n\nassertion, the government points to the judge's statements during\n\nsentencing that the crime \"deserves the punishment that is being\n\nimposed,\" and that the sentence was \"a legitimate and adequate\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fsentence.\"      However, the government fails to account for the\n\ndistrict     court's    consideration   and   discussion   of   Anderson's\n\n\"serious mental health issues,\" presented in support of his request\n\nfor a downward departure.\n\n           In addressing this request, the district court correctly\n\nnoted that the guidelines discourage departures on the basis of\n\nmental health problems unless the facts take the case outside of\n\nthe \"heartland\" of other cases involving defendants with mental\n\nhealth problems.       See, e.g., United States v. Maldonado-Montalvo,\n\n356 F.3d 65, 74 (1st Cir. 2003) (explaining that, under the\n\nguidelines, \"departures based upon a defendant's mental condition\n\nare discouraged, which means that the sentencing court must first\n\nmake a finding that the mental condition is extraordinary or\n\natypical\" (internal citations omitted)); United States v. Studley,\n\n907 F.2d 254, 258 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"[The guidelines] specifically\n\nstate[] that defendant's mental or emotional conditions are not\n\nordinarily relevant.       If they are to be considered, the district\n\ncourt must expressly find that the defendant's particular mental or\n\nemotional condition is 'atypical.'\" (emphasis omitted)).               Our\n\nprecedent has been \"stringent in distinguishing between serious\n\nmental health problems and a truly 'extraordinary' case\" under the\n\nguidelines.    United States v. Derbes, 369 F.3d 579, 583 (1st Cir.\n\n2004); see also Maldonado-Montalvo, 356 F.3d at 74              (concluding\n\nthat defendant's \"severe or major depression\" did not rise to the\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\flevel    of    \"extraordinary\"      and   thus    did   not    warrant    downward\n\ndeparture).\n\n               After    carefully   considering      the   facts     presented   on\n\nAnderson's mental health history, the court found that \"[i]t's\n\nunfortunately the case that Mr. Anderson's condition is not outside\n\nthe heartland\" and that, although his condition was serious and\n\nsevere, the court \"see[s] a number of severe or serious mental\n\nhealth issues.\"         This is a classic mandatory guidelines analysis.\n\n               Taking into account the heavy burden of the government to\n\nestablish      harmless    error,   we    must    question     the     government's\n\nassertion that the district court would not sentence Anderson more\n\nleniently in a post-Booker world.              We have explained that, \"under\n\nthe advisory guidelines scheme set in place by Booker, a sentencing\n\ncourt    will     ordinarily    begin     by     calculating     the    applicable\n\nguidelines range and then determine whether other factors 'warrant\n\nan ultimate sentence above or below the guideline range.'\"                    United\n\nStates v.

Anderson challenges his sentence after pleading guilty to charges of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base. The district court sentenced Anderson to 57 months in prison, with concurrent terms of four years of supervised release, and a $600 mandatory penalty. Anderson argues that the district court erred by applying a two-level sentencing enhancement for firearm possession under the sentencing guidelines. He also challenges his sentence under <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), which was decided after the court sentenced Anderson. While we reject his argument that there was error in the court's application of a guidelines enhancement, we remand his case for re-sentencing under <i>Booker.</i> The government had the burden of demonstrating that the application of the mandatory sentencing guidelines by the district court was harmless error. It has not done so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 14, 2003, a confidential informant told drug agents that Anderson had agreed to sell the informant cocaine at Anderson's house later that day. The agents followed the informant to Anderson's house, where Anderson sold him cocaine. Over the next four weeks, the informant made several additional controlled buys of cocaine and crack cocaine from Anderson in his house. On January 7, 2004, agents searched Anderson's house pursuant to a warrant and seized several baggies, each of which contained cocaine. During the search, agents also seized a loaded Smith and Wesson 9mm semi-automatic handgun, found in the living room along with a ledger recording money owed to Anderson. The agents arrested Anderson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 26, 2004, Anderson appeared in district court and pled guilty to a six-count indictment. Counts I through III and VI charged him with distributing and possessing with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C). Counts IV and V alleged distribution and possession with intent to distribute more than 5 grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pre-sentence investigation report (\"PSI\") found a base offense level of 28 and a Criminal History of I. The PSI then recommended a two-level reduction for the defendant's acceptance of responsibility and reported that the government would recommend a further one-level reduction. The PSI also recommended a two-level enhancement for firearm possession. The PSI recommended against a \"safety valve\" reduction. The total adjusted offense level in the PSI was 27, yielding an initial guidelines sentencing range of 70-87 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSI also noted that Anderson and his mother stated that Anderson had been dealing with serious mental health problems since childhood. While on pretrial supervision, Anderson met with Dr. Jeremy Spiegel, a psychiatrist, who observed symptoms of multiple anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder with agoraphobia, anxiety, and social anxiety. The PSI noted that Anderson might request a downward departure based on his mental health problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson objected to the PSI. He disputed the recommended two-level firearm enhancement, stating that the gun was not used in connection with the crime because \"this firearm was purchased as personal protection after a series of armed home invasions in Sanford, Maine in late 2000.\" He also argued that his possession of a gun did not preclude the benefits of the \"safety valve\" reduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the government agreed that the defendant would be eligible for the safety valve reduction because, it stated, \"[the prosecution] would have to provide the court with some evidence that the gun was used in connection with the offense, which [the prosecution] ha[s] no such evidence.\" The district court applied the two-level safety valve reduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then argued that, notwithstanding the application of the safety valve reduction, the two-level firearm enhancement should apply. The defendant challenged the application of the enhancement, arguing that, under <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the government had to prove that the gun was actually connected with the offense in order for the firearm enhancement to apply. Therefore, according to the defendant, the enhancement was inapplicable because the government stated that it could not prove this fact. The district court disagreed and applied the enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant also asked the district court for a downward departure on the basis of his serious mental health problems. The district court noted that the Guidelines discouraged departures on the basis of mental health unless the facts took the case outside of the \"heartland\" of other cases involving defendants with mental health problems. After carefully considering the facts, the district court noted that \"[i]t's unfortunately the case that Mr. Anderson's condition is not outside the heartland\" and that, although his condition was serious and severe, the court \"see[s] a number of severe or serious mental health issues.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court calculated a final offense level of 25, yielding a guidelines sentencing range of 57-71 months. The district court imposed a sentence of 57 months in prison, with concurrent terms of four years of supervised release, and a $600 mandatory penalty. The judge stated that the crime \"deserves the punishment that is being imposed,\" and noted that the sentence, at the bottom of the guidelines range, was \"a legitimate and adequate sentence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson raises two main arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the district court improperly applied the two-level firearm sentencing enhancement under the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\"U.S.S.G.\") &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1). Second, he challenges his sentence in the wake of <i>Booker,</i> where the Supreme Court held that the guidelines must be treated as advisory rather than mandatory. We address his arguments in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Application of the Firearm Sentencing Enhancement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's interpretation of the guidelines <i>de novo</i> and its factual findings for clear error. <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 433 F.3d 31, 35, 38 (1st Cir.2005). In this case, the district court applied a two-level sentencing enhancement for firearm possession under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1), noting that the defendant acknowledged that the police had found a loaded handgun in his apartment, and that the defendant stated that he bought the gun for \"personal protection after a series of armed home invasions\" in his area. The court also applied a two-level reduction under the \"safety valve\" provision of U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2. The defendant and the prosecution agreed that the provision was applicable, despite its requirement that the defendant show that he was not in possession of the firearm in connection with the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argues that, because the government conceded that the safety valve applies, the district court erred in applying the two-level sentencing enhancement for gun possession. The district court found nothing contradictory about applying both the enhancement and the reduction, concluding that different standards apply for each.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court. The burdens for establishing the applicability of the safety valve reduction and the weapon enhancement are different. Section 5C1.2, the \"safety valve\" provision, permits a two-level reduction in offense level if the defendant and the offense meet certain enumerated criteria. <i>See United States v. McLean,</i> 409 F.3d 492, 500 (1st Cir.2005). Pertinent to this case, \"the safety valve is unavailable to a defendant who `possesses a firearm . . . in connection with the offense.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2). Thus, the defendant has the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he did not possess the firearm in connection with the offense. <i>See United States v. Miranda-Santiago,</i> 96 F.3d 517, 529 n. 25 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2D1.1(b)(1) permits a two-level enhancement \"[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\" To garner this enhancement, the government has the initial burden of establishing \"that a firearm possessed by the defendant was present during the commission of the offense.\" <i>United States v. McDonald,</i> 121 F.3d 7, 10 (1st Cir.1997). Once the government has made that showing, \"the burden shifts to the defendant to persuade the factfinder that a connection between the weapon and the crime is clearly improbable.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added); <i>see also</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1), cmt. n. 3 (\"The adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the burden on the defendant is different for these two sentencing provisions. The application of the safety valve (which requires the defendant to establish by a <i>preponderance of the evidence</i> that he did not possess the firearm in connection with the offense) does not necessarily mean that the defendant can meet the heavier burden, once the government shows that the firearm was present during the commission of the offense, of establishing that it was <i>clearly improbable</i> that the gun was used in connection with the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts have addressed similar arguments regarding the interaction of the safety valve adjustment under &#167; 5C1.2 and the firearm enhancement under &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> At least two circuits have concluded that the application of a firearm enhancement under &#167; 2D1.1(b) does not necessarily preclude a safety valve reduction under &#167; 5C1.2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See United States v. Bolka,</i> 355 F.3d 909, 915 (6th Cir.2004) (noting the different burdens of proof under the two sentencing provisions); <i>United States v. Nelson,</i> 222 F.3d 545, 551 (9th Cir.2000) (same). In other words, these courts held that the defendant's failure to meet the higher burden of proof set forth in the firearm enhancement provision of the guidelines did not necessarily preclude the defendant from meeting the lower burden of proof set forth in the safety valve reduction provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his position that the application of the safety valve reduction precludes the application of the firearm enhancement in his case, Anderson relies primarily on <i>United States v. Vasquez,</i> 161 F.3d 909 (5th Cir.1998). In <i>Vasquez,</i> the Fifth Circuit stated that \"&#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) and &#167; 5C1.2(2) . . . should be analyzed analogously.\" <i>Id.</i> at 912. However, the Fifth Circuit's description of the government's burden under &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) differs from the analysis of that burden in our precedent. The Fifth Circuit states that \"[t]he government has the burden of proof under &#167; 2D1.1 of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that a temporal and spatial relation existed between the weapon, the drug trafficking activity, and the defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). By contrast, as explained above, we have held that the government must show that a firearm was present during the commission of an offense. The burden then shifts to the defendant to show that it is clearly improbable that the gun was used in connection with the offense. Because of these differing approaches, the Fifth Circuit's reasoning is inapplicable in this case. <i>See Nelson,</i> 222 F.3d at 550 n. 3 (distinguishing <i>Vasquez</i> based on its different approach to the burden under &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus discern no legal error in the district court's application of the firearm enhancement given its acceptance of the safety valve reduction. Nor were the district court's findings related to the firearm enhancement clearly erroneous. The defendant conceded that there was a loaded gun in the home in which he sold drugs. On that basis alone, the government met its burden of establishing that the gun was present at the commission of the offense. <i>See McDonald,</i> 121 F.3d at 10 (\"[T]he prosecution need only prove that the defendant possessed the weapon during the currency of the offense, not necessarily that he actually used it in perpetrating the crime or that he intended to do so.\"). In his objection to the PSI and during sentencing, defense counsel argued only that Anderson bought the gun after a series of home invasions took place in his area. This fact does not establish that a connection between the weapon and the crime is clearly improbable. <i>See United States v. Corcimiglia,</i> 967 F.2d 724, 727 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"[W]hen the weapon's location makes it readily available to protect either the participants themselves during the commission of illegal activity or the drugs and cash involved in the drug business, there will be sufficient evidence to connect the weapons to the offense conduct.\"). Thus, we discern no error in the district court's application of the sentencing enhancement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Booker</i> error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that Anderson preserved his <i>Booker</i> claim by raising a <i>Blakely</i> argument in the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir.2005) (\"The argument that a <i>Booker</i> error occurred is preserved if the defendant below argued <i>Apprendi</i> or <i>Blakely</i> error or that the Guidelines were unconstitutional.\"). We thus review his preserved <i>Booker</i> claim for harmless error. <i>United States v. Benedetti,</i> 433 F.3d 111, 119 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government has the burden of establishing that the preserved <i>Booker</i> error was harmless. <i>See United States v. V&#225;zquez-Rivera,</i> 407 F.3d 476, 489 (1st Cir.2005). \"The standard of proof, however, depends on whether the error is conceived of as constitutional.\" <i>Id.</i> If the error is constitutional in nature, \"the government has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the defendant's substantial rights.\" <i>Id.</i> If the error is not constitutional in nature, the government has the burden of demonstrating the absence of any \"grave doubt\" regarding the harmlessness of the error. <i>See id.</i> In the <i>Booker</i> context, we have explained that constitutional error exists \"where a mandatory Guidelines sentence was imposed on the basis of judge-found facts,\" in violation of the Sixth Amendment. <i>Id.</i> We have not previously decided \"whether <i>Booker</i> error arising out of the mandatory application of the Guidelines alone ... is constitutional in nature.\" <i>Id.</i> at 490 n. 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the government acknowledged that it has the difficult burden of proving harmless error, but it did not specify which specific standard is applicable. Because the government only had the burden at sentencing of establishing the presence of the gun for the firearm enhancement, and Anderson conceded that his gun was present in his home where the drug buys occurred, it is arguable that the <i>Booker</i> error in this case involves only the mandatory application of the guidelines. However, regardless of whether such an error is constitutional, we conclude that the government has not met its burden of proving harmless error. The government argues that \"nothing in the record suggests that, given a chance to reflect again, the lower court would select anything other than the 57-month term it chose initially.\" To support this assertion, the government points to the judge's statements during sentencing that the crime \"deserves the punishment that is being imposed,\" and that the sentence was \"a legitimate and adequate sentence.\" However, the government fails to account for the district court's consideration and discussion of Anderson's \"serious mental health issues,\" presented in support of his request for a downward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing this request, the district court correctly noted that the guidelines discourage departures on the basis of mental health problems unless the facts take the case outside of the \"heartland\" of other cases involving defendants with mental health problems. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Maldonado-Montalvo,</i> 356 F.3d 65, 74 (1st Cir.2003) (explaining that, under the guidelines, \"departures based upon a defendant's mental condition are discouraged, which means that the sentencing court must first make a finding that the mental condition is extraordinary or atypical\" (internal citations omitted)); <i>United States v. Studley,</i> 907 F.2d 254, 258 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[The guidelines] specifically state[] that defendant's mental or emotional conditions are not ordinarily relevant. If they are to be considered, the district court must expressly find that the defendant's particular mental or emotional condition is `atypical.'\" (emphasis omitted)). Our precedent has been \"stringent in distinguishing between serious mental health problems and a truly `extraordinary' case\" under the guidelines. <i>United States v.

Anderson challenges his sentence after pleading guilty to charges of distributing and possessing with intent to distribute cocaine and cocaine base. The district court sentenced Anderson to 57 months in prison, with concurrent terms of four years of supervised release, and a $600 mandatory penalty. Anderson argues that the district court erred by applying a two-level sentencing enhancement for firearm possession under the sentencing guidelines. He also challenges his sentence under <i>United States v.

While we reject his argument that there was error in the court's application of a guidelines enhancement, we remand his case for re-sentencing under <i>Booker.</i> The government had the burden of demonstrating that the application of the mandatory sentencing guidelines by the district court was harmless error.

The agents followed the informant to Anderson's house, where Anderson sold him cocaine. Over the next four weeks, the informant made several additional controlled buys of cocaine and crack cocaine from Anderson in his house. On January 7, 2004, agents searched Anderson's house pursuant to a warrant and seized several baggies, each of which contained cocaine. During the search, agents also seized a loaded Smith and Wesson 9mm semi-automatic handgun, found in the living room along with a ledger recording money owed to Anderson. The agents arrested Anderson.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 26, 2004, Anderson appeared in district court and pled guilty to a six-count indictment. Counts I through III and VI charged him with distributing and possessing with intent to distribute cocaine in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(C). Counts IV and V alleged distribution and possession with intent to distribute more than 5 grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 841(b)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pre-sentence investigation report (\"PSI\") found a base offense level of 28 and a Criminal History of I. The PSI then recommended a two-level reduction for the defendant's acceptance of responsibility and reported that the government would recommend a further one-level reduction. The PSI also recommended a two-level enhancement for firearm possession. The PSI recommended against a \"safety valve\" reduction. The total adjusted offense level in the PSI was 27, yielding an initial guidelines sentencing range of 70-87 months.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The PSI also noted that Anderson and his mother stated that Anderson had been dealing with serious mental health problems since childhood. While on pretrial supervision, Anderson met with Dr. Jeremy Spiegel, a psychiatrist, who observed symptoms of multiple anxiety disorders, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder with agoraphobia, anxiety, and social anxiety. The PSI noted that Anderson might request a downward departure based on his mental health problems.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson objected to the PSI. He disputed the recommended two-level firearm enhancement, stating that the gun was not used in connection with the crime because \"this firearm was purchased as personal protection after a series of armed home invasions in Sanford, Maine in late 2000.\" He also argued that his possession of a gun did not preclude the benefits of the \"safety valve\" reduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the sentencing hearing, the government agreed that the defendant would be eligible for the safety valve reduction because, it stated, \"[the prosecution] would have to provide the court with some evidence that the gun was used in connection with the offense, which [the prosecution] ha[s] no such evidence.\" The district court applied the two-level safety valve reduction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government then argued that, notwithstanding the application of the safety valve reduction, the two-level firearm enhancement should apply. The defendant challenged the application of the enhancement, arguing that, under <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span> (2004), the government had to prove that the gun was actually connected with the offense in order for the firearm enhancement to apply. Therefore, according to the defendant, the enhancement was inapplicable because the government stated that it could not prove this fact. The district court disagreed and applied the enhancement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant also asked the district court for a downward departure on the basis of his serious mental health problems. The district court noted that the Guidelines discouraged departures on the basis of mental health unless the facts took the case outside of the \"heartland\" of other cases involving defendants with mental health problems. After carefully considering the facts, the district court noted that \"[i]t's unfortunately the case that Mr. Anderson's condition is not outside the heartland\" and that, although his condition was serious and severe, the court \"see[s] a number of severe or serious mental health issues.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court calculated a final offense level of 25, yielding a guidelines sentencing range of 57-71 months. The district court imposed a sentence of 57 months in prison, with concurrent terms of four years of supervised release, and a $600 mandatory penalty. The judge stated that the crime \"deserves the punishment that is being imposed,\" and noted that the sentence, at the bottom of the guidelines range, was \"a legitimate and adequate sentence.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anderson raises two main arguments on appeal. First, he argues that the district court improperly applied the two-level firearm sentencing enhancement under the United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual (\"U.S.S.G.\") &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1). Second, he challenges his sentence in the wake of <i>Booker,</i> where the Supreme Court held that the guidelines must be treated as advisory rather than mandatory.

Application of the Firearm Sentencing Enhancement</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's interpretation of the guidelines <i>de novo</i> and its factual findings for clear error. <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201981\"><a href=\"/opinion/201981/united-states-v-robinson/\"><span class=\"volume\">433</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 35, 38 (1st Cir.2005). In this case, the district court applied a two-level sentencing enhancement for firearm possession under U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1), noting that the defendant acknowledged that the police had found a loaded handgun in his apartment, and that the defendant stated that he bought the gun for \"personal protection after a series of armed home invasions\" in his area. The court also applied a two-level reduction under the \"safety valve\" provision of U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2. The defendant and the prosecution agreed that the provision was applicable, despite its requirement that the defendant show that he was not in possession of the firearm in connection with the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendant argues that, because the government conceded that the safety valve applies, the district court erred in applying the two-level sentencing enhancement for gun possession. The district court found nothing contradictory about applying both the enhancement and the reduction, concluding that different standards apply for each.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court. The burdens for establishing the applicability of the safety valve reduction and the weapon enhancement are different. Section 5C1.2, the \"safety valve\" provision, permits a two-level reduction in offense level if the defendant and the offense meet certain enumerated criteria. <i>See United States v. McLean,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"790402\"><a href=\"/opinion/790402/united-states-v-dale-mclean-united-states-of-america-v-manolin-feliz/\"><span class=\"volume\">409</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 500 (1st Cir.2005). Pertinent to this case, \"the safety valve is unavailable to a defendant who `possesses a firearm . . . in connection with the offense.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 5C1.2). Thus, the defendant has the burden of establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that he did not possess the firearm in connection with the offense. <i>See United States v. Miranda-Santiago,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196984\"><a href=\"/opinion/196984/united-states-v-miranda-santiago/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">517</span></a></span>, 529 n. 25 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 2D1.1(b)(1) permits a two-level enhancement \"[i]f a dangerous weapon (including a firearm) was possessed.\" To garner this enhancement, the government has the initial burden of establishing \"that a firearm possessed by the defendant was present during the commission of the offense.\" <i>United States v. McDonald,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744603\"><a href=\"/opinion/744603/united-states-v-cecilio-f-mcdonald/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">7</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1997). Once the government has made that showing, \"the burden shifts to the defendant to persuade the factfinder that a connection between the weapon and the crime is clearly improbable.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added); <i>see also</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1), cmt. n. 3 (\"The adjustment should be applied if the weapon was present, unless it is clearly improbable that the weapon was connected with the offense.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the burden on the defendant is different for these two sentencing provisions. The application of the safety valve (which requires the defendant to establish by a <i>preponderance of the evidence</i> that he did not possess the firearm in connection with the offense) does not necessarily mean that the defendant can meet the heavier burden, once the government shows that the firearm was present during the commission of the offense, of establishing that it was <i>clearly improbable</i> that the gun was used in connection with the offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts have addressed similar arguments regarding the interaction of the safety valve adjustment under &#167; 5C1.2 and the firearm enhancement under &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> At least two circuits have concluded that the application of a firearm enhancement under &#167; 2D1.1(b) does not necessarily preclude a safety valve reduction under &#167; 5C1.2.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>See United States v.

In other words, these courts held that the defendant's failure to meet the higher burden of proof set forth in the firearm enhancement provision of the guidelines did not necessarily preclude the defendant from meeting the lower burden of proof set forth in the safety valve reduction provision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of his position that the application of the safety valve reduction precludes the application of the firearm enhancement in his case, Anderson relies primarily on <i>United States v. Vasquez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"759540\"><a href=\"/opinion/759540/united-states-v-daniel-vasquez/\"><span class=\"volume\">161</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">909</span></a></span> (5th Cir.1998). In <i>Vasquez,</i> the Fifth Circuit stated that \"&#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) and &#167; 5C1.2(2) . . . should be analyzed analogously.\" <i>Id.</i> at 912. However, the Fifth Circuit's description of the government's burden under &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) differs from the analysis of that burden in our precedent. The Fifth Circuit states that \"[t]he government has the burden of proof under &#167; 2D1.1 of showing by a preponderance of the evidence that a temporal and spatial relation existed between the weapon, the drug trafficking activity, and the defendant.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). By contrast, as explained above, we have held that the government must show that a firearm was present during the commission of an offense. The burden then shifts to the defendant to show that it is clearly improbable that the gun was used in connection with the offense. Because of these differing approaches, the Fifth Circuit's reasoning is inapplicable in this case. <i>See Nelson,</i> 222 F.3d at 550 n. 3 (distinguishing <i>Vasquez</i> based on its different approach to the burden under &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We thus discern no legal error in the district court's application of the firearm enhancement given its acceptance of the safety valve reduction. Nor were the district court's findings related to the firearm enhancement clearly erroneous. The defendant conceded that there was a loaded gun in the home in which he sold drugs. On that basis alone, the government met its burden of establishing that the gun was present at the commission of the offense. <i>See McDonald,</i> 121 F.3d at 10 (\"[T]he prosecution need only prove that the defendant possessed the weapon during the currency of the offense, not necessarily that he actually used it in perpetrating the crime or that he intended to do so.\"). In his objection to the PSI and during sentencing, defense counsel argued only that Anderson bought the gun after a series of home invasions took place in his area. This fact does not establish that a connection between the weapon and the crime is clearly improbable. <i>See United States v. Corcimiglia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"585785\"><a href=\"/opinion/585785/united-states-v-deborah-d-corcimiglia/\"><span class=\"volume\">967</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">724</span></a></span>, 727 (1st Cir. 1992) (\"[W]hen the weapon's location makes it readily available to protect either the participants themselves during the commission of illegal activity or the drugs and cash involved in the drug business, there will be sufficient evidence to connect the weapons to the offense conduct.\"). Thus, we discern no error in the district court's application of the sentencing enhancement.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Booker</i> error</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that Anderson preserved his <i>Booker</i> claim by raising a <i>Blakely</i> argument in the district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See United States v.

V&#225;zquez-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201585\"><a href=\"/opinion/201585/united-states-v-vazquez-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">476</span></a></span>, 489 (1st Cir.2005). \"The standard of proof, however, depends on whether the error is conceived of as constitutional.\" <i>Id.</i> If the error is constitutional in nature, \"the government has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the error did not affect the defendant's substantial rights.\" <i>Id.</i> If the error is not constitutional in nature, the government has the burden of demonstrating the absence of any \"grave doubt\" regarding the harmlessness of the error. <i>See id.</i> In the <i>Booker</i> context, we have explained that constitutional error exists \"where a mandatory Guidelines sentence was imposed on the basis of judge-found facts,\" in violation of the Sixth Amendment. <i>Id.</i> We have not previously decided \"whether <i>Booker</i> error arising out of the mandatory application of the Guidelines alone ... is constitutional in nature.\" <i>Id.</i> at 490 n. 7.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the government acknowledged that it has the difficult burden of proving harmless error, but it did not specify which specific standard is applicable. Because the government only had the burden at sentencing of establishing the presence of the gun for the firearm enhancement, and Anderson conceded that his gun was present in his home where the drug buys occurred, it is arguable that the <i>Booker</i> error in this case involves only the mandatory application of the guidelines. However, regardless of whether such an error is constitutional, we conclude that the government has not met its burden of proving harmless error. The government argues that \"nothing in the record suggests that, given a chance to reflect again, the lower court would select anything other than the 57-month term it chose initially.\" To support this assertion, the government points to the judge's statements during sentencing that the crime \"deserves the punishment that is being imposed,\" and that the sentence was \"a legitimate and adequate sentence.\" However, the government fails to account for the district court's consideration and discussion of Anderson's \"serious mental health issues,\" presented in support of his request for a downward departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addressing this request, the district court correctly noted that the guidelines discourage departures on the basis of mental health problems unless the facts take the case outside of the \"heartland\" of other cases involving defendants with mental health problems. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Maldonado-Montalvo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200777\"><a href=\"/opinion/200777/united-states-v-maldonado-montalvo/\"><span class=\"volume\">356</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.2003) (explaining that, under the guidelines, \"departures based upon a defendant's mental condition are discouraged, which means that the sentencing court must first make a finding that the mental condition is extraordinary or atypical\" (internal citations omitted)); <i>United States v. Studley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544230\"><a href=\"/opinion/544230/united-states-v-james-studley/\"><span class=\"volume\">907</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span>, 258 (1st Cir.1990) (\"[The guidelines] specifically state[] that defendant's mental or emotional conditions are not ordinarily relevant. If they are to be considered, the district court must expressly find that the defendant's particular mental or emotional condition is `atypical.'\" (emphasis omitted)). Our precedent has been \"stringent in distinguishing between serious mental health problems and a truly `extraordinary' case\" under the guidelines. <i>United States v. Derbes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201042\"><a href=\"/opinion/201042/united-states-v-derbes/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">579</span></a></span>, 583 (1st Cir.2004); <i>see also Maldonado-Montalvo,</i> 356 F.3d at 74 (concluding that defendant's \"severe or major depression\" did not rise to the level of \"extraordinary\" and thus did not warrant downward departure).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After carefully considering the facts presented on Anderson's mental health history, the court found that \"[i]t's unfortunately the case that Mr. Anderson's condition is not outside the heartland\" and that, although his condition was serious and severe, the court \"see[s] a number of severe or serious mental health issues.\" This is a classic mandatory guidelines analysis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking into account the heavy burden of the government to establish harmless error, we must question the government's assertion that the district court would not sentence Anderson more leniently in a post-<i>Booker</i> world. We have explained that, \"under the advisory guidelines scheme set in place by <i>Booker,</i> a sentencing court will ordinarily begin by calculating the applicable guidelines range and then determine whether other factors `warrant an ultimate sentence above or below the guideline range.'\" <i>United States v.

Although rejecting Anderson's request for a downward departure under the mandatory guidelines system, the district court acknowledged that it was \"certainly clear that Mr. Anderson has severe mental health issues.\" Moreover, the district court sentenced him to the lowest end of the guidelines range. Given the burden on the government, we are not persuaded-either as to the absence of a \"grave doubt\" or beyond a reasonable doubt-that the district court would not have imposed a lower sentence in this case if the guidelines had been advisory rather than mandatory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons explained above, we <i>vacate</i> the defendant's sentence and <i>remand</i> to the district court for re-sentencing.

Thus, the question on appeal in those cases was whether the district court erred in automatically precluding the defendants from the safety valve reduction. That question differs from what we are considering here&#8212;whether the application of the safety valve reduction in Anderson's case should have automatically precluded the application of the firearm enhancement. However, the discussion of the differing burdens for the safety valve reduction and firearm enhancement provisions in those cases is helpful for our analysis</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Anderson also appears to challenge the district court's application of the firearm sentencing enhancement under<i>Booker.</i> Specifically, he argues that his concession that he had a loaded gun in his home does not amount to proof beyond a reasonable doubt that the gun was used in connection with the offense. This challenge is a non-starter. <i>Booker</i> does not require the government, in an advisory guidelines system, to assume burdens that are allocated to the defendant under the guidelines, or change the applicable burden from preponderance of the evidence to proof beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See United States v.
