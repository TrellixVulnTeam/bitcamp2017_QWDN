It is widely thought that \"[n]o\n\naspect of the extension of the American legal system beyond the\n\nterritorial frontier of the United States has given rise to so much\n\nfriction   as   the   requests   for    documents    in    investigation   and\n\nlitigation in the United States.\"            Restatement (Third) of Foreign\n\nRelations Law of the United States § 442, reporters' note 1 (1987).\n\nAs the imperatives of transnational business shrink the size of the\n\nglobe, the task of devising an effective yet respectful paradigm\n\nfor easing this friction becomes more and more urgent. The instant\n\nappeal brings the titration into full focus.\n\n           The genesis of the problem in this case lies with an\n\nauditing engagement accepted by Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler\n\nBedrijfsrevisoren (KPMG-B), a Belgian firm that served as the\n\nauditor for a publicly-traded company, Lernout & Hauspie Speech\n\nProducts, N.V. (L&H).       L&H's collapse precipitated a flood of\n\nactions against KPMG-B and others in the courts of this country,\n\nalleging massive securities fraud.              KPMG-B refused to produce\n\nrelevant auditing records and associated work papers, asserting\n\nthat to do so would violate Belgian law.                  A magistrate judge\n\nrejected this assertion and ordered production.             See In re Lernout\n\n& Hauspie Sec. Litig., 218 F.R.D. 348 (D. Mass. 2003) (L&H III).\n\n           In   response,    KPMG-B      repaired    to    a   Belgian   court\n\nrequesting that substantial penalties be imposed on those who might\n\n\"take any step of a procedural or other nature in order to proceed\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fwith the discovery-procedure.\"     The plaintiffs in the pending\n\nAmerican litigation (who had obtained the turnover order in the\n\nfirst instance) implored the district court to enjoin KPMG-B from\n\npursuing the Belgian action.   The district court obliged.    See In\n\nre Lernout & Hauspie Sec. Litig., 2003 WL 22964378, at *2 (D. Mass.\n\nDec. 12, 2003) (L&H IV).1   KPMG-B immediately appealed.   We issued\n\na partial stay of the antisuit injunction and expedited the appeal.\n\nWe now affirm the district court's order.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           As said, this appeal arises out of a welter of cases\n\nhaving a common theme:      the allegation that KPMG-B and others\n\nperpetrated large-scale securities fraud leading to L&H's collapse.\n\nThose cases include several class actions.      Some of them were\n\ncommenced in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMassachusetts and others were transferred to that district.    See,\n\ne.g., Filler v. Lernout, 2002 WL 227079 (D. Del. Feb. 8, 2002).\n\nThe district court has consolidated all the cases.    It would serve\n\nno useful purpose to dissect the plaintiffs' allegations, and we\n\nurge the reader who thirsts for more detailed background knowledge\n\nto consult the district court's published opinions.    See, e.g., In\n\nre Lernout & Hauspie Sec. Litig., 230 F. Supp. 2d 152 (D. Mass.\n\n\n     1\n      The district court accepted, adopted, and elaborated upon the\nreport and recommendation of the magistrate judge.              For\nsimplicity's sake, we do not distinguish between the two judicial\nofficers, but, rather, take an institutional view and refer to the\ndeterminations below as those of the district court.\n\n                                 -3-\n\f2002) (L&H II); In re Lernout & Hauspie Sec. Litig., 214 F. Supp.\n\n2d 100 (D. Mass. 2002) (L&H I).                We rehearse here only those\n\ndevelopments needed to frame the issues on appeal.\n\n              KPMG-B is a target of an ongoing criminal investigation\n\nin Belgium, which arises out of the L&H fiasco.                   It is also a\n\nprincipal      defendant     in    the   aforedescribed     securities     fraud\n\nlitigation.       KPMG-B has not disputed the district court's in\n\npersonam jurisdiction.            It did seek to secure dismissal of the\n\nsecurities fraud litigation on forum non conveniens grounds, but\n\nfailed in that effort.        See L&H II, 230 F. Supp. 2d at 176.         At the\n\nsame time, the district court determined that the consolidated\n\ncomplaint      against      KPMG-B   satisfied    the     stringent     pleading\n\nrequirements of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of\n\n1995 (PSLRA), 15 U.S.C. § 78u-4(b)(2), and Federal Rule of Civil\n\nProcedure 9(b).       L&H II, 230 F. Supp. 2d at 165-66.\n\n              Once past these threshold issues, the securities fraud\n\nplaintiffs embarked on pretrial discovery.              In September of 2002,\n\nthey served document requests for KPMG-B's work papers.                 See Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 34.     The plaintiffs did not get very far; KPMG-B refused\n\nto   comply    with   the    requests,     asseverating    that   Belgian    law\n\nprohibited it from divulging the information sought.                  While this\n\ngame of cat and mouse was taking place, the plaintiffs, acting on\n\nKPMG-B's advice, became civil co-prosecutors in the ongoing Belgian\n\ncriminal investigation. Through this participation, they were able\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fto examine all the documents that were not deemed confidential by\n\nthe Belgian       prosecutor,   but   they   were    not    permitted   to   copy\n\ndocuments for use in the securities fraud litigation.\n\n            Tantalized by their glimpse of the work papers, the\n\nsecurities fraud plaintiffs moved to compel their production.                   A\n\nmagistrate    judge      took   briefing     and    heard    argument   on    the\n\napplicability of and exceptions to the Belgian secrecy law.2                   On\n\nNovember 13, 2003, he rejected KPMG-B's arguments and ordered\n\nproduction of the work papers on or before the close of business on\n\nDecember 1, 2003.\n\n            On November 27, 2003 — Thanksgiving day — KPMG-B filed an\n\nex parte petition with a court in Brussels, seeking to enjoin the\n\nsecurities fraud plaintiffs from \"taking any step\" to proceed with\n\nthe requested discovery.         To ensure compliance, they asked the\n\nBelgian court to impose a fine of one million Euros for each\n\nviolation    of    the   proposed     injunction.3          The   Belgian    court\n\n\n     2\n      The parties agree that, as a general matter, Article 458 of\nthe Belgian Criminal Code prohibits auditors from disclosing\nconfidential client information.    There are, however, numerous\nexceptions to that general proscription.       The parties have\ndiffering views as to whether KPMG-B's disclosure of its work\npapers pursuant to the district court's turnover order would (or\nwould not) fall within any one of these exceptions.\n     3\n      In pertinent part, KPMG-B's petition asked the Belgian court\nfor the following:\n\n            To prohibit defendants, upon forfeitment of a\n            penalty of 1.000.000 EUR per infraction by\n            each defendant, to take any step of a\n            procedural or other nature in order to proceed\n\n                                      -5-\n\frefused to act ex parte; instead, it directed that notice be\n\nprovided to the securities fraud plaintiffs and scheduled a hearing\n\nfor December 16, 2003.         On December 1, KPMG-B gave notice of the\n\ninstitution     of    the    Belgian   action     to   the   securities      fraud\n\nplaintiffs.     It also filed an objection to the magistrate judge's\n\nrecommended decision.          That objection is still pending in the\n\ndistrict court (there is, among other things, a disagreement as to\n\nits timeliness). Finally, KPMG-B moved to stay the turnover order.\n\n          Faced       with    the   threat   of      extravagant    fines,     the\n\nsecurities fraud plaintiffs sought the district court's protection.\n\nOn   December    9,    the    magistrate     judge     issued   a   report     and\n\nrecommendation urging the entry of an order enjoining KPMG-B from\n\nproceeding with its Belgian action.               The district judge held a\n\nhearing two days later and issued an antisuit injunction, the full\n\ntext of which is reproduced below:\n\n\n\n\n          with the discovery-procedure, initiated by\n          them in the framework of the aforementioned\n          American procedures, including but not limited\n          to:\n               1.   taking any step of a procedural or\n          other nature in order to execute or rely on\n          the decision of the District Court of\n          Massachusetts dated 13 November 2003 to\n          produce the audit working papers;\n               2.   taking any step of a procedural or\n          other nature in the framework of the order of\n          the American judge in its decision of 13\n          November 2003 to meet and confer with\n          Petitioner concerning the production of the\n          requested documents . . . .\n\n                                       -6-\n\f            The Court preliminarily enjoins KPMG-Belgium\n            from proceeding with its writ, orders KPMG-\n            Belgium to withdraw forthwith its writ in the\n            Court of First Instance of Brussels and orders\n            it not to proceed with the hearing scheduled\n            on December 16, 2003. KPMG-Belgium shall file\n            proof of compliance with this order.\n\nL&H IV, 2003 WL 22964378, at *2.       Hot on the heels of this order,\n\nthe magistrate judge denied KPMG-B's motion to stay the turnover\n\norder, branding that motion untimely. In re Lernout & Hauspie Sec.\n\nLitig., 219 F.R.D. 28, 30-31 (D. Mass. 2003) (L&H V).              KPMG-B\n\nimmediately appealed the entry of the antisuit injunction.             We\n\ngranted a limited stay of the injunction, permitting KPMG-B to\n\nappear at the December 16 hearing in Brussels for the sole purpose\n\nof requesting a continuance.      The Belgian court has been fully\n\ncooperative, and the foreign action has been continued periodically\n\nduring the pendency of this expedited appeal.         There has been no\n\nfurther action with regard to the turnover order itself.\n\nII.   STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n             A grant of a preliminary injunction typically receives\n\ndeferential review.     McGuire v. Reilly, 260 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).     The trial court's order will stand unless it \"mistook the\n\nlaw, clearly erred in its factual assessments, or otherwise abused\n\nits discretion in granting the interim relief.\"       Id.   In our view,\n\nhowever,    international   antisuit    injunctions   —   which   involve\n\nimportant considerations of comity — warrant a heightened level of\n\nappellate review.    Cf. United States v. O'Brien, 895 F.2d 810, 814\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f(1st Cir. 1990) (considering the importance of the interest at\n\nstake    when   ascertaining      the   appropriate   standard     of   review).\n\nConsequently, we deem it appropriate to conduct an independent\n\nreview of the justification for the issuance of an international\n\nantisuit injunction.       This is an \"intermediate level of scrutiny,\n\nmore     rigorous   than    the     abuse-of-discretion      or     clear-error\n\nstandards, but stopping short of plenary or de novo review.\"\n\nUnited States v. Tortora, 922 F.2d 880, 883 (1st Cir. 1990).               Given\n\nour chosen standard of review, we cede a modest degree of deference\n\nto the trier's exercise of discretion, but \"we will not hesitate to\n\nact upon our independent judgment if it appears that a mistake has\n\nbeen made.\"      El Dia, Inc. v. Hernandez Colon, 963 F.2d 488, 492\n\n(1st Cir. 1992).\n\nIII.     ANALYSIS\n\n             Determining    the    appropriateness     of   an    international\n\nantisuit injunction is a highly nuanced exercise.                 An inquiring\n\ncourt    must   find   a   way    to    accommodate   conflicting,      mutually\n\ninconsistent national policies without unduly interfering with the\n\njudicial processes of a foreign sovereign.            See Laker Airways Ltd.\n\nv. Sabena, Belgian World Airlines, 731 F.2d 909, 916 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1984).    This task is particularly formidable given the absence of\n\nguidance from the Supreme Court and the paucity of precedent in\n\nthis circuit; the Justices have not spoken to the criteria for\n\ngranting an international antisuit injunction and this court has\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fpassed on that question only once (and then, glancingly).                         See\n\nCanadian Filters (Harwich) Ltd. v. Lear-Siegler, Inc., 412 F.2d 577\n\n(1st Cir. 1969).          We begin our analysis by articulating the\n\nstandards that ought to govern the question.                 We then apply those\n\nstandards to the case at hand.\n\n                     A.   Articulating the Standards.\n\n           It is common ground that federal courts have the power to\n\nenjoin those subject to their personal jurisdiction from pursuing\n\nlitigation before foreign tribunals.             See, e.g., Kaepa, Inc. v.\n\nAchilles Corp., 76 F.3d 624, 626 (5th Cir. 1996); China Trade &\n\nDev. Corp. v. M.V. Choong Yong, 837 F.2d 33, 35 (2d Cir. 1987).\n\nThe exercise of that power must be tempered, however, by the\n\naccepted proposition that parallel proceedings on the same in\n\npersonam     claim    generally     should       be     allowed      to    proceed\n\nsimultaneously.      Laker Airways, 731 F.2d at 926.              The decisional\n\ncalculus   must   take    account   of   this    presumption         in   favor    of\n\nconcurrent    jurisdiction.         It    also        must    take    account      of\n\nconsiderations of international comity.           After all, even though an\n\ninternational     antisuit    injunction     operates         only   against      the\n\nparties, it effectively restricts the jurisdiction of a foreign\n\nsovereign's courts.       See, e.g., China Trade, 837 F.2d at 35-36.\n\n           Federal courts have been consentient in endorsing these\n\nprinciples.     Beyond that point, however, the waters grow murky.\n\nThe courts of appeals have differed as to the legal standards to be\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\femployed     in    determining     whether    the     power   to   enjoin   an\n\ninternational proceeding should be exercised. Two basic views have\n\nemerged.    For ease in reference, we shall call the more permissive\n\nof these views the liberal approach and the more restrictive of\n\nthem the conservative approach. See Note, Antisuit Injunctions and\n\nInternational Comity, 71 Va. L. Rev. 1039, 1049-51 (1985) (using\n\nthis nomenclature).\n\n            The liberal approach has been championed by two courts of\n\nappeals:    the Fifth Circuit, Kaepa, 76 F.3d at 627, and the Ninth\n\nCircuit, Seattle Totems Hockey Club, Inc. v. Nat'l Hockey League,\n\n652 F.2d 852, 855-56 (9th Cir. 1981).               In addition, the Seventh\n\nCircuit has pronounced itself \"incline[d] toward\" the liberal view.\n\nPhilips Med. Sys. Int'l v. Bruetman, 8 F.3d 600, 605 (7th Cir.\n\n1993).   Under this approach, an international antisuit injunction\n\nis appropriate whenever there is a duplication of parties and\n\nissues     and    the   court    determines   that     the    prosecution   of\n\nsimultaneous proceedings would frustrate the speedy and efficient\n\ndetermination of the case.         Kaepa, 76 F.3d at 627; Seattle Totems,\n\n652 F.2d at 856.        We do not mean to suggest that courts employing\n\nthe liberal approach do not give weight to considerations of\n\ninternational comity.       For the most part, they do — but they tend\n\nto define that interest in a relatively narrow manner and to assign\n\nit only modest weight.          See, e.g., Kaepa, 76 F.3d at 627 (noting\n\n\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\fthat   an     international    antisuit   injunction    does   not   \"actually\n\nthreaten relations\" between the two involved nations).\n\n              Four courts of appeals have espoused the conservative\n\napproach      for   gauging   the   propriety   of   international   antisuit\n\ninjunctions.        See Stonington Partners, Inc. v. Lernout & Hauspie\n\nSpeech Prods., 310 F.3d 118, 126 (3d Cir. 2002); Gau Shan Co. v.\n\nBankers Trust Co., 956 F.2d 1349, 1355 (6th Cir. 1992); China\n\nTrade, 837 F.2d at 36 (2d Cir.); Laker Airways, 731 F.2d at 927\n\n(D.C. Cir.). Under this approach, the critical questions anent the\n\nissuance of an international antisuit injunction are whether the\n\nforeign action either imperils the jurisdiction of the forum court\n\nor threatens some strong national policy.             See, e.g., Stonington\n\nPartners, 310 F.3d at 127; China Trade, 837 F.2d at 36.                   This\n\napproach accords appreciably greater weight to considerations of\n\ninternational comity.\n\n              We reject the liberal approach.         We deem international\n\ncomity an important integer in the decisional calculus — and the\n\nliberal approach assigns too low a priority to that interest.               In\n\nthe bargain, it undermines the age-old presumption in favor of\n\nconcurrent parallel proceedings — a value judgment that leaves us\n\nuneasy — and presumes that public policy always favors allowing a\n\nsuit pending in an American court to go forward without any\n\nsubstantial impediment.        To cinch matters, this approach gives far\n\ntoo    easy    passage   to   international     antisuit   injunctions.     We\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\funderstand that the judicial process is a cornerstone of the\n\nAmerican way of life — but in an area that raises significant\n\nseparation       of   powers     concerns        and    implicates     international\n\nrelations, we believe that the law calls for a more cautious and\n\nmeasured approach.\n\n            The conservative approach has more to commend it. First,\n\nit     recognizes      the     rebuttable        presumption     against       issuing\n\ninternational         antisuit       injunctions       (and,   thus,    honors     the\n\npresumption favoring the maintenance of parallel proceedings).\n\nSecond, it is more respectful of principles of international\n\ncomity.    Third, it compels an inquiring court to balance competing\n\npolicy considerations.           Last — but far from least — it fits snugly\n\nwith the logic of Canadian Filters, in which we said that issuing\n\nan international antisuit injunction is a step that should \"be\n\ntaken only with care and great restraint\" and with the recognition\n\nthat international comity is a fundamental principle deserving of\n\nsubstantial deference.           412 F.2d at 578.\n\n            We stop short, however, of an uncritical acceptance of\n\nthe conservative approach. The recent expositions of that approach\n\nhave     come    to    regard     the     two    main    rationales     upon     which\n\ninternational antisuit injunctions may be grounded — preservation\n\nof jurisdiction and protection of important national policies — as\n\nexclusive.       See, e.g., Gen. Elec. Co. v. Deutz AG, 270 F.3d 144,\n\n160-61     (3d    Cir.       2001)      (describing      these   as     the    \"only\"\n\n\n                                          -12-\n\fjustifications       that   can    support    the    issuance    of    such   an\n\ninjunction);    Gau    Shan,   956   F.2d    at   1355    (similar).    We    are\n\nuncomfortable with this gloss, for it evinces a certain woodenness.\n\nIn our view, the sensitive and fact-specific nature of the inquiry\n\ncounsels against the use of inflexible rules.\n\n             We therefore reject this reworking of the conservative\n\napproach and instead endorse its traditional version. That version\n\nis not only more flexible but also more consistent with Laker\n\nAirways — which we regard as the seminal opinion in this field of\n\nlaw.   The Laker Airways court did not suggest that its two stated\n\nrationales    were    the   only   ones   that    could   justify   issuing   an\n\ninternational antisuit injunction.           731 F.2d at 927 (noting that\n\n\"[i]njunctions are most often necessary\" to protect the court's\n\njurisdiction or to prevent evasion of the nation's important\n\npolicies).    Rather, the court indicated that it was prudent to use\n\na wider-angled lens, making clear that the equitable considerations\n\nsurrounding each request for an injunction should be examined\n\ncarefully.     Id.\n\n           In order to provide guidance for the district courts, we\n\nspell out the manner in which our preferred approach operates. The\n\ngatekeeping inquiry is, of course, whether parallel suits involve\n\nthe same parties and issues.         Unless that condition is met, a court\n\nordinarily should go no further and refuse the issuance of an\n\ninternational antisuit injunction.            See, e.g., China Trade, 837\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\fF.2d at 36; Laker Airways, 731 F.2d at 928; see also George A.\n\nBermann,     The    Use    of    Anti-Suit        Injunctions      in     International\n\nLitigation, 28 Colum. J. Transnat'l L. 589, 626 (1990) (stating\n\nthat     courts    generally      \"will     not    consider       issuing     anti-suit\n\ninjunctions\" unless there are \"parallel local and foreign actions\n\nbetween the same parties over the same claim\").                     If — and only if\n\n— this threshold condition is satisfied should the court proceed to\n\nconsider all the facts and circumstances in order to decide whether\n\nan injunction is proper.                In this analysis, considerations of\n\ninternational comity must be given substantial weight — and those\n\nconsiderations       ordinarily         establish       a    rebuttable     presumption\n\nagainst the issuance of an order that has the effect of halting\n\nforeign judicial proceedings.\n\n            We acknowledge that the task of determining when a\n\nlitigant has overcome this presumption is a difficult one. That is\n\npartly because comity is an elusive concept. The Supreme Court has\n\ndefined it as \"the recognition which one nation allows within its\n\nterritory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another\n\nnation,     having       due    regard    both     to       international    duty   and\n\nconvenience, and to the rights of its own citizens or of other\n\npersons who are under the protection of its laws.\"                           Hilton v.\n\nGuyot,    159     U.S.   113,    164    (1895).         Judge   Aldrich     trenchantly\n\ndescribed it as \"a blend of courtesy and expedience.\"                          Canadian\n\nFilters, 412 F.2d at 578.              Whatever definition is employed, it is\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\fpellucid that comity is not a matter of rigid obligation, but,\n\nrather, a protean concept of jurisdictional respect.                 And to\n\ncomplicate matters, comity, like beauty, sometimes is in the eye of\n\nthe beholder.\n\n           We hasten to add that although the definition of comity\n\nmay be tenebrous, its importance could not be more clear.             In an\n\nincreasingly global economy, commercial transactions involving\n\nparticipants from many lands have become common fare.           This world\n\neconomic interdependence has highlighted the importance of comity,\n\nas international commerce depends to a large extent on \"the ability\n\nof merchants to predict the likely consequences of their conduct in\n\noverseas   markets.\"      Gau   Shan,     956    F.2d   at   1355.     This\n\npredictability, in turn, depends on cooperation, reciprocity, and\n\nrespect among nations. That helps to explain the enduring need for\n\na presumption — albeit a rebuttable one — against the issuance of\n\ninternational antisuit injunctions.\n\n           In   the   final   analysis,    rebutting    this   presumption\n\ninvolves a continual give and take.       In the course of that give and\n\ntake, the presumption may be counterbalanced by other facts and\n\nfactors particular to a specific case.          These include (but are by\n\nno means limited to) such things as:      the nature of the two actions\n\n(i.e., whether they are merely parallel or whether the foreign\n\naction is more properly classified as interdictory); the posture of\n\nthe proceedings in the two countries; the conduct of the parties\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f(including their good faith or lack thereof); the importance of the\n\npolicies at stake in the litigation; and, finally, the extent to\n\nwhich the foreign action has the potential to undermine the forum\n\ncourt's ability to reach a just and speedy result.\n\n           Seen in this light, we agree that either the preservation\n\nof jurisdiction or the safeguarding of important national policies\n\nmay afford a sufficient basis for the issuance of an international\n\nantisuit   injunction.    We   do    not,   however,    attach   talismanic\n\nsignificance to concepts such as jurisdiction-stripping and insults\n\nto public policy.   Instead, we hold that in every case a district\n\ncourt should examine the totality of the circumstances in deciding\n\nwhether a particular case warrants the issuance of an international\n\nantisuit injunction.     See Laker Airways, 731 F.2d at 927 (\"There\n\nare no precise rules governing the appropriateness of antisuit\n\ninjunctions.\").   If, after giving due regard to the circumstances\n\n(including the salient interest in international comity), a court\n\nsupportably finds that equitable considerations preponderate in\n\nfavor of relief, it may issue an international antisuit injunction.\n\n                    B.   Applying the Standards.\n\n           Against this backdrop, we ponder whether the district\n\ncourt acted within the realm of its discretion when it enjoined\n\nKPMG-B from pursuing the Belgian litigation.           We conclude that it\n\ndid.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\f             The lower court applied the traditional four-part test\n\nfor preliminary injunctions.       See, e.g., Ross-Simons of Warwick,\n\nInc. v. Baccarat, Inc., 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1996) (describing\n\nthe four-part test).       Because this generic algorithm provides an\n\nawkward fit in cases involving international antisuit injunctions,\n\ndistrict courts have no obligation to employ it in that context.\n\nSee Stonington Partners, 310 F.3d at 129.           Here, however, any\n\nmethodological error was harmless:        the district court, as part of\n\nits inquiry, carefully considered all of the critical factors.\n\n             We need not belabor the obvious.    The parties and issues\n\nare substantially similar, thus satisfying the gatekeeping inquiry.\n\nThe district judge acknowledged the importance of comity concerns\n\nin her published opinion.      See L&H IV, 2003 WL 22964378, at *2.      A\n\nreading of the hearing transcript leaves no doubt that she was\n\nfully   aware   of   the   potential   ramifications   with   respect   to\n\ninternational comity and that she gave heavy weight to those\n\nconcerns.    However, she placed on the opposite pan of the scale the\n\ncharacter of the foreign action, the public policy favoring the\n\nsafeguarding of investors from securities fraud, the need to\n\nprotect the court's own processes, and the balance of the equities.\n\nId. at *1-*2.    In the end, the court determined that those factors\n\ncounterbalanced comity concerns in the peculiar circumstances of\n\nthis case.    Id. at *2.   Having conducted an independent review, we\n\nfind that determination fully supportable.\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f          The essential character of the Belgian action is easily\n\ndiscerned.    In it, KPMG-B seeks to impose huge financial penalties\n\non the securities fraud plaintiffs should they take any steps to\n\nenforce the district court's turnover order. This attempt to chill\n\nlegitimate discovery by in terrorem tactics can scarcely be viewed\n\nas anything but an effort to \"quash the practical power of the\n\nUnited States courts.\"         Laker Airways, 731 F.2d at 938; see United\n\nStates v. Davis, 767 F.2d 1025, 1029 (2d Cir. 1985) (upholding\n\ninjunction of foreign proceeding where the \"sole purpose\" of\n\ninstituting    that       proceeding   \"was   to    block     compliance   with   a\n\nlegitimate trial subpoena\").           Thus, the foreign action is plainly\n\ninterdictory in nature.\n\n             Where, as here, a party institutes a foreign action in a\n\nblatant attempt to evade the rightful authority of the forum court,\n\nthe need for an antisuit injunction crests. See Laker Airways, 731\n\nF.2d at 929-30.       Fairly read, KPMG-B's petition to the Belgian\n\ntribunal seeks to arrest the progress of the securities fraud\n\naction by thwarting the very discovery that the district court,\n\nwhich is intimately familiar with the exigencies of the underlying\n\ncase, has deemed essential to the continued prosecution of the\n\naction against any of the defendants. In technical terms, this may\n\nnot   constitute      a    frontal     assault     on   the    district    court's\n\njurisdiction, but the practical effect is the same.                   That is a\n\nmatter of considerable import:            a court has a right — indeed, a\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fduty — to preserve its ability to do justice between the parties in\n\ncases that are legitimately before it.    See id. at 930; see also\n\nDavis, 767 F.2d at 1039 (upholding an antisuit injunction as\n\n\"necessary to ensure a complete adjudication of the matter before\n\nit\").\n\n          The equities also counsel in favor of affirming the\n\ndistrict court's order.   This is not a case in which a trial court\n\nis enabling a fishing expedition.   The securities fraud plaintiffs\n\nhave survived the PSLRA's heightened pleading requirements and,\n\nmoreover, they have actually seen the documents that they seek.\n\nConsequently, they know that they are not fishing in an empty\n\nstream.\n\n          In weighing the equities, we also think it noteworthy\n\nthat KPMG-B, not the securities fraud plaintiffs or the district\n\ncourt, set the stage for a crisis of comity.     If KPMG-B had not\n\nfiled a foreign petition calculated to generate interference with\n\nan ongoing American case, the district court would have had no need\n\nto issue a defensive injunction that sought only to preserve the\n\ncourt's ability to adjudicate the claims before it according to the\n\nlaw of the United States.     And, finally, KPMG-B's actions are\n\nharder to accept because it had available to it other options for\n\nseeking resolution of its client confidentiality concerns.     The\n\nmost obvious choice was to pursue and exhaust its position in the\n\nfederal judicial system before attempting to sidetrack that system.\n\n\n                               -19-\n\fAlternatively, it could have sought clarification from the Belgian\n\ncourts without raising the stakes to a level that necessarily\n\nprecipitated a direct conflict with the pending securities fraud\n\naction.   It eschewed these options.   Having called the tune, it\n\nhardly seems inequitable that KPMG-B must now pay the piper.\n\n          KPMG-B's remaining arguments need not occupy us for long.\n\nFirst, it posits that the district court erred when it entered the\n\nantisuit injunction prior to reviewing the magistrate judge's\n\nturnover order (including his assessment of the Belgian law issue).\n\nThis argument is hopeless.\n\n          District courts have broad discretion in determining the\n\nsequence of their rulings.     Cf. Dynamic Image Techs., Inc. v.\n\nUnited States, 221 F.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir. 2000) (noting trial\n\ncourt's substantial discretion in deciding when to rule upon\n\nparticular motions).   Here, moreover, KPMG-B left the district\n\ncourt no practical alternative.   By electing to file its petition\n\nin Belgium before it lodged an objection to the magistrate judge's\n\nrecommended decision, KPMG-B effectively dictated the sequence of\n\nsubsequent events.\n\n          KPMG-B next contends that the lower court erred as a\n\nmatter of law by failing to give due regard to the possible use of\n\nletters rogatory as a means of securing the requested documents.\n\nThis contention lacks force.\n\n\n\n\n                               -20-\n\f              While letters rogatory are among the discovery devices\n\navailable in a federal court, parties are not required to resort to\n\nthem       come   what    may.     See    Société    Nationale    Industrielle\n\nAérospatiale v. United States Dist. Court, 482 U.S. 522, 543-44\n\n(1987).      The transcripts of the relevant hearings make it crystal\n\nclear that, in this instance, the district court fully considered,\n\nand flatly rejected, the argument that letters rogatory would serve\n\nas a satisfactory substitute for a turnover order. Bearing in mind\n\nthe district court's superior coign of vantage, we are loath to\n\nsecond-guess        its   pragmatic      judgment.     Under     the   best   of\n\ncircumstances, letters rogatory are burdensome, costly, and time-\n\nconsuming.        Id. at 542.    For various reasons — including the fact\n\nthat Belgium is not a signatory to the Hague Convention4 — the\n\ncircumstances here are far from ideal.\n\n              Nor can we accept KPMG-B's related contention that, as a\n\nmatter of law, no international antisuit injunction can issue if\n\nthe forum court's goal can be achieved in some other way.              While we\n\nencourage trial courts to search out alternatives that might avoid\n\nthe need to issue antisuit injunctions, we will not force them to\n\n\n\n       4\n      The Hague Convention provides a set of minimum standards for\nsecuring evidence across national borders. See Société Nationale,\n482 U.S. at 532. American courts know that signatory nations are\ncommitted to comply with those standards (and, thus, with requests\nmade in conformity therewith). Because Belgium is not a signatory\nto the Hague Convention, there is an added element of uncertainty\nas to whether (and if so, to what extent) the Belgian courts will\nhonor requests via letters rogatory.\n\n                                         -21-\n\fexhaust   remote    possibilities.       Here,    there     is   no   compelling\n\njustification      for   overriding    the    district    court's     considered\n\njudgment that letters rogatory are not a reasonably equivalent\n\nalternative to the turnover order.\n\n           Finally, KPMG-B asserts that because the securities fraud\n\nplaintiffs will eventually gain access to the requested documents\n\neven in the absence of a turnover order, the injunction was\n\nimprovidently      issued.      This    assertion        elevates     hope   over\n\nlikelihood.\n\n           KPMG-B's thesis is, in substance, that the work papers\n\nwill be made available by the Belgian prosecutor at the conclusion\n\nof the criminal investigation.          But there is a rub:           we have no\n\nreliable way of knowing when that investigation will end and, in\n\nall events, the record is unclear as to whether the outcome of the\n\ninvestigation will (or will not) affect the availability of the\n\nwork papers.    We do not think that a district court must bring the\n\nresolution of a case within its jurisdiction to a dead halt in the\n\nhope that the resolution of a foreign criminal proceeding at an\n\nuncertain future date may alleviate the need for a discovery order.\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We do not mean to minimize the potential difficulty of\n\nthe situation that KPMG-B faces.             To some extent, however, that\n\nsituation is the natural consequence of its decision to ply its\n\nwares in the lucrative American marketplace.                Having elected to\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\festablish a major presence in the United States, KPMG-B must have\n\nanticipated that it would be subject to suit in this country (and,\n\nthus, subject to pretrial discovery rules that are pandemic to the\n\nAmerican justice system).       See Restatement (Third) of Foreign\n\nRelations Law § 442, reporters' note 1 (1987) (noting \"that persons\n\nwho do business in the United States . . . are subject to the\n\nburdens as well as the benefits of United States law, including the\n\nlaws on discovery\"). While courts should \"take care to demonstrate\n\ndue respect for any special problem confronted by [a] foreign\n\nlitigant on account of its nationality,\" Société Nationale, 482\n\nU.S. at 546, a foreign national that chooses to engage in business\n\nin the United States likewise must demonstrate due respect for the\n\noperation of the American judicial system.\n\n          We need go no further.        For the foregoing reasons, we\n\nhold that the district court acted within the encincture of its\n\ndiscretion    in   enjoining   KPMG-B   from   pursuing   its   Belgian\n\nlitigation.    In the last analysis, an international antisuit\n\ninjunction, like any other injunction, is an equitable remedy\n\ndesigned \"to bring the scales into balance.\"        Rosario-Torres v.\n\nHernandez-Colon, 889 F.2d 314, 323 (1st Cir. 1989) (en banc).       In\n\nthis case, the district court acted defensively to protect its own\n\nauthority from an interdictory strike and we are confident that, in\n\ndoing so, the court kept the balance steady and true.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\f           We affirm the district court's injunction order and\n\nvacate the partial stay of that order previously issued by this\n\ncourt.   Costs shall be taxed against the appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                               -24-\n\f",

The district court obliged. <i>See In re Lernout &amp; Hauspie Sec. Litig.,</i> 2003 WL 22964378, at *2 (D.Mass. Dec.12, 2003) (<i>L &amp; H IV</i>).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1-1\" id=\"fn1-1_ref\">1</a> KPMG-B immediately appealed. We issued a partial stay of the antisuit injunction and expedited the appeal. We now affirm the district court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, this appeal arises out of a welter of cases having a common theme: the allegation that KPMG-B and others perpetrated large-scale securities fraud leading to L &amp; H's collapse. Those cases include several class actions. Some of them were commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and others were transferred to that district. <i>See, e.g., Filler v. Lernout,</i> 2002 WL 227079 (D.Del. Feb.8, 2002). The district court has consolidated all the cases. It would serve no useful purpose to dissect the plaintiffs' allegations, and we urge the reader who thirsts for more detailed background knowledge to consult the district court's published opinions. <i>See, e.g., In re Lernout &amp; Hauspie Sec. Litig.,</i> 230 F.Supp.2d 152 (D.Mass.2002) (<i>L &amp; H II</i>); <i>In re Lernout &amp; Hauspie Sec. Litig.,</i> 214 F.Supp.2d 100 (D.Mass.2002) (<i>L &amp; H I</i>). We rehearse here only those developments needed to frame the issues on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">KPMG-B is a target of an ongoing criminal investigation in Belgium, which arises out of the L &amp; H fiasco. It is also a principal defendant in the aforedescribed securities fraud litigation. KPMG-B has not disputed the district court's in personam jurisdiction. It did seek to secure dismissal of the securities fraud litigation on forum non conveniens grounds, but failed in that effort. <i>See L &amp; H II,</i> 230 F.Supp.2d at 176. At the same time, the district court determined that the consolidated complaint against KPMG-B satisfied the stringent pleading requirements of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2), and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). <i>L &amp; H II,</i> 230 F.Supp.2d at 165-66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once past these threshold issues, the securities fraud plaintiffs embarked on pretrial discovery. In September of 2002, they served document requests for KPMG-B's work papers. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 34. The plaintiffs did not get very far; KPMG-B refused to comply with the requests, asseverating that Belgian law prohibited it from divulging the information sought. While this game of cat and mouse was taking place, the plaintiffs, acting on KPMG-B's advice, became civil coprosecutors in the ongoing Belgian criminal investigation. Through this participation, they were able to examine all the documents that were not deemed confidential by the Belgian prosecutor, but they were not permitted to copy documents for use in the securities fraud litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tantalized by their glimpse of the work papers, the securities fraud plaintiffs moved to compel their production. A magistrate judge took briefing and heard argument on the applicability of and exceptions to the Belgian secrecy law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> On November 13, 2003, he rejected KPMG-B's arguments and ordered production of the work papers on or before the close of business on December 1, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 27, 2003 &#8212; Thanksgiving day &#8212; KPMG-B filed an ex parte petition with a court in Brussels, seeking to enjoin the securities fraud plaintiffs from \"taking any step\" to proceed with the requested discovery. To ensure compliance, they asked the Belgian court to impose a fine of one million Euros for each violation of the proposed injunction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Belgian court refused to act ex parte; instead, it directed that notice be provided to the securities fraud plaintiffs and scheduled a hearing for December 16, 2003. On December 1, KPMG-B gave notice of the institution of the Belgian action to the securities fraud plaintiffs. It also filed an objection to the magistrate judge's decision. That objection is still pending in the district court (there is, among other things, a disagreement as to its timeliness). Finally, KPMG-B moved to stay the turnover order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with the threat of extravagant fines, the securities fraud plaintiffs sought the district court's protection. On December 9, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation urging the entry of an order enjoining KPMG-B from proceeding with its Belgian action. The district judge held a hearing two days later and issued an antisuit injunction, the full text of which is reproduced below:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court preliminarily enjoins KPMG-Belgium from proceeding with its writ, orders KPMG-Belgium to withdraw forthwith its writ in the Court of First Instance of Brussels and orders it not to proceed with the hearing scheduled on December 16, 2003. KPMG-Belgium shall file proof of compliance with this order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>L &amp; H IV,</i> 2003 WL 22964378, at *2. Hot on the heels of this order, the magistrate judge denied KPMG-B's motion to stay the turnover order, branding that motion untimely. <i>In re Lernout &amp; Hauspie Sec. Litig.,</i> 219 F.R.D. 28, 30-31 (D.Mass.2003) (<i>L &amp; H V</i>). KPMG-B immediately appealed the entry of the antisuit injunction. We granted a limited stay of the injunction, permitting KPMG-B to appear at the December 16 hearing in Brussels for the sole purpose of requesting a continuance. The Belgian court has been fully cooperative, and the foreign action has been continued periodically during the pendency of this expedited appeal. There has been no further action with regard to the turnover order itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A grant of a preliminary injunction typically receives deferential review. <i>McGuire v. Reilly,</i> 260 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir.2001). The trial court's order will stand unless it \"mistook the law, clearly erred in its factual assessments, or otherwise abused its discretion in granting the interim relief.\" <i>Id.</i> In our view, however, international antisuit injunctions &#8212; which involve important considerations of comity &#8212; warrant a heightened level of appellate review. <i>Cf. United States v. O'Brien,</i> 895 F.2d 810, 814 (1st Cir.1990) (considering the importance of the interest at stake when ascertaining the appropriate standard of review). Consequently, we deem it appropriate to conduct an independent review of the justification for the issuance of an international antisuit injunction. This is an \"intermediate level of scrutiny, more rigorous than the abuse-of-discretion or clear-error standards, but stopping short of plenary or <i>de novo</i> review.\" <i>United States v. Tortora,</i> 922 F.2d 880, 883 (1st Cir.1990). Given our chosen standard of review, we cede a modest degree of deference to the trier's exercise of discretion, but \"we will not hesitate to act upon our independent judgment if it appears that a mistake has been made.\" <i>El Dia, Inc. v. Hernandez Colon,</i> 963 F.2d 488, 492 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determining the appropriateness of an international antisuit injunction is a highly nuanced exercise. An inquiring court must find a way to accommodate conflicting, mutually inconsistent national policies without unduly interfering with the judicial processes of a foreign sovereign. <i>See Laker Airways Ltd. v. Sabena, Belgian World Airlines,</i> 731 F.2d 909, 916 (D.C.Cir.1984). This task is particularly formidable given the absence of guidance from the Supreme Court and the paucity of precedent in this circuit; the Justices have not spoken to the criteria for granting an international antisuit injunction and this court has passed on that question only once (and then, glancingly). <i>See Canadian Filters (Harwich) Ltd. v. Lear-Siegler, Inc.,</i> 412 F.2d 577 (1st Cir.1969). We begin our analysis by articulating the standards that ought to govern the question. We then apply those standards to the case at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Articulating the Standards.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is common ground that federal courts have the power to enjoin those subject to their personal jurisdiction from pursuing litigation before foreign tribunals. <i>See, e.g., Kaepa, Inc. v. Achilles Corp.,</i> 76 F.3d 624, 626 (5th Cir.1996); <i>China Trade &amp; Dev. Corp. v. M.V. Choong Yong,</i> 837 F.2d 33, 35 (2d Cir.1987). The exercise of that power must be tempered, however, by the accepted proposition that parallel proceedings on the same in personam claim generally should be allowed to proceed simultaneously. <i>Laker Airways,</i> 731 F.2d at 926. The decisional calculus must take account of this presumption in favor of concurrent jurisdiction. It also must take account of considerations of international comity. After all, even though an international antisuit injunction operates only against the parties, it effectively restricts the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign's courts. <i>See, e.g., China Trade,</i> 837 F.2d at 35-36.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts have been consentient in endorsing these principles. Beyond that point, however, the waters grow murky. The courts of appeals have differed as to the legal standards to be employed in determining whether the power to enjoin an international proceeding should be exercised. Two basic views have emerged. For ease in reference, we shall call the more permissive of these views the liberal approach and the more restrictive of them the conservative approach. <i>See</i> Note, Antisuit Injunctions and International Comity, 71 Va. L.Rev. 1039, 1049-51 (1985) (using this nomenclature).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The liberal approach has been championed by two courts of appeals: the Fifth Circuit, <i>Kaepa,</i> 76 F.3d at 627, and the Ninth Circuit, <i>Seattle Totems Hockey Club, Inc. v. Nat'l Hockey League,</i> 652 F.2d 852, 855-56 (9th Cir.1981). In addition, the Seventh Circuit has pronounced itself \"incline[d] toward\" the liberal view. <i>Philips Med. Sys. Int'l v. Bruetman,</i> 8 F.3d 600, 605 (7th Cir.1993). Under this approach, an international antisuit injunction is appropriate whenever there is a duplication of parties and issues and the court determines that the prosecution of simultaneous proceedings would frustrate the speedy and efficient determination of the case. <i>Kaepa,</i> 76 F.3d at 627; <i>Seattle Totems,</i> 652 F.2d at 856. We do not mean to suggest that courts employing the liberal approach do not give weight to considerations of international comity. For the most part, they do &#8212; but they tend to define that interest in a relatively narrow manner and to assign it only modest weight. <i>See, e.g., Kaepa,</i> 76 F.3d at 627 (noting that an international antisuit injunction does not \"actually threaten relations\" between the two involved nations).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four courts of appeals have espoused the conservative approach for gauging the propriety of international antisuit injunctions. <i>See Stonington Partners, Inc. v. Lernout &amp; Hauspie Speech Prods.,</i> 310 F.3d 118, 126 (3d Cir.2002); <i>Gau Shan Co. v. Bankers Trust Co.,</i> 956 F.2d 1349, 1355 (6th Cir.1992); <i>China Trade,</i> 837 F.2d at 36 (2d Cir.); <i>Laker Airways,</i> 731 F.2d at 927 (D.C.Cir.). Under this approach, the critical questions anent the issuance of an international antisuit injunction are whether the foreign action either imperils the jurisdiction of the forum court or threatens some strong national policy. <i>See, e.g., Stonington Partners,</i> 310 F.3d at 127; <i>China Trade,</i> 837 F.2d at 36. This approach accords appreciably greater weight to considerations of international comity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the liberal approach. We deem international comity an important integer in the decisional calculus &#8212; and the liberal approach assigns too low a priority to that interest. In the bargain, it undermines the age-old presumption in favor of concurrent parallel proceedings &#8212; a value judgment that leaves us uneasy &#8212; and presumes that public policy always favors allowing a suit pending in an American court to go forward without any substantial impediment. To cinch matters, this approach gives far too easy passage to international antisuit injunctions. We understand that the judicial process is a cornerstone of the American way of life &#8212; but in an area that raises significant separation of powers concerns and implicates international relations, we believe that the law calls for a more cautious and measured approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conservative approach has more to commend it. First, it recognizes the rebuttable presumption against issuing international antisuit injunctions (and, thus, honors the presumption favoring the maintenance of parallel proceedings). Second, it is more respectful of principles of international comity. Third, it compels an inquiring court to balance competing policy considerations. Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; it fits snugly with the logic of <i>Canadian Filters,</i> in which we said that issuing an international antisuit injunction is a step that should \"be taken only with care and great restraint\" and with the recognition that international comity is a fundamental principle deserving of substantial deference. 412 F.2d at 578.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We stop short, however, of an uncritical acceptance of the conservative approach. The recent expositions of that approach have come to regard the two main rationales upon which international antisuit injunctions may be grounded &#8212; preservation of jurisdiction and protection of important national policies &#8212; as exclusive. <i>See, e.g., Gen. Elec. Co. v. Deutz Ag,</i> 270 F.3d 144, 160-61 (3d Cir.2001) (describing these as the \"only\" justifications that can support the issuance of such an injunction); <i>Gau Shan,</i> 956 F.2d at 1355 (similar). We are uncomfortable with this gloss, for it evinces a certain woodenness. In our view, the sensitive and fact-specific nature of the inquiry counsels against the use of inflexible rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject this reworking of the conservative approach and instead endorse its traditional version. That version is not only more flexible but also more consistent with <i>Laker Airways</i> &#8212; which we regard as the seminal opinion in this field of law. The <i>Laker Airways</i> court did not suggest that its two stated rationales were the only ones that could justify issuing an international antisuit injunction. 731 F.2d at 927 (noting that \"[i]njunctions are most often necessary\" to protect the court's jurisdiction or to prevent evasion of the nation's important policies). Rather, the court indicated that it was prudent to use a wider-angled lens, making clear that the equitable considerations surrounding each request for an injunction should be examined carefully. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to provide guidance for the district courts, we spell out the manner in which our preferred approach operates. The gatekeeping inquiry is, of course, whether parallel suits involve the same parties and issues. Unless that condition is met, a court ordinarily should go no further and refuse the issuance of an international antisuit injunction. <i>See, e.g., China Trade,</i> 837 F.2d at 36; <i>Laker Airways,</i> 731 F.2d at 928; <i>see also</i> George A. Bermann, The Use of Anti-Suit Injunctions in International Litigation, 28 Colum. J. Transnat'l L. 589, 626 (1990) (stating that courts generally \"will not consider issuing anti-suit injunctions\" unless there are \"parallel local and foreign actions between the same parties over the same claim\"). If &#8212; and only if &#8212; this threshold condition is satisfied should the court proceed to consider all the facts and circumstances in order to decide whether an injunction is proper. In this analysis, considerations of international comity must be given substantial weight &#8212; and those considerations ordinarily establish a rebuttable presumption against the issuance of an order that has the effect of halting foreign judicial proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that the task of determining when a litigant has overcome this presumption is a difficult one. That is partly because comity is an elusive concept. The Supreme Court has defined it as \"the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard both to international duty and convenience, and to the rights of its own citizens or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws.\" <i>Hilton v. Guyot,</i> 159 U.S. 113, 164, 16 S.Ct. 139, 40 L.Ed. 95 (1895). Judge Aldrich trenchantly described it as \"a blend of courtesy and expedience.\" <i>Canadian Filters,</i> 412 F.2d at 578. Whatever definition is employed, it is pellucid that comity is not a matter of rigid obligation, but, rather, a protean concept of jurisdictional respect. And to complicate matters, comity, like beauty, sometimes is in the eye of the beholder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to add that although the definition of comity may be tenebrous, its importance could not be more clear. In an increasingly global economy, commercial transactions involving participants from many lands have become common fare. This world economic interdependence has highlighted the importance of comity, as international commerce depends to a large extent on \"the ability of merchants to predict the likely consequences of their conduct in overseas markets.\" <i>Gau Shan,</i> 956 F.2d at 1355. This predictability, in turn, depends on cooperation, reciprocity, and respect among nations. That helps to explain the enduring need for a presumption &#8212; albeit a rebuttable one &#8212; against the issuance of international antisuit injunctions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the final analysis, rebutting this presumption involves a continual give and take. In the course of that give and take, the presumption may be counterbalanced by other facts and factors particular to a specific case. These include (but are by no means limited to) such things as: the nature of the two actions (i.e., whether they are merely parallel or whether the foreign action is more properly classified as interdictory); the posture of the proceedings in the two countries; the conduct of the parties (including their good faith or lack thereof); the importance of the policies at stake in the litigation; and, finally, the extent to which the foreign action has the potential to undermine the forum court's ability to reach a just and speedy result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seen in this light, we agree that either the preservation of jurisdiction or the safeguarding of important national policies may afford a sufficient basis for the issuance of an international antisuit injunction. We do not, however, attach talismanic significance to concepts such as jurisdiction-stripping and insults to public policy. Instead, we hold that in every case a district court should examine the totality of the circumstances in deciding whether a particular case warrants the issuance of an international antisuit injunction. <i>See Laker Airways,</i> 731 F.2d at 927 (\"There are no precise rules governing the appropriateness of antisuit injunctions.\"). If, after giving due regard to the circumstances (including the salient interest in international comity), a court supportably finds that equitable considerations preponderate in favor of relief, it may issue an international antisuit injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Applying the Standards.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we ponder whether the district court acted within the realm of its discretion when it enjoined KPMG-B from pursuing the Belgian litigation. We conclude that it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court applied the traditional four-part test for preliminary injunctions. <i>See, e.g., Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc.,</i> 102 F.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir.1996) (describing the four-part test). Because this generic algorithm provides an awkward fit in cases involving international antisuit injunctions, district courts have no obligation to employ it in that context. <i>See Stonington Partners,</i> 310 F.3d at 129. Here, however, any methodological error was harmless: the district court, as part of its inquiry, carefully considered all of the critical factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not belabor the obvious. The parties and issues are substantially similar, thus satisfying the gatekeeping inquiry. The district judge acknowledged the importance of comity concerns in her published opinion. <i>See L &amp; H IV,</i> 2003 WL 22964378, at *2. A reading of the hearing transcript leaves no doubt that she was fully aware of the potential ramifications with respect to international comity and that she gave heavy weight to those concerns. However, she placed on the opposite pan of the scale the character of the foreign action, the public policy favoring the safeguarding of investors from securities fraud, the need to protect the court's own processes, and the balance of the equities. <i>Id.</i> at *1-*2. In the end, the court determined that those factors counterbalanced comity concerns in the peculiar circumstances of this case. <i>Id.</i> at *2. Having conducted an independent review, we find that determination fully supportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essential character of the Belgian action is easily discerned. In it, KPMG-B seeks to impose huge financial penalties on the securities fraud plaintiffs should they take any steps to enforce the district court's turnover order. This attempt to chill legitimate discovery by in terrorem tactics can scarcely be viewed as anything but an effort to \"quash the practical power of the United States courts.\" <i>Laker Airways,</i> 731 F.2d at 938; <i>see United States v. Davis,</i> 767 F.2d 1025, 1029 (2d Cir.1985) (upholding injunction of foreign proceeding where the \"sole purpose\" of instituting that proceeding \"was to block compliance with a legitimate trial subpoena\"). Thus, the foreign action is plainly interdictory in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, a party institutes a foreign action in a blatant attempt to evade the rightful authority of the forum court, the need for an antisuit injunction crests. <i>See Laker Airways,</i> 731 F.2d at 929-30. Fairly read, KPMG-B's petition to the Belgian tribunal seeks to arrest the progress of the securities fraud action by thwarting the very discovery that the district court, which is intimately familiar with the exigencies of the underlying case, has deemed essential to the continued prosecution of the action against <i>any</i> of the defendants. In technical terms, this may not constitute a frontal assault on the district court's jurisdiction, but the practical effect is the same. That is a matter of considerable import: a court has a right &#8212; indeed, a duty &#8212; to preserve its ability to do justice between the parties in cases that are legitimately before it. <i>See id.</i> at 930; <i>see also Davis,</i> 767 F.2d at 1039 (upholding an antisuit injunction as \"necessary to ensure a complete adjudication of the matter before it\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The equities also counsel in favor of affirming the district court's order. This is not a case in which a trial court is enabling a fishing expedition. The securities fraud plaintiffs have survived the PSLRA's heightened pleading requirements and, moreover, they have actually seen the documents that they seek. Consequently, they know that they are not fishing in an empty stream.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In weighing the equities, we also think it noteworthy that KPMG-B, not the securities fraud plaintiffs or the district court, set the stage for a crisis of comity. If KPMG-B had not filed a foreign petition calculated to generate interference with an ongoing American case, the district court would have had no need to issue a defensive injunction that sought only to preserve the court's ability to adjudicate the claims before it according to the law of the United States. And, finally, KPMG-B's actions are harder to accept because it had available to it other options for seeking resolution of its client confidentiality concerns. The most obvious choice was to pursue and exhaust its position in the federal judicial system before attempting to sidetrack that system. Alternatively, it could have sought clarification from the Belgian courts without raising the stakes to a level that necessarily precipitated a direct conflict with the pending securities fraud action. It eschewed these options. Having called the tune, it hardly seems inequitable that KPMG-B must now pay the piper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">KPMG-B's remaining arguments need not occupy us for long. First, it posits that the district court erred when it entered the antisuit injunction prior to reviewing the magistrate judge's turnover order (including his assessment of the Belgian law issue). This argument is hopeless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District courts have broad discretion in determining the sequence of their rulings. <i>Cf. Dynamic Image Techs., Inc. v. United States,</i> 221 F.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir.2000) (noting trial court's substantial discretion in deciding when to rule upon particular motions). Here, moreover, KPMG-B left the district court no practical alternative. By electing to file its petition in Belgium before it lodged an objection to the magistrate judge's decision, KPMG-B effectively dictated the sequence of subsequent events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">KPMG-B next contends that the lower court erred as a matter of law by failing to give due regard to the possible use of letters rogatory as a means of securing the requested documents. This contention lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While letters rogatory are among the discovery devices available in a federal court, parties are not required to resort to them come what may. <i>See Soci&#233;t&#233; Nationale Industrielle A&#233;rospatiale v. United States Dist. Court,</i> 482 U.S. 522, 543-44, 107 S.Ct. 2542, 96 L.Ed.2d 461 (1987). The transcripts of the relevant hearings make it crystal clear that, in this instance, the district court fully considered, and flatly rejected, the argument that letters rogatory would serve as a satisfactory substitute for a turnover order. Bearing in mind the district court's superior coign of vantage, we are loath to second-guess its pragmatic judgment. Under the best of circumstances, letters rogatory are burdensome, costly, and time-consuming. <i>Id.</i> at 542, 107 S.Ct. 2542. For various reasons &#8212; including the fact that Belgium is not a signatory to the Hague Convention<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> &#8212; the circumstances here are far from ideal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can we accept KPMG-B's related contention that, as a matter of law, no international antisuit injunction can issue if the forum court's goal can be achieved in some other way. While we encourage trial courts to search out alternatives that might avoid the need to issue antisuit injunctions, we will not force them to exhaust remote possibilities. Here, there is no compelling justification for overriding the district court's considered judgment that letters rogatory are not a reasonably equivalent alternative to the turnover order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, KPMG-B asserts that because the securities fraud plaintiffs will eventually gain access to the requested documents even in the absence of a turnover order, the injunction was improvidently issued. This assertion elevates hope over likelihood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">KPMG-B's thesis is, in substance, that the work papers will be made available by the Belgian prosecutor at the conclusion of the criminal investigation. But there is a rub: we have no reliable way of knowing when that investigation will end and, in all events, the record is unclear as to whether the outcome of the investigation will (or will not) affect the availability of the work papers. We do not think that a district court must bring the resolution of a case within its jurisdiction to a dead halt in the hope that the resolution of a foreign criminal proceeding at an uncertain future date may alleviate the need for a discovery order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not mean to minimize the potential difficulty of the situation that KPMG-B faces. To some extent, however, that situation is the natural consequence of its decision to ply its wares in the lucrative American marketplace. Having elected to establish a major presence in the United States, KPMG-B must have anticipated that it would be subject to suit in this country (and, thus, subject to pretrial discovery rules that are pandemic to the American justice system). <i>See</i> Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law &#167; 442, reporters' note 1 (1987) (noting \"that persons who do business in the United States ... are subject to the burdens as well as the benefits of United States law, including the laws on discovery\"). While courts should \"take care to demonstrate due respect for any special problem confronted by [a] foreign litigant on account of its nationality,\" <i>Soci&#233;t&#233; Nationale,</i> 482 U.S. at 546, 107 S.Ct. 2542, a foreign national that chooses to engage in business in the United States likewise must demonstrate due respect for the operation of the American judicial system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the district court acted within the encincture of its discretion in enjoining KPMG-B from pursuing its Belgian litigation. In the last analysis, an international antisuit injunction, like any other injunction, is an equitable remedy designed \"to bring the scales into balance.\" <i>Rosario-Torres v. Hernandez-Colon,</i> 889 F.2d 314, 323 (1st Cir.1989) (en banc). In this case, the district court acted defensively to protect its own authority from an interdictory strike and we are confident that, in doing so, the court kept the balance steady and true.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>We affirm the district court's injunction order and vacate the partial stay of that order previously issued by this court.

As the imperatives of transnational business shrink the size of the globe, the task of devising an effective yet respectful paradigm for easing this friction becomes more and more urgent. The instant appeal brings the titration into full focus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The genesis of the problem in this case lies with an auditing engagement accepted by Klynveld Peat Marwick Goerdeler Bedrijfsrevisoren (KPMG-B), a Belgian firm that served as the auditor for a publicly-traded company, Lernout &amp; Hauspie Speech Products, N.V. (L &amp; H). L &amp; H's collapse precipitated a flood of actions against KPMG-B and others in the courts of this country, alleging massive securities fraud. KPMG-B refused to produce relevant auditing records and associated work papers, asserting that to do so would violate Belgian law. A magistrate judge rejected this assertion and ordered production. <i>See In re Lernout &amp; Hauspie Sec. Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">348</span></span> (D.Mass.2003) (<i>L &amp; H III</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response, KPMG-B repaired to a Belgian court requesting that substantial penalties be imposed on those who might \"take any step of a procedural or other nature in order to proceed with the discovery-procedure.\" The plaintiffs in the pending American litigation (who had obtained the turnover order in the first instance) implored the district court to enjoin KPMG-B from pursuing the Belgian action. The district court obliged. <i>See In re Lernout &amp; Hauspie Sec. Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22964378</span></span>, at *2 (D.Mass.

We issued a partial stay of the antisuit injunction and expedited the appeal. We now affirm the district court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, this appeal arises out of a welter of cases having a common theme: the allegation that KPMG-B and others perpetrated large-scale securities fraud leading to L &amp; H's collapse. Those cases include several class actions. Some of them were commenced in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts and others were transferred to that district. <i>See, e.g., Filler v. Lernout,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">227079</span></span> (D.Del. Feb.8, 2002). The district court has consolidated all the cases. It would serve no useful purpose to dissect the plaintiffs' allegations, and we urge the reader who thirsts for more detailed background knowledge to consult the district court's published opinions. <i>See, e.g., In re Lernout &amp; Hauspie Sec. Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2425955\"><a href=\"/opinion/2425955/in-re-lernout-hauspie-securities-litigation/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">100</span></a></span> (D.Mass.2002) (<i>L &amp; H I</i>). We rehearse here only those developments needed to frame the issues on appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">KPMG-B is a target of an ongoing criminal investigation in Belgium, which arises out of the L &amp; H fiasco. It is also a principal defendant in the aforedescribed securities fraud litigation. KPMG-B has not disputed the district court's in personam jurisdiction. It did seek to secure dismissal of the securities fraud litigation on forum non conveniens grounds, but failed in that effort. <i>See L &amp; H II,</i> 230 F.Supp.2d at 176. At the same time, the district court determined that the consolidated complaint against KPMG-B satisfied the stringent pleading requirements of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), 15 U.S.C. &#167; 78u-4(b)(2), and Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 9(b). <i>L &amp; H II,</i> 230 F.Supp.2d at 165-66.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once past these threshold issues, the securities fraud plaintiffs embarked on pretrial discovery. In September of 2002, they served document requests for KPMG-B's work papers. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 34. The plaintiffs did not get very far; KPMG-B refused to comply with the requests, asseverating that Belgian law prohibited it from divulging the information sought. While this game of cat and mouse was taking place, the plaintiffs, acting on KPMG-B's advice, became civil coprosecutors in the ongoing Belgian criminal investigation. Through this participation, they were able to examine all the documents that were not deemed confidential by the Belgian prosecutor, but they were not permitted to copy documents for use in the securities fraud litigation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tantalized by their glimpse of the work papers, the securities fraud plaintiffs moved to compel their production. A magistrate judge took briefing and heard argument on the applicability of and exceptions to the Belgian secrecy law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2-1\" id=\"fn2-1_ref\">2</a> On November 13, 2003, he rejected KPMG-B's arguments and ordered production of the work papers on or before the close of business on December 1, 2003.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 27, 2003 &#8212; Thanksgiving day &#8212; KPMG-B filed an ex parte petition with a court in Brussels, seeking to enjoin the securities fraud plaintiffs from \"taking any step\" to proceed with the requested discovery. To ensure compliance, they asked the Belgian court to impose a fine of one million Euros for each violation of the proposed injunction.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The Belgian court refused to act ex parte; instead, it directed that notice be provided to the securities fraud plaintiffs and scheduled a hearing for December 16, 2003. On December 1, KPMG-B gave notice of the institution of the Belgian action to the securities fraud plaintiffs. It also filed an objection to the magistrate judge's decision. That objection is still pending in the district court (there is, among other things, a disagreement as to its timeliness). Finally, KPMG-B moved to stay the turnover order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Faced with the threat of extravagant fines, the securities fraud plaintiffs sought the district court's protection. On December 9, the magistrate judge issued a report and recommendation urging the entry of an order enjoining KPMG-B from proceeding with its Belgian action. The district judge held a hearing two days later and issued an antisuit injunction, the full text of which is reproduced below:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Court preliminarily enjoins KPMG-Belgium from proceeding with its writ, orders KPMG-Belgium to withdraw forthwith its writ in the Court of First Instance of Brussels and orders it not to proceed with the hearing scheduled on December 16, 2003. KPMG-Belgium shall file proof of compliance with this order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>L &amp; H IV,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22964378</span></span>, at *2. Hot on the heels of this order, the magistrate judge denied KPMG-B's motion to stay the turnover order, branding that motion untimely. <i>In re Lernout &amp; Hauspie Sec. Litig.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">219</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.R.D.</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></span>, 30-31 (D.Mass.2003) (<i>L &amp; H V</i>). KPMG-B immediately appealed the entry of the antisuit injunction. We granted a limited stay of the injunction, permitting KPMG-B to appear at the December 16 hearing in Brussels for the sole purpose of requesting a continuance. The Belgian court has been fully cooperative, and the foreign action has been continued periodically during the pendency of this expedited appeal. There has been no further action with regard to the turnover order itself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. STANDARD OF REVIEW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A grant of a preliminary injunction typically receives deferential review. <i>McGuire v. Reilly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199554\"><a href=\"/opinion/199554/mcguire-v-reilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">260</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.2001). The trial court's order will stand unless it \"mistook the law, clearly erred in its factual assessments, or otherwise abused its discretion in granting the interim relief.\" <i>Id.</i> In our view, however, international antisuit injunctions &#8212; which involve important considerations of comity &#8212; warrant a heightened level of appellate review. <i>Cf. United States v. O'Brien,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536166\"><a href=\"/opinion/536166/united-states-v-edward-obrien/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">810</span></a></span>, 814 (1st Cir.1990) (considering the importance of the interest at stake when ascertaining the appropriate standard of review). Consequently, we deem it appropriate to conduct an independent review of the justification for the issuance of an international antisuit injunction. This is an \"intermediate level of scrutiny, more rigorous than the abuse-of-discretion or clear-error standards, but stopping short of plenary or <i>de novo</i> review.\" <i>United States v. Tortora,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"553834\"><a href=\"/opinion/553834/united-states-v-carmen-a-tortora/\"><span class=\"volume\">922</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">880</span></a></span>, 883 (1st Cir.1990). Given our chosen standard of review, we cede a modest degree of deference to the trier's exercise of discretion, but \"we will not hesitate to act upon our independent judgment if it appears that a mistake has been made.\" <i>El Dia, Inc. v. Hernandez Colon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"583336\"><a href=\"/opinion/583336/el-dia-inc-v-rafael-hernandez-colon/\"><span class=\"volume\">963</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></a></span>, 492 (1st Cir.1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Determining the appropriateness of an international antisuit injunction is a highly nuanced exercise. An inquiring court must find a way to accommodate conflicting, mutually inconsistent national policies without unduly interfering with the judicial processes of a foreign sovereign. <i>See Laker Airways Ltd. v. Sabena, Belgian World Airlines,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"433759\"><a href=\"/opinion/433759/laker-airways-limited-a-foreign-corporation-v-sabena-belgian-world/\"><span class=\"volume\">731</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">909</span></a></span>, 916 (D.C.Cir.1984). This task is particularly formidable given the absence of guidance from the Supreme Court and the paucity of precedent in this circuit; the Justices have not spoken to the criteria for granting an international antisuit injunction and this court has passed on that question only once (and then, glancingly). <i>See Canadian Filters (Harwich) Ltd. v. Lear-Siegler, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"285385\"><a href=\"/opinion/285385/canadian-filters-harwich-limited-v-lear-siegler-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">577</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1969). We begin our analysis by articulating the standards that ought to govern the question. We then apply those standards to the case at hand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Articulating the Standards.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is common ground that federal courts have the power to enjoin those subject to their personal jurisdiction from pursuing litigation before foreign tribunals. <i>See, e.g., Kaepa, Inc. v. Achilles Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712930\"><a href=\"/opinion/712930/kaepa-inc-v-achilles-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">76</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">624</span></a></span>, 626 (5th Cir.1996); <i>China Trade &amp; Dev. Corp. v. M.V. Choong Yong,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"500045\"><a href=\"/opinion/500045/china-trade-and-development-corporation-chung-hua-trade-and-development/\"><span class=\"volume\">837</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">33</span></a></span>, 35 (2d Cir.1987). The exercise of that power must be tempered, however, by the accepted proposition that parallel proceedings on the same in personam claim generally should be allowed to proceed simultaneously. <i>Laker Airways,</i> 731 F.2d at 926. The decisional calculus must take account of this presumption in favor of concurrent jurisdiction. It also must take account of considerations of international comity. After all, even though an international antisuit injunction operates only against the parties, it effectively restricts the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign's courts. <i>See, e.g., China Trade,</i> 837 F.2d at 35-36.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Federal courts have been consentient in endorsing these principles. Beyond that point, however, the waters grow murky. The courts of appeals have differed as to the legal standards to be employed in determining whether the power to enjoin an international proceeding should be exercised. Two basic views have emerged. For ease in reference, we shall call the more permissive of these views the liberal approach and the more restrictive of them the conservative approach. <i>See</i> Note, Antisuit Injunctions and International Comity, 71 Va. L.Rev. 1039, 1049-51 (1985) (using this nomenclature).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The liberal approach has been championed by two courts of appeals: the Fifth Circuit, <i>Kaepa,</i> 76 F.3d at 627, and the Ninth Circuit, <i>Seattle Totems Hockey Club, Inc. v. Nat'l Hockey League,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"391958\"><a href=\"/opinion/391958/seattle-totems-hockey-club-inc-eldred-w-barnes-and-vincent-h-d-abbey/\"><span class=\"volume\">652</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">852</span></a></span>, 855-56 (9th Cir.1981). In addition, the Seventh Circuit has pronounced itself \"incline[d] toward\" the liberal view. <i>Philips Med. Sys. Int'l v. Bruetman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"656168\"><a href=\"/opinion/656168/philips-medical-systems-international-b-v-v-martin-e-bruetman/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">600</span></a></span>, 605 (7th Cir.1993). Under this approach, an international antisuit injunction is appropriate whenever there is a duplication of parties and issues and the court determines that the prosecution of simultaneous proceedings would frustrate the speedy and efficient determination of the case. <i>Kaepa,</i> 76 F.3d at 627; <i>Seattle Totems,</i> 652 F.2d at 856. We do not mean to suggest that courts employing the liberal approach do not give weight to considerations of international comity. For the most part, they do &#8212; but they tend to define that interest in a relatively narrow manner and to assign it only modest weight. <i>See, e.g., Kaepa,</i> 76 F.3d at 627 (noting that an international antisuit injunction does not \"actually threaten relations\" between the two involved nations).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Four courts of appeals have espoused the conservative approach for gauging the propriety of international antisuit injunctions. <i>See Stonington Partners, Inc. v. Lernout &amp; Hauspie Speech Prods.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779785\"><a href=\"/opinion/779785/stonington-partners-inc-stonington-capital-appreciation-1994-fund-lp/\"><span class=\"volume\">310</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">118</span></a></span>, 126 (3d Cir.2002); <i>Gau Shan Co. v. Bankers Trust Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"578174\"><a href=\"/opinion/578174/gau-shan-company-ltd-v-bankers-trust-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">956</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1349</span></a></span>, 1355 (6th Cir.1992); <i>China Trade,</i> 837 F.2d at 36 (2d Cir.); <i>Laker Airways,</i> 731 F.2d at 927 (D.C.Cir.). Under this approach, the critical questions anent the issuance of an international antisuit injunction are whether the foreign action either imperils the jurisdiction of the forum court or threatens some strong national policy. <i>See, e.g., Stonington Partners,</i> 310 F.3d at 127; <i>China Trade,</i> 837 F.2d at 36. This approach accords appreciably greater weight to considerations of international comity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject the liberal approach. We deem international comity an important integer in the decisional calculus &#8212; and the liberal approach assigns too low a priority to that interest. In the bargain, it undermines the age-old presumption in favor of concurrent parallel proceedings &#8212; a value judgment that leaves us uneasy &#8212; and presumes that public policy always favors allowing a suit pending in an American court to go forward without any substantial impediment. To cinch matters, this approach gives far too easy passage to international antisuit injunctions. We understand that the judicial process is a cornerstone of the American way of life &#8212; but in an area that raises significant separation of powers concerns and implicates international relations, we believe that the law calls for a more cautious and measured approach.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conservative approach has more to commend it. First, it recognizes the rebuttable presumption against issuing international antisuit injunctions (and, thus, honors the presumption favoring the maintenance of parallel proceedings). Second, it is more respectful of principles of international comity. Third, it compels an inquiring court to balance competing policy considerations. Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; it fits snugly with the logic of <i>Canadian Filters,</i> in which we said that issuing an international antisuit injunction is a step that should \"be taken only with care and great restraint\" and with the recognition that international comity is a fundamental principle deserving of substantial deference. 412 F.2d at 578.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We stop short, however, of an uncritical acceptance of the conservative approach. The recent expositions of that approach have come to regard the two main rationales upon which international antisuit injunctions may be grounded &#8212; preservation of jurisdiction and protection of important national policies &#8212; as exclusive. <i>See, e.g., Gen. Elec. Co. v. Deutz Ag,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775409\"><a href=\"/opinion/775409/general-electric-company-v-deutz-ag/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">144</span></a></span>, 160-61 (3d Cir.2001) (describing these as the \"only\" justifications that can support the issuance of such an injunction); <i>Gau Shan,</i> 956 F.2d at 1355 (similar). We are uncomfortable with this gloss, for it evinces a certain woodenness. In our view, the sensitive and fact-specific nature of the inquiry counsels against the use of inflexible rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We therefore reject this reworking of the conservative approach and instead endorse its traditional version. That version is not only more flexible but also more consistent with <i>Laker Airways</i> &#8212; which we regard as the seminal opinion in this field of law. The <i>Laker Airways</i> court did not suggest that its two stated rationales were the only ones that could justify issuing an international antisuit injunction. 731 F.2d at 927 (noting that \"[i]njunctions are most often necessary\" to protect the court's jurisdiction or to prevent evasion of the nation's important policies). Rather, the court indicated that it was prudent to use a wider-angled lens, making clear that the equitable considerations surrounding each request for an injunction should be examined carefully. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to provide guidance for the district courts, we spell out the manner in which our preferred approach operates. The gatekeeping inquiry is, of course, whether parallel suits involve the same parties and issues. Unless that condition is met, a court ordinarily should go no further and refuse the issuance of an international antisuit injunction. <i>See, e.g., China Trade,</i> 837 F.2d at 36; <i>Laker Airways,</i> 731 F.2d at 928; <i>see also</i> George A. Bermann, The Use of Anti-Suit Injunctions in International Litigation, 28 Colum. J. Transnat'l L. 589, 626 (1990) (stating that courts generally \"will not consider issuing anti-suit injunctions\" unless there are \"parallel local and foreign actions between the same parties over the same claim\"). If &#8212; and only if &#8212; this threshold condition is satisfied should the court proceed to consider all the facts and circumstances in order to decide whether an injunction is proper. In this analysis, considerations of international comity must be given substantial weight &#8212; and those considerations ordinarily establish a rebuttable presumption against the issuance of an order that has the effect of halting foreign judicial proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We acknowledge that the task of determining when a litigant has overcome this presumption is a difficult one. That is partly because comity is an elusive concept. The Supreme Court has defined it as \"the recognition which one nation allows within its territory to the legislative, executive or judicial acts of another nation, having due regard both to international duty and convenience, and to the rights of its own citizens or of other persons who are under the protection of its laws.\" <i>Hilton v. Guyot,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"94252\"><a href=\"/opinion/94252/hilton-v-guyot/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">113</span></a></span>, 164, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">16</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed.</span> <span class=\"page\">95</span></span> (1895). Judge Aldrich trenchantly described it as \"a blend of courtesy and expedience.\" <i>Canadian Filters,</i> 412 F.2d at 578. Whatever definition is employed, it is pellucid that comity is not a matter of rigid obligation, but, rather, a protean concept of jurisdictional respect. And to complicate matters, comity, like beauty, sometimes is in the eye of the beholder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to add that although the definition of comity may be tenebrous, its importance could not be more clear. In an increasingly global economy, commercial transactions involving participants from many lands have become common fare. This world economic interdependence has highlighted the importance of comity, as international commerce depends to a large extent on \"the ability of merchants to predict the likely consequences of their conduct in overseas markets.\" <i>Gau Shan,</i> 956 F.2d at 1355. This predictability, in turn, depends on cooperation, reciprocity, and respect among nations. That helps to explain the enduring need for a presumption &#8212; albeit a rebuttable one &#8212; against the issuance of international antisuit injunctions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the final analysis, rebutting this presumption involves a continual give and take. In the course of that give and take, the presumption may be counterbalanced by other facts and factors particular to a specific case. These include (but are by no means limited to) such things as: the nature of the two actions (i.e., whether they are merely parallel or whether the foreign action is more properly classified as interdictory); the posture of the proceedings in the two countries; the conduct of the parties (including their good faith or lack thereof); the importance of the policies at stake in the litigation; and, finally, the extent to which the foreign action has the potential to undermine the forum court's ability to reach a just and speedy result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seen in this light, we agree that either the preservation of jurisdiction or the safeguarding of important national policies may afford a sufficient basis for the issuance of an international antisuit injunction. We do not, however, attach talismanic significance to concepts such as jurisdiction-stripping and insults to public policy. Instead, we hold that in every case a district court should examine the totality of the circumstances in deciding whether a particular case warrants the issuance of an international antisuit injunction. <i>See Laker Airways,</i> 731 F.2d at 927 (\"There are no precise rules governing the appropriateness of antisuit injunctions.\"). If, after giving due regard to the circumstances (including the salient interest in international comity), a court supportably finds that equitable considerations preponderate in favor of relief, it may issue an international antisuit injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>Applying the Standards.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we ponder whether the district court acted within the realm of its discretion when it enjoined KPMG-B from pursuing the Belgian litigation. We conclude that it did.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The lower court applied the traditional four-part test for preliminary injunctions. <i>See, e.g., Ross-Simons of Warwick, Inc. v. Baccarat, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">102</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></span>, 15 (1st Cir.1996) (describing the four-part test). Because this generic algorithm provides an awkward fit in cases involving international antisuit injunctions, district courts have no obligation to employ it in that context. <i>See Stonington Partners,</i> 310 F.3d at 129. Here, however, any methodological error was harmless: the district court, as part of its inquiry, carefully considered all of the critical factors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not belabor the obvious. The parties and issues are substantially similar, thus satisfying the gatekeeping inquiry. The district judge acknowledged the importance of comity concerns in her published opinion. <i>See L &amp; H IV,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2003</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">22964378</span></span>, at *2. A reading of the hearing transcript leaves no doubt that she was fully aware of the potential ramifications with respect to international comity and that she gave heavy weight to those concerns. However, she placed on the opposite pan of the scale the character of the foreign action, the public policy favoring the safeguarding of investors from securities fraud, the need to protect the court's own processes, and the balance of the equities. <i>Id.</i> at *1-*2. In the end, the court determined that those factors counterbalanced comity concerns in the peculiar circumstances of this case. <i>Id.</i> at *2. Having conducted an independent review, we find that determination fully supportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The essential character of the Belgian action is easily discerned. In it, KPMG-B seeks to impose huge financial penalties on the securities fraud plaintiffs should they take any steps to enforce the district court's turnover order. This attempt to chill legitimate discovery by in terrorem tactics can scarcely be viewed as anything but an effort to \"quash the practical power of the United States courts.\" <i>Laker Airways,</i> 731 F.2d at 938; <i>see United States v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"455770\"><a href=\"/opinion/455770/united-states-v-george-g-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">767</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1025</span></a></span>, 1029 (2d Cir.1985) (upholding injunction of foreign proceeding where the \"sole purpose\" of instituting that proceeding \"was to block compliance with a legitimate trial subpoena\"). Thus, the foreign action is plainly interdictory in nature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where, as here, a party institutes a foreign action in a blatant attempt to evade the rightful authority of the forum court, the need for an antisuit injunction crests. <i>See Laker Airways,</i> 731 F.2d at 929-30. Fairly read, KPMG-B's petition to the Belgian tribunal seeks to arrest the progress of the securities fraud action by thwarting the very discovery that the district court, which is intimately familiar with the exigencies of the underlying case, has deemed essential to the continued prosecution of the action against <i>any</i> of the defendants. In technical terms, this may not constitute a frontal assault on the district court's jurisdiction, but the practical effect is the same. That is a matter of considerable import: a court has a right &#8212; indeed, a duty &#8212; to preserve its ability to do justice between the parties in cases that are legitimately before it. <i>See id.</i> at 930; <i>see also Davis,</i> 767 F.2d at 1039 (upholding an antisuit injunction as \"necessary to ensure a complete adjudication of the matter before it\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The equities also counsel in favor of affirming the district court's order. This is not a case in which a trial court is enabling a fishing expedition. The securities fraud plaintiffs have survived the PSLRA's heightened pleading requirements and, moreover, they have actually seen the documents that they seek. Consequently, they know that they are not fishing in an empty stream.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In weighing the equities, we also think it noteworthy that KPMG-B, not the securities fraud plaintiffs or the district court, set the stage for a crisis of comity. If KPMG-B had not filed a foreign petition calculated to generate interference with an ongoing American case, the district court would have had no need to issue a defensive injunction that sought only to preserve the court's ability to adjudicate the claims before it according to the law of the United States. And, finally, KPMG-B's actions are harder to accept because it had available to it other options for seeking resolution of its client confidentiality concerns. The most obvious choice was to pursue and exhaust its position in the federal judicial system before attempting to sidetrack that system. Alternatively, it could have sought clarification from the Belgian courts without raising the stakes to a level that necessarily precipitated a direct conflict with the pending securities fraud action. It eschewed these options. Having called the tune, it hardly seems inequitable that KPMG-B must now pay the piper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">KPMG-B's remaining arguments need not occupy us for long. First, it posits that the district court erred when it entered the antisuit injunction prior to reviewing the magistrate judge's turnover order (including his assessment of the Belgian law issue). This argument is hopeless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">District courts have broad discretion in determining the sequence of their rulings. <i>Cf. Dynamic Image Techs., Inc. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199029\"><a href=\"/opinion/199029/dynamic-image-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">221</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2000) (noting trial court's substantial discretion in deciding when to rule upon particular motions). Here, moreover, KPMG-B left the district court no practical alternative. By electing to file its petition in Belgium before it lodged an objection to the magistrate judge's decision, KPMG-B effectively dictated the sequence of subsequent events.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">KPMG-B next contends that the lower court erred as a matter of law by failing to give due regard to the possible use of letters rogatory as a means of securing the requested documents. This contention lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While letters rogatory are among the discovery devices available in a federal court, parties are not required to resort to them come what may. <i>See Soci&#233;t&#233; Nationale Industrielle A&#233;rospatiale v. United States Dist. Court,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111922\"><a href=\"/opinion/111922/societe-nat-ind-aero-v-us-dist-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">482</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">522</span></a></span>, 543-44, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111922\"><a href=\"/opinion/111922/societe-nat-ind-aero-v-us-dist-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span> (1987). The transcripts of the relevant hearings make it crystal clear that, in this instance, the district court fully considered, and flatly rejected, the argument that letters rogatory would serve as a satisfactory substitute for a turnover order. Bearing in mind the district court's superior coign of vantage, we are loath to second-guess its pragmatic judgment. Under the best of circumstances, letters rogatory are burdensome, costly, and time-consuming. <i>Id.</i> at 542, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111922\"><a href=\"/opinion/111922/societe-nat-ind-aero-v-us-dist-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2542</span></a></span>. For various reasons &#8212; including the fact that Belgium is not a signatory to the Hague Convention<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> &#8212; the circumstances here are far from ideal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor can we accept KPMG-B's related contention that, as a matter of law, no international antisuit injunction can issue if the forum court's goal can be achieved in some other way. While we encourage trial courts to search out alternatives that might avoid the need to issue antisuit injunctions, we will not force them to exhaust remote possibilities. Here, there is no compelling justification for overriding the district court's considered judgment that letters rogatory are not a reasonably equivalent alternative to the turnover order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, KPMG-B asserts that because the securities fraud plaintiffs will eventually gain access to the requested documents even in the absence of a turnover order, the injunction was improvidently issued. This assertion elevates hope over likelihood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">KPMG-B's thesis is, in substance, that the work papers will be made available by the Belgian prosecutor at the conclusion of the criminal investigation. But there is a rub: we have no reliable way of knowing when that investigation will end and, in all events, the record is unclear as to whether the outcome of the investigation will (or will not) affect the availability of the work papers. We do not think that a district court must bring the resolution of a case within its jurisdiction to a dead halt in the hope that the resolution of a foreign criminal proceeding at an uncertain future date may alleviate the need for a discovery order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not mean to minimize the potential difficulty of the situation that KPMG-B faces. To some extent, however, that situation is the natural consequence of its decision to ply its wares in the lucrative American marketplace. Having elected to establish a major presence in the United States, KPMG-B must have anticipated that it would be subject to suit in this country (and, thus, subject to pretrial discovery rules that are pandemic to the American justice system). <i>See</i> Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law &#167; 442, reporters' note 1 (1987) (noting \"that persons who do business in the United States ... are subject to the burdens as well as the benefits of United States law, including the laws on discovery\"). While courts should \"take care to demonstrate due respect for any special problem confronted by [a] foreign litigant on account of its nationality,\" <i>Soci&#233;t&#233; Nationale,</i> 482 U.S. at 546, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111922\"><a href=\"/opinion/111922/societe-nat-ind-aero-v-us-dist-court/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

For the foregoing reasons, we hold that the district court acted within the encincture of its discretion in enjoining KPMG-B from pursuing its Belgian litigation. In the last analysis, an international antisuit injunction, like any other injunction, is an equitable remedy designed \"to bring the scales into balance.\" <i>Rosario-Torres v.

In this case, the district court acted defensively to protect its own authority from an interdictory strike and we are confident that, in doing so, the court kept the balance steady and true.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>We affirm the district court's injunction order and vacate the partial stay of that order previously issued by this court.
