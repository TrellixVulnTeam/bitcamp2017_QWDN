Jaime Pieras, Jr., U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                    Torruella, Stahl and Lipez,\n                          Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Julio C. Alejandro on brief for appellant.\n     Irene S. Soroeta-Kodesh, Solicitor General; Leticia\nCasalduc-Rabell, Deputy Solicitor General; Zaira Z. Girón-Anadón,\nDeputy Solicitor General; Susana I. Peñagarcíano-Brown, Assistant\nSolicitor General, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                             July 23, 2009\n\f           Per Curiam.         This is an appeal from the dismissal of a\n\ncomplaint alleging that the lead plaintiff, Vidal Pastrana-López\n\n(\"Pastrana\"),1 was terminated from his position in the Puerto Rico\n\nFire Department in retaliation for publicly expressing his views\n\nconcerning corruption at the Department.              The sole issue on appeal\n\nis   whether   the     district   court      erred   in   determining   that   the\n\napplicable one-year statute of limitations began to run when\n\nPastrana was notified of his proposed termination and that the\n\ncomplaint,     filed    more    than   one    year   after   that   notice,    was\n\ntherefore untimely.       For the reasons discussed below, we conclude\n\nthat the district court did err in that respect--at least on the\n\npresent record.\n\n           The parties correctly agree that section 1983 claims\n\ncarry a one-year statute of limitations in Puerto Rico, Morán Vega\n\nv. Cruz Burgos, 537 F.3d 14, 20 (1st Cir. 2008); that such claims\n\naccrue \"'when the plaintiff knows, or has reason to know of the\n\ninjury on which the action is based,'\" id. (quoting Marrero-\n\nGutierrez v. Molina, 491 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007)); and that, in\n\nwrongful discharge cases, a plaintiff has the requisite knowledge\n\nwhen he \"learns of the decision to terminate his employment,\"\n\nRivera-Muriente v. Agosto-Alicea, 959 F.2d 349, 352-54 (1st Cir.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      The other plaintiffs are Pastrana's wife and their conjugal\npartnership.\n\n                                       -2-\n\f1992).       The   question   here   is     when    Pastrana    learned   of   that\n\ndecision.\n\n             The district court held that Pastrana learned of the\n\ndecision on February 23, 2007, when he received a letter from the\n\nFire Chief, which \"put [him] on notice that he was being dismissed,\n\nand as such, marks the date of the accrual of [plaintiffs']\n\nclaim[s].\"     Although the court acknowledged that Pastrana's \"pre-\n\ntermination hearing was held at a later date,\" that fact \"d[id] not\n\nalter [the court's] analysis.\"\n\n             In discounting the later dates of the pre-termination\n\nhearing and of the post-hearing notice of dismissal that followed\n\nit, the district court relied primarily on our decision in Rivera-\n\nMuriente.     That reliance was misplaced.\n\n             In Rivera-Muriente, the plaintiff Rivera's alleged injury\n\nwas   that    he   was   deprived    of    his     employment   without   a    pre-\n\ntermination hearing.       Rivera-Muriente, 959 F.2d at 353.              We held\n\nthat Rivera had notice of that injury when he was \"cashiered\"\n\n(i.e., given his accumulated vacation pay) and that the statute of\n\nlimitations therefore began to run on that date, despite the fact\n\nthat he had never received any written notice of his termination or\n\nany pre-termination hearing.          Id. at 353-54.           What mattered, we\n\nheld, was that, by that date, he \"reliably knew that he had lost\n\nhis job.\"     Id. at 354.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f           By contrast, at least on the present record, it cannot be\n\nsaid that Pastrana \"reliably knew\" of his termination when he\n\nreceived the February 23rd letter.               Rather, according to the\n\ncomplaint, which is unrefuted by any evidence of the actual letter\n\nitself,   the   letter    was   entitled   \"I    Propose   to   Dismiss   You\"\n\n(emphasis added).        Only after Pastrana requested and received a\n\npre-termination hearing, was he notified, by letter dated April 2,\n\n2007,2 of his actual termination.               It was only then that he\n\n\"reliably knew\" that he had been terminated.                Because       the\n\nplaintiffs filed their complaint within a year of that notice, the\n\ndistrict court erred in holding that the complaint was time-barred.\n\nAccordingly, the dismissal is vacated and the case remanded for\n\nfurther proceedings.       See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The only copy of that notice in the district court record is\nin Spanish. Although the appellants included a certified English\ntranslation of that document in their appendix, we cannot consider\nit. Sanchez-Figueroa v. Banco Popular, 527 F.3d 209, 214 n.7 (1st\nCir. 2008), cert. denied, 129 S. Ct. 1328 (2009).\n\n                                    -4-\n\f",
