Paul J. Barbadoro,         U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     John Edward Schomaker on brief pro se.\n     Evan J. Roth, Special Attorney on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                             June 9, 2009\n\f          Per Curiam.    John Schomaker appeals pro se the district\n\ncourt's grant of summary judgment to defendants, the United States,\n\nAssistant United States Attorney Arnold H. Huftalen, and John and\n\nJane Doe property officers employed by the U.S. Attorney's Office\n\nfor the District of New Hampshire.        In the underlying complaint,\n\nSchomaker asserted constitutional and state law tort claims under\n\nBivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents of Fed. Bureau of Narcotics, 403\n\nU.S. 388 (1971), the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1346(b),\n\n2671-2680, (\"FTCA\") and New Hampshire state law, arising from\n\ndefendants' failure to return, and their subsequent destruction of,\n\npersonal property seized in 1997 during the execution of a valid\n\nsearch   warrant   in   connection     with   a   criminal   prosecution;\n\ndefendants conceded that Schomaker was entitled to the return of at\n\nleast some of the seized property at the conclusion of the criminal\n\nproceedings against him and that they received but failed to act on\n\nSchomaker's request for the return of that property. Our review of\n\nthe entry of summary judgment is de novo.         See Goodwin v. C.N.J.,\n\nInc., 436 F.3d 44, 49 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          On appeal, Schomaker's primary arguments are that the\n\ndistrict court erred in determining the date his Fourth Amendment\n\nclaim accrued and in failing to address whether his due process\n\nrights were violated based solely on lack of notice prior to the\n\ndestruction of his property.         He also appears to challenge the\n\ndistrict court's determination that, under the Westfall Act, 28\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\fU.S.C. § 2679(d), defendant Huftalen was entitled to immunity with\n\nregard to the state law tort claims because he was acting within\n\nthe scope of his employment at all relevant times.                    See Aversa v.\n\nUnited States, 99 F.3d 1200, 1207 (1st Cir. 1996).                         We have\n\ncarefully reviewed the record and the parties' submissions and,\n\nsubstantially for the reasons stated in the district court's May\n\n13, 2008, Memorandum and Order, we affirm.\n\n                                       DISCUSSION\n\nI. Accrual of Fourth Amendment Claim; Equitable Tolling\n\n            In his complaint, Schomaker expressly asserts that he was\n\nentitled to the return of his property upon the completion of the\n\ncriminal     proceedings         and    that    defendant   Huftalen      and    the\n\nunidentified property officers violated his Fourth Amendment rights\n\nby \"ma[king] an un[c]onstitutional Property Seizure when they\n\nexercised    dominion      and    control      over   Plaintiff's     property   and\n\nunlawfully detained Plaintiff's property when they refused to take\n\nthe necessary steps, upon the repeated demands of Plaintiff, to\n\neffect     the   release     of    Plaintiff's        property   to    Plaintiff's\n\nAuthorized Agents . . . .\"              Since Schomaker does not contest the\n\nvalidity of the original seizure of his property in 1997, the\n\ndistrict court's determination that the injury upon which this\n\nclaim is based is defendants' failure to release the property upon\n\nSchomaker's \"repeated demands\" is unassailable. The district court\n\ntherefore correctly found that the claim accrued when Schomaker\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fknew or had reason to know that the government's retention of the\n\nproperty became wrongful--i.e., when defendant Huftalen received\n\nand failed to respond to Schomaker's concededly rightful request to\n\nrelease the property, on or about July 13, 1998.            Schomaker does\n\nnot dispute that his claim was subject to New Hampshire's three-\n\nyear general personal injury statute of limitations, see N.H. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. § 508:4; Roman v. Townsend, 224 F.3d 24, 26-27, 29 (1st\n\nCir. 2000); accordingly, since his Fourth Amendment claim was not\n\nfiled until nearly nine years after the date of accrual, it was\n\nproperly deemed untimely.\n\n           To the extent that Schomaker contends that equitable\n\ntolling is warranted because, under the district court's analysis,\n\na constitutional claim based on the failure to return property or\n\nthe destruction of property might accrue and expire before a timely\n\nrequest for the return of property is made, he fails to distinguish\n\nbetween the separate triggering events that would cause each of\n\nthese claims to accrue.         Contrary to Schomaker's suggestion, none\n\nof these claims could accrue without the claimant being aware or\n\nhaving reason to be aware of the triggering event.           Thus, for the\n\nreasons   stated     by   the    district   court,   Schomaker   failed   to\n\ndemonstrate   that    any   exceptional     circumstances   sufficient    to\n\nwarrant equitable tolling were present.              See Vistamar, Inc. v.\n\nFagundo-Fagundo, 430 F.3d 66, 71 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fII. Fifth Amendment - Procedural Due Process\n\n            Schomaker next argues that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to address whether his due process rights were violated\n\nbased solely on lack of notice prior to the destruction of his\n\nproperty.     We agree that Schomaker failed to present evidence\n\nsufficient to support an inference that defendants' retention of\n\nthe   property,    their     failure    to    safeguard    it    or   the   ultimate\n\ndestruction of the property was the result of intentional or\n\nreckless conduct.        The district court correctly determined that\n\nnegligent conduct resulting in an unintended loss of property was\n\ninsufficient      to   support    a   due    process    claim,    see    Daniels   v.\n\nWilliams, 474 U.S. 327, 328 (1986), and, \"where a government\n\nofficial is merely negligent in causing [an] injury, no procedure\n\nfor   compensation      is   constitutionally      required.\"           Davidson   v.\n\nCannon, 474 U.S. 344, 347 (1986).\n\nIII. Immunity Under the Westfall Act\n\n            Although Schomaker purports to challenge the district\n\ncourt's grant of \"qualified immunity\" to defendant Huftalen, since\n\nthe district court did not reach that issue, it appears that\n\nSchomaker's    argument      is   directed     instead    toward      the   district\n\ncourt's determination that Huftalen was entitled to immunity with\n\nregard to the state law tort claims because he was \"acting within\n\nthe scope of his office or employment.\"                28 U.S.C. § 2679(b)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f          Schomaker argues on appeal, as he did in the district\n\ncourt, that defendant Huftalen was not acting within the scope of\n\nhis employment because his conduct--in particular, his failure to\n\nrespond to Schomaker's requests for the return of his property and\n\nhis failure to safeguard or keep adequate records concerning\n\nSchomaker's    property-violated      standards   of    professional\n\nresponsibility, rules of court and state law.     However, Schomaker\n\nfailed to present any evidence that would suggest that any of\n\ndefendant Huftalen's acts and omissions with respect to Schomaker's\n\nproperty rose above the level of negligence, or that he acted with\n\nany motive unrelated to his work.   For the reasons set forth by the\n\ndistrict court, we agree that the record is insufficient to support\n\nan inference that defendant Huftalen acted outside the scope of his\n\nemployment.   The district court therefore properly substituted the\n\nUnited States as the defendant with respect to Schomaker's state\n\nlaw claims.   See 28 U.S.C. § 2679(d)(1).\n\nIV. Sovereign Immunity\n\n          Although the district court did not address the issue,\n\nthe government argued that Schomaker's state law claims were barred\n\nbecause they fell within one of the enumerated exceptions to the\n\nFTCA's limited waiver of sovereign immunity, which exempts from the\n\ncoverage of the statute \"[a]ny claim arising in respect of . . .\n\nthe detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any\n\nofficer of customs or excise or any other law-enforcement officer.\"\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f28   U.S.C.    §   2680(c).   The   Supreme    Court   has   construed   this\n\nexemption expansively to bar \"'any claim arising out of' the\n\ndetention of goods, includ[ing] a claim resulting from negligent\n\nhandling or storage of detained property,\" Kosak v. United States,\n\n465 U.S. 848, 854 (1984), and has held that the phrase \"any other\n\nlaw enforcement officer\" should be construed broadly to apply to\n\nall \"law enforcement officers of whatever kind.\"               Ali v. Fed.\n\nBureau of Prisons, 128 S.Ct. 831, 836, 840-41 (2008).             Schomaker\n\nargued that the exception was inapplicable because the employees of\n\nthe U.S. Attorney's Office who had custody of his property did not\n\nqualify as \"law enforcement officers.\"             We have not yet had\n\noccasion to decide this issue and decline to reach it now because\n\nwe find that Schomaker's tort claims are barred for another reason.\n\nV. Effect of \"No Asset\" Bankruptcy Discharge\n\n              Defendants argued below that Schomaker's March 1998 \"no\n\nasset\" bankruptcy discharge also barred him from asserting any\n\nclaim for damages with respect to the failure to return or the\n\ndestruction of the seized property.           Schomaker filed a Chapter 7\n\nvoluntary bankruptcy petition in October 1997 (while his criminal\n\ncase was pending), in which he claimed personal property, including\n\na computer and a camera, as exempt and also denied that anyone was\n\nholding any property that belonged to him, stating that \"Any\n\nproperty I own has been taken as evidence by the U.S. Marshal as\n\nevidence in a pending court case.             This includes my computer,\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fprinter, monitor, and camera.          It is unlikely that these objects\n\nwill be returned to me.\" Based on those representations, Schomaker\n\nwas granted a \"no asset\" discharge on March 3, 1998, about two\n\nweeks after he was sentenced.\n\n             Defendants maintain that the property for which Schomaker\n\nnow seeks compensation either was or should have been included in\n\nthe bankruptcy estate, and that this action therefore is subject to\n\ndismissal based on judicial estoppel and/or lack of standing.              In\n\nopposition to this argument, Schomaker argued that the seized\n\nproperty was different than (and, apparently, more valuable than)\n\nthe equipment claimed exempt in the bankruptcy proceeding; he\n\nasserts that the computer seized from his house was a \"Packard Bell\n\n486DX2\" and that the computer claimed exempt was a \"V-Tech\" \"Laser\n\n128EX\" that he kept at his parents' house.             He explains that, at\n\nthe time he filed the bankruptcy petition, he mistakenly believed\n\nthat   the   seized   property   was    subject   to   forfeiture,   and   he\n\ntherefore did not believe it qualified as an asset or that he was\n\nrequired to disclose its value; he suggests that, since he stated\n\nin his bankruptcy filings that the computer equipment had been\n\nseized and was not available to him, his disclosure was adequate\n\nand not intentionally misleading, and he should not now be barred\n\nfrom bringing an action to recover for its loss.           This argument is\n\nunavailing.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f           First, Schomaker's failure to distinguish between the\n\n\"computer\" identified in the list of exempt property and that\n\nreferenced in the Interrogatory responses, and his use of the\n\nsingular \"my computer\" in those responses, suggests that the seized\n\ncomputer and the computer claimed exempt were one and the same.                      If\n\nthat were the case, Schomaker would be estopped from seeking to\n\nrecover for the loss of that property in this case because, to the\n\nextent that he now claims over $34,000 in damages resulting from\n\nthat loss, his position seems to be intentionally inconsistent with\n\nhis sworn statements in the bankruptcy proceeding that the property\n\nwas worth less than $1,000.           See Payless Wholesale Distributors,\n\nInc. v. Alberto Culver (P.R.) Inc., 989 F.2d 570, 571 (1st Cir.\n\n1993)   (former       debtor   was   judicially       estopped      from    asserting\n\nmonetary   claims      omitted   from     schedules     supporting         Chapter   11\n\npetition); Oneida Motor Frieght, Inc. v. United Jersey Bank, 848\n\nF.2d 414 (3d Cir. 1988) (\"A long-standing tenet of bankruptcy law\n\nrequires   one    seeking      benefits    under      its   terms    to    satisfy    a\n\ncompanion duty to schedule, for the benefit of creditors, all his\n\ninterests and property rights.\");              Estel v. Bigelow Management,\n\nInc., 323 B.R. 918 (E.D. Tex. 2005) (former chapter 7 debtor was\n\njudicially estopped from maintaining discrimination action because\n\nhe   failed      to     disclose      claims     in     bankruptcy         schedules;\n\nalternatively, because the cause of action was property of his\n\nbankruptcy    estate,      employee     lacked     standing    to    bring     suit);\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fChandler v. Samford Univ., 35 F. Supp.2d 861 (N.D. Ala. 1999)\n\n(involving Chapter 13 case that was converted to a \"no asset\"\n\nChapter 7 one month after debtor filed discrimination suit she had\n\nfailed   to    disclose   to     the   bankruptcy   court;   court   held   that\n\ndebtor's representations that she had \"no assets\" were inconsistent\n\nwith her later assertion of claims against the defendant).\n\n              However,    even    assuming     Schomaker's    explanation    is\n\nsufficient to create an issue of fact as to whether the seized\n\ncomputer referenced in the Interrogatory responses was different\n\nand more valuable than the one claimed as exempt personal property,\n\nand even if he mistakenly believed that the seized property was\n\nsubject to forfeiture and therefore did not constitute an asset,\n\nsince it is undisputed that the property was not in fact the\n\nsubject of a forfeiture proceeding, the property, or any cause of\n\naction to recover it or compensation for its loss would have been\n\nan asset of the bankruptcy estate held by the U.S. Trustee for the\n\nbenefit of the creditors; the fact that Schomaker mistakenly\n\nomitted the property and its value from the assets listed in the\n\npetition does not give him standing to recover for its loss.                 See\n\n11 U.S.C. §§ 323, 521, 541.             See also Estel, 323 B.R. at 924.\n\nThus, whether Schomaker has taken an intentionally inconsistent\n\nposition with regard to the value of the seized property in this\n\naction or failed to disclose its value in the bankruptcy proceeding\n\nbecause he mistakenly believed it was subject to forfeiture, he is\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fnot entitled to seek compensation for its loss.             See Payless\n\nWholesale Distributors, Inc., 989 F.2d at 571; Estel, 323 B.R. 918.\n\n                                CONCLUSION\n\n          In sum, we conclude that Schomaker's Fourth Amendment\n\nBivens claim was properly dismissed as time-barred, his Fifth\n\nAmendment Bivens claim was properly denied because he failed to\n\nestablish that the challenged conduct was sufficient to support a\n\nconstitutional   claim,   the   individual   defendants   were   properly\n\ngranted immunity from the state law tort claims under the Westfall\n\nAct and the United States substituted as the sole defendant, and\n\nthe FTCA claims were properly dismissed either because they were\n\nbarred under 28 U.S.C. § 2680(c), because the individual claims\n\nfailed on the merits, or because Schomaker was estopped from\n\nseeking substantial damages for the loss of property that either\n\nhad de minimis value or was improperly omitted from the list of\n\nassets in his bankruptcy petition.        The judgment of the district\n\ncourt is therefore affirmed. See 1st Cir. Loc. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f",

Accrual of Fourth Amendment Claim; Equitable Tolling\n\n            In his complaint, Schomaker expressly asserts that he was\n\nentitled to the return of his property upon the completion of the\n\ncriminal     proceedings         and    that    defendant   Huftalen      and    the\n\nunidentified property officers violated his Fourth Amendment rights\n\nby \"ma[king] an un[c]onstitutional Property Seizure when they\n\nexercised    dominion      and    control      over   Plaintiff's     property   and\n\nunlawfully detained Plaintiff's property when they refused to take\n\nthe necessary steps, upon the repeated demands of Plaintiff, to\n\neffect     the   release     of    Plaintiff's        property   to    Plaintiff's\n\nAuthorized Agents . . . .\"              Since Schomaker does not contest the\n\nvalidity of the original seizure of his property in 1997, the\n\ndistrict court's determination that the injury upon which this\n\nclaim is based is defendants' failure to release the property upon\n\nSchomaker's \"repeated demands\" is unassailable. The district court\n\ntherefore correctly found that the claim accrued when Schomaker\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fknew or had reason to know that the government's retention of the\n\nproperty became wrongful--i.e., when defendant Huftalen received\n\nand failed to respond to Schomaker's concededly rightful request to\n\nrelease the property, on or about July 13, 1998.            Schomaker does\n\nnot dispute that his claim was subject to New Hampshire's three-\n\nyear general personal injury statute of limitations, see N.H. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. § 508:4; Roman v. Townsend, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199060\"><a href=\"/opinion/199060/roman-v-townsend/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 26-27, 29 (1st\n\nCir. 2000); accordingly, since his Fourth Amendment claim was not\n\nfiled until nearly nine years after the date of accrual, it was\n\nproperly deemed untimely.\n\n           To the extent that Schomaker contends that equitable\n\ntolling is warranted because, under the district court's analysis,\n\na constitutional claim based on the failure to return property or\n\nthe destruction of property might accrue and expire before a timely\n\nrequest for the return of property is made, he fails to distinguish\n\nbetween the separate triggering events that would cause each of\n\nthese claims to accrue.         Contrary to Schomaker's suggestion, none\n\nof these claims could accrue without the claimant being aware or\n\nhaving reason to be aware of the triggering event.           Thus, for the\n\nreasons   stated     by   the    district   court,   Schomaker   failed   to\n\ndemonstrate   that    any   exceptional     circumstances   sufficient    to\n\nwarrant equitable tolling were present.              See Vistamar, Inc. v.\n\nFagundo-Fagundo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201946\"><a href=\"/opinion/201946/vistamar-inc-v-fagundo-fagundo/\"><span class=\"volume\">430</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">66</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 71 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fII. Fifth Amendment - Procedural Due Process\n\n            Schomaker next argues that the district court erred in\n\nfailing to address whether his due process rights were violated\n\nbased solely on lack of notice prior to the destruction of his\n\nproperty.     We agree that Schomaker failed to present evidence\n\nsufficient to support an inference that defendants' retention of\n\nthe   property,    their     failure    to    safeguard    it    or   the   ultimate\n\ndestruction of the property was the result of intentional or\n\nreckless conduct.        The district court correctly determined that\n\nnegligent conduct resulting in an unintended loss of property was\n\ninsufficient      to   support    a   due    process    claim,    see    Daniels   v.\n\nWilliams, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111555\"><a href=\"/opinion/111555/daniels-v-williams/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 328 (1986), and, \"where a government\n\nofficial is merely negligent in causing [an] injury, no procedure\n\nfor   compensation      is   constitutionally      required.\"           Davidson   v.\n\nCannon, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111556\"><a href=\"/opinion/111556/davidson-v-cannon/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">344</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 347 (1986).\n\nIII. Immunity Under the Westfall Act\n\n            Although Schomaker purports to challenge the district\n\ncourt's grant of \"qualified immunity\" to defendant Huftalen, since\n\nthe district court did not reach that issue, it appears that\n\nSchomaker's    argument      is   directed     instead    toward      the   district\n\ncourt's determination that Huftalen was entitled to immunity with\n\nregard to the state law tort claims because he was \"acting within\n\nthe scope of his office or employment.\"                28 U.S.C. § 2679(b)(1).\n\n\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f          Schomaker argues on appeal, as he did in the district\n\ncourt, that defendant Huftalen was not acting within the scope of\n\nhis employment because his conduct--in particular, his failure to\n\nrespond to Schomaker's requests for the return of his property and\n\nhis failure to safeguard or keep adequate records concerning\n\nSchomaker's    property-violated      standards   of    professional\n\nresponsibility, rules of court and state law.     However, Schomaker\n\nfailed to present any evidence that would suggest that any of\n\ndefendant Huftalen's acts and omissions with respect to Schomaker's\n\nproperty rose above the level of negligence, or that he acted with\n\nany motive unrelated to his work.   For the reasons set forth by the\n\ndistrict court, we agree that the record is insufficient to support\n\nan inference that defendant Huftalen acted outside the scope of his\n\nemployment.   The district court therefore properly substituted the\n\nUnited States as the defendant with respect to Schomaker's state\n\nlaw claims.   See 28 U.S.C. § 2679(d)(1).\n\nIV. Sovereign Immunity\n\n          Although the district court did not address the issue,\n\nthe government argued that Schomaker's state law claims were barred\n\nbecause they fell within one of the enumerated exceptions to the\n\nFTCA's limited waiver of sovereign immunity, which exempts from the\n\ncoverage of the statute \"[a]ny claim arising in respect of . . .\n\nthe detention of any goods, merchandise, or other property by any\n\nofficer of customs or excise or any other law-enforcement officer.\"\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f28   U.S.C.    §   2680(c).   The   Supreme    Court   has   construed   this\n\nexemption expansively to bar \"'any claim arising out of' the\n\ndetention of goods, includ[ing] a claim resulting from negligent\n\nhandling or storage of detained property,\" Kosak v. United States,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111121\"><a href=\"/opinion/111121/kosak-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">848</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 854 (1984), and has held that the phrase \"any other\n\nlaw enforcement officer\" should be construed broadly to apply to\n\nall \"law enforcement officers of whatever kind.\"               Ali v. Fed.\n\nBureau of Prisons, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145834\"><a href=\"/opinion/145834/ali-v-federal-bureau-of-prisons/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">831</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 836, 840-41 (2008).             Schomaker\n\nargued that the exception was inapplicable because the employees of\n\nthe U.S. Attorney's Office who had custody of his property did not\n\nqualify as \"law enforcement officers.\"             We have not yet had\n\noccasion to decide this issue and decline to reach it now because\n\nwe find that Schomaker's tort claims are barred for another reason.\n\nV. Effect of \"No Asset\" Bankruptcy Discharge\n\n              Defendants argued below that Schomaker's March 1998 \"no\n\nasset\" bankruptcy discharge also barred him from asserting any\n\nclaim for damages with respect to the failure to return or the\n\ndestruction of the seized property.           Schomaker filed a Chapter 7\n\nvoluntary bankruptcy petition in October 1997 (while his criminal\n\ncase was pending), in which he claimed personal property, including\n\na computer and a camera, as exempt and also denied that anyone was\n\nholding any property that belonged to him, stating that \"Any\n\nproperty I own has been taken as evidence by the U.S. Marshal as\n\nevidence in a pending court case.             This includes my computer,\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fprinter, monitor, and camera.          It is unlikely that these objects\n\nwill be returned to me.\" Based on those representations, Schomaker\n\nwas granted a \"no asset\" discharge on March 3, 1998, about two\n\nweeks after he was sentenced.\n\n             Defendants maintain that the property for which Schomaker\n\nnow seeks compensation either was or should have been included in\n\nthe bankruptcy estate, and that this action therefore is subject to\n\ndismissal based on judicial estoppel and/or lack of standing.              In\n\nopposition to this argument, Schomaker argued that the seized\n\nproperty was different than (and, apparently, more valuable than)\n\nthe equipment claimed exempt in the bankruptcy proceeding; he\n\nasserts that the computer seized from his house was a \"Packard Bell\n\n486DX2\" and that the computer claimed exempt was a \"V-Tech\" \"Laser\n\n128EX\" that he kept at his parents' house.             He explains that, at\n\nthe time he filed the bankruptcy petition, he mistakenly believed\n\nthat   the   seized   property   was    subject   to   forfeiture,   and   he\n\ntherefore did not believe it qualified as an asset or that he was\n\nrequired to disclose its value; he suggests that, since he stated\n\nin his bankruptcy filings that the computer equipment had been\n\nseized and was not available to him, his disclosure was adequate\n\nand not intentionally misleading, and he should not now be barred\n\nfrom bringing an action to recover for its loss.           This argument is\n\nunavailing.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f           First, Schomaker's failure to distinguish between the\n\n\"computer\" identified in the list of exempt property and that\n\nreferenced in the Interrogatory responses, and his use of the\n\nsingular \"my computer\" in those responses, suggests that the seized\n\ncomputer and the computer claimed exempt were one and the same.                      If\n\nthat were the case, Schomaker would be estopped from seeking to\n\nrecover for the loss of that property in this case because, to the\n\nextent that he now claims over $34,000 in damages resulting from\n\nthat loss, his position seems to be intentionally inconsistent with\n\nhis sworn statements in the bankruptcy proceeding that the property\n\nwas worth less than $1,000.
