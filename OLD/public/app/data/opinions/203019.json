Keselica   appeals   from   the\n\ndistrict court's sua sponte dismissal, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1915(e)(2)(B)(ii), of a civil rights complaint filed approximately\n\none month after the sua sponte dismissal of a substantially similar\n\ncomplaint that Keselica had filed in the same court.                In both\n\ninstances, the district court concluded that Keselica's claims\n\nnecessarily called into question the legality of his confinement\n\nand, therefore, were not cognizable under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 or\n\n1985.       We summarily affirmed the first dismissal, see Keselica v.\n\nCarcieri, No. 07-1195 (1st Cir. Sept. 4, 2007) (per curiam), and\n\nthe same disposition is appropriate here.\n\n               Dismissal of the complaint was proper for the reasons set\n\nforth in the magistrate judge's January 30, 2007, report and\n\nrecommendation, subsequently adopted by the district court.1              See\n\nWilkinson v.
