Right.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 6, 1954, Desjardins turned his book in to Vanier and told him that he was going to work non-union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial examiner found, and the Board adopted his finding, that Ablondi did in fact refuse to employ Desjardins until he had secured union clearance, and that the Union was responsible for Ablondi's illegal conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the legality or illegality of the contract itself, the respondent contends that the Board's finding that Local #517 executed, maintained, and enforced an unlawful Union security agreement with the Gil Wyner Construction Company &#8212; as constituted by Article VII, Sections 3, 3a and 3b &#8212; is erroneous because unsupported by substantial competent evidence on the record as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board based the above finding in part upon the testimony given by Joseph Vanier, the Business Agent of Local #517:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Q. (By Mr. Kowal) Was Gil Wyner in 1953 and 1954 a union contractor? A. Right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Q. And what was a union contractor? A. A union contractor is a contractor that agrees to employ union men if the same can be had.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent Union seeks to avoid the effect of this testimony by asserting that it represents only Vanier's conclusion as to the existence of a separate informal agreement between Gil Wyner and Local #517 and argues that: \"None of the subsidiary facts are set forth on the basis of which Vanier offers his indirect conclusion that a separate oral agreement has been reached.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is not persuasive. Vanier was precisely the man who would be charged by the Union with the practical administration of any unlawful hiring practices to which the Company and the Union might have agreed. Without regard to whether or not Vanier was correct in his conclusion that the Company had agreed \"* * * to employ union men if the same can be had,\" it seems to us clear that if Vanier thought that such an agreement had been made, and if the Company and the Union permitted him to conduct himself accordingly, then for all intents and purposes an illegally discriminatory hiring practice was thereby put into effect even if there had been no such prior agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondent also contends that the weight given to Vanier's testimony to the effect that the Company was a union contractor is \"* * * insignificant in view of the record as a whole.\" It is a sufficient answer to this contention that the trial examiner and the Board could properly give credence to the testimony of Vanier in so far as it tended to establish the existence of the discriminatory practices, and at the same time disbelieve those portions of his testimony which carried a contrary import. We conclude that substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole supports the Board's finding that the respondent Union executed, maintained, and enforced an unlawful union-security agreement with the Company in violation of Section 8(b) (1) (A) and (2) of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Desjardins' unsuccessful application for employment in April, 1954, the Board found, and there was substantial evidence to support the finding, that Ablondi did in fact discriminate unlawfully against Desjardins' application because Desjardins had not obtained Union clearance. The respondent attempts to exculpate itself from liability for the conduct of Ablondi by asserting, first, that Ablondi was not acting as its agent; and, secondly, that the respondent had not \"caused\" Ablondi's conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without pausing to consider the agency question, we believe that Ablondi, in discriminating against Desjardins, was acting pursuant to the illegal hiring practices for which the Union had contracted, and therefore that the Union \"caused\" the Company to discriminate unlawfully against Desjardins, thereby violating Section 8(b) (1) (A) and (2) of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Completely apart from the discriminatory acts of Ablondi, it seems to us clear that the Union itself directly violated Section 8(b) (1) (A) and (2) of the Act when it refused to give Desjardins the clearance which the Company required pursuant to the discriminatory hiring practices for which the Union had contracted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although substantial additional evidence could be adduced in support of the conclusions of the Board we regard the above recited reasons as sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

Right.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 6, 1954, Desjardins turned his book in to Vanier and told him that he was going to work non-union.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The trial examiner found, and the Board adopted his finding, that Ablondi did in fact refuse to employ Desjardins until he had secured union clearance, and that the Union was responsible for Ablondi's illegal conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to the legality or illegality of the contract itself, the respondent contends that the Board's finding that Local #517 executed, maintained, and enforced an unlawful Union security agreement with the Gil Wyner Construction Company &#8212; as constituted by Article VII, Sections 3, 3a and 3b &#8212; is erroneous because unsupported by substantial competent evidence on the record as a whole.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Board based the above finding in part upon the testimony given by Joseph Vanier, the Business Agent of Local #517:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Q. (By Mr. Kowal) Was Gil Wyner in 1953 and 1954 a union contractor? A. Right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Q. And what was a union contractor? A. A union contractor is a contractor that agrees to employ union men if the same can be had.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The respondent Union seeks to avoid the effect of this testimony by asserting that it represents only Vanier's conclusion as to the existence of a separate informal agreement between Gil Wyner and Local #517 and argues that: \"None of the subsidiary facts are set forth on the basis of which Vanier offers his indirect conclusion that a separate oral agreement has been reached.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is not persuasive. Vanier was precisely the man who would be charged by the Union with the practical administration of any unlawful hiring practices to which the Company and the Union might have agreed. Without regard to whether or not Vanier was correct in his conclusion that the Company had agreed \"* * * to employ union men if the same can be had,\" it seems to us clear that if Vanier thought that such an agreement had been made, and if the Company and the Union permitted him to conduct himself accordingly, then for all intents and purposes an illegally discriminatory hiring practice was thereby put into effect even if there had been no such prior agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Respondent also contends that the weight given to Vanier's testimony to the effect that the Company was a union contractor is \"* * * insignificant in view of the record as a whole.\" It is a sufficient answer to this contention that the trial examiner and the Board could properly give credence to the testimony of Vanier in so far as it tended to establish the existence of the discriminatory practices, and at the same time disbelieve those portions of his testimony which carried a contrary import. We conclude that substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole supports the Board's finding that the respondent Union executed, maintained, and enforced an unlawful union-security agreement with the Company in violation of Section 8(b) (1) (A) and (2) of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Desjardins' unsuccessful application for employment in April, 1954, the Board found, and there was substantial evidence to support the finding, that Ablondi did in fact discriminate unlawfully against Desjardins' application because Desjardins had not obtained Union clearance. The respondent attempts to exculpate itself from liability for the conduct of Ablondi by asserting, first, that Ablondi was not acting as its agent; and, secondly, that the respondent had not \"caused\" Ablondi's conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Without pausing to consider the agency question, we believe that Ablondi, in discriminating against Desjardins, was acting pursuant to the illegal hiring practices for which the Union had contracted, and therefore that the Union \"caused\" the Company to discriminate unlawfully against Desjardins, thereby violating Section 8(b) (1) (A) and (2) of the Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Completely apart from the discriminatory acts of Ablondi, it seems to us clear that the Union itself directly violated Section 8(b) (1) (A) and (2) of the Act when it refused to give Desjardins the clearance which the Company required pursuant to the discriminatory hiring practices for which the Union had contracted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although substantial additional evidence could be adduced in support of the conclusions of the Board we regard the above recited reasons as sufficient.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A decree will be entered enforcing the order of the Board.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",
