Petitioners and brothers Rorne\n\nDias Gomes and Anderson Dias Gomes are natives and citizens of\n\nBrazil who, on the ground that they fear for their safety in their\n\nhome country, applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nrelief under the Convention Against Torture.          An Immigration Judge\n\n(\"IJ\") denied their applications, and the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (\"BIA\") denied their appeals with a separate written\n\nopinion.\n\n           The Gomes brothers now petition for judicial review of\n\nthe BIA's decision pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1252.               They do not,\n\nhowever, challenge the BIA's determinations that their asylum\n\nclaims were untimely, and therefore those claims are waived.\n\nNikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 120 n.3 (1st Cir. 2005); see\n\nalso Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp., 904 F.2d 83, 87 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\nSimilarly, the IJ's denial of the petitioners’ claims under the\n\nConvention Against Torture were neither appealed to the BIA nor\n\nincluded in the petitions for review, and consequently those too\n\nare waived.     Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d at 120 n.3; Makhoul v. Ashcroft,\n\n387 F.3d 75, 80 (1st Cir. 2004); Sandstrom, 904 F.2d at 87.                The\n\nsole   matter   before   us   is   therefore   the   BIA's   denial   of   the\n\npetitioners’ applications for withholding of removal.\n\n           The gravamen of each application is the alleged threat of\n\nviolence from members of a Brazilian gang who suspect that one of\n\nthe Gomes brothers identified the gang's leader to the police as\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fthe person who murdered the petitioners’ nephew.                        The gang's\n\nleader, whom the petitioners believe is ultimately responsible for\n\nthe threats, was convicted of the murder and incarcerated in\n\nBrazil.      According to the petitioners, the gang members suspect\n\nthat one of the brothers is the police informant, and because the\n\ngang members do not know with certainty which of the brothers did\n\nit, they have threatened harm to both.\n\n             To qualify for protection under the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act, a person seeking withholding of removal must show\n\nthat he cannot return to his home country \"because of persecution\n\nor a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\"     8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); see Castillo-Diaz v. Holder,\n\n562   F.3d   23,   27    (1st    Cir.   2009)    (citing    Palma-Mazariegos    v.\n\nGonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir. 2005)).                  \"A petitioner must\n\nalso show that the persecution is the direct result of 'government\n\naction, government-supported action, or government's unwillingness\n\nor inability to control private conduct.'\" Ly v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d\n\n126, 132 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Kho v. Keisler, 505 F.3d 50, 55\n\n(1st Cir. 2008)).        The petitioner bears the burden of proving his\n\nclaim.    Pulisir v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 302, 308 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n             The IJ and BIA both found that the record evidence failed\n\nto    demonstrate       the     requisite      connection    of   the    purported\n\npersecution to the Brazilian government's action or inaction.                  The\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\frecord evidence supports these findings. The record shows that the\n\nBrazilian government incarcerated the gang's leader for a previous\n\nact of violence -- the murder of the petitioners’ nephew -- thus\n\ndemonstrating its willingness and ability to combat the gang's\n\nviolent tendencies.     Moreover, the petitioners concede that they\n\nhave not informed the Brazilian police of the gang's threats, and\n\nthis fact also severs the threats from any action or inaction of\n\nthe government of Brazil.        See, e.g., Castillo-Diaz, 562 F.3d at\n\n27-28.     The   lack   of   government      involvement    precludes   the\n\npetitioners’ eligibility for withholding of removal.\n\n           Although we need go no further to affirm the decisions of\n\nthe BIA, we note that the petitions contain other weaknesses, among\n\nthem the fact that the petitioners' older brother, who also lived\n\nin Brazil at the relevant time, was not subject to the same\n\nthreats.   This fact undermines the credibility of the alleged\n\nthreat awaiting the petitioners in Brazil, see, e.g., Nikijuluw,\n\n427 F.3d at 122, and it suggests that the petitioners’ asserted\n\n\"particular   social    group\"    --    whether   defined   as   \"siblings,\"\n\n\"brothers,\" or \"family\" -- is not \"one central reason\" for the\n\nthreats against them, see 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(I); Singh v.\n\nMukasey, 543 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n           PETITIONS DENIED.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f",
