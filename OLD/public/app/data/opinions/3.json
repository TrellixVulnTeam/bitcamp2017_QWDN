David DePuy with whom Scott H. Harris, Adam M. Hamel, and\nMcLane, Graf, Raulerson & Middleton, Professional Association were\non brief for appellant.\n     David G. Klaber with whom Mark D. Feczko, Jared S. Hawk,\nJeffrey S. King, Gregory R. Youman, and K&L Gates LLP were on brief\nfor appellee.\n\n\n\n                           February 12, 2010\n\f            Per Curiam.       The issue before us is whether the district\n\ncourt     abused       its   discretion     by     denying     plaintiff    Ginette\n\nMorrissette's post-trial motions for a new trial and for default\n\njudgment    as     a    sanction   for    an     alleged   discovery     violation.\n\nPlaintiff was granted a continuance to conduct further discovery\n\nwhen the disputed evidence emerged and expressly elected to proceed\n\nwith trial after doing so.           We find no abuse of discretion and\n\naffirm.\n\n            The underlying case involves a federal products liability\n\naction arising out of a forklift accident that occurred on June 9,\n\n1999.     The forklift manufacturer is the defendant.                The forklift\n\ndriver died on June 17, 2006, while this litigation was pending;\n\nthe administrator of his estate proceeded to trial in the federal\n\ndistrict court of Massachusetts.               Trial began on January 15, 2008.\n\nOn the fourth day of a fifteen-day jury trial, plaintiff learned\n\nthat test results from a different model forklift had been used to\n\nderive capacity information about the forklift involved in the\n\naccident.        Defendant     had   previously       denied    having     any   test\n\ninformation relevant to the forklift model that the decedent had\n\nbeen driving.\n\n            After hearing from both sides on the issue, the district\n\ncourt denied plaintiff's motion for sanctions and opted to suspend\n\ntrial for three days to allow the parties \"to get to the bottom of\n\nthis testing and talk to whomever [they] need[ed] to talk to.\"\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\fDuring this period, plaintiff conducted three depositions and\n\nobtained seventy-nine pages of documents related to the forklift\n\ntest results.      At a conference on January 31, 2008, the court asked\n\nplaintiff's counsel how he intended to proceed.                Plaintiff's\n\ncounsel repeatedly indicated his readiness to move forward with the\n\ntrial.    Plaintiff did not ask for a further continuance or move for\n\na new trial and went forward with the trial.                Plaintiff then\n\nadmitted the test results into evidence, had her liability expert\n\ntestify    about    them,   used   them    in   her   cross-examination   of\n\ndefendant's liability expert, and referred to them repeatedly at\n\nclosing.\n\n            On February 12, 2008, the jury returned a unanimous\n\nverdict for the defendant.         Plaintiff moved for a grant of new\n\ntrial under Rules 59 and 60(b) and for entry of default judgment\n\nagainst the defendant as a sanction for its alleged discovery\n\nviolation.     The trial judge died before acting on this motion.\n\nAnother judge denied the motion on March 24, 2009, and denied\n\nplaintiff's motion for reconsideration on May 13, 2009.1\n\n            On appeal, plaintiff urges that the district court erred\n\nby refusing to set aside the jury's verdict.           We review for abuse\n\nof discretion the denial of the new trial, Jennings v. Jones, 587\n\n\n     1\n          Defendant's assertion that we lack jurisdiction over the\nMarch 24 order because plaintiff failed to file a notice of appeal\nwithin thirty days of that order is flatly contradicted by our\ncaselaw. See Marie v. Allied Home Mortgage Corp., 402 F.3d 1, 7\n(1st Cir. 2005).\n\n                                     -3-\n\fF.3d 430, 436-37 (1st Cir. 2009), and the denial of sanctions, see\n\nFerrara & DiMercurio v. St. Paul Mercury Ins. Co., 240 F.3d 1, 12-\n\n13 (1st Cir. 2001).   Plaintiff asks that we order as a remedy the\n\nentry of judgment in her favor and does not seek a new trial.\n\nThere was no error, however, to remedy.\n\n          Plaintiff made the strategic choice to proceed with trial\n\nafter the disputed evidence emerged. We have repeatedly held \"that\n\nthe appropriate course for parties who uncover discovery violations\n\nis 'not to seek reversal after an unfavorable verdict,' but to\n\nrequest a continuance 'at the time the surprise occurs.'\"   Tiller\n\nv. Baghdady, 294 F.3d 277, 281 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting U.S. Fid.\n\n& Guar. Co. v. Baker Material Handling Corp., 62 F.3d 24, 29 (1st\n\nCir. 1995)).   Plaintiff was granted a three-day continuance and\n\nused this time to conduct extensive discovery.   Plaintiff did not\n\nrequest an additional continuance or seek a mistrial at that point,\n\nand she must live with that choice.\n\n          The district court did not abuse its discretion when it\n\ndenied plaintiff's post-trial motions.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f",
