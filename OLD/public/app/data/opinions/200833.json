Defendant   Terrence    Glaum\n\nappeals from his conviction and sentence for participating in a\n\nmarijuana distribution conspiracy.           He raises several claims of\n\nerror.   We affirm.\n\n                               I.    Background\n\n          We state the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\njury’s verdict.     See United States v. Diaz, 300 F.3d 66, 69 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).\n\n          A.        Glaum Joins the Conspiracy\n\n           The conspiracy underlying this prosecution operated to\n\ndistribute Mexican-grown marijuana throughout the United States.\n\nThe head of the conspiracy was a man known only as “Jefe.”                  He\n\nraised large crops of marijuana for shipment across the border. An\n\nindividual known as the “Old Man” or “Dad” worked under Jefe as his\n\nchief distributor.       The    Old    Man   received   large   shipments   of\n\nmarijuana from Jefe to distribute to other dealers, including\n\nAnthony Salsberry, who operated out of San Diego.               Salsberry, in\n\nturn, would distribute the marijuana to other smaller dealers, who\n\nwould sell the drugs to users. Among Salsberry’s customers were an\n\nindividual in New York, Ralph Martino, and two individuals in\n\nMaine, Ronnie Kerrigan and Paul Sekenski.\n\n           As part of his operation, Salsberry employed Glaum’s ex-\n\nwife, Sheila Case, to assist him in shipping the marijuana.            In the\n\nmiddle of 2000, Case asked Salsberry if he could put Glaum “to\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fwork.”   Salsberry agreed and provided Glaum with approximately\n\nfifty pounds of marijuana to sell in Arizona.     In addition to his\n\nwork distributing marijuana, Glaum assisted Salsberry in packaging\n\nthe drugs.     Working out of his garage, Glaum weighed, “shrink\n\nwrapp[ed]” and “vacuum seal[ed]” marijuana to prepare it for\n\nshipment.    As compensation, Salsberry paid Glaum “a percentage” of\n\nthe profits.\n\n            At approximately the same time that Glaum started working\n\nfor Salsberry, the Old Man offered Salsberry a two-ton load of\n\nmarijuana to distribute.    After a portion of the load was smuggled\n\nacross the border, Salsberry obtained a sample to send to Martino\n\nto gauge his interest in purchasing the load.\n\n            In mid-October 2000, after receiving word from Martino\n\nthat he was interested, Salsberry met with Jefe and the Old Man in\n\nSan Diego to discuss the Martino deal.     At this meeting, Jefe and\n\nthe Old Man told Salsberry that only one ton would be available\n\nimmediately and that the other ton would be placed “on hold”.1\n\nSalsberry concluded the meeting by telling his superiors that he\n\nwould organize the transportation of the load to Martino.\n\n            Salsberry knew that Martino could arrange to transport\n\nthe shipment himself, but Salsberry preferred to find an alternate\n\nmethod so that he could charge Martino a higher fee.            In a\n\n\n\n     1\n       Martino later rejected the second ton because of its poor\nquality.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fsubsequent conversation with Glaum, Salsberry learned that Glaum\n\nhad access to several trucks which could be used to ship the\n\nmarijuana to New York.\n\n            Soon after this conversation, Salsberry attended another\n\nmeeting with Jefe and the Old Man.            This time Glaum also attended,\n\nand Salsberry introduced him to the heads of the organization.              At\n\nthis meeting, Salsberry assured the Old Man and Jefe that Glaum was\n\ncapable of organizing the transportation for the Martino deal but\n\nthat   he   could   not   begin   the    transport   for   two   weeks.    The\n\nparticipants therefore agreed that for two weeks the deal would\n\nremain “on hold.”\n\n            B.      Salsberry’s Arrest and Cooperation\n\n            On November 14, 2000, during the two-week hiatus in the\n\nMartino deal, Salsberry was arrested after one of his drivers\n\nturned him in to authorities.            After his arrest, Salsberry was\n\nincarcerated in San Diego.        From jail, Salsberry called Glaum to\n\ncheck on the Martino deal and to inform him of his status.                While\n\nSalsberry was incarcerated, he spoke to Glaum nearly every day.\n\nDuring these calls, Glaum assured Salsberry that “he wouldn’t let\n\n[him] down” and that he “wanted to keep things going.”                The two\n\neventually agreed that Glaum would carry on Salsberry’s business\n\nwhile Salsberry was in jail.\n\n            On November 18, 2000, Glaum sent his attorney, Phil\n\nGagnon, to meet with Salsberry in jail.                Gagnon served as an\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fintermediary between Glaum and Salsberry, meeting with Salsberry on\n\nseveral occasions.       At one of their meetings, Salsberry provided\n\nGagnon with Ronnie Kerrigan’s and the Old Man’s telephone numbers.\n\n            On January 17, 2001, Salsberry decided to cooperate with\n\nthe government.      Soon afterwards, Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\")\n\nAgent Paul Wolf traveled from Maine to California to debrief\n\nSalsberry.    As part of his cooperation agreement, Salsberry agreed\n\nto remain in contact with Glaum and Gagnon and to provide Glaum\n\nwith Wolf’s pager number.           Eventually, Salsberry gave Glaum the\n\npager number, pretending that it belonged to Paul Sekenski.\n\n             C.      The Sting Operation\n\n             Wolf returned to Maine from meeting with Salsberry on\n\nJanuary 19, 2001.        Two days later, he received an electronic page\n\nfrom Glaum.       In their introductory call, Glaum identified himself\n\nas a friend of Salsberry and asked Wolf if he wanted “to discuss\n\ndoing some business.”          Glaum said that he soon would be traveling\n\nto Maine to bring drugs to Ronnie Kerrigan and that he would be\n\nable to deliver drugs to Wolf at that time.            Wolf told him that he\n\nwould have to “check [him] out” before placing an order.                  Glaum\n\ninvited Wolf to call him when he was ready to deal.\n\n             On January 24, 2001, Wolf called Glaum.             After Glaum\n\nexplained    how    he   had    become   associated   with   Salsberry,   Wolf\n\nbroached the subject of the Martino deal.             Wolf asked Glaum if he\n\nknew Martino.      Glaum stated that he knew “of him” but that he knew\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f“Dad real well.”    At the conclusion of the conversation, Glaum\n\noffered to send Wolf a small shipment of marijuana.\n\n           On January 30, 2001, Wolf and Glaum negotiated the\n\nsmaller shipment that they had initially discussed on January 24th.\n\nGlaum agreed to send Wolf a ten-pound load.   Wolf, in turn,   rented\n\na \"mail drop\" box to receive the shipment at a Mail Boxes Etc. in\n\nSaco, Maine.   On February 10, 2001, Wolf provided the address to\n\nGlaum, and Glaum told him to expect the drugs to arrive in a\n\npackage appearing to contain candles.\n\n           On February 13, 2001, Glaum and Wolf again discussed the\n\nten-pound shipment. This time they discussed payment. Wolf agreed\n\nto send half of the money immediately and to pay the rest when they\n\nmet.    In their next conversation, on February 18, 2001, they\n\ndiscussed the possibility of a larger shipment.    Glaum offered to\n\nsend a sample of the larger shipment or to bring it to Maine when\n\nhe visited Kerrigan.   He told Wolf that he had just obtained “three\n\nhun[dred]” pounds of marijuana and that the drugs were “Dad’s\n\nthing” and were “all Dad.”\n\n           Wolf received the ten-pound shipment on February 20,\n\n2001.   Wolf called that day to inform Glaum that the shipment had\n\narrived.   The next conversation between Wolf and Glaum took place\n\non February 22, 2001, during which Wolf told Glaum that Martino was\n\n“kinda anxious” about the larger deal.\n\n\n\n\n                                -6-\n\f          At this point, Wolf arranged for DEA Agent Ralph Caruso\n\nto pose as Martino, in order to expand the investigation.                On\n\nFebruary 25, 2001, Wolf told Glaum that he had shared some of the\n\nten-pound shipment with Martino and that, as a result, Martino\n\nwanted to meet to finalize the deal.      Wolf asked Glaum if he could\n\ngive Martino his telephone number.       Glaum agreed.\n\n          The investigation then shifted to San Diego.        Caruso and\n\nDEA Agent Judy Gustafson, who was posing as Martino’s girlfriend,\n\nmet with Glaum on February 29, 2001.     Glaum told Caruso that he had\n\narranged to transport the drugs.    At their next meeting on March 1,\n\n2001, Glaum insisted that Caruso provide immediate payment for the\n\none-ton shipment.2   The DEA was unwilling to provide such a large\n\npayment to Glaum and accordingly shifted its focus to Gagnon, in\n\nthe hope that it could arrange the Martino deal through him.        After\n\nnumerous attempts over several months, the agency abandoned this\n\neffort because   Gagnon   refused   to   take   a   “proactive”   role   in\n\norganizing the deal.\n\n          Because Caruso was unable to make progress through either\n\nGlaum or Gagnon, the DEA decided that Wolf should reinitiate\n\ncontact with Glaum, and on July 16, 2001, Wolf placed a call to\n\nGlaum.   During this call, Wolf asked Glaum about obtaining new\n\n\n\n     2\n       During this meeting, Glaum admitted that he had been\nsmuggling marijuana from Mexico since he was eighteen years old and\nthat he had sent “300 or 400 hundred in the mail without any\nproblems.”\n\n                                -7-\n\fshipments of marijuana. Glaum stated that he had quality marijuana\n\navailable but that he was upset that he had not been paid for\n\nearlier shipments to Maine.     He also said that he had a new person\n\nworking in Bangor, Maine to oversee some of his affairs.\n\n           Wolf and Glaum proceeded to discuss the logistics for\n\nsending smaller shipments.          Glaum suggested sending forty-pound\n\nlots on the same day to two different addresses.            He said that he\n\nhad been shipping between 400 and 500 pounds of marijuana every two\n\nweeks and that, in some weeks, he had sent 600 pounds.            Glaum also\n\nexplained that he had formed a shipping company called “Simply\n\nShipping” through which he trafficked drugs.            Glaum noted that his\n\nassociate in Bangor, Eugene Monroe, had “probably about a hundred\n\npounds of marijuana” on hand, and suggested that Wolf meet with him\n\nto set up a deal.\n\n           D.        “Dealing” with Monroe\n\n           The day after Wolf’s conversation with Glaum, he received\n\nan electronic page from Monroe.        Monroe explained to Wolf that he\n\nwas working with Glaum and that, going forward, Glaum wanted Monroe\n\nand Wolf to handle “the account” themselves.\n\n           On July 24, 2001, Monroe met Wolf at a restaurant in\n\nWaterville, Maine.       Monroe said that Glaum had taken over the\n\nbusiness after Salsberry was incarcerated. He also explained that,\n\nbecause of difficulties that Glaum had encountered working with\n\nRonnie   Kerrigan,    Glaum   had    hired   him   to   oversee   the   Maine\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\foperations.        Monroe described the method for shipping the drugs.\n\nThe drugs would arrive from Simply Shipping in boxes with religious\n\nlogos so as to dampen suspicions about their contents.                           Wolf\n\nprovided       Monroe   with   an    address   at    a   Mail     Boxes   Etc.    in\n\nScarborough, Maine, where Glaum could send the drugs.                       Monroe\n\nshowed Wolf a sample of the available marijuana.                After seeing the\n\nsample, Wolf placed an order for 100 pounds.                    Monroe responded\n\nthat, prior to delivering such a large amount, he would have to\n\ncheck on availability with Glaum.\n\n               Later that day, Monroe contacted Wolf and told him that,\n\neven though Glaum had 120 pounds of marijuana in his possession,\n\nonly forty pounds were available to him.             Monroe said that he would\n\nbring twenty five pounds to the same restaurant where they earlier\n\nhad met and that Glaum would ship the rest.\n\n               On the afternoon of July 25, 2001, Monroe and Wolf met in\n\nthe restaurant parking lot.              Monroe placed the drugs in the\n\nbackseat of Wolf’s car.3            The next morning, Wolf received a call\n\nfrom the Mail Boxes Etc. informing him that he had received two\n\nboxes from “Faith Unity World Service” sent by Simply Shipping.\n\nBoth       boxes   contained   vacuum    sealed     bricks   of    marijuana.\n\n               After receiving the shipment, Wolf called Monroe to tell\n\nhim that it had arrived.              Monroe stated that Glaum had just\n\nreceived another 400 pounds of marijuana to distribute.                   On July\n\n\n       3\n            Monroe delivered only twenty pounds of marijuana.\n\n                                        -9-\n\f30, 2001, Monroe and Wolf made plans for Wolf to receive an\n\nadditional twenty five pounds of drugs.              The two agreed to meet in\n\nBrunswick, Maine, the following day.              Monroe was arrested just as\n\nWolf arrived at the meeting spot.              At approximately the same time,\n\nGlaum was arrested in San Diego.\n\n           E. Trial and Sentence\n\n           Glaum was charged in a single-count indictment with\n\nconspiracy      to   distribute   and     to    possess   with   the    intent   to\n\ndistribute 1,000 or more kilograms of marijuana, see 21 U.S.C. §§\n\n846 and 841(a)(1).           After a five-day trial, the jury convicted\n\nGlaum but specifically found that he was responsible for only\n\nbetween   100    and   999    kilograms    of    marijuana.      At    sentencing,\n\nhowever, the district court determined that Glaum was responsible\n\nfor 1,052 kilograms of marijuana. The court sentenced Glaum to 121\n\nmonths of imprisonment and four years of supervised release. Glaum\n\ntimely appealed from the conviction and sentence.\n\n                                 II. Discussion\n\n           Glaum raises six main issues on appeal. First, he claims\n\nthat the government failed to prove his participation in the single\n\nconspiracy alleged in the indictment.               Second, he claims that he\n\nwas   entrapped.        Third,    he    claims     that   the    district   court\n\nincorrectly instructed the jury on his entrapment defense. Fourth,\n\nhe claims that the district court erred in its drug quantity\n\ncalculations. Fifth, he claims that a portion of the drug quantity\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fattributed to him should have been excluded because of sentencing\n\nmanipulation.   Sixth, he claims that the district court erred by\n\ndeclining to grant him credit for acceptance of responsibility. We\n\naddress these claims seriatim.\n\n          A.     Single Conspiracy\n\n          Glaum argues that the government failed to prove that he\n\nwas involved in the single conspiracy described in the indictment.\n\nThe indictment alleged that, from the fall of 2000 until his\n\narrest, on July 31, 2001, Glaum participated in a single conspiracy\n\nwith Salsberry and others to distribute marijuana.     Glaum asserts\n\nthat the evidence established two separate conspiracies. The first\n\ninvolved Salsberry and concluded when Salsberry agreed to become a\n\ngovernment agent; the second involved Monroe and concluded when\n\nGlaum was arrested.\n\n           Whether a given body of evidence proves one conspiracy\n\nor multiple conspiracies is an issue of fact.   See United States v.\n\nPortela, 167 F.3d 687, 696 (1st Cir. 1999).      Thus, on appeal, we\n\nreview the jury’s single-conspiracy determination by asking whether\n\nthe finding was rational given the evidence.          Id.   We have\n\nidentified a non-exclusive list of factors to guide this inquiry:\n\n(1) was there evidence of a common purpose? (2) were the various\n\nelements of the plan interdependent? and (3) was there some degree\n\nof overlap among the participants?      See United States v. Rivera-\n\nRuiz, 244 F.3d 263, 268 (1st Cir. 2001); Portela, 167 F.3d at 695.\n\n\n                                 -11-\n\f            Here, there was sufficient evidence to find Glaum guilty\n\nof participating in the charged single conspiracy. There was\n\nevidence that, in the fall of 2000, Glaum conspired with Salsberry\n\nto sell drugs.    See Portela, 167 F.3d at 695 (goal of selling drugs\n\nfor profit satisfies common goal requirement).             After agreeing to\n\njoin with Salsberry, Glaum performed several acts to further the\n\ngoals of the conspiracy, including weighing and preparing drugs for\n\nshipment    and   sale    and   meeting    with    Salsberry’s     suppliers.\n\nFollowing Salsberry’s arrest, Glaum agreed to assume Salsberry’s\n\nrole in the business and proceeded to honor this agreement, unaware\n\nthat Salsberry had agreed to become a government agent.\n\n             Glaum contends that the charged conspiracy ended when\n\nSalsberry    became   a   government      agent.     See    id.   at   699-700\n\n(explaining that a conspiracy cannot exist where one of the members\n\nis a government agent because a conspiracy requires the existence\n\nof two “genuine” parties).       But the Portela rule has no relevance\n\nhere because there was evidence that Glaum continued to work with\n\nother members of the conspiracy after Salsberry agreed to cooperate\n\nwith the DEA.     See United States v. Giry, 818 F.2d 120, 126 (1st\n\nCir. 1987) (noting that the rule providing that government agents\n\ndo not count as co-conspirators is relevant “only in situations\n\nwhere the conspiracy involve[d] one defendant and a government\n\ninformer”) (internal quotations omitted).          For example, Glaum told\n\nWolf that he knew “Dad real well” and that the marijuana in his\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fpossession was “all Dad” and was “Dad’s thing.”        The jury easily\n\ncould have concluded that Glaum’s statements were references to his\n\non-going work with the Old Man (whose other alias was \"Dad\").\n\nThere was thus sufficient evidence that Glaum continued to receive\n\nmarijuana from the supply end of the conspiracy after Salsberry’s\n\ndeparture from the organization.\n\n           There was also sufficient evidence to conclude that Glaum\n\ncontinued to work with the distribution end of the conspiracy.       In\n\nconversations with Wolf, Glaum described his continued work with\n\nRonnie Kerrigan, including his plans to travel to Maine to bring\n\nhim drugs. In addition, Eugene Monroe testified that Glaum ushered\n\nhim into the conspiracy only after Glaum encountered difficulties\n\nworking   with   Kerrigan.    Glaum’s   continuing   relationship   with\n\nKerrigan permitted the jury to conclude that he continued to deal\n\nwith distributors that he had met through his involvement in the\n\ncharged single conspiracy.4\n\n            B.     Entrapment\n\n           Glaum’s second claim challenges the jury’s decision to\n\nreject his entrapment defense.     Like the single-conspiracy issue\n\ndiscussed above, we review this claim under the sufficiency of the\n\n\n     4\n        Glaum also argues that his conviction must be overturned\nbecause the jury found him responsible for a smaller amount of\nmarijuana than was alleged in the indictment. There is no merit to\nthis argument.    The amount of drugs for which a defendant is\nresponsible is not an element which the government must prove to\nobtain a conviction. See United States v. Goodine, 326 F.3d 26,\n32-33 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                 -13-\n\fevidence rubric.      See United States v. LaFreniere, 236 F.3d 41, 45\n\n(1st Cir. 2001).      Thus, we consider the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the government, asking whether a rational jury could\n\nhave rejected Glaum’s entrapment defense.           United States v. Tom,\n\n330 F.3d 83, 89 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            The entrapment defense is two-pronged. It requires proof\n\nof (1) improper government inducement to commit the crime, and (2)\n\nlack of predisposition by the defendant to engage in criminal\n\nconduct.     See United States v. Gamache, 156 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).     To present an entrapment defense, the defendant must make\n\nan initial prima facie showing of proof raising the issue.                See\n\nTom, 330 F.3d at 89.     It is undisputed that Glaum made this initial\n\nshowing.\n\n            At this point, the burden shifts to the government to\n\nprove    beyond   a   reasonable   doubt   that   the   defendant   was   not\n\nentrapped.     Id.    Sufficient evidence that the government did not\n\nimproperly induce the crime or that the defendant was predisposed\n\ntowards criminal conduct defeats the entrapment defense.                  See\n\nUnited States v. Capelton, 350 F.3d 231, 242 (1st Cir. 2003).              We\n\nfocus here on predisposition, considering: (1) the character or\n\nreputation of the defendant; (2) whether the initial suggestion of\n\ncriminal activity was made by the government; (3) whether the\n\ndefendant was engaged in criminal activity for profit; (4) whether\n\nthe defendant showed reluctance to commit the offense; and (5) the\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fnature of the inducement offered by the government.          See United\n\nStates v. Nishnianidze, 342 F.3d 6, 17 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          Here, there was evidence to support the conclusion that\n\nGlaum was predisposed to criminal conduct.          Glaum emphasized to\n\nthe DEA agents his prior work distributing drugs, including that he\n\nhad been distributing marijuana, imported from Mexico, since he was\n\neighteen years old.    He also had been working with Salsberry in\n\npackaging and distributing drugs for several months before the\n\nDEA’s involvement, and had agreed to run the trafficking business\n\nin Salsberry’s absence.     Thus, there was ample evidence showing\n\nthat Glaum had the character and reputation of a drug dealer.          See\n\nUnited States v. Panet-Collazo, 960 F.2d 256, 259-60 (1st Cir.\n\n1992) (statement by defendant that he “worked with cocaine a lot”\n\nshows defendant’s predisposition to engage in criminal conduct).\n\n          In addition, after the DEA infiltrated the conspiracy,\n\nGlaum continued to act as an eager participant.         After receiving\n\nWolf’s pager number from Salsberry, Glaum contacted Wolf almost\n\nimmediately and, in their first conversation, offered to do “some\n\nbusiness.”    Thereafter, Glaum never expressed reluctance to work\n\nwith Wolf in organizing additional transactions because of their\n\nillegality.     Moreover,   the   evidence   that   Glaum   received    “a\n\npercentage” of the profits from Salsberry leaves little doubt that\n\nGlaum engaged in drug dealing for profit.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f           C.       Entrapment Instruction\n\n           Glaum    next     claims   that,   even   if     the   evidence    was\n\nsufficient to defeat his entrapment defense, the district court\n\nincorrectly instructed the jury on entrapment.              Relying on United\n\nStates v. Brooks, 215 F.3d 842, 845 (8th Cir. 2000), Glaum argues\n\nthat the jury should have been instructed that, for purposes of\n\nentrapment, the government was responsible for all of Salsberry’s\n\nconduct whether or not it was aware of the conduct.\n\n           In formulating its instructions, a district court is not\n\nrequired to parrot the language proffered by the parties.                     See\n\nUnited States v. Nivica, 887 F.2d 1110, 1124 (1st Cir. 1989).\n\nWithin wide margins, the district court retains the choice of the\n\nprecise words to be used in explaining the applicable law to the\n\njury.   See United States v. Paniagua-Ramos, 251 F.3d 242, 245 (1st\n\nCir. 2001).     Our role is to determine \"whether, taken as a whole,\n\nthe court's instructions fairly and adequately submitted the issues\n\nin the case to the jury.\"        Tom, 330 F.3d at 91.\n\n           The    district    court   instructed     that    \"[t]o   show    that\n\n[Glaum] was not entrapped the government must establish beyond a\n\nreasonable . . . doubt that a law enforcement officer or               Anthony\n\nSalsberry, after he began cooperating with law enforcement, did not\n\npersuade or talk [Glaum] into committing the crime.\" (Emphasis\n\nsupplied).      The district court also instructed that, for purposes\n\nof entrapment, \"it does not matter whether the government was aware\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fof Anthony Salsberry's communications either directly or indirectly\n\nwith [Glaum].\" The court's instruction captured the essence of the\n\ninstruction requested by Glaum.         There was no error.      See United\n\nStates v. Dray, 901 F.2d 1132, 1141 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n           D. Drug Quantity Calculation\n\n           Glaum's fourth claim of error is that the district court\n\ncredited   unreliable   evidence   in     coming   to   its   drug   quantity\n\ncalculation.5   Notwithstanding the jury’s determination that Glaum\n\nwas responsible for less than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana, the\n\ncourt concluded that he was responsible for 2,320 pounds (1,052\n\nkilograms) of marijuana.     In reaching this total, the district\n\ncourt relied, inter alia, on statements by Glaum that (1) he had\n\n300 pounds of marijuana in his possession on February 18, 2001, (2)\n\nhe dealt between 400 and 500 pounds of marijuana every two weeks\n\n(the court took the minimum possible amount of 800 pounds for a\n\nsingle two-week period), (3) in some weeks, he distributed up to\n\n600 pounds, and (4) that Monroe had approximately 100 pounds\n\n\n     5\n        In addition, Glaum contends that Apprendi v. New Jersey,\n530 U.S. 466 (2000), forbids the district court from sentencing him\nfor drug quantities in excess of the quantity found by the jury.\nHe acknowledges that we have previously rejected this argument, see\nUnited States v. Lopez-Lopez, 282 F.3d 1, 22 (1st Cir.), cert.\ndenied, 536 U.S. 949 (2002); United States v. Martinez-Medina, 279\nF.3d 105, 122 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 537 U.S. 921 (2002), but\nurges us to reconsider.     We decline his invitation. See United\nStates v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 436, 438-39 (1st Cir. 2002), cert.\ndenied, 123 S.Ct. 1607 (2003). Relatedly, Glaum asks us to declare\n21 U.S.C. § 841 facially unconstitutional because it conflicts with\nApprendi. We also rejected this argument in Lopez-Lopez, 282 F.3d\nat 22-23, and will not reconsider it here.\n\n                                   -17-\n\favailable on July 16, 2001.           The court also relied on statements\n\nfrom Monroe that Glaum had 120 pounds in his possession on July 24,\n\n2001 and another 400 pounds in his possession on July 25, 2001.\n\n          The district court determines drug quantity under a\n\npreponderance of the evidence standard.             See United States v.\n\nLaboy,   351 F.3d. 578, 582 (1st Cir. 2003).              We disturb a drug\n\nquantity determination only in cases of clear error.               See United\n\nStates v. Batista, 239 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir. 2001).              In cases such\n\nas this, where \"the amount [of drugs] seized does not represent the\n\nscale of the offense, the court. . . approximate[s] the quantity of\n\nthe controlled substance.\"            U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1, cmt. (n.12). In\n\nmaking such a determination, the district court need only make \"a\n\nreasoned approximation\" of the quantity involved. United States v.\n\nHuddleston, 194 F.3d 214, 224 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          As    set    forth   above,    the   district    court    relied   on\n\nstatements made by Glaum and Monroe during the course of the DEA’s\n\ninvestigation.        We   recently    observed   that    \"the   most   damning\n\nevidence of drug quantity [is] the defendant's own admissions.\"\n\nUnited States v. Cyr, 337 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2003).                 In any\n\nevent, the court acted reasonably in crediting Monroe's and Glaum’s\n\nadmissions.    Glaum has simply not offered a substantial reason for\n\nupsetting the district court’s primary role in making credibility\n\ndeterminations. See United States v. Picanso, 333 F.3d 21, 27 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (\"The appraisal of amount depends on inference drawing\n\n\n                                      -18-\n\fand . . . credibility and we are not only loath but forbidden to\n\nsubstitute our own de novo assessment for that of the judge who\n\ntried the case and heard the evidence first hand.\"); Huddleston,\n\n194 F.3d at 224 (noting, in context of reviewing district court’s\n\ndrug quantity calculation, that “credibility calls are grist for\n\nthe trial court mill”).6\n\n                  E. Sentencing Manipulation\n\n                  Glaum next claims that some portion of the drugs should\n\nhave       been    excluded    from   the       quantity           calculation        because   of\n\nsentencing manipulation.              Specifically, he claims that government\n\nagents,       including       Salsberry,        coerced            him   to   participate       in\n\nadditional deals in order to increase his sentence.\n\n                  \"[W]here government agents have improperly enlarged the\n\nscope or scale of the crime, the sentencing court has ample power\n\nto   deal     with     the    situation     .    .       .    by    excluding     the    tainted\n\ntransaction from the computation of relevant conduct.\"                                    United\n\nStates       v.    Montoya,    62   F.3d    1,       3       (1st    Cir.     1995)    (internal\n\nquotations and citations omitted) (emphasis in original). However,\n\nto prevail on a sentencing manipulation claim, the defendant must\n\nestablish \"extraordinary misconduct by the government.\"                                 Id. at 4\n\n\n\n       6\n        Additionally, Glaum argues that the district court\nerroneously relied on drug quantities from both the \"first\"\nconspiracy involving Salsberry and the \"second\" conspiracy\ninvolving Monroe in reaching the total. Our conclusion that the\nevidence supported the jury's determination that there was only one\nconspiracy disposes of this argument. See supra, at 11-13.\n\n                                            -19-\n\f(internal quotations and citations omitted).           \"[G]arden variety\n\nmanipulation claims\" do not suffice.        Id.\n\n          The     district      court    rejected    Glaum's     sentencing\n\nmanipulation claim because the DEA's continued pursuit of Glaum\n\npermitted the DEA to further infiltrate the conspiracy.                 The\n\ncourt's analysis was reasonable.           We have rejected sentencing\n\nmanipulation claims where the government extended the scope of its\n\ninvestigation into the defendant's conduct because it reasonably\n\nbelieved that further investigation would permit it to identify\n\nadditional drug dealers.       See Capelton, 350 F.3d at 246 (rejecting\n\nsentencing      manipulation     claim    where     government    extended\n\ninvestigation in order to identify additional drug dealers); United\n\nStates v. Terry, 240 F.3d 65, 71 (1st Cir. 2001) (rejecting\n\nsentencing manipulation claim where government acted in good faith\n\nwhen it extended duration of investigation to identify other\n\nmembers in drug network). So too here, as the government’s efforts\n\nresulted in Monroe's arrest.7\n\n\n\n\n     7\n        Glaum also argues that he was predisposed to commit only\nsmall drug transactions and that the DEA manipulated him into\nattempting larger transactions.    We are unpersuaded.    Evidence\nconcerning the defendant's predisposition is of marginal relevance\nto a sentencing manipulation claim. See Montoya, 62 F.3d at 4. In\nany event, Glaum's attempt to cast himself as a small-time drug\ndealer until the DEA's investigation is not the only (or even the\nmost plausible) reading of the record. The evidence showed that,\nprior to the DEA investigation, Glaum worked to organize\ntransportation of a one-ton shipment of marijuana.\n\n                                   -20-\n\f            F. Acceptance of Responsibility\n\n            Finally, Glaum claims that the district court erred by\n\nrefusing to grant him a reduction in his sentence for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility.       See U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1.           He contends that he is\n\nentitled to such a reduction because, before trial, he admitted\n\nresponsibility    for    the       offense    of    which    he   was       eventually\n\nconvicted.\n\n             Glaum was initially indicted for participating in a\n\nconspiracy     involving      100    or      more   kilograms        of     marijuana.\n\nSubsequently, a superseding indictment was issued charging Glaum\n\nwith   participating     in    a    conspiracy      involving     1,000         or     more\n\nkilograms of marijuana.            After this superseding indictment was\n\nissued, Glaum offered to plead guilty to the original charge.                           The\n\ngovernment refused this offer.            Glaum contends that, because the\n\njury found him guilty only of the original charge, he should\n\nreceive credit for accepting responsibility.                  The district court\n\nrejected this argument because it found Glaum responsible for over\n\n1,000 kilograms of marijuana, and Glaum denied responsibility for\n\nthese additional quantities.\n\n             To earn an acceptance of responsibility reduction, a\n\ndefendant     must,   inter    alia,      \"truthfully        admit        the    conduct\n\ncomprising the offense of conviction.\"              See U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 cmt.\n\n(n. 1(a)). In addition, he must \"truthfully [admit] or not falsely\n\n[deny]   any    additional     relevant        conduct      for   which         [he]    is\n\n\n                                       -21-\n\faccountable.\"       Id.; see also United States v. Hernandez Coplin, 24\n\nF.3d 312, 317 (1st Cir. 1994). The district court's rejection of an\n\nacceptance of responsibility claim is entitled to considerable\n\ndeference and can be overturned only on a showing of clear error.\n\nSee Capelton, 350 F.3d at 245.\n\n            Throughout     the    presentence       process,   Glaum     denied\n\nresponsibility for the relevant conduct attributed to him by the\n\ndistrict court.      At his sentencing, he told the court that \"[w]hat\n\nthey're saying I did, that's a crock of crap.\"             Glaum’s comment is\n\ncertainly    not     indicative   of    a     criminal   defendant   accepting\n\nresponsibility for his conduct.             See U.S.S.G. § 3E1.1 cmt. (n.\n\n1(a)) (\"A defendant who falsely denies, or frivolously contests,\n\nrelevant conduct that the court determines to be true has acted in\n\na manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\"); see\n\nalso United States v. Gonzalez, 12 F.3d 298, 300 (1st Cir. 1993).8\n\nBecause     Glaum    persisted    in   denying     his   participation    in   a\n\nconspiracy involving 1,000 or more kilograms of marijuana, the\n\ndistrict court's rejection of his acceptance of responsibility\n\nrequest was not clearly erroneous.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n       Glaum's decision to pursue an entrapment defense is also\ninconsistent with acceptance of responsibility. See Capelton, 350\nF.3d at 245 (noting that acceptance of responsibility reduction\nwill rarely be appropriate where defendant pursues entrapment\ndefense).\n\n                                       -22-\n\f                         III. Conclusion\n\n          For the reasons set forth above, we affirm the\n\nconviction and sentence of defendant Terrence Glaum.\n\n\n\n\n                              -23-\n\f",

Glaum Joins the Conspiracy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conspiracy underlying this prosecution operated to distribute Mexican-grown marijuana throughout the United States. The head of the conspiracy was a man known only as \"Jefe.\" He raised large crops of marijuana for shipment across the border. An individual known as the \"Old Man\" or \"Dad\" worked under Jefe as his chief distributor. The Old Man received large shipments of marijuana from Jefe to distribute to other dealers, including Anthony Salsberry, who operated out of San Diego. Salsberry, in turn, would distribute the marijuana to other smaller dealers, who would sell the drugs to users. Among Salsberry's customers were an individual in New York, Ralph Martino, and two individuals in Maine, Ronnie Kerrigan and Paul Sekenski.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of his operation, Salsberry employed Glaum's ex-wife, Sheila Case, to assist him in shipping the marijuana. In the middle of 2000, Case asked Salsberry if he could put Glaum \"to work.\" Salsberry agreed and provided Glaum with approximately fifty pounds of marijuana to sell in Arizona. In addition to his work distributing marijuana, Glaum assisted Salsberry in packaging the drugs. Working out of his garage, Glaum weighed, \"shrink wrapp[ed]\" and \"vacuum seal[ed]\" marijuana to prepare it for shipment. As compensation, Salsberry paid Glaum \"a percentage\" of the profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately the same time that Glaum started working for Salsberry, the Old Man offered Salsberry a two-ton load of marijuana to distribute. After a portion of the load was smuggled across the border, Salsberry obtained a sample to send to Martino to gauge his interest in purchasing the load.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-October 2000, after receiving word from Martino that he was interested, Salsberry met with Jefe and the Old Man in San Diego to discuss the Martino deal. At this meeting, Jefe and the Old Man told Salsberry that only one ton would be available immediately and that the other ton would be placed \"on hold\".<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Salsberry concluded the meeting by telling his superiors that he would organize the transportation of the load to Martino.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Salsberry knew that Martino could arrange to transport the shipment himself, but Salsberry preferred to find an alternate method so that he could charge Martino a higher fee. In a subsequent conversation with Glaum, Salsberry learned that Glaum had access to several trucks which could be used to ship the marijuana to New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after this conversation, Salsberry attended another meeting with Jefe and the Old Man. This time Glaum also attended, and Salsberry introduced him to the heads of the organization. At this meeting, Salsberry assured the Old Man and Jefe that Glaum was capable of organizing the transportation for the Martino deal but that he could not begin the transport for two weeks. The participants therefore agreed that for two weeks the deal would remain \"on hold.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Salsberry's Arrest and Cooperation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 14, 2000, during the two-week hiatus in the Martino deal, Salsberry was arrested after one of his drivers turned him in to authorities. After his arrest, Salsberry was incarcerated in San Diego. From jail, Salsberry called Glaum to check on the Martino deal and to inform him of his status. While Salsberry was incarcerated, he spoke to Glaum nearly every day. During these calls, Glaum assured Salsberry that \"he wouldn't let [him] down\" and that he \"wanted to keep things going.\" The two eventually agreed that Glaum would carry on Salsberry's business while Salsberry was in jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 18, 2000, Glaum sent his attorney, Phil Gagnon, to meet with Salsberry in jail. Gagnon served as an intermediary between Glaum and Salsberry, meeting with Salsberry on several occasions. At one of their meetings, Salsberry provided Gagnon with Ronnie Kerrigan's and the Old Man's telephone numbers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 17, 2001, Salsberry decided to cooperate with the government. Soon afterwards, Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\") Agent Paul Wolf traveled from Maine to California to debrief Salsberry. As part of his cooperation agreement, Salsberry agreed to remain in contact with Glaum and Gagnon and to provide Glaum with Wolf's pager number. Eventually, Salsberry gave Glaum the pager number, pretending that it belonged to Paul Sekenski.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Sting Operation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wolf returned to Maine from meeting with Salsberry on January 19, 2001. Two days later, he received an electronic page from Glaum. In their introductory call, Glaum identified himself as a friend of Salsberry and asked Wolf if he wanted \"to discuss doing some business.\" Glaum said that he soon would be traveling to Maine to bring drugs to Ronnie Kerrigan and that he would be able to deliver drugs to Wolf at that time. Wolf told him that he would have to \"check [him] out\" before placing an order. Glaum invited Wolf to call him when he was ready to deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 24, 2001, Wolf called Glaum. After Glaum explained how he had become associated with Salsberry, Wolf broached the subject of the Martino deal. Wolf asked Glaum if he knew Martino. Glaum stated that he knew \"of him\" but that he knew \"Dad real well.\" At the conclusion of the conversation, Glaum offered to send Wolf a small shipment of marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 30, 2001, Wolf and Glaum negotiated the smaller shipment that they had initially discussed on January 24th. Glaum agreed to send Wolf a ten-pound load. Wolf, in turn, rented a \"mail drop\" box to receive the shipment at a Mail Boxes Etc. in Saco, Maine. On February 10, 2001, Wolf provided the address to Glaum, and Glaum told him to expect the drugs to arrive in a package appearing to contain candles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 13, 2001, Glaum and Wolf again discussed the ten-pound shipment. This time they discussed payment. Wolf agreed to send half of the money immediately and to pay the rest when they met. In their next conversation, on February 18, 2001, they discussed the possibility of a larger shipment. Glaum offered to send a sample of the larger shipment or to bring it to Maine when he visited Kerrigan. He told Wolf that he had just obtained \"three hun[dred]\" pounds of marijuana and that the drugs were \"Dad's thing\" and were \"all Dad.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wolf received the ten-pound shipment on February 20, 2001. Wolf called that day to inform Glaum that the shipment had arrived. The next conversation between Wolf and Glaum took place on February 22, 2001, during which Wolf told Glaum that Martino was \"kinda anxious\" about the larger deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, Wolf arranged for DEA Agent Ralph Caruso to pose as Martino, in order to expand the investigation. On February 25, 2001, Wolf told Glaum that he had shared some of the ten-pound shipment with Martino and that, as a result, Martino wanted to meet to finalize the deal. Wolf asked Glaum if he could give Martino his telephone number. Glaum agreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The investigation then shifted to San Diego. Caruso and DEA Agent Judy Gustafson, who was posing as Martino's girlfriend, met with Glaum on February 29, 2001. Glaum told Caruso that he had arranged to transport the drugs. At their next meeting on March 1, 2001, Glaum insisted that Caruso provide immediate payment for the one-ton shipment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The DEA was unwilling to provide such a large payment to Glaum and accordingly shifted its focus to Gagnon, in the hope that it could arrange the Martino deal through him. After numerous attempts over several months, the agency abandoned this effort because Gagnon refused to take a \"proactive\" role in organizing the deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Caruso was unable to make progress through either Glaum or Gagnon, the DEA decided that Wolf should reinitiate contact with Glaum, and on July 16, 2001, Wolf placed a call to Glaum. During this call, Wolf asked Glaum about obtaining new shipments of marijuana. Glaum stated that he had quality marijuana available but that he was upset that he had not been paid for earlier shipments to Maine. He also said that he had a new person working in Bangor, Maine to oversee some of his affairs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wolf and Glaum proceeded to discuss the logistics for sending smaller shipments. Glaum suggested sending forty-pound lots on the same day to two different addresses. He said that he had been shipping between 400 and 500 pounds of marijuana every two weeks and that, in some weeks, he had sent 600 pounds. Glaum also explained that he had formed a shipping company called \"Simply Shipping\" through which he trafficked drugs. Glaum noted that his associate in Bangor, Eugene Monroe, had \"probably about a hundred pounds of marijuana\" on hand, and suggested that Wolf meet with him to set up a deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. \"Dealing\" with Monroe</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The day after Wolf's conversation with Glaum, he received an electronic page from Monroe. Monroe explained to Wolf that he was working with Glaum and that, going forward, Glaum wanted Monroe and Wolf to handle \"the account\" themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 24, 2001, Monroe met Wolf at a restaurant in Waterville, Maine. Monroe said that Glaum had taken over the business after Salsberry was incarcerated. He also explained that, because of difficulties that Glaum had encountered working with Ronnie Kerrigan, Glaum had hired him to oversee the Maine operations. Monroe described the method for shipping the drugs. The drugs would arrive from Simply Shipping in boxes with religious logos so as to dampen suspicions about their contents. Wolf provided Monroe with an address at a Mail Boxes Etc. in Scarborough, Maine, where Glaum could send the drugs. Monroe showed Wolf a sample of the available marijuana. After seeing the sample, Wolf placed an order for 100 pounds. Monroe responded that, prior to delivering such a large amount, he would have to check on availability with Glaum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, Monroe contacted Wolf and told him that, even though Glaum had 120 pounds of marijuana in his possession, only forty pounds were available to him. Monroe said that he would bring twenty five pounds to the same restaurant where they earlier had met and that Glaum would ship the rest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the afternoon of July 25, 2001, Monroe and Wolf met in the restaurant parking lot. Monroe placed the drugs in the backseat of Wolf's car.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The next morning, Wolf received a call from the Mail Boxes Etc. informing him that he had received two boxes from \"Faith Unity World Service\" sent by Simply Shipping. Both boxes contained vacuum sealed bricks of marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving the shipment, Wolf called Monroe to tell him that it had arrived. Monroe stated that Glaum had just received another 400 pounds of marijuana to distribute. On July 30, 2001, Monroe and Wolf made plans for Wolf to receive an additional twenty five pounds of drugs. The two agreed to meet in Brunswick, Maine, the following day. Monroe was arrested just as Wolf arrived at the meeting spot. At approximately the same time, Glaum was arrested in San Diego.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Trial and Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum was charged in a single-count indictment with conspiracy to distribute and to possess with the intent to distribute 1,000 or more kilograms of marijuana, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846 and 841(a)(1). After a five-day trial, the jury convicted Glaum but specifically found that he was responsible for only between 100 and 999 kilograms of marijuana. At sentencing, however, the district court determined that Glaum was responsible for 1,052 kilograms of marijuana. The court sentenced Glaum to 121 months of imprisonment and four years of supervised release. Glaum timely appealed from the conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum raises six main issues on appeal. First, he claims that the government failed to prove his participation in the single conspiracy alleged in the indictment. Second, he claims that he was entrapped. Third, he claims that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury on his entrapment defense. Fourth, he claims that the district court erred in its drug quantity calculations. Fifth, he claims that a portion of the drug quantity attributed to him should have been excluded because of sentencing manipulation. Sixth, he claims that the district court erred by declining to grant him credit for acceptance of responsibility. We address these claims seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Single Conspiracy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum argues that the government failed to prove that he was involved in the single conspiracy described in the indictment. The indictment alleged that, from the fall of 2000 until his arrest, on July 31, 2001, Glaum participated in a single conspiracy with Salsberry and others to distribute marijuana. Glaum asserts that the evidence established two separate conspiracies. The first involved Salsberry and concluded when Salsberry agreed to become a government agent; the second involved Monroe and concluded when Glaum was arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a given body of evidence proves one conspiracy or multiple conspiracies is an issue of fact. <i>See United States v. Portela,</i> 167 F.3d 687, 696 (1st Cir.1999). Thus, on appeal, we review the jury's single-conspiracy determination by asking whether the finding was rational given the evidence. <i>Id.</i> We have identified a non-exclusive list of factors to guide this inquiry: (1) was there evidence of a common purpose? (2) were the various elements of the plan interdependent? and (3) was there some degree of overlap among the participants? <i>See United States v. Rivera-Ruiz,</i> 244 F.3d 263, 268 (1st Cir. 2001); <i>Portela,</i> 167 F.3d at 695.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there was sufficient evidence to find Glaum guilty of participating in the charged single conspiracy. There was evidence that, in the fall of 2000, Glaum conspired with Salsberry to sell drugs. <i>See Portela,</i> 167 F.3d at 695 (goal of selling drugs for profit satisfies common goal requirement). After agreeing to join with Salsberry, Glaum performed several acts to further the goals of the conspiracy, including weighing and preparing drugs for shipment and sale and meeting with Salsberry's suppliers. Following Salsberry's arrest, Glaum agreed to assume Salsberry's role in the business and proceeded to honor this agreement, unaware that Salsberry had agreed to become a government agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum contends that the charged conspiracy ended when Salsberry became a government agent. <i>See id.</i> at 699-700 (explaining that a conspiracy cannot exist where one of the members is a government agent because a conspiracy requires the existence of two \"genuine\" parties). But the <i>Portela</i> rule has no relevance here because there was evidence that Glaum continued to work with other members of the conspiracy after Salsberry agreed to cooperate with the DEA. <i>See United States v. Giry,</i> 818 F.2d 120, 126 (1st Cir. 1987) (noting that the rule providing that government agents do not count as co-conspirators is relevant \"only in situations where the conspiracy involve[d] one defendant and a government informer\") (internal quotations omitted). For example, Glaum told Wolf that he knew \"Dad real well\" and that the marijuana in his possession was \"all Dad\" and was \"Dad's thing.\" The jury easily could have concluded that Glaum's statements were references to his on-going work with the Old Man (whose other alias was \"Dad\"). There was thus sufficient evidence that Glaum continued to receive marijuana from the supply end of the conspiracy after Salsberry's departure from the organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also sufficient evidence to conclude that Glaum continued to work with the distribution end of the conspiracy. In conversations with Wolf, Glaum described his continued work with Ronnie Kerrigan, including his plans to travel to Maine to bring him drugs. In addition, Eugene Monroe testified that Glaum ushered him into the conspiracy only after Glaum encountered difficulties working with Kerrigan. Glaum's continuing relationship with Kerrigan permitted the jury to conclude that he continued to deal with distributors that he had met through his involvement in the charged single conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Entrapment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum's second claim challenges the jury's decision to reject his entrapment defense. Like the single-conspiracy issue discussed above, we review this claim under the sufficiency of the evidence rubric. <i>See United States v. LaFreniere,</i> 236 F.3d 41, 45 (1st Cir.2001). Thus, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, asking whether a rational jury could have rejected Glaum's entrapment defense. <i>United States v. Tom,</i> 330 F.3d 83, 89 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The entrapment defense is two-pronged. It requires proof of (1) improper government inducement to commit the crime, and (2) lack of predisposition by the defendant to engage in criminal conduct. <i>See United States v. Gamache,</i> 156 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1998). To present an entrapment defense, the defendant must make an initial prima facie showing of proof raising the issue. <i>See Tom,</i> 330 F.3d at 89. It is undisputed that Glaum made this initial showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, the burden shifts to the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not entrapped. <i>Id.</i> Sufficient evidence that the government did not improperly induce the crime <i>or</i> that the defendant was predisposed towards criminal conduct defeats the entrapment defense. <i>See United States v. Capelton,</i> 350 F.3d 231, 242 (1st Cir.2003). We focus here on predisposition, considering: (1) the character or reputation of the defendant; (2) whether the initial suggestion of criminal activity was made by the government; (3) whether the defendant was engaged in criminal activity for profit; (4) whether the defendant showed reluctance to commit the offense; and (5) the nature of the inducement offered by the government. <i>See United States v. Nishnianidze,</i> 342 F.3d 6, 17 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there was evidence to support the conclusion that Glaum was predisposed to criminal conduct. Glaum emphasized to the DEA agents his prior work distributing drugs, including that he had been distributing marijuana, imported from Mexico, since he was eighteen years old. He also had been working with Salsberry in packaging and distributing drugs for several months before the DEA's involvement, and had agreed to run the trafficking business in Salsberry's absence. Thus, there was ample evidence showing that Glaum had the character and reputation of a drug dealer. <i>See United States v. Panet-Collazo,</i> 960 F.2d 256, 259-60 (1st Cir.1992) (statement by defendant that he \"worked with cocaine a lot\" shows defendant's predisposition to engage in criminal conduct).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, after the DEA infiltrated the conspiracy, Glaum continued to act as an eager participant. After receiving Wolf's pager number from Salsberry, Glaum contacted Wolf almost immediately and, in their first conversation, offered to do \"some business.\" Thereafter, Glaum never expressed reluctance to work with Wolf in organizing additional transactions because of their illegality. Moreover, the evidence that Glaum received \"a percentage\" of the profits from Salsberry leaves little doubt that Glaum engaged in drug dealing for profit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Entrapment Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum next claims that, even if the evidence was sufficient to defeat his entrapment defense, the district court incorrectly instructed the jury on entrapment. Relying on <i>United States v. Brooks,</i> 215 F.3d 842, 845 (8th Cir.2000), Glaum argues that the jury should have been instructed that, for purposes of entrapment, the government was responsible for all of Salsberry's conduct whether or not it was aware of the conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In formulating its instructions, a district court is not required to parrot the language proffered by the parties. <i>See United States v. Nivica,</i> 887 F.2d 1110, 1124 (1st Cir.1989). Within wide margins, the district court retains the choice of the precise words to be used in explaining the applicable law to the jury. <i>See United States v. Paniagua-Ramos,</i> 251 F.3d 242, 245 (1st Cir.2001). Our role is to determine \"whether, taken as a whole, the court's instructions fairly and adequately submitted the issues in the case to the jury.\" <i>Tom,</i> 330 F.3d at 91.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court instructed that \"[t]o show that [Glaum] was not entrapped the government must establish beyond a reasonable... doubt that a law enforcement officer <i>or Anthony Salsberry, after he began cooperating with law enforcement,</i> did not persuade or talk [Glaum] into committing the crime.\" (Emphasis supplied). The district court also instructed that, for purposes of entrapment, \"it does not matter whether the government was aware of Anthony Salsberry's communications either directly or indirectly with [Glaum].\" The court's instruction captured the essence of the instruction requested by Glaum. There was no error. <i>See United States v. Dray,</i> 901 F.2d 1132, 1141 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Drug Quantity Calculation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum's fourth claim of error is that the district court credited unreliable evidence in coming to its drug quantity calculation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Notwithstanding the jury's determination that Glaum was responsible for less than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana, the court concluded that he was responsible for 2,320 pounds (1,052 kilograms) of marijuana. In reaching this total, the district court relied, <i>inter alia,</i> on statements by Glaum that (1) he had 300 pounds of marijuana in his possession on February 18, 2001, (2) he dealt between 400 and 500 pounds of marijuana every two weeks (the court took the minimum possible amount of 800 pounds for a single two-week period), (3) in some weeks, he distributed up to 600 pounds, and (4) that Monroe had approximately 100 pounds available on July 16, 2001. The court also relied on statements from Monroe that Glaum had 120 pounds in his possession on July 24, 2001 and another 400 pounds in his possession on July 25, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determines drug quantity under a preponderance of the evidence standard. <i>See United States v. Laboy,</i> 351 F.3d 578, 582 (1st Cir.2003). We disturb a drug quantity determination only in cases of clear error. <i>See United States v. Batista,</i> 239 F.3d 16, 21 (1st Cir.2001). In cases such as this, where \"the amount [of drugs] seized does not represent the scale of the offense, the court ... approximate[s] the quantity of the controlled substance.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1, cmt. (n.12). In making such a determination, the district court need only make \"a reasoned approximation\" of the quantity involved. <i>United States v. Huddleston,</i> 194 F.3d 214, 224 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As set forth above, the district court relied on statements made by Glaum and Monroe during the course of the DEA's investigation. We recently observed that \"the most damning evidence of drug quantity [is] the defendant's own admissions.\" <i>United States v. Cyr,</i> 337 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir.2003). In any event, the court acted reasonably in crediting Monroe's and Glaum's admissions. Glaum has simply not offered a substantial reason for upsetting the district court's primary role in making credibility determinations. <i>See United States v. Picanso,</i> 333 F.3d 21, 27 (1st Cir.2003) (\"The appraisal of amount depends on inference drawing and ... credibility and we are not only loath but forbidden to substitute our own <i>de novo</i> assessment for that of the judge who tried the case and heard the evidence first hand.\"); <i>Huddleston,</i> 194 F.3d at 224 (noting, in context of reviewing district court's drug quantity calculation, that \"credibility calls are grist for the trial court mill\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Sentencing Manipulation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum next claims that some portion of the drugs should have been excluded from the quantity calculation because of sentencing manipulation. Specifically, he claims that government agents, including Salsberry, coerced him to participate in additional deals in order to increase his sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[W]here government agents have <i>improperly</i> enlarged the scope or scale of the crime, the sentencing court has ample power to deal with the situation ... by excluding the tainted transaction from the computation of relevant conduct.\" <i>United States v. Montoya,</i> 62 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1995) (internal quotations and citations omitted) (emphasis in original). However, to prevail on a sentencing manipulation claim, the defendant must establish \"extraordinary misconduct by the government.\" <i>Id.</i> at 4 (internal quotations and citations omitted). \"[G]arden variety manipulation claims\" do not suffice. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected Glaum's sentencing manipulation claim because the DEA's continued pursuit of Glaum permitted the DEA to further infiltrate the conspiracy. The court's analysis was reasonable. We have rejected sentencing manipulation claims where the government extended the scope of its investigation into the defendant's conduct because it reasonably believed that further investigation would permit it to identify additional drug dealers. <i>See Capelton,</i> 350 F.3d at 246 (rejecting sentencing manipulation claim where government extended investigation in order to identify additional drug dealers); <i>United States v. Terry,</i> 240 F.3d 65, 71 (1st Cir.2001) (rejecting sentencing manipulation claim where government acted in good faith when it extended duration of investigation to identify other members in drug network). So too here, as the government's efforts resulted in Monroe's arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Glaum claims that the district court erred by refusing to grant him a reduction in his sentence for acceptance of responsibility. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1. He contends that he is entitled to such a reduction because, before trial, he admitted responsibility for the offense of which he was eventually convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum was initially indicted for participating in a conspiracy involving 100 or more kilograms of marijuana. Subsequently, a superseding indictment was issued charging Glaum with participating in a conspiracy involving 1,000 or more kilograms of marijuana. After this superseding indictment was issued, Glaum offered to plead guilty to the original charge. The government refused this offer. Glaum contends that, because the jury found him guilty only of the original charge, he should receive credit for accepting responsibility. The district court rejected this argument because it found Glaum responsible for over 1,000 kilograms of marijuana, and Glaum denied responsibility for these additional quantities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To earn an acceptance of responsibility reduction, a defendant must, <i>inter alia,</i> \"truthfully admit the conduct comprising the offense of conviction.\" <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 cmt. (n. 1(a)). In addition, he must \"truthfully [admit] or not falsely [deny] any additional relevant conduct for which [he] is accountable.\" <i>Id.; see also United States v. Hernandez Coplin,</i> 24 F.3d 312, 317 (1st Cir.1994). The district court's rejection of an acceptance of responsibility claim is entitled to considerable deference and can be overturned only on a showing of clear error. <i>See Capelton,</i> 350 F.3d at 245.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the presentence process, Glaum denied responsibility for the relevant conduct attributed to him by the district court. At his sentencing, he told the court that \"[w]hat they're saying I did, that's a crock of crap.\" Glaum's comment is certainly not indicative of a criminal defendant accepting responsibility for his conduct. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 cmt. (n. 1(a)) (\"A defendant who falsely denies, or frivolously contests, relevant conduct that the court determines to be true has acted in a manner inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility.\"); <i>see also United States v. Gonzales,</i> 12 F.3d 298, 300 (1st Cir. 1993).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Because Glaum persisted in denying his participation in a conspiracy involving 1,000 or more kilograms of marijuana, the district court's rejection of his acceptance of responsibility request was not clearly erroneous.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons set forth above, we <i>affirm</i> the conviction and sentence of defendant Terrence Glaum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Martino later rejected the second ton because of its poor quality</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> During this meeting, Glaum admitted that he had been smuggling marijuana from Mexico since he was eighteen years old and that he had sent \"300 or 400 hundred in the mail without any problems.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Monroe delivered only twenty pounds of marijuana</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Glaum also argues that his conviction must be overturned because the jury found him responsible for a smaller amount of marijuana than was alleged in the indictment. There is no merit to this argument. The amount of drugs for which a defendant is responsible is not an element which the government must prove to obtain a conviction<i>See United States v. Goodine,</i> 326 F.3d 26, 32-33 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> In addition, Glaum contends that<i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), forbids the district court from sentencing him for drug quantities in excess of the quantity found by the jury. He acknowledges that we have previously rejected this argument, <i>see United States v. Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d 1, 22 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 536 U.S. 949, 122 S.Ct. 2642, 153 L.Ed.2d 821 (2002); <i>United States v. Martinez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d 105, 122 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 537 U.S. 921, 123 S.Ct. 311, 154 L.Ed.2d 210 (2002), but urges us to reconsider. We decline his invitation. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d 435, 438-39 (1st Cir.2002), <i>cert. denied,</i> 538 U.S. 937, 123 S.Ct. 1607, 155 L.Ed.2d 338 (2003). Relatedly, Glaum asks us to declare 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841 facially unconstitutional because it conflicts with <i>Apprendi.</i> We also rejected this argument in <i>Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d at 22-23, and will not reconsider it here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Additionally, Glaum argues that the district court erroneously relied on drug quantities from both the \"first\" conspiracy involving Salsberry and the \"second\" conspiracy involving Monroe in reaching the total. Our conclusion that the evidence supported the jury's determination that there was only one conspiracy disposes of this argument<i>See supra,</i> at 175-77.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Glaum also argues that he was predisposed to commit only small drug transactions and that the DEA manipulated him into attempting larger transactions. We are unpersuaded. Evidence concerning the defendant's predisposition is of marginal relevance to a sentencing manipulation claim<i>See Montoya,</i> 62 F.3d at 4. In any event, Glaum's attempt to cast himself as a small-time drug dealer until the DEA's investigation is not the only (or even the most plausible) reading of the record. The evidence showed that, prior to the DEA investigation, Glaum worked to organize transportation of a <i>one-ton</i> shipment of marijuana.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Glaum's decision to pursue an entrapment defense is also inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility<i>See Capelton,</i> 350 F.3d at 245 (noting that acceptance of responsibility reduction will rarely be appropriate where defendant pursues entrapment defense).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Glaum Joins the Conspiracy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The conspiracy underlying this prosecution operated to distribute Mexican-grown marijuana throughout the United States. The head of the conspiracy was a man known only as \"Jefe.\" He raised large crops of marijuana for shipment across the border. An individual known as the \"Old Man\" or \"Dad\" worked under Jefe as his chief distributor. The Old Man received large shipments of marijuana from Jefe to distribute to other dealers, including Anthony Salsberry, who operated out of San Diego. Salsberry, in turn, would distribute the marijuana to other smaller dealers, who would sell the drugs to users. Among Salsberry's customers were an individual in New York, Ralph Martino, and two individuals in Maine, Ronnie Kerrigan and Paul Sekenski.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As part of his operation, Salsberry employed Glaum's ex-wife, Sheila Case, to assist him in shipping the marijuana. In the middle of 2000, Case asked Salsberry if he could put Glaum \"to work.\" Salsberry agreed and provided Glaum with approximately fifty pounds of marijuana to sell in Arizona. In addition to his work distributing marijuana, Glaum assisted Salsberry in packaging the drugs. Working out of his garage, Glaum weighed, \"shrink wrapp[ed]\" and \"vacuum seal[ed]\" marijuana to prepare it for shipment. As compensation, Salsberry paid Glaum \"a percentage\" of the profits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately the same time that Glaum started working for Salsberry, the Old Man offered Salsberry a two-ton load of marijuana to distribute. After a portion of the load was smuggled across the border, Salsberry obtained a sample to send to Martino to gauge his interest in purchasing the load.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mid-October 2000, after receiving word from Martino that he was interested, Salsberry met with Jefe and the Old Man in San Diego to discuss the Martino deal. At this meeting, Jefe and the Old Man told Salsberry that only one ton would be available immediately and that the other ton would be placed \"on hold\".<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Salsberry concluded the meeting by telling his superiors that he would organize the transportation of the load to Martino.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Salsberry knew that Martino could arrange to transport the shipment himself, but Salsberry preferred to find an alternate method so that he could charge Martino a higher fee. In a subsequent conversation with Glaum, Salsberry learned that Glaum had access to several trucks which could be used to ship the marijuana to New York.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Soon after this conversation, Salsberry attended another meeting with Jefe and the Old Man. This time Glaum also attended, and Salsberry introduced him to the heads of the organization. At this meeting, Salsberry assured the Old Man and Jefe that Glaum was capable of organizing the transportation for the Martino deal but that he could not begin the transport for two weeks. The participants therefore agreed that for two weeks the deal would remain \"on hold.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Salsberry's Arrest and Cooperation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 14, 2000, during the two-week hiatus in the Martino deal, Salsberry was arrested after one of his drivers turned him in to authorities. After his arrest, Salsberry was incarcerated in San Diego. From jail, Salsberry called Glaum to check on the Martino deal and to inform him of his status. While Salsberry was incarcerated, he spoke to Glaum nearly every day. During these calls, Glaum assured Salsberry that \"he wouldn't let [him] down\" and that he \"wanted to keep things going.\" The two eventually agreed that Glaum would carry on Salsberry's business while Salsberry was in jail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 18, 2000, Glaum sent his attorney, Phil Gagnon, to meet with Salsberry in jail. Gagnon served as an intermediary between Glaum and Salsberry, meeting with Salsberry on several occasions. At one of their meetings, Salsberry provided Gagnon with Ronnie Kerrigan's and the Old Man's telephone numbers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 17, 2001, Salsberry decided to cooperate with the government. Soon afterwards, Drug Enforcement Agency (\"DEA\") Agent Paul Wolf traveled from Maine to California to debrief Salsberry. As part of his cooperation agreement, Salsberry agreed to remain in contact with Glaum and Gagnon and to provide Glaum with Wolf's pager number. Eventually, Salsberry gave Glaum the pager number, pretending that it belonged to Paul Sekenski.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. The Sting Operation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wolf returned to Maine from meeting with Salsberry on January 19, 2001. Two days later, he received an electronic page from Glaum. In their introductory call, Glaum identified himself as a friend of Salsberry and asked Wolf if he wanted \"to discuss doing some business.\" Glaum said that he soon would be traveling to Maine to bring drugs to Ronnie Kerrigan and that he would be able to deliver drugs to Wolf at that time. Wolf told him that he would have to \"check [him] out\" before placing an order. Glaum invited Wolf to call him when he was ready to deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 24, 2001, Wolf called Glaum. After Glaum explained how he had become associated with Salsberry, Wolf broached the subject of the Martino deal. Wolf asked Glaum if he knew Martino. Glaum stated that he knew \"of him\" but that he knew \"Dad real well.\" At the conclusion of the conversation, Glaum offered to send Wolf a small shipment of marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On January 30, 2001, Wolf and Glaum negotiated the smaller shipment that they had initially discussed on January 24th. Glaum agreed to send Wolf a ten-pound load. Wolf, in turn, rented a \"mail drop\" box to receive the shipment at a Mail Boxes Etc. in Saco, Maine. On February 10, 2001, Wolf provided the address to Glaum, and Glaum told him to expect the drugs to arrive in a package appearing to contain candles.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 13, 2001, Glaum and Wolf again discussed the ten-pound shipment. This time they discussed payment. Wolf agreed to send half of the money immediately and to pay the rest when they met. In their next conversation, on February 18, 2001, they discussed the possibility of a larger shipment. Glaum offered to send a sample of the larger shipment or to bring it to Maine when he visited Kerrigan. He told Wolf that he had just obtained \"three hun[dred]\" pounds of marijuana and that the drugs were \"Dad's thing\" and were \"all Dad.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wolf received the ten-pound shipment on February 20, 2001. Wolf called that day to inform Glaum that the shipment had arrived. The next conversation between Wolf and Glaum took place on February 22, 2001, during which Wolf told Glaum that Martino was \"kinda anxious\" about the larger deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, Wolf arranged for DEA Agent Ralph Caruso to pose as Martino, in order to expand the investigation. On February 25, 2001, Wolf told Glaum that he had shared some of the ten-pound shipment with Martino and that, as a result, Martino wanted to meet to finalize the deal. Wolf asked Glaum if he could give Martino his telephone number. Glaum agreed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The investigation then shifted to San Diego. Caruso and DEA Agent Judy Gustafson, who was posing as Martino's girlfriend, met with Glaum on February 29, 2001. Glaum told Caruso that he had arranged to transport the drugs. At their next meeting on March 1, 2001, Glaum insisted that Caruso provide immediate payment for the one-ton shipment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The DEA was unwilling to provide such a large payment to Glaum and accordingly shifted its focus to Gagnon, in the hope that it could arrange the Martino deal through him. After numerous attempts over several months, the agency abandoned this effort because Gagnon refused to take a \"proactive\" role in organizing the deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Caruso was unable to make progress through either Glaum or Gagnon, the DEA decided that Wolf should reinitiate contact with Glaum, and on July 16, 2001, Wolf placed a call to Glaum. During this call, Wolf asked Glaum about obtaining new shipments of marijuana. Glaum stated that he had quality marijuana available but that he was upset that he had not been paid for earlier shipments to Maine. He also said that he had a new person working in Bangor, Maine to oversee some of his affairs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wolf and Glaum proceeded to discuss the logistics for sending smaller shipments. Glaum suggested sending forty-pound lots on the same day to two different addresses. He said that he had been shipping between 400 and 500 pounds of marijuana every two weeks and that, in some weeks, he had sent 600 pounds. Glaum also explained that he had formed a shipping company called \"Simply Shipping\" through which he trafficked drugs. Glaum noted that his associate in Bangor, Eugene Monroe, had \"probably about a hundred pounds of marijuana\" on hand, and suggested that Wolf meet with him to set up a deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. \"Dealing\" with Monroe</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The day after Wolf's conversation with Glaum, he received an electronic page from Monroe. Monroe explained to Wolf that he was working with Glaum and that, going forward, Glaum wanted Monroe and Wolf to handle \"the account\" themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 24, 2001, Monroe met Wolf at a restaurant in Waterville, Maine. Monroe said that Glaum had taken over the business after Salsberry was incarcerated. He also explained that, because of difficulties that Glaum had encountered working with Ronnie Kerrigan, Glaum had hired him to oversee the Maine operations. Monroe described the method for shipping the drugs. The drugs would arrive from Simply Shipping in boxes with religious logos so as to dampen suspicions about their contents. Wolf provided Monroe with an address at a Mail Boxes Etc. in Scarborough, Maine, where Glaum could send the drugs. Monroe showed Wolf a sample of the available marijuana. After seeing the sample, Wolf placed an order for 100 pounds. Monroe responded that, prior to delivering such a large amount, he would have to check on availability with Glaum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Later that day, Monroe contacted Wolf and told him that, even though Glaum had 120 pounds of marijuana in his possession, only forty pounds were available to him. Monroe said that he would bring twenty five pounds to the same restaurant where they earlier had met and that Glaum would ship the rest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the afternoon of July 25, 2001, Monroe and Wolf met in the restaurant parking lot. Monroe placed the drugs in the backseat of Wolf's car.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> The next morning, Wolf received a call from the Mail Boxes Etc. informing him that he had received two boxes from \"Faith Unity World Service\" sent by Simply Shipping. Both boxes contained vacuum sealed bricks of marijuana.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After receiving the shipment, Wolf called Monroe to tell him that it had arrived. Monroe stated that Glaum had just received another 400 pounds of marijuana to distribute. On July 30, 2001, Monroe and Wolf made plans for Wolf to receive an additional twenty five pounds of drugs. The two agreed to meet in Brunswick, Maine, the following day. Monroe was arrested just as Wolf arrived at the meeting spot. At approximately the same time, Glaum was arrested in San Diego.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">E. Trial and Sentence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum was charged in a single-count indictment with conspiracy to distribute and to possess with the intent to distribute 1,000 or more kilograms of marijuana, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 846 and 841(a)(1). After a five-day trial, the jury convicted Glaum but specifically found that he was responsible for only between 100 and 999 kilograms of marijuana. At sentencing, however, the district court determined that Glaum was responsible for 1,052 kilograms of marijuana. The court sentenced Glaum to 121 months of imprisonment and four years of supervised release. Glaum timely appealed from the conviction and sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum raises six main issues on appeal. First, he claims that the government failed to prove his participation in the single conspiracy alleged in the indictment. Second, he claims that he was entrapped. Third, he claims that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury on his entrapment defense. Fourth, he claims that the district court erred in its drug quantity calculations. Fifth, he claims that a portion of the drug quantity attributed to him should have been excluded because of sentencing manipulation. Sixth, he claims that the district court erred by declining to grant him credit for acceptance of responsibility. We address these claims seriatim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Single Conspiracy</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum argues that the government failed to prove that he was involved in the single conspiracy described in the indictment. The indictment alleged that, from the fall of 2000 until his arrest, on July 31, 2001, Glaum participated in a single conspiracy with Salsberry and others to distribute marijuana. Glaum asserts that the evidence established two separate conspiracies. The first involved Salsberry and concluded when Salsberry agreed to become a government agent; the second involved Monroe and concluded when Glaum was arrested.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a given body of evidence proves one conspiracy or multiple conspiracies is an issue of fact. <i>See United States v. Portela,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"761694\"><a href=\"/opinion/761694/united-states-v-rafael-portela-united-states-of-america-v-francisco/\"><span class=\"volume\">167</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">687</span></a></span>, 696 (1st Cir.1999). Thus, on appeal, we review the jury's single-conspiracy determination by asking whether the finding was rational given the evidence. <i>Id.</i> We have identified a non-exclusive list of factors to guide this inquiry: (1) was there evidence of a common purpose? (2) were the various elements of the plan interdependent? and (3) was there some degree of overlap among the participants? <i>See United States v. Rivera-Ruiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199357\"><a href=\"/opinion/199357/united-states-v-rivera-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">244</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">263</span></a></span>, 268 (1st Cir. 2001); <i>Portela,</i> 167 F.3d at 695.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there was sufficient evidence to find Glaum guilty of participating in the charged single conspiracy. There was evidence that, in the fall of 2000, Glaum conspired with Salsberry to sell drugs. <i>See Portela,</i> 167 F.3d at 695 (goal of selling drugs for profit satisfies common goal requirement). After agreeing to join with Salsberry, Glaum performed several acts to further the goals of the conspiracy, including weighing and preparing drugs for shipment and sale and meeting with Salsberry's suppliers. Following Salsberry's arrest, Glaum agreed to assume Salsberry's role in the business and proceeded to honor this agreement, unaware that Salsberry had agreed to become a government agent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum contends that the charged conspiracy ended when Salsberry became a government agent. <i>See id.</i> at 699-700 (explaining that a conspiracy cannot exist where one of the members is a government agent because a conspiracy requires the existence of two \"genuine\" parties). But the <i>Portela</i> rule has no relevance here because there was evidence that Glaum continued to work with other members of the conspiracy after Salsberry agreed to cooperate with the DEA. <i>See United States v. Giry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"488024\"><a href=\"/opinion/488024/united-states-v-pierre-michel-henri-giry-and-steven-seward/\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span>, 126 (1st Cir. 1987) (noting that the rule providing that government agents do not count as co-conspirators is relevant \"only in situations where the conspiracy involve[d] one defendant and a government informer\") (internal quotations omitted). For example, Glaum told Wolf that he knew \"Dad real well\" and that the marijuana in his possession was \"all Dad\" and was \"Dad's thing.\" The jury easily could have concluded that Glaum's statements were references to his on-going work with the Old Man (whose other alias was \"Dad\"). There was thus sufficient evidence that Glaum continued to receive marijuana from the supply end of the conspiracy after Salsberry's departure from the organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was also sufficient evidence to conclude that Glaum continued to work with the distribution end of the conspiracy. In conversations with Wolf, Glaum described his continued work with Ronnie Kerrigan, including his plans to travel to Maine to bring him drugs. In addition, Eugene Monroe testified that Glaum ushered him into the conspiracy only after Glaum encountered difficulties working with Kerrigan. Glaum's continuing relationship with Kerrigan permitted the jury to conclude that he continued to deal with distributors that he had met through his involvement in the charged single conspiracy.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Entrapment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum's second claim challenges the jury's decision to reject his entrapment defense. Like the single-conspiracy issue discussed above, we review this claim under the sufficiency of the evidence rubric. <i>See United States v. LaFreniere,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199220\"><a href=\"/opinion/199220/united-states-v-lafreniere/\"><span class=\"volume\">236</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2001). Thus, we consider the evidence in the light most favorable to the government, asking whether a rational jury could have rejected Glaum's entrapment defense. <i>United States v. Tom,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782082\"><a href=\"/opinion/782082/united-states-v-luis-tom-aka-cuba/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 89 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The entrapment defense is two-pronged. It requires proof of (1) improper government inducement to commit the crime, and (2) lack of predisposition by the defendant to engage in criminal conduct. <i>See United States v. Gamache,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198087\"><a href=\"/opinion/198087/united-states-v-gamache/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1998). To present an entrapment defense, the defendant must make an initial prima facie showing of proof raising the issue. <i>See Tom,</i> 330 F.3d at 89. It is undisputed that Glaum made this initial showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this point, the burden shifts to the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was not entrapped. <i>Id.</i> Sufficient evidence that the government did not improperly induce the crime <i>or</i> that the defendant was predisposed towards criminal conduct defeats the entrapment defense. <i>See United States v. Capelton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200745\"><a href=\"/opinion/200745/united-states-v-capelton/\"><span class=\"volume\">350</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">231</span></a></span>, 242 (1st Cir.2003). We focus here on predisposition, considering: (1) the character or reputation of the defendant; (2) whether the initial suggestion of criminal activity was made by the government; (3) whether the defendant was engaged in criminal activity for profit; (4) whether the defendant showed reluctance to commit the offense; and (5) the nature of the inducement offered by the government. <i>See United States v. Nishnianidze,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200612\"><a href=\"/opinion/200612/united-states-v-nishniandze/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, there was evidence to support the conclusion that Glaum was predisposed to criminal conduct. Glaum emphasized to the DEA agents his prior work distributing drugs, including that he had been distributing marijuana, imported from Mexico, since he was eighteen years old. He also had been working with Salsberry in packaging and distributing drugs for several months before the DEA's involvement, and had agreed to run the trafficking business in Salsberry's absence. Thus, there was ample evidence showing that Glaum had the character and reputation of a drug dealer. <i>See United States v. Panet-Collazo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"580701\"><a href=\"/opinion/580701/united-states-v-pablo-panet-collazo-united-states-v-ruben-santana-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">960</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">256</span></a></span>, 259-60 (1st Cir.1992) (statement by defendant that he \"worked with cocaine a lot\" shows defendant's predisposition to engage in criminal conduct).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition, after the DEA infiltrated the conspiracy, Glaum continued to act as an eager participant. After receiving Wolf's pager number from Salsberry, Glaum contacted Wolf almost immediately and, in their first conversation, offered to do \"some business.\" Thereafter, Glaum never expressed reluctance to work with Wolf in organizing additional transactions because of their illegality. Moreover, the evidence that Glaum received \"a percentage\" of the profits from Salsberry leaves little doubt that Glaum engaged in drug dealing for profit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Entrapment Instruction</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum next claims that, even if the evidence was sufficient to defeat his entrapment defense, the district court incorrectly instructed the jury on entrapment. Relying on <i>United States v. Brooks,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"769099\"><a href=\"/opinion/769099/united-states-v-terry-lee-brooks/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">842</span></a></span>, 845 (8th Cir.2000), Glaum argues that the jury should have been instructed that, for purposes of entrapment, the government was responsible for all of Salsberry's conduct whether or not it was aware of the conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In formulating its instructions, a district court is not required to parrot the language proffered by the parties. <i>See United States v.

Within wide margins, the district court retains the choice of the precise words to be used in explaining the applicable law to the jury. <i>See United States v.

Our role is to determine \"whether, taken as a whole, the court's instructions fairly and adequately submitted the issues in the case to the jury.\" <i>Tom,</i> 330 F.3d at 91.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court instructed that \"[t]o show that [Glaum] was not entrapped the government must establish beyond a reasonable... doubt that a law enforcement officer <i>or Anthony Salsberry, after he began cooperating with law enforcement,</i> did not persuade or talk [Glaum] into committing the crime.\" (Emphasis supplied). The district court also instructed that, for purposes of entrapment, \"it does not matter whether the government was aware of Anthony Salsberry's communications either directly or indirectly with [Glaum].\" The court's instruction captured the essence of the instruction requested by Glaum. There was no error. <i>See United States v. Dray,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"540329\"><a href=\"/opinion/540329/united-states-v-richard-m-dray/\"><span class=\"volume\">901</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1132</span></a></span>, 1141 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Drug Quantity Calculation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum's fourth claim of error is that the district court credited unreliable evidence in coming to its drug quantity calculation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Notwithstanding the jury's determination that Glaum was responsible for less than 1,000 kilograms of marijuana, the court concluded that he was responsible for 2,320 pounds (1,052 kilograms) of marijuana. In reaching this total, the district court relied, <i>inter alia,</i> on statements by Glaum that (1) he had 300 pounds of marijuana in his possession on February 18, 2001, (2) he dealt between 400 and 500 pounds of marijuana every two weeks (the court took the minimum possible amount of 800 pounds for a single two-week period), (3) in some weeks, he distributed up to 600 pounds, and (4) that Monroe had approximately 100 pounds available on July 16, 2001. The court also relied on statements from Monroe that Glaum had 120 pounds in his possession on July 24, 2001 and another 400 pounds in his possession on July 25, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court determines drug quantity under a preponderance of the evidence standard. <i>See United States v.

In cases such as this, where \"the amount [of drugs] seized does not represent the scale of the offense, the court ... approximate[s] the quantity of the controlled substance.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1, cmt. (n.12). In making such a determination, the district court need only make \"a reasoned approximation\" of the quantity involved. <i>United States v.

In any event, the court acted reasonably in crediting Monroe's and Glaum's admissions.

The court's analysis was reasonable. We have rejected sentencing manipulation claims where the government extended the scope of its investigation into the defendant's conduct because it reasonably believed that further investigation would permit it to identify additional drug dealers. <i>See Capelton,</i> 350 F.3d at 246 (rejecting sentencing manipulation claim where government extended investigation in order to identify additional drug dealers); <i>United States v.

Acceptance of Responsibility</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Glaum claims that the district court erred by refusing to grant him a reduction in his sentence for acceptance of responsibility. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1. He contends that he is entitled to such a reduction because, before trial, he admitted responsibility for the offense of which he was eventually convicted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Glaum was initially indicted for participating in a conspiracy involving 100 or more kilograms of marijuana. Subsequently, a superseding indictment was issued charging Glaum with participating in a conspiracy involving 1,000 or more kilograms of marijuana. After this superseding indictment was issued, Glaum offered to plead guilty to the original charge. The government refused this offer. Glaum contends that, because the jury found him guilty only of the original charge, he should receive credit for accepting responsibility. The district court rejected this argument because it found Glaum responsible for over 1,000 kilograms of marijuana, and Glaum denied responsibility for these additional quantities.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To earn an acceptance of responsibility reduction, a defendant must, <i>inter alia,</i> \"truthfully admit the conduct comprising the offense of conviction.\" <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 cmt. (n. 1(a)). In addition, he must \"truthfully [admit] or not falsely [deny] any additional relevant conduct for which [he] is accountable.\" <i>Id.; see also United States v.

The district court's rejection of an acceptance of responsibility claim is entitled to considerable deference and can be overturned only on a showing of clear error. <i>See Capelton,</i> 350 F.3d at 245.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Throughout the presentence process, Glaum denied responsibility for the relevant conduct attributed to him by the district court. At his sentencing, he told the court that \"[w]hat they're saying I did, that's a crock of crap.\" Glaum's comment is certainly not indicative of a criminal defendant accepting responsibility for his conduct. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3E1.1 cmt.

Relatedly, Glaum asks us to declare 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841 facially unconstitutional because it conflicts with <i>Apprendi.</i> We also rejected this argument in <i>Lopez-Lopez,</i> 282 F.3d at 22-23, and will not reconsider it here.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Additionally, Glaum argues that the district court erroneously relied on drug quantities from both the \"first\" conspiracy involving Salsberry and the \"second\" conspiracy involving Monroe in reaching the total. Our conclusion that the evidence supported the jury's determination that there was only one conspiracy disposes of this argument<i>See supra,</i> at 175-77.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Glaum also argues that he was predisposed to commit only small drug transactions and that the DEA manipulated him into attempting larger transactions. We are unpersuaded. Evidence concerning the defendant's predisposition is of marginal relevance to a sentencing manipulation claim<i>See Montoya,</i> 62 F.3d at 4. In any event, Glaum's attempt to cast himself as a small-time drug dealer until the DEA's investigation is not the only (or even the most plausible) reading of the record. The evidence showed that, prior to the DEA investigation, Glaum worked to organize transportation of a <i>one-ton</i> shipment of marijuana.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Glaum's decision to pursue an entrapment defense is also inconsistent with acceptance of responsibility<i>See Capelton,</i> 350 F.3d at 245 (noting that acceptance of responsibility reduction will rarely be appropriate where defendant pursues entrapment defense).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
