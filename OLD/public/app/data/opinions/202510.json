On August 22, 2005, a jury\n\nfound    Andrew    S.     Hood       (\"Hood\")       guilty    of    receipt    of   child\n\npornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(2) and possession\n\nof child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(4)(B).\n\nHood challenges his conviction on the ground that his rights under\n\nthe Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3161 et seq., were violated.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we affirm Hood's conviction.\n\n                                         I.    Facts\n\n              In 2004, investigators from the United States Postal\n\nService, armed with a search warrant, reviewed records of a credit\n\ncard    processor       known       to   do   business       with    a   Russian    child\n\npornography distributor.             Hood's name appeared in the processor's\n\nrecords.      Postal investigators sent a letter to Hood soliciting an\n\norder for child pornography videotapes.                  Hood responded by mailing\n\nan    order    form     and     a    money    order     for    $125      to   the   postal\n\ninvestigators. When Hood arrived at the post office to collect his\n\nvideotapes, he was detained by a postal investigator.                         After being\n\nread his Miranda rights, Hood admitted ordering the videotapes and\n\nfurther admitted possessing additional child pornography on his\n\ncomputer.1      Hood was indicted by a grand jury on March 16, 2005.\n\nOn March 21, Hood was arrested; the district court appointed Leslie\n\nFeldman-Rumpler (\"Feldman-Rumpler\") as Hood's attorney and the\n\nGovernment moved for pretrial detention.                     Hood later obtained his\n\n\n1\n     Apparently, Hood was not arrested at this time.\n\n                                              -2-\n\fown   counsel,   Robert   D.   Lewin,   who   entered   an    appearance   on\n\nApril 11.     On April 12, the court held a detention hearing for\n\nHood.    On   April   13,   Feldman-Rumpler,     Hood's      court-appointed\n\nattorney, filed a motion to withdraw as counsel.             The court held\n\nanother detention hearing on April 21, during which the court\n\ngranted the Government's motion for pretrial detention, but did not\n\nset the conditions of the detention.          On April 29, Hood and the\n\nGovernment attended an initial status conference.             On May 4, the\n\ncourt granted Feldman-Rumpler's motion to withdraw and entered an\n\n\"Order of Excludable Delay,\" stating that for purposes of the\n\nSpeedy Trial Act, as of May 31, only \"six non-excludable days\"\n\n(April 22 - April 28) had passed since Hood's arrest.2\n\n            On May 10, the court held a release hearing, during which\n\nit determined conditions for Hood's release from jail. On June 15,\n\nHood and the Government filed a \"Final Status Conference Joint\n\nMemorandum\" representing that there were no discovery issues known\n\nor anticipated, no schedule needed to be set, a plea was unlikely,\n\nand the trial would take no more than four days.             The order also\n\nrepresented that there were no periods of excludable delay other\n\nthan those mentioned in the May 4 order.        The court held the final\n\nstatus conference on June 16, and entered a \"Further Order of\n\n\n\n\n2\n   This time period actually encompasses seven days, counting both\nApril 22 and April 28. However, as we later explain, this time\nperiod is excludable.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fExcludable Delay,\" stating that as of June 16, twenty-one non-\n\nexcludable days had passed since Hood's arrest.\n\n            On   June    24,     the    court   scheduled   a    status/pretrial\n\nconference for June 29.           The court cancelled the conference on\n\nJune 28.     On July 12, the Government filed a motion for a new\n\npretrial conference and to exclude time from June 29 until the new\n\npretrial conference.       On July 20, Hood agreed to the Government's\n\nproposed pretrial conference and filed his opposition to the motion\n\nto exclude time.          On July 21, the court ordered a pretrial\n\nconference to be held on August 4.\n\n            On August 4, at the pretrial conference, Hood filed a\n\n\"Motion to Dismiss the Indictment with Prejudice for Lack of a\n\nSpeedy Trial.\"     The Government filed two motions to exclude time\n\nfrom April 13 - May 4 and from July 12 - August 4.                     The court\n\ngranted both of the Government's motions to exclude time and denied\n\nHood's motion to dismiss. The court scheduled trial for August 22.\n\nHood was tried and convicted of receipt of child pornography in\n\nviolation   of   18     U.S.C.    §    2252(a)(2)   and   possession   of   child\n\npornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 2252(a)(4)(B).\n\n                                 II.    Discussion\n\n            We review \"the district court's denial of a motion to\n\ndismiss based upon the Speedy Trial Act de novo as to legal rulings\n\nand for clear error as to factual findings.\"                    United States v.\n\nMaxwell, 351 F.3d 35, 37 (1st Cir. 2003).                 The Speedy Trial Act\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\frequires that a court grant a defendant's motion to dismiss for\n\nlack of a speedy trial if the defendant is not brought to trial\n\nwithin seventy non-excludable days. 18 U.S.C. §§ 3161, 3162(a)(2).\n\n            In reviewing a claim under the Speedy Trial Act, we must\n\nfirst    calculate    \"the   aggregate       time     elapsed   awaiting       trial.\"\n\nUnited States v. Barnes, 159 F.3d 4, 10 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting\n\nUnited    States    v.   Staula,     80   F.3d    596,    600   (1st    Cir.   1996))\n\n(internal quotation marks omitted).              The speedy trial clock begins\n\nticking on the day a defendant first appears in court and stops the\n\nday the defendant files a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy\n\ntrial.     See Staula, 80 F.3d at 600.             Hood was arrested and first\n\nappeared in court on March 21; he filed his motion to dismiss on\n\nAugust 4.        We thus calculate that a total of 137 days elapsed\n\nbetween Hood's arrest and his motion to dismiss.\n\n            Next, we determine how many days should be excluded under\n\nthe Speedy Trial Act.           Barnes, 159 F.3d at 10.                Time may be\n\nexcluded    under    the   Speedy    Trial      Act   for,   inter     alia,   \"delay\n\nresulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion\n\nthrough    the     conclusion   of    the       hearing   on,   or     other   prompt\n\ndisposition of, such motion,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1)(F), and \"delay\n\nreasonably attributable to any period, not to exceed thirty days,\n\nduring which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually\n\nunder advisement by the court,\" 18 U.S.C. § 3161(h)(1)(J).                       Hood\n\ndoes not challenge the orders of exclusion entered on May 4 and\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\fJune 16, which provided for a total of sixty-six excludable days.\n\nFurther, the day the motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial\n\nis filed is excludable as delay resulting from a pretrial motion.\n\nUnited States v. Rodríguez, 63 F.3d 1159, 1163-64 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\nThus,   we    calculate    sixty-seven    days   that    are     undisputedly\n\nexcludable under the Speedy Trial Act.\n\n             Hood argues that the Government uses \"pretext\" for the\n\nadditional exclusions of time that they seek.           More specifically,\n\nhe adds that two periods of time are evidence of pretext: (1) the\n\nGovernment's attempted expansion of seven days (associated with\n\nFeldman-Rumpler's motion to withdraw) beyond the court's original\n\nexclusion of time, when the Government had agreed earlier that the\n\nadditional time was not excludable, and (2) the time resulting from\n\nthe court's unexplained cancellation of the pretrial conference.\n\n             We have previously held that the Speedy Trial Act sets\n\nbright-line rules, and we will not distinguish between exclusions\n\nbased on \"significant or complex 'pretrial motions' and simple or\n\nroutine motions.\"         Barnes, 159 F.3d at 11.        However, we have\n\ncautioned that \"neither counsel nor district courts may employ\n\nmeasures for excluding time from the speedy trial clock that\n\nimpermissibly    frustrate    the   [Speedy   Trial     Act]'s    purpose   of\n\nprotecting the shared interest of criminal defendants and the\n\npublic in 'bringing criminal charges to the bar of justice as\n\npromptly as practicable.'\" United States v. Richardson, 421 F.3d\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f17, 29 (1st Cir. 2005); see also United States v. Scott, 270 F.3d\n\n30, 54-57 (1st Cir. 2001) (reversing on the basis of the district\n\ncourt's unauthorized late decisions on motions); Staula, 80 F.3d at\n\n602 n.3 (\"We will not permit either the district court or the\n\nprosecution to jerry-build a 'hearing' in order to thwart the\n\nconcinnous operation of the Speedy Trial Act.\").\n\n              The Government sought, and the court granted, exclusion\n\nfor April 13 - May 4, during which Feldman-Rumpler's motion to\n\nwithdraw was pending.      Hood argues that this period should not be\n\nexcluded because Feldman-Rumpler's motion to withdraw did not\n\nactually delay the proceedings in the case.           Hood points out that\n\nhis new attorney, Mr. Lewin, had already begun participating in the\n\ntrial before Feldman-Rumpler offered her motion to withdraw, and\n\nthus no delay resulted.\n\n              We have stated that the pendency of a pretrial motion is\n\nexcludable time regardless of its type or its actual effect on the\n\ntrial.   See Rodríguez, 63 F.3d at 1166 (\"[I]t is clear in this\n\nCircuit as in others that the exclusions of § 3161(h)(1)(F) and (J)\n\nare 'automatic,' and do not depend upon any showing of actual\n\ndelay.\"); see also United States v. Daychild, 357 F.3d 1082, 1095\n\n(9th Cir. 2004) (excluding time during which a defense counsel's\n\nmotion   to    withdraw   was   pending    because   \"the   language   of   the\n\nstatutory exclusion for delay . . . is unqualified as to the type\n\nof motion\").      Furthermore, we do not see any evidence that the\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fmotion to withdraw was part of a Government attempt to frustrate\n\nthe operation of the Speedy Trial Act; to the contrary, the motion\n\nwas filed by Hood's own attorney.3    Thus, the district court did\n\nnot err in excluding an additional seven days on account of\n\nFeldman-Rumpler's motion to withdraw.4\n\n           Accordingly, we add an additional seven excludable days\n\nto the sixty-seven undisputed excludable days, for a total of\n\nseventy-four excludable days.   Subtracting seventy-four excludable\n\ndays from 137 total days, we find that there could have been no\n\nmore than sixty-three non-excludable days prior to Hood's motion to\n\ndismiss.   Given that this falls well under the maximum of seventy\n\nnon-excludable days permitted by the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3161, we find that the district court properly denied Hood's\n\nmotion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial.      Because of this\n\ncalculation, we do not need to address the defendant's argument\n\nabout the cancellation of the pretrial conference.        We wish,\n\nthough, to discourage the cancellations of pretrial conference\n\n\n3\n     Hood claims that the Government must be held to its\nrepresentation about the amount of excludable time in the Final\nStatus Conference Joint Memorandum.   However, at oral argument,\nHood conceded that the Memorandum was a status report, not a\nbinding stipulation.     The district court acted within its\ndiscretion in later concluding that additional time was properly\nexcluded under the Speedy Trial Act.\n4\n   On May 4, the court excluded the periods from April 13 - April\n21 and from April 29 - May 4, neither of which has been challenged\nby Hood.    Thus, the district court only needed to exclude an\nadditional seven days, from April 22 - April 28, to account for\nFeldman-Rumpler's pending motion to withdraw.\n\n                                -8-\n\fdates without setting new dates and without explanation.     Such\n\npractices can create potential Speedy Trial Act problems, as this\n\ncase illustrates.\n\n                        III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f",

Hood's name appeared in the processor's records. Postal investigators sent a letter to Hood soliciting an order for child pornography videotapes. Hood responded by mailing an order form and a money order for $125 to the postal investigators. When Hood arrived at the post office to collect his videotapes, he was detained by a postal investigator. After being read his <i>Miranda</i> rights, Hood admitted ordering the videotapes and further admitted possessing additional child pornography on his computer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Hood was indicted by a grand jury on March 16, 2005. On March 21, Hood was arrested; the district court appointed Leslie Feldman-Rumpler (\"Feldman-Rumpler\") as Hood's attorney and the Government moved for pretrial detention. Hood later obtained his own counsel, Robert D. Lewin, who entered an appearance on April 11. On April 12, the court held a detention hearing for Hood. On April 13, Feldman-Rumpler, Hood's court-appointed attorney, filed a motion to withdraw as counsel. The court held another detention hearing on April 21, during which the court granted the Government's motion for pretrial detention, but did not set the conditions of the detention. On April 29, Hood and the Government attended an initial status conference. On May 4, the court granted Feldman-Rumpler's motion to withdraw and entered an \"Order of Excludable Delay,\" stating that for purposes of the Speedy Trial Act, as of May 31, only \"six non-excludable days\" (April 22 &#8212; April 28) had passed since Hood's arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 10, the court held a release hearing, during which it determined conditions for Hood's release from jail.

The order also represented that there were no periods of excludable delay other than those mentioned in the May 4 order. The court held the final status conference on June 16, and entered a \"Further Order of Excludable Delay,\" stating that as of June 16, twenty-one non-excludable days had passed since Hood's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 24, the court scheduled a status/pretrial conference for June 29.

Hood does not challenge the orders of exclusion entered on May 4 and June 16, which provided for a total of sixty-six excludable days. Further, the day the motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial is filed is excludable as delay resulting from a pretrial motion. <i>United States v. Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 63 F.3d 1159, 1163-64 (1st Cir.1995). Thus, we calculate sixty-seven days that are undisputedly excludable under the Speedy Trial Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Hood argues that the Government uses \"pretext\" for the additional exclusions of time that they seek. More specifically, he adds that two periods of time are evidence of pretext: (1) the Government's attempted expansion of seven days (associated with Feldman-Rumpler's motion to withdraw) beyond the court's original exclusion of time, when the Government had agreed earlier that the additional time was not excludable, and (2) the time resulting from the court's unexplained cancellation of the pretrial conference.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have previously held that the Speedy Trial Act sets bright-line rules, and we will not distinguish between exclusions based on \"significant or complex `pretrial motions' and simple or routine motions.\" <i>Barnes,</i> 159 F.3d at 11. However, we have cautioned that \"neither counsel nor district courts may employ measures for excluding time from the speedy trial clock that impermissibly frustrate the [Speedy Trial Act]'s purpose of protecting the shared interest of criminal defendants and the public in `bringing criminal charges to the bar of justice as promptly as practicable.'\" <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> 421 F.3d 17, 29 (1st Cir. 2005); <i>see also United States v. Scott,</i> 270 F.3d 30, 54-57 (1st Cir.2001) (reversing on the basis of the district court's unauthorized late decisions on motions); <i>Staula,</i> 80 F.3d at 602 n. 3 (\"We will not permit either the district court or the prosecution to jerry-build a `hearing' in order to thwart the concinnous operation of the Speedy Trial Act.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Government sought, and the court granted, exclusion for April 13 &#8212; May 4, during which Feldman-Rumpler's motion to withdraw was pending. Hood argues that this period should not be excluded because Feldman-Rumpler's motion to withdraw did not actually delay the proceedings in the case. Hood points out that his new attorney, Mr. Lewin, had already begun participating in the trial before Feldman-Rumpler offered her motion to withdraw, and thus no delay resulted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We have stated that the pendency of a pretrial motion is excludable time regardless of its type or its actual effect on the trial. <i>See Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 63 F.3d at 1166 (\"[I]t is clear in this Circuit as in others that the exclusions of &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F) and (J) are `automatic,' and do not depend upon any showing of actual delay.\"); <i>see also United States v. Daychild,</i> 357 F.3d 1082, 1095 (9th Cir.2004) (excluding time during which a defense counsel's motion to withdraw was pending because \"the language of the statutory exclusion for delay . . . is unqualified as to the type of motion\"). Furthermore, we do not see any evidence that the motion to withdraw was part of a Government attempt to frustrate the operation of the Speedy Trial Act; to the contrary, the motion was filed by Hood's own attorney.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Thus, the district court did not err in excluding an additional seven days on account of Feldman-Rumpler's motion to withdraw.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, we add an additional seven excludable days to the sixty-seven undisputed excludable days, for a total of seventy-four excludable days. Subtracting seventy-four excludable days from 137 total days, we find that there could have been no more than sixty-three non-excludable days prior to Hood's motion to dismiss. Given that this falls well under the maximum of seventy non-excludable days permitted by the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161, we find that the district court properly denied Hood's motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. Because of this calculation, we do not need to address the defendant's argument about the cancellation of the pretrial conference. We wish, though, to discourage the cancellations of pretrial conference dates without setting new dates and without explanation. Such practices can create potential Speedy Trial Act problems, as this case illustrates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Apparently, Hood was not arrested at this time</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> This time period actually encompasses seven days, counting both April 22 and April 28.

Hood (\"Hood\") guilty of receipt of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252(a)(2) and possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252(a)(4)(B). Hood challenges his conviction on the ground that his rights under the Speedy Trial Act, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161 <i>et seq.,</i> were violated. After careful consideration, we affirm Hood's conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Facts</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2004, investigators from the United States Postal Service, armed with a search warrant, reviewed records of a credit card processor known to do business with a Russian child pornography distributor. Hood's name appeared in the processor's records. Postal investigators sent a letter to Hood soliciting an order for child pornography videotapes. Hood responded by mailing an order form and a money order for $125 to the postal investigators. When Hood arrived at the post office to collect his videotapes, he was detained by a postal investigator. After being read his <i>Miranda</i> rights, Hood admitted ordering the videotapes and further admitted possessing additional child pornography on his computer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Hood was indicted by a grand jury on March 16, 2005. On March 21, Hood was arrested; the district court appointed Leslie Feldman-Rumpler (\"Feldman-Rumpler\") as Hood's attorney and the Government moved for pretrial detention. Hood later obtained his own counsel, Robert D. Lewin, who entered an appearance on April 11. On April 12, the court held a detention hearing for Hood. On April 13, Feldman-Rumpler, Hood's court-appointed attorney, filed a motion to withdraw as counsel. The court held another detention hearing on April 21, during which the court granted the Government's motion for pretrial detention, but did not set the conditions of the detention. On April 29, Hood and the Government attended an initial status conference. On May 4, the court granted Feldman-Rumpler's motion to withdraw and entered an \"Order of Excludable Delay,\" stating that for purposes of the Speedy Trial Act, as of May 31, only \"six non-excludable days\" (April 22 &#8212; April 28) had passed since Hood's arrest.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 10, the court held a release hearing, during which it determined conditions for Hood's release from jail. On June 15, Hood and the Government filed a \"Final Status Conference Joint Memorandum\" representing that there were no discovery issues known or anticipated, no schedule needed to be set, a plea was unlikely, and the trial would take no more than four days. The order also represented that there were no periods of excludable delay other than those mentioned in the May 4 order. The court held the final status conference on June 16, and entered a \"Further Order of Excludable Delay,\" stating that as of June 16, twenty-one non-excludable days had passed since Hood's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 24, the court scheduled a status/pretrial conference for June 29. The court cancelled the conference on June 28. On July 12, the Government filed a motion for a new pretrial conference and to exclude time from June 29 until the new pretrial conference. On July 20, Hood agreed to the Government's proposed pretrial conference and filed his opposition to the motion to exclude time. On July 21, the court ordered a pretrial conference to be held on August 4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 4, at the pretrial conference, Hood filed a \"Motion to Dismiss the Indictment with Prejudice for Lack of a Speedy Trial.\" The Government filed two motions to exclude time from April 13 &#8212; May 4 and from July 12 &#8212; August 4. The court granted both of the Government's motions to exclude time and denied Hood's motion to dismiss. The court scheduled trial for August 22. Hood was tried and convicted of receipt of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252(a)(2) and possession of child pornography in violation of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2252(a)(4)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review \"the district court's denial of a motion to dismiss based upon the Speedy Trial Act <i>de novo</i> as to legal rulings and for clear error as to factual findings.\" <i>United States v.

The Speedy Trial Act requires that a court grant a defendant's motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial if the defendant is not brought to trial within seventy non-excludable days. 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 3161, 3162(a)(2).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing a claim under the Speedy Trial Act, we must first calculate \"the aggregate time elapsed awaiting trial.\" <i>United States v. Barnes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198181\"><a href=\"/opinion/198181/united-states-v-barnes/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">4</span></a></span>, 10 (1st Cir.1998) (quoting <i>United States v.

The speedy trial clock begins ticking on the day a defendant first appears in court and stops the day the defendant files a motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. <i>See Staula,</i> 80 F.3d at 600. Hood was arrested and first appeared in court on March 21; he filed his motion to dismiss on August 4. We thus calculate that a total of 137 days elapsed between Hood's arrest and his motion to dismiss.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, we determine how many days should be excluded under the Speedy Trial Act. <i>Barnes,</i> 159 F.3d at 10. Time may be excluded under the Speedy Trial Act for, <i>inter alia,</i> \"delay resulting from any pretrial motion, from the filing of the motion through the conclusion of the hearing on, or other prompt disposition of, such motion,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(F), and \"delay reasonably attributable to any period, not to exceed thirty days, during which any proceeding concerning the defendant is actually under advisement by the court,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3161(h)(1)(J). Hood does not challenge the orders of exclusion entered on May 4 and June 16, which provided for a total of sixty-six excludable days. Further, the day the motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial is filed is excludable as delay resulting from a pretrial motion. <i>United States v. Rodr&#237;guez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"702494\"><a href=\"/opinion/702494/united-states-v-geraldo-rodriguez-aka-jose-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1159</span></a></span>, 1163-64 (1st Cir.1995).
