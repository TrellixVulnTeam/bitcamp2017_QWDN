Demissie and Demissie & Associates on brief for\npetitioner.\n     Deborah N. Misir, Trial Attorney, United States Department of\nJustice, Civil Division, Office of Immigration Litigation, Peter D.\nKeisler, Assistant Attorney General, Civil Division, and Julia Doig\nWilcox, Senior Litigation Counsel, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n                          July 14, 2005\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.       The only question presented is\n\nwhether an immigrant charged with removal (based on overstaying a\n\nvisa and on marriage fraud) was denied due process when the\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) during the removal hearing inadvertently\n\nfailed to record testimony of two witnesses but then recreated a\n\nrecord of their testimony, with the assistance of counsel, from her\n\nnotes.    There was no denial of due process.       The petition for\n\nreview is denied.   The effect of this, inter alia, is that Ibe will\n\nbe deported and barred from being granted future visa applications.\n\n                                 I.\n\n           Bernard Chickwendu Ibe, a native and citizen of Nigeria,\n\nwas admitted into the United States on July 24, 1997, as a non-\n\nimmigrant visitor with permission to remain in the country for six\n\nmonths.   He remained longer than permitted.     On January 17, 2001,\n\nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)1 issued him a\n\nnotice of removability based on two grounds: his having overstayed\n\nhis visa, 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B), and his being an alien who\n\nsought    to   procure   an   immigration     benefit   by   willfully\n\nmisrepresenting a material fact through entering into a marriage\n\nfor the purpose of obtaining immigration benefits,           8 U.S.C.\n\n\n\n     1\n       On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist and its principal\nfunctions were transferred to the Bureau of Immigration and Customs\nEnforcement in the Department of Homeland Security. See Homeland\nSecurity Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, § 471, 116 Stat. 2135,\n2205 (codified as amended at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)). We refer to the\nagency as the INS throughout this opinion.\n\n                                 -2-\n\f§ 1227(a)(1)(A); 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(6)(C)(i).\n\n           At his initial removal hearing on May 1, 2001, Ibe\n\napplied for adjustment of status to that of lawful permanent\n\nresident based on his purported marriage to Tamar Ellis in 2000,\n\nand in the alternative for voluntary departure.               The IJ scheduled\n\na second removal hearing to adjudicate the marriage-fraud claim\n\n(for Ibe admitted he had overstayed his visa). Testimony was heard\n\non several days from July to September 2002.            Ibe testified, as did\n\nhis purported wife, Tamar Ellis, and two friends, Charles Iwejuo\n\nand   Stanley   Chukweuzi.      Iwejuo      and   Chukweuzi    also   submitted\n\naffidavits.     After the oral testimony of witnesses Iwejuo and\n\nChukweuzi, the IJ realized that she had accidentally forgotten to\n\ntape record their testimony (which was consistent with their\n\naffidavits), and from her notes and with help from counsel for both\n\nsides,   she    restated   on   the   record      the   substance     of   their\n\nstatements.\n\n           INS Special Agent Seth Plumb, the investigating officer\n\nfor Ibe's case, testified for the government. The government\n\nentered into evidence Ibe's wife's withdrawal of her I-130 petition\n\nfiled on Ibe's behalf.       The I-130 petition was a prerequisite to\n\nhis application for adjustment of status.           See 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a).\n\n           The IJ rendered a decision on February 3, 2003, finding\n\nthe defendant removable both because he had overstayed his visa and\n\nbecause he had entered into a marriage for the purpose of obtaining\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fan immigration benefit.      The IJ pretermitted Ibe's application for\n\nadjustment of status because, due to the withdrawal of the I-130\n\npetition, there was no approved visa petition for Ibe.             Based on\n\nthe marriage-fraud finding, the IJ held that Ibe was permanently\n\nbarred from being granted a visa petition in the future, pursuant\n\nto 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c)(1).          The IJ also denied Ibe voluntary\n\ndeparture because he had produced no evidence of a valid passport,\n\nand therefore was statutorily ineligible for that relief, and in\n\nthe   alternative   denied    voluntary   departure    as    a    matter   of\n\ndiscretion based on the marriage-fraud finding.\n\n           Ibe   appealed    the   IJ's   decision    to    the   Board    of\n\nImmigration Appeals (BIA), arguing, inter alia, that the failure to\n\ntape record the testimony of Iwejuo and Chukweuzi denied Ibe his\n\nright to a full and fair hearing.     On May 28, 2004, the BIA adopted\n\nand affirmed the decision of the IJ.         In addressing the claimed\n\nunfairness of Ibe's hearing, the BIA found:\n\n           [Ibe] has not demonstrated any deficiency by\n           the [IJ] in applying legal standards, in\n           evaluating the testimonial and documentary\n           evidence presented, or otherwise in conducting\n           [her] hearings.     Moreover, [Ibe] has not\n           demonstrated any resultant prejudice such as\n           would constitute a due process violation,\n           particularly in view of his failure to\n           establish eligibility for relief from removal.\n\nIbe timely petitioned for review of the BIA's decision.2\n\n\n      2\n       Alberto Gonzales was sworn in as Attorney General of the\nUnited States on February 3, 2005. We have substituted him for\nJohn  Ashcroft,   previous  holder  of  that   office,  as  the\n\n                                   -4-\n\f                                      II.\n\n            On appeal, Ibe argues that the BIA's affirmance of the\n\nIJ's decision without the full recorded testimony of Iwejuo and\n\nChukweuzi     denied   him    his    right     to     a    full     and    complete\n\nadministrative    review     and    violated    his       due   process    rights.\n\nSee Laurent v. Ashcroft, 359 F.3d 59, 62 (1st Cir. 2004).                        Our\n\nreview of whether the IJ's actions violated Ibe's due process\n\nrights is de novo.     Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 568 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n            We reject Ibe's argument.          True, the IJ has a \"duty to\n\nprepare a reasonably accurate, reasonably complete transcript,\"\n\nOrtiz-Salas v. INS, 992 F.2d 105, 106 (7th Cir. 1992); see 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1240.47.    That duty was met here.        After the accidental failure\n\nto record the testimony of two witnesses, the IJ created a record\n\nof their testimony from her notes and their written statements with\n\nassistance from both counsel and without objection.                 This does not\n\nrise to the level of a due process violation.               Ibe offers nothing\n\nindicating that the record, as recreated, is inaccurate.\n\n            Further,   Ibe   has    failed   even     to    argue   that    he   was\n\nprejudiced by the error here, an essential requirement of a due\n\nprocess claim.    See Ortiz-Salas, 992 F.2d at 106.               There could be\n\nno prejudice as to Ibe's principal claim for adjustment of status,\n\nbecause the IJ was correct in holding that he lacked the statutory\n\n\nrespondent.    See Fed. R. App. P. 43(c)(2).\n\n                                      -5-\n\fpredicate for that relief due to his wife's withdrawal of her I-130\n\npetition on his behalf.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a).\n\n            The only effect of the marriage-fraud finding (the only\n\nissue as to which Iwejuo's and Chukweuzi's testimony was relevant)\n\nwas the holding that Ibe would be barred from applying for a visa\n\nin the future, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c)(1).                    Given Ibe's\n\ncounsel's   admission   that    the    content     of    the   two    witnesses'\n\ntestimony   would   provide    nothing      more   than    existed     in   their\n\naffidavits, which are a part of the record, there could be no\n\nserious claim of prejudice on this issue.               We also find that the\n\nBIA's affirmance based on this record neither violated Ibe's\n\nstatutory right to administrative review nor his right to due\n\nprocess.\n\n            We affirm the decision of the BIA and deny the petition\n\nfor judicial review.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f",

After the oral testimony of witnesses Iwejuo and Chukweuzi, the IJ realized that she had accidentally forgotten to tape record their testimony (which was consistent with their affidavits), and from her notes and with help from counsel for both sides, she restated on the record the substance of their statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">INS Special Agent Seth Plumb, the investigating officer for Ibe's case, testified for the government. The government entered into evidence Ibe's wife's withdrawal of her I-130 petition filed on Ibe's behalf. The I-130 petition was a prerequisite to his application for adjustment of status. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ rendered a decision on February 3, 2003, finding the defendant removable both because he had overstayed his visa and because he had entered into a marriage for the purpose of obtaining an immigration benefit. The IJ pretermitted Ibe's application for adjustment of status because, due to the withdrawal of the I-130 petition, there was no approved visa petition for Ibe. Based on the marriage-fraud finding, the IJ held that Ibe was permanently barred from being granted a visa petition in the future, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1154(c)(1). The IJ also denied Ibe voluntary departure because he had produced no evidence of a valid passport, and therefore was statutorily ineligible for that relief, and in the alternative denied voluntary departure as a matter of discretion based on the marriage-fraud finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ibe appealed the IJ's decision to the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA), arguing, inter alia, that the failure to tape record the testimony of Iwejuo and Chukweuzi denied Ibe his right to a full and fair hearing. On May 28, 2004, the BIA adopted and affirmed the decision of the IJ. In addressing the claimed unfairness of Ibe's hearing, the BIA found:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[Ibe] has not demonstrated any deficiency by the [IJ] in applying legal standards, in evaluating the testimonial and documentary evidence presented, or otherwise in conducting [her] hearings. Moreover, [Ibe] has not demonstrated any resultant prejudice such as would constitute a due process violation, particularly in view of his failure to establish eligibility for relief from removal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ibe timely petitioned for review of the BIA's decision.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Ibe argues that the BIA's affirmance of the IJ's decision without the full <i>recorded</i> testimony of Iwejuo and Chukweuzi denied him his right to a full and complete administrative review and violated his due process rights. <i>See Laurent v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200882\"><a href=\"/opinion/200882/laurent-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">59</span></a></span>, 62 (1st Cir.2004). Our review of whether the IJ's actions violated Ibe's due process rights is de novo. <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 568 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject Ibe's argument. True, the IJ has a \"duty to prepare a reasonably accurate, reasonably complete transcript,\" <i>Ortiz-Salas v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"605629\"><a href=\"/opinion/605629/jose-ortiz-salas-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">992</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 106 (7th Cir.1993); <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1240.47. That duty was met here. After the accidental failure to record the testimony of two witnesses, the IJ created a record of their testimony from her notes and their written statements with assistance from both counsel and without objection. This does not rise to the level of a due process violation. Ibe offers nothing indicating that the record, as recreated, is inaccurate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Further, Ibe has failed even to argue that he was prejudiced by the error here, an essential requirement of a due process claim. <i>See Ortiz-Salas,</i> 992 F.2d at 106. There could be no prejudice as to Ibe's principal claim for adjustment of status, because the IJ was correct in holding that he lacked the statutory predicate for that relief due to his wife's withdrawal of her I-130 petition on his behalf. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1255(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only effect of the marriage-fraud finding (the only issue as to which Iwejuo's and Chukweuzi's testimony was relevant) was the holding that Ibe would be barred from applying for a visa in the future, pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1154(c)(1). Given Ibe's counsel's admission that the content of the two witnesses' testimony would provide nothing more than existed in their affidavits, which are a part of the record, there could be no serious claim of prejudice on this issue. We also find that the BIA's affirmance based on this record neither violated Ibe's statutory right to administrative review nor his right to due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>affirm</i> the decision of the BIA and deny the petition for judicial review.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist and its principal functions were transferred to the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement in the Department of Homeland Security<i>See</i> Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L.
