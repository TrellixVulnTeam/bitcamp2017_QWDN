Richard G. Stearns, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                   Before\n\n                       Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                    Stahl, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                      and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Mary Ann Hickey on brief pro se.\n     James L. Wilkinson and Murray, Kelly & Bertrand, P.C., on\nbrief for appellee MetroWest Medical Center.\n     Douglas A. Morgan, Holly L. Parks and Rindler Morgan, P.C., on\nbrief for appellee Stephen Kruskall, M.D.\n     Richard W. Jensen and Morrison Mahoney LLP, on brief for\nappellee Constance A. Collins, M.D.\n\f                                          July 19, 2006\n\n\n               Per Curiam.           Mary Ann Hickey has appealed the dismissal\n\nof her complaint.1             We affirm.\n\n               Contrary to Hickey's contention, the district court did\n\nnot err in granting the motion to dismiss filed by the defendant\n\nMetroWest Medical Center (\"the Hospital\") on the ground that Hickey\n\nhad failed to allege any viable federal claim or alternate basis\n\nfor federal jurisdiction. On appeal, Hickey raises a procedurally-\n\nbased argument by pointing to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(g), which provides\n\nthat a defense is waived if not included in any first motion filed\n\nunder       Rule    12.        She   notes    that   the   Hospital    had   previously\n\nunsuccessfully            moved      to   dismiss    for   insufficient      service   of\n\nprocess.       Although the successful motion to dismiss was the second\n\nmotion to dismiss filed by the Hospital, Rule 12(h) provides\n\nexceptions to waiver for the defense of failure to state a claim,\n\nsee   Fed.         R.   Civ.    P.    12(h)(2),      and   lack   of   subject   matter\n\njurisdiction, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). Accordingly, there was\n\nno error.\n\n\n\n\n        1\n      Hickey filed two notices of appeal. Appeal No. 04-2461 is\nfrom a September 16, 2004 Order dismissing claims against two named\ndefendants.   Appeal No. 04-2462 is from the September 21, 2004\nOrder dismissing the entire case. Nothing turns on the distinction\nbetween the two appeals.\n\n                                               -2-\n\f             Hickey makes no substantial argument that the district\n\ncourt erred in finding that the Hospital was not a state actor and\n\nthat ruling appears to us to be clearly correct.                        Therefore,\n\nessentially for the reasons stated in the district court's Order of\n\nNovember 6, 2003, we affirm the dismissal of the federal claims\n\nagainst the Hospital and the dismissal of the state law claims\n\nagainst that entity without prejudice.\n\n             To the extent that Hickey purports to raise federal civil\n\nrights claims against Dr. Collins and Dr. Kruskall, those claims\n\nare fatally deficient for the same reason.                  Neither physician is a\n\nstate actor. The district court did not dismiss Hickey's complaint\n\nagainst these defendants on this ground, however.                     Instead, the\n\ndistrict     court    concluded   that      any      fair   reading   of    Hickey's\n\ncomplaint     makes    clear   that   she      was    challenging     the   medical\n\ntreatment she did or did not receive from Dr. Collins and Dr.\n\nKruskall. We agree with this assessment. Notwithstanding Hickey's\n\nlabeling of her claims, she was challenging medical judgments.\n\n             Thereafter, the district court referred the matter to the\n\nstate court for the convening of a medical malpractice tribunal.\n\nThis referral was in error. Once the district court concluded that\n\nall   that    Hickey    raised    were    essentially         state   law   medical\n\nmalpractice claims against these defendants (and no other basis for\n\nfederal jurisdiction was apparent), it should have dismissed the\n\ncomplaint against them for lack of jurisdiction.                 See Pallazola v.\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fRucker, 797 F.2d 1116, 1127-28 (1st Cir. 1986) (in the absence of\n\nsubject matter jurisdiction, the court was required to dismiss on\n\njurisdictional grounds); cf. Feinstein v. Massachusetts Gen. Hosp.,\n\n643 F.2d 880 (1st Cir. 1981) (a Massachusetts diversity-based\n\nmedical malpractice action filed in federal court must follow the\n\nstate's statutory provision requiring a pre-screening by a medical\n\nmalpractice tribunal).        We, therefore, do not reach Hickey's\n\nargument that the district court erred in dismissing her claims for\n\nfailure to post the required bond after the tribunal found in the\n\ndefendants' favor. To the extent that Hickey's remaining arguments\n\nof error by the district court -- the denial of appointed counsel,\n\nleave to amend, and discovery -- are not mooted, they are rejected\n\nas unpersuasive.\n\n          Accordingly, we affirm, in all respects, the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of the claims against the Hospital.           Although we\n\nalso affirm the dismissal of the claims against Dr. Collins and Dr.\n\nKruskall, we do so on the ground that no viable federal claim was\n\npresented and, to the extent that state law based claims were\n\npresented,   those   claims   are   properly   dismissed   for     lack   of\n\njurisdiction.   As is the case with the Hospital, the dismissal of\n\nthe state law claims against the defendant physicians is without\n\nprejudice.      Whether   that   qualification    makes    an    effective\n\ndistinction in these circumstances is unclear since the convening\n\nof a medical malpractice tribunal would have resulted even if the\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fstate law claims against Dr. Collins and Dr. Kruskall had been\n\ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction by the district court and then\n\nreinstituted in the state court.          We offer no speculation as to\n\nwhether a state court would now conclude that Hickey is precluded\n\nfrom presenting her claims at a second tribunal.\n\n          The Order of Dismissal entered on September 21, 2004,\n\ndismissing   the   complaint   in   its   entirety,   is   affirmed.   The\n\ndismissal with respect to Dr. Collins and Dr. Kruskall shall\n\nreflect that dismissal is grounded on lack of jurisdiction and, to\n\nthe extent that state law claims are presented, those claims are\n\ndismissed without prejudice.\n\n          So Ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",
