SULLIVAN and the CITY OF LAWRENCE,\n\n                     Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n          [Hon. William G. Young, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                    Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                 Campbell, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Walter H. Underhill, on brief for appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                        January 18, 2008\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.                 Michael Gagliardi lost his\n\nposition    on    the     Merrimack       Valley     Workforce       Investment    Board\n\n(\"Board\") in Lawrence, Massachusetts, when the Board was dissolved\n\nfor failure to achieve the required state certification.                             He\n\nbrought    suit    under       42   U.S.C.    §    1983,1    claiming    that   Michael\n\nSullivan, Lawrence's mayor (\"Mayor Sullivan\"), along with the City\n\nof   Lawrence     itself       (\"City\")      and   three     state    officials,   were\n\nresponsible       for    the    Board's       dissolution      and    his   consequent\n\ndismissal, and that such conduct amounted to a violation of his\n\nFirst and Fourteenth Amendment rights.                   The three state officials\n\nmoved to dismiss Gagliardi's claim for failure to state a claim on\n\nwhich relief could be granted, see Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and\n\nthe district court granted the motion with respect to all five\n\ndefendants.        Gagliardi appeals this dismissal, but only with\n\nrespect    to     Mayor     Sullivan         and   the      City.       After   careful\n\nconsideration, we affirm.\n\n                                    I.    Background\n\n            A.    Facts\n\n            Since the district court dismissed Gagliardi's complaint\n\npursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), we assume the truth of the well-pleaded\n\nfacts therein.          Martínez-Rivera v. Sánchez-Ramos, 498 F.3d 3, 5\n\n(1st Cir. 2007); see also Ruiz v. Bally Total Fitness Holding\n\n\n\n1\n   Gagliardi also made a state law claim that is not at issue in\nthis appeal.\n\n                                             -2-\n\fCorp., 496 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007).                 We draw our recounting of\n\nthe relevant facts from the complaint and the documents annexed to\n\nit or fairly incorporated within it.                 See Wetmore v. MacDonald,\n\nPage, Schatz, Fletcher & Co., LLC, 476 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n            The     Board    was     a   nonprofit     corporation       established\n\npursuant to the Workforce Investment Act §§ 101-195, 29 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 2801-2945 (2007).              Its duties included determining how to\n\nallocate federal, state, and local funds to occupational training\n\nin Lawrence and surrounding communities, establishing workforce\n\ndevelopment policy, and assisting in overseeing two \"one-stop\n\ncareer centers\" in the Lawrence area.               During the relevant period,\n\nMayor Sullivan served as the Board's Chief Elected Official. Among\n\nMayor Sullivan's duties as Chief Elected Official was to appoint\n\nmembers to the Board.         See id. § 2832(c)(1)(A).\n\n            The Workforce Investment Act requires that local boards\n\nbe certified by the governor of the state every two years, based on\n\ncertain specified criteria.                See id. § 2832(c)(2).            During the\n\nrelevant period, then-Governor Mitt Romney (\"Governor Romney\")\n\ndelegated     responsibility         for    certifying       workforce      investment\n\nboards, along with receiving and evaluating certification-related\n\ndocuments,    to    the     Massachusetts         Division    of   Career     Services\n\n(\"DCS\"), headed by Susan V. Lawler (\"Commissioner Lawler\").                        DCS\n\nwas   a   subunit    of     the    Massachusetts      Department       of    Workforce\n\nDevelopment       (\"DWD\"),        headed     by    Ranch     Kimball     (\"Secretary\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fKimball\").2 DCS conditionally certified Gagliardi's Board sometime\n\nin 2004 pending the fulfillment of certain criteria.\n\n           At a certain point, the Board became concerned with the\n\nway Mayor Sullivan was using grant money subject to the Board's\n\njurisdiction.    It set up a task force, which in the summer of 20053\n\nuncovered a covert fund of some $1.1 million which Mayor Sullivan\n\nwas using for his own purposes.         The Board produced a report\n\nexposing the existence of the fund and criticizing Mayor Sullivan's\n\nuse of Board funds in general.\n\n           In the meantime, the Board was having problems obtaining\n\nits   biennial   certification   from   DCS.   It   had   submitted   a\n\ncertification package sometime in 2004, but DCS stated that it\n\nwould not certify the Board until Mayor Sullivan had completed\n\ncertain tasks,4 which he failed to do throughout 2005.      DCS cited\n\n\n\n2\n  Governor Romney, Secretary Kimball, and Commissioner Lawler were\noriginally named as defendants in this lawsuit along with Mayor\nSullivan and the City.\n3\n   Gagliardi omits to state in his complaint or brief the date on\nwhich the report was issued. We glean the fact that it was issued\nsometime in the summer of 2005 from the September 13, 2005\nnewspaper article on this incident, which Gagliardi attached to his\ncomplaint.\n4\n    A city department known as the Division of Training and\nDevelopment (\"DTD\") assisted in the operation of the two Lawrence-\narea career centers, and was originally also the employer of record\nof the Board members, \"Title I administrator,\" and fiscal agent.\nThe Board complained to DCS that state policy forbade the DTD from\nperforming these latter functions, and it was agreed that they\nwould be transferred to another entity. As Chief Elected Official,\nthis responsibility fell to Mayor Sullivan.\n\n                                  -4-\n\fthis    failure      as   a    reason      for     its    inability   to     grant   full\n\ncertification to the Board.\n\n             In September 2005, the City acknowledged that the Board\n\nhad compiled all the certification documents \"within its purview,\"\n\nbut that \"there [were] a few items that remain[ed] which [were]\n\ndependent     on   City       of   Lawrence      Decisions.\"        Soon     thereafter,\n\nGagliardi and the Board's chair disclosed Mayor Sullivan's inaction\n\nto a local newspaper, which published an article on the matter on\n\nSeptember 13, 2005.                According to Gagliardi's complaint, this\n\npublicity infuriated Mayor Sullivan's brother, Kevin Sullivan, who\n\npurportedly threatened to use his \"influence with the state\" to\n\ncause the Board to be decertified.\n\n             On October 21, 2005, Commissioner Lawler informed the\n\nBoard that, due to its continued conditionally certified status, it\n\nwas    no   longer    authorized        to    undertake      workforce       development\n\nbusiness, and would be confined to whatever business was necessary\n\nto rectify outstanding certification issues.                       Mayor Sullivan put\n\nattorney William DiAdamo in charge of compiling and presenting a\n\nfinal certification package to DCS.                      Apparently as part of this\n\npackage, DiAdamo drafted a new set of Board bylaws which, inter\n\nalia, would give Mayor Sullivan the power to dismiss board members\n\nat will.     The Board chair refused to go along with the termination\n\nprovision,     claiming        it    was     inconsistent      with    the    Workforce\n\nInvestment    Act.        Gagliardi        claims    that,    in   response     to   this\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\frefusal, DiAdamo's father \"said he had powerful allies in . . .\n\nRanch Kimball's office, who would decertify the [Board] on a\n\nmoment's notice.\"\n\n           According to the complaint, at some point in November\n\n2005, Mayor Sullivan met \"at a secret location with four DCS and/or\n\nDWD officials.\"      At the end of the meeting, \"the Mayor announced\n\nthat he had disbanded the Board.\"            Mayor Sullivan and DCS took the\n\nposition that the Board had to be dissolved because of its failure\n\nto submit a complete certification package, and Mayor Sullivan\n\nexpressed the view that conflicts among the Board's members had\n\nprevented it from functioning effectively.\n\n           B.     Procedure in the District Court\n\n           On March 28, 2006, Gagliardi filed suit in the district\n\ncourt under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming that Mayor Sullivan, the\n\nCity, Commissioner Lawler, Secretary Kimball, and Governor Romney\n\nhad   infringed    his   constitutional        rights   to   free   speech   and\n\nprocedural due process.      He averred, inter alia, that \"[t]he Board\n\nmembers were fired for performing an oversight function required by\n\nfederal law,\" and that Mayor Sullivan and DCS conspired to destroy\n\nthe Board by interfering with the certification process. Gagliardi\n\nsought, inter alia, a declaration that the termination of the Board\n\nwas unlawful, an injunction reinstating the Board and requiring\n\nMayor   Sullivan    to   assist   it   in     achieving   certification,     and\n\ncompensatory and punitive damages.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f            Governor Romney, Secretary Kimball, and Commissioner\n\nLawler moved jointly under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss Gagliardi's\n\ncomplaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be\n\ngranted.    Neither Mayor Sullivan nor the City joined the motion.\n\nAt   the   hearing   on   the   motion,    counsel   for   Governor   Romney,\n\nSecretary Kimball, and Commissioner Lawler presented arguments, as\n\ndid counsel for Gagliardi; counsel for Mayor Sullivan and the City\n\nwas in attendance, but made no submissions and acknowledged that he\n\nwas \"not obviously participating substantively in the discussions\n\n. . . .\"    The district court dismissed all of Gagliardi's federal\n\nclaims -- not only against Governor Romney, Secretary Kimball, and\n\nCommissioner Lawler, but also against Mayor Sullivan and the City\n\n-- and remanded the state claims to Massachusetts court.5\n\n            C.   Procedure on Appeal\n\n            Gagliardi appealed the dismissal of his complaint, only\n\nwith respect to Mayor Sullivan, the City, and Commissioner Lawler.\n\nCommissioner Lawler filed a response brief; Mayor Sullivan and the\n\nCity did not, and did not appear for oral argument.             Before oral\n\nargument, Commissioner Lawler and Gagliardi moved pursuant to\n\n\n\n\n5\n   By agreement among the parties, all claims against Governor\nRomney were dismissed, as were all claims against all defendants in\ntheir official capacities for compensatory and punitive damages.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b) to dismiss the appeal\n\nwith respect to her.    We granted the motion.6\n\n                           II.   Discussion\n\n           A.   Standard of Review\n\n           To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a\n\nclaim under Rule 12(b)(6), the factual allegations in a complaint\n\nmust \"possess enough heft\" to set forth \"a plausible entitlement to\n\nrelief.\"    Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, 127 S. Ct. 1955, 1966-67\n\n(2007).    Dismissal for failure to state a claim is appropriate if\n\nthe complaint fails to set forth \"'factual allegations, either\n\ndirect or inferential, respecting each material element necessary\n\nto sustain recovery under some actionable legal theory.'\"   Centro\n\nMédico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio, 406 F.3d 1, 6 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (quoting Berner v. Delahanty, 129 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)).\n\n           We review a district court's order granting a motion to\n\ndismiss de novo.     Id. at 5.   Although we take the well-pleaded\n\n\n\n6\n  After Commissioner Lawler was dismissed, Mayor Sullivan and the\nCity filed a letter stating that they \"formally adopt\" the\narguments made in Commissioner Lawler's brief \"as their own.\" An\nappellee cannot, however, simply adopt the arguments of another\nappellee without making some effort at explaining how those\narguments apply to its case, particularly in the present\ncircumstances where Commissioner Lawler's position and alleged\nconduct differ in several important respects from those of Mayor\nSullivan. See United States v. Casas, 425 F.3d 23, 30 n.2 (2005).\nWe decline the invitation to scour Commissioner Lawler's brief in\nsearch of arguments that might be availing to Mayor Sullivan and\nthe City. See id., 425 F.3d at 30 n.2.\n\n                                  -8-\n\ffacts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and indulge him\n\nall reasonable inferences,             Berner, 129 F.3d at 23, we need not\n\ncredit       \"bald        assertions,        periphrastic       circumlocutions,\n\nunsubstantiated        conclusions,         or    outright    vituperation,\"     or\n\n\"subjective        characterizations,            optimistic    predictions,      or\n\nproblematic suppositions.\" Wash. Legal Found. v. Mass. Bar Found.,\n\n993 F.2d 962, 971 (1st Cir. 1993) (citation and internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted); accord Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth Coll., 889\n\nF.2d   13,   16    (1st     Cir.   1989),    overruled   on    other   grounds   by\n\nEducadores Puertorriqueños en Acción v. Hernández, 367 F.3d 61 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).       We may augment the facts in the complaint by reference\n\nto \"(i) documents annexed to [the complaint] or fairly incorporated\n\ninto   it,   and     (ii)    matters    susceptible      to   judicial   notice.\"\n\nNisselson v. Lernout, 469 F.3d 143, 150 (1st Cir. 2006).7\n\n\n\n\n7\n  Gagliardi may have been entitled to different treatment because,\nwhile he was clearly on notice that the district court might grant\nthe Rule 12(b)(6) motion with respect to its proponents Romney,\nKimball, and Lawler, he may not have been on notice that the\ndistrict court would also dismiss the complaint with respect to\nSullivan and the City. As discussed above, Sullivan and the City\ndid not join the motion or make arguments at the motion hearing.\nSee Chute v. Walker, 281 F.3d 314, 319 (1st Cir. 2002) (sua sponte\ndismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) upheld only if \"[i]f it is crystal\nclear that the plaintiff cannot prevail and that amending the\ncomplaint would be futile\") (quoting González-González v. United\nStates, 257 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir. 2001)). Nevertheless, Gagliardi\ndid not object at the hearing and has not raised this issue on\nappeal, so we apply the normal standard. See Zannino, 895 F.2d at\n17.\n\n                                         -9-\n\f             B.    42 U.S.C. § 1983\n\n             Section 1983 is a vehicle through which individuals may\n\nsue certain persons for depriving them of federally assured rights,\n\nsuch   as    the    First   Amendment's        right   to   free        speech   or   the\n\nFourteenth Amendment's right to procedural due process. See Centro\n\nMédico del Turabo, 406 F.3d at 6 n.2.             A claim under § 1983 has two\n\n\"essential elements\": the defendant must have acted under color of\n\nstate law, and his or her conduct must have deprived the plaintiff\n\nof   rights       secured   by    the    Constitution       or     by    federal      law.\n\nRodríguez-Cirilo v. García, 115 F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir. 1997).                          The\n\nsecond      element    requires        the    plaintiff     to     show     \"that     the\n\n[defendant's]       conduct      was    the   cause    in   fact    of    the    alleged\n\ndeprivation.\"       Id.\n\n                       1.   Free Speech Claim\n\n             Claims of retaliatory adverse employment action for the\n\nexercise of First Amendment rights are cognizable under § 1983.\n\nSee Powell v. Alexander, 391 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir. 2004).                         To make\n\nout such a claim in the present circumstances, the well-pleaded\n\nfacts in the complaint, considered together with the documents\n\nannexed to it or fairly incorporated within it, must establish that\n\nGagliardi's speech was protected under the First Amendment so as to\n\nshield him from adverse employment action in retaliation for such\n\n\n\n\n                                          -10-\n\fspeech,8 and that he suffered adverse employment action caused by\n\nMayor Sullivan and the City.         In addition, there is a third\n\nquestion concerned with causation, \"with whether the plaintiff can\n\nshow that the protected expression was a substantial or motivating\n\nfactor in the adverse employment decision.\" Curran v. Cousins, No.\n\n07-1686, 2007 WL 4247791, at *6 (1st Cir. Dec. 5, 2007).9           The\n\nemployer must, of course, \"have the opportunity to prove that it\n\nwould have made the same decision regardless of the protected\n\nexpression.\"   Id. (citing Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ.\n\nv. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977)).\n\n           Read in the light most favorable to Gagliardi and drawing\n\nall reasonable inferences in his favor, the complaint cites two\n\nconcrete   instances   of   speech   which   allegedly   provoked   the\n\nretaliatory dissolution of the Board.    The first was in the summer\n\n\n\n8\n   Whether a public employee is shielded from adverse employment\naction for engaging in speech is governed by a two-step inquiry\nthat asks \"'whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of\npublic concern'\" and, if so, \"'whether the relevant government\nentity had an adequate justification for treating the employee\ndifferently from any other member of the general public.'\" Curran\nv. Cousins, No. 07-1686, 2007 WL 4247791, at *6 (1st Cir. Dec. 5,\n2007) (quoting Garcetti v. Ceballos, 126 S. Ct. 1951, 1958 (2006)).\nThese are issues of law for the court. As discussed below, the\nthird issue is causation.\n9\n   As a general rule, we abstain at this stage of the proceedings\nfrom deciding whether this element has been established, since it\n\"'normally presents a factfinding responsibility for the jury.'\"\nGarnier v. Rodríguez, 506 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting\nNethersole v. Bulger, 287 F.3d 15, 18-19 (1st Cir. 2002)). In this\ncase we are presented with a rare exception to the general rule, as\nthe complaint is so patently deficient.\n\n                                 -11-\n\fof 2005, when the Board issued its report exposing the existence of\n\nMayor Sullivan's $1.1 million covert fund.           The second was the\n\nSeptember 13, 2005 newspaper article in which Gagliardi and the\n\nchair of the Board exposed Mayor Sullivan's persistent failure to\n\nperform   the   tasks   necessary    for   the   Board   to   complete   its\n\ncertification package.     Neither allegation is sufficient to state\n\na claim on which relief can be granted.\n\n            First, it is evident that neither Mayor Sullivan nor\n\nanyone else whose conduct may be imputed to the City was directly\n\nresponsible for decertifying, and thus dissolving, the Board.\n\nDespite the occasional asseveration that Mayor Sullivan himself\n\n\"fired,\" \"terminated,\" or \"disbanded\" the Board -- and thus \"fired\"\n\nor \"terminated\" its members -- it is clear that only the governor\n\nand those acting with authority delegated by him were empowered to\n\ncertify or decertify workforce investment boards.             See 29 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2832(c).      Nowhere does Gagliardi allege that Governor Romney\n\ndelegated this authority to Mayor Sullivan or another Lawrence city\n\nofficial.    He instead admits that Governor Romney delegated it to\n\nDCS, and that it was Commissioner Lawler as head of DCS who oversaw\n\nthe certification process, including by corresponding with the\n\nBoard on the steps still needed to achieve certification, and by\n\nultimately deciding that the Board could transact no further\n\nworkforce development business until it submitted a complete and\n\nsatisfactory certification package.         According to the complaint,\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fMayor Sullivan did not announce the Board's dissolution until after\n\nhe had met in secret with unnamed officials from DCS or from DWD,\n\nthe   state    agency   of   which    DCS    formed   part.    We   reject   the\n\ncomplaint's intimation that Mayor Sullivan somehow twisted the arm\n\nof these officials, during this meeting or elsewhere, to persuade\n\nthem to decertify the Board; this allegation is conclusory and is\n\nnot substantiated by reasonable inference from the well-pleaded\n\nfacts.     See Dartmouth Review, 889 F.2d at 16.10            The well-pleaded\n\nfacts do not demonstrate that either Mayor Sullivan or any other\n\nLawrence    city   official    made    or    directly   compelled   the   state\n\nofficials to make the decision to decertify.\n\n              Second, Gagliardi's complaint, viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to him, can also be read as making an allegation of\n\nindirect causation between Mayor Sullivan and the decision to\n\ndecertify.      The Board was decertified for failing to submit a\n\ncomplete certification package.             While the Board had, sometime in\n\n2004, turned in all the required documentation it could to DCS, it\n\nfell to Mayor Sullivan as Chief Elected Official to undertake the\n\nremaining tasks necessary for certification. Gagliardi argues that\n\n\n\n10\n   We similarly give no credit to any notion that Kevin Sullivan,\nMayor Sullivan's brother, carried out his threat to use his\n\"influence with the state\" to cause the Board to be decertified in\nretaliation for the newspaper article, or that DiAdamo's father\ncarried out his threat to contact \"powerful allies in . . . Ranch\nKimball's office, who would decertify the [Board] on a moment's\nnotice.\" In any event, the complaint does not allege that either\nman actually approached any state official to urge decertification.\n\n                                      -13-\n\fMayor Sullivan deliberately refrained from undertaking these tasks\n\nin retaliation for the critical report, the newspaper article, or\n\nboth.\n\n               Yet even if Gagliardi could manage to prove at trial a\n\ncausal nexus between Mayor Sullivan's deliberate inaction and the\n\ndecision to decertify the Board -- including that DCS would have\n\ncertified the Board but for Mayor Sullivan's inaction -- he has\n\nfailed    to    demonstrate    that     either    instance      of    speech    was   a\n\nsubstantial      or   motivating      factor     behind   the    inaction.        The\n\ncomplaint avers that the certification package was ready, with the\n\nexception of the tasks required of Mayor Sullivan, sometime in\n\n2004.    According to the complaint, \"[t]hroughout 2005, the Mayor,\n\nthrough his inaction, prevented the certification process from\n\nbeing    completed.\"      These       facts    plainly    indicate      that    Mayor\n\nSullivan's inaction began at least some months before the two\n\ninstances of speech, which occurred respectively in the summer of\n\n2005 and on September 13, 2005.               The speech in question did not\n\nprovoke    Mayor      Sullivan     to     abstain     from      undertaking       his\n\ncertification-related tasks; such abstention long predated the\n\nspeech    and      continued     up     to     the   Board's         November    2005\n\ndecertification.       See Johnson v. Louisiana, 369 F.3d 826, 830 (5th\n\nCir. 2004) (\"[I]f the decision-maker who imposed the adverse\n\nemployment action was not motivated by the speech, then the speech\n\ndid not cause the adverse employment action.\").                  Even if a causal\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\flink could be demonstrated between Mayor Sullivan's inaction and\n\nthe decision to decertify the Board, Gagliardi has failed to plead\n\nsufficient facts to show that his speech was a substantial or\n\nmotivating factor behind Mayor Sullivan's inaction.\n\n            Accordingly, Gagliardi has failed to state a plausible\n\nentitlement to relief on the free speech claim:             he has not alleged\n\nsufficient well-pleaded facts to demonstrate that Mayor Sullivan or\n\nthe City directly caused the Board's decertification or that, if\n\nMayor Sullivan indirectly caused the decertification through his\n\ninaction,   that    the    speech   in    question   was    a   substantial     or\n\nmotivating factor behind such inaction.           No relief could therefore\n\nbe granted on this claim if the case were to proceed to trial.\n\n                     2.    Due Process Claim\n\n            What    we    have   said    above   allows    us   to   dispose    of\n\nGagliardi's Fourteenth Amendment due process claim in short order.\n\nInvoking Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill, 470 U.S. 532 (1985),\n\nGagliardi argues that he had a property interest in his position on\n\nthe Board, and that he was deprived of this interest without due\n\nprocess of law by not being told the reasons for the Board's\n\ndissolution   and    his    consequent     dismissal,      or   being   given   an\n\nopportunity to be heard.         See Alvarado-Aguilera v. Negrón, No. 06-\n\n2467, 2007 WL 4247665, at *1 (1st Cir. Dec. 5, 2007) (plaintiff\n\nmust \"'exhibit a constitutionally protected interest in life,\n\nliberty, or property'\" to state a valid claim for a violation of\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fFourteenth Amendment due process (quoting Centro Médico del Turabo,\n\n406 F.3d at 8)); id.

We need not reach the question of whether Massachusetts\n\nlaw gave Gagliardi a property interest in continued appointment to\n\nthe Board because he cannot make out a due process claim even if he\n\ncan show such an interest.         This is so because neither Mayor\n\nSullivan nor any other Lawrence official was responsible for the\n\ndecision to decertify the Board, and they accordingly had no duty\n\nto provide Gagliardi with notice or an opportunity to be heard.           If\n\nanyone owed Gagliardi such guarantees -- again, a question we do\n\nnot reach -- it would have been Governor Romney, Secretary Kimball,\n\nCommissioner Lawler, or some other state official with the proper\n\nauthorization; none of these persons is a party to the lawsuit.\n\nCf. Woods v. City of Michigan City, Ind., 940 F.2d 275, 279 (7th\n\nCir. 1991) (defendants city and county not liable under § 1983\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fwhere   official   whose   order    arguably    deprived   plaintiff   of\n\nconstitutionally protected liberty interest without due process was\n\na non-defendant state judge).      Thus, Gagliardi has again failed to\n\nstate a plausible entitlement to relief.        The district court did\n\nnot err in dismissing this claim under Rule 12(b)(6).\n\n                           III.    Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the dismissal of\n\nGagliardi's complaint.     No costs are awarded.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f",

He brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,<sup>[1]</sup> claiming that Michael Sullivan, Lawrence's mayor (\"Mayor Sullivan\"), along with the. City of Lawrence itself (\"City\") and three state officials, were responsible for the Board's dissolution and his consequent dismissal, and that such conduct amounted to a violation of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The three state officials moved to dismiss Gagliardi's claim for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted, <i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 12(b)(6), and the district court granted the motion with respect to all five defendants. Gagliardi appeals this dismissal, but only with respect to Mayor Sullivan and the City. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Facts</i></p>\n<p>Since the district court dismissed Gagliardi's complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), we assume the truth of the well-pleaded facts therein. <i>Martinez-Rivera v. Sanchez Ramos,</i> 498 F.3d 3, 5 (1st Cir. 2007); <i>see also </i><i>Ruiz v. Bally Total Fitness Holding Corp.,</i> 496 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2007), We draw our recounting of the relevant facts from the complaint and the documents annexed to it or fairly incorporated within it. <i>See </i><i>Wetmore v. MacDonald, Page, Schatz, Fletcher &amp; Co., LLC,</i> 476 F.3d 1, 2 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The Board was a nonprofit corporation established pursuant to the Workforce Investment Act §§ 101-195, 29 U.S.C. §§ 2801-2945 (2007). Its duties included determining how to allocate federal, state, and local funds to occupational training in Lawrence and surrounding communities, establishing workforce development policy, and assisting in overseeing two \"one-stop career centers\" in the Lawrence area. During the relevant period, Mayor Sullivan served as the Board's Chief Elected Official. Among Mayor Sullivan's duties as Chief Elected Official was to appoint members to the Board. <i>See id.</i> § 2832(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>The Workforce Investment Act requires that local boards be certified by the governor of the state every two years, based on certain specified criteria. <i>See id.</i> § 2832(c)(2). During the relevant period, then-Governor Mitt Romney (\"Governor Romney\") delegated responsibility for certifying workforce investment boards, along with receiving and evaluating certification-related documents, to the Massachusetts Division of Career Services (\"DCS\"), headed by Susan V. Lawler (\"Commissioner Lawler\"). DCS was a subunit of the Massachusetts Department of Workforce Development (\"DWD\"), headed by Ranch Kimball (\"Secretary Kimball\").<sup>[2]</sup> DCS conditionally certified Gagliardi's Board sometime in 2004 pending the fulfillment of certain criteria.</p>\n<p>At a certain point, the Board became concerned with the way Mayor Sullivan was using grant money subject to the Board's jurisdiction. It set up a task force, which in the summer of 2005<sup>[3]</sup> uncovered a covert fund of some $1.1 million <span class=\"star-pagination\">*304</span> which Mayor Sullivan was using for his own purposes. The Board produced a report exposing the existence of the fund and criticizing Mayor Sullivan's use of Board funds in general.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the Board was having problems obtaining its biennial certification from DCS. It had submitted a certification package sometime in 2004, but DCS stated that it would not certify the Board until Mayor Sullivan had completed certain tasks,<sup>[4]</sup> which he failed to do throughout 2005. DCS cited this failure as a reason for its inability to grant full certification to the Board.</p>\n<p>In September 2005, the City acknowledged that the Board had compiled all the certification documents \"within its purview,\" but that \"there [were] a few items that remain[ed] which [were] dependent on City of Lawrence Decisions.\" Soon thereafter, Gagliardi and the Board's chair disclosed Mayor Sullivan's inaction to a local newspaper, which published an article on the matter on September 13, 2005. According to Gagliardi's complaint, this publicity infuriated Mayor Sullivan's brother, Kevin Sullivan, who purportedly threatened to use his \"influence with the state\" to cause the Board to be decertified.</p>\n<p>On October 21, 2005, Commissioner Lawler informed the Board that, due to its continued conditionally certified status, it was no longer authorized to undertake workforce development business, and would be confined to whatever business was necessary to rectify outstanding certification issues. Mayor Sullivan put attorney William DiAdamo in charge of compiling and presenting a final certification package to DCS. Apparently as part of this package, DiAdamo drafted a new set of Board bylaws which, <i>inter alia,</i> would give Mayor Sullivan the power to dismiss board members at will. The Board chair refused to go along with the termination provision, claiming it was inconsistent with the Workforce Investment Act. Gagliardi claims that, in response to this refusal, DiAdamo's father \"said he had powerful allies in . . . Ranch Kimball's office, who would decertify the [Board] on a moment's notice.\"</p>\n<p>According to the complaint, at some point in November 2005, Mayor Sullivan met \"at a secret location with four DCS and/or DWD officials.\" At the end of the meeting, \"the Mayor announced that he had disbanded the Board.\" Mayor Sullivan and DCS took the position that the Board had to be dissolved because of its failure to submit a complete certification package, and Mayor Sullivan expressed the view that conflicts among the Board's members had prevented it from functioning effectively.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Procedure in the District Court</i></p>\n<p>On March 28, 2006, Gagliardi filed suit in the district court under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming that Mayor Sullivan, the City, Commissioner Lawler, Secretary Kimball, and Governor Romney had infringed his constitutional rights to free speech and procedural due process. He averred, <i>inter alia,</i> that \"[t]he Board, members were fired for performing an oversight function required by federal law,\" and that Mayor Sullivan and DCS conspired to destroy the Board by interfering with the certification process. Gagliardi sought, <i>inter alia,</i> a declaration that the termination of the Board was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*305</span> unlawful, an injunction reinstating the Board and requiring Mayor Sullivan to assist it in achieving certification, and compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p>Governor Romney, Secretary Kimball, and Commissioner Lawler moved jointly under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss Gagliardi's complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. Neither Mayor Sullivan nor the City joined the motion. At the hearing on the motion, counsel for Governor Romney, Secretary Kimball, and Commissioner Lawler presented arguments, as did counsel for Gagliardi; counsel for Mayor Sullivan and the City was in attendance, but made no submissions and acknowledged that he was \"not obviously participating substantively in the discussions. . . .\" The district court dismissed all of Gagliardi's federal claimsnot only against Governor Romney, Secretary Kimball, and Commissioner Lawler, but also against Mayor Sullivan and the Cityand remanded the state claims to Massachusetts court.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>C. <i>Procedure on Appeal</i></p>\n<p>DJ Gagliardi appealed the dismissal of his complaint, only with respect to Mayor Sullivan, the City, and Commissioner Lawler. Commissioner Lawler filed a response brief; Mayor Sullivan and the City did not, and did not appear for oral argument. Before oral argument, Commissioner Lawler and Gagliardi moved pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b) to dismiss the appeal with respect to her. We granted the motion.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n<p>To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), the factual allegations in a complaint must \"possess enough heft\" to set forth \"a plausible entitlement to relief.\" <i>Bell AU. Corp. v. Twombly,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 27 S.Ct. 1955, 1966-67, 167 L.Ed.2d 929 (2007). Dismissal for failure to state a claim is appropriate if the complaint fails to set forth \"`factual allegations, either direct or inferential, respecting each material element necessary to sustain recovery under some actionable legal theory.'\" <i>Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio,</i> 406 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>Berner v. Delahanty,</i> 129 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir.1997)).</p>\n<p>We review a district court's order granting a motion to dismiss <i>de novo. Id.</i> at 5. Although we take the well-pleaded facts in the light most favorable to the plaintiff and indulge him all reasonable inferences, <i>Berner,</i> 129 F.3d at 23, we need not credit \"bald assertions, periphrastic circumlocutions, unsubstantiated conclusions, or outright vituperation,\" or \"subjective characterizations, optimistic predictions, or problematic suppositions.\" <i>Wash. Legal Found. v. Mass. Bar Found.,</i> 993 F.2d 962, 971 (1st Cir.1993) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>accord </i><i>Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*306</span> <i>Coll.,</i> 889 F.2d 13, 16 (1st Cir.1989), <i>overruled on other grounds by </i><i>Educadores Puertorrigueños en Acción v. Hernandez,</i> 367 F.3d 61 (1st Cir.2004). We may augment the facts in the complaint by reference to \"(i) documents annexed to [the complaint] or fairly incorporated into it, and (ii) matters susceptible to judicial notice.\" <i>Nisselson v. Lernout,</i> 469 F.3d 143, 150 (1st Cir.2006).<sup>[7]</sup></p>\n<p>B. <i>42 U.S.C. § 1983</i></p>\n<p>Section 1983 is a vehicle through which individuals may sue certain persons for depriving them of federally assured rights, such as the First Amendment's right to free speech or the Fourteenth Amendment's right to procedural due process. <i>See </i><i>Centro Medico del Turabo,</i> 406 F.3d at 6 n. 2. A claim under § 1983 has two \"essential elements\": the defendant must have acted under color of state law, and his or her conduct must have deprived the plaintiff of rights secured by the Constitution or by federal law. <i>Rodríguez-Cirilo v. Garcia,</i> 115 F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir. 1997). The second element requires the plaintiff to show \"that the [defendant's] conduct was the cause in fact of the alleged deprivation.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>1. <i>Free Speech Claim</i></p>\n<p>Claims of retaliatory adverse employment action for the exercise of First Amendment rights are cognizable under § 1983. <i>See </i><i>Powell v. Alexander,</i> 391 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir.2004). To make out such a claim in the present circumstances, the well-pleaded facts in the complaint, considered together with the documents annexed to it or fairly incorporated within it, must establish that Gagliardi's speech was protected under the First Amendment so as to shield him from adverse employment action in retaliation for such speech,<sup>[8]</sup> and that he suffered adverse employment action caused by Mayor Sullivan and the City. In addition, there is a third question concerned with causation, \"with whether the plaintiff can show that the protected expression was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision.\" <i>Curran v. Cousins,</i> 509 F.3d 36, 45 (1st Cir.2007).<sup>[9]</sup> The employer must, of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*307</span> course, \"have the opportunity to prove that it would have made the same decision regardless of the protected expression.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 287, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977)).</p>\n<p>Read in the light most favorable to Gagliardi and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor, the complaint cites two concrete instances of speech which allegedly provoked the retaliatory dissolution of the Board. The first was in the summer of 2005, when the Board issued its report exposing the existence of Mayor Sullivan's $1.1 million covert fund. The second was the September 13, 2005 newspaper article in which Gagliardi and the chair of the Board exposed Mayor Sullivan's persistent failure to perform the tasks necessary for the Board to complete its certification package. Neither allegation is sufficient to state a claim on which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p>First, it is evident that neither Mayor Sullivan nor anyone else whose conduct may be imputed to the City was directly responsible for decertifying, and thus dissolving, the Board. Despite the occasional asseveration that Mayor Sullivan himself \"fired,\" \"terminated,\" or \"disbanded\" the Boardand thus \"fired\" or \"terminated\" its membersit is clear that only the governor and those acting with authority delegated by him were empowered to certify or decertify workforce investment boards. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 2832(c). Nowhere does Gagliardi allege that Governor Romney delegated this authority to Mayor Sullivan or another Lawrence city official. He instead admits that Governor Romney delegated it to DCS, and that it was Commissioner Lawler as head of DCS who oversaw the certification process, including by corresponding with the Board on the steps still needed to achieve certification, and by ultimately deciding that the Board could transact no further workforce development business until it submitted a complete and satisfactory certification package. According to the complaint, Mayor Sullivan did not announce the Board's dissolution until after he had met in secret with unnamed officials from DCS or from DWD, the state agency of which DCS formed part. We reject the complaint's intimation that Mayor Sullivan somehow twisted the arm of these officials, during, this meeting or elsewhere, to persuade them to decertify the Board; this allegation is conclusory and is not substantiated by reasonable inference from the well-pleaded facts. <i>See </i><i>Dartmouth Review,</i> 889 F.2d at 16.<sup>[10]</sup> The well-pleaded facts do not demonstrate that either Mayor Sullivan or any other Lawrence city official made or directly compelled the state officials to make the decision to decertify.</p>\n<p>Second, Gagliardi's complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to him, can also be read as making an allegation of indirect causation between Mayor Sullivan and the decision to decertify. The Board was decertified for failing to submit a complete certification package. While the Board had, sometime in 2004, turned in all the required documentation it could to DCS, it fell to Mayor Sullivan as Chief Elected Official to undertake the remaining tasks necessary for certification. Gagliardi argues that Mayor Sullivan deliberately refrained from undertaking these <span class=\"star-pagination\">*308</span> tasks in retaliation for the critical report, the newspaper article, or both.</p>\n<p>Yet even if Gagliardi could manage to prove at trial a causal nexus between Mayor Sullivan's deliberate inaction and the decision to decertify the Boardincluding that DCS would have certified the Board but for Mayor Sullivan's inactionhe has failed to demonstrate that either instance of speech was a substantial or motivating factor behind the inaction. The complaint avers that the certification package was ready, with the exception of the tasks required of Mayor Sullivan, sometime in 2004. According to the complaint, \"[t]hroughout 2005, the Mayor, through his inaction, prevented the certification process from being completed.\" These facts plainly indicate that Mayor Sullivan's inaction began at least some months before the two instances of speech, which occurred respectively in the summer of 2005 and on September 13, 2005. The speech in question did not provoke Mayor Sullivan to abstain from undertaking his certification-related tasks; such abstention long predated the speech and continued up to the Board's November 2005 decertification. <i>See </i><i>Johnson v. Louisiana,</i> 369 F.3d 826, 830 (5th Cir.2004) (\"[I]f the decision-maker who imposed the adverse employment action was not motivated by the speech, then the speech did not cause the adverse employment action.\"). Even if a causal link could be demonstrated between Mayor Sullivan's inaction and the decision to decertify the Board, Gagliardi has failed to plead sufficient facts to show that his speech was a substantial or motivating factor behind Mayor Sullivan's inaction.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, Gagliardi has failed to state a plausible entitlement to relief on the free speech claim: he has not alleged sufficient well-pleaded facts to demonstrate that Mayor Sullivan or the City directly caused the Board's decertification or that, if Mayor Sullivan indirectly caused the decertification through his inaction, that the speech in question was a substantial or motivating factor behind such inaction. No relief could therefore be granted on this claim if the case were to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Due Process Claim</i></p>\n<p>What we have said above allows us to dispose of Gagliardi's Fourteenth Amendment due process claim in short order. Invoking <i>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. 532, 105 S.Ct. 1487, 84 L.Ed.2d 494 (1985), Gagliardi argues that he had a property interest in his position on the Board, and that he was deprived of this interest without due process of law by not being told the reasons for the Board's dissolution and his consequent dismissal, or being given an opportunity to be heard. <i>See </i><i>Alvarado-Aguilera v. Negrón,</i> 509 F.3d 50, 52 (1st Cir. 2007) (plaintiff must \"`exhibit a constitutionally protected interest in life, liberty, or property'\" to state a valid claim for a violation of Fourteenth Amendment due process (quoting <i>Centro Medico del Turabo,</i> 406 F.3d at 8)); <i>id.</i> (\"Property interests are created and defined by `existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.'\") (quoting <i>Hatfield-Bermudez v. Aldanondo-Rivera,</i> 496 F.3d 51, 59 (1st Cir.2007)); <i>Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. at 542, 105 S.Ct. 1487 (notice and an opportunity to be heard are \"essential principle[sl of due process\").</p>\n<p>This claim appears to be a relic from a time when the state officials ostensibly responsible for the decision to decertify the. BoardGovernor Romney, Secretary Kimball (for DWD), and Commissioner Lawler (for DCS)were still defendants in this case. We need not reach the question of whether Massachusetts law gave Gagliardi a property interest in continued <span class=\"star-pagination\">*309</span> appointment to the Board because he cannot make out a due process claim even if he can show such an interest. This is so because neither Mayor Sullivan nor any other Lawrence official was responsible for the decision to decertify the Board, and they accordingly had no duty to provide Gagliardi with notice or an opportunity to be heard. If anyone owed Gagliardi such guaranteesagain, a question we do not reachit would have been Governor Romney, Secretary Kimball, Commissioner Lawler, or some other state official with the proper authorization; none of these persons is a party to the lawsuit. <i>Cf. </i><i>Woods v. City of Michigan City, Ind.,</i> 940 F.2d 275, 279 (7th Cir.1991) (defendants city and county not liable under § 1983 where official whose order arguably deprived plaintiff of constitutionally protected liberty interest without due process was a non-defendant state judge). Thus, Gagliardi has again failed to state a plausible entitlement to relief. The district court did not err in dismissing this claim under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the dismissal of Gagliardi's complaint. No costs are awarded.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Gagliardi also made a state law claim that is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p>[2]  Governor Romney, Secretary Kimball, and Commissioner Lawler were originally named as defendants in this lawsuit along with Mayor Sullivan and the City.</p>\n<p>[3]  Gagliardi omits to state in his complaint or brief the date on which the report was issued. We glean the fact that it was issued sometime in the summer of 2005 from the September 13, 2005 newspaper article on this incident, which Gagliardi attached to his complaint.</p>\n<p>[4]  A city department known as the Division of Training and Development (\"DTD\") assisted in the operation of the two Lawrence-area career centers, and was originally, also the employer of record of the Board members, \"Title I administrator,\" and fiscal agent. The Board complained to DCS that state policy forbade the DTD from performing these latter functions, and it was agreed that they would be transferred to another entity. As Chief Elected Official, this responsibility fell to Mayor Sullivan.</p>\n<p>[5]  By agreement among the parties, all claims against Governor Romney were dismissed, as were all claims against all defendants in their official capacities for compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p>[6]  After Commissioner Lawler was dismissed, Mayor Sullivan and the City filed a letter stating that they \"formally adopt\" the arguments made in Commissioner Lawler's brief \"as their own.\" An appellee cannot, however, simply adopt the arguments of another appellee without making some effort at explaining how those arguments apply to its case, particularly in the present circumstances where Commissioner Lawler's position and alleged conduct differ in several important respects from those of Mayor Sullivan. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Casas,</i> 425 F.3d 23, 30 n. 2 (2005). We decline the invitation to scour Commissioner Lawler's brief in search of arguments that might be availing to Mayor Sullivan and the City. <i>See id.,</i> 425 F.3d at 30 n. 2.</p>\n<p>[7]  Gagliardi may have been entitled to different treatment because, while he was clearly on notice that the district court might grant the Rule 12(b)(6) motion with respect to its proponents Romney, Kimball, and Lawler, he may not have been' on notice that the district court would also dismiss the complaint with respect to Sullivan and the City. As discussed above, Sullivan and the City did hot join the motion or make arguments at the motion hearing. <i>See </i><i>Chute v. Walker,</i> 281 F.3d 314, 319 (1st Cir.2002) (sua sponte dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) upheld only if \"[i]f it is crystal clear that the plaintiff cannot prevail and that amending the complaint would be futile\") (quoting <i>Gonzalez-Gonzalez v. United States,</i> 257 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir.2001)). Nevertheless, Gagliardi did not object at the hearing and has not raised this issue on appeal, so we apply the normal standard. <i>See Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17.</p>\n<p>[8]  Whether a public employee is shielded from adverse employment action for engaging in speech is governed by a two-step inquiry that asks \"`whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern'\" and, if so, \"`whether the relevant government entity had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public.'\" <i>Curran v. Cousins,</i> 509 F.3d 36, 45 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> 547 U.S. 410, 126 S.Ct, 1951, 1958, 164 L.Ed.2d 689 (2006)). These are issues of law for the court. As discussed below, the third issue is causation.</p>\n<p>[9]  As a general rule, we abstain at this stage of the proceedings from deciding whether this element has been established, since it \"`normally presents a factfinding responsibility for the jury.'\" <i>Gamier v. Rodriguez,</i> 506 F.3d 22, 27 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>Nethersole v. Bulger,</i> 287 F.3d 15, 18-19 (1st Cir.2002)). In this case we are presented with a rare exception to the general rule, as the complaint is so patently deficient.</p>\n<p>[10]  We similarly give no credit to any notion that Kevin Sullivan, Mayor Sullivan's brother, carried out his threat to use his \"influence with the state\" to cause the Board to be decertified in retaliation for the newspaper article, or that DiAdamo's father carried out his threat to contact \"powerful allies in . . . Ranch Kimball's office, who would decertify the [Board] on a moment's notice.\" In any event, the complaint does not allege that either man actually approached any state official to urge decertification.</p>\n\n</div>",

He brought suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983,<sup>[1]</sup> claiming that Michael Sullivan, Lawrence's mayor (\"Mayor Sullivan\"), along with the. City of Lawrence itself (\"City\") and three state officials, were responsible for the Board's dissolution and his consequent dismissal, and that such conduct amounted to a violation of his First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The three state officials moved to dismiss Gagliardi's claim for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted, <i>see</i> Fed.

MacDonald, Page, Schatz, Fletcher &amp; Co., LLC,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"796736\"><a href=\"/opinion/796736/frank-u-wetmore-v-macdonald-page-schatz-fletcher-company-llc/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The Board was a nonprofit corporation established pursuant to the Workforce Investment Act §§ 101-195, 29 U.S.C. §§ 2801-2945 (2007). Its duties included determining how to allocate federal, state, and local funds to occupational training in Lawrence and surrounding communities, establishing workforce development policy, and assisting in overseeing two \"one-stop career centers\" in the Lawrence area. During the relevant period, Mayor Sullivan served as the Board's Chief Elected Official. Among Mayor Sullivan's duties as Chief Elected Official was to appoint members to the Board. <i>See id.</i> § 2832(c)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>The Workforce Investment Act requires that local boards be certified by the governor of the state every two years, based on certain specified criteria. <i>See id.</i> § 2832(c)(2). During the relevant period, then-Governor Mitt Romney (\"Governor Romney\") delegated responsibility for certifying workforce investment boards, along with receiving and evaluating certification-related documents, to the Massachusetts Division of Career Services (\"DCS\"), headed by Susan V. Lawler (\"Commissioner Lawler\"). DCS was a subunit of the Massachusetts Department of Workforce Development (\"DWD\"), headed by Ranch Kimball (\"Secretary Kimball\").<sup>[2]</sup> DCS conditionally certified Gagliardi's Board sometime in 2004 pending the fulfillment of certain criteria.</p>\n<p>At a certain point, the Board became concerned with the way Mayor Sullivan was using grant money subject to the Board's jurisdiction. It set up a task force, which in the summer of 2005<sup>[3]</sup> uncovered a covert fund of some $1.1 million <span class=\"star-pagination\">*304</span> which Mayor Sullivan was using for his own purposes. The Board produced a report exposing the existence of the fund and criticizing Mayor Sullivan's use of Board funds in general.</p>\n<p>In the meantime, the Board was having problems obtaining its biennial certification from DCS. It had submitted a certification package sometime in 2004, but DCS stated that it would not certify the Board until Mayor Sullivan had completed certain tasks,<sup>[4]</sup> which he failed to do throughout 2005. DCS cited this failure as a reason for its inability to grant full certification to the Board.</p>\n<p>In September 2005, the City acknowledged that the Board had compiled all the certification documents \"within its purview,\" but that \"there [were] a few items that remain[ed] which [were] dependent on City of Lawrence Decisions.\" Soon thereafter, Gagliardi and the Board's chair disclosed Mayor Sullivan's inaction to a local newspaper, which published an article on the matter on September 13, 2005. According to Gagliardi's complaint, this publicity infuriated Mayor Sullivan's brother, Kevin Sullivan, who purportedly threatened to use his \"influence with the state\" to cause the Board to be decertified.</p>\n<p>On October 21, 2005, Commissioner Lawler informed the Board that, due to its continued conditionally certified status, it was no longer authorized to undertake workforce development business, and would be confined to whatever business was necessary to rectify outstanding certification issues. Mayor Sullivan put attorney William DiAdamo in charge of compiling and presenting a final certification package to DCS. Apparently as part of this package, DiAdamo drafted a new set of Board bylaws which, <i>inter alia,</i> would give Mayor Sullivan the power to dismiss board members at will. The Board chair refused to go along with the termination provision, claiming it was inconsistent with the Workforce Investment Act. Gagliardi claims that, in response to this refusal, DiAdamo's father \"said he had powerful allies in . . . Ranch Kimball's office, who would decertify the [Board] on a moment's notice.\"</p>\n<p>According to the complaint, at some point in November 2005, Mayor Sullivan met \"at a secret location with four DCS and/or DWD officials.\" At the end of the meeting, \"the Mayor announced that he had disbanded the Board.\" Mayor Sullivan and DCS took the position that the Board had to be dissolved because of its failure to submit a complete certification package, and Mayor Sullivan expressed the view that conflicts among the Board's members had prevented it from functioning effectively.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Procedure in the District Court</i></p>\n<p>On March 28, 2006, Gagliardi filed suit in the district court under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, claiming that Mayor Sullivan, the City, Commissioner Lawler, Secretary Kimball, and Governor Romney had infringed his constitutional rights to free speech and procedural due process. He averred, <i>inter alia,</i> that \"[t]he Board, members were fired for performing an oversight function required by federal law,\" and that Mayor Sullivan and DCS conspired to destroy the Board by interfering with the certification process. Gagliardi sought, <i>inter alia,</i> a declaration that the termination of the Board was <span class=\"star-pagination\">*305</span> unlawful, an injunction reinstating the Board and requiring Mayor Sullivan to assist it in achieving certification, and compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p>Governor Romney, Secretary Kimball, and Commissioner Lawler moved jointly under Rule 12(b)(6) to dismiss Gagliardi's complaint for failure to state a claim on which relief could be granted. Neither Mayor Sullivan nor the City joined the motion. At the hearing on the motion, counsel for Governor Romney, Secretary Kimball, and Commissioner Lawler presented arguments, as did counsel for Gagliardi; counsel for Mayor Sullivan and the City was in attendance, but made no submissions and acknowledged that he was \"not obviously participating substantively in the discussions. . . .\" The district court dismissed all of Gagliardi's federal claimsnot only against Governor Romney, Secretary Kimball, and Commissioner Lawler, but also against Mayor Sullivan and the Cityand remanded the state claims to Massachusetts court.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>C. <i>Procedure on Appeal</i></p>\n<p>DJ Gagliardi appealed the dismissal of his complaint, only with respect to Mayor Sullivan, the City, and Commissioner Lawler. Commissioner Lawler filed a response brief; Mayor Sullivan and the City did not, and did not appear for oral argument. Before oral argument, Commissioner Lawler and Gagliardi moved pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 42(b) to dismiss the appeal with respect to her. We granted the motion.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>A. <i>Standard of Review</i></p>\n<p>To survive a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under Rule 12(b)(6), the factual allegations in a complaint must \"possess enough heft\" to set forth \"a plausible entitlement to relief.\" <i>Bell AU.

A claim under § 1983 has two \"essential elements\": the defendant must have acted under color of state law, and his or her conduct must have deprived the plaintiff of rights secured by the Constitution or by federal law. <i>Rodríguez-Cirilo v. Garcia,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197391\"><a href=\"/opinion/197391/rodriguez-cirilo-v-garcia/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 52 (1st Cir. 1997). The second element requires the plaintiff to show \"that the [defendant's] conduct was the cause in fact of the alleged deprivation.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>1. <i>Free Speech Claim</i></p>\n<p>Claims of retaliatory adverse employment action for the exercise of First Amendment rights are cognizable under § 1983. <i>See </i><i>Powell v. Alexander,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201350\"><a href=\"/opinion/201350/powell-v-alexander/\"><span class=\"volume\">391</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.2004). To make out such a claim in the present circumstances, the well-pleaded facts in the complaint, considered together with the documents annexed to it or fairly incorporated within it, must establish that Gagliardi's speech was protected under the First Amendment so as to shield him from adverse employment action in retaliation for such speech,<sup>[8]</sup> and that he suffered adverse employment action caused by Mayor Sullivan and the City. In addition, there is a third question concerned with causation, \"with whether the plaintiff can show that the protected expression was a substantial or motivating factor in the adverse employment decision.\" <i>Curran v. Cousins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203052\"><a href=\"/opinion/203052/curran-v-cousins/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2007).<sup>[9]</sup> The employer must, of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*307</span> course, \"have the opportunity to prove that it would have made the same decision regardless of the protected expression.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Mt.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span> (1977)).</p>\n<p>Read in the light most favorable to Gagliardi and drawing all reasonable inferences in his favor, the complaint cites two concrete instances of speech which allegedly provoked the retaliatory dissolution of the Board. The first was in the summer of 2005, when the Board issued its report exposing the existence of Mayor Sullivan's $1.1 million covert fund. The second was the September 13, 2005 newspaper article in which Gagliardi and the chair of the Board exposed Mayor Sullivan's persistent failure to perform the tasks necessary for the Board to complete its certification package. Neither allegation is sufficient to state a claim on which relief can be granted.</p>\n<p>First, it is evident that neither Mayor Sullivan nor anyone else whose conduct may be imputed to the City was directly responsible for decertifying, and thus dissolving, the Board. Despite the occasional asseveration that Mayor Sullivan himself \"fired,\" \"terminated,\" or \"disbanded\" the Boardand thus \"fired\" or \"terminated\" its membersit is clear that only the governor and those acting with authority delegated by him were empowered to certify or decertify workforce investment boards. <i>See</i> 29 U.S.C. § 2832(c). Nowhere does Gagliardi allege that Governor Romney delegated this authority to Mayor Sullivan or another Lawrence city official. He instead admits that Governor Romney delegated it to DCS, and that it was Commissioner Lawler as head of DCS who oversaw the certification process, including by corresponding with the Board on the steps still needed to achieve certification, and by ultimately deciding that the Board could transact no further workforce development business until it submitted a complete and satisfactory certification package. According to the complaint, Mayor Sullivan did not announce the Board's dissolution until after he had met in secret with unnamed officials from DCS or from DWD, the state agency of which DCS formed part. We reject the complaint's intimation that Mayor Sullivan somehow twisted the arm of these officials, during, this meeting or elsewhere, to persuade them to decertify the Board; this allegation is conclusory and is not substantiated by reasonable inference from the well-pleaded facts. <i>See </i><i>Dartmouth Review,</i> 889 F.2d at 16.<sup>[10]</sup> The well-pleaded facts do not demonstrate that either Mayor Sullivan or any other Lawrence city official made or directly compelled the state officials to make the decision to decertify.</p>\n<p>Second, Gagliardi's complaint, viewed in the light most favorable to him, can also be read as making an allegation of indirect causation between Mayor Sullivan and the decision to decertify. The Board was decertified for failing to submit a complete certification package. While the Board had, sometime in 2004, turned in all the required documentation it could to DCS, it fell to Mayor Sullivan as Chief Elected Official to undertake the remaining tasks necessary for certification. Gagliardi argues that Mayor Sullivan deliberately refrained from undertaking these <span class=\"star-pagination\">*308</span> tasks in retaliation for the critical report, the newspaper article, or both.</p>\n<p>Yet even if Gagliardi could manage to prove at trial a causal nexus between Mayor Sullivan's deliberate inaction and the decision to decertify the Boardincluding that DCS would have certified the Board but for Mayor Sullivan's inactionhe has failed to demonstrate that either instance of speech was a substantial or motivating factor behind the inaction. The complaint avers that the certification package was ready, with the exception of the tasks required of Mayor Sullivan, sometime in 2004. According to the complaint, \"[t]hroughout 2005, the Mayor, through his inaction, prevented the certification process from being completed.\" These facts plainly indicate that Mayor Sullivan's inaction began at least some months before the two instances of speech, which occurred respectively in the summer of 2005 and on September 13, 2005. The speech in question did not provoke Mayor Sullivan to abstain from undertaking his certification-related tasks; such abstention long predated the speech and continued up to the Board's November 2005 decertification. <i>See </i><i>Johnson v. Louisiana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"35239\"><a href=\"/opinion/35239/johnson-v-state-of-louisiana/\"><span class=\"volume\">369</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">826</span></a></span>, 830 (5th Cir.2004) (\"[I]f the decision-maker who imposed the adverse employment action was not motivated by the speech, then the speech did not cause the adverse employment action.\"). Even if a causal link could be demonstrated between Mayor Sullivan's inaction and the decision to decertify the Board, Gagliardi has failed to plead sufficient facts to show that his speech was a substantial or motivating factor behind Mayor Sullivan's inaction.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, Gagliardi has failed to state a plausible entitlement to relief on the free speech claim: he has not alleged sufficient well-pleaded facts to demonstrate that Mayor Sullivan or the City directly caused the Board's decertification or that, if Mayor Sullivan indirectly caused the decertification through his inaction, that the speech in question was a substantial or motivating factor behind such inaction. No relief could therefore be granted on this claim if the case were to proceed to trial.</p>\n<p>2. <i>Due Process Claim</i></p>\n<p>What we have said above allows us to dispose of Gagliardi's Fourteenth Amendment due process claim in short order. Invoking <i>Cleveland Bd. of Educ. v. Loudermill,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">532</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Aldanondo-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1454041\"><a href=\"/opinion/1454041/hatfield-bermudez-v-aldanondo-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">496</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">51</span></a></span>, 59 (1st Cir.2007)); <i>Loudermill,</i> 470 U.S. at 542, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111372\"><a href=\"/opinion/111372/cleveland-bd-of-ed-v-loudermill/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1487</span></a></span> (notice and an opportunity to be heard are \"essential principle[sl of due process\").</p>\n<p>This claim appears to be a relic from a time when the state officials ostensibly responsible for the decision to decertify the. BoardGovernor Romney, Secretary Kimball (for DWD), and Commissioner Lawler (for DCS)were still defendants in this case. We need not reach the question of whether Massachusetts law gave Gagliardi a property interest in continued <span class=\"star-pagination\">*309</span> appointment to the Board because he cannot make out a due process claim even if he can show such an interest. This is so because neither Mayor Sullivan nor any other Lawrence official was responsible for the decision to decertify the Board, and they accordingly had no duty to provide Gagliardi with notice or an opportunity to be heard. If anyone owed Gagliardi such guaranteesagain, a question we do not reachit would have been Governor Romney, Secretary Kimball, Commissioner Lawler, or some other state official with the proper authorization; none of these persons is a party to the lawsuit. <i>Cf. </i><i>Woods v. City of Michigan City, Ind.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"565241\"><a href=\"/opinion/565241/jon-m-woods-and-connie-blakley-v-city-of-michigan-city-indiana-michael/\"><span class=\"volume\">940</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 279 (7th Cir.1991) (defendants city and county not liable under § 1983 where official whose order arguably deprived plaintiff of constitutionally protected liberty interest without due process was a non-defendant state judge). Thus, Gagliardi has again failed to state a plausible entitlement to relief. The district court did not err in dismissing this claim under Rule 12(b)(6).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the dismissal of Gagliardi's complaint. No costs are awarded.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  Gagliardi also made a state law claim that is not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p>[2]  Governor Romney, Secretary Kimball, and Commissioner Lawler were originally named as defendants in this lawsuit along with Mayor Sullivan and the City.</p>\n<p>[3]  Gagliardi omits to state in his complaint or brief the date on which the report was issued. We glean the fact that it was issued sometime in the summer of 2005 from the September 13, 2005 newspaper article on this incident, which Gagliardi attached to his complaint.</p>\n<p>[4]  A city department known as the Division of Training and Development (\"DTD\") assisted in the operation of the two Lawrence-area career centers, and was originally, also the employer of record of the Board members, \"Title I administrator,\" and fiscal agent. The Board complained to DCS that state policy forbade the DTD from performing these latter functions, and it was agreed that they would be transferred to another entity. As Chief Elected Official, this responsibility fell to Mayor Sullivan.</p>\n<p>[5]  By agreement among the parties, all claims against Governor Romney were dismissed, as were all claims against all defendants in their official capacities for compensatory and punitive damages.</p>\n<p>[6]  After Commissioner Lawler was dismissed, Mayor Sullivan and the City filed a letter stating that they \"formally adopt\" the arguments made in Commissioner Lawler's brief \"as their own.\" An appellee cannot, however, simply adopt the arguments of another appellee without making some effort at explaining how those arguments apply to its case, particularly in the present circumstances where Commissioner Lawler's position and alleged conduct differ in several important respects from those of Mayor Sullivan. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Casas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"792073\"><a href=\"/opinion/792073/united-states-v-angel-casas-united-states-of-america-v-jose/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 30 n. 2 (2005). We decline the invitation to scour Commissioner Lawler's brief in search of arguments that might be availing to Mayor Sullivan and the City. <i>See id.,</i> 425 F.3d at 30 n. 2.</p>\n<p>[7]  Gagliardi may have been entitled to different treatment because, while he was clearly on notice that the district court might grant the Rule 12(b)(6) motion with respect to its proponents Romney, Kimball, and Lawler, he may not have been' on notice that the district court would also dismiss the complaint with respect to Sullivan and the City. As discussed above, Sullivan and the City did hot join the motion or make arguments at the motion hearing. <i>See </i><i>Chute v. Walker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199852\"><a href=\"/opinion/199852/chute-v-city-of-cambridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">314</span></a></span>, 319 (1st Cir.2002) (sua sponte dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) upheld only if \"[i]f it is crystal clear that the plaintiff cannot prevail and that amending the complaint would be futile\") (quoting <i>Gonzalez-Gonzalez v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199505\"><a href=\"/opinion/199505/united-states-v-gonzalez-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">31</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2001)). Nevertheless, Gagliardi did not object at the hearing and has not raised this issue on appeal, so we apply the normal standard. <i>See Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d at 17.</p>\n<p>[8]  Whether a public employee is shielded from adverse employment action for engaging in speech is governed by a two-step inquiry that asks \"`whether the employee spoke as a citizen on a matter of public concern'\" and, if so, \"`whether the relevant government entity had an adequate justification for treating the employee differently from any other member of the general public.'\" <i>Curran v. Cousins,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203052\"><a href=\"/opinion/203052/curran-v-cousins/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>Garcetti v. Ceballos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">547</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">410</span></a></span>, 126 S.Ct, 1951, 1958, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145653\"><a href=\"/opinion/145653/garcetti-v-ceballos/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span> (2006)). These are issues of law for the court. As discussed below, the third issue is causation.</p>\n<p>[9]  As a general rule, we abstain at this stage of the proceedings from deciding whether this element has been established, since it \"`normally presents a factfinding responsibility for the jury.'\" <i>Gamier v. Rodriguez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202986\"><a href=\"/opinion/202986/garnier-v-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2007) (quoting <i>Nethersole v. Bulger,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199918\"><a href=\"/opinion/199918/nethersole-v-bulger/\"><span class=\"volume\">287</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 18-19 (1st Cir.2002)). In this case we are presented with a rare exception to the general rule, as the complaint is so patently deficient.</p>\n<p>[10]  We similarly give no credit to any notion that Kevin Sullivan, Mayor Sullivan's brother, carried out his threat to use his \"influence with the state\" to cause the Board to be decertified in retaliation for the newspaper article, or that DiAdamo's father carried out his threat to contact \"powerful allies in . . . Ranch Kimball's office, who would decertify the [Board] on a moment's notice.\" In any event, the complaint does not allege that either man actually approached any state official to urge decertification.</p>\n\n</div>",
