Plaintiff Carlos J. López Hernández is a\n\ncareer employee of Puerto Rico's Department of Education for the\n\nMayaguez Region.     In 1992, López unsuccessfully ran for office as\n\na candidate of Puerto Rico's Popular Democratic Party.              That same\n\nyear, the candidate of the rival New Progressive Party won Puerto\n\nRico's gubernatorial election.           At some point in 1994, persons\n\naffiliated with the New Progressive Party assumed control of the\n\nDepartment of Education and implemented a \"reorganization,\" which\n\nit is undisputed had the effect of stripping López of his work\n\nduties.\n\n            Later   that    year,   López    sued     the   Secretary   of   the\n\nDepartment of Education, a former Secretary, and the Department's\n\nthen-Regional Director for the Mayaguez Region under 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983. His complaint alleged that the adverse employment actions he\n\nhad   suffered   were   prompted    by     unlawful    political-affiliation\n\ndiscrimination.     In November 1997, López settled the suit with the\n\nRegional Director.         In the settlement agreement, the Regional\n\nDirector promised, inter alia, either to keep López in his then-\n\ncurrent position (with commensurate duties and salary) or, in the\n\nevent of a reorganization, to transfer him to \"an equivalent\n\nposition, [with] corresponding duties and salary[.]\"\n\n            In May 1999, López filed, in connection with the 1994\n\ncase, a pro se \"Motion for Sentence Execution and Continuous\n\nDamages.\"    So far as we can tell, the motion alleged that the\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fdiscrimination complained of in the 1994 action was ongoing.                   The\n\ndistrict court denied the motion on the ground that it had not\n\nretained    jurisdiction         to     enforce     the    settlement    agreement.\n\nThereafter, in October 1999, López filed the present action against\n\nthe Department's Secretary and the Regional Director for the\n\nMayaguez Region, who is different than the person sued in this\n\ncapacity in the 1994 action.             In his complaint, López alleged that\n\nhe lacked job duties and ascribed this lack of duties to ongoing\n\n(since     the   November    1997        settlement        agreement)    political-\n\naffiliation discrimination.              Discovery ensued and the defendants\n\neventually sought summary judgment, which was granted by the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n            The court first adopted the defendants' account of the\n\nfacts because López failed to supply a statement of contested\n\nmaterial facts with record citations, as is required by D.P.R.R.\n\n311.12.     After concluding that López's damages claims against\n\ndefendants in their official capacities lacked viability, the court\n\ndecided that López's remaining claims against the Secretary failed\n\nbecause the Secretary was not personally involved in the acts set\n\nforth in the complaint and because liability under a respondeat\n\nsuperior theory does not attach in a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action.\n\nFinally, the court determined that López had failed to adduce\n\nevidence    sufficient      to        permit    a   jury   to   reject   the   non-\n\ndiscriminatory reason the Regional Director gave to explain López's\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\flack   of   duties,   viz.,   the   1994   reorganization   and   López's\n\nunwillingness to accept a proposed transfer to an equivalent\n\nposition with duties outside the Mayaguez regional office.            In\n\nmaking this determination, the court also stated:\n\n                   López alleges that several positions\n            within the scope of his classification were\n            available within the Mayaguez Regional Office,\n            but they were given to lesser ranking staff\n            who wore insignia on their clothes identifying\n            them as members of the NPP.        He further\n            alleges that [the Regional Director] \"has in\n            effect   admitted   her   bias   against   the\n            Plaintiff.\" These allegations, if true, could\n            constitute     sufficient    evidence     that\n            defendants' non-discriminatory reason is a\n            pretext.   But without specific reference to\n            the record as required by Local Rule 311.12,\n            they are mere allegations or arguments of\n            counsel that cannot be considered by the Court\n            in the summary judgment context.\n\nLópez Hernández v. Fajardo Vélez, Civil No. 99-2107 (JAG), opinion\n\nand order at 15 (D.P.R. Apr. 25, 2002).\n\n            López has appealed the district court's judgment insofar\n\nas it pertains to the Regional Director.       We construe his somewhat\n\nconvoluted brief to present two arguments: that the court erred in\n\nconcluding that he breached Local Rule 311.12 with respect to his\n\nevidence of the Regional Director's bias, and that the court erred\n\nin crediting the Regional Director's assertion that he declined at\n\nleast one equivalent job with duties outside the regional office\n\nwithout additional evidence to support the assertion.             Neither\n\nargument provides us with a basis for upsetting the judgment.         The\n\nfirst argument is insufficient because it is unaccompanied by an\n\n                                    -4-\n\fexplanation why the present Regional Director's bias against López,\n\neven   if   assumed     for   summary   judgment     purposes,   creates    a\n\ntrialworthy issue as to the credibility of the Regional Director's\n\nexplanation why López lacked duties. See Ainsworth v. Stanley, No.\n\n00-1678, slip op. at 4 n.1 (1st Cir. Dec. 24, 2002).             The second\n\nargument    is   insufficient    because   it   is   unaccompanied   by    an\n\nexplanation why the Regional Director needed to submit evidence to\n\ncorroborate her assertion in order to be awarded summary judgment.\n\nSee id.\n\n            The record in this case is troubling.          Nobody disputes\n\nthat López lacked job duties for years, and the Regional Director's\n\nexplanation for this state of affairs raises more questions than it\n\nanswers.    But we will not disturb a final district court judgment\n\nabsent a developed argument explaining why, in light of the record\n\nand applicable legal principles, the judgment was not properly\n\nentered.    See id.     López has failed to present us with such an\n\nargument.\n\n            Affirmed.    No costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\f",
