This appeal arises out of a\n\ndispute over the propriety of an order issued by the Insurance\n\nCommissioner of Puerto Rico declaring Andrés Guillemard Ginorio,\n\nhis wife, María Noble Fernández, and their insurance agency, Lone\n\nStar     Insurance        Producers         (collectively,       \"Plaintiffs\"),\n\nuntrustworthy    and     incompetent;       revoking   Plaintiffs'       insurance\n\nlicenses for five years; barring Plaintiffs from applying for other\n\ninsurance licenses for five years; and imposing a $2,035,000 fine.\n\n           Plaintiffs allege, inter alia, that in issuing this order\n\nwithout a hearing and in retaliation for their political beliefs,\n\nFermín   Contreras       Gómez,    former     Insurance      Commissioner,      and\n\nDorelisse Juarbe, the current Insurance Commissioner (collectively\n\n\"Defendants\"),     violated       Plaintiffs'       rights   under      the    First\n\nAmendment and the Due Process Clause. Plaintiffs moved for partial\n\nsummary judgment on their due process claim and Defendants moved\n\nfor summary judgment on all claims.              The district court granted\n\nPlaintiffs'     motion    for     partial    summary    judgment     and      denied\n\nDefendants'     motion.         Defendants    now    appeal.       In    addition,\n\nDefendants also take this opportunity to appeal the district\n\ncourt's denial of their motion to vacate the court's judgment under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) based on newly discovered evidence.                      After\n\ncareful consideration, we affirm the district court's denial of\n\nqualified immunity and dismiss any appeal taken from the court's\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fgrant of partial summary judgment or its denial of the motion to\n\nvacate.\n\n                  I. Factual and Procedural Background\n\n            Guillemard     and    Noble     founded     Lone   Star       Insurance\n\nProducers   in    1984.    Both    are    well-known     members     of    the   New\n\nProgressive Party (\"NPP\").\n\n            Early     in   2001,     Contreras        became   the        Insurance\n\nCommissioner for Puerto Rico.        On November 2, 2001, the Office of\n\nthe   Insurance     Commissioner    (\"OIC\")    assigned    Angela     Rivera     to\n\ninvestigate Urrutia Vallés, Inc. (\"UVI\"), an insurance brokerage\n\ncompany, for its conduct in connection with the performance of a\n\ncontract with the government of Puerto Rico.               For several years,\n\nLone Star and UVI had worked together in obtaining and servicing\n\nproperty, casualty, and other types of insurance for several\n\ngovernment agencies.       Pursuant to the investigation, Rivera found\n\nthat UVI paid commissions to Lone Star from the sale of the\n\ngovernment insurance policies.\n\n            On November 7, 2001, an article in El Nuevo Día, a Puerto\n\nRico newspaper, reported that the OIC investigation into UVI would\n\nalso include Guillemard.         That same day, Aurea López, the head of\n\nthe OIC's audit division, instructed Rivera to look for checks from\n\nUVI to Lone Star.\n\n            On November 20, 2001, the OIC issued a \"Notification and\n\nExamination Order\" calling for an audit of Lone Star's operations\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fand transactions from January 1, 1997 through September 30, 2001.\n\nThe notice did not allege any wrongdoing.             David Castro Anaya, an\n\nOIC   auditor,    was    assigned   to   perform      the   Lone   Star   audit.\n\nAccording to Castro, the sole purpose of his investigation was to\n\ndetermine whether improper payments had been made to third parties.\n\nGuillemard      made    available   to       Castro   two   Certified     Public\n\nAccountants to cooperate with the audit and provide all relevant\n\ndocuments.\n\n              By December 17, 2001, all of the documents pertaining to\n\ninsurance issued to government agencies had been examined and the\n\naudit   had    concluded.     Castro     informed     Guillemard    and   Miguel\n\nCarbonell, Lone Star's CPA, that he found no irregularities or\n\nimproprieties.      Castro also told Guillemard and Carbonell that he\n\nwould prepare a draft of his final report within the next few\n\nmonths and send them a copy.\n\n              At some point after November 20, 2001, but before March\n\n2002, Melvin Rosario, the Director of the Anti-Fraud Unit at the\n\nOIC and Castro's supervisor, met privately with Contreras to tell\n\nhim that he did not wish to investigate Lone Star for commission\n\nsharing.      He explained that the sharing of commissions, as in the\n\ncase of Lone Star and UVI, \"was common, normal, in the way that\n\nbusiness was conducted.       And that [his] opinion in that regard was\n\nthat [he] had not seen, in all honesty, anything in the Insurance\n\nCode indicating that this could not be done that way.\"                        In\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fresponse, Contreras told Rosario that he \"would have to carry [out]\n\nthe investigations against this N.P.P. member\" anyway.                                   Rosario\n\nasked to be relieved from the assignment, and Contreras agreed that\n\nCastro would report to López instead.\n\n            Early in 2002, Guillemard learned that the OIC had issued\n\nsubpoenas       to    several        Puerto        Rico       banks      demanding       account\n\ninformation for all transactions involving Guillemard, Noble, or\n\nLone Star.\n\n            On        July     10,       2003,      Castro          submitted      the      Final\n\nInvestigation Findings Report (the \"Report\") relating to the Lone\n\nStar    audit    to    his     supervisor.              He   did     not   send    a   copy    to\n\nGuillemard.          The     Report      found     no    improper        payments      to   third\n\nparties, but it raised other issues.                          In particular, the Report\n\nnoted    that    Lone        Star    had    entered          into    a   commission-sharing\n\narrangement with UVI.               The Report concluded that the sharing of\n\ncommissions is a violation of section 939(2) of the Puerto Rico\n\nInsurance Code.\n\n            At       the     end    of     2003,    Plaintiffs           were     still     being\n\ninvestigated by the OIC.              On December 10, 2003, Plaintiffs filed a\n\nfederal action against Contreras and the OIC, alleging that the\n\ninvestigation was motivated by political animus in violation of\n\ntheir rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments.                                  At that\n\ntime, the OIC had not issued any reports or orders in connection\n\n\n\n\n                                              -5-\n\fwith the Lone Star investigation since the submission of Castro's\n\nJuly report.\n\n            Contreras found out about Plaintiffs' lawsuit by the\n\nfollowing day.1    On December 23, 2003, Contreras issued an order\n\ndeclaring Plaintiffs incompetent and untrustworthy, revoking their\n\ninsurance licenses for a period of five years; denying them any\n\nlicense in any capacity for a period of five years; and imposing a\n\nfine of $2,035,000 (the \"Order\").        The Order stated that it would\n\nbecome effective on January 7, 2004, but provided that Plaintiffs\n\ncould request an administrative hearing to contest it.               The Order\n\nalso stated that a request for an administrative hearing would stay\n\nthe imposition of the fine, the declaration that Plaintiffs were\n\nincompetent and untrustworthy, and the denial of any license in any\n\ncapacity.      However, pursuant to the Order, the revocation of\n\nPlaintiffs'    licenses   would   remain     in   effect   pending    a   final\n\nadministrative decision.\n\n            Following   receipt   of   the   Order,   Plaintiffs      promptly\n\nrequested an administrative hearing.              They also amended their\n\ncomplaint to allege claims of retaliation under the First Amendment\n\nand violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, as\n\nwell as state law provisions.      In addition, Plaintiffs requested a\n\ntemporary restraining order to prevent the revocation from taking\n\n\n\n1\n    By this time, Contreras had submitted his resignation as\nInsurance Commissioner, effective at the end of December.\n\n                                   -6-\n\feffect, and moved for a preliminary injunction. The district court\n\ngranted the temporary restraining order and scheduled a hearing on\n\nthe motion for a preliminary injunction. After a hearing, at which\n\nonly Plaintiffs chose to present evidence, the district court\n\nentered an injunction restraining Contreras and the OIC from\n\nrevoking Plaintiffs' license pending completion of a full and fair\n\nhearing on Plaintiffs' challenge to the revocation order.            In its\n\norder, the district court also concluded that Contreras was not\n\nentitled to qualified immunity.         Contreras filed an interlocutory\n\nappeal challenging the preliminary injunction.\n\n           Shortly    thereafter,      Contreras   moved   to   dismiss   the\n\nfederal lawsuit on qualified immunity grounds.             The court denied\n\nthe motion, reaffirming its prior conclusions.              Contreras then\n\nfiled a second interlocutory appeal challenging this decision. The\n\ntwo interlocutory appeals were consolidated and in a per curiam\n\ndecision, this court affirmed the district court's conclusion that\n\nContreras was not entitled to qualified immunity on the due process\n\nclaim.   161 Fed. Appx. 24 (1st Cir. 2005).2\n\n           The OIC held an administrative hearing on March 4, 2005.\n\nThereafter,   the    new   Insurance    Commissioner,   Dorelisse   Juarbe,\n\nissued a resolution finding that Plaintiffs had violated the\n\nInsurance Code, but revising the sanctions as follows: The fine of\n\n\n2\n   We explicitly noted that \"Contreras only challenge[d] the due\nprocess portion of [Plaintiffs'] complaint.\" 161 Fed. Appx. at 28\nn.8.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fover $2,035,000 was reduced to $208,000; the five-year license\n\nsuspension was reduced to three months; the prohibition of filing\n\nfor a license within five years was eliminated; and the references\n\nwithin Contreras's order as to Guillemard's \"untrustworthiness\" and\n\n\"incompetence\" were omitted.\n\n            Back in the district court, Plaintiffs again amended\n\ntheir    complaint   to   add    Juarbe   as    a   defendant.        The   parties\n\nsubsequently filed cross-motions.              Plaintiffs moved for partial\n\nsummary judgment, arguing that Contreras violated their due process\n\nrights.      Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that\n\nPlaintiffs    had    failed     to   establish      violations   of    the   First\n\nAmendment, the Due Process Clause, or the Equal Protection Clause,\n\nand that Contreras and Juarbe were entitled to qualified immunity\n\non the due process claim.\n\n            The district court referred both motions to a magistrate\n\njudge.    In a report and recommendation (the \"R&R\"), the magistrate\n\njudge recommended that Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary\n\njudgment be denied, and Defendants' motion for summary judgment be\n\ngranted as to the equal protection claim and denied as to the\n\nremaining issues. All parties objected to the R&R. In particular,\n\nDefendants argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity on\n\nall claims.\n\n            The district court adopted the R&R in part and rejected\n\nit in part: it granted Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fjudgment on the due process claim and denied Defendants' motion for\n\nsummary judgment on all claims.    With respect to Defendants' claim\n\nqualified immunity on the due process claim, the district court\n\nheld that Defendants were not entitled to summary judgment because\n\na material issue of fact remained as to the third prong of the\n\nqualified immunity analysis, whether \"a reasonable official in\n\nContreras's   position   would   have   been   justified   in   revoking\n\nplaintiffs' license without a prior hearing.\"         With respect to\n\ntheir assertion of qualified immunity on the other claims, however,\n\nthe district court held that \"[b]ecause the defendants did not\n\nproperly raise these arguments before the Magistrate-Judge, the\n\nCourt will consider their assertion of qualified immunity in\n\nrelation only to the due process claim.\"\n\n          Defendants later filed a motion to vacate the district\n\ncourt's judgment pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b) based on the\n\nnewly discovered evidence of a Puerto Rico appellate court decision\n\nholding that an interpretation that the Insurance Code prohibits\n\ncommission sharing was reasonable.      On April 3, 2006, the district\n\ncourt denied the motion to vacate, finding that the Puerto Rico\n\nappellate court decision was irrelevant to its ruling.\n\n          On August 7, 2006, this Court ruled that Defendants were\n\nentitled to appeal the district court's decision with respect to\n\nqualified immunity on the due process claim, noting that Defendants\n\nhad conceded for purposes of appeal the factual issues the district\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\fcourt had found to be in dispute.        On September 8, 2006, we\n\nmodified the earlier order and ruled that appellate jurisdiction\n\nalso extends to the issue of whether the district court erred in\n\nfinding that Defendants had failed to adequately assert qualified\n\nimmunity with respect to the First Amendment claims.\n\n                          II. Discussion\n\nA. Qualified Immunity on the First Amendment Claims\n\n          We review for abuse of discretion the district court's\n\nconclusion that Defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity\n\non the First Amendment claims of political discrimination and\n\nretaliation because they had failed to adequately assert the\n\nargument before the magistrate judge.3\n\n\n\n3\n    In our September 8, 2006 Order, we extended appellate\njurisdiction to this issue, noting that \"case management orders\nprecluding the assertion of the defense of qualified immunity are\nreviewable, and the circumstances here seem analogous.\" We review\ncase management orders for abuse of discretion. Rosario-Díaz v.\nGonzáles, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n     Although Defendants conceded in their initial brief that the\ndistrict court's ruling was a case management order, they objected\nto that characterization in their reply brief, without suggesting\nan alternative characterization or arguing for a different standard\nof review. Defendants cannot have it both ways. See Waste Mgmt.\nHoldings, Inc. v. Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288, 299 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"We\nhave held, with a regularity bordering on the monotonous, that\nissues advanced for the first time in an appellant's reply brief\nare deemed waived.\"). In any event, we have previously held that\na denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity issues for\nprocedural reasons constitutes a case-management order, see, e.g.,\nTorres v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, No. 06-1771, 2007 WL 996302\nat *4 (1st Cir. Apr. 4, 2007), and we see no reason why the\ndistrict court's ruling in this case should not also fall into this\ncategory.\n\n                               -10-\n\f           Defendants   argue   that     the   district   court   erred    in\n\nrefusing to entertain their arguments on qualified immunity with\n\nrespect to the First Amendment claims.         Specifically, they object\n\nto the holding that \"the defendants did not properly raise these\n\narguments before the Magistrate-Judge.\" Defendants claim that they\n\nraised this defense in their motion for summary judgment when they\n\nargued \"broadly\" that they were entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nDefendants point to three sentences in their motion for summary\n\njudgment   which   purportedly    preserved       their    argument:      (1)\n\n\"[D]efendants herein did not engage in any type of conduct that was\n\nviolative of any of plaintiffs' constitutional rights; hence it is\n\nnot plausible to conclude that defendants' actions were unlawful.\n\nThus, this entitles defendants to qualified immunity,\" Defs.' Mot.\n\nfor Summ. J. 26 (emphasis added); (2) \"Moreover, the application as\n\na matter of law of both the Mt. Healthy and privileged qualified\n\nimmunity defenses warrants summary disposition of all claims at\n\nthis stage of the proceedings,\"    id. at 2 (emphasis added); and (3)\n\n\"Defendants in their personal capacity cannot be held liable in\n\nthis case because they are cloaked by qualified immunity,\" id. at\n\n25.\n\n           Defendants further argue that the specific reference to\n\nMt. Healthy City Board of Education v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 283-284\n\n(1977) (holding that adverse action against a government employee\n\ncannot be taken if it is in response to the employee's \"exercise of\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fconstitutionally protected First Amendment freedoms\"), in their\n\nmotion's discussion of qualified immunity shows that Defendants\n\nasserted a qualified immunity defense to the First Amendment claims\n\nbecause Mt. Healthy is only relevant to the First Amendment.\n\n               Had Defendants raised a qualified immunity defense to the\n\nFirst Amendment claims before the magistrate judge, they would have\n\nbeen   entitled      to   the   district   court's     \"clearly    erroneous    or\n\ncontrary to law\" review of the argument.               See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)\n\n(1)(A).        But    \"issues   adverted   to   in    a    perfunctory   manner,\n\nunaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed\n\nwaived.\"       De Araujo v. González, 457 F.3d 146, 153 (1st 2006)\n\n(quoting United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\nBy Defendants' own admission, their arguments on this point were\n\n\"broad    in    scope,\"    which   means   they      can   just   as   easily   be\n\ncharacterized as \"vague\"; the qualified immunity section of their\n\nsummary judgment motion never even mentioned the words \"First\n\nAmendment,\"      \"political     discrimination,\"      or   \"retaliation.\"       We\n\ncannot say that Defendants' three sentences speaking to qualified\n\nimmunity \"broadly\" and their single reference to Mt. Healthy\n\nsatisfied their duty \"to spell out [their] arguments squarely and\n\ndistinctly.\"         Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec.\n\nCo., 840 F.2d 985, 990 (1st Cir. 1988).           Accordingly, we hold that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that\n\nDefendants waived their qualified immunity defense to the First\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fAmendment claims.   See id. at 990-91 (\"[Fed. R. Civ. P. 72(b)] does\n\nnot permit a litigant to present new initiatives to the district\n\njudge.   We hold categorically that an unsuccessful party is not\n\nentitled as of right to de novo review by the judge of an argument\n\nnever seasonably raised before the magistrate.\"); Borden v. Sec'y\n\nof Health & Human Servs., 836 F.2d 4, 6 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"Appellant\n\nwas entitled to a de novo review by the district court of the\n\n[magistrate judge's] recommendations to which he objected, however\n\nhe was not entitled to a de novo review of an argument never\n\nraised.\" (internal citations omitted)).\n\nB. Qualified Immunity on the Due Process Claim4\n\n\n4\n  Acknowledging that \"courts have held that appellate jurisdiction\ndoes not lie for an order granting partial summary judgment absent\ncertification under [Fed. R. Civ. P. 54],\" Defendants nonetheless\nask us to review the district court's grant of Plaintiffs' motion\nfor partial summary judgment on the due process claims without such\ncertification.\n\n   In the ordinary course, our jurisdiction extends only to appeals\nfrom \"final decisions of the district courts.\" 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\n\"A partial summary judgment order is not a final judgment but is\nmerely a pre-trial adjudication that certain issues are established\nfor trial.\" Alberty-Vélez v. Corporación de Puerto Rico Para La\nDifusión Pública, 361 F.3d 1, 6 n.5 (1st Cir. 2004); see also\nCatlin v. United States, 324 U.S. 229, 233 (1945) (holding that a\ndistrict court's decision is \"final\" if it \"ends the litigation on\nthe merits and leaves nothing for the court to do but execute the\njudgment\"). Defendants have given us no reason to depart from the\nwell-established rule of reviewing only a district court's final\ndecisions. See Manchester Knitted Fashions, Inc. v. Amalgamated\nCotton Garment & Allied Indus. Fund, 967 F.2d 688, 690 (1st Cir.\n1992) (\"It is generally established that in order for an\ninterlocutory order to be appealable, a litigant must . . . show\nthat 'the order of the district court might have a serious, perhaps\nirreparable, consequence, and that the order can be effectually\nchallenged.'\" (quoting Carson v. Am. Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 84\n\n                                -13-\n\f              \"Qualified immunity 'provides a safe harbor for public\n\nofficials acting under the color of state law who would otherwise\n\nbe liable under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for infringing the constitutional\n\nrights of private parties.'\" Borges Colón v. Román-Abreu, 438 F.3d\n\n1, 18 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting Whitfield v. Meléndez-Rivera, 431\n\nF.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2005)).            We apply a three-part test to\n\ndetermine whether a public official is entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity, asking \"(1) whether plaintiff's allegations, if true,\n\nestablish a constitutional violation; (2) whether that right was\n\nclearly established at the time of the alleged violation; and (3)\n\nwhether   a    similarly   situated   reasonable   official    would    have\n\nunderstood that the challenged action violated the constitutional\n\nright at issue.\"     Mihos v. Swift, 358 F.3d 91, 102 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nIf all three questions are answered in the affirmative, we deny\n\nqualified immunity.        Id. at 110.     Defendants argue that, even\n\nassuming the first two prongs are satisfied, they are entitled to\n\nqualified immunity under the third prong of the test because a\n\nsimilarly situated reasonable official would not have believed that\n\nthe   pre-hearing     deprivation     violated   Plaintiffs'   rights     to\n\nprocedural due process.\n\n              We review a district court's denial of summary judgment\n\non qualified immunity grounds de novo, considering only purely\n\n\n(1981)).   Accordingly, we will not review whether the district\ncourt properly granted partial summary judgment on Plaintiffs'\nprocedural due process claim.\n\n                                    -14-\n\flegal questions. Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office, 298 F.3d 81, 90\n\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n            With respect to Contreras, Defendants argue that he is\n\nentitled to qualified immunity because he was acting pursuant to a\n\npresumptively constitutional statute.               Defendants point out that\n\nthe   Puerto    Rico        Insurance    Code   authorizes    the     Insurance\n\nCommissioner to \"suspend, revoke or refuse to renew a license\" by\n\nissuing an \"order . . . to licensee not less than fifteen days\n\nprior to the effective date thereof, subject to the right of the\n\nlicensee to have a hearing,\" and provides that \"pending such\n\nhearing, the license shall be suspended.\"             P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26,\n\n§ 947(2)(a).    Defendants further point out that, as with all state\n\nstatutes,      this     statutory       provision     is   presumed     to   be\n\nconstitutional, see Conn. ex rel Blumenthal v. Crotty, 346 F.3d 84,\n\n102 (2d Cir. 2003), and that no court had, during the relevant time\n\nperiod,     found     the    statute    unconstitutional.        Accordingly,\n\nDefendants argue that even if section 947(2)(a) is now deemed\n\nunconstitutional, Contreras is entitled to qualified immunity for\n\nhis good faith reliance on the presumptively valid provisions of\n\nthe Insurance Code.         See Freeman v. Blair, 862 F.2d 1330, 1332 (8th\n\nCir. 1988) (holding that defendants were entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity where \"any defects in the regulatory scheme were not\n\nsufficiently obvious to make the defendants' reliance on the scheme\n\nobjectively unreasonable\").\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\f           With respect to Juarbe, Defendants argue that she is\n\nentitled to qualified immunity on the due process claim because she\n\ndid not draft or sign the Order, she was not Contreras's supervisor\n\nat the time of the issuance of the Order, and she was not present\n\nduring the conversation in which Contreras allegedly told Rosario\n\nthat he \"would have to carry [out] the investigations against this\n\nN.P.P. member.\" Thus, Defendants argue that there is no connection\n\nbetween Juarbe's conduct and the alleged constitutional violation\n\nof revoking Plaintiffs' licenses without a hearing.               We do not\n\nthink this argument goes to qualified immunity so much as to the\n\nultimate   question   of   liability   under   §   1983,   a   question   not\n\nproperly before us. See Gutiérrez-Rodríguez v. Cartagena, 882 F.2d\n\n553, 560 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"Section 1983 imposes liability upon\n\nthose who 'subject[] or cause[] to be subjected, any citizen of the\n\nUnited States . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges,\n\nor immunities secured by the Constitution and laws . . . .\"\n\n(quoting 42 U.S.C. § 1983) (emphasis added) (other alterations in\n\noriginal)).    In any event, Defendants acknowledge that Juarbe\n\nparticipated in meetings in which the Order was being drafted and\n\nthat she enforced the Order after it was issued.               We think any\n\nreasonable official in Contreras's or Juarbe's situation would have\n\nknown that the summary revocation provision in the Insurance Code\n\nis unconstitutional; therefore, qualified immunity is available to\n\nneither defendant.\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\f          First,      to   the   extent    Contreras    or   Juarbe    acted    in\n\nreliance on section 947(2)(a), enacted in 1957, we find such\n\nreliance unreasonable because that statute is no longer in effect,\n\nhaving been superseded by the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative\n\nProcedure Act, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 2101 et seq. (the \"Puerto\n\nRico APA\").    In Chalkboard, Inc. v. Brandt, 902 F.2d 1357 (9th Cir.\n\n1989), the Ninth Circuit examined a factual scenario very similar\n\nto this case.      There, an agency summarily suspended a day care\n\ncenter's license under a statute that allowed for such suspension\n\nin emergency situations. Id. at 1377-78. However, a later-enacted\n\nstatutory provision required that the agency notify the attorney\n\ngeneral of any emergency circumstances, after which the attorney\n\ngeneral could seek a restraining order.                Id. at 1378-79.         The\n\nChalkboard    court   denied     qualified   immunity,       holding   that    the\n\nsummary closure procedures \"used by defendants in th[at] case could\n\nnot   reasonably      have   been    believed    to     meet    constitutional\n\nrequirements.\"     Id. at 1380-81.        In so holding, the Ninth Circuit\n\nspecifically noted that it could not\n\n          accept the contention that a general purpose\n          summary-closure   provision    enacted   years\n          earlier remains at the disposal of the DHS\n          officials when the state has adopted a more\n          recent and specific statutory scheme which\n          provides for both routine and expedited\n          methods of suspending the license . . . and\n          which does not permit summary action by agency\n          officials.\n\nId. at 1379.\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\f               Neither party disputes that the Puerto Rico APA provides\n\nfor pre-deprivation hearings at all agency levels.              See P.R. Laws\n\nAnn.    tit.    3,   §§   2102-2103,   2151-2170(a);   see   also    Magriz   v.\n\nEmpresas Nativas, Inc., 143 P.R. Dec. 63, 70 (1997).                 Enacted in\n\n1988, it requires all agencies adjudicating a controversy to\n\nsafeguard \"(A) [t]he right to timely notice of the charges or\n\ncomplaints or claims against one of the parties[;] (B) [t]he right\n\nto     introduce     evidence[;]   (C)    [t]he   right   to    an    impartial\n\nadjudication[; and] (D) [t]he right to have the decision based on\n\nthe record of the case.\"        P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 2151(a)(2).          The\n\nSupreme Court of Puerto Rico has held that the Puerto Rico APA\n\nexpressly supersedes any conflicting statutes.               See Hernández v.\n\nGolden Tower Dev. Corp., 125 P.R. Dec. 744, 749 (1990) (\"[I]t is\n\nthe express intent of the lawmaker, in adopting a uniform judicial\n\nreview procedure for rulings or orders of administrative agencies\n\nor departments, that [the Puerto Rico APA] prevail over any other\n\nlegal provision -- appertaining to any agency in particular -- that\n\nmay be repugnant to the provisions of said act.\"); Asociación de\n\nDueños de Casas de la Parguera, Inc. v. Junta de Planificación de\n\nP.R., 148 D.P.R. 307, 314 (1999).         Given the Puerto Rico APA's pre-\n\ndeprivation hearing requirement, any claimed reliance on section\n\n\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\f947's summary-revocation provision is unreasonable as a matter of\n\nlaw.5\n\n            We also find reliance on section 947(2)(a) unreasonable\n\nbecause the statute is patently unconstitutional.              Although state\n\nofficials are ordinarily entitled to rely on presumptively valid\n\nstate statutes, courts have held such reliance unreasonable where\n\nthe relevant law is \"so grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional\n\nthat any person of reasonable prudence would be bound to see its\n\nflaws.\"     Michigan v. DeFillippo, 443 U.S. 31, 38 (1979); See,\n\ne.g., Lawrence v. Reed, 406 F.3d 1224, 1232 (10th Cir. 2005)\n\n(denying    qualified   immunity   to    an   official   who     relied   on   an\n\nordinance allowing for the destruction of derelict automobiles\n\nwithout a hearing because the official could not reasonably have\n\nconcluded that his actions were consistent with due process); Carey\n\nv. Nev. Gaming Control Bd., 279 F.3d 873, 882 (9th Cir. 2002)\n\n(denying qualified immunity to an official who relied on statutes\n\nrequiring    individuals   stopped      pursuant   to    Terry    to   identify\n\nthemselves because \"a reasonable officer in [the defendant's]\n\n\n\n\n5\n   Defendants argue that Contreras's and Juarbe's actions were\nreasonable, even under the Puerto Rico APA, because that statute\nprovides for exceptions to the pre-deprivation hearing requirement.\nSee P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, § 2167. However, the Puerto Rico APA\nprovision authorizing such exceptions provides for \"emergency\nadjudicatory procedures\" only in situations that involve \"imminent\ndanger to the public health, safety and welfare or which requires\nimmediate action by the agency.\" Id. § 2167(a). Defendants do not\nargue that this case involved an emergency situation.\n\n                                   -19-\n\fposition would have known that [the plaintiff] had a clearly\n\nestablished Fourth Amendment right not to identify himself\").\n\n            Section 947(2)(a) is patently unconstitutional because it\n\nspecifically provides for the suspension of a professional license\n\nbefore a hearing is provided, without limitation.      P.R. Laws Ann.\n\ntit. 26, § 947(2)(a).      It has long been established that a state\n\nmay not suspend a professional license without a pre-deprivation\n\nhearing.6   See Beauchamp v. De Abadia, 779 F.2d 773, 775 (1st Cir.\n\n1985) (\"Beauchamp unquestionably had a protected interest in his\n\nlicense to practice medicine.    A clearer example of 'new property'\n\nis not easily imagined.     The district court's holding that he had\n\na right to a hearing before his license could be revoked was\n\ncorrect.\" (internal citations omitted)); see also Mard v. Town of\n\nAmherst, 350 F.3d 184, 192 (1st Cir. 2003)(\"In general, the state\n\nmust provide some kind of hearing before depriving an individual of\n\na   protected   property    interest.\"   (internal   quotation   marks\n\nomitted)).7   Thus, we find that Defendants are not entitled to rely\n\n\n6\n    That \"[a]n important government interest, accompanied by a\nsubstantial assurance that the deprivation is not baseless or\nunwarranted, may in limited cases demanding prompt action justify\npostponing the opportunity to be heard until after the initial\ndeprivation,\" FDIC v. Mallen, 486 U.S. 230, 240 (1988), does not\nchange our conclusion. Section 947 does not limit its application\nto any such circumstances. Moreover, Defendants do not point to\nany special government interest motivating the pre-hearing\ndeprivation described in the Order.\n7\n  Defendants argue that section 947 is not unconstitutional on its\nface because \"it does not preclude a hearing prior to the\nrevocation or refusal to renew a license.\" Appellants' Reply Br.\n\n                                 -20-\n\fon   section   947(2)(a)'s   allowance   for   pre-hearing   deprivations\n\nbecause a reasonable official in their position would have known\n\nthat it violates the Due Process Clause.         Accordingly, we affirm\n\nthe district court's denial of Defendants' motion for summary\n\njudgment.\n\n                        III. Motion to Vacate\n\n            Defendants also argue that the district court erred in\n\ndenying their motion to vacate the summary judgment order.          They\n\nclaim that \"newly discovered evidence\" -- a Puerto Rico appellate\n\ncourt decision finding that an interpretation that the Insurance\n\nCode prohibits commission sharing was reasonable -- shows that\n\nDefendants would have punished Plaintiffs' conduct regardless of\n\ntheir political affiliation.      This argument is a defense against\n\nPlaintiffs' First Amendment political discrimination claim; it has\n\nno effect on the due process claim, which is based solely on the\n\nalleged pre-hearing deprivation.\n\n            We reiterate that this Court may only hear appeals taken\n\nfrom final judgments, see supra note 3.          Accordingly, we do not\n\nhave jurisdiction to review a motion to vacate the district court's\n\ndenial of summary judgment on the political discrimination claim.\n\n\n\n17 (emphasis added). But this misses the point; section 947(a)(2)\nis   unconstitutional  because   it   authorizes   a   pre-hearing\ndeprivation. It should also be noted that Contreras exercised this\nauthority when he issued the Order, which specifically provided\nthat the revocation of Plaintiffs' licenses would be effective\npending any administrative proceedings.\n\n                                  -21-\n\fSee Rivera-Jiménez v. Pierluisi, 362 F.3d 87, 93 (1st Cir. 2004)\n\n(\"[W]e do not have jurisdiction over denials of summary judgment\n\nmotions . . . where a genuine issue of material fact remains in\n\ndispute.\").    Moreover,    as   stated   above,   Defendants   waived   a\n\nqualified immunity defense to the First Amendment claims, see supra\n\nSection II.A, so we have no occasion to opine on that argument.          As\n\nsuch, we take no view of the district court's denial of Defendants'\n\nmotion to vacate.\n\n                             IV. Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ndenial   of   Defendants'    qualified    immunity   claims   on   summary\n\njudgment.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\f",

On November 2, 2001, the Office of the Insurance Commissioner (\"OIC\") assigned Angela Rivera to investigate Urrutia Vall&#233;s, Inc. (\"UVI\"), an insurance brokerage company, for its conduct in connection with the performance of a contract with the government of Puerto Rico. For several years, Lone Star and UVI had worked together in obtaining and servicing property, casualty, and other types of insurance for several government agencies. Pursuant to the investigation, Rivera found that UVI paid commissions to Lone Star from the sale of the government insurance policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 7, 2001, an article in <i>El Nuevo D&#237;a,</i> a Puerto Rico newspaper, reported that the OIC investigation into UVI would also include Guillemard. That same day, Aurea L&#243;pez, the head of the OIC's audit division, instructed Rivera to look for checks from UVI to Lone Star.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 20, 2001, the OIC issued a \"Notification and Examination Order\" calling for an audit of Lone Star's operations and transactions from January 1, 1997 through September 30, 2001. The notice did not allege any wrongdoing. David Castro Anaya, an OIC auditor, was assigned to perform the Lone Star audit. According to Castro, the sole purpose of his investigation was to determine whether improper payments had been made to third parties. Guillemard made available to Castro two Certified Public Accountants to cooperate with the audit and provide all relevant documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By December 17, 2001, all of the documents pertaining to insurance issued to government agencies had been examined and the audit had concluded. Castro informed Guillemard and Miguel Carbonell, Lone Star's CPA, that he found no irregularities or improprieties. Castro also told Guillemard and Carbonell that he would prepare a draft of his final report within the next few months and send them a copy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point after November 20, 2001, but before March 2002, Melvin Rosario, the Director of the Anti-Fraud Unit at the OIC and Castro's supervisor, met privately with Contreras to tell him that he did not wish to investigate Lone Star for commission sharing. He explained that the sharing of commissions, as in the case of Lone Star and UVI, \"was common, normal, in the way that business was conducted. And that [his] opinion in that regard was that [he] had not seen, in all honesty, anything in the Insurance Code indicating that this could not be done that way.\" In response, Contreras told Rosario that he \"would have to carry [out] the investigations against this N.P.P. member\" anyway. Rosario asked to be relieved from the assignment, and Contreras agreed that Castro would report to L&#243;pez instead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in 2002, Guillemard learned that the OIC had issued subpoenas to several Puerto Rico banks demanding account information for all transactions involving Guillemard, Noble, or Lone Star.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 10, 2003, Castro submitted the Final Investigation Findings Report (the \"Report\") relating to the Lone Star audit to his supervisor. He did not send a copy to Guillemard. The Report found no improper payments to third parties, but it raised other issues. In particular, the Report noted that Lone Star had entered into a commission-sharing arrangement with UVI. The Report concluded that the sharing of commissions is a violation of section 939(2) of the Puerto Rico Insurance Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of 2003, Plaintiffs were still being investigated by the OIC. On December 10, 2003, Plaintiffs filed a federal action against Contreras and the OIC, alleging that the investigation was motivated by political animus in violation of their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. At that time, the OIC had not issued any reports or orders in connection with the Lone Star investigation since the submission of Castro's July report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contreras found out about Plaintiffs' lawsuit by the following day.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On December 23, 2003, Contreras issued an order declaring Plaintiffs incompetent and untrustworthy, revoking their insurance licenses for a period of five years; denying them any license in any capacity for a period of five years; and imposing a fine of $2,035,000 (the \"Order\"). The Order stated that it would become effective on January 7, 2004, but provided that Plaintiffs could request an administrative hearing to contest it. The Order also stated that a request for an administrative hearing would stay the imposition of the fine, the declaration that Plaintiffs were incompetent and untrustworthy, and the denial of any license in any capacity. However, pursuant to the Order, the revocation of Plaintiffs' licenses would remain in effect pending a final administrative decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following receipt of the Order, Plaintiffs promptly requested an administrative hearing. They also amended their complaint to allege claims of retaliation under the First Amendment and violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, as well as state law provisions. In addition, Plaintiffs requested a temporary restraining order to prevent the revocation from taking effect, and moved for a preliminary injunction. The district court granted the temporary restraining order and scheduled a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction. After a hearing, at which only Plaintiffs chose to present evidence, the district court entered an injunction restraining Contreras and the OIC from revoking Plaintiffs' license pending completion of a full and fair hearing on Plaintiffs' challenge to the revocation order. In its order, the district court also concluded that Contreras was not entitled to qualified immunity. Contreras filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, Contreras moved to dismiss the federal lawsuit on qualified immunity grounds. The court denied the motion, reaffirming its prior conclusions. Contreras then filed a second interlocutory appeal challenging this decision. The two interlocutory appeals were consolidated and in a <i>per curiam</i> decision, this court affirmed the district court's conclusion that Contreras was not entitled to qualified immunity on the due process claim. 161 Fed.Appx. 24 (1st Cir.2005).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The OIC held an administrative hearing on March 4, 2005. Thereafter, the new Insurance Commissioner, Dorelisse Juarbe, issued a resolution finding that Plaintiffs had violated the Insurance Code, but revising the sanctions as follows: The fine of over $2,035,000 was reduced to $208,000; the five-year license suspension was reduced to three months; the prohibition of filing for a license within five years was eliminated; and the references within Contreras's order as to Guillemard's \"untrustworthiness\" and \"incompetence\" were omitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Back in the district court, Plaintiffs again amended their complaint to add Juarbe as a defendant. The parties subsequently filed cross-motions. Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that Contreras violated their due process rights. Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that Plaintiffs had failed to establish violations of the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, or the Equal Protection Clause, and that Contreras and Juarbe were entitled to qualified immunity on the due process claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court referred both motions to a magistrate judge. In a report and recommendation (the \"R &amp; R\"), the magistrate judge recommended that Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment be denied, and Defendants' motion for summary judgment be granted as to the equal protection claim and denied as to the remaining issues. All parties objected to the R &amp; R. In particular, Defendants argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity on all claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the R &amp; R in part and rejected it in part: it granted Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on the due process claim and denied Defendants' motion for summary judgment on all claims. With respect to Defendants' claim qualified immunity on the due process claim, the district court held that Defendants were not entitled to summary judgment because a material issue of fact remained as to the third prong of the qualified immunity analysis, whether \"a reasonable official in Contreras's position would have been justified in revoking plaintiffs' license without a prior hearing.\" With respect to their assertion of qualified immunity on the other claims, however, the district court held that \"[b]ecause the defendants did not properly raise these arguments before the Magistrate-Judge, the Court will consider their assertion of qualified immunity in relation only to the due process claim.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants later filed a motion to vacate the district court's judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) based on the newly discovered evidence of a Puerto Rico appellate court decision holding that an interpretation that the Insurance Code prohibits commission sharing was reasonable. On April 3, 2006, the district court denied the motion to vacate, finding that the Puerto Rico appellate court decision was irrelevant to its ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 7, 2006, this Court ruled that Defendants were entitled to appeal the district court's decision with respect to qualified immunity on the due process claim, noting that Defendants had conceded for purposes of appeal the factual issues the district court had found to be in dispute. On September 8, 2006, we modified the earlier order and ruled that appellate jurisdiction also extends to the issue of whether the district court erred in finding that Defendants had failed to adequately assert qualified immunity with respect to the First Amendment claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>A.

Specifically, they object to the holding that \"the defendants did not properly raise these arguments before the Magistrate-Judge.\" Defendants claim that they raised this defense in their motion for summary judgment when they argued \"broadly\" that they were entitled to qualified immunity. Defendants point to three sentences in their motion for summary judgment which purportedly preserved their argument: (1) \"[D]efendants herein did not engage in any type of conduct that was violative of <i>any</i> of plaintiffs' constitutional rights; hence it is not plausible to conclude that defendants' actions were unlawful. Thus, this entitles defendants to qualified immunity,\" Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. 26 (emphasis added); (2) \"Moreover, the application as a matter of law of both the <i>Mt. Healthy</i> and privileged qualified immunity defenses warrants summary disposition of <i>all claims</i> at this stage of the proceedings,\" <i>id.</i> at 2 (emphasis added); and (3) \"Defendants in their personal capacity cannot be held liable in this case because they are cloaked by qualified immunity,\" <i>id.</i> at 25.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants further argue that the specific reference to <i>Mt. Healthy City Board of Education v. Doyle,</i> 429 U.S. 274, 283-284, 97 S.Ct. 568, 50 L.Ed.2d 471 (1977) (holding that adverse action against a government employee cannot be taken if it is in response to the employee's \"exercise of constitutionally protected First Amendment freedoms\"), in their motion's discussion of qualified immunity shows that Defendants asserted a qualified immunity defense to the First Amendment claims because <i>Mt. Healthy</i> is only relevant to the First Amendment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had Defendants raised a qualified immunity defense to the First Amendment claims before the magistrate judge, they would have been entitled to the district court's \"clearly erroneous or contrary to law\" review of the argument. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 636(b)(1)(A). But \"issues adverted to in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at developed argumentation, are deemed waived.\" <i>De Araujo v. Gonz&#225;les,</i> 457 F.3d 146, 153 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990)). By Defendants' own admission, their arguments on this point were \"broad in scope,\" which means they can just as easily be characterized as \"vague\"; the qualified immunity section of their summary judgment motion never even mentioned the words \"First Amendment,\" \"political discrimination,\" or \"retaliation.\" We cannot say that Defendants' three sentences speaking to qualified immunity \"broadly\" and their single reference to <i>Mt. Healthy</i> satisfied their duty \"to spell out [their] arguments squarely and distinctly.\" <i>Paterson-Leitch Co. v. Mass. Mun. Wholesale Elec. Co.,</i> 840 F.2d 985, 990 (1st Cir.1988). Accordingly, we hold that the district court did not abuse its discretion in holding that Defendants waived their qualified immunity defense to the First Amendment claims. <i>See id.</i> at 990-91 (\"[Fed.R.Civ.P. 72(b)] does not permit a litigant to present new initiatives to the district judge. We hold categorically that an unsuccessful party is not entitled as of right to de novo review by the judge of an argument never seasonably raised before the magistrate.\"); <i>Borden v.

We apply a three-part test to determine whether a public official is entitled to qualified immunity, asking \"(1) whether plaintiff's allegations, if true, establish a constitutional violation; (2) whether that right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation; and (3) whether a similarly situated reasonable official would have understood that the challenged action violated the constitutional right at issue.\" <i>Mihos v. Swift,</i> 358 F.3d 91, 102 (1st Cir.2004). If all three questions are answered in the affirmative, we deny qualified immunity. <i>Id.</i> at 110. Defendants argue that, even assuming the first two prongs are satisfied, they are entitled to qualified immunity under the third prong of the test because a similarly situated reasonable official would not have believed that the pre-hearing deprivation violated Plaintiffs' rights to procedural due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds <i>de novo,</i> considering only purely legal questions. <i>Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office,</i> 298 F.3d 81, 90 (1st Cir. 2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Contreras, Defendants argue that he is entitled to qualified immunity because he was acting pursuant to a presumptively constitutional statute. Defendants point out that the Puerto Rico Insurance Code authorizes the Insurance Commissioner to \"suspend, revoke or refuse to renew a license\" by issuing an \"order . . . to licensee not less than fifteen days prior to the effective date thereof, subject to the right of the licensee to have a hearing,\" and provides that \"pending such hearing, the license shall be suspended.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 947(2)(a). Defendants further point out that, as with all state statutes, this statutory provision is presumed to be constitutional, <i>see Conn. ex rel Blumenthal v. Crotty,</i> 346 F.3d 84, 102 (2d Cir.2003), and that no court had, during the relevant time period, found the statute unconstitutional. Accordingly, Defendants argue that even if section 947(2)(a) is now deemed unconstitutional, Contreras is entitled to qualified immunity for his good faith reliance on the presumptively valid provisions of the Insurance Code. <i>See Freeman v. Blair,</i> 862 F.2d 1330, 1332 (8th Cir.1988) (holding that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity where \"any defects in the regulatory scheme were not sufficiently obvious to make the defendants' reliance on the scheme objectively unreasonable\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Juarbe, Defendants argue that she is entitled to qualified immunity on the due process claim because she did not draft or sign the Order, she was not Contreras's supervisor at the time of the issuance of the Order, and she was not present during the conversation in which Contreras allegedly told Rosario that he \"would have to carry [out] the investigations against this N.P.P. member.\" Thus, Defendants argue that there is no connection between Juarbe's conduct and the alleged constitutional violation of revoking Plaintiffs' licenses without a hearing. We do not think this argument goes to qualified immunity so much as to the ultimate question of liability under &#167; 1983, a question not properly before us. <i>See Guti&#233;rrez-Rodr&#237;guez v. Cartagena,</i> 882 F.2d 553, 560 (1st Cir.1989) (\"Section 1983 imposes liability upon those who `<i>subject[] or cause[] to be subjected,</i>' any citizen of the United States . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws . . . .\" (quoting 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983) (emphasis added) (other alterations in original)). In any event, Defendants acknowledge that Juarbe participated in meetings in which the Order was being drafted and that she enforced the Order after it was issued. We think any reasonable official in Contreras's or Juarbe's situation would have known that the summary revocation provision in the Insurance Code is unconstitutional; therefore, qualified immunity is available to neither defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, to the extent Contreras or Juarbe acted in reliance on section 947(2)(a), enacted in 1957, we find such reliance unreasonable because that statute is no longer in effect, having been superseded by the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 2101 <i>et seq.</i> (the \"Puerto Rico APA\"). In <i>Chalkboard, Inc. v. Brandt,</i> 902 F.2d 1375 (9th Cir.1989), the Ninth Circuit examined a factual scenario very similar to this case. There, an agency summarily suspended a day care center's license under a statute that allowed for such suspension in emergency situations. <i>Id.</i> at 1377-78. However, a later-enacted statutory provision required that the agency notify the attorney general of any emergency circumstances, after which the attorney general could seek a restraining order. <i>Id.</i> at 1378-79. The <i>Chalkboard</i> court denied qualified immunity, holding that the summary closure procedures \"used by defendants in th[at] case could not reasonably have been believed to meet constitutional requirements.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1380-81. In so holding, the Ninth Circuit specifically noted that it could not</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">accept the contention that a general purpose summary-closure provision enacted years earlier remains at the disposal of the DHS officials when the state has adopted a more recent and specific statutory scheme which provides for both routine and expedited methods of suspending the license . . . and which does not permit summary action by agency officials.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 1379.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither party disputes that the Puerto Rico APA provides for pre-deprivation hearings at all agency levels. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167;&#167; 2102-2103, 2151-2170(a); <i>see also Magriz v. Empresas Nativas, Inc.,</i> 143 P.R. Dec. 63, 70 (1997). Enacted in 1988, it requires all agencies adjudicating a controversy to safeguard \"(A) [t]he right to timely notice of the charges or complaints or claims against one of the parties[;] (B) [t]he right to introduce evidence[;] (C) [t]he right to an impartial adjudication[; and] (D) [t]he right to have the decision based on the record of the case.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 2151(a)(2). The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has held that the Puerto Rico APA expressly supersedes any conflicting statutes. <i>See Hern&#225;ndez v. Golden Tower Dev. Corp.,</i> 125 P.R. Dec. 744, 749 (1990) (\"[I]t is the express intent of the lawmaker, in adopting a uniform judicial review procedure for rulings or orders of administrative agencies or departments, that [the Puerto Rico APA] prevail over any other legal provision&#8212;appertaining to any agency in particular&#8212;that may be repugnant to the provisions of said act.\"); <i>Asociaci&#243;n de Due&#241;os de Casas de la Parguera, Inc. v. Junta de Planificaci&#243;n de P.R.,</i> 148 D.P.R. 307, 314 (1999). Given the Puerto Rico APA's pre-deprivation hearing requirement, any claimed reliance on section 947's summary-revocation provision is unreasonable as a matter of law.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also find reliance on section 947(2)(a) unreasonable because the statute is patently unconstitutional. Although state officials are ordinarily entitled to rely on presumptively valid state statutes, courts have held such reliance unreasonable where the relevant law is \"so grossly and flagrantly unconstitutional that any person of reasonable prudence would be bound to see its flaws.\" <i>Michigan v. DeFillippo,</i> 443 U.S. 31, 38, 99 S.Ct. 2627, 61 L.Ed.2d 343 (1979); <i>See, e.g., Lawrence v.

Nev. Gaming Control Bd.,</i> 279 F.3d 873, 882 (9th Cir.2002) (denying qualified immunity to an official who relied on statutes requiring individuals stopped pursuant to <i>Terry</i> to identify themselves because \"a reasonable officer in [the defendant's] position would have known that [the plaintiff] had a clearly established Fourth Amendment right not to identify himself\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 947(2)(a) is patently unconstitutional because it specifically provides for the suspension of a professional license before a hearing is provided, without limitation. P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 947(2)(a). It has long been established that a state may not suspend a professional license without a pre-deprivation hearing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Beauchamp v. De Abadia,</i> 779 F.2d 773, 775 (1st Cir.1985) (\"Beauchamp unquestionably had a protected interest in his license to practice medicine. A clearer example of `new property' is not easily imagined.

Town of Amherst,</i> 350 F.3d 184, 192 (1st Cir.2003)(\"In general, the state must provide some kind of hearing before depriving an individual of a protected property interest.\" (internal quotation marks omitted)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Thus, we find that Defendants are not entitled to rely on section 947(2)(a)'s allowance for pre-hearing deprivations because a reasonable official in their position would have known that it violates the Due Process Clause. Accordingly, we affirm the district court's denial of Defendants' motion for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">III. <i>Motion to Vacate</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants also argue that the district court erred in denying their motion to vacate the summary judgment order. They claim that \"newly discovered evidence\" &#8212; a Puerto Rico appellate court decision finding that an interpretation that the Insurance Code prohibits commission sharing was reasonable &#8212; shows that Defendants would have punished Plaintiffs' conduct regardless of their political affiliation. This argument is a defense against Plaintiffs' First Amendment political discrimination claim; it has no effect on the due process claim, which is based solely on the alleged pre-hearing deprivation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reiterate that this Court may only hear appeals taken from final judgments, <i>see supra</i> note 4. Accordingly, we do not have jurisdiction to review a motion to vacate the district court's denial of summary judgment on the political discrimination claim. <i>See Rivera-Jim&#233;nez v. Pierluisi,</i> 362 F.3d 87, 93 (1st Cir.2004) (\"[W]e do not have jurisdiction over denials of summary judgment motions ... where a genuine issue of material fact remains in dispute.\"). Moreover, as stated above, Defendants waived a qualified immunity defense to the First Amendment claims, <i>see supra</i> Section II.A, so we have no occasion to opine on that argument. As such, we take no view of the district court's denial of Defendants' motion to vacate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">IV. <i>Conclusion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of Defendants' qualified immunity claims on summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> By this time, Contreras had submitted his resignation as Insurance Commissioner, effective at the end of December</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> We explicitly noted that \"Contreras only challenge[d] the due process portion of [Plaintiffs'] complaint.\" 161 Fed.Appx. at 28 n. 8</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In our September 8, 2006 Order, we extended appellate jurisdiction to this issue, noting that \"case management orders precluding the assertion of the defense of qualified immunity are reviewable, and the circumstances here seem analogous.\" We review case management orders for abuse of discretion<i>Rosario-D&#237;az v.

Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment on their due process claim and Defendants moved for summary judgment on all claims. The district court granted Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment and denied Defendants' motion. Defendants now appeal. In addition, Defendants also take this opportunity to appeal the district court's denial of their motion to vacate the court's judgment under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) based on newly discovered evidence. After careful consideration, we affirm the district court's denial of qualified immunity and dismiss any appeal taken from the court's grant of partial summary judgment or its denial of the motion to vacate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">I. <i>Factual and Procedural Background</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Guillemard and Noble founded Lone Star Insurance Producers in 1984. Both are well-known members of the New Progressive Party (\"NPP\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in 2001, Contreras became the Insurance Commissioner for Puerto Rico. On November 2, 2001, the Office of the Insurance Commissioner (\"OIC\") assigned Angela Rivera to investigate Urrutia Vall&#233;s, Inc. (\"UVI\"), an insurance brokerage company, for its conduct in connection with the performance of a contract with the government of Puerto Rico. For several years, Lone Star and UVI had worked together in obtaining and servicing property, casualty, and other types of insurance for several government agencies. Pursuant to the investigation, Rivera found that UVI paid commissions to Lone Star from the sale of the government insurance policies.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 7, 2001, an article in <i>El Nuevo D&#237;a,</i> a Puerto Rico newspaper, reported that the OIC investigation into UVI would also include Guillemard. That same day, Aurea L&#243;pez, the head of the OIC's audit division, instructed Rivera to look for checks from UVI to Lone Star.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 20, 2001, the OIC issued a \"Notification and Examination Order\" calling for an audit of Lone Star's operations and transactions from January 1, 1997 through September 30, 2001. The notice did not allege any wrongdoing. David Castro Anaya, an OIC auditor, was assigned to perform the Lone Star audit. According to Castro, the sole purpose of his investigation was to determine whether improper payments had been made to third parties. Guillemard made available to Castro two Certified Public Accountants to cooperate with the audit and provide all relevant documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By December 17, 2001, all of the documents pertaining to insurance issued to government agencies had been examined and the audit had concluded. Castro informed Guillemard and Miguel Carbonell, Lone Star's CPA, that he found no irregularities or improprieties. Castro also told Guillemard and Carbonell that he would prepare a draft of his final report within the next few months and send them a copy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At some point after November 20, 2001, but before March 2002, Melvin Rosario, the Director of the Anti-Fraud Unit at the OIC and Castro's supervisor, met privately with Contreras to tell him that he did not wish to investigate Lone Star for commission sharing. He explained that the sharing of commissions, as in the case of Lone Star and UVI, \"was common, normal, in the way that business was conducted. And that [his] opinion in that regard was that [he] had not seen, in all honesty, anything in the Insurance Code indicating that this could not be done that way.\" In response, Contreras told Rosario that he \"would have to carry [out] the investigations against this N.P.P. member\" anyway. Rosario asked to be relieved from the assignment, and Contreras agreed that Castro would report to L&#243;pez instead.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in 2002, Guillemard learned that the OIC had issued subpoenas to several Puerto Rico banks demanding account information for all transactions involving Guillemard, Noble, or Lone Star.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 10, 2003, Castro submitted the Final Investigation Findings Report (the \"Report\") relating to the Lone Star audit to his supervisor. He did not send a copy to Guillemard. The Report found no improper payments to third parties, but it raised other issues. In particular, the Report noted that Lone Star had entered into a commission-sharing arrangement with UVI. The Report concluded that the sharing of commissions is a violation of section 939(2) of the Puerto Rico Insurance Code.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of 2003, Plaintiffs were still being investigated by the OIC. On December 10, 2003, Plaintiffs filed a federal action against Contreras and the OIC, alleging that the investigation was motivated by political animus in violation of their rights under the First and Fourteenth Amendments. At that time, the OIC had not issued any reports or orders in connection with the Lone Star investigation since the submission of Castro's July report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contreras found out about Plaintiffs' lawsuit by the following day.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> On December 23, 2003, Contreras issued an order declaring Plaintiffs incompetent and untrustworthy, revoking their insurance licenses for a period of five years; denying them any license in any capacity for a period of five years; and imposing a fine of $2,035,000 (the \"Order\"). The Order stated that it would become effective on January 7, 2004, but provided that Plaintiffs could request an administrative hearing to contest it. The Order also stated that a request for an administrative hearing would stay the imposition of the fine, the declaration that Plaintiffs were incompetent and untrustworthy, and the denial of any license in any capacity. However, pursuant to the Order, the revocation of Plaintiffs' licenses would remain in effect pending a final administrative decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following receipt of the Order, Plaintiffs promptly requested an administrative hearing. They also amended their complaint to allege claims of retaliation under the First Amendment and violation of the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, as well as state law provisions. In addition, Plaintiffs requested a temporary restraining order to prevent the revocation from taking effect, and moved for a preliminary injunction. The district court granted the temporary restraining order and scheduled a hearing on the motion for a preliminary injunction. After a hearing, at which only Plaintiffs chose to present evidence, the district court entered an injunction restraining Contreras and the OIC from revoking Plaintiffs' license pending completion of a full and fair hearing on Plaintiffs' challenge to the revocation order. In its order, the district court also concluded that Contreras was not entitled to qualified immunity. Contreras filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the preliminary injunction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly thereafter, Contreras moved to dismiss the federal lawsuit on qualified immunity grounds. The court denied the motion, reaffirming its prior conclusions. Contreras then filed a second interlocutory appeal challenging this decision. The two interlocutory appeals were consolidated and in a <i>per curiam</i> decision, this court affirmed the district court's conclusion that Contreras was not entitled to qualified immunity on the due process claim. 161 Fed.Appx. 24 (1st Cir.2005).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The OIC held an administrative hearing on March 4, 2005. Thereafter, the new Insurance Commissioner, Dorelisse Juarbe, issued a resolution finding that Plaintiffs had violated the Insurance Code, but revising the sanctions as follows: The fine of over $2,035,000 was reduced to $208,000; the five-year license suspension was reduced to three months; the prohibition of filing for a license within five years was eliminated; and the references within Contreras's order as to Guillemard's \"untrustworthiness\" and \"incompetence\" were omitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Back in the district court, Plaintiffs again amended their complaint to add Juarbe as a defendant. The parties subsequently filed cross-motions. Plaintiffs moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that Contreras violated their due process rights. Defendants moved for summary judgment, arguing that Plaintiffs had failed to establish violations of the First Amendment, the Due Process Clause, or the Equal Protection Clause, and that Contreras and Juarbe were entitled to qualified immunity on the due process claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court referred both motions to a magistrate judge. In a report and recommendation (the \"R &amp; R\"), the magistrate judge recommended that Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment be denied, and Defendants' motion for summary judgment be granted as to the equal protection claim and denied as to the remaining issues. All parties objected to the R &amp; R. In particular, Defendants argued that they were entitled to qualified immunity on all claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court adopted the R &amp; R in part and rejected it in part: it granted Plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment on the due process claim and denied Defendants' motion for summary judgment on all claims. With respect to Defendants' claim qualified immunity on the due process claim, the district court held that Defendants were not entitled to summary judgment because a material issue of fact remained as to the third prong of the qualified immunity analysis, whether \"a reasonable official in Contreras's position would have been justified in revoking plaintiffs' license without a prior hearing.\" With respect to their assertion of qualified immunity on the other claims, however, the district court held that \"[b]ecause the defendants did not properly raise these arguments before the Magistrate-Judge, the Court will consider their assertion of qualified immunity in relation only to the due process claim.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendants later filed a motion to vacate the district court's judgment pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) based on the newly discovered evidence of a Puerto Rico appellate court decision holding that an interpretation that the Insurance Code prohibits commission sharing was reasonable. On April 3, 2006, the district court denied the motion to vacate, finding that the Puerto Rico appellate court decision was irrelevant to its ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 7, 2006, this Court ruled that Defendants were entitled to appeal the district court's decision with respect to qualified immunity on the due process claim, noting that Defendants had conceded for purposes of appeal the factual issues the district court had found to be in dispute. On September 8, 2006, we modified the earlier order and ruled that appellate jurisdiction also extends to the issue of whether the district court erred in finding that Defendants had failed to adequately assert qualified immunity with respect to the First Amendment claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>A.

Specifically, they object to the holding that \"the defendants did not properly raise these arguments before the Magistrate-Judge.\" Defendants claim that they raised this defense in their motion for summary judgment when they argued \"broadly\" that they were entitled to qualified immunity. Defendants point to three sentences in their motion for summary judgment which purportedly preserved their argument: (1) \"[D]efendants herein did not engage in any type of conduct that was violative of <i>any</i> of plaintiffs' constitutional rights; hence it is not plausible to conclude that defendants' actions were unlawful. Thus, this entitles defendants to qualified immunity,\" Defs.' Mot. for Summ. J. 26 (emphasis added); (2) \"Moreover, the application as a matter of law of both the <i>Mt.

By Defendants' own admission, their arguments on this point were \"broad in scope,\" which means they can just as easily be characterized as \"vague\"; the qualified immunity section of their summary judgment motion never even mentioned the words \"First Amendment,\" \"political discrimination,\" or \"retaliation.\" We cannot say that Defendants' three sentences speaking to qualified immunity \"broadly\" and their single reference to <i>Mt.

Defendants argue that, even assuming the first two prongs are satisfied, they are entitled to qualified immunity under the third prong of the test because a similarly situated reasonable official would not have believed that the pre-hearing deprivation violated Plaintiffs' rights to procedural due process.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review a district court's denial of summary judgment on qualified immunity grounds <i>de novo,</i> considering only purely legal questions. <i>Suboh v. Dist. Attorney's Office,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">298</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></span>, 90 (1st Cir. 2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Contreras, Defendants argue that he is entitled to qualified immunity because he was acting pursuant to a presumptively constitutional statute. Defendants point out that the Puerto Rico Insurance Code authorizes the Insurance Commissioner to \"suspend, revoke or refuse to renew a license\" by issuing an \"order . . . to licensee not less than fifteen days prior to the effective date thereof, subject to the right of the licensee to have a hearing,\" and provides that \"pending such hearing, the license shall be suspended.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, &#167; 947(2)(a). Defendants further point out that, as with all state statutes, this statutory provision is presumed to be constitutional, <i>see Conn. ex rel Blumenthal v. Crotty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783814\"><a href=\"/opinion/783814/state-of-connecticut-on-the-relation-of-richard-blumenthal-in-his-capacity/\"><span class=\"volume\">346</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">84</span></a></span>, 102 (2d Cir.2003), and that no court had, during the relevant time period, found the statute unconstitutional. Accordingly, Defendants argue that even if section 947(2)(a) is now deemed unconstitutional, Contreras is entitled to qualified immunity for his good faith reliance on the presumptively valid provisions of the Insurance Code. <i>See Freeman v. Blair,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"515500\"><a href=\"/opinion/515500/glenn-t-freeman-and-lucy-e-freeman-individually-and-dba-belvidere-east/\"><span class=\"volume\">862</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1330</span></a></span>, 1332 (8th Cir.1988) (holding that defendants were entitled to qualified immunity where \"any defects in the regulatory scheme were not sufficiently obvious to make the defendants' reliance on the scheme objectively unreasonable\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With respect to Juarbe, Defendants argue that she is entitled to qualified immunity on the due process claim because she did not draft or sign the Order, she was not Contreras's supervisor at the time of the issuance of the Order, and she was not present during the conversation in which Contreras allegedly told Rosario that he \"would have to carry [out] the investigations against this N.P.P. member.\" Thus, Defendants argue that there is no connection between Juarbe's conduct and the alleged constitutional violation of revoking Plaintiffs' licenses without a hearing. We do not think this argument goes to qualified immunity so much as to the ultimate question of liability under &#167; 1983, a question not properly before us. <i>See Guti&#233;rrez-Rodr&#237;guez v. Cartagena,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"527780\"><a href=\"/opinion/527780/carlos-a-gutierrez-rodriguez-v-desiderio-cartagena-and-domingo-alvarez/\"><span class=\"volume\">882</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">553</span></a></span>, 560 (1st Cir.1989) (\"Section 1983 imposes liability upon those who `<i>subject[] or cause[] to be subjected,</i>' any citizen of the United States . . . to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws . . . .\" (quoting 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983) (emphasis added) (other alterations in original)). In any event, Defendants acknowledge that Juarbe participated in meetings in which the Order was being drafted and that she enforced the Order after it was issued. We think any reasonable official in Contreras's or Juarbe's situation would have known that the summary revocation provision in the Insurance Code is unconstitutional; therefore, qualified immunity is available to neither defendant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, to the extent Contreras or Juarbe acted in reliance on section 947(2)(a), enacted in 1957, we find such reliance unreasonable because that statute is no longer in effect, having been superseded by the Puerto Rico Uniform Administrative Procedure Act, P.R.

There, an agency summarily suspended a day care center's license under a statute that allowed for such suspension in emergency situations. <i>Id.</i> at 1377-78. However, a later-enacted statutory provision required that the agency notify the attorney general of any emergency circumstances, after which the attorney general could seek a restraining order. <i>Id.</i> at 1378-79. The <i>Chalkboard</i> court denied qualified immunity, holding that the summary closure procedures \"used by defendants in th[at] case could not reasonably have been believed to meet constitutional requirements.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1380-81.

Laws Ann. tit. 3, &#167; 2151(a)(2). The Supreme Court of Puerto Rico has held that the Puerto Rico APA expressly supersedes any conflicting statutes. <i>See Hern&#225;ndez v. Golden Tower Dev.
