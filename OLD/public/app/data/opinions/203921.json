The\npetitions challenged the panel's ruling on the issue of primary liability under Rule 10b-5(b), which\nwas based on an implied statement theory; they also challenged the panel's ruling on the Section\n17(a)(2) claim. Tambone further argued that the panel's decision on the issue of aiding and abetting\nliability was erroneous because it depended on the panel's Rule 10b-5(b) primary liability holding.\n\n        A majority of the active judges of this court have voted to grant rehearing en banc on the\nRule 10b-5(b) issues. Judges Lipez and Torruella dissent from the grant of en banc review. The\npetitions are denied as to review of the panel's Section 17(a)(2) ruling. In accordance with customary\npractice, the opinion released on December 3, 2008 is withdrawn, and the judgment entered on the\nsame date is vacated. See 1st Cir. I.O.P. X(D).\n\n         The parties are permitted, if they wish, to file simultaneous supplemental briefs limited to\nthe Rule 10b-5(b) issues. The court will not accept further briefing or argument on any other\nissues. Any supplemental briefs shall not exceed 30 pages, shall be in the form required by this\ncourt's local rules, and shall be filed on or before September 4, 2009.\n\n       The court also solicits amicus briefs limited to the Rule 10b-5(b) issues. Motions for\n\fleave to file amicus briefs from those who have not already filed briefs must be filed with\nattached brief, limited to 15 pages, by September 4, 2009.\n\n        Fourteen copies of any supplemental brief or original amicus brief should be provided,\nincluding one copy in PDF format on a disk.
