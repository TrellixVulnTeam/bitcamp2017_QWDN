We affirm.\n\n                                    I.\n\n              Kalitani entered the United States on September 8, 1998,\n\nostensibly as a visitor for pleasure.        After overstaying her visa,\n\nshe applied for asylum in August 1999 and received an interview\n\nwith an asylum officer, who recommended against granting asylum.\n\nThe INS began removal proceedings against Kalitani on March 6,\n\n2000.

The\n\nImmigration Judge (\"IJ\") held a hearing on the merits of Kalitani's\n\ncase on February 12, 2001, and on the same day issued an oral\n\nopinion denying her petition.         The Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(\"BIA\") issued a summary affirmance without opinion on September\n\n27, 2002.      See 8 C.F.R. ยง 1003.1(a)(7) (2003)(formerly 8 C.F.R.\n\nยง 3.1(e)(4)).      This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel,\nInhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465\nU.N.T.S. 85. See generally Mediouni v. INS, 314 F.3d 24, 26 n.2\n(1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                    -2-\n\f           Kalitani's asylum application and hearing testimony tell\n\na dramatic and harrowing story.       She testified that if she returns\n\nto Uganda, she will be killed by the government.                Kalitani said\n\nthat her father, Wasswa Henry Kabazzi, was a former rebel turned\n\nhigh-ranking military officer in Uganda when, in August 1995,\n\nsoldiers abducted him from the family home.            The soldiers claimed\n\nhe was plotting to overthrow the government (which was controlled\n\nby the National Resistance Army).           Soldiers burst into the house\n\nagain at three o'clock in the morning on the same night.                   They\n\nsearched   for   papers   and   weapons,     beating   family    members    who\n\ndisclaimed   knowledge    of    Kabazzi's    activities.     Kalitani,     her\n\nmother, and her siblings fled to Kalitani's grandmother's home in\n\nanother village, where they stayed for two weeks until soldiers\n\ndiscovered them hiding there.        As the soldiers came in the front\n\ndoor of the house, Kalitani and her brother ran out the back.              They\n\ntook refuge in the forest and hid there for five days, unaware of\n\nwhat happened to the rest of the family.           When they emerged from\n\nthe woods, they took shelter briefly with a local priest and then\n\nsought protection from a group of rebels who were friends of their\n\nfather.    The rebels were members of the Lord's Resistance Army,\n\nknown as the LRA.\n\n           Kalitani and her brother eventually decided to join the\n\nLRA.   She lived at one of their training camps for over a year and\n\na half, and belonged to the group for about two years in total.              As\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fa woman, she said, she was made to cook for the rebels and help\n\nwith work around the camp.        She also participated in some of the\n\ngroup's more dangerous activities.          Three times, Kalitani was sent\n\nto spy on government barracks.        In addition, she was trained to use\n\nweapons, including an AK-47 assault rifle.           When she left the camp\n\nin the spring of 1997, armed with an AK-47, she received a\n\n\"serious\" mission: to raid government barracks and set free a\n\nnumber of rebel prisoners.            There was a firefight during the\n\nmission and Kalitani fired on government soldiers, although she\n\ninsisted that she did not kill anyone.           She testified that she and\n\nher brother were captured after the firefight, beaten and tortured\n\nby soldiers of the National Resistance Army, and held prisoner in\n\nan underground room for over four months.            During that time, the\n\nsoldiers would periodically choose prisoners to execute.                   She\n\nwatched the soldiers execute her brother by firing squad.\n\n           Eventually, Kalitani managed to escape and she fled into\n\nthe forest.    A pair of strangers rescued her and delivered her to\n\nthe home of a friend, where she learned that her sister and\n\ngrandmother had been killed.          There was no news of her mother and\n\nother sister.    She stayed with her friend for nine months.             Then,\n\nby bribing border officials, Kalitani made her way into Kenya,\n\nwhere she boarded a plane and traveled to the United States via\n\nSwitzerland and Denmark.        She used a Ugandan passport and a U.S.\n\nentry   visa   obtained   for   her    by   a   person   whom   she   variously\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fdescribed as a friend of her father and as the father of a friend.\n\nShe was unwilling or unable to say how this person obtained the\n\npassport or acquired the visa; Kalitani never personally visited an\n\nAmerican consulate or embassy.          When Kalitani finally arrived in\n\nSeattle   on    September    8,    1998,     she    did   not   reveal    to     U.S.\n\nimmigration authorities that she was fleeing Uganda.                 Instead, she\n\ntold them that she was simply visiting the country for pleasure,\n\nconsistent with the visa in her passport.                 Approximately a year\n\nlater, Kalitani gave birth to a daughter in the United States.\n\n           In    addition     to    Kalitani's      testimony,      the   IJ    also\n\nconsidered a 1997 State Department country conditions report for\n\nUganda that      the   government     entered      in   evidence.     The      report\n\nconfirms that while the ruling government's human rights record\n\nimproved somewhat during 1996, \"numerous, serious problems remain\"\n\nand that \"[g]overnment forces committed or failed to prevent\n\nextrajudicial killings of suspected rebels and civilians.\"                        The\n\nreport also mentions the LRA, which it describes as killing,\n\ntorturing,      maiming,    raping,    and    abducting      large    numbers      of\n\ncivilians; displaying the mutilated bodies of their victims; and\n\nterrorizing civilians by hacking off limbs and noses and breaking\n\nlegs with hammers.         In addition, the report states that the LRA\n\n\"regularly abducted children of both sexes and virtually enslaved\n\nthem as concubines, guards, and soldiers.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f           Like the interviewing asylum officer before him, the IJ\n\nfound that the petitioner was simply not credible, citing specific\n\nexamples in her story of inconsistencies and unlikely assertions.\n\nAfter reviewing her asylum application and testimony, the IJ\n\nconcluded:\n\n      The respondent's inconsistencies, which I have found\n      [and] which are stated in the record, which the asylum\n      officer found was not credible, which I agree with,\n      reflect[], and I so find[,] that the respondent's\n      testimony concerning the reasons why she is afraid to\n      return to Uganda are not credible. . . . A reasonable\n      person similarly situated as the respondent would not\n      fear, based on this record[,] returning to Uganda, and I\n      find that the respondent[, upon] returning to Uganda[,]\n      would not be persecuted or [have] a well-founded fear of\n      persecution for what is contained in the asylum\n      application . . . [or] her testimony in these\n      proceedings[,] nor for her race, religion, nationality,\n      membership in a particular social group or political\n      opinion.   Consequently, her application for political\n      asylum will be denied as a matter of discretion.\n\nThe   IJ   then   denied   Kalitani's    requests   for   withholding   of\n\ndeportation and protection under CAT on essentially the same\n\ngrounds.\n\n                                   II.\n\n             The BIA's determination of an alien's eligibility for\n\nasylum \"must be upheld if supported by reasonable, substantial, and\n\nprobative evidence on the record considered as a whole.\"          INS v.\n\nElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted); see Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 372 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nWe may not disturb the decision of the BIA unless the evidence,\n\ntaken as a whole, would compel any reasonable adjudicator to reach\n\n                                  -6-\n\fa contrary conclusion. 8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(b)(4)(B) (2000). Moreover,\n\nKalitani bears the burden of establishing her eligibility for\n\nasylum.     8 C.F.R. ยง 208.13(a) (2000).              She may do so by showing\n\neither (1) that she has suffered past persecution on account of her\n\nrace, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social\n\ngroup, or political opinion; or (2) that she has a well-founded\n\nfear of suffering such persecution.                Id. ยง 208.13(b); Fesseha v.\n\nAshcroft, 333 F.3d 13, 18 (1st Cir. 2003).                          Because the BIA\n\naffirmed    without      opinion,    we     review    the    decision       of    the   IJ\n\ndirectly.    Herbert v. Ashcroft, 325 F.3d 68, 71 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n            The thrust of Kalitani's appeal is that the IJ's stated\n\nreasons for doubting her credibility were not sufficient to justify\n\nrejection of her claim.          On this basis, she argues that the IJ's\n\ndecision is not supported by substantial evidence, and that the IJ\n\ndenied her due process of law by failing to consider all pertinent\n\nevidence.     We disagree.\n\n            A review of the record reveals that there were adequate\n\ngrounds    for     the   IJ's   finding     that     Kalitani's      story       was    not\n\ncredible.     Cf. Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 571 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (\"[W]hen a hearing officer who saw and heard a witness makes\n\nan adverse credibility determination and supports it with specific\n\nfindings,     an     appellate      court       ordinarily        should    accord      it\n\nsignificant      respect.\").         First,      there      was    reason    to    doubt\n\npetitioner's identity.          She testified at the hearing that her true\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fname is Susan Nakiyemba, but the passport and birth certificate she\n\nproduced, both procured in 1998, show her surname as Kalitani. Her\n\nexplanation for the discrepancy was that the passport and birth\n\ncertificate were obtained for her by another person, who added his\n\nown surname.   But she inconsistently described this benefactor as\n\n\"a friend of my father\" and as \"the father of my friend.\"      Then,\n\nshe claimed that she was issued a visa to enter the United States\n\nwithout ever appearing at the U.S. Embassy in Uganda or at any\n\nother American embassy or consulate, and that she was issued a\n\nUgandan passport without a signature (which, of course, allowed her\n\nlater to add one).    She could not explain how her birth certificate\n\nwas procured or recall why her passport bore a stamp for Kampala,\n\nUganda. These facts suggest either that the passport and visa were\n\nfraudulently obtained or that Kalitani's story was not true.\n\nEither way, the IJ properly relied on this evidence in finding that\n\nKalitani lacked credibility.\n\n          Second, aspects of Kalitani's testimony were inherently\n\nincredible.    When Kalitani was first interviewed by the asylum\n\nofficer, she incorrectly told him that an AK-47 assault rifle, a\n\nweapon that she supposedly trained to use and that she testified\n\nshe had fired in the heat of battle, held only three or four rounds\n\nof ammunition.2      The IJ also found it extremely unlikely that\n\n\n     2\n       At her hearing before the IJ, Kalitani attempted to correct\nthis error, testifying that she had never told the asylum officer\nthat the weapon held so few rounds. She explained that she meant\n\n                                  -8-\n\fduring her two years with the LRA, Kalitani participated in only\n\none \"serious\" mission and that she never saw the LRA engage in any\n\nof the activities described in the country conditions report, as\n\nshe had testified.\n\n           Finally, the IJ observed Kalitani's demeanor and found\n\nher evasive, less than candid, and unresponsive.                   The IJ even\n\nwarned Kalitani during the hearing (though he certainly was not\n\nrequired to do so) that her credibility was an issue, and that a\n\ncredibility   determination     would      be   important   to    his    decision\n\nbecause she   had     offered   no   documentary     or   other    evidence    to\n\nsubstantiate her claims.        When asked why she applied for asylum,\n\nKalitani   gave   a   surprisingly     forthright     answer      that    further\n\nsupports the IJ's refusal to believe her tale of persecution:                 she\n\nsaid she applied for asylum because she had a baby (conceived and\n\nborn in the United States) and she realized her time to be in the\n\ncountry legally was running out.\n\n           On this record, we cannot say that the IJ's decision was\n\nerror at all, much less that the evidence compelled the IJ to find\n\nthat Kalitani had met the standards for asylum.                     See Elias-\n\nZacarias, 502 U.S. at 481 n.1.\n\n           Kalitani's due process claim is also without merit:                her\n\nargument is not that the IJ ignored evidence; indeed, no ignored\n\n\n\nto say the weapon held three or four magazines, each of which\ncontained 30 bullets.\n\n                                     -9-\n\fevidence is specified.    If her contention is simply that the IJ\n\nshould have noted other evidence supporting her credibility, it\n\nfails.   See Morales v. INS, 208 F.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n(\"Where, as here, the Board has given reasoned consideration to the\n\npetition, and made adequate findings, we will not require that it\n\naddress specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece\n\nof evidence the petitioner presented.\" (quoting Martinez v. INS,\n\n970 F.2d 973, 976 (1st Cir. 1992))).         Kalitani's argument boils\n\ndown to an assertion that the IJ should have believed her.          But the\n\nIJ was not compelled to believe her, and substantial evidence on\n\nthe administrative record supports his decision not to do so.\n\n          Because    Kalitani   did   not   meet   her   burden    to   show\n\neligibility for asylum, she necessarily also fails to establish\n\neligibility for withholding of removal.        Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 19\n\nn.6; Mediouni v. INS, 314 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 2002).            And given\n\nthe IJ's justifiable doubts about Kalitani's credibility, his\n\ndenial of relief under CAT is amply supported by the record.            See\n\nGuzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 16-17 (1st Cir. 2003) (burden is on\n\npetitioner under CAT to establish that torture is more likely than\n\nnot upon removal).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\f                               III.\n\n          We affirm the decision of the BIA denying the application\n\nfor asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT.3\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       Petitioner was not granted the privilege of leaving the\ncountry voluntarily and her petition does not challenge that\ndetermination.\n\n                               -11-\n\f",

She watched the soldiers execute her brother by firing squad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, Kalitani managed to escape and she fled into the forest. A pair of strangers rescued her and delivered her to the home of a friend, where she learned that her sister and grandmother had been killed. There was no news of her mother and other sister. She stayed with her friend for nine months. Then, by bribing border officials, Kalitani made her way into Kenya, where she boarded a plane and traveled to the United States via Switzerland and Denmark. She used a Ugandan passport and a U.S. entry visa obtained for her by a person whom she variously described as a friend of her father and as the father of a friend. She was unwilling or unable to say how this person obtained the passport or acquired the visa; Kalitani never personally visited an American consulate or embassy. When Kalitani finally arrived in Seattle on September 8, 1998, she did not reveal to U.S. immigration authorities that she was fleeing Uganda. Instead, she told them that she was simply visiting the country for pleasure, consistent with the visa in her passport. Approximately a year later, Kalitani gave birth to a daughter in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to Kalitani's testimony, the IJ also considered a 1997 State Department country conditions report for Uganda that the government entered in evidence. The report confirms that while the ruling government's human rights record improved somewhat during 1996, \"numerous, serious problems remain\" and that \"[g]overnment forces committed or failed to prevent extrajudicial killings of suspected rebels and civilians.\" The report also mentions the LRA, which it describes as killing, torturing, maiming, raping, and abducting large numbers of civilians; displaying the mutilated bodies of their victims; and terrorizing civilians by hacking off limbs and noses and breaking legs with hammers. In addition, the report states that the LRA \"regularly abducted children of both sexes and virtually enslaved them as concubines, guards, and soldiers.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like the interviewing asylum officer before him, the IJ found that the petitioner was simply not credible, citing specific examples in her story of inconsistencies and unlikely assertions.

Moreover, Kalitani bears the burden of establishing her eligibility for asylum. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(a) (2000). She may do so by showing either (1) that she has suffered past persecution on account of her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion; or (2) that she has a well-founded fear of suffering such persecution. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 208.13(b); <i>Fesseha v.

On this basis, she argues that the IJ's decision is not supported by substantial evidence, and that the IJ denied her due process of law by failing to consider all pertinent evidence. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A review of the record reveals that there were adequate grounds for the IJ's finding that Kalitani's story was not credible. <i>Cf. Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 571 (1st Cir.1999) (\"[W]hen a hearing officer who saw and heard a witness makes an adverse credibility determination and supports it with specific findings, an appellate court ordinarily should accord it significant respect.\"). First, there was reason to doubt petitioner's identity. She testified at the hearing that her true name is Susan Nakiyemba, but the passport and birth certificate she produced, both procured in 1998, show her surname as Kalitani. Her explanation for the discrepancy was that the passport and birth certificate were obtained for her by another person, who added his own surname. But she inconsistently described this benefactor as \"a friend of my father\" and as \"the father of my friend.\" Then, she claimed that she was issued a visa to enter the United States without ever appearing at the U.S. Embassy in Uganda or at any other American embassy or consulate, and that she was issued a Ugandan passport without a signature (which, of course, allowed her later to add one). She could not explain how her birth certificate was procured or recall why her passport bore a stamp for Kampala, Uganda. These facts suggest either that the passport and visa were fraudulently obtained or that Kalitani's story was not true. Either way, the IJ properly relied on this evidence in finding that Kalitani lacked credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, aspects of Kalitani's testimony were inherently incredible. When Kalitani was first interviewed by the asylum officer, she incorrectly told him that an AK-47 assault rifle, a weapon that she supposedly trained to use and that she testified she had fired in the heat of battle, held only three or four rounds of ammunition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The IJ also found it extremely unlikely that during her two years with the LRA, Kalitani participated in only one \"serious\" mission and that she never saw the LRA engage in any of the activities described in the country conditions report, as she had testified.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the IJ observed Kalitani's demeanor and found her evasive, less than candid, and unresponsive. The IJ even warned Kalitani during the hearing (though he certainly was not required to do so) that her credibility was an issue, and that a credibility determination would be important to his decision because she had offered no documentary or other evidence to substantiate her claims. When asked why she applied for asylum, Kalitani gave a surprisingly forthright answer that further supports the IJ's refusal to believe her tale of persecution: she said she applied for asylum because she had a baby (conceived and born in the United States) and she realized her time to be in the country legally was running out.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On this record, we cannot say that the IJ's decision was error at all, much less that the evidence <i>compelled</i> the IJ to find that Kalitani had met the standards for asylum. <i>See Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. at 481 n. 1, 112 S.Ct. 812.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kalitani's due process claim is also without merit: her argument is not that the IJ ignored evidence; indeed, no ignored evidence is specified. If her contention is simply that the IJ should have noted other evidence supporting her credibility, it fails. <i>See Morales v. INS,</i> 208 F.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir.2000) (\"Where, as here, the Board has given reasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate findings, we will not require that it address specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece of evidence the petitioner presented.\" (quoting <i>Martinez v. INS,</i> 970 F.2d 973, 976 (1st Cir.1992))). Kalitani's argument boils down to an assertion that the IJ should have believed her. But the IJ was not compelled to believe her, and substantial evidence on the administrative record supports his decision not to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Kalitani did not meet her burden to show eligibility for asylum, she necessarily also fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <i>Fesseha,</i> 333 F.3d at 19 n. 6; <i>Mediouni v. INS,</i> 314 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir.2002). And given the IJ's justifiable doubts about Kalitani's credibility, his denial of relief under CAT is amply supported by the record. <i>See Guzman v.

After overstaying her visa, she applied for asylum in August 1999 and received an interview with an asylum officer, who recommended against granting asylum. The INS began removal proceedings against Kalitani on March 6, 2000. Kalitani conceded the charge, declined to designate a country for removal, and sought asylum, withholding of deportation, relief under the U.N. Convention Against Torture (\"CAT\"),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and, in the event removal was necessary, voluntary departure. The Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") held a hearing on the merits of Kalitani's case on February 12, 2001, and on the same day issued an oral opinion denying her petition. The Board of Immigration Appeals (\"BIA\") issued a summary affirmance without opinion on September 27, 2002. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1003.1(a)(7) (2003) (formerly 8 C.F.R. &#167; 3.1(e)(4)). This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kalitani's asylum application and hearing testimony tell a dramatic and harrowing story. She testified that if she returns to Uganda, she will be killed by the government. Kalitani said that her father, Wasswa Henry Kabazzi, was a former rebel turned high-ranking military officer in Uganda when, in August 1995, soldiers abducted him from the family home. The soldiers claimed he was plotting to overthrow the government (which was controlled by the National Resistance Army). Soldiers burst into the house again at three o'clock in the morning on the same night. They searched for papers and weapons, beating family members who disclaimed knowledge of Kabazzi's activities. Kalitani, her mother, and her siblings fled to Kalitani's grandmother's home in another village, where they stayed for two weeks until soldiers discovered them hiding there. As the soldiers came in the front door of the house, Kalitani and her brother ran out the back. They took refuge in the forest and hid there for five days, unaware of what happened to the rest of the family. When they emerged from the woods, they took shelter briefly with a local priest and then sought protection from a group of rebels who were friends of their father. The rebels were members of the Lord's Resistance Army, known as the LRA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kalitani and her brother eventually decided to join the LRA. She lived at one of their training camps for over a year and a half, and belonged to the group for about two years in total. As a woman, she said, she was made to cook for the rebels and help with work around the camp. She also participated in some of the group's more dangerous activities. Three times, Kalitani was sent to spy on government barracks. In addition, she was trained to use weapons, including an AK-47 assault rifle. When she left the camp in the spring of 1997, armed with an AK-47, she received a \"serious\" mission: to raid government barracks and set free a number of rebel prisoners. There was a firefight during the mission and Kalitani fired on government soldiers, although she insisted that she did not kill anyone. She testified that she and her brother were captured after the firefight, beaten and tortured by soldiers of the National Resistance Army, and held prisoner in an underground room for over four months. During that time, the soldiers would periodically choose prisoners to execute. She watched the soldiers execute her brother by firing squad.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Eventually, Kalitani managed to escape and she fled into the forest. A pair of strangers rescued her and delivered her to the home of a friend, where she learned that her sister and grandmother had been killed. There was no news of her mother and other sister. She stayed with her friend for nine months. Then, by bribing border officials, Kalitani made her way into Kenya, where she boarded a plane and traveled to the United States via Switzerland and Denmark. She used a Ugandan passport and a U.S. entry visa obtained for her by a person whom she variously described as a friend of her father and as the father of a friend. She was unwilling or unable to say how this person obtained the passport or acquired the visa; Kalitani never personally visited an American consulate or embassy.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Kalitani's due process claim is also without merit: her argument is not that the IJ ignored evidence; indeed, no ignored evidence is specified. If her contention is simply that the IJ should have noted other evidence supporting her credibility, it fails. <i>See Morales v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768205\"><a href=\"/opinion/768205/juan-antonio-morales-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 328 (1st Cir.2000) (\"Where, as here, the Board has given reasoned consideration to the petition, and made adequate findings, we will not require that it address specifically each claim the petitioner made or each piece of evidence the petitioner presented.\" (quoting <i>Martinez v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587571\"><a href=\"/opinion/587571/javier-a-martinez-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">970</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">973</span></a></span>, 976 (1st Cir.1992))). Kalitani's argument boils down to an assertion that the IJ should have believed her. But the IJ was not compelled to believe her, and substantial evidence on the administrative record supports his decision not to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Kalitani did not meet her burden to show eligibility for asylum, she necessarily also fails to establish eligibility for withholding of removal. <i>Fesseha,</i> 333 F.3d at 19 n. 6; <i>Mediouni v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200253\"><a href=\"/opinion/200253/mediouni-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">314</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2002). And given the IJ's justifiable doubts about Kalitani's credibility, his denial of relief under CAT is amply supported by the record. <i>See Guzman v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200443\"><a href=\"/opinion/200443/guzman-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">327</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 16-17 (1st Cir.2003) (burden is on petitioner under CAT to establish that torture is more likely than not upon removal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>affirm</i> the decision of the BIA denying the application for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under CAT.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85<i>See generally Mediouni v.
