Jean Randal Romilus, a native and\n\ncitizen of Haiti, petitions for review of the decision of the Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals (“BIA”) denying him asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against\n\nTorture (“CAT”).      We deny the petition.\n\nI.          Background\n\n            Romilus, a farmer from the village of Ghantier, attempted\n\nto enter the United States with a falsified passport on March 5,\n\n1999.    The INS issued a Notice to Appear, charging Romilus as\n\nremovable     under      8    U.S.C.     §§   1182(a)(6)(C)(i)   and\n\n1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).1     Romilus admitted the factual allegations in\n\nthe notice and conceded removability, but sought relief in the form\n\nof asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act (“INA”).     He also applied for relief under Article\n\n3 of the Convention Against Torture.2\n\n            The basis for the claims is persecution on account of\n\npolitical opinion.       In hearings before the Immigration Judge\n\n\n     1\n      In March 2003, after removal proceedings were initiated in\nthis case, the relevant functions of the Immigration and\nNaturalization Service (“INS”) were reorganized and transferred\ninto the new Department of Homeland Security.        For ease of\nreference, we continue to refer to the agency as the INS.\n     2\n      The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment, signed and ratified by the\nUnited States, was implemented by the Foreign Affairs Reform and\nRestructuring Act of 1998 § 2242, Pub. L. No. 105-277, Div. G., 112\nStat. 2681-761 (1998) (codified at 8 U.S.C. § 1231). Article 3\nprohibits states from returning individuals to other states where\nthere are substantial grounds for believing they would be tortured.\n\n                                   -2-\n\f(“IJ”), Romilus testified about four incidents in support of his\n\nclaims. The first two incidents involved an oral agreement he made\n\nin 1992 with Jean Marie, a military officer, to care for Marie's\n\ncow in return for an equal share of the profits from the sale of\n\nthe cow.   Marie's later failure to share the proceeds was followed\n\nby two physical confrontations between the two men, with Marie\n\ninitiating physical contact on both occasions.          Romilus has had no\n\nconfrontations with Marie since then.\n\n            The third incident occurred in 1997.         Romilus testified\n\nthat armed men dressed in civilian clothes broke into his house\n\nwhile he and his wife were asleep.          The armed intruders pointed a\n\ngun at his wife and demanded that she give them money she had\n\nearned as a street vendor.      One of them demanded that Romilus hand\n\nover the money, also at gunpoint.           Fearing for his life, Romilus\n\nsurrendered the money he had hidden under his pillow.              The armed\n\nmen took the money and left.\n\n            The   fourth   incident    involved   a   grassroots   community\n\norganization called the Organization for the Progress of the Young\n\nPeople (\"OPJP\").     Romilus joined the OPJP in 1998 and was made a\n\ndelegate of the organization.         The OPJP consisted of 15 founding\n\nmembers, all from Ghantier, and was led by a man named Louis\n\nBlaise.    According to Romilus, the OPJP is a \"progressive movement\n\nfor young people seeking to make democratic changes in Haiti,” and\n\nits goals include improving the local community by building new\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fschools, healthcare facilities, and making clean water available\n\nfor drinking and farming.        Romilus testified that the OPJP seeks\n\ngovernment cooperation and the participation of local residents,\n\nalthough not all the townspeople support the organization.\n\n             Romilus testified that an OPJP meeting was held at the\n\nGhantier schoolhouse on January 31, 1999.             Blaise was addressing a\n\ncrowd of approximately 250 to 300 people when an unspecified number\n\nof armed men, dressed in civilian clothes, entered the school and\n\nbegan    physically    assaulting      the   people    in    attendance.        The\n\nassailants beat attendees with their weapons and fists and shot\n\nBlaise in the arm.      Romilus himself was struck in the jaw and lost\n\ntwo teeth.    The intruders also seized OPJP documents.              Romilus was\n\nunable to identify any of the men who broke up the meeting because\n\nmany of them wore masks and none wore a uniform.\n\n             Romilus fled the scene and ran toward his home. En route\n\nhe was stopped by his neighbors who told him that his house had\n\nbeen set on fire and that armed men were waiting for him.                  Fearing\n\nfor his life, Romilus hid in the woods.               He remained in hiding,\n\nsleeping in churches and schoolhouses, until he departed Haiti in\n\nMarch.     Nobody     informed   the   police   about       the   attack   on   the\n\nschoolhouse, and no newspaper reported the incident.\n\n             While Romilus was in hiding, his parents helped to obtain\n\na French passport and a plane ticket for him.                 Romilus departed\n\nPort-au-Prince, Haiti, and entered the United States at Miami\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fInternational Airport.      After his arrival in the United States,\n\nRomilus received an audio cassette tape from his wife.           According\n\nto Romilus, his wife states in the tape that since he left Haiti\n\nshe has experienced \"problems,” she has been \"persecuted,” and\n\nthat, as a result of her persecution, she was forced to leave the\n\nhouse where she was living.       Romilus testified that his parents\n\nalso continue to live in Haiti, and that they have not been harmed\n\nsince he left.\n\n           Romilus   submitted     background     documentary     evidence\n\nconcerning country conditions and the often unstable political\n\nclimate in Haiti.3      Romilus's expert witness, Marlye Gelin-Adams,\n\nprovided   background    information     concerning   Haiti's   many   local\n\ngrassroots organizations.     She did not, however, have any personal\n\nknowledge of the OPJP.      She stated that there are some members of\n\nthe government who view these grassroots organizations as a threat\n\nto their power because they exert pressure on the government to\n\nremain democratic and to honor Haiti's constitution. Additionally,\n\nshe testified that there are non-governmental groups operating in\n\n\n     3\n      This evidence outlines Haiti's recent turbulent political\nhistory: from the overthrow of the repressive Duvalier regime in\n1986, to the installation of Haiti's first democratically elected\nchief executive, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in 1990, to Aristide's\nouster seven months later in a bloody coup headed by General Raoul\nCedras, to the military's decline in power and Aristide's eventual\nreturn to power in late 1994. Country condition and human rights\nreports reflect that, despite the introduction of democracy to\nHaiti in the 1990s, elements of the repressive regimes lingered and\nhuman rights abuses, committed by both government and non-\ngovernment actors, continued throughout the decade.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fHaiti that     oppose     the    pro-democracy      grassroots     organizations.\n\nAccording    to   Adams,    “armed     thugs”       from   some    of    these    non-\n\ngovernmental factions have attacked and threatened members of the\n\npro-democracy     organizations,       and    the    national     police    has   had\n\ntrouble controlling the violence because its numbers are small and\n\nits officers are inexperienced or violent themselves.\n\n            In an oral decision, the IJ denied Romilus's application\n\nfor asylum and withholding of removal.               The IJ found that the two\n\nincidents involving the military officer, Jean Marie, were simply\n\nthe consequence of a personal dispute and were not prompted by any\n\nof the statutorily protected grounds. Similarly, the IJ found that\n\nthe robbery at Romilus's home was economically motivated and not\n\nlinked to any protected ground.\n\n            Regarding the fourth incident, the IJ found no evidence\n\nthat the OPJP was a political player in Haiti.                Based on Romilus's\n\ntestimony, the IJ viewed the OPJP as a community organization\n\ncreated to improve living conditions for the local populace, and\n\nthat   it   was    merely       Romilus's    personal      perception      that    the\n\norganization      might   also     support    his    beliefs      in    establishing\n\ndemocracy in Haiti.       With regard to the attack on the OPJP meeting,\n\nthe IJ found it critical that Romilus could neither identify the\n\nattackers nor testify to what, if anything, the attackers said\n\nduring their raid.          Therefore, the IJ declined to impute any\n\npolitical motive to the raid.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f            Based on these findings, the IJ concluded that Romilus\n\nhad failed to show past persecution on account of a protected\n\nground. The IJ also found that Romilus had not established a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution because his testimony was not\n\ncredible.   Having failed to establish eligibility for asylum, the\n\nIJ found that Romilus could not meet the burden for withholding of\n\nremoval.    Finally, the IJ found that Romilus did not present any\n\nevidence that a government official or any other person acting in\n\nan official capacity \"has any interest in [him].”                     Therefore,\n\nRomilus had failed to meet his burden of proof under the CAT.\n\n            Romilus timely appealed to the BIA.              In a per curiam\n\ndecision,   the    BIA   agreed   with    Romilus   that    the   IJ's   adverse\n\ncredibility determination was erroneous.              Nevertheless, the BIA\n\naffirmed the denial of asylum and withholding of removal, agreeing\n\nwith the IJ that Romilus had “not shown a nexus between the harm he\n\nsuffered and one of the five [protected] grounds.”                  The BIA also\n\naffirmed, without discussion, the IJ's denial of relief under the\n\nTorture Convention.\n\nII.         Standard of Review\n\n            We    review   the    BIA's    findings    of    fact     under   the\n\n“substantial evidence” standard.           Guzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 15\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (citation omitted). “This standard applies both to\n\nasylum and withholding claims as well as to claims brought under\n\nCAT.”   Settenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004).                The\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\fBIA's determinations “must be upheld if 'supported by reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\nwhole.'” INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992) (citation\n\nomitted).   Under this deferential standard of review, “we will not\n\nreverse unless 'the record evidence would compel a reasonable\n\nfactfinder to make a contrary determination.'” Guzman, 327 F.3d at\n\n15 (quoting Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir.\n\n1999)); see also   8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).   We review questions of\n\nlaw de novo, “including alleged errors related to due process\n\nclaims.”    Settenda, 377 F.3d at 93 (citations omitted).\n\n            Ordinarily, this court reviews the decision of the BIA.\n\n“When the BIA does not render its own opinion, however, and either\n\ndefers [to] or adopts the opinion of the IJ, a Court of Appeals\n\nmust then review the decision of the IJ.”      Albathani v. INS, 318\n\nF.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Gao v. Ashcroft, 299 F.3d\n\n266, 271 (3d Cir. 2002)).    In this case, where the BIA's decision\n\nadopts portions of the IJ's opinion, we review those portions of\n\nthe IJ's opinion that the BIA has adopted.     See Chen v. Ashcroft,\n\n376 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir. 2004) (“[W]hen the BIA both adopts the\n\nfindings of the IJ and discusses some of the bases for the IJ's\n\ndecision, we have authority to review the decisions of both the IJ\n\nand the BIA.”) (citations omitted).\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fIII.      Discussion\n\n          Romilus argues that the BIA committed four reversible\n\nerrors:      (1)   concluding    that   the    OPJP     is    not   a   political\n\norganization; (2) concluding that the harm he suffered was not on\n\naccount of his political opinion; (3) affirming the IJ's denial of\n\nasylum and withholding of removal; and (4) depriving Romilus of due\n\nprocess by neglecting to adjudicate his claim for relief under the\n\nCAT. Regarding the first issue, because we find the classification\n\nof the OPJP is not dispositive in this case, we will assume, for\n\npurposes of analysis and without deciding, that the OPJP is a\n\npolitical organization.\n\n          A.        Asylum and Withholding of Removal\n\n          Section 208(a) of the INA authorizes the Attorney General\n\nto exercise his discretion to grant asylum to eligible refugee\n\naliens.    8 U.S.C. § 1159(a).          The alien bears the burden of\n\nestablishing eligibility for asylum by proving that he qualifies as\n\na refugee.     8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(a).                     A\n\n“refugee” is any person who is unable or unwilling to return to his\n\ncountry   of   nationality      or   avail    himself    of    that     country's\n\nprotection because he has suffered past persecution in that country\n\nor has a well-founded fear of future persecution in that country.\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A). To prove past persecution, an applicant\n\nmust provide “conclusive evidence” that he has suffered persecution\n\non one of five protected grounds:             race, religion, nationality,\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fmembership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\n\nAlbathani, 318 F.3d at 373; see also 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1).                “To\n\nestablish a well-founded fear of future persecution, applicants can\n\noffer specific proof, or they can claim the benefit of a regulatory\n\npresumption     based   on   proof    of   past   persecution.”        Khalil v.\n\nAshcroft, 337 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir. 2003) (citations omitted).\n\n           Romilus's asylum application relies on four incidents:\n\nthe two confrontations with Jean Marie, the robbery, and the raid\n\non the OPJP meeting and subsequent burning down of Romilus's house.\n\nSubstantial evidence supports the BIA's conclusion that Romilus\n\nfailed to show a sufficient nexus between the harm he suffered on\n\nthese occasions and one of the five grounds protected by the INA.\n\nSince the BIA's discussion of the nexus requirement implicitly\n\nadopts the IJ's findings on that issue, we will review the BIA's\n\ndecision in conjunction with the IJ's findings.\n\n           With regard to the first two incidents, the record\n\nsupports the IJ's conclusion that the hostilities between Romilus\n\nand Marie arose from a purely personal dispute.            Marie breached an\n\noral agreement with Romilus and, when confronted by Romilus,\n\nreacted with violence.       There is no evidence that Marie threatened\n\nRomilus because of his political opinion. In fact, these incidents\n\noccurred years before Romilus joined the OPJP.               The INA is not\n\nintended   to    protect     aliens   from    violence   based    on    personal\n\nanimosity.      See Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at 572.\n\n\n                                      -10-\n\f           With regard to the 1997 incident, the IJ did not err in\n\nconcluding that the robbery was economically motivated:          Romilus's\n\nwife was a local street vendor who collected money daily from her\n\nsales, the money was kept in their house, the robbers wore civilian\n\nclothes, when Romilus surrendered the money the armed robbers went\n\naway, and the robbers said nothing apart from demanding the money.\n\nRomilus claims that his house was \"targeted,” but nothing in the\n\nrecord compels the conclusion that the targeting was based on\n\nRomilus's political affiliation.        Indeed, a logical reading of the\n\nrecord leads to the conclusion that Romilus's house was targeted\n\nbecause it was public knowledge that his wife had money from her\n\nmarket business.   See Albathani, 318 F.3d at 373 (the two alleged\n\nincidents of persecution “may well have been, as the IJ suggested,\n\nnothing more than the robbery of someone driving a Mercedes with\n\ncash in his pocket”).      And again, this robbery occurred before\n\nRomilus joined the OPJP.\n\n           The 1999 raid of the OPJP meeting, and the subsequent\n\nburning of Romilus's house, present a closer question.             The BIA\n\nfound it critical that Romilus had failed to identify the attackers\n\nor to articulate any motive for the attack.          In response Romilus\n\nargues,   correctly,   that   he   is   not   required   to   identify   his\n\npersecutors.   See Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 45 (1st Cir. 1998);\n\nCordero-Trejo v. INS, 40 F.3d 482, 488 (1st Cir. 1994).           Nor is he\n\nrequired to establish their exact motivations. Elias-Zacarias, 502\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fU.S. at 483.     But he is required to “provide some evidence of\n\n[their motivations], direct or circumstantial.”          Id. (emphasis in\n\noriginal). The BIA found that Romilus failed to produce sufficient\n\nevidence in this regard, and we cannot say that a contrary finding\n\nwas compelled by the record evidence.\n\n           Romilus argues that his case is akin to Cordero-Trejo.\n\nIn that case, we held that an asylum applicant could not be\n\ndiscredited for failing to identify his persecutors when they were\n\npart of a group that was “unofficial and 'clandestine'” and were\n\n“by definition 'unknown.'”        40 F.3d at 488.    But that opinion went\n\non to explain that “the only way [such clandestine persecutors] are\n\nknowable, i.e., distinguishable from mere bandits and criminals, is\n\nby the threats and indications of motive that typically precede or\n\naccompany their violence.” Id. In contrast to Cordero-Trejo, here\n\nthere is   no   evidence   that    the   attackers   demanded   Romilus   to\n\n“discontinue his activities with” the OPJP, nor that he received\n\n“warnings of future violence should he disregard” those demands.\n\nId.   In our view, the present case is more comparable to Aguilar-\n\nSolis, where we held that the petitioner's evidence of persecution\n\n“lacked the requisite degree of specificity” necessary to establish\n\n“a sufficient nexus between the events that [the petitioner]\n\ndescribed and any” statutorily protected ground.          168 F.3d at 571.\n\nAccepting Romilus's testimony as true, and assuming that the OPJP\n\nis a political organization, the record does not establish that the\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fattackers of the OPJP meeting were motivated by a desire to\n\nsuppress the OPJP's political aspirations.     There is no evidence\n\nthat the attackers were even aware of the OPJP.     See id.    Perhaps\n\nthe best evidence in support of Romilus's argument is the seizure\n\nof the OPJP documents.      The BIA might have inferred that the\n\nattackers seized those documents because they sought to disrupt the\n\nOPJP.    This evidence, however, is far from conclusive.   “Where, as\n\nhere[,] the constellation of facts and circumstances alleged by an\n\nasylum applicant, together with the other record evidence, supports\n\ntwo or more competing inferences, the IJ's choice among those\n\ninferences cannot be deemed erroneous.”     Id. (citation omitted).\n\n            Since Romilus failed to establish past persecution, he is\n\nnot entitled to the statutory presumption of a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution.    Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 264 (1st Cir.\n\n2000).    Nevertheless, Romilus could establish a well-founded fear\n\nof persecution if he could prove that “a reasonable person in [his]\n\ncircumstances would fear persecution on account of a statutorily\n\nprotected ground.”    Khalil, 337 F.3d at 56 (quoting Aguilar-Solis,\n\n168 F.3d at 572).       Accordingly, a well-founded fear analysis\n\ncontains both a subjective and objective component:           Romilus's\n\nasserted fear must be both subjectively genuine and objectively\n\nreasonable.    Guzman, 327 F.3d at 16 (citations omitted).\n\n            By reversing the negative credibility determination and\n\naffirming the IJ solely on the ground that there was no nexus to a\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fprotected ground, the BIA implicitly accepted that Romilus had a\n\nsubjectively genuine fear.            Thus, we focus on whether a reasonable\n\nperson in Romilus's circumstances would fear persecution on account\n\nof a protected ground. The record does not compel this conclusion.\n\n              Romilus claims that his wife faces continuing persecution\n\nin Haiti. His testimony on this topic, however, was ambiguous, not\n\n“specific”     as    required.        Id.      Romilus   testified    on   direct\n\nexamination that his wife had sent him an audio cassette in which\n\nshe stated that she has had “a lot of problem[s]” since he left the\n\ncountry, and that she has been “persecuted.”                  But, when asked\n\nfollow-up questions, Romilus provided no details other than to\n\nrepeat that she has had some kind of undefined problems.                      Even\n\nassuming Romilus's spouse has faced persecution, his conclusory\n\ntestimony      is    insufficient      to   provide   any   link    between   the\n\npersecution and a protected ground. See Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at\n\n573 (rejecting the probative value of letters written by persons\n\nliving   in    the    country    of    removal   because    the   correspondence\n\ncontained no “specifics as to the nature of any danger, the\n\nidentity of any potential malefactors, or the reasons why people\n\nmight wish to harm the petitioner”).             Moreover, Romilus testified\n\nthat his parents still live in Ghantier and they have suffered no\n\nharm since he left the country.             See id. (“[T]he fact that close\n\nrelatives continue to live peacefully in the alien's homeland\n\nundercuts the alien's claim that persecution awaits his return.”).\n\n\n                                        -14-\n\fThe BIA reasonably concluded that Romilus could be returned to\n\nHaiti without facing future persecution.          Romilus has failed to\n\nestablish his eligibility to be considered for the discretionary\n\nrelief of asylum.\n\n             Withholding of removal, which provides mandatory relief,\n\nimposes a higher standard than asylum. INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre, 526\n\nU.S. 415, 419 (1999) (an applicant for withholding of removal must\n\nprove that it is “more likely than not” that he would be subject to\n\npersecution on account of a protected ground).             Because Romilus\n\nfailed to satisfy the more lenient asylum standard, he a fortiori\n\ncannot satisfy the withholding of removal standard. Albathani, 318\n\nF.3d at 374.\n\n             B.     Convention Against Torture\n\n             The standard for relief under the CAT is different than\n\nfor asylum or withholding of removal. The applicant need not prove\n\nthe reason for the torture, nor that he has a well-founded fear of\n\nbeing tortured.     Rather, he must establish that it is “more likely\n\nthan not” that he will be tortured if he is returned to the\n\nproposed country of removal.       Elien v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 392, 398\n\n(1st Cir. 2004) (citing 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.16(c)(2), 208.17(a)).\n\nUnlike an asylum claim, then, there is no subjective component. To\n\nestablish a prima facie claim under the CAT, an applicant must\n\noffer specific objective evidence showing that he will be subject\n\nto:   “(1)   an   act   causing   severe   physical   or   mental   pain   or\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\fsuffering;   (2)   intentionally   inflicted;   (3)   for   a   proscribed\n\npurpose; (4) by or at the instigation of or with the consent or\n\nacquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical\n\ncontrol of the victim; and (5) not arising from lawful sanctions.”\n\nId. (quoting In re J-E-, 23 I. & N. Dec. 291, 297 (BIA 2002)); see\n\nalso 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a).     Thus, an applicant must demonstrate\n\nthat any torture he will suffer would be at the hands of the\n\ngovernment or with the consent or acquiescence of the government.\n\nGuzman, 327 F.3d at 17.\n\n          Romilus contends that the absence of written analysis in\n\nthe BIA's disposition of his CAT claim deprived him of due process.\n\nThe BIA is not required, however, to provide a written analysis of\n\nevery issue contested before the IJ.      See Morales v. INS, 208 F.3d\n\n323, 328 (1st Cir. 2000); Chen v. INS, 87 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).   The BIA may adopt all of or portions of the IJ's opinion.\n\nSee Albathani, 318 F.3d at 377-78.        We read the BIA's opinion as\n\nadopting the IJ's analysis of the CAT claim.4     Thus, we will review\n\nthe IJ's opinion with regard to the CAT claim.\n\n\n\n     4\n      The BIA rejected the IJ's adverse credibility determination,\nyet affirmed the IJ's ultimate conclusions. Since the negative\ncredibility finding was important to the IJ's well-founded fear\nanalysis, the BIA was required to clarify that it was affirming the\nIJ on the basis of the IJ's finding that there was no nexus between\nany such fear and a protected ground. The IJ's analysis of the CAT\nclaim, however, did not rely on the negative credibility\ndetermination. Therefore, since the BIA agreed with the IJ's CAT\nanalysis, the BIA was not obligated to provide its own analysis of\nthat claim.\n\n                                   -16-\n\f           The IJ denied Romilus's CAT claim based on a lack of\n\nevidence showing that he is likely to be tortured by or with the\n\nconsent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting\n\nin an official capacity.           Indeed, with the possible exception of\n\nthe two incidents with the military officer, Jean Marie, there is\n\nno   evidence   that   any    of    the    above-mentioned    incidents       were\n\ninstigated    on   behalf    of,    with    the   consent   of,   or   with   the\n\nacquiescence of the government.            See Guzman, 327 F.3d at 17.        With\n\nregard to the two incidents with Marie, the IJ reasonably found\n\nthat these incidents sprang from a personal dispute.               Thus, Marie\n\nwas not acting in an official capacity when he assaulted Romilus.\n\nMoreover, as the IJ noted, Romilus did not experience any further\n\nproblems with Marie after the two incidents in 1994.\n\n             Romilus argues that expert testimony and documentary\n\nevidence establish that the Haitian government sanctions attacks on\n\ndemocratic organizations such as the OPJP. But this evidence falls\n\nshort of meeting the burden required under the CAT.               None of this\n\nevidence specifically refers to Romilus or the OPJP.                   Moreover,\n\neven Romilus's expert witness had difficulty identifying which\n\ngroups might be interested in persecuting Romilus upon his return\n\nto Haiti and whether or not those groups were connected to the\n\ngovernment.     She did testify that there are some members of the\n\ngovernment who are involved in oppressing groups similar to the\n\nOPJP, but we would be hard pressed to find that her uncertain\n\n\n                                      -17-\n\ftestimony on this point satisfies the “more likely than not”\n\nstandard.   In any event, it does not “compel” reversal of the IJ.\n\n            Romilus has not established that it is more likely than\n\nnot that he will be subjected to torture if he is returned to\n\nHaiti.\n\nIV.         Conclusion\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, the petition for review is\n\ndenied.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                -18-\n\f",

We deny the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus, a farmer from the village of Ghantier, attempted to enter the United States with a falsified passport on March 5, 1999. The INS issued a Notice to Appear, charging Romilus as removable under 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) and 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Romilus admitted the factual allegations in the notice and conceded removability, but sought relief in the form of asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"). He also applied for relief under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basis for the claims is persecution on account of political opinion. In hearings before the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\"), Romilus testified about four incidents in support of his claims. The first two incidents involved an oral agreement he made in 1992 with Jean Marie, a military officer, to care for Marie's cow in return for an equal share of the profits from the sale of the cow. Marie's later failure to share the proceeds was followed by two physical confrontations between the two men, with Marie initiating physical contact on both occasions. Romilus has had no confrontations with Marie since then.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third incident occurred in 1997. Romilus testified that armed men dressed in civilian clothes broke into his house while he and his wife were asleep. The armed intruders pointed a gun at his wife and demanded that she give them money she had earned as a street vendor. One of them demanded that Romilus hand over the money, also at gunpoint. Fearing for his life, Romilus surrendered the money he had hidden under his pillow. The armed men took the money and left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourth incident involved a grassroots community organization called the Organization for the Progress of the Young People (\"OPJP\"). Romilus joined the OPJP in 1998 and was made a delegate of the organization. The OPJP consisted of 15 founding members, all from Ghantier, and was led by a man named Louis Blaise. According to Romilus, the OPJP is a \"progressive movement for young people seeking to make democratic changes in Haiti,\" and its goals include improving the local community by building new schools, healthcare facilities, and making clean water available for drinking and farming. Romilus testified that the OPJP seeks government cooperation and the participation of local residents, although not all the townspeople support the organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus testified that an OPJP meeting was held at the Ghantier schoolhouse on January 31, 1999. Blaise was addressing a crowd of approximately 250 to 300 people when an unspecified number of armed men, dressed in civilian clothes, entered the school and began physically assaulting the people in attendance. The assailants beat attendees with their weapons and fists and shot Blaise in the arm. Romilus himself was struck in the jaw and lost two teeth. The intruders also seized OPJP documents. Romilus was unable to identify any of the men who broke up the meeting because many of them wore masks and none wore a uniform.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus fled the scene and ran toward his home. En route he was stopped by his neighbors who told him that his house had been set on fire and that armed men were waiting for him. Fearing for his life, Romilus hid in the woods. He remained in hiding, sleeping in churches and schoolhouses, until he departed Haiti in March. Nobody informed the police about the attack on the schoolhouse, and no newspaper reported the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Romilus was in hiding, his parents helped to obtain a French passport and a plane ticket for him. Romilus departed Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and entered the United States at Miami International Airport. After his arrival in the United States, Romilus received an audio cassette tape from his wife. According to Romilus, his wife states in the tape that since he left Haiti she has experienced \"problems,\" she has been \"persecuted,\" and that, as a result of her persecution, she was forced to leave the house where she was living. Romilus testified that his parents also continue to live in Haiti, and that they have not been harmed since he left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus submitted background documentary evidence concerning country conditions and the often unstable political climate in Haiti.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Romilus's expert witness, Marlye Gelin-Adams, provided background information concerning Haiti's many local grassroots organizations. She did not, however, have any personal knowledge of the OPJP. She stated that there are some members of the government who view these grassroots organizations as a threat to their power because they exert pressure on the government to remain democratic and to honor Haiti's constitution. Additionally, she testified that there are non-governmental groups operating in Haiti that oppose the pro-democracy grassroots organizations. According to Adams, \"armed thugs\" from some of these non-governmental factions have attacked and threatened members of the pro-democracy organizations, and the national police has had trouble controlling the violence because its numbers are small and its officers are inexperienced or violent themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an oral decision, the IJ denied Romilus's application for asylum and withholding of removal. The IJ found that the two incidents involving the military officer, Jean Marie, were simply the consequence of a personal dispute and were not prompted by any of the statutorily protected grounds. Similarly, the IJ found that the robbery at Romilus's home was economically motivated and not linked to any protected ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the fourth incident, the IJ found no evidence that the OPJP was a political player in Haiti. Based on Romilus's testimony, the IJ viewed the OPJP as a community organization created to improve living conditions for the local populace, and that it was merely Romilus's personal perception that the organization might also support his beliefs in establishing democracy in Haiti. With regard to the attack on the OPJP meeting, the IJ found it critical that Romilus could neither identify the attackers nor testify to what, if anything, the attackers said during their raid. Therefore, the IJ declined to impute any political motive to the raid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these findings, the IJ concluded that Romilus had failed to show past persecution on account of a protected ground. The IJ also found that Romilus had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution because his testimony was not credible. Having failed to establish eligibility for asylum, the IJ found that Romilus could not meet the burden for withholding of removal. Finally, the IJ found that Romilus did not present any evidence that a government official or any other person acting in an official capacity \"has any interest in [him].\" Therefore, Romilus had failed to meet his burden of proof under the CAT.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus timely appealed to the BIA. In a per curiam decision, the BIA agreed with Romilus that the IJ's adverse credibility determination was erroneous. Nevertheless, the BIA affirmed the denial of asylum and withholding of removal, agreeing with the IJ that Romilus had \"not shown a nexus between the harm he suffered and one of the five [protected] grounds.\" The BIA also affirmed, without discussion, the IJ's denial of relief under the Torture Convention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. Standard of Review</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the BIA's findings of fact under the \"substantial evidence\" standard. <i>Guzman v. INS,</i> 327 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir.2003) (citation omitted). \"This standard applies both to asylum and withholding claims as well as to claims brought under CAT.\" <i>Settenda v. Ashcroft,</i> 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir.2004). The BIA's determinations \"must be upheld if `supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a whole.'\" <i>INS v. Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. 478, 481, 112 S.Ct. 812, 117 L.Ed.2d 38 (1992) (citation omitted). Under this deferential standard of review, \"we will not reverse unless `the record evidence would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination.'\" <i>Guzman,</i> 327 F.3d at 15 (quoting <i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir.1999)); <i>see also</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(b)(4)(B). We review questions of law de novo, \"including alleged errors related to due process claims.\" <i>Settenda,</i> 377 F.3d at 93 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ordinarily, this court reviews the decision of the BIA. \"When the BIA does not render its own opinion, however, and either defers [to] or adopts the opinion of the IJ, a Court of Appeals must then review the decision of the IJ.\" <i>Albathani v. INS,</i> 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir.2003) (quoting <i>Gao v. Ashcroft,</i> 299 F.3d 266, 271 (3d Cir.2002)). In this case, where the BIA's decision adopts portions of the IJ's opinion, we review those portions of the IJ's opinion that the BIA has adopted. <i>See Chen v. Ashcroft,</i> 376 F.3d 215, 222 (3d Cir.2004) (\"[W]hen the BIA both adopts the findings of the IJ and discusses some of the bases for the IJ's decision, we have authority to review the decisions of both the IJ and the BIA.\") (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus argues that the BIA committed four reversible errors: (1) concluding that the OPJP is not a political organization; (2) concluding that the harm he suffered was not on account of his political opinion; (3) affirming the IJ's denial of asylum and withholding of removal; and (4) depriving Romilus of due process by neglecting to adjudicate his claim for relief under the CAT. Regarding the first issue, because we find the classification of the OPJP is not dispositive in this case, we will assume, for purposes of analysis and without deciding, that the OPJP is a political organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Asylum and Withholding of Removal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 208(a) of the INA authorizes the Attorney General to exercise his discretion to grant asylum to eligible refugee aliens. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1159(a). The alien bears the burden of establishing eligibility for asylum by proving that he qualifies as a refugee. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(a). A \"refugee\" is any person who is unable or unwilling to return to his country of nationality or avail himself of that country's protection because he has suffered past persecution in that country or has a well-founded fear of future persecution in that country. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A). To prove past persecution, an applicant must provide \"conclusive evidence\" that he has suffered persecution on one of five protected grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <i>Albathani,</i> 318 F.3d at 373; <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(1). \"To establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, applicants can offer specific proof, or they can claim the benefit of a regulatory presumption based on proof of past persecution.\" <i>Khalil v. Ashcroft,</i> 337 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir.2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus's asylum application relies on four incidents: the two confrontations with Jean Marie, the robbery, and the raid on the OPJP meeting and subsequent burning down of Romilus's house. Substantial evidence supports the BIA's conclusion that Romilus failed to show a sufficient nexus between the harm he suffered on these occasions and one of the five grounds protected by the INA. Since the BIA's discussion of the nexus requirement implicitly adopts the IJ's findings on that issue, we will review the BIA's decision in conjunction with the IJ's findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to the first two incidents, the record supports the IJ's conclusion that the hostilities between Romilus and Marie arose from a purely personal dispute. Marie breached an oral agreement with Romilus and, when confronted by Romilus, reacted with violence. There is no evidence that Marie threatened Romilus because of his political opinion. In fact, these incidents occurred years before Romilus joined the OPJP. The INA is not intended to protect aliens from violence based on personal animosity. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to the 1997 incident, the IJ did not err in concluding that the robbery was economically motivated: Romilus's wife was a local street vendor who collected money daily from her sales, the money was kept in their house, the robbers wore civilian clothes, when Romilus surrendered the money the armed robbers went away, and the robbers said nothing apart from demanding the money. Romilus claims that his house was \"targeted,\" but nothing in the record compels the conclusion that the targeting was based on Romilus's political affiliation. Indeed, a logical reading of the record leads to the conclusion that Romilus's house was targeted because it was public knowledge that his wife had money from her market business. <i>See Albathani,</i> 318 F.3d at 373 (the two alleged incidents of persecution \"may well have been, as the IJ suggested, nothing more than the robbery of someone driving a Mercedes with cash in his pocket\"). And again, this robbery occurred <i>before</i> Romilus joined the OPJP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1999 raid of the OPJP meeting, and the subsequent burning of Romilus's house, present a closer question. The BIA found it critical that Romilus had failed to identify the attackers or to articulate any motive for the attack. In response Romilus argues, correctly, that he is not required to identify his persecutors. <i>See Gailius v. INS,</i> 147 F.3d 34, 45 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Cordero-Trejo v.

But he is required to \"provide <i>some</i> evidence of [their motivations], direct or circumstantial.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original). The BIA found that Romilus failed to produce sufficient evidence in this regard, and we cannot say that a contrary finding was compelled by the record evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus argues that his case is akin to <i>Cordero-Trejo.</i> In that case, we held that an asylum applicant could not be discredited for failing to identify his persecutors when they were part of a group that was \"unofficial and `clandestine'\" and were \"by definition `unknown.'\" 40 F.3d at 488. But that opinion went on to explain that \"the only way [such clandestine persecutors] are knowable, i.e., distinguishable from mere bandits and criminals, is by the threats and indications of motive that typically precede or accompany their violence.\" <i>Id.</i> In contrast to <i>Cordero-Trejo,</i> here there is no evidence that the attackers demanded Romilus to \"discontinue his activities with\" the OPJP, nor that he received \"warnings of future violence should he disregard\" those demands. <i>Id.</i> In our view, the present case is more comparable to <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> where we held that the petitioner's evidence of persecution \"lacked the requisite degree of specificity\" necessary to establish \"a sufficient nexus between the events that [the petitioner] described and any\" statutorily protected ground. 168 F.3d at 571. Accepting Romilus's testimony as true, and assuming that the OPJP is a political organization, the record does not establish that the attackers of the OPJP meeting were motivated by a desire to suppress the OPJP's political aspirations. There is no evidence that the attackers were even aware of the OPJP. <i>See id.</i> Perhaps the best evidence in support of Romilus's argument is the seizure of the OPJP documents. The BIA might have inferred that the attackers seized those documents because they sought to disrupt the OPJP. This evidence, however, is far from conclusive. \"Where, as here[,] the constellation of facts and circumstances alleged by an asylum applicant, together with the other record evidence, supports two or more competing inferences, the IJ's choice among those inferences cannot be deemed erroneous.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Romilus failed to establish past persecution, he is not entitled to the statutory presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> 232 F.3d 258, 264 (1st Cir.2000). Nevertheless, Romilus could establish a well-founded fear of persecution if he could prove that \"a reasonable person in [his] circumstances would fear persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground.\" <i>Khalil,</i> 337 F.3d at 56 (quoting <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572). Accordingly, a well-founded fear analysis contains both a subjective and objective component: Romilus's asserted fear must be both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <i>Guzman,</i> 327 F.3d at 16 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By reversing the negative credibility determination and affirming the IJ solely on the ground that there was no nexus to a protected ground, the BIA implicitly accepted that Romilus had a subjectively genuine fear. Thus, we focus on whether a reasonable person in Romilus's circumstances would fear persecution on account of a protected ground. The record does not compel this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus claims that his wife faces continuing persecution in Haiti. His testimony on this topic, however, was ambiguous, not \"specific\" as required. <i>Id.</i> Romilus testified on direct examination that his wife had sent him an audio cassette in which she stated that she has had \"a lot of problem[s]\" since he left the country, and that she has been \"persecuted.\" But, when asked follow-up questions, Romilus provided no details other than to repeat that she has had some kind of undefined problems. Even assuming Romilus's spouse has faced persecution, his conclusory testimony is insufficient to provide any link between the persecution and a protected ground. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 573 (rejecting the probative value of letters written by persons living in the country of removal because the correspondence contained no \"specifics as to the nature of any danger, the identity of any potential malefactors, or the reasons why people might wish to harm the petitioner\"). Moreover, Romilus testified that his parents still live in Ghantier and they have suffered no harm since he left the country. <i>See id.</i> (\"[T]he fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the alien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that persecution awaits his return.\"). The BIA reasonably concluded that Romilus could be returned to Haiti without facing future persecution. Romilus has failed to establish his eligibility to be considered for the discretionary relief of asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Withholding of removal, which provides mandatory relief, imposes a higher standard than asylum. <i>INS v.

Because Romilus failed to satisfy the more lenient asylum standard, he <i>a fortiori</i> cannot satisfy the withholding of removal standard. <i>Albathani,</i> 318 F.3d at 374.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Convention Against Torture</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard for relief under the CAT is different than for asylum or withholding of removal. The applicant need not prove the reason for the torture, nor that he has a well-founded fear of being tortured. Rather, he must establish that it is \"more likely than not\" that he will be tortured if he is returned to the proposed country of removal. <i>Elien v. Ashcroft,</i> 364 F.3d 392, 398 (1st Cir.2004) (citing 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 208.16(c)(2), 208.17(a)). Unlike an asylum claim, then, there is no subjective component. To establish a prima facie claim under the CAT, an applicant must offer <i>specific objective</i> evidence showing that he will be subject to: \"(1) an act causing severe physical or mental pain or suffering; (2) intentionally inflicted; (3) for a proscribed purpose; (4) by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical control of the victim; and (5) not arising from lawful sanctions.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>In re J-E-,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 291, 297, 2002 WL 481156 (BIA 2002)); <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.18(a). Thus, an applicant must demonstrate that any torture he will suffer would be at the hands of the government or with the consent or acquiescence of the government. <i>Guzman,</i> 327 F.3d at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus contends that the absence of written analysis in the BIA's disposition of his CAT claim deprived him of due process. The BIA is not required, however, to provide a written analysis of every issue contested before the IJ. <i>See Morales v. INS,</i> 208 F.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Chen v. INS,</i> 87 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir.1996). The BIA may adopt all of or portions of the IJ's opinion. <i>See Albathani,</i> 318 F.3d at 377-78. We read the BIA's opinion as adopting the IJ's analysis of the CAT claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Thus, we will review the IJ's opinion with regard to the CAT claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ denied Romilus's CAT claim based on a lack of evidence showing that he is likely to be tortured by or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. Indeed, with the possible exception of the two incidents with the military officer, Jean Marie, there is no evidence that any of the above-mentioned incidents were instigated on behalf of, with the consent of, or with the acquiescence of the government. <i>See Guzman,</i> 327 F.3d at 17. With regard to the two incidents with Marie, the IJ reasonably found that these incidents sprang from a personal dispute. Thus, Marie was not acting in an official capacity when he assaulted Romilus. Moreover, as the IJ noted, Romilus did not experience any further problems with Marie after the two incidents in 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus argues that expert testimony and documentary evidence establish that the Haitian government sanctions attacks on democratic organizations such as the OPJP. But this evidence falls short of meeting the burden required under the CAT. None of this evidence specifically refers to Romilus or the OPJP. Moreover, even Romilus's expert witness had difficulty identifying which groups might be interested in persecuting Romilus upon his return to Haiti and whether or not those groups were connected to the government. She did testify that there are some members of the government who are involved in oppressing groups similar to the OPJP, but we would be hard pressed to find that her uncertain testimony on this point satisfies the \"more likely than not\" standard. In any event, it does not \"compel\" reversal of the IJ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus has not established that it is more likely than not that he will be subjected to torture if he is returned to Haiti.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.

We deny the petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus, a farmer from the village of Ghantier, attempted to enter the United States with a falsified passport on March 5, 1999. The INS issued a Notice to Appear, charging Romilus as removable under 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1182(a)(6)(C)(i) and 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Romilus admitted the factual allegations in the notice and conceded removability, but sought relief in the form of asylum and withholding of removal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (\"INA\"). He also applied for relief under Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basis for the claims is persecution on account of political opinion. In hearings before the Immigration Judge (\"IJ\"), Romilus testified about four incidents in support of his claims. The first two incidents involved an oral agreement he made in 1992 with Jean Marie, a military officer, to care for Marie's cow in return for an equal share of the profits from the sale of the cow. Marie's later failure to share the proceeds was followed by two physical confrontations between the two men, with Marie initiating physical contact on both occasions. Romilus has had no confrontations with Marie since then.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The third incident occurred in 1997. Romilus testified that armed men dressed in civilian clothes broke into his house while he and his wife were asleep. The armed intruders pointed a gun at his wife and demanded that she give them money she had earned as a street vendor. One of them demanded that Romilus hand over the money, also at gunpoint. Fearing for his life, Romilus surrendered the money he had hidden under his pillow. The armed men took the money and left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fourth incident involved a grassroots community organization called the Organization for the Progress of the Young People (\"OPJP\"). Romilus joined the OPJP in 1998 and was made a delegate of the organization. The OPJP consisted of 15 founding members, all from Ghantier, and was led by a man named Louis Blaise. According to Romilus, the OPJP is a \"progressive movement for young people seeking to make democratic changes in Haiti,\" and its goals include improving the local community by building new schools, healthcare facilities, and making clean water available for drinking and farming. Romilus testified that the OPJP seeks government cooperation and the participation of local residents, although not all the townspeople support the organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus testified that an OPJP meeting was held at the Ghantier schoolhouse on January 31, 1999. Blaise was addressing a crowd of approximately 250 to 300 people when an unspecified number of armed men, dressed in civilian clothes, entered the school and began physically assaulting the people in attendance. The assailants beat attendees with their weapons and fists and shot Blaise in the arm. Romilus himself was struck in the jaw and lost two teeth. The intruders also seized OPJP documents. Romilus was unable to identify any of the men who broke up the meeting because many of them wore masks and none wore a uniform.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus fled the scene and ran toward his home. En route he was stopped by his neighbors who told him that his house had been set on fire and that armed men were waiting for him. Fearing for his life, Romilus hid in the woods. He remained in hiding, sleeping in churches and schoolhouses, until he departed Haiti in March. Nobody informed the police about the attack on the schoolhouse, and no newspaper reported the incident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While Romilus was in hiding, his parents helped to obtain a French passport and a plane ticket for him. Romilus departed Port-au-Prince, Haiti, and entered the United States at Miami International Airport. After his arrival in the United States, Romilus received an audio cassette tape from his wife. According to Romilus, his wife states in the tape that since he left Haiti she has experienced \"problems,\" she has been \"persecuted,\" and that, as a result of her persecution, she was forced to leave the house where she was living. Romilus testified that his parents also continue to live in Haiti, and that they have not been harmed since he left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus submitted background documentary evidence concerning country conditions and the often unstable political climate in Haiti.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Romilus's expert witness, Marlye Gelin-Adams, provided background information concerning Haiti's many local grassroots organizations. She did not, however, have any personal knowledge of the OPJP. She stated that there are some members of the government who view these grassroots organizations as a threat to their power because they exert pressure on the government to remain democratic and to honor Haiti's constitution. Additionally, she testified that there are non-governmental groups operating in Haiti that oppose the pro-democracy grassroots organizations. According to Adams, \"armed thugs\" from some of these non-governmental factions have attacked and threatened members of the pro-democracy organizations, and the national police has had trouble controlling the violence because its numbers are small and its officers are inexperienced or violent themselves.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an oral decision, the IJ denied Romilus's application for asylum and withholding of removal. The IJ found that the two incidents involving the military officer, Jean Marie, were simply the consequence of a personal dispute and were not prompted by any of the statutorily protected grounds. Similarly, the IJ found that the robbery at Romilus's home was economically motivated and not linked to any protected ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the fourth incident, the IJ found no evidence that the OPJP was a political player in Haiti. Based on Romilus's testimony, the IJ viewed the OPJP as a community organization created to improve living conditions for the local populace, and that it was merely Romilus's personal perception that the organization might also support his beliefs in establishing democracy in Haiti. With regard to the attack on the OPJP meeting, the IJ found it critical that Romilus could neither identify the attackers nor testify to what, if anything, the attackers said during their raid. Therefore, the IJ declined to impute any political motive to the raid.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on these findings, the IJ concluded that Romilus had failed to show past persecution on account of a protected ground. The IJ also found that Romilus had not established a well-founded fear of future persecution because his testimony was not credible. Having failed to establish eligibility for asylum, the IJ found that Romilus could not meet the burden for withholding of removal. Finally, the IJ found that Romilus did not present any evidence that a government official or any other person acting in an official capacity \"has any interest in [him].\" Therefore, Romilus had failed to meet his burden of proof under the CAT.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus timely appealed to the BIA. In a per curiam decision, the BIA agreed with Romilus that the IJ's adverse credibility determination was erroneous. Nevertheless, the BIA affirmed the denial of asylum and withholding of removal, agreeing with the IJ that Romilus had \"not shown a nexus between the harm he suffered and one of the five [protected] grounds.\" The BIA also affirmed, without discussion, the IJ's denial of relief under the Torture Convention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II.

Discussion</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus argues that the BIA committed four reversible errors: (1) concluding that the OPJP is not a political organization; (2) concluding that the harm he suffered was not on account of his political opinion; (3) affirming the IJ's denial of asylum and withholding of removal; and (4) depriving Romilus of due process by neglecting to adjudicate his claim for relief under the CAT. Regarding the first issue, because we find the classification of the OPJP is not dispositive in this case, we will assume, for purposes of analysis and without deciding, that the OPJP is a political organization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Asylum and Withholding of Removal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 208(a) of the INA authorizes the Attorney General to exercise his discretion to grant asylum to eligible refugee aliens. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1159(a). The alien bears the burden of establishing eligibility for asylum by proving that he qualifies as a refugee. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(b)(1); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(a). A \"refugee\" is any person who is unable or unwilling to return to his country of nationality or avail himself of that country's protection because he has suffered past persecution in that country or has a well-founded fear of future persecution in that country. 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A). To prove past persecution, an applicant must provide \"conclusive evidence\" that he has suffered persecution on one of five protected grounds: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. <i>Albathani,</i> 318 F.3d at 373; <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(1). \"To establish a well-founded fear of future persecution, applicants can offer specific proof, or they can claim the benefit of a regulatory presumption based on proof of past persecution.\" <i>Khalil v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200567\"><a href=\"/opinion/200567/khalil-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></a></span>, 55 (1st Cir.2003) (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus's asylum application relies on four incidents: the two confrontations with Jean Marie, the robbery, and the raid on the OPJP meeting and subsequent burning down of Romilus's house. Substantial evidence supports the BIA's conclusion that Romilus failed to show a sufficient nexus between the harm he suffered on these occasions and one of the five grounds protected by the INA. Since the BIA's discussion of the nexus requirement implicitly adopts the IJ's findings on that issue, we will review the BIA's decision in conjunction with the IJ's findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to the first two incidents, the record supports the IJ's conclusion that the hostilities between Romilus and Marie arose from a purely personal dispute. Marie breached an oral agreement with Romilus and, when confronted by Romilus, reacted with violence. There is no evidence that Marie threatened Romilus because of his political opinion. In fact, these incidents occurred years before Romilus joined the OPJP. The INA is not intended to protect aliens from violence based on personal animosity. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With regard to the 1997 incident, the IJ did not err in concluding that the robbery was economically motivated: Romilus's wife was a local street vendor who collected money daily from her sales, the money was kept in their house, the robbers wore civilian clothes, when Romilus surrendered the money the armed robbers went away, and the robbers said nothing apart from demanding the money. Romilus claims that his house was \"targeted,\" but nothing in the record compels the conclusion that the targeting was based on Romilus's political affiliation. Indeed, a logical reading of the record leads to the conclusion that Romilus's house was targeted because it was public knowledge that his wife had money from her market business. <i>See Albathani,</i> 318 F.3d at 373 (the two alleged incidents of persecution \"may well have been, as the IJ suggested, nothing more than the robbery of someone driving a Mercedes with cash in his pocket\"). And again, this robbery occurred <i>before</i> Romilus joined the OPJP.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The 1999 raid of the OPJP meeting, and the subsequent burning of Romilus's house, present a closer question. The BIA found it critical that Romilus had failed to identify the attackers or to articulate any motive for the attack. In response Romilus argues, correctly, that he is not required to identify his persecutors. <i>See Gailius v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198026\"><a href=\"/opinion/198026/ins-v-gailius/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Cordero-Trejo v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195749\"><a href=\"/opinion/195749/cordero-trejo-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">40</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">482</span></a></span>, 488 (1st Cir.1994). Nor is he required to establish their exact motivations. <i>Elias-Zacarias,</i> 502 U.S. at 483, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112682\"><a href=\"/opinion/112682/ins-v-elias-zacarias/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">812</span></a></span>. But he is required to \"provide <i>some</i> evidence of [their motivations], direct or circumstantial.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in original). The BIA found that Romilus failed to produce sufficient evidence in this regard, and we cannot say that a contrary finding was compelled by the record evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus argues that his case is akin to <i>Cordero-Trejo.</i> In that case, we held that an asylum applicant could not be discredited for failing to identify his persecutors when they were part of a group that was \"unofficial and `clandestine'\" and were \"by definition `unknown.'\" 40 F.3d at 488. But that opinion went on to explain that \"the only way [such clandestine persecutors] are knowable, i.e., distinguishable from mere bandits and criminals, is by the threats and indications of motive that typically precede or accompany their violence.\" <i>Id.</i> In contrast to <i>Cordero-Trejo,</i> here there is no evidence that the attackers demanded Romilus to \"discontinue his activities with\" the OPJP, nor that he received \"warnings of future violence should he disregard\" those demands. <i>Id.</i> In our view, the present case is more comparable to <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> where we held that the petitioner's evidence of persecution \"lacked the requisite degree of specificity\" necessary to establish \"a sufficient nexus between the events that [the petitioner] described and any\" statutorily protected ground. 168 F.3d at 571. Accepting Romilus's testimony as true, and assuming that the OPJP is a political organization, the record does not establish that the attackers of the OPJP meeting were motivated by a desire to suppress the OPJP's political aspirations. There is no evidence that the attackers were even aware of the OPJP. <i>See id.</i> Perhaps the best evidence in support of Romilus's argument is the seizure of the OPJP documents. The BIA might have inferred that the attackers seized those documents because they sought to disrupt the OPJP. This evidence, however, is far from conclusive. \"Where, as here[,] the constellation of facts and circumstances alleged by an asylum applicant, together with the other record evidence, supports two or more competing inferences, the IJ's choice among those inferences cannot be deemed erroneous.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since Romilus failed to establish past persecution, he is not entitled to the statutory presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>Nelson v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771091\"><a href=\"/opinion/771091/laeila-nelson-stephanie-nelson-phil-nelson-v-immigration-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">232</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">258</span></a></span>, 264 (1st Cir.2000). Nevertheless, Romilus could establish a well-founded fear of persecution if he could prove that \"a reasonable person in [his] circumstances would fear persecution on account of a statutorily protected ground.\" <i>Khalil,</i> 337 F.3d at 56 (quoting <i>Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 572). Accordingly, a well-founded fear analysis contains both a subjective and objective component: Romilus's asserted fear must be both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <i>Guzman,</i> 327 F.3d at 16 (citations omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By reversing the negative credibility determination and affirming the IJ solely on the ground that there was no nexus to a protected ground, the BIA implicitly accepted that Romilus had a subjectively genuine fear. Thus, we focus on whether a reasonable person in Romilus's circumstances would fear persecution on account of a protected ground. The record does not compel this conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus claims that his wife faces continuing persecution in Haiti. His testimony on this topic, however, was ambiguous, not \"specific\" as required. <i>Id.</i> Romilus testified on direct examination that his wife had sent him an audio cassette in which she stated that she has had \"a lot of problem[s]\" since he left the country, and that she has been \"persecuted.\" But, when asked follow-up questions, Romilus provided no details other than to repeat that she has had some kind of undefined problems. Even assuming Romilus's spouse has faced persecution, his conclusory testimony is insufficient to provide any link between the persecution and a protected ground. <i>See Aguilar-Solis,</i> 168 F.3d at 573 (rejecting the probative value of letters written by persons living in the country of removal because the correspondence contained no \"specifics as to the nature of any danger, the identity of any potential malefactors, or the reasons why people might wish to harm the petitioner\"). Moreover, Romilus testified that his parents still live in Ghantier and they have suffered no harm since he left the country. <i>See id.</i> (\"[T]he fact that close relatives continue to live peacefully in the alien's homeland undercuts the alien's claim that persecution awaits his return.\"). The BIA reasonably concluded that Romilus could be returned to Haiti without facing future persecution. Romilus has failed to establish his eligibility to be considered for the discretionary relief of asylum.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Withholding of removal, which provides mandatory relief, imposes a higher standard than asylum. <i>INS v. Aguirre-Aguirre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118284\"><a href=\"/opinion/118284/ins-v-aguirre-aguirre/\"><span class=\"volume\">526</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span>, 419, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118284\"><a href=\"/opinion/118284/ins-v-aguirre-aguirre/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">590</span></a></span> (1999) (an applicant for withholding of removal must prove that it is \"more likely than not\" that he would be subject to persecution on account of a protected ground). Because Romilus failed to satisfy the more lenient asylum standard, he <i>a fortiori</i> cannot satisfy the withholding of removal standard. <i>Albathani,</i> 318 F.3d at 374.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Convention Against Torture</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard for relief under the CAT is different than for asylum or withholding of removal. The applicant need not prove the reason for the torture, nor that he has a well-founded fear of being tortured. Rather, he must establish that it is \"more likely than not\" that he will be tortured if he is returned to the proposed country of removal. <i>Elien v. Ashcroft,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200971\"><a href=\"/opinion/200971/elien-v-john-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">364</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">392</span></a></span>, 398 (1st Cir.2004) (citing 8 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 208.16(c)(2), 208.17(a)). Unlike an asylum claim, then, there is no subjective component. To establish a prima facie claim under the CAT, an applicant must offer <i>specific objective</i> evidence showing that he will be subject to: \"(1) an act causing severe physical or mental pain or suffering; (2) intentionally inflicted; (3) for a proscribed purpose; (4) by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official who has custody or physical control of the victim; and (5) not arising from lawful sanctions.\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>In re J-E-,</i> 23 I. &amp; N. Dec. 291, 297, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">481156</span></span> (BIA 2002)); <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.18(a). Thus, an applicant must demonstrate that any torture he will suffer would be at the hands of the government or with the consent or acquiescence of the government. <i>Guzman,</i> 327 F.3d at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus contends that the absence of written analysis in the BIA's disposition of his CAT claim deprived him of due process. The BIA is not required, however, to provide a written analysis of every issue contested before the IJ. <i>See Morales v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768205\"><a href=\"/opinion/768205/juan-antonio-morales-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">208</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">323</span></a></span>, 328 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Chen v.

The BIA may adopt all of or portions of the IJ's opinion. <i>See Albathani,</i> 318 F.3d at 377-78. We read the BIA's opinion as adopting the IJ's analysis of the CAT claim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Thus, we will review the IJ's opinion with regard to the CAT claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ denied Romilus's CAT claim based on a lack of evidence showing that he is likely to be tortured by or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity. Indeed, with the possible exception of the two incidents with the military officer, Jean Marie, there is no evidence that any of the above-mentioned incidents were instigated on behalf of, with the consent of, or with the acquiescence of the government. <i>See Guzman,</i> 327 F.3d at 17. With regard to the two incidents with Marie, the IJ reasonably found that these incidents sprang from a personal dispute. Thus, Marie was not acting in an official capacity when he assaulted Romilus. Moreover, as the IJ noted, Romilus did not experience any further problems with Marie after the two incidents in 1994.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus argues that expert testimony and documentary evidence establish that the Haitian government sanctions attacks on democratic organizations such as the OPJP. But this evidence falls short of meeting the burden required under the CAT. None of this evidence specifically refers to Romilus or the OPJP. Moreover, even Romilus's expert witness had difficulty identifying which groups might be interested in persecuting Romilus upon his return to Haiti and whether or not those groups were connected to the government. She did testify that there are some members of the government who are involved in oppressing groups similar to the OPJP, but we would be hard pressed to find that her uncertain testimony on this point satisfies the \"more likely than not\" standard. In any event, it does not \"compel\" reversal of the IJ.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Romilus has not established that it is more likely than not that he will be subjected to torture if he is returned to Haiti.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV.
