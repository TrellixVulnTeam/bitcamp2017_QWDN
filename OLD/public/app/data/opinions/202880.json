Raymond L. Acosta, Senior U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                  Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Eli B. Arroyo on brief for appellant.\n     Juan M. Frontera-Suau on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 7, 2007\n\f            SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge.         In this age discrimination\n\ncase, plaintiff-appellant Ernesto Dávila challenges the entry of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of his former employer, defendant-\n\nappellee Corporación de Puerto Rico para la Difusión Pública (the\n\nStation).    Discerning no reversible error, we affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            The critical facts are uncomplicated.              The Station is\n\nPuerto Rico's public broadcasting outlet.              On August 1, 2000, it\n\nhired the appellant as a temporary worker in its engineering\n\ndepartment. One month later, the appellant received an appointment\n\nas chief engineer, subject, however, to an explicit 10-month\n\nprobationary period. During that interval, the appellant was to be\n\ntrained in the duties of the position and periodically evaluated.\n\n            Evaluations were conducted on three occasions during the\n\nprobationary period: in December 2000, March 2001, and May 2001.\n\nThese reviews, composed by the Station's director of engineering,\n\nJorge E. González-Fonseca, were generally unfavorable.                  According\n\nto González-Fonseca, the appellant lacked a working knowledge of\n\nthe Station's equipment, neglected to complete his assigned tasks\n\nin   a   timely   manner,   and   proved    to   be    in   constant     need   of\n\ninstruction.\n\n            Relying on these negative evaluations, the Station's\n\npresident,    Linda   Hernández,    chose    not      to   extend   a   permanent\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fappointment       to   the    appellant    and,    instead,    terminated        his\n\nemployment at the end of the probationary period.\n\n            The    appellant     sued,    asserting    that   the   Station      had\n\ndiscriminated against him because of his age in violation of the\n\nAge Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634,\n\nand Puerto Rico's anti-discrimination statute, P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n29,   §   146   (Law   100).     He   claimed     in   substance    that   he    was\n\nterminated solely because González-Fonseca thought he was too old\n\nfor the job.       The Station denied the pivotal allegations of the\n\ncomplaint.\n\n            At the conclusion of discovery, the Station moved for\n\nsummary judgment.        See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.           The district court\n\ngranted the motion over the appellant's objection, concluding that\n\nthere was no probative evidence of discriminatory animus.                  Dávila\n\nv. Corporación de P.R. para la Difusión Pública, Civ. No. 04-2002,\n\n2006 WL 2092570 (D.P.R. July 26, 2006).            As an alternative ground,\n\nthe district court ruled that the Station was immune from the\n\nappellant's claims for damages.           See U.S. Const. amend. XI.            This\n\ntimely appeal ensued.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n            We subdivide our analysis into several segments.               First,\n\nwe briefly limn the standard of review and, relatedly, the summary\n\njudgment standard.           Next, we deal with an evidentiary question\n\nconcerning certain untranslated Spanish-language documents. Third,\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fwe explain why we eschew any inquiry into the question of Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity.   When these preliminaries have been completed,\n\nwe turn to the merits of the discrimination claims.\n\n                               A.   Standards.\n\n           We review a district court's entry of summary judgment de\n\nnovo.    See Iverson v. City of Boston, 452 F.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).   Like the district court, we must take the facts of record\n\nin the light most flattering to the nonmovant (here, the appellant)\n\nand draw all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.           See id.\n\n           The   object   of    summary    judgment   is   \"to   pierce   the\n\nboilerplate of the pleadings and assay the parties' proof in order\n\nto determine whether trial is actually required.\"           Acosta v. Ames\n\nDep't Stores, Inc., 386 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Wynne v.\n\nTufts Univ. Sch. of Med., 976 F.2d 791, 794 (1st Cir. 1992)).\n\nThus, summary judgment is appropriate only when the record \"show[s]\n\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the\n\nmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"           Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 56(c).\n\n           For this purpose, an issue is genuine if \"a reasonable\n\njury could resolve the point in favor of the nonmoving party.\"\n\nSuárez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc., 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir. 2000).             By\n\nlike token, a fact is material if it has the potential to determine\n\nthe outcome of the litigation.       See Calvi v. Knox County, 470 F.3d\n\n422, 426 (1st Cir. 2006).       Where, as here, the nonmovant has the\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fburden of proof and the evidence on one or more of the critical\n\nissues in the case \"is . . . not significantly probative, summary\n\njudgment may be granted.\"        Acosta, 386 F.3d at 8 (quoting Anderson\n\nv. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50 (1986)).\n\n                    B.    Spanish-Language Documents.\n\n           We next address a threshold matter.              In support of its\n\nmotion for summary judgment, the Station submitted an array of\n\npapers.     These     included     several      Spanish-language     documents\n\nunaccompanied by corresponding English translations. Submission of\n\nthese documents contravened a local rule requiring all litigation\n\npapers to be submitted in English.                 See D.P.R.R. 10(b).        The\n\ndistrict court granted the Station leave to file these Spanish-\n\nlanguage   writings      but    ordered    certified     translations   to     be\n\nfurnished within one month's time.             The Station failed to comply.\n\n           More   than    two    months    after    ordering   the   filing    of\n\ntranslations, the district court entered summary judgment for the\n\nStation.   Dávila, 2006 WL 2092570, at *7.               In its decision, the\n\ncourt did not allude to the missing translations.               The appellant\n\ncontends   that   the     rendering       of   summary    judgment   with     the\n\nuntranslated documents in the record constituted reversible error.\n\n           \"It is well settled that federal litigation in Puerto\n\nRico [must] be conducted in English.\"                 González-De-Blasini v.\n\nFamily Dep't, 377 F.3d 81, 88 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation and\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted); see 48 U.S.C. § 864 (requiring\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fthat \"all pleadings and proceedings in the United States District\n\nCourt for the District of Puerto Rico . . . be conducted in the\n\nEnglish language\"). When a district court accepts foreign-language\n\ndocuments without the required English translations, an appellate\n\ncourt cannot consider the untranslated documents on appeal.            See\n\nEstades-Negroni v. Assocs. Corp. of N. Am., 359 F.3d 1, 2-3 (1st\n\nCir. 2004); Fed. R. App. P. 10.          Where the record shows that\n\nEnglish translations were used in the trial court but somehow were\n\nnot put into the record as they should have been, the parties may\n\ninvoke Fed. R. App. P. 10 to correct the record.       See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Vazquez Guadalupe, 407 F.3d 492, 498 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nThat is not the situation here.    If the untranslated documents are\n\nor may be essential to the resolution of an issue raised on appeal,\n\nand are not subject to cure by means of Fed. R. App. P. 10, the\n\nlack of translation may undermine meaningful appellate review.\n\nUnited States v. Rivera-Rosario, 300 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n          The documents in question here, translations of which\n\nhave been made available on appeal, consist of the appellant's\n\nperformance   evaluations,   letters    from   the   Station's   president\n\nnotifying him of his appointment and termination respectively, and\n\nexcerpts from his deposition testimony. It is crystal clear that\n\nnone of these documents bear on any of the issues that the court\n\nfound dispositive in adjudicating the summary judgment motion.          In\n\nany event, in addition to the untranslated documents, the Station\n\n\n                                  -6-\n\fsubmitted other documents with its motion for summary judgment.\n\nThese included a sworn statement, in English, from Nancy Piñero,\n\nthe director of the Station's legal division.           In that statement,\n\nPiñero summarized the contents of the appellant's personnel file,\n\nincluding the three performance reviews.               Whatever additional\n\ninformation might exist in the untranslated documents is wholly\n\nextraneous and, therefore, inconsequential to the district court's\n\nresolution of the matter.       In short, the existence of the Piñero\n\nstatement makes it readily evident that nothing contained in the\n\ndocuments had any bearing on the district court's ratio decidendi.\n\n          That   ends    this   aspect    of   the   matter.    Because   the\n\nuntranslated documents had no potential to affect the disposition\n\nof the case at the summary judgment stage, we conclude that the\n\nmere presence of the untranslated documents in the district court\n\nrecord cannot support a claim of reversible error.             See González-\n\nDe-Blasini, 377 F.3d at 89.\n\n                 C.     Eleventh Amendment Immunity.\n\n          The district court found, as an alternate ground of\n\ndecision, that the Station enjoys Eleventh Amendment immunity. The\n\nappellant not only disputes that finding but also advances a claim\n\nof waiver.\n\n          This contretemps might easily be mistaken as a threshold\n\nissue.   After all, the Eleventh Amendment has been described as\n\nimplicating subject-matter jurisdiction. See, e.g., Wis. Dep't of\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fCorr.    v.    Schacht,   524   U.S.   381,       394    (1998)   (Kennedy,   J.,\n\nconcurring).       This is potentially important because, in many\n\ninstances,      colorable   challenges       to    a    court's   subject-matter\n\njurisdiction must be adjudicated prior to adjudicating the merits\n\nof a case.     See Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't, 523 U.S.\n\n83, 93-95 (1998).\n\n              Here, however, controlling circuit precedent allows us to\n\ndefer thorny Eleventh Amendment questions in cases in which it is\n\nperfectly clear that the state entity will prevail on the merits.1\n\nSee Parella v. Ret. Bd. of R.I. Employees' Ret. Sys., 173 F.3d 46,\n\n53-57 (1st Cir. 1999).          This is such a case.          Consequently, we\n\navail ourselves of this bypass option and proceed directly to the\n\nmerits of the appellant's claims.\n\n                                D.   The Merits.\n\n              The appellant seeks to recover on three causes of action.\n\nFirst, he claims that the Station violated his procedural due\n\nprocess rights in failing to provide him with notice and a hearing\n\nprior to his discharge.          Second, he claims that his ouster was\n\npredicated on age and, thus, violated the ADEA.               Third, he recasts\n\nhis federal age discrimination claim in the idiom of Law 100.                 We\n\ndeal with each cause of action in turn.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      For purposes of the Eleventh Amendment, Puerto Rico is the\nfunctional equivalent of a state. See Espinal-Dominguez v. Puerto\nRico, 352 F.3d 490, 494 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n                                       -8-\n\f            1.   Due Process.   The appellant asserts, for the first\n\ntime on appeal, that the Station abridged his procedural due\n\nprocess rights by failing to grant him notice and an opportunity to\n\nbe heard prior to cashiering him.       Although he concedes that a\n\nprobationary employee has no such rights, see, e.g., Somers v. City\n\nof Minneapolis, 245 F.3d 782, 785 (8th Cir. 2001), he posits that\n\nhe had moved from probationary status to career status before the\n\nax fell.\n\n            The appellant bases this proposition on a statute that\n\nprovides in pertinent part that a probatory work contract \"in no\n\ncase shall exceed three (3) months.\"      P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, §\n\n185(h).    The statute further declares that, \"should the employee\n\ncontinue to work for the employer after the term established in the\n\nprobatory work contract, said employee shall acquire all the rights\n\nof an employee.\"     Id.   The appellant takes this to mean that the\n\n10-month probationary period to which he subscribed was illegal and\n\nthat he attained the status of a permanent employee after occupying\n\nthe chief engineer position for three months and one day.\n\n            This is an interesting argument, but it comes as an\n\nafterthought.     The appellant did not present it to the district\n\ncourt.    The argument is, therefore, forfeited.2   See United States\n\n\n     2\n      The Station argues that the appellant waived this argument by\nnot raising it before the district court. We do not agree. A\nparty waives a right only if he intentionally relinquishes or\nabandons it; he forfeits a right by failing to assert it in a\ntimely manner.    See United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 733\n\n                                  -9-\n\fv. Leahy, 473 F.3d 401, 409-10 (1st Cir. 2007).                    We review\n\nforfeited issues for plain error.           See id. at 410.      Plain error\n\nreview is not appellant-friendly; we will resuscitate a forfeited\n\nargument only if the appellant demonstrates that \"(1) an error\n\noccurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3)\n\naffected    the   [appellant's]     substantial    rights,   but   also   (4)\n\nseriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\nthe judicial proceedings.\"        United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56,\n\n60 (1st Cir. 2001).      As we explain below, the appellant in this\n\ncase cannot satisfy this exacting standard.\n\n            The Station was created by statute as an independent\n\npublic service corporation.       See Public Broadcasting Corporation,\n\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, §§ 501-513.           Pursuant to this statutory\n\nscheme, the Station is authorized to \"adopt, amend and repeal\n\nregulations to govern its affairs and activities.\"            Id. § 504(3).\n\nIt is also authorized to \"appoint and contract . . . employees . .\n\n.   in    accordance   with   the    personnel     regulations     that   are\n\npromulgated.\"     Id. § 504(11).\n\n            Exercising   these    powers,    the   Station   promulgated    a\n\ncomprehensive set of regulations. See P.R. Reg. No. 5468 (July 13,\n\n1995).     Pertinently, one of those regulations provides that the\n\n\n\n(1993);   United States v. Rodriguez, 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir.\n2002).    Because the argument in question was not identified in any\nform or    fashion below, the appellant could not be said, on this\nrecord,   to have intentionally abandoned it.\n\n                                    -10-\n\fduration of a probationary work period for a Station recruit can be\n\nbetween three months and one year.         See id. § 8.9(2).\n\n            This    regulation,    which      validates    the    10-month\n\nprobationary period contained in the appellant's contract, arguably\n\nconflicts   with   section   185(h)   in   that   it   purports   to   allow\n\nprobationary periods longer than three months. The question, then,\n\nreduces to whether the Puerto Rico legislature intended the general\n\nstatute — section 185(h) — to restrict the latitude that it gave to\n\nthe Station in an entity-specific statute. There is no controlling\n\ncase law to guide us on how to navigate our way through such a\n\nconflict.   As a result, the answer to the nuanced question that the\n\nappellant's argument poses is not immediately obvious.\n\n            That is game, set, and match.         The lack of any clear,\n\neasily determinable answer to a legal conundrum is, in itself,\n\nenough to defeat a claim of plain error.            See United States v.\n\nCordoza-Estrada, 385 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2004). Accordingly, we\n\nreject the appellant's procedural due process claim.\n\n            2.   ADEA.   The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer to\n\n\"discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any\n\nindividual . . . because of such individual's age.\"            29 U.S.C. §\n\n623(a)(1); see Suárez, 229 F.3d at 53.        The appellant alleges that\n\nhis discharge transgressed this proscription.\n\n            When an employee claims to have been discharged in\n\nviolation of the ADEA, he must shoulder the ultimate \"burden of\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\fproving   that   his   years   were   the    determinative     factor    in   his\n\ndischarge, that is, that he would not have been fired but for his\n\nage.\"   Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 823 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(quoting Freeman v. Package Mach. Co., 865 F.2d 1331, 1335 (1st\n\nCir. 1988)).     The Supreme Court has developed a burden-shifting\n\nframework to facilitate the process of proving discrimination in\n\nthe absence of direct evidence.          See McDonnell Douglas Corp. v.\n\nGreen, 411 U.S. 792, 802-05 (1973), see also Sanchez v. P.R. Oil\n\nCo., 37 F.3d 712, 718-20 (1st Cir. 1994) (applying that framework\n\nin an ADEA case).\n\n           The initial burden lies with the plaintiff to demonstrate\n\na prima facie case of discrimination.                 See, e.g., Velázquez-\n\nFernández v. NCE Foods, Inc., 476 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir. 2007).                 To\n\nsatisfy this burden, the plaintiff must produce evidence showing\n\nfour facts: (i) that he was at least forty years old when shown the\n\ndoor; (ii) that his job performance met or exceeded the employer's\n\nlegitimate   expectations;     (iii)    that    his    employer   actually    or\n\nconstructively discharged him; and (iv) that his employer had a\n\ncontinuing need for the services he formerly furnished.                 See id.;\n\nSuárez, 229 F.3d at 53.\n\n           Here,   the   first,   third,       and    fourth   prongs    of   the\n\nappellant's prima facie case are not in dispute.                  The Station\n\nacknowledges that the appellant was in the protected age group on\n\nMay 31, 2000; it admits that it terminated his employment on that\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\fdate;   and    it   concedes   that      it    hired   a   replacement     upon    the\n\nappellant's departure.         There is a substantial question as to\n\nwhether the appellant has satisfied the second element but we\n\nassume for the sake of argument that he has made the requisite\n\nshowing.\n\n              Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, a\n\npresumption of discrimination arises and the burden of production\n\nshifts to the employer to proffer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory\n\nreason for the discharge.           See Rivera-Aponte v. Rest. Metro. #3,\n\nInc., 338 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 2003).               The employer's burden is not\n\na   burden     of   persuasion;    the     employer     need   do    no   more    than\n\narticulate a reason which, on its face, would justify a conclusion\n\nthat the plaintiff was let go for a nondiscriminatory motive.                      See\n\nSanchez, 37 F.3d at 720; Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 823.\n\n              In this instance, the Station asserted, through the sworn\n\nstatement of Piñero, that the appellant was terminated because of\n\npoor    work    performance       during      his    probationary     stint.      This\n\nstatement, by itself, provides sufficient basis for the district\n\ncourt's conclusion that the Station articulated a nondisciminatory\n\nmotive for the appellant's discharge.                See Douglas v. J.C. Penney\n\nCo., Inc., 474 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2007); Woodman v. Haemonetics\n\nCorp., 51 F.3d 1087, 1092 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n              When, as in this case, the employer produces a facially\n\nadequate      explanation   for     the       discharge,    the     presumption    of\n\n\n                                         -13-\n\fdiscrimination        created     by    the   plaintiff's       prima    facie   case\n\ndisappears     from    view.       See    Ramírez    Rodríguez      v.    Boehringer\n\nIngelheim Pharm., Inc., 425 F.3d 67, 78 (1st Cir. 2005).                     At that\n\njuncture, the burden reverts to the plaintiff, who must show that\n\nthe \"reason given by the employer for the discharge is pretextual,\n\nand,   moreover,      that   it    is    pretext    for   age     discrimination.\"\n\nSanchez, 37 F.3d at 720.          In other words, the bottom-line question\n\nof discrimination vel non comes front and center.                        See Ramírez\n\nRodríguez, 425 F.3d at 78; Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt & Colman, Inc.,\n\n277 F.3d 40, 45 (1st Cir. 2002).                    At summary judgment, this\n\nquestion reduces to whether or not the plaintiff has adduced\n\nminimally sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable factfinder to\n\nconclude that he was fired because of his age.                           See Ramírez\n\nRodríguez, 425 F.3d at 78; Zapata-Matos, 277 F.3d at 45.\n\n              Here, the appellant endeavors to carry this burden by\n\nshowing that the Station's proffered reason was a pretext and that\n\nhe was actually cashiered because of his age.               His efforts take two\n\nforms.       First, he tries to discredit his negative performance\n\nevaluations.         Second, he cites office gossip as a basis for\n\nconcluding that the Station wanted to get rid of him because of his\n\nage.    Neither offering bears fruit.\n\n              The appellant's claim that his work performance was\n\nunfairly evaluated rests on three supporting allegations: that he\n\nwas    not   given    adequate     training;       that   the    reviews    were   an\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\finaccurate reflection of his performance; and that González-Fonseca\n\nwas unqualified to compile the reviews because he did not hold an\n\nengineering license.     This is whistling past the graveyard.      These\n\nallegations, even if true, would indicate no more than that the\n\nappellant's dismissal was unfair or unwise; they would not indicate\n\nage discrimination.      We explain briefly.\n\n          When assessing a claim of pretext in an employment\n\ndiscrimination   case,    a   court's   focus   is   necessarily   on   the\n\nmotivations and perceptions of the decisionmaker.           Mesnick, 950\n\nF.2d at 824.     Thus, as long as the Station believed that the\n\nappellant's performance was not up to snuff — and the appellant has\n\npresented no evidence suggesting that management thought otherwise\n\n— it is not our province to second-guess a decision to fire him as\n\na poor performer.3       That is true regardless of whether, to an\n\nobjective observer, the decision would seem wise or foolish,\n\ncorrect or incorrect, sound or arbitrary. See Velázquez-Fernández,\n\n476 F.3d at 12; see also Mesnick, 950 F.2d at 825 (explaining that\n\n\"courts may not sit as super personnel departments, assessing the\n\nmerits . . . of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions\").\n\nFor a quondam employee to withstand summary judgment in an age\n\ndiscrimination case, there must be some significantly probative\n\n\n\n     3\n      There is no evidence that management relied on biased\ninformation from an employee who demonstrably possessed a\ndiscriminatory animus. See Cariglia v. Hertz Equip. Rental Corp.\n363 F.3d 77, 85-88 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                  -15-\n\fevidence from which the factfinder can infer that the employer\n\ndischarged   the    employee    because       of   his   age.     See   Reeves   v.\n\nSanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 146-47 (2000).\n\nProof of pretext may give rise to such an inference; proof of a\n\nmistaken judgment does not.\n\n          This brings us to the appellant's other evidence of age\n\ndiscrimination: his own affidavit, in which he asserted that\n\nseveral unidentified co-workers had told him that González-Fonseca\n\nbelieved that he (the appellant) \"was too old to hold the position\n\nof Chief Engineer.\"\n\n          The      district    court   refused      to    give   weight   to   this\n\nstatement, and so do we.         The appellant offered the statement to\n\nprove the truth of the matter asserted; that is, that González-\n\nFonseca believed the appellant was too old for the job.                   But the\n\nappellant had no personal knowledge of any conversations between\n\nGonzález-Fonseca and his co-workers, and none of the co-workers\n\nsigned an affidavit or gave a deposition in which the contents of\n\nany such conversations were disclosed. Consequently, the statement\n\nwas hearsay.    See Fed. R. Evid. 801(c).                It is black-letter law\n\nthat hearsay evidence cannot be considered on summary judgment.\n\nSee Vazquez v. Lopez-Rosario, 134 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir. 1998);\n\nGarside v. Osco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 1990); see\n\nalso Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(e).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f            In an effort to salvage this evidence, the appellant\n\nlabors to persuade us that the crucial statement is excluded from\n\nthe operation of the hearsay rule by either the exception for\n\nparty-opponent      admissions        or    the    exception         for   present     sense\n\nimpressions.       We are not convinced.\n\n            For a statement to qualify as an admission by a party-\n\nopponent,    the    statement     must       be    made   by     a    party,     a   person\n\nauthorized by the party to make statements on its behalf concerning\n\nthe subject, or the party's agent or servant acting within the\n\nscope of his or her agency or employment.                            See Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2); see also McDonough v. City of Quincy, 452 F.3d 8, 21\n\n(1st Cir. 2006).         While González-Fonseca would fit within this\n\ntaxonomy,    he    did   not    make       the    statement    in      question      to   the\n\nappellant;    rather,     he     is    alleged       to   have       made   it    to      some\n\nunidentified co-workers.              Thus, unless these co-workers were of\n\nsufficient stature to bind the Station, the statement is clearly\n\ninadmissible as a mere third-party account of what González-Fonseca\n\nis alleged to have said.\n\n            The appellant cannot clear this hurdle.                          He did not\n\nidentify his sources and, without that information, there is no\n\nreliable way to tell whether they fit within any of the Rule\n\n801(d)(2) categories.          Therefore, the statement was not admissible\n\non this basis.       See Orta-Castro v. Merck, Sharp & Dohme Química\n\nP.R., Inc., 447 F.3d 105, 114 (1st Cir. 2006); see also Lopez-\n\n\n                                            -17-\n\fRosario,   134     F.3d   at    35   (finding     no   abuse     of    discretion     in\n\nexclusion of hearsay statement absent any evidence that the person\n\nwho related the statement had authority to speak for the employer).\n\n              Alternatively, the appellant hawks the exception for\n\npresent sense impressions.            Under this exception, a statement is\n\nnot hearsay if it describes or explains an event and is made either\n\nwhile   the    declarant       is    perceiving     the   event       or   immediately\n\nthereafter, such that the contemporaneity of the event and the\n\nstatement negate the possibility of deliberate falsification.                        See\n\nFed. R. Evid. 803(1) & advisory committee's note.                      The appellant\n\nhas offered no facts regarding the temporal relationship between\n\nGonzález-Fonseca's alleged comment and the co-workers' revelations\n\nof what ostensibly was said.             The appellant's account of the co-\n\nworkers'      disclosures      is     thus   rank      hearsay     and,     as     such,\n\ninappropriate for consideration on summary judgment.                       See Lopez-\n\nRosario, 134 F.3d at 33.\n\n              That ends this aspect of the matter.               Without González-\n\nFonseca's supposed statement, there is nothing in the summary\n\njudgment record from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude\n\nthat the appellant was dismissed because of his age. Consequently,\n\nsummary judgment was appropriate in regard to the ADEA claim.\n\n              3.   Law 100.     The appellant's attempt to secure relief\n\nunder Law 100 need not detain us.              As said, Law 100 is the Puerto\n\nRico    anti-discrimination            statute.           As     applied      to     age\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fdiscrimination, it differs from the ADEA only with respect to how\n\nthe burden-shifting framework operates.4               See Cardona Jimenez v.\n\nBancomerico de P.R., 174 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n               We   need   not   wax   longiloquent.     On   the   merits,   age\n\ndiscrimination claims asserted under the ADEA and under Law 100 are\n\ncoterminous.        See Gonzalez v. El Dia 304 F.3d 63, 73 (1st Cir.\n\n2002).      That being so, it suffices to reiterate that the appellant\n\nadduced no significantly probative evidence that his discharge was\n\nmotivated by age.          Accordingly, the district court appropriately\n\nentered summary judgment for the Station on the Law 100 claim.                See\n\nid.\n\nIII.       CONCLUSION\n\n               We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe reject the instant appeal.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      Because the plaintiff has adduced absolutely no evidence that\nhis firing was predicated on age, the differences between how Law\n100 and the ADEA distribute the burdens of proof are immaterial to\nour analysis.    Thus, we need not discuss them here.      See Am.\nAirlines, Inc. v. Cardoza-Rodriguez, 133 F.3d 111, 125 (1st Cir.\n1998).\n\n                                        -19-\n\f",

Arroyo on brief for appellant.</p>\n<p>Juan M. Frontera-Suau on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Circuit Judge, SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge, and LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>In this age discrimination case, plaintiff-appellant Ernesto Dávila challenges the entry of summary judgment in favor of his former employer, defendant-appellee Corporación de Puerto Rico para la Difusión Pública (the Station). Discerning no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p>The critical facts are uncomplicated. The Station is Puerto Rico's public broadcasting outlet. On August 1, 2000, it hired the appellant as a temporary worker in its engineering department. One month later, the appellant received an appointment as chief engineer, subject, however, to an explicit 10-month probationary period. During that interval, the appellant was to be trained in the duties of the position and periodically evaluated.</p>\n<p>Evaluations were conducted on three occasions during the probationary period: in December 2000, March 2001, and May 2001. These reviews, composed by the Station's director of engineering, Jorge E. González-Fonseca, were generally unfavorable. According to González-Fonseca, the appellant lacked a working knowledge of the Station's equipment, neglected to complete his assigned tasks in a timely manner, and proved to be in constant need of instruction.</p>\n<p>Relying on these negative evaluations, the Station's president, Linda Hernández, chose not to extend a permanent appointment to the appellant and, instead, terminated his employment at the end of the probationary period.</p>\n<p>The appellant sued, asserting that the Station had discriminated against him because of his age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634, and Puerto Rico's anti-discrimination statute, P.R. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 146 (Law 100). He claimed in substance that he was terminated solely because González-Fonseca thought he was too old for the job. The Station denied the pivotal allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of discovery, the Station moved for summary judgment. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. The district court granted the motion over the appellant's objection, concluding that there was no probative evidence of discriminatory animus. <i>Dávila v. Corporación De P.R. Para La Difusión Pública,</i> Civ. No. 04-2002, 2006 WL 2092570 (D.P.R. July 26, 2006). As an alternative ground, the district court ruled that the Station was immune from the appellant's claims for damages. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. amend. XI. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p>We subdivide our analysis into several segments. First, we briefly limn the standard of review and, relatedly, the summary judgment standard. Next, we deal with an evidentiary question concerning certain untranslated Spanish-language documents. Third, we explain why we eschew any inquiry into the question of Eleventh Amendment immunity. When these preliminaries have been completed, we turn to the merits of the discrimination claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Standards.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's entry of summary judgment de novo. <i>See </i><i>Iverson v. City of Boston,</i> 452 F.3d 94, 98 (1st Cir.2006). Like the district court, we must take the facts of record in the light most flattering to the nonmovant (here, the appellant) and draw all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>The object of summary judgment is \"to pierce the boilerplate of the pleadings and assay the parties' proof in order to determine whether trial is actually required.\" <i>Acosta v. Ames Dep't Stores, Inc.,</i> 386 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Wynne v. Tufts Univ. Sch. of Med.,</i> 976 F.2d 791, 794 (1st Cir.1992)). Thus, summary judgment is appropriate only when the record \"show[s] that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p>For this purpose, an issue is genuine if \"a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of the nonmoving party.\" <i>Suárez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> 229 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir.2000). By like token, a fact is material if it has the potential to determine the outcome of the litigation. <i>See </i><i>Calvi v. Knox County,</i> 470 F.3d 422, 426 (1st Cir. 2006). Where, as here, the nonmovant has the burden of proof and the evidence on one or more of the critical issues in the case \"is . . . not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\" <i>Acosta,</i> 386 F.3d at 8 (quoting <i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 249-50, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Spanish-Language Documents.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We next address a threshold matter. In support of its motion for summary judgment, the Station submitted an array of papers. These included several Spanish-language documents unaccompanied by corresponding English translations. Submission of these documents contravened a local rule requiring all litigation papers to be submitted in English. <i>See</i> D.P.R.R. 10(b). The district court granted the Station leave to file these Spanish-language writings but ordered certified translations to be furnished within one month's time. The Station failed to comply.</p>\n<p>More than two months after ordering the filing of translations, the district court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> entered summary judgment for the Station. <i>Dávila,</i> 2006 WL 2092570, at *7. In its decision, the court did not allude to the missing translations. The appellant contends that the rendering of summary judgment with the untranslated documents in the record constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p>\"It is well settled that federal litigation in Puerto Rico [must] be conducted in English.\" <i>González-De-Blasini v. Family Dep't,</i> 377 F.3d 81, 88 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see</i> 48 U.S.C. § 864 (requiring that \"all pleadings and proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico . . . be conducted in the English language\"). When a district court accepts foreign-language documents without the required English translations, an appellate court cannot consider the untranslated documents on appeal. <i>See </i><i>Estades-Negroni v. Assocs. Corp. of N. Am.,</i> 359 F.3d 1, 2-3 (1st Cir.2004); Fed. R.App. P. 10. Where the record shows that English translations were used in the trial court but somehow were not put into the record as they should have been, the parties may invoke Fed. R.App. P. 10 to correct the record. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Vazquez Guadalupe,</i> 407 F.3d 492, 498 (1st Cir.2005). That is not the situation here. If the untranslated documents are or may be essential to the resolution of an issue raised on appeal, and are not subject to cure by means of Fed. R.App. P. 10, the lack of translation may undermine meaningful appellate review. <i>United States v. Rivera-Rosario,</i> 300 F.3d 1, 10 (1st Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p>The documents in question here, translations of which have been made available on appeal, consist of the appellant's performance evaluations, letters from the Station's president notifying him of his appointment and termination respectively, and excerpts from his deposition testimony. It is crystal clear that none of these documents bear on any of the issues that the court found dispositive in adjudicating the summary judgment motion. In any event, in addition to the untranslated documents, the Station submitted other documents with its motion for summary judgment. These included a sworn statement, in English, from Nancy Piñero, the director of the Station's legal division. In that statement, Piñero summarized the contents of the appellant's personnel file, including the three performance reviews. Whatever additional information might exist in the untranslated documents is wholly extraneous and, therefore, inconsequential to the district court's resolution of the matter. In short, the existence of the Piñero statement makes it readily evident that nothing contained in the documents had any bearing on the district court's <i>ratio decidendi.</i></p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. Because the untranslated documents had no potential to affect the disposition of the case at the summary judgment stage, we conclude that the mere presence of the untranslated documents in the district court record cannot support a claim of reversible error. <i>See </i><i>González-De-Blasini,</i> 377 F.3d at 89.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Eleventh Amendment Immunity.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court found, as an alternate ground of decision, that the Station enjoys Eleventh Amendment immunity. The appellant not only disputes that finding but also advances a claim of waiver.</p>\n<p>This contretemps might easily be mistaken as a threshold issue. After all, the Eleventh Amendment has been described as implicating subject-matter jurisdiction. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Wis. Dep't of Corr. v. Schacht,</i> 524 U.S. 381, 394, 118 S.Ct. 2047, 141 L.Ed.2d 364 (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring). This is potentially important <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> because, in many instances, colorable challenges to a court's subject-matter jurisdiction must be adjudicated prior to adjudicating the merits of a case. <i>See </i><i>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 93-95, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998).</p>\n<p>Here, however, controlling circuit precedent allows us to defer thorny Eleventh Amendment questions in cases in which it is perfectly clear that the state entity will prevail on the merits.<sup>[1]</sup><i>See </i><i>Parella v. Ret. Bd. of R.I. Employees' Ret. Sys.,</i> 173 F.3d 46, 53-57 (1st Cir.1999). This is such a case. Consequently, we avail ourselves of this bypass option and proceed directly to the merits of the appellant's claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>The Merits.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The appellant seeks to recover on three causes of action. First, he claims that the Station violated his procedural due process rights in failing to provide him with notice and a hearing prior to his discharge. Second, he claims that his ouster was predicated on age and, thus, violated the ADEA. Third, he recasts his federal age discrimination claim in the idiom of Law 100. We deal with each cause of action in turn.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Due Process.</i> The appellant asserts, for the first time on appeal, that the Station abridged his procedural due process rights by failing to grant him notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to cashiering him. Although he concedes that a probationary employee has no such rights, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Somers v. City of Minneapolis,</i> 245 F.3d 782, 785 (8th Cir.2001), he posits that he had moved from probationary status to career status before the ax fell.</p>\n<p>The appellant bases this proposition on a statute that provides in pertinent part that a probatory work contract \"in no case shall exceed three (3) months.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 185(h). The statute further declares that, \"should the employee continue to work for the employer after the term established in the probatory work contract, said employee shall acquire all the rights of an employee.\" <i>Id.</i> The appellant takes this to mean that the 10-month probationary period to which he subscribed was illegal and that he attained the status of a permanent employee after occupying the chief engineer position for three months and one day.</p>\n<p>This is an interesting argument, but it comes as an afterthought. The appellant did not present it to the district court. The argument is, therefore, forfeited.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Leahy,</i> 473 F.3d 401, 409-10 (1st Cir.2007). We review forfeited issues for plain error. <i>See id.</i> at 410. Plain error review is not appellant-friendly; we will resuscitate a forfeited argument only if the appellant demonstrates that \"(1) an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the [appellant's] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> of the judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). As we explain below, the appellant in this case cannot satisfy this exacting standard.</p>\n<p>The Station was created by statute as an independent public service corporation. <i>See</i> Public Broadcasting Corporation, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, §§ 501-513. Pursuant to this statutory scheme, the Station is authorized to \"adopt, amend and repeal regulations to govern its affairs and activities.\" <i>Id.</i> § 504(3). It is also authorized to \"appoint and contract . . . employees . . . in accordance with the personnel regulations that are promulgated.\" <i>Id.</i> § 504(11).</p>\n<p>Exercising these powers, the Station promulgated a comprehensive set of regulations. <i>See</i> P.R. Reg. No. 5468 (July 13, 1995). Pertinently, one of those regulations provides that the duration of a probationary work period for a Station recruit can be between three months and one year. <i>See id.</i> § 8.9(2).</p>\n<p>This regulation, which validates the 10-month probationary period contained in the appellant's contract, arguably conflicts with section 185(h) in that it purports to allow probationary periods longer than three months. The question, then, reduces to whether the Puerto Rico legislature intended the general statute  section 185(h)  to restrict the latitude that it gave to the Station in an entity-specific statute. There is no controlling case law to guide us on how to navigate our way through such a conflict. As a result, the answer to the nuanced question that the appellant's argument poses is not immediately obvious.</p>\n<p>That is game, set, and match. The lack of any clear, easily determinable answer to a legal conundrum is, in itself, enough to defeat a claim of plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cordoza-Estrada,</i> 385 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2004). Accordingly, we reject the appellant's procedural due process claim.</p>\n<p>2. <i>ADEA.</i> The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer to \"discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual . . . because of such individual's age.\" 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1); <i>see </i><i>Suárez,</i> 229 F.3d at 53. The appellant alleges that his discharge transgressed this proscription.</p>\n<p>When an employee claims to have been discharged in violation of the ADEA, he must shoulder the ultimate \"burden of proving that his years were the determinative factor in his discharge, that is, that he would not have been fired but for his age.\" <i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 950 F.2d 816, 823 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting <i>Freeman v. Package Mach. Co.,</i> 865 F.2d 1331, 1335 (1st Cir.1988)). The Supreme Court has developed a burden-shifting framework to facilitate the process of proving discrimination in the absence of direct evidence. <i>See </i><i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> 411 U.S. 792, 802-05, 93 S.Ct. 1817, 36 L.Ed.2d 668 (1973), <i>see also </i><i>Sanchez v. P.R. Oil Co.,</i> 37 F.3d 712, 718-20 (1st Cir.1994) (applying that framework in an ADEA case).</p>\n<p>The initial burden lies with the plaintiff to demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Velázquez-Fernández v. NCE Foods, Inc.,</i> 476 F.3d 6, 11 (1st Cir.2007). To satisfy this burden, the plaintiff must produce evidence showing four facts: (i) that he was at least forty years old when shown the door; (ii) that his job performance met or exceeded the employer's legitimate expectations; (iii) that his employer actually or constructively discharged him; and (iv) that his employer had a continuing need for the services he formerly furnished. <i>See id.</i>; <i>Suárez,</i> 229 F.3d at 53.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> Here, the first, third, and fourth prongs of the appellant's prima facie case are not in dispute. The Station acknowledges that the appellant was in the protected age group on May 31, 2000; it admits that it terminated his employment on that date; and it concedes that it hired a replacement upon the appellant's departure. There is a substantial question as to whether the appellant has satisfied the second element but we assume for the sake of argument that he has made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p>Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, a presumption of discrimination arises and the burden of production shifts to the employer to proffer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge. <i>See </i><i>Rivera-Aponte v. Rest. Metro. # 3, Inc.,</i> 338 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir.2003). The employer's burden is not a burden of persuasion; the employer need do no more than articulate a reason which, on its face, would justify a conclusion that the plaintiff was let go for a nondiscriminatory motive. <i>See </i><i>Sanchez,</i> 37 F.3d at 720; <i>Mesnick,</i> 950 F.2d at 823.</p>\n<p>In this instance, the Station asserted, through the sworn statement of Piñero, that the appellant was terminated because of poor work performance during his probationary stint. This statement, by itself, provides sufficient basis for the district court's conclusion that the Station articulated a nondisciminatory motive for the appellant's discharge. <i>See </i><i>Douglas v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc.,</i> 474 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp.,</i> 51 F.3d 1087, 1092 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>When, as in this case, the employer produces a facially adequate explanation for the discharge, the presumption of discrimination created by the plaintiff's prima facie case disappears from view. <i>See </i><i>Ramírez Rodríguez v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharm., Inc.,</i> 425 F.3d 67, 78 (1st Cir. 2005). At that juncture, the burden reverts to the plaintiff, who must show that the \"reason given by the employer for the discharge is pretextual, and, moreover, that it is pretext for age discrimination.\" <i>Sanchez,</i> 37 F.3d at 720. In other words, the bottom-line question of discrimination vel non comes front and center. <i>See </i><i>Ramírez Rodríguez,</i> 425 F.3d at 78; <i>Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt &amp; Colman, Inc.,</i> 277 F.3d 40, 45 (1st Cir.2002). At summary judgment, this question reduces to whether or not the plaintiff has adduced minimally sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that he was fired because of his age. <i>See </i><i>Ramírez Rodríguez,</i> 425 F.3d at 78; <i>Zapata-Matos,</i> 277 F.3d at 45.</p>\n<p>Here, the appellant endeavors to carry this burden by showing that the Station's proffered reason was a pretext and that he was actually cashiered because of his age. His efforts take two forms. First, he tries to discredit his negative performance evaluations. Second, he cites office gossip as a basis for concluding that the Station wanted to get rid of him because of his age. Neither offering bears fruit.</p>\n<p>The appellant's claim that his work performance was unfairly evaluated rests on three supporting allegations: that he was not given adequate training; that the reviews were an inaccurate reflection of his performance; and that González-Fonseca was unqualified to compile the reviews because he did not hold an engineering license. This is whistling past the graveyard. These allegations, even if true, would indicate no more than that the appellant's dismissal was unfair or unwise; they would not indicate age discrimination. We explain briefly.</p>\n<p>When assessing a claim of pretext in an employment discrimination case, a court's focus is necessarily on the motivations and perceptions of the decisionmaker. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> <i>Mesnick,</i> 950 F.2d at 824. Thus, as long as the Station believed that the appellant's performance was not up to snuff  and the appellant has presented no evidence suggesting that management thought otherwise  it is not our province to second-guess a decision to fire him as a poor performer.<sup>[3]</sup> That is true regardless of whether, to an objective observer, the decision would seem wise or foolish, correct or incorrect, sound or arbitrary. <i>See </i><i>Velázquez-Fernández,</i> 476 F.3d at 12; <i>see also </i><i>Mesnick,</i> 950 F.2d at 825 (explaining that \"courts may not sit as super personnel departments, assessing the merits . . . of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions\"). For a quondam employee to withstand summary judgment in an age discrimination case, there must be some significantly probative evidence from which the factfinder can infer that the employer discharged the employee because of his age. <i>See </i><i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,</i> 530 U.S. 133, 146-47, 120 S.Ct. 2097, 147 L.Ed.2d 105 (2000). Proof of pretext may give rise to such an inference; proof of a mistaken judgment does not.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the appellant's other evidence of age discrimination: his own affidavit, in which he asserted that several unidentified co-workers had told him that González-Fonseca believed that he (the appellant) \"was too old to hold the position of Chief Engineer.\"</p>\n<p>The district court refused to give weight to this statement, and so do we. The appellant offered the statement to prove the truth of the matter asserted; that is, that González-Fonseca believed the appellant was too old for the job. But the appellant had no personal knowledge of any conversations between González-Fonseca and his co-workers, and none of the co-workers signed an affidavit or gave a deposition in which the contents of any such conversations were disclosed. Consequently, the statement was hearsay. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). It is black-letter law that hearsay evidence cannot be considered on summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Vazquez v. Lopez-Rosario,</i> 134 F.3d 28, 33 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> 895 F.2d 46, 49 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e).</p>\n<p>In an effort to salvage this evidence, the appellant labors to persuade us that the crucial statement is excluded from the operation of the hearsay rule by either the exception for party-opponent admissions or the exception for present sense impressions. We are not convinced.</p>\n<p>For a statement to qualify as an admission by a party-opponent, the statement must be made by a party, a person authorized by the party to make statements on its behalf concerning the subject, or the party's agent or servant acting within the scope of his or her agency or employment. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2); <i>see also </i><i>McDonough v. City of Quincy,</i> 452 F.3d 8, 21 (1st Cir.2006). While González-Fonseca would fit within this taxonomy, he did not make the statement in question to the appellant; rather, he is alleged to have made it to some unidentified co-workers. Thus, unless these co-workers were of sufficient stature to bind the Station, the statement is clearly inadmissible as a mere third-party account of what González-Fonseca is alleged to have said.</p>\n<p>The appellant cannot clear this hurdle. He did not identify his sources and, without that information, there is no reliable way to tell whether they fit within any of the Rule 801(d)(2) categories. Therefore, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> the statement was not admissible on this basis. <i>See </i><i>Orta-Castro v. Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme Química P.R., Inc.,</i> 447 F.3d 105, 114 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also </i><i>Lopez-Rosario,</i> 134 F.3d at 35 (finding no abuse of discretion in exclusion of hearsay statement absent any evidence that the person who related the statement had authority to speak for the employer).</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the appellant hawks the exception for present sense impressions. Under this exception, a statement is not hearsay if it describes or explains an event and is made either while the declarant is perceiving the event or immediately thereafter, such that the contemporaneity of the event and the statement negate the possibility of deliberate falsification. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 803(1) &amp; advisory committee's note. The appellant has offered no facts regarding the temporal relationship between González-Fonseca's alleged comment and the co-workers' revelations of what ostensibly was said. The appellant's account of the co-workers' disclosures is thus rank hearsay and, as such, inappropriate for consideration on summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Lopez-Rosario,</i> 134 F.3d at 33.</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. Without González-Fonseca's supposed statement, there is nothing in the summary judgment record from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the appellant was dismissed because of his age. Consequently, summary judgment was appropriate in regard to the ADEA claim.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Law 100.</i> The appellant's attempt to secure relief under Law 100 need not detain us. As said, Law 100 is the Puerto Rico anti-discrimination statute. As applied to age discrimination, it differs from the ADEA only with respect to how the burden-shifting framework operates.<sup>[4]</sup><i>See </i><i>Cardona Jimenez v. Bancomerico de P.R.,</i> 174 F.3d 36, 42 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>We need not wax longiloquent. On the merits, age discrimination claims asserted under the ADEA and under Law 100 are coterminous. <i>See </i><i>Gonzalez v. El Dia</i> 304 F.3d 63, 73 (1st Cir.2002). That being so, it suffices to reiterate that the appellant adduced no significantly probative evidence that his discharge was motivated by age. Accordingly, the district court appropriately entered summary judgment for the Station on the Law 100 claim. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we reject the instant appeal.</p>\n<p>Affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For purposes of the Eleventh Amendment, Puerto Rico is the functional equivalent of a state. <i>See </i><i>Espinal-Dominguez v. Puerto Rico,</i> 352 F.3d 490, 494 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>[2]  The Station argues that the appellant waived this argument by not raising it before the district court. We do not agree. A party waives a right only if he intentionally relinquishes or abandons it; he forfeits a right by failing to assert it in a timely manner. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 733, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <i>United States v. Rodriguez,</i> 311 F.3d 435, 437 (1st Cir.2002). Because the argument in question was not identified in any form or fashion below, the appellant could not be said, on this record, to have intentionally abandoned it.</p>\n<p>[3]  There is no evidence that management relied on biased information from an employee who demonstrably possessed a discriminatory animus. <i>See </i><i>Cariglia v. Hertz Equip. Rental Corp.</i> 363 F.3d 77, 85-88 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>[4]  Because the plaintiff has adduced absolutely no evidence that his firing was predicated on age, the differences between how Law 100 and the ADEA distribute the burdens of proof are immaterial to our analysis. Thus, we need not discuss them here. <i>See </i><i>Am. Airlines, Inc. v. Cardoza-Rodriguez,</i> 133 F.3d 111, 125 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n\n</div>",

Frontera-Suau on brief for appellee.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Circuit Judge, SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge, and LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>In this age discrimination case, plaintiff-appellant Ernesto Dávila challenges the entry of summary judgment in favor of his former employer, defendant-appellee Corporación de Puerto Rico para la Difusión Pública (the Station). Discerning no reversible error, we affirm.</p>\n<p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n<p>The critical facts are uncomplicated. The Station is Puerto Rico's public broadcasting outlet. On August 1, 2000, it hired the appellant as a temporary worker in its engineering department. One month later, the appellant received an appointment as chief engineer, subject, however, to an explicit 10-month probationary period. During that interval, the appellant was to be trained in the duties of the position and periodically evaluated.</p>\n<p>Evaluations were conducted on three occasions during the probationary period: in December 2000, March 2001, and May 2001. These reviews, composed by the Station's director of engineering, Jorge E. González-Fonseca, were generally unfavorable. According to González-Fonseca, the appellant lacked a working knowledge of the Station's equipment, neglected to complete his assigned tasks in a timely manner, and proved to be in constant need of instruction.</p>\n<p>Relying on these negative evaluations, the Station's president, Linda Hernández, chose not to extend a permanent appointment to the appellant and, instead, terminated his employment at the end of the probationary period.</p>\n<p>The appellant sued, asserting that the Station had discriminated against him because of his age in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), 29 U.S.C. §§ 621-634, and Puerto Rico's anti-discrimination statute, P.R. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 146 (Law 100). He claimed in substance that he was terminated solely because González-Fonseca thought he was too old for the job. The Station denied the pivotal allegations of the complaint.</p>\n<p>At the conclusion of discovery, the Station moved for summary judgment. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. The district court granted the motion over the appellant's objection, concluding that there was no probative evidence of discriminatory animus. <i>Dávila v. Corporación De P.R. Para La Difusión Pública,</i> Civ. No. 04-2002, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2092570</span></span> (D.P.R. July 26, 2006). As an alternative ground, the district court ruled that the Station was immune from the appellant's claims for damages. <i>See</i> U.S. Const. amend. XI. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n<p>II. DISCUSSION</p>\n<p>We subdivide our analysis into several segments. First, we briefly limn the standard of review and, relatedly, the summary judgment standard. Next, we deal with an evidentiary question concerning certain untranslated Spanish-language documents. Third, we explain why we eschew any inquiry into the question of Eleventh Amendment immunity. When these preliminaries have been completed, we turn to the merits of the discrimination claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Standards.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review a district court's entry of summary judgment de novo. <i>See </i><i>Iverson v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202298\"><a href=\"/opinion/202298/iverson-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span>, 98 (1st Cir.2006). Like the district court, we must take the facts of record in the light most flattering to the nonmovant (here, the appellant) and draw all reasonable inferences in that party's favor. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>The object of summary judgment is \"to pierce the boilerplate of the pleadings and assay the parties' proof in order to determine whether trial is actually required.\" <i>Acosta v. Ames Dep't Stores, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201253\"><a href=\"/opinion/201253/acosta-v-ames-dept-store/\"><span class=\"volume\">386</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2004) (quoting <i>Wynne v. Tufts Univ. Sch. of Med.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"592073\"><a href=\"/opinion/592073/steven-wynne-v-tufts-university-school-of-medicine/\"><span class=\"volume\">976</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">791</span></a></span>, 794 (1st Cir.1992)). Thus, summary judgment is appropriate only when the record \"show[s] that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n<p>For this purpose, an issue is genuine if \"a reasonable jury could resolve the point in favor of the nonmoving party.\" <i>Suárez v. Pueblo Int'l, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770706\"><a href=\"/opinion/770706/ramon-m-suarez-v-pueblo-international-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">229</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.2000). By like token, a fact is material if it has the potential to determine the outcome of the litigation. <i>See </i><i>Calvi v. Knox County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202546\"><a href=\"/opinion/202546/calvi-v-knox-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">470</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">422</span></a></span>, 426 (1st Cir. 2006). Where, as here, the nonmovant has the burden of proof and the evidence on one or more of the critical issues in the case \"is . . . not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.\" <i>Acosta,</i> 386 F.3d at 8 (quoting <i>Anderson v.

In support of its motion for summary judgment, the Station submitted an array of papers. These included several Spanish-language documents unaccompanied by corresponding English translations. Submission of these documents contravened a local rule requiring all litigation papers to be submitted in English. <i>See</i> D.P.R.R. 10(b). The district court granted the Station leave to file these Spanish-language writings but ordered certified translations to be furnished within one month's time. The Station failed to comply.</p>\n<p>More than two months after ordering the filing of translations, the district court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> entered summary judgment for the Station. <i>Dávila,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2006</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">2092570</span></span>, at *7. In its decision, the court did not allude to the missing translations. The appellant contends that the rendering of summary judgment with the untranslated documents in the record constituted reversible error.</p>\n<p>\"It is well settled that federal litigation in Puerto Rico [must] be conducted in English.\" <i>González-De-Blasini v. Family Dep't,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201167\"><a href=\"/opinion/201167/gonzalez-de-blasini-v-family-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 88 (1st Cir. 2004) (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>see</i> 48 U.S.C. § 864 (requiring that \"all pleadings and proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico . . . be conducted in the English language\"). When a district court accepts foreign-language documents without the required English translations, an appellate court cannot consider the untranslated documents on appeal. <i>See </i><i>Estades-Negroni v. Assocs. Corp. of N. Am.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785190\"><a href=\"/opinion/785190/nydia-estades-negroni-v-the-associates-corporation-of-north-america/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 2-3 (1st Cir.2004); Fed. R.App. P. 10. Where the record shows that English translations were used in the trial court but somehow were not put into the record as they should have been, the parties may invoke Fed. R.App. P. 10 to correct the record. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Vazquez Guadalupe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201586\"><a href=\"/opinion/201586/united-states-v-vazquez-guadalupe/\"><span class=\"volume\">407</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">492</span></a></span>, 498 (1st Cir.2005). That is not the situation here. If the untranslated documents are or may be essential to the resolution of an issue raised on appeal, and are not subject to cure by means of Fed. R.App. P. 10, the lack of translation may undermine meaningful appellate review. <i>United States v. Rivera-Rosario,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">300</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 10 (1st Cir. 2002).</p>\n<p>The documents in question here, translations of which have been made available on appeal, consist of the appellant's performance evaluations, letters from the Station's president notifying him of his appointment and termination respectively, and excerpts from his deposition testimony. It is crystal clear that none of these documents bear on any of the issues that the court found dispositive in adjudicating the summary judgment motion. In any event, in addition to the untranslated documents, the Station submitted other documents with its motion for summary judgment. These included a sworn statement, in English, from Nancy Piñero, the director of the Station's legal division. In that statement, Piñero summarized the contents of the appellant's personnel file, including the three performance reviews. Whatever additional information might exist in the untranslated documents is wholly extraneous and, therefore, inconsequential to the district court's resolution of the matter. In short, the existence of the Piñero statement makes it readily evident that nothing contained in the documents had any bearing on the district court's <i>ratio decidendi.</i></p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. Because the untranslated documents had no potential to affect the disposition of the case at the summary judgment stage, we conclude that the mere presence of the untranslated documents in the district court record cannot support a claim of reversible error. <i>See </i><i>González-De-Blasini,</i> 377 F.3d at 89.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Eleventh Amendment Immunity.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court found, as an alternate ground of decision, that the Station enjoys Eleventh Amendment immunity. The appellant not only disputes that finding but also advances a claim of waiver.</p>\n<p>This contretemps might easily be mistaken as a threshold issue. After all, the Eleventh Amendment has been described as implicating subject-matter jurisdiction. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Wis. Dep't of Corr. v. Schacht,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118236\"><a href=\"/opinion/118236/wisconsin-dept-of-corrections-v-schacht/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">381</span></a></span>, 394, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118236\"><a href=\"/opinion/118236/wisconsin-dept-of-corrections-v-schacht/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">364</span></a></span> (1998) (Kennedy, J., concurring). This is potentially important <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> because, in many instances, colorable challenges to a court's subject-matter jurisdiction must be adjudicated prior to adjudicating the merits of a case. <i>See </i><i>Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env't,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620886\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620886/steel-co-v-citizens-for-better-environment/\"><span class=\"volume\">523</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 93-95, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2620886\"><a href=\"/opinion/2620886/steel-co-v-citizens-for-better-environment/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">210</span></a></span> (1998).</p>\n<p>Here, however, controlling circuit precedent allows us to defer thorny Eleventh Amendment questions in cases in which it is perfectly clear that the state entity will prevail on the merits.<sup>[1]</sup><i>See </i><i>Parella v. Ret. Bd. of R.I. Employees' Ret. Sys.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198432\"><a href=\"/opinion/198432/parella-v-retirement/\"><span class=\"volume\">173</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 53-57 (1st Cir.1999). This is such a case. Consequently, we avail ourselves of this bypass option and proceed directly to the merits of the appellant's claims.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>The Merits.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The appellant seeks to recover on three causes of action. First, he claims that the Station violated his procedural due process rights in failing to provide him with notice and a hearing prior to his discharge. Second, he claims that his ouster was predicated on age and, thus, violated the ADEA. Third, he recasts his federal age discrimination claim in the idiom of Law 100. We deal with each cause of action in turn.</p>\n<p>1. <i>Due Process.</i> The appellant asserts, for the first time on appeal, that the Station abridged his procedural due process rights by failing to grant him notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to cashiering him. Although he concedes that a probationary employee has no such rights, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Somers v. City of Minneapolis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772730\"><a href=\"/opinion/772730/david-somers-v-city-of-minneapolis/\"><span class=\"volume\">245</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">782</span></a></span>, 785 (8th Cir.2001), he posits that he had moved from probationary status to career status before the ax fell.</p>\n<p>The appellant bases this proposition on a statute that provides in pertinent part that a probatory work contract \"in no case shall exceed three (3) months.\" P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 29, § 185(h). The statute further declares that, \"should the employee continue to work for the employer after the term established in the probatory work contract, said employee shall acquire all the rights of an employee.\" <i>Id.</i> The appellant takes this to mean that the 10-month probationary period to which he subscribed was illegal and that he attained the status of a permanent employee after occupying the chief engineer position for three months and one day.</p>\n<p>This is an interesting argument, but it comes as an afterthought. The appellant did not present it to the district court. The argument is, therefore, forfeited.<sup>[2]</sup><i>See </i><i>United States v. Leahy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202599\"><a href=\"/opinion/202599/united-states-v-leahy/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">401</span></a></span>, 409-10 (1st Cir.2007). We review forfeited issues for plain error. <i>See id.</i> at 410. Plain error review is not appellant-friendly; we will resuscitate a forfeited argument only if the appellant demonstrates that \"(1) an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the [appellant's] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation <span class=\"star-pagination\">*15</span> of the judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001). As we explain below, the appellant in this case cannot satisfy this exacting standard.</p>\n<p>The Station was created by statute as an independent public service corporation. <i>See</i> Public Broadcasting Corporation, P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 27, §§ 501-513. Pursuant to this statutory scheme, the Station is authorized to \"adopt, amend and repeal regulations to govern its affairs and activities.\" <i>Id.</i> § 504(3). It is also authorized to \"appoint and contract . . . employees . . . in accordance with the personnel regulations that are promulgated.\" <i>Id.</i> § 504(11).</p>\n<p>Exercising these powers, the Station promulgated a comprehensive set of regulations. <i>See</i> P.R. Reg. No. 5468 (July 13, 1995). Pertinently, one of those regulations provides that the duration of a probationary work period for a Station recruit can be between three months and one year. <i>See id.</i> § 8.9(2).</p>\n<p>This regulation, which validates the 10-month probationary period contained in the appellant's contract, arguably conflicts with section 185(h) in that it purports to allow probationary periods longer than three months. The question, then, reduces to whether the Puerto Rico legislature intended the general statute  section 185(h)  to restrict the latitude that it gave to the Station in an entity-specific statute. There is no controlling case law to guide us on how to navigate our way through such a conflict. As a result, the answer to the nuanced question that the appellant's argument poses is not immediately obvious.</p>\n<p>That is game, set, and match. The lack of any clear, easily determinable answer to a legal conundrum is, in itself, enough to defeat a claim of plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Cordoza-Estrada,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201261\"><a href=\"/opinion/201261/united-states-v-cordoza-estrada/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2004). Accordingly, we reject the appellant's procedural due process claim.</p>\n<p>2. <i>ADEA.</i> The ADEA makes it unlawful for an employer to \"discharge any individual or otherwise discriminate against any individual . . . because of such individual's age.\" 29 U.S.C. § 623(a)(1); <i>see </i><i>Suárez,</i> 229 F.3d at 53. The appellant alleges that his discharge transgressed this proscription.</p>\n<p>When an employee claims to have been discharged in violation of the ADEA, he must shoulder the ultimate \"burden of proving that his years were the determinative factor in his discharge, that is, that he would not have been fired but for his age.\" <i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 823 (1st Cir.1991) (quoting <i>Freeman v. Package Mach.

The Supreme Court has developed a burden-shifting framework to facilitate the process of proving discrimination in the absence of direct evidence. <i>See </i><i>McDonnell Douglas Corp. v. Green,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">411</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">792</span></a></span>, 802-05, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1817</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108786\"><a href=\"/opinion/108786/mcdonnell-douglas-corp-v-green/\"><span class=\"volume\">36</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span> (1973), <i>see also </i><i>Sanchez v. P.R. Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"679955\"><a href=\"/opinion/679955/jose-l-sanchez-v-puerto-rico-oil-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">37</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">712</span></a></span>, 718-20 (1st Cir.1994) (applying that framework in an ADEA case).</p>\n<p>The initial burden lies with the plaintiff to demonstrate a prima facie case of discrimination. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Velázquez-Fernández v. NCE Foods, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202607\"><a href=\"/opinion/202607/velazquez-fernandez-v-nce-food-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">476</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">6</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.2007). To satisfy this burden, the plaintiff must produce evidence showing four facts: (i) that he was at least forty years old when shown the door; (ii) that his job performance met or exceeded the employer's legitimate expectations; (iii) that his employer actually or constructively discharged him; and (iv) that his employer had a continuing need for the services he formerly furnished. <i>See id.</i>; <i>Suárez,</i> 229 F.3d at 53.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*16</span> Here, the first, third, and fourth prongs of the appellant's prima facie case are not in dispute. The Station acknowledges that the appellant was in the protected age group on May 31, 2000; it admits that it terminated his employment on that date; and it concedes that it hired a replacement upon the appellant's departure. There is a substantial question as to whether the appellant has satisfied the second element but we assume for the sake of argument that he has made the requisite showing.</p>\n<p>Once a plaintiff establishes a prima facie case, a presumption of discrimination arises and the burden of production shifts to the employer to proffer a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge. <i>See </i><i>Rivera-Aponte v. Rest. Metro. # 3, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782932\"><a href=\"/opinion/782932/raul-rivera-aponte-v-restaurant-metropol-3-inc-dba-restaurant-metropol/\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.2003). The employer's burden is not a burden of persuasion; the employer need do no more than articulate a reason which, on its face, would justify a conclusion that the plaintiff was let go for a nondiscriminatory motive. <i>See </i><i>Sanchez,</i> 37 F.3d at 720; <i>Mesnick,</i> 950 F.2d at 823.</p>\n<p>In this instance, the Station asserted, through the sworn statement of Piñero, that the appellant was terminated because of poor work performance during his probationary stint. This statement, by itself, provides sufficient basis for the district court's conclusion that the Station articulated a nondisciminatory motive for the appellant's discharge. <i>See </i><i>Douglas v. J.C. Penney Co., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202597\"><a href=\"/opinion/202597/douglas-v-jc-penney-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">474</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Woodman v. Haemonetics Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196019\"><a href=\"/opinion/196019/woodman-v-heamonetics-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">51</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1087</span></a></span>, 1092 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n<p>When, as in this case, the employer produces a facially adequate explanation for the discharge, the presumption of discrimination created by the plaintiff's prima facie case disappears from view. <i>See </i><i>Ramírez Rodríguez v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharm., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201844\"><a href=\"/opinion/201844/ramirez-rodriguez-v-boehringer/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 78 (1st Cir. 2005). At that juncture, the burden reverts to the plaintiff, who must show that the \"reason given by the employer for the discharge is pretextual, and, moreover, that it is pretext for age discrimination.\" <i>Sanchez,</i> 37 F.3d at 720. In other words, the bottom-line question of discrimination vel non comes front and center. <i>See </i><i>Ramírez Rodríguez,</i> 425 F.3d at 78; <i>Zapata-Matos v. Reckitt &amp; Colman, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776184\"><a href=\"/opinion/776184/ram-n-zapata-matos-v-reckitt-colman-inc-fka-lf-products/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 45 (1st Cir.2002). At summary judgment, this question reduces to whether or not the plaintiff has adduced minimally sufficient evidence to permit a reasonable factfinder to conclude that he was fired because of his age. <i>See </i><i>Ramírez Rodríguez,</i> 425 F.3d at 78; <i>Zapata-Matos,</i> 277 F.3d at 45.</p>\n<p>Here, the appellant endeavors to carry this burden by showing that the Station's proffered reason was a pretext and that he was actually cashiered because of his age. His efforts take two forms. First, he tries to discredit his negative performance evaluations. Second, he cites office gossip as a basis for concluding that the Station wanted to get rid of him because of his age. Neither offering bears fruit.</p>\n<p>The appellant's claim that his work performance was unfairly evaluated rests on three supporting allegations: that he was not given adequate training; that the reviews were an inaccurate reflection of his performance; and that González-Fonseca was unqualified to compile the reviews because he did not hold an engineering license. This is whistling past the graveyard. These allegations, even if true, would indicate no more than that the appellant's dismissal was unfair or unwise; they would not indicate age discrimination. We explain briefly.</p>\n<p>When assessing a claim of pretext in an employment discrimination case, a court's focus is necessarily on the motivations and perceptions of the decisionmaker. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*17</span> <i>Mesnick,</i> 950 F.2d at 824. Thus, as long as the Station believed that the appellant's performance was not up to snuff  and the appellant has presented no evidence suggesting that management thought otherwise  it is not our province to second-guess a decision to fire him as a poor performer.<sup>[3]</sup> That is true regardless of whether, to an objective observer, the decision would seem wise or foolish, correct or incorrect, sound or arbitrary. <i>See </i><i>Velázquez-Fernández,</i> 476 F.3d at 12; <i>see also </i><i>Mesnick,</i> 950 F.2d at 825 (explaining that \"courts may not sit as super personnel departments, assessing the merits . . . of employers' nondiscriminatory business decisions\"). For a quondam employee to withstand summary judgment in an age discrimination case, there must be some significantly probative evidence from which the factfinder can infer that the employer discharged the employee because of his age. <i>See </i><i>Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">133</span></a></span>, 146-47, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2097</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1087667\"><a href=\"/opinion/1087667/reeves-v-sanderson-plumbing-products-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">147</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span> (2000). Proof of pretext may give rise to such an inference; proof of a mistaken judgment does not.</p>\n<p>This brings us to the appellant's other evidence of age discrimination: his own affidavit, in which he asserted that several unidentified co-workers had told him that González-Fonseca believed that he (the appellant) \"was too old to hold the position of Chief Engineer.\"</p>\n<p>The district court refused to give weight to this statement, and so do we. The appellant offered the statement to prove the truth of the matter asserted; that is, that González-Fonseca believed the appellant was too old for the job. But the appellant had no personal knowledge of any conversations between González-Fonseca and his co-workers, and none of the co-workers signed an affidavit or gave a deposition in which the contents of any such conversations were disclosed. Consequently, the statement was hearsay. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801(c). It is black-letter law that hearsay evidence cannot be considered on summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Vazquez v. Lopez-Rosario,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"750689\"><a href=\"/opinion/750689/waldo-g-vazquez-v-carlos-lopez-rosario/\"><span class=\"volume\">134</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">28</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Garside v. Osco Drug, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536033\"><a href=\"/opinion/536033/milissa-garside-v-osco-drug-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(e).</p>\n<p>In an effort to salvage this evidence, the appellant labors to persuade us that the crucial statement is excluded from the operation of the hearsay rule by either the exception for party-opponent admissions or the exception for present sense impressions. We are not convinced.</p>\n<p>For a statement to qualify as an admission by a party-opponent, the statement must be made by a party, a person authorized by the party to make statements on its behalf concerning the subject, or the party's agent or servant acting within the scope of his or her agency or employment. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2); <i>see also </i><i>McDonough v. City of Quincy,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202275\"><a href=\"/opinion/202275/mcdonough-v-city-of-quincy/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">8</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.2006). While González-Fonseca would fit within this taxonomy, he did not make the statement in question to the appellant; rather, he is alleged to have made it to some unidentified co-workers. Thus, unless these co-workers were of sufficient stature to bind the Station, the statement is clearly inadmissible as a mere third-party account of what González-Fonseca is alleged to have said.</p>\n<p>The appellant cannot clear this hurdle. He did not identify his sources and, without that information, there is no reliable way to tell whether they fit within any of the Rule 801(d)(2) categories. Therefore, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*18</span> the statement was not admissible on this basis. <i>See </i><i>Orta-Castro v. Merck, Sharp &amp; Dohme Química P.R., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202204\"><a href=\"/opinion/202204/orta-castro-v-merck-sharp-dohme/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">105</span></a></span>, 114 (1st Cir.2006); <i>see also </i><i>Lopez-Rosario,</i> 134 F.3d at 35 (finding no abuse of discretion in exclusion of hearsay statement absent any evidence that the person who related the statement had authority to speak for the employer).</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the appellant hawks the exception for present sense impressions. Under this exception, a statement is not hearsay if it describes or explains an event and is made either while the declarant is perceiving the event or immediately thereafter, such that the contemporaneity of the event and the statement negate the possibility of deliberate falsification. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Evid. 803(1) &amp; advisory committee's note. The appellant has offered no facts regarding the temporal relationship between González-Fonseca's alleged comment and the co-workers' revelations of what ostensibly was said. The appellant's account of the co-workers' disclosures is thus rank hearsay and, as such, inappropriate for consideration on summary judgment. <i>See </i><i>Lopez-Rosario,</i> 134 F.3d at 33.</p>\n<p>That ends this aspect of the matter. Without González-Fonseca's supposed statement, there is nothing in the summary judgment record from which a reasonable factfinder could conclude that the appellant was dismissed because of his age. Consequently, summary judgment was appropriate in regard to the ADEA claim.</p>\n<p>3. <i>Law 100.</i> The appellant's attempt to secure relief under Law 100 need not detain us. As said, Law 100 is the Puerto Rico anti-discrimination statute. As applied to age discrimination, it differs from the ADEA only with respect to how the burden-shifting framework operates.<sup>[4]</sup><i>See </i><i>Cardona Jimenez v. Bancomerico de P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763316\"><a href=\"/opinion/763316/79-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1358-75-empl-prac-dec-p-45845-rosa/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>We need not wax longiloquent. On the merits, age discrimination claims asserted under the ADEA and under Law 100 are coterminous. <i>See </i><i>Gonzalez v. El Dia</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200115\"><a href=\"/opinion/200115/gonzalez-v-el-dia-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">304</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 73 (1st Cir.2002). That being so, it suffices to reiterate that the appellant adduced no significantly probative evidence that his discharge was motivated by age. Accordingly, the district court appropriately entered summary judgment for the Station on the Law 100 claim. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>III. CONCLUSION</p>\n<p>We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we reject the instant appeal.</p>\n<p>Affirmed.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For purposes of the Eleventh Amendment, Puerto Rico is the functional equivalent of a state. <i>See </i><i>Espinal-Dominguez v. Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200783\"><a href=\"/opinion/200783/espinal-dominguez-v-commonwealth-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">352</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">490</span></a></span>, 494 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n<p>[2]  The Station argues that the appellant waived this argument by not raising it before the district court. We do not agree. A party waives a right only if he intentionally relinquishes or abandons it; he forfeits a right by failing to assert it in a timely manner. <i>See </i><i>United States v.

Because the argument in question was not identified in any form or fashion below, the appellant could not be said, on this record, to have intentionally abandoned it.</p>\n<p>[3]  There is no evidence that management relied on biased information from an employee who demonstrably possessed a discriminatory animus. <i>See </i><i>Cariglia v.
