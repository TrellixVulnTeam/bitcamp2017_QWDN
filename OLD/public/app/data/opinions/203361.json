See First Circuit\n\nInternal Operating Procedure X(C). In light of the Supreme Court's\n\ndecision in MetLife v. Glenn, No. 06-923 (June 19, 2008), the\n\npetition for panel rehearing is granted, and the petition for\n\nrehearing en banc is dismissed as moot, without prejudice to\n\nrefiling after the panel's further decision on rehearing.      The\n\fcourt's opinions issued March 28, 2007 are withdrawn, and the\n\njudgment entered March 28, 2007 is vacated.\n\n     The parties are directed to rebrief the appeal in light of\n\nMetLife.    The new set of briefs shall conform with all applicable\n\nfederal and local rules.        It is unnecessary to file a new set of\n\nappendices; thus, all citations in the briefs shall be to the\n\nexisting appendices.        Appellant must serve and file her brief\n\nwithin 40 days from entry of this order.          Appellees must serve and\n\nfile their brief within 30 days after the appellant's brief is\n\nserved.     Any reply brief must be served and filed within 14 days\n\nafter service of the appellees' brief.          Existing amici are invited\n\nto submit new amicus briefs, no later than 7 days after the\n\nprincipal    brief   of   the   party   being   supported   is   filed.    In\n\naddition, the court will entertain motions for leave to file amicus\n\nbriefs by new potential amici.          Such motions must comply with the\n\ntimetable and procedural requirements of Fed. R. App. P. 29.              Oral\n\nargument, if deemed desirable by the panel, will be scheduled in\n\ndue course.\n\n                                    By the Court:\n                                    /s/ Richard Cushing Donovan, Clerk\n\n\n\n\n[cc: Hon.
