Alan S. Noonan was fired from\n\nhis job as a salesman at Staples, Inc. for allegedly padding\n\nexpense reports.   A Staples executive then sent a mass e-mail to\n\nabout 1,500 employees informing them that Noonan had been fired for\n\nviolating the company's travel and expense policy.     Staples also\n\ndenied Noonan his severance benefits and refused to allow him to\n\nexercise his stock options, claiming that, under the terms of the\n\nagreements setting forth the right to these benefits, Noonan was\n\nineligible because he had been fired \"for cause.\"       Noonan sued\n\nStaples in Massachusetts court for libel and breach of those\n\nagreements, and Staples removed to federal court.      Both parties\n\nmoved for summary judgment, the district court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of Staples, and Noonan now appeals.\n\n          We initially affirmed the grant of summary judgment.\n\nNoonan v. Staples, Inc., 539 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2008).   But, on panel\n\nrehearing, we withdraw our prior opinion and issue this opinion in\n\nwhich we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\n\n                          I.   Background\n\n          Because this case comes to us on appeal from summary\n\njudgment, we relate the relevant facts in the light that most\n\nfavors the nonmovant, Noonan. Franceschi v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans\n\nAffairs, 514 F.3d 81, 83 (1st Cir. 2008).     Noonan was a Staples\n\nsales director who did much traveling for business and had to\n\ncompile expense reports to be reimbursed for travel, food, and\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fother business-related expenses.        Staples had a travel and expense\n\npolicy requiring employees to submit receipts for all expenses over\n\n$75, and for all meals regardless of price; to use their corporate\n\ncredit card for business expenses instead of their personal credit\n\ncard; and to book all work-related travel through Staples's travel\n\ndepartment.    Noonan claims, with support in the record, that these\n\ndirectives were irregularly enforced and often not followed by many\n\nemployees.\n\n            In November 2005, Staples discovered that an employee\n\nnamed James Dorman had been embezzling money from the company\n\nthrough fraudulent expense claims and fired him. It then undertook\n\nan audit of expense reports based on a sample of sixty-five\n\ntraveling employees in the North American Division, including\n\nNoonan.      Auditors investigating Noonan discovered a May 2005\n\nexpense report in which he had requested $1,622 in excess of what\n\nhe had actually spent.       The team also found that Noonan had used\n\nhis personal credit card for many of these purchases, had booked\n\nthe travel through a non-company travel agent, and had failed to\n\nsubmit all the required receipts.\n\n            These anomalies led Staples to assemble a special team,\n\ncomposed of certified accountants and a former police investigator,\n\nto   look   further   into   Noonan's   past   expense   reports.   Noonan\n\nadmitted to the team that he often \"pre-populated\" his reports\n\nbefore a given trip -- that is, he estimated what his expenses\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fwould be in advance, and submitted the report with these estimates,\n\nbut with (Noonan claims) the intention to amend the report later to\n\nthe extent the actual expenses differed from the estimates.     The\n\nteam found that Noonan had failed to enter such adjustments on a\n\nnumber of expense reports and discovered other anomalies, such as\n\nentries where the amount claimed was exactly $100 more than what\n\nthe item actually cost, and entries where decimal points had been\n\nshifted two places to the right (resulting, for example, in an\n\n$1,129 meal at an airport McDonald's, instead of $11.29).    Noonan\n\nalso committed errors in Staples's favor.   When the team asked him\n\nabout the large amounts of extra money that had been deposited into\n\nhis checking account, Noonan responded that he had not noticed.\n\n          Based on its findings, the team unanimously concluded\n\nthat Noonan had deliberately falsified the audited expense reports\n\nand, as a result, Staples fired him.   It sent him a letter stating\n\nthat he had been terminated \"for cause\" for violating the travel\n\nand expense policy and the company's Code of Ethics, and that he\n\nwas consequently ineligible for severance benefits.    The following\n\nday, Executive Vice-President Jay Baitler sent an e-mail to all the\n\nemployees in Staples's North American Division, a group whose\n\nprecise number is unknown and disputed, but that totaled somewhere\n\naround 1,500 people.   The e-mail stated as follows:\n\n          It is with sincere regret that I must inform\n          you of the termination of Alan Noonan's\n          employment   with   Staples.     A   thorough\n          investigation determined that Alan was not in\n\n                                -4-\n\f          compliance with our [travel and expenses]\n          policies.     As always, our policies are\n          consistently    applied    to   everyone   and\n          compliance is mandatory on everyone's part.\n          It is incumbent on all managers to understand\n          Staples['s] policies and to consistently\n          communicate, educate and monitor compliance\n          every single day.     Compliance with company\n          policies is not subject to personal discretion\n          and is not optional. In addition to ensuring\n          compliance, the approver's responsibility to\n          monitor and question is a critical factor in\n          effective management of this and all policies.\n\n          If you have any questions about Staples['s]\n          policies or Code of Ethics, call the Ethics\n          Hotline . . . or ask your human resources\n          manager.\n\n          Over the course of Noonan's employment, he and Staples\n\nentered into two stock-option agreements, dating respectively from\n\n1992 and 2004 (respectively, the \"1992 Stock-Option Agreement\" and\n\nthe \"2004 Stock-Option Agreement\").   The pertinent language in the\n\n1992 Stock-Option Agreement provided as follows:\n\n          [I]f [Noonan's] relationship with Staples is\n          terminated by Staples for \"cause\" (as defined\n          below) . . . the right to exercise this option\n          with respect to any shares not previously\n          exercised shall terminate immediately . . . .\n\n          \"Cause\" shall mean willful misconduct by\n          [Noonan] or willful failure to perform his or\n          her responsibilities in the best interests of\n          Staples (including, without limitation, breach\n          by   [Noonan]   of   any   provision    of   any\n          employment,       consulting,       advisory,\n          nondisclosure,    non-competition    or    other\n          similar   agreement    between   [Noonan]    and\n          Staples), as determined by Staples, which\n          determination shall be conclusive.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f(Emphasis added.)    The 2004 Stock-Option Agreement contained this\n\nlanguage, and added other grounds constituting \"cause,\" including\n\n\"violation by [Noonan] of the Code of Ethics or an attempt by\n\n[Noonan] to secure any improper personal profit in connection with\n\nthe business of Staples.\"\n\n          Six days before being fired, Noonan sent Staples a\n\n$290,714.40 check and notified it that he was exercising his vested\n\nright to purchase 23,825 shares of stock -- 22,700 governed by the\n\n1992 Stock-Option Agreement, and 1,125 governed by the 2004 Stock-\n\nOption Agreement. Staples returned the check uncashed, noting that\n\nthe investigation into Noonan's expense-reporting practices was\n\nongoing, and that if Staples ultimately terminated him for cause,\n\nhe would not be entitled to gains on the shares.             Staples did not\n\nultimately allow Noonan to exercise the stock options.\n\n          Noonan also had a severance agreement with Staples which\n\nstated that Staples would not be required to pay benefits if Noonan\n\nwas terminated \"for '[c]ause'\" -- that is, if Noonan \"wilfully\n\nfail[ed] to substantially perform [his] duties with Staples,\"\n\n\"violate[d]   the   Code   of   Ethics    or   attempt[ed]   to   secure   any\n\nimproper personal profit,\" or \"engage[d] in misconduct which is\n\ndemonstrably and materially injurious to Staples . . . .\"           On these\n\ngrounds, Staples did not give Noonan severance benefits.\n\n          Noonan, a Florida resident, filed suit in Massachusetts\n\nstate court; Staples, a Massachusetts corporation, removed to the\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fU.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.        Noonan's\n\ncomplaint alleged (1) libel based on the Baitler e-mail; (2) breach\n\nof the two stock-option agreements; and (3) breach of the severance\n\nagreement.1    Noonan moved for summary judgment on a portion of the\n\nlibel claim and on the claim alleging breach of the stock-option\n\nagreements; Staples filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on\n\nall counts in the complaint.     The district court granted summary\n\njudgment on behalf of Staples.       On the libel claim, the district\n\ncourt determined that what was stated in the e-mail was true, and\n\nthat Noonan had presented no evidence of actual malice on the part\n\nof Staples. On the breach-of-contract claims, the court found that\n\nNoonan had been fired for cause and that, pursuant to the terms of\n\nthe agreements, he was therefore ineligible for the stock options\n\nand benefits.    Noonan now appeals.\n\n                           II.   Discussion\n\n          A.    Standard of Review\n\n          We will affirm a district court's summary judgment where\n\n\"the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and\n\nany affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.\"    Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).     At summary judgment, the\n\ncourt's task is not \"'to weigh the evidence and determine the truth\n\n\n\n1\n   Noonan made two other claims that were also dismissed by the\ndistrict court. He does not appeal those dismissals.\n\n                                  -7-\n\fof the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for\n\ntrial.'\"   Asociación de Periodistas de P.R. v. Mueller, 529 F.3d\n\n52, 55 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,\n\n477 U.S. 242, 250 (1986)).    We accord plenary review to summary\n\njudgment and view the record in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmovant, drawing reasonable inferences in his favor. Franceschi,\n\n514 F.3d at 84.\n\n           B.   Libel Claim\n\n           Noonan claims first that Staples committed actionable\n\nlibel against him through the sending of the Baitler e-mail. Under\n\nMassachusetts law, a plaintiff alleging libel must ordinarily\n\nestablish five elements:      (1) that the defendant published a\n\nwritten statement; (2) of and concerning the plaintiff; that was\n\nboth (3) defamatory, and (4) false; and (5) either caused economic\n\nloss, or is actionable without proof of economic loss.2   Stanton v.\n\nMetro Corp., 438 F.3d 119, 124 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing White v.\n\nBlue Cross & Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., 809 N.E.2d 1034, 1036\n\n(Mass. 2004)); Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n,\n\n142 F.3d 26, 42 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting McAvoy v. Shufrin, 518\n\n\n2\n   The parties do not dispute that the first element of Noonan's\nlibel claim, which \"requires that the defendant communicate the\ndefamatory statement to a third party,\" White v. Blue Cross & Blue\nShield of Mass., Inc., 809 N.E.2d 1034, 1036 (Mass. 2004), was\nsatisfied by the sending of the Baitler e-mail to some 1,500\nStaples employees. The parties likewise do not dispute that the\ne-mail concerned the plaintiff, Noonan. Of the remaining three\nelements, only the element of falsity has been challenged on\nappeal.\n\n                                -8-\n\fN.E.2d 513, 517 (Mass. 1988)).     A statement is defamatory if it\n\n\"may reasonably be read as discrediting [the plaintiff] in the\n\nminds of any considerable and respectable class of the community.\"\n\nDisend v. Meadowbrook Sch., 604 N.E.2d 54, 55 (Mass. App. Ct. 1992)\n\n(citing Sharratt v. Housing Innovations, Inc., 310 N.E.2d 343, 346\n\n(Mass. 1974)); accord White, 809 N.E.2d at 1036.   Generally, under\n\nMassachusetts law, summary judgment for a libel defendant is\n\nappropriate if \"the publication is not reasonably capable of any\n\ndefamatory meaning, and cannot reasonably be understood in any\n\ndefamatory sense.\"   Sharratt, 310 N.E.2d at 345 (quoting King v.\n\nNe. Publ'g Co., 2 N.E.2d 486, 487 (Mass. 1936)); see also Smith v.\n\nSuburban Rests. Inc., 373 N.E.2d 215, 217 (Mass. 1978) (\"Inferences\n\nwhich might be drawn by a considerable and respectable segment of\n\nthe community can make a publication actionable.\"); Amtrak Prods.,\n\nInc. v. Morton, 410 F.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir. 2005) (in determining\n\nwhether statement was defamatory, courts ask what a \"reasonable\n\nreader\" would think upon reading it) (quoting Foley v. Lowell Sun\n\nPubl'g Co., 533 N.E.2d 196, 197 (Mass. 1989)).\n\n          Since a given statement, even if libelous, must also be\n\nfalse to give rise to a cause of action, the defendant may assert\n\nthe statement's truth as an absolute defense to a libel claim.\n\nMass. Sch. of Law at Andover, 142 F.3d at 42 (citing Bander v.\n\nMetro. Life Ins. Co., 47 N.E.2d 595, 598 (Mass. 1943)); McAvoy, 518\n\nN.E.2d at 517.   Massachusetts law, however, recognizes a narrow\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fexception to this defense:       the truth or falsity of the statement\n\nis immaterial, and the libel action may proceed, if the plaintiff\n\ncan   show    that   the   defendant   acted    with   \"actual    malice\"   in\n\npublishing the statement.       White, 809 N.E.2d at 1036 n.4 (citing\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 92).\n\n             Noonan argued before the district court, and reiterates\n\nbefore us, that Baitler's e-mail was both defamatory and false, and\n\nthus constituted actionable libel.             Staples countered that the\n\nevidence clearly established that Noonan did indeed violate the\n\ncompany's travel and expense policy, and that the e-mail was\n\nconsequently true and no libel action could lie.                 The district\n\ncourt sided with Staples, concluding that Noonan's libel claim\n\ncould not proceed as a matter of law because the Baitler e-mail was\n\ntrue:   even when viewed in the light most favorable to Noonan, the\n\nrecord demonstrates that he failed to comply with the policy.               Our\n\nreview of the record and Massachusetts law leads us to the same\n\nconclusion.      Thus, there is no triable issue of fact on the\n\nquestion of truth.\n\n             We focus first on Noonan's arguments concerning the\n\ne-mail's falsity, because if the evidence corroborates Staples's\n\nasserted defense that the e-mail's contents were true, then absent\n\nactual malice on the part of Staples, the libel claim must be\n\ndismissed regardless of whether the e-mail defamed Noonan. See id.\n\nat 1036.     Noonan does not seriously challenge that, on their face,\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fall the sentences in the e-mail were true.                 As the e-mail states\n\nand   the    record      bears   out,   Staples   did    indeed    commission      an\n\ninvestigation of Noonan's expense-reporting practices, and the\n\ninvestigators determined that he was not in compliance with the\n\ntravel and expense policy.          Even Noonan admits that he frequently\n\ndisregarded the letter of the policy, booking travel with non-\n\ncompany travel agents, using his personal credit card instead of\n\nthe company card, and failing to turn in receipts.                      Whether, as\n\nNoonan asserts, he actually saved Staples money -- through, for\n\nexample,     buying      cheaper   plane   tickets      from   online    agents    or\n\ncommitting mathematical or typographical errors on his expense\n\nreports in Staples's favor -- is immaterial.3                  Whether, as Noonan\n\nasserts, many other traveling employees also regularly disregarded\n\nthe policy is likewise irrelevant. Even taking these assertions as\n\naccurate, they do not change the simple fact relayed in the e-mail,\n\nand supported by the evidence in the record, that Staples fired\n\nNoonan      after   an    investigation    determined      him    to    be   out   of\n\ncompliance with the travel and expense policy.\n\n              Noonan urges us, however, to look beyond the letter of\n\nthe e-mail to the effect it must have had on its approximately\n\n1,500 recipients.         He argues that reasonable recipients could have\n\n\n\n3\n    For this reason, we need not attempt to determine whose\ncalculations -- Noonan's or Staples's -- were correct, or whether\nit was Noonan or Staples who received the ultimate windfall from\nNoonan's typographical and mathematical errors.\n\n                                        -11-\n\fread other passages in the e-mail and, viewing the e-mail in its\n\ntotality, drawn the inference that he arrogantly regarded Staples's\n\npolicies as subject to his personal whim and committed some sort of\n\ngrave misconduct -- grave enough that Baitler himself departed from\n\ncompany policy on employee privacy by referring to Noonan by name\n\nin the e-mail. Indeed, according to Noonan, the e-mail's reference\n\nto an \"investigation,\" the recent experience with the firing and\n\nlater indictment of Dorman for stealing money from the company, and\n\nthe fact that Staples took the drastic step of terminating Noonan\n\ninstead   of   merely   reprimanding       him    or   delaying    the   relevant\n\nreimbursements, could have led reasonable readers to conclude that\n\nhe, like Dorman, committed a crime.               At the very least, the e-\n\nmail's reference to the company Code of Ethics could have given\n\nreasonable readers the impression that Noonan was terminated for\n\nillegal   or   unethical   conduct    in    the    reporting      of   his   travel\n\nexpenses. As support for these arguments, Noonan cites a number of\n\ncases applying Massachusetts law and holding that, to determine\n\nwhether a given statement is defamatory, the court must look at it\n\nas a whole and in the context in which it was published.                      See,\n\ne.g., Stanton, 438 F.3d at 125, 128; Foley, 533 N.E.2d at 197\n\n(court must examine statement \"'in its totality in the context in\n\nwhich it was uttered or published[,] . . . consider[ing] all the\n\nwords used, not merely a particular phrase or sentence'\" (quoting\n\nMyers v. Boston Magazine Co., 403 N.E.2d 376, 379 (Mass. 1980));\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fSmith, 373 N.E.2d at 218; Sharratt, 310 N.E.2d at 346 (\"attendant\n\ncircumstances may be shown as proof of the defamatory nature of the\n\nwords\");   Disend,   604   N.E.2d    at    55   (\"Words    not     inherently\n\ndisparaging may . . . have that effect if viewed contextually,\n\ni.e., in the light of attendant circumstances.\" (citing Sharratt,\n\n310 N.E.2d at 346)).\n\n           Crucially, all of Noonan's cited cases concern how a\n\ncourt   determines   whether   a   given   statement   is,    or    could   be\n\nunderstood as, defamatory,4 and not with the separate inquiry of\n\nwhether the statement is true or false.            As noted above, the\n\nimpugned statement must be both defamatory and false for a libel\n\naction to lie, and these are distinct elements.           Without saying so\n\nexplicitly, Noonan is, in essence, asking us to import the corpus\n\nof legal principles for determining a statement's defamatory nature\n\ninto the examination of the statement's truth or falsity.             Noonan\n\nwants us to adopt a rule whereby even an objectively true statement\n\ncan give rise to a libel claim if reasonable readers might infer\n\nfrom it other, untrue characteristics of the plaintiff or conduct\n\nby him.\n\n\n4\n     Massachusetts courts engage in a similar inquiry when\ndetermining the second element of a libel claim -- whether the\nstatement is of or concerning the plaintiff. See, e.g., Stanton,\n438 F.3d at 128 (\"Like the question of whether a communication can\nreasonably be understood to be defamatory, whether a communication\ncan reasonably be understood to be of and concerning the plaintiff\ndepends on the circumstances.\" (citing New Eng. Tractor-Trailer of\nConn., Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., 480 N.E.2d 1005, 1010 n.5\n(Mass. 1985))).\n\n                                    -13-\n\f             Unfortunately for Noonan, our survey of the relevant\n\nMassachusetts     law   has    uncovered     no   clear   support     for    this\n\ninterpretation,     and   we    are   reluctant     to    recognize    such     a\n\nsignificant expansion in view of our limited role as a federal\n\ncourt sitting under our diversity jurisdiction.                 See Gill v.\n\nGulfstream Park Racing Ass'n, Inc., 399 F.3d 391, 402 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (\"A federal court sitting in diversity cannot be expected to\n\ncreate new doctrines expanding state law.\"); A. Johnson & Co., Inc.\n\nv. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 933 F.2d 66, 73 n.10 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(diversity plaintiff \"cannot expect this court 'to torture state\n\nlaw into strange configurations or precipitously to blaze new and\n\nunprecedented    jurisprudential      trails'\"    (quoting   Kotler     v.    Am.\n\nTobacco Co., 926 F.2d 1217, 1224 (1st Cir. 1990))).             Instead, the\n\nrelevant Massachusetts cases reveal the truth-or-falsity inquiry to\n\nbe a much simpler one.        Our review of the record in the light most\n\nfavorable to Noonan reveals no triable issue of fact because, as\n\nStaples asserts, everything said in the e-mail was true -- or at\n\nleast substantially true -- and substantial truth is all that is\n\nrequired.5    See Murphy v. Boston Herald, Inc., 865 N.E.2d 746, 754\n\n(Mass. 2007); Jones v. Taibbi, 512 N.E.2d 260, 266 (Mass. 1987).6\n\n\n5\n   Thus, even though Noonan may dispute whether the investigation\nwas, as the Baitler e-mail characterized it, \"thorough,\" this minor\ndetail does not deprive the e-mail of its substantially true\ncharacter.\n6\n  To the extent the brief discussion in Perry v. Hearst Corp., 334\nF.2d 800, 801-02 (1st Cir. 1964), suggests a different outcome, we\n\n                                      -14-\n\f          Given this holding, Noonan's only hope for keeping his\n\nlibel claim alive is to prove that Staples -- or other employees\n\nresponsible for composing and sending the e-mail -- acted with\n\nactual malice.   As noted above, under Massachusetts law, even a\n\ntrue statement can form the basis of a libel action if the\n\nplaintiff proves that the defendant acted with \"actual malice.\"\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 92; White, 809 N.E.2d at 1036 n.4;\n\nConroy v. Fall River Herald News Publ'g Co., 28 N.E.2d 729, 731-32\n\n(Mass. 1940).7\n\n          The relevant statute, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 92,\n\npassed in 1902, does not define the term \"actual malice.\"8   Noonan\n\nargues that the term \"actual malice\" refers to actual malevolent\n\nintent or ill will.   Though we initially concluded otherwise, on\n\nrehearing we now agree.\n\n\n\n\ndo not believe that such an outcome comports with Massachusetts law\nas it stands today.\n7\n   This exception to the truth defense is not constitutional when\napplied to matters of public concern. Shaari v. Harvard Student\nAgencies, Inc., 691 N.E.2d 925, 927 (Mass. 1998). In the rehearing\nproceedings, Staples has suggested that this exception to the truth\ndefense may never be constitutional.     But this argument is not\ndeveloped now and was not raised in the initial briefing.\nAccordingly, we do not consider it at this time. See Johnson v.\nMahoney, 424 F.3d 83, 96 (1st Cir. 2005).\n8\n   The statute provides, in its entirety: \"The defendant in an\naction for writing or for publishing a libel may introduce in\nevidence the truth of the matter contained in the publication\ncharged as libelous; and the truth shall be a justification unless\nactual malice is proved.\" Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 92.\n\n                               -15-\n\f             A 1903 case from the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court\n\nexplains that the term meant \"malicious intention.\"              Conner v.\n\nStandard Publ'g Co., 67 N.E. 596, 598 (Mass. 1903).            Since 1964,\n\nhowever, the term \"actual malice\" has taken on a new meaning in\n\ndefamation cases involving public figures; in this context, a\n\nperson acts with \"'actual malice'\" when he acts \"'with knowledge\n\nthat [a defamatory statement] was false or with reckless disregard\n\nof whether it was false or not.'\"          Cantrell v. Forest City Publ'g\n\nCo., 419 U.S. 245, 251 (1974) (alteration in original) (quoting New\n\nYork Times v. Sullivan, 376 U.S. 254, 280 (1964)).                But, the\n\nSupreme Court has explained that actual malice in the public-figure\n\ncontext is different than \"common-law malice\" or \"ill will,\" which\n\nis sometimes required under state law.          Id. at 251-52.\n\n             Though the Massachusetts statute at issue in this case\n\nalso uses the term \"actual malice,\" we are persuaded that we should\n\nnot   read   that   term   as   having   the   specialized   meaning   later\n\ndeveloped by the Supreme Court.             We had initially reached a\n\ndifferent conclusion after considering Rotkiewicz v. Sadowsky, 730\n\nN.E.2d 282 (Mass. 2000).        In that public-figure case, the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court stated that \"[i]n the context of defamation, the\n\nterm 'actual malice' does not mean the defendant's dislike of,\n\nhatred of, or ill will toward, the plaintiff,\" but rather whether\n\nthe defendant acted with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard\n\nfor whether a statement was true or false.           Id. at 289 (emphasis\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fadded).    Based on this language, we had concluded that the public-\n\nfigure definition of actual malice applied throughout \"the context\n\nof defamation.\"    See also Richard W. Bishop, 17A Mass. Practice §\n\n43.6 n.5 (supporting this conclusion).\n\n            We now reject this conclusion for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, since the statute was passed before the development of the\n\nmodern definition of actual malice, it would not be consistent with\n\nlegislative intent to read it as applying a more modern definition.\n\nSee Sullivan v. Chief Justice for Admin. & Mgmt. of the Trial\n\nCourt, 858 N.E.2d 699, 708 (Mass. 2006) (\"The object of all\n\nstatutory construction is to ascertain the true intent of the\n\nLegislature    from   the    words     used.\"     (quoting   Champigny   v.\n\nCommonwealth, 661 N.E.2d 931, 933 (1996))).9 Since the Legislature\n\nof 1902 could not have intended to apply the modern definition of\n\n\"actual malice,\" we will not apply it here, absent an explicit\n\ncontrary    interpretation    from     the      Supreme   Judicial   Court.\n\nRotkiewicz is not such precedent; it was a public-figure case and\n\nwas not interpreting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 92.            Rotkiewicz,\n\n730 N.E.2d at 289.\n\n            Second, the legal context supports construing \"actual\n\nmalice\" as \"ill will\" or \"malevolent intent.\"             First, since the\n\n\n\n9\n   Where necessary, we \"render interpretations of state law by\nusing the same methods that the state court would use.\" National\nPharms., Inc. v. Feliciano-de-Melecio, 221 F.3d 235, 241 (1st Cir.\n2000).\n\n                                     -17-\n\fstatute deals not with public figures, but with defenses under\n\ntraditional tort law, it is more appropriate to use the traditional\n\ntort law meaning of the term.            Second, application of the modern\n\nmeaning would produce the odd result that there would only be\n\nliability    for   true    statements     where       the    speaker   acted    with\n\nknowledge or recklessness as to the statement's falsity.                          The\n\nstatute, however, was not likely meant only to apply to the rare\n\ncase where a defendant utters a true statement which he seriously\n\ndoubts or sincerely disbelieves.               Finally, in the public-figure\n\ncontext, the \"actual malice\" test applies to statements of public\n\nconcern, an area in which defamatory true statements are not\n\nactionable at all.        See Phila. Newspapers v. Hepps, 475 U.S. 767,\n\n768-69   (1986)    (limiting     recovery      for    true    statements).     Thus,\n\napplying    this   test    in   the    case    of    true    statements   would   be\n\nincongruous, as the modern \"actual malice\" test does not normally\n\napply to true statements.             See Seideman v. City of Newton, 895\n\nN.E.2d 439, 444 (Mass. 2008) (\"Courts must ascertain the intent of\n\na statute from all its parts and from the subject matter to which\n\nit relates, and must interpret the statute so as to render the\n\nlegislation effective, consonant with sound reason and common\n\nsense.\").    For all these reasons, we conclude that Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 231, § 92 means \"common-law malice\" when it uses the term\n\n\"actual malice.\"      See also Shaari v. Harvard Student Agencies,\n\nInc., No. CA 907810D, 1996 WL 1186873, at *9 (Mass. Super. Ct.\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fJuly 19, 1996) (\"To establish 'actual malice,' as that term is used\n\nin § 92, plaintiff need only prove 'disinterested malevolence'\n\nrather than 'knowing falsity' or 'reckless disregard for the truth\n\non the part of the defendants.'\"), rev'd on other grounds by 691\n\nN.E.2d 925 (Mass. 1998).10 Although we recognize that in exercising\n\nour diversity jurisdiction we must tread lightly in offering\n\ninterpretations of state law where controlling precedent is scarce,\n\nGill, 399 F.3d at 402, we are also obliged to provide our \"best\n\nguess\" as to open questions of state law when necessary.            Liberty\n\nMutual Ins. Co. v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 260 F.3d 54, 65 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).      In   this   case,   we   conclude   that   the   relevant   state\n\nprecedents and the traditional canons of statutory construction\n\ndictate the interpretation provided above.\n\n            The district court concluded that there was no evidence\n\nof actual malice.        Viewing \"actual malice\" as \"ill will,\" we\n\ndisagree.    First, in Baitler's twelve years with the company, he\n\nhad never previously referred to a fired employee by name in an e-\n\nmail or other mass communication. From this evidence, a jury could\n\npermissibly infer that Baitler singled out Noonan in order to\n\n\n10\n    This conclusion is also supported by another Massachusetts\nAppeals Court case. In Mihalik, that court ruled that \"the meaning\nof 'actual malice' as used in [§ 92] plainly cannot be continued\nwith respect to public officers and public figures.\" Mihalik v.\nDuprey, 417 N.E.2d 1238, 1242 (Mass. App. Ct. 1981). If \"actual\nmalice\" in § 92 meant the same as it does in the public figure\ncases, the Mihalik court would not have needed to note the need for\na change, since the constitutional protection afforded by that\nstandard would already be in place.\n\n                                     -19-\n\fhumiliate him.   To be sure, Staples has offered a non-malicious\n\nexplanation.   Baitler stated in his deposition that he considered\n\nthe e-mail naming Noonan to be important in effectively making the\n\npoint to his employees that they must comply with Staples's travel\n\nand expense policies. But, a jury could nevertheless conclude that\n\nBaitler's explanation for the deviation from policy was pretextual.\n\nCf. Brennan v. GTE Gov't Sys. Corp., 150 F.3d 21, 29 (1st Cir.\n\n1998) (noting, in a discrimination case, that \"[d]eviation from\n\nestablished policy or practice may be evidence of pretext\").11\n\nFurther, should the jury reject this explanation, such conclusion\n\nmight lend further support to an inference of malicious intent.\n\nCf. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Prods., Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 147\n\n(2000) (noting, in the discrimination context, that \"[p]roof that\n\nthe defendant's explanation is unworthy of credence is simply one\n\nform of circumstantial evidence that is probative of intentional\n\ndiscrimination, and it may be quite persuasive\").   Considering the\n\nconflicting explanations evinced by the record, it is properly for\n\nthe jury to decide whether to credit Baitler's explanation or\n\ninstead to draw the competing inferences advanced by Noonan.\n\n\n\n11\n   Cf. Havlik v. Johnson & Wales Univ., 509 F.3d 25, 33-34 (1st\nCir. 2007) (rejecting plaintiff's argument that malice was shown by\na decision, which deviated from prior practice, to identify\nplaintiff in university crime alert, on the basis of the fact that\nthe identity of the suspect was not usually known in previous\ncases).   Unlike the defendant in Havlik, Staples has made no\nshowing that Noonan was not similarly situated to other previously\nfired Staples employees.\n\n                               -20-\n\f             Second, Baitler had supervised Dorman and had failed to\n\nnotice his misfeasance.       Moreover, Baitler did not send around a\n\nsimilar e-mail regarding Dorman's actions. Noonan explains that he\n\nwill argue to the jury that they should infer that Baitler singled\n\nout Noonan to detract attention away from the Dorman scandal.\n\nThese     facts,   while   speculative   on    their   own,    could   provide\n\nadditional background to support Noonan's pretext argument.\n\n             Third, Baitler sent the e-mail to a list of 1500 or 1600\n\nemployees of Staples.        Noonan contends that many individuals on\n\nthat list did not travel and so had no reason to be advised of the\n\ntravel policy.      Noonan will thus ask the jury to infer that the e-\n\nmail's excessive publication shows Baitler's, and thus Staples's,\n\nmalevolent desire to harm Noonan's reputation.                Cf. Dragonas v.\n\nSch. Comm. of Melrose, 833 N.E.2d 679, 687-88 (Mass. App. Ct. 2005)\n\n(explaining that \"excessive publication\" can show malice sufficient\n\nto defeat a conditional privilege).           The record is not clear as to\n\nthe identity and job description of each person who received the e-\n\nmail.12    But even in its present state, the record permits, though\n\n\n12\n    Noonan contends that Staples improperly deleted the original\nelectronic version of the e-mail despite Noonan's lawyer's written\nrequest. According to Noonan, this deletion made it impossible to\ndetermine exactly who was on the list and how many people the list\nincluded.   Noonan contends that the e-mail's deletion raises a\npermissible inference that the destroyed evidence shows excessive\npublication. We need not reach the issue of the destruction of the\ne-mail at this time, since the summary judgment record already\nestablishes that the e-mail was widely distributed.       As noted\nabove, whether that distribution was so wide as to show malice will\nbe a question for the jury.\n\n                                   -21-\n\fcertainly does not require, a conclusion that publication was\n\nexcessive     since    the     record     does    not    establish        that     the    wide\n\ndistribution was made only to those inside the \"narrow group who\n\nshared   an    interest       in    the   communication.\"            See    Draghetti       v.\n\nChmielewski, 626 N.E.2d 862, 867 (Mass. 1994).                       Thus, considering\n\nthe large number of recipients, a jury could find that Baitler\n\npublished the e-mail excessively.\n\n              In this case, the presence of these three pieces of\n\nevidence support inferences upon which a jury could base a verdict\n\nfor Noonan.     In this case, where \"motive and intent play a leading\n\nrole,    summary      judgment      should     not      be   granted\"      since        Noonan\n\npresented      evidence        beyond      conclusory         allegations          or     mere\n\nspeculation.        Barss v. Tosches, 785 F.2d 20, 22 (1st Cir. 1986)\n\n(affirming summary judgment as plaintiff rested on \"the mere\n\nallegation     of   an     illegal     motive     found      in    the    complaint,       and\n\nreiterated     in     an      affidavit\");        see    also      Aponte-Santiago          v.\n\nLópez-Rivera,       957    F.2d     40,   41   (1st     Cir.      1992)    (\"The    summary\n\njudgment standard 'remains particularly rigorous when the disputed\n\nissue turns on a question of motive or intent.'\" (quoting                           Lipsett\n\nv. University of Puerto Rico, 864 F.2d 881, 895 (1st Cir. 1988))).\n\nOf course, \"after the full presentation of the evidence at trial,\n\na factfinder might very well decide differently,\" but Noonan \"has\n\nraised a genuine issue of material fact as to the actual reason\"\n\nfor   publication        of   the    e-mail,      sufficient       to     defeat    summary\n\n\n                                           -22-\n\fjudgment.    Santiago-Ramos v. Centennial P.R. Wireless Corp., 217\n\nF.3d 46, 57 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            Staples      also   contends     that   a    conditional   privilege\n\napplies to protect Baitler's statements.                A privilege does protect\n\nstatements   \"'reasonably         related    to   the    employer's    legitimate\n\nbusiness interest.'\" Sklar v. Beth Israel Deaconess Med. Ctr., 797\n\nN.E.2d 381, 388 (Mass. App. Ct. 2003) (quoting Foley v. Polaroid\n\nCorp., 508 N.E.2d 72, 79 (Mass. 1987)).                   But, this conditional\n\nprivilege is also defeated by a showing of malice.                Dragonas, 833\n\nN.E.2d at 687 (defining malice in this context to be a \"base\n\nulterior motive,\" and including \"intention to injure another\").\n\nSo, if the jury finds actual malice sufficient to defeat the\n\nstatutory truth defense, the conditional privilege would also be\n\nvitiated.\n\n            C.    Breach of Stock-Option Agreements\n\n            Noonan next argues that the district court erred in\n\ngranting summary judgment to Staples on his claim that the latter\n\nbreached the two stock-option agreements by not allowing him to\n\nexercise his options. The district court noted the language in the\n\nagreements providing that Noonan was ineligible for the stock\n\noptions if Staples determined that his termination was \"for cause,\"\n\nand   dismissed    the    claim    because    \"Staples's      classification   of\n\n[Noonan's] actions as willful misconduct appears reasonable and\n\napplicable in the circumstances.\"\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\f          As an initial matter, we must ascertain the correct\n\nrubric through which to evaluate Noonan's assertion that he did\n\nnot, in fact, engage in willful misconduct or any other activity\n\nthat would qualify as cause for his firing.        Staples contends that\n\nwe are prohibited from reaching the merits of this question, as the\n\nstock-option agreements entrust the decision on what constitutes\n\n\"cause\" to Staples, and Staples alone.           It argues that several\n\ncourts have held similar clauses to be a valid limitation on\n\ncontractual remedies.      See, e.g., McIntyre v. Phila. Suburban\n\nCorp., 90 F. Supp. 2d 596, 600 (E.D. Pa. 2000); Stemerman v.\n\nAckerman, 184 A.2d 28, 33 (Del. Ch. 1962).         Noonan, by contrast,\n\nurges us to declare the relevant clauses in the agreements invalid\n\nbecause they violate public policy, because they allow Staples to\n\nbe the judge in its own case.   See, e.g., Ellis v. Emhart Mfg. Co.,\n\n191 A.2d 546, 549 (Conn. 1963) (clause in stock-option agreement\n\nviolated public policy by providing that board of directors'\n\ninterpretation was final and conclusive) (citing, inter alia,\n\nPatton v. Babson's Statistical Org., Inc., 156 N.E. 534, 536 (Mass.\n\n1927)).   Noonan invites us instead to engage in de novo review of\n\nwhether there was cause to fire him.        For the reasons explained\n\nbelow, the weight of authority pushes us onto a middle course\n\nbetween these two extremes.\n\n          The   question   we   must    answer   is   whether   Staples's\n\ncontractual prerogative to determine what constitutes \"cause\" is\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\funreviewable.      If so, the matter ends there and we need not look at\n\nthe evidence to determine whether cause did indeed exist for firing\n\nNoonan,    because    Staples     undisputably   determined     that       it    did.\n\nUnlike    the    inquiry   into   an   alleged   libel's     truth    or    falsity\n\ndiscussed above -- which Massachusetts courts have addressed -- our\n\nsurvey of Massachusetts law reveals no pronouncement by that\n\nstate's courts on this precise question.           Since this case rests on\n\ndiversity       jurisdiction,     we   must   attempt   to    divine       how   the\n\nMassachusetts courts, and in particular the Supreme Judicial Court,\n\nwould answer the question if faced squarely with it.                 See Hardy v.\n\nLoon Mt. Recreation Corp., 276 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2002); accord\n\nLiberty Mutual, 260 F.3d at 65 (\"Absent a decision by the state's\n\nhighest court, we are free to make our own best guess as to\n\nMassachusetts law . . . .\").           In coming up with our \"best guess,\"\n\nwe may look to analogous decisions from other jurisdictions.\n\nHardy, 276 F.3d at 20 (citing Stratford Sch. Dist., S.A.U. #58 v.\n\nEmployers Reins. Corp., 162 F.3d 718, 720 (1st Cir. 1998)); see\n\nalso Vigortone AG Prods., Inc. v. PM AG Prods., Inc., 316 F.3d 641,\n\n644 (7th Cir. 2002) (explaining that \"the best guess is that the\n\nstate's highest court, should it ever be presented with the issues,\n\nwill line up with the majority of the states\").               We may also find\n\nguidance in pronouncements on similar matters by Massachusetts\n\ncourts.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -25-\n\f               Staples points us to what is probably the most closely\n\nanalogous published case of the handful that exist dealing with\n\nthis question, Weir v. Anaconda Co., 773 F.2d 1073 (10th Cir.\n\n1985).     In that case, Weir and his former employer, the Anaconda\n\nCompany,       had    a    stock-option         plan     which     gave     an     Anaconda\n\ncompensation committee the sole authority to determine whether Weir\n\nhad been fired for cause, and was thereby precluded from exercising\n\na stock option.           Contrary to Staples's suggestion, however, the\n\nTenth Circuit did not hold that the compensation committee's cause\n\ndecision was unreviewable.                Id. at 1078.          Instead, according to\n\nthat court's reading of the applicable Kansas law, the committee's\n\ndecision should be treated in a manner similar to an agency\n\ndecision,       and    thus      reviewed       for    whether    it    was      arbitrary,\n\nfraudulent,      or     made     in     bad   faith.      Id.    at    1078-79.       After\n\nevaluating the evidence relating to Weir's firing in the light most\n\nfavorable to him, the court concluded that the committee's decision\n\nsuffered from none of these defects, and affirmed summary judgment\n\nin favor of Anaconda.            See id. at 1081-83.            Importantly, the court\n\nexpressly rejected Weir's request that it apply, as Noonan implores\n\nus   to   do    here,     a     fully    de   novo     standard    of     review    to   the\n\ncommittee's decision.             Id. at 1078.\n\n               Our survey of other jurisdictions has uncovered several\n\ncases adopting similar standards of review. See, e.g., Scribner v.\n\nWorldcom,      Inc.,      249    F.3d    902,    909    (9th    Cir.    2001)     (applying\n\n\n                                              -26-\n\fWashington      law,   court      reviews     stock-option     committee's\n\ninterpretation of plan's terms to determine whether it was made in\n\ngood faith); Craig v. Pillsbury Non-Qualified Pension Plan, 458\n\nF.3d 748, 752 (8th Cir. 2006) (similar); W.R. Berkley Corp. v.\n\nHall, No. Civ.A. 03C-12-146WCC, 2005 WL 406348, at *4 (Del. Super.\n\nCt. Feb. 16, 2005) (unpublished) (when stock-option committee is\n\nvested with final authority to determine rights under plan, court\n\nwill not second-guess its decision absent showing of fraud or bad\n\nfaith); Schwartz v. Century Circuit, Inc., 163 A.2d 793, 796 (Del.\n\nCh. 1960) (similar).      These standards, and that propounded by the\n\nWeir   court,   comport    with   the   standard   consistently   used    by\n\nMassachusetts courts for determining whether a government official\n\nacted properly in discharging another government employee.               See,\n\ne.g., Flomenbaum v. Commonwealth, 889 N.E.2d 423, 429 (Mass. 2008)\n\n(arbitrary or capricious); Levy v. Acting Governor, 767 N.E.2d 66,\n\n79 (Mass. 2002); McSweeney v. Town Manager of Lexington, 401 N.E.2d\n\n113, 117 (Mass. 1980); cf., e.g., Madera v. Marsh USA, Inc., 426\n\nF.3d 56, 63-64 (1st Cir. 2005) (where ERISA benefits plan gives\n\nplan   administrator      or   fiduciary    discretionary    authority    to\n\ndetermine employee's eligibility for benefits, the determination is\n\nsubject to an arbitrary and capricious standard of review, and the\n\ndecision must be upheld \"'if there is any reasonable basis for it'\"\n\n(quoting Brigham v. Sun Life of Can., 317 F.3d 72, 81 (1st Cir.\n\n2003)).\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\f          In view of this authority, our best prediction is that\n\nthe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court would hold that Staples's\n\n\"for cause\" decision is not unreviewable, nor reviewable de novo,13\n\nbut instead that the courts may perform a limited review of the\n\ndecision to determine if it was arbitrary, capricious, or made in\n\nbad faith.14   Even if we might disagree with Staples's action\n\nregarding Noonan's firing, if Staples's decision was not arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or made in bad faith, then we must accord it deference,\n\nand consequently affirm the denial of Noonan's stock options under\n\nthe plain terms of the agreements.     Cf., e.g., Mesnick v. Gen.\n\nElec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 825 (1st Cir. 1991) (courts are not \"super\n\npersonnel departments,\" and should not ordinarily second-guess\n\nemployers' business decisions).   In performing this portion of the\n\ninquiry, we adopt the definition of \"cause\" common to both stock-\n\n\n\n13\n   Noonan claims that we are bound by the Patton case, in which the\nSupreme Judicial Court held invalid a contractual clause giving a\ncompany president the sole authority to determine whether a fired\nemployee would receive a deferred salary. See Patton, 156 N.E.\nat 536. Yet Massachusetts courts strongly favor the freedom of\ncontract absent serious misconduct or fraud.      See, e.g., Sound\nTechniques, Inc. v. Hoffman, 737 N.E.2d 920, 927 (Mass. App. Ct.\n2000).    There is no evidence in the record that Noonan, a\nsophisticated party, was under duress when he signed onto the\nstock-option agreements, or that the agreements suffered from some\nother infirmity invalidating their plain terms.      In any event,\nPatton dates from 1927, and we do not think the Court would take\nthe same view today when faced with a modern stock-option agreement\nlike the two at issue here.\n14\n   At another point in its brief, Staples concedes that its cause\ndecision must have been made in good faith, and that we have the\nauthority to review the decision at least to that extent.\n\n                               -28-\n\foption agreements -- willful misconduct or willful failure to\n\nperform responsibilities in the best interests of Staples -- a\n\ndefinition    which   Noonan    seems    to    accept    as   applicable    here.\n\nCf. DiPietro v. Sipex Corp., 865 N.E.2d 1190, 1194 n.3 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 2007) (applying definition of \"for cause\" as set forth in the\n\nrelevant agreement).\n\n            Noonan argues that, while he undoubtedly committed a\n\nnumber of errors on the expense reports audited by Staples's\n\ninvestigation team, these were merely the result of inadvertence or\n\ncarelessness, and not a willful attempt to defraud Staples. At the\n\nvery least, Noonan contends, the determination of whether his\n\nconduct was willful involves looking into his state of mind, a\n\nquestion    ordinarily   reserved   for       the   jury.       See   Maimaron   v.\n\nCommonwealth, 865 N.E.2d 1098, 1109 (Mass. 2007).                Again, however,\n\nour task here -- and the jury's, if this claim were to survive\n\nsummary judgment -- is not to determine whether Noonan did indeed\n\nact willfully, but whether Staples's assessment that he acted\n\nwillfully    was   arbitrary,    capricious,        or   made    in   bad   faith.\n\nNotwithstanding a viewing of the evidence in Noonan's favor, we\n\nhold that there is no material fact in dispute on this issue.\n\n            Noonan does not dispute that the team of investigators\n\nwas competent and experienced.          The team looked at not just one or\n\ntwo of his expense reports, but at thirty-seven, spread across\n\n2005.   It uncovered dozens of instances in which Noonan claimed\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fmore than he was entitled to and determined unanimously that the\n\ndiscrepancies must have been intentional. Our review of the record\n\nreveals no material dispute of this fact.           Even if, in fact, the\n\ndozens   of   discrepancies   were    all   the   result   of   some   extreme\n\nsloppiness or inattentiveness on Noonan's part (as he rather\n\nunblushingly contends), we discern no triable issue of fact on\n\nwhether the team -- and the Staples officers who reviewed and acted\n\nupon the team's findings -- had a good-faith basis for concluding\n\nthat Noonan deliberately doctored these entries. For example, even\n\ntaking Noonan's $1,100 Big Mac as an honest keypadding slip (as\n\nNoonan claims it was), the several entries showing the item claimed\n\nas exactly $100 more than it actually cost are extremely damaging\n\nto Noonan's case.    The record reveals that the team found these to\n\nrefute his claim that the discrepancies were merely instances in\n\nwhich he pre-populated the expense report (that is, he guessed at\n\nhow much the item would cost) and simply forgot to go back and\n\ncorrect the entry later after he bought it and knew how much it\n\nactually cost.      Also damaging to Noonan's case, and taken into\n\naccount by the team, was his failure to notice (and his inability\n\nto explain this failure to the investigators) the large amounts of\n\nextra money being deposited into his account as a result of his\n\nover-reimbursements.15\n\n\n15\n   Another relevant factor is that Staples's termination letter to\nNoonan told him that he was being fired for cause. See Hammond v.\nT.J. Litle & Co., 82 F.3d 1166, 1175 (1st Cir. 1996) (applying\n\n                                     -30-\n\f          Therefore, regardless of whether Noonan also made errors\n\nthat, in the end, resulted in an ultimate windfall for Staples,16\n\nthe evidence viewed in Noonan's favor still shows highly suspicious\n\nexpense-reporting practices sufficient to ground a finding that\n\nNoonan intentionally manipulated at least some expense reports so\n\nthat he would receive money he did not deserve.          As Noonan\n\nrepeatedly argues or intimates, Staples may have been wiser to\n\nconduct yet another, even more searching investigation into his\n\nconduct; to give him a second chance before firing him; to impose\n\nsome less-severe form of discipline; or to punish other violators\n\nin the North American Division -- of whom Noonan claims there were\n\nmany -- with the same harsh penalty.   Nevertheless, even indulging\n\nNoonan all reasonable inferences, we cannot say that Staples's\n\ndecision that Noonan engaged in willful misconduct or willfully\n\nfailed to perform his duties in its best interest -- based as it\n\nwas on the findings of experienced auditors -- was arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or made in bad faith.\n\n          For these reasons, there is no triable issue of material\n\nfact with respect to Staples's decision that cause existed to fire\n\n\nMassachusetts law and remarking that \"when an employee may only be\nterminated for cause, whether the employer so informs the employee\nplays a decisive role in a court's later determination of whether\nthe employee was discharged for cause\").\n16\n    As noted above, the parties vigorously dispute which party\nreceived the ultimate windfall.    We need not determine who is\ncorrect on this question in order to resolve the issues presented\nin this appeal. See supra note 3.\n\n                               -31-\n\fNoonan, and under the plain terms of the stock-option agreements,\n\nStaples was thus entitled to determine Noonan ineligible for the\n\nstock options.   Accordingly, the district court did not err in\n\ngranting summary judgment to Staples on Noonan's claims concerning\n\nthe stock-option agreements, and we move on to his last ground of\n\nappeal.\n\n          D.   Breach of Severance Agreement\n\n          Lastly, Noonan contends that the district court erred in\n\ngranting summary judgment to Staples on his claim that it violated\n\nthe severance agreement.    We need not dwell long on this ground of\n\nappeal because it is foreclosed by the plain terms of the relevant\n\ninstruments.   The severance agreement provided that Noonan would\n\nnot receive his severance benefits if Staples terminated him \"for\n\n'[c]ause.'\" Another clause in the agreement provided that \"cause,\"\n\nfor purposes of the severance agreement, includes a violation of\n\nStaples's Code of Ethics.    The Code of Ethics, in turn, contained\n\nthe following provision:\n\n          We expect you to keep accurate records and\n          reports . . . . All company books, records,\n          and accounts must be maintained in accordance\n          with all applicable regulations and standards\n          and accurately reflect the transactions they\n          record. . . . We do not permit . . . false or\n          misleading entries in the company's books or\n          records for any reason. . . .\n\n          Even viewed in the light most favorable to Noonan, the\n\nevidence in the record readily shows that he failed to abide by\n\n\n\n                                -32-\n\fthis clause of the Code of Ethics.17      As Staples suggests, even if\n\nall of Noonan's many expense-reporting discrepancies were simply\n\ncareless     mistakes   or   instances   where   he   forgot   to   amend\n\npre-populated entries after figuring out what the item actually\n\ncost, the mere fact that he deliberately created inaccurate entries\n\nthrough the practice of pre-population transgresses this provision.\n\nThus, under the plain terms of the severance agreement, Noonan was\n\nfired for cause, as that term is specifically defined in that\n\nagreement.     See, e.g., Cabot Corp. v. AVX Corp., 863 N.E.2d\n\n503, 513 (Mass. 2007) (where a contract's language is unambiguous,\n\nits interpretation is a question of law that may be resolved on\n\nsummary judgment); Eigerman v. Putnam Invs., Inc., 877 N.E.2d 1258,\n\n1263 (Mass. 2007) (courts interpret contracts according to plain\n\nterms where these are unambiguous).      The district court therefore\n\nacted properly in determining that Noonan forfeited his entitlement\n\nto severance benefits, and summary judgment in favor of Staples on\n\nthis claim must stand.18\n\n\n\n17\n   The quoted language comes from the 2005 version of the Code of\nEthics.   Noonan seems to argue that he was bound by the 2001\nversion of the Code; Staples asserts that he was bound by the 2005\nversion.   We need not decide which party is correct, as the\nrelevant language in the 2001 version is identical.\n18\n    We add that the 2004 Stock-Option Agreement (but not the 1992\nStock-Option Agreement) also included violation of the Code of\nEthics as a ground constituting \"cause.\" Summary judgment in favor\nof Staples with respect to that agreement could therefore have been\naffirmed for this reason as an alternative to the ground discussed\nabove.\n\n                                  -33-\n\f                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of Staples as to all counts\n\nexcept Count I, the defamation count.   As to this count, we reverse\n\nand remand Noonan's claim for trial.\n\n          Affirmed in part, Reversed in part, and Remanded.\n\n          No costs awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                                -34-\n\f",

Alan S. Noonan was fired from\n\nhis job as a salesman at Staples, Inc. for allegedly padding\n\nexpense reports.   A Staples executive then sent a mass e-mail to\n\nabout 1,500 employees informing them that Noonan had been fired for\n\nviolating the company's travel and expense policy.     Staples also\n\ndenied Noonan his severance benefits and refused to allow him to\n\nexercise his stock options, claiming that, under the terms of the\n\nagreements setting forth the right to these benefits, Noonan was\n\nineligible because he had been fired \"for cause.\"       Noonan sued\n\nStaples in Massachusetts court for libel and breach of those\n\nagreements, and Staples removed to federal court.

U.S. Dep't of Veterans\n\nAffairs, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203122\"><a href=\"/opinion/203122/franceschi-v-us-dept-of-veterans-affairs/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 83 (1st Cir. 2008).     Noonan was a Staples\n\nsales director who did much traveling for business and had to\n\ncompile expense reports to be reimbursed for travel, food, and\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fother business-related expenses.        Staples had a travel and expense\n\npolicy requiring employees to submit receipts for all expenses over\n\n$75, and for all meals regardless of price; to use their corporate\n\ncredit card for business expenses instead of their personal credit\n\ncard; and to book all work-related travel through Staples's travel\n\ndepartment.    Noonan claims, with support in the record, that these\n\ndirectives were irregularly enforced and often not followed by many\n\nemployees.\n\n            In November 2005, Staples discovered that an employee\n\nnamed James Dorman had been embezzling money from the company\n\nthrough fraudulent expense claims and fired him. It then undertook\n\nan audit of expense reports based on a sample of sixty-five\n\ntraveling employees in the North American Division, including\n\nNoonan.      Auditors investigating Noonan discovered a May 2005\n\nexpense report in which he had requested $1,622 in excess of what\n\nhe had actually spent.       The team also found that Noonan had used\n\nhis personal credit card for many of these purchases, had booked\n\nthe travel through a non-company travel agent, and had failed to\n\nsubmit all the required receipts.\n\n            These anomalies led Staples to assemble a special team,\n\ncomposed of certified accountants and a former police investigator,\n\nto   look   further   into   Noonan's   past   expense   reports.   Noonan\n\nadmitted to the team that he often \"pre-populated\" his reports\n\nbefore a given trip -- that is, he estimated what his expenses\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fwould be in advance, and submitted the report with these estimates,\n\nbut with (Noonan claims) the intention to amend the report later to\n\nthe extent the actual expenses differed from the estimates.     The\n\nteam found that Noonan had failed to enter such adjustments on a\n\nnumber of expense reports and discovered other anomalies, such as\n\nentries where the amount claimed was exactly $100 more than what\n\nthe item actually cost, and entries where decimal points had been\n\nshifted two places to the right (resulting, for example, in an\n\n$1,129 meal at an airport McDonald's, instead of $11.29).    Noonan\n\nalso committed errors in Staples's favor.   When the team asked him\n\nabout the large amounts of extra money that had been deposited into\n\nhis checking account, Noonan responded that he had not noticed.\n\n          Based on its findings, the team unanimously concluded\n\nthat Noonan had deliberately falsified the audited expense reports\n\nand, as a result, Staples fired him.   It sent him a letter stating\n\nthat he had been terminated \"for cause\" for violating the travel\n\nand expense policy and the company's Code of Ethics, and that he\n\nwas consequently ineligible for severance benefits.    The following\n\nday, Executive Vice-President Jay Baitler sent an e-mail to all the\n\nemployees in Staples's North American Division, a group whose\n\nprecise number is unknown and disputed, but that totaled somewhere\n\naround 1,500 people.   The e-mail stated as follows:\n\n          It is with sincere regret that I must inform\n          you of the termination of Alan Noonan's\n          employment   with   Staples.     A   thorough\n          investigation determined that Alan was not in\n\n                                -4-\n\f          compliance with our [travel and expenses]\n          policies.     As always, our policies are\n          consistently    applied    to   everyone   and\n          compliance is mandatory on everyone's part.\n          It is incumbent on all managers to understand\n          Staples['s] policies and to consistently\n          communicate, educate and monitor compliance\n          every single day.     Compliance with company\n          policies is not subject to personal discretion\n          and is not optional. In addition to ensuring\n          compliance, the approver's responsibility to\n          monitor and question is a critical factor in\n          effective management of this and all policies.\n\n          If you have any questions about Staples['s]\n          policies or Code of Ethics, call the Ethics\n          Hotline . . . or ask your human resources\n          manager.\n\n          Over the course of Noonan's employment, he and Staples\n\nentered into two stock-option agreements, dating respectively from\n\n1992 and 2004 (respectively, the \"1992 Stock-Option Agreement\" and\n\nthe \"2004 Stock-Option Agreement\").   The pertinent language in the\n\n1992 Stock-Option Agreement provided as follows:\n\n          [I]f [Noonan's] relationship with Staples is\n          terminated by Staples for \"cause\" (as defined\n          below) . . . the right to exercise this option\n          with respect to any shares not previously\n          exercised shall terminate immediately . . . .\n\n          \"Cause\" shall mean willful misconduct by\n          [Noonan] or willful failure to perform his or\n          her responsibilities in the best interests of\n          Staples (including, without limitation, breach\n          by   [Noonan]   of   any   provision    of   any\n          employment,       consulting,       advisory,\n          nondisclosure,    non-competition    or    other\n          similar   agreement    between   [Noonan]    and\n          Staples), as determined by Staples, which\n          determination shall be conclusive.\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f(Emphasis added.)    The 2004 Stock-Option Agreement contained this\n\nlanguage, and added other grounds constituting \"cause,\" including\n\n\"violation by [Noonan] of the Code of Ethics or an attempt by\n\n[Noonan] to secure any improper personal profit in connection with\n\nthe business of Staples.\"\n\n          Six days before being fired, Noonan sent Staples a\n\n$290,714.40 check and notified it that he was exercising his vested\n\nright to purchase 23,825 shares of stock -- 22,700 governed by the\n\n1992 Stock-Option Agreement, and 1,125 governed by the 2004 Stock-\n\nOption Agreement. Staples returned the check uncashed, noting that\n\nthe investigation into Noonan's expense-reporting practices was\n\nongoing, and that if Staples ultimately terminated him for cause,\n\nhe would not be entitled to gains on the shares.             Staples did not\n\nultimately allow Noonan to exercise the stock options.\n\n          Noonan also had a severance agreement with Staples which\n\nstated that Staples would not be required to pay benefits if Noonan\n\nwas terminated \"for '[c]ause'\" -- that is, if Noonan \"wilfully\n\nfail[ed] to substantially perform [his] duties with Staples,\"\n\n\"violate[d]   the   Code   of   Ethics    or   attempt[ed]   to   secure   any\n\nimproper personal profit,\" or \"engage[d] in misconduct which is\n\ndemonstrably and materially injurious to Staples . . . .\"           On these\n\ngrounds, Staples did not give Noonan severance benefits.\n\n          Noonan, a Florida resident, filed suit in Massachusetts\n\nstate court; Staples, a Massachusetts corporation, removed to the\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fU.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.        Noonan's\n\ncomplaint alleged (1) libel based on the Baitler e-mail; (2) breach\n\nof the two stock-option agreements; and (3) breach of the severance\n\nagreement.1    Noonan moved for summary judgment on a portion of the\n\nlibel claim and on the claim alleging breach of the stock-option\n\nagreements; Staples filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on\n\nall counts in the complaint.     The district court granted summary\n\njudgment on behalf of Staples.       On the libel claim, the district\n\ncourt determined that what was stated in the e-mail was true, and\n\nthat Noonan had presented no evidence of actual malice on the part\n\nof Staples. On the breach-of-contract claims, the court found that\n\nNoonan had been fired for cause and that, pursuant to the terms of\n\nthe agreements, he was therefore ineligible for the stock options\n\nand benefits.    Noonan now appeals.\n\n                           II.   Discussion\n\n          A.

White, 809 N.E.2d at 1036 n.4 (citing\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 92).\n\n             Noonan argued before the district court, and reiterates\n\nbefore us, that Baitler's e-mail was both defamatory and false, and\n\nthus constituted actionable libel.             Staples countered that the\n\nevidence clearly established that Noonan did indeed violate the\n\ncompany's travel and expense policy, and that the e-mail was\n\nconsequently true and no libel action could lie.                 The district\n\ncourt sided with Staples, concluding that Noonan's libel claim\n\ncould not proceed as a matter of law because the Baitler e-mail was\n\ntrue:   even when viewed in the light most favorable to Noonan, the\n\nrecord demonstrates that he failed to comply with the policy.               Our\n\nreview of the record and Massachusetts law leads us to the same\n\nconclusion.      Thus, there is no triable issue of fact on the\n\nquestion of truth.\n\n             We focus first on Noonan's arguments concerning the\n\ne-mail's falsity, because if the evidence corroborates Staples's\n\nasserted defense that the e-mail's contents were true, then absent\n\nactual malice on the part of Staples, the libel claim must be\n\ndismissed regardless of whether the e-mail defamed Noonan. See id.\n\nat 1036.     Noonan does not seriously challenge that, on their face,\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fall the sentences in the e-mail were true.                 As the e-mail states\n\nand   the    record      bears   out,   Staples   did    indeed    commission      an\n\ninvestigation of Noonan's expense-reporting practices, and the\n\ninvestigators determined that he was not in compliance with the\n\ntravel and expense policy.          Even Noonan admits that he frequently\n\ndisregarded the letter of the policy, booking travel with non-\n\ncompany travel agents, using his personal credit card instead of\n\nthe company card, and failing to turn in receipts.                      Whether, as\n\nNoonan asserts, he actually saved Staples money -- through, for\n\nexample,     buying      cheaper   plane   tickets      from   online    agents    or\n\ncommitting mathematical or typographical errors on his expense\n\nreports in Staples's favor -- is immaterial.3                  Whether, as Noonan\n\nasserts, many other traveling employees also regularly disregarded\n\nthe policy is likewise irrelevant. Even taking these assertions as\n\naccurate, they do not change the simple fact relayed in the e-mail,\n\nand supported by the evidence in the record, that Staples fired\n\nNoonan      after   an    investigation    determined      him    to    be   out   of\n\ncompliance with the travel and expense policy.\n\n              Noonan urges us, however, to look beyond the letter of\n\nthe e-mail to the effect it must have had on its approximately\n\n1,500 recipients.         He argues that reasonable recipients could have\n\n\n\n3\n    For this reason, we need not attempt to determine whose\ncalculations -- Noonan's or Staples's -- were correct, or whether\nit was Noonan or Staples who received the ultimate windfall from\nNoonan's typographical and mathematical errors.\n\n                                        -11-\n\fread other passages in the e-mail and, viewing the e-mail in its\n\ntotality, drawn the inference that he arrogantly regarded Staples's\n\npolicies as subject to his personal whim and committed some sort of\n\ngrave misconduct -- grave enough that Baitler himself departed from\n\ncompany policy on employee privacy by referring to Noonan by name\n\nin the e-mail. Indeed, according to Noonan, the e-mail's reference\n\nto an \"investigation,\" the recent experience with the firing and\n\nlater indictment of Dorman for stealing money from the company, and\n\nthe fact that Staples took the drastic step of terminating Noonan\n\ninstead   of   merely   reprimanding       him    or   delaying    the   relevant\n\nreimbursements, could have led reasonable readers to conclude that\n\nhe, like Dorman, committed a crime.               At the very least, the e-\n\nmail's reference to the company Code of Ethics could have given\n\nreasonable readers the impression that Noonan was terminated for\n\nillegal   or   unethical   conduct    in    the    reporting      of   his   travel\n\nexpenses. As support for these arguments, Noonan cites a number of\n\ncases applying Massachusetts law and holding that, to determine\n\nwhether a given statement is defamatory, the court must look at it\n\nas a whole and in the context in which it was published.                      See,\n\ne.g., Stanton, 438 F.3d at 125, 128; Foley, 533 N.E.2d at 197\n\n(court must examine statement \"'in its totality in the context in\n\nwhich it was uttered or published[,] . . . consider[ing] all the\n\nwords used, not merely a particular phrase or sentence'\" (quoting\n\nMyers v.

As noted above, the\n\nimpugned statement must be both defamatory and false for a libel\n\naction to lie, and these are distinct elements.           Without saying so\n\nexplicitly, Noonan is, in essence, asking us to import the corpus\n\nof legal principles for determining a statement's defamatory nature\n\ninto the examination of the statement's truth or falsity.             Noonan\n\nwants us to adopt a rule whereby even an objectively true statement\n\ncan give rise to a libel claim if reasonable readers might infer\n\nfrom it other, untrue characteristics of the plaintiff or conduct\n\nby him.\n\n\n4\n     Massachusetts courts engage in a similar inquiry when\ndetermining the second element of a libel claim -- whether the\nstatement is of or concerning the plaintiff. See, e.g., Stanton,\n438 F.3d at 128 (\"Like the question of whether a communication can\nreasonably be understood to be defamatory, whether a communication\ncan reasonably be understood to be of and concerning the plaintiff\ndepends on the circumstances.\" (citing New Eng.

Though we initially concluded otherwise, on\n\nrehearing we now agree.\n\n\n\n\ndo not believe that such an outcome comports with Massachusetts law\nas it stands today.\n7\n   This exception to the truth defense is not constitutional when\napplied to matters of public concern.

In the rehearing\nproceedings, Staples has suggested that this exception to the truth\ndefense may never be constitutional.     But this argument is not\ndeveloped now and was not raised in the initial briefing.\nAccordingly, we do not consider it at this time.

Since 1964,\n\nhowever, the term \"actual malice\" has taken on a new meaning in\n\ndefamation cases involving public figures; in this context, a\n\nperson acts with \"'actual malice'\" when he acts \"'with knowledge\n\nthat [a defamatory statement] was false or with reckless disregard\n\nof whether it was false or not.'\"          Cantrell v.

But, the\n\nSupreme Court has explained that actual malice in the public-figure\n\ncontext is different than \"common-law malice\" or \"ill will,\" which\n\nis sometimes required under state law.          Id. at 251-52.\n\n             Though the Massachusetts statute at issue in this case\n\nalso uses the term \"actual malice,\" we are persuaded that we should\n\nnot   read   that   term   as   having   the   specialized   meaning   later\n\ndeveloped by the Supreme Court.             We had initially reached a\n\ndifferent conclusion after considering Rotkiewicz v. Sadowsky, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">730</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Mass. 2000).        In that public-figure case, the Supreme\n\nJudicial Court stated that \"[i]n the context of defamation, the\n\nterm 'actual malice' does not mean the defendant's dislike of,\n\nhatred of, or ill will toward, the plaintiff,\" but rather whether\n\nthe defendant acted with knowledge of falsity or reckless disregard\n\nfor whether a statement was true or false.           Id. at 289 (emphasis\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fadded).    Based on this language, we had concluded that the public-\n\nfigure definition of actual malice applied throughout \"the context\n\nof defamation.\"    See also Richard W. Bishop, 17A Mass. Practice §\n\n43.6 n.5 (supporting this conclusion).\n\n            We now reject this conclusion for a number of reasons.\n\nFirst, since the statute was passed before the development of the\n\nmodern definition of actual malice, it would not be consistent with\n\nlegislative intent to read it as applying a more modern definition.\n\nSee Sullivan v. Chief Justice for Admin. & Mgmt. of the Trial\n\nCourt, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">858</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">699</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 708 (Mass. 2006) (\"The object of all\n\nstatutory construction is to ascertain the true intent of the\n\nLegislature    from   the    words     used.\"     (quoting   Champigny   v.\n\nCommonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">661</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">931</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 933 (1996))).9 Since the Legislature\n\nof 1902 could not have intended to apply the modern definition of\n\n\"actual malice,\" we will not apply it here, absent an explicit\n\ncontrary    interpretation    from     the      Supreme   Judicial   Court.\n\nRotkiewicz is not such precedent; it was a public-figure case and\n\nwas not interpreting Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 92.            Rotkiewicz,\n\n730 N.E.2d at 289.\n\n            Second, the legal context supports construing \"actual\n\nmalice\" as \"ill will\" or \"malevolent intent.\"             First, since the\n\n\n\n9\n   Where necessary, we \"render interpretations of state law by\nusing the same methods that the state court would use.\" National\nPharms., Inc. v.

Second, application of the modern\n\nmeaning would produce the odd result that there would only be\n\nliability    for   true    statements     where       the    speaker   acted    with\n\nknowledge or recklessness as to the statement's falsity.                          The\n\nstatute, however, was not likely meant only to apply to the rare\n\ncase where a defendant utters a true statement which he seriously\n\ndoubts or sincerely disbelieves.               Finally, in the public-figure\n\ncontext, the \"actual malice\" test applies to statements of public\n\nconcern, an area in which defamatory true statements are not\n\nactionable at all.        See Phila. Newspapers v. Hepps, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111628\"><a href=\"/opinion/111628/philadelphia-newspapers-inc-v-hepps/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">767</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n768-69   (1986)    (limiting     recovery      for    true    statements).     Thus,\n\napplying    this   test    in   the    case    of    true    statements   would   be\n\nincongruous, as the modern \"actual malice\" test does not normally\n\napply to true statements.             See Seideman v.

For all these reasons, we conclude that Mass. Gen. Laws\n\nch. 231, § 92 means \"common-law malice\" when it uses the term\n\n\"actual malice.\"      See also Shaari v.

In   this   case,   we   conclude   that   the   relevant   state\n\nprecedents and the traditional canons of statutory construction\n\ndictate the interpretation provided above.\n\n            The district court concluded that there was no evidence\n\nof actual malice.        Viewing \"actual malice\" as \"ill will,\" we\n\ndisagree.    First, in Baitler's twelve years with the company, he\n\nhad never previously referred to a fired employee by name in an e-\n\nmail or other mass communication.

If \"actual\nmalice\" in § 92 meant the same as it does in the public figure\ncases, the Mihalik court would not have needed to note the need for\na change, since the constitutional protection afforded by that\nstandard would already be in place.\n\n                                     -19-\n\fhumiliate him.   To be sure, Staples has offered a non-malicious\n\nexplanation.   Baitler stated in his deposition that he considered\n\nthe e-mail naming Noonan to be important in effectively making the\n\npoint to his employees that they must comply with Staples's travel\n\nand expense policies. But, a jury could nevertheless conclude that\n\nBaitler's explanation for the deviation from policy was pretextual.\n\nCf. Brennan v. GTE Gov't Sys.

Considering the\n\nconflicting explanations evinced by the record, it is properly for\n\nthe jury to decide whether to credit Baitler's explanation or\n\ninstead to draw the competing inferences advanced by Noonan.\n\n\n\n11\n   Cf. Havlik v. Johnson & Wales Univ., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203053\"><a href=\"/opinion/203053/havlik-v-johnson-wales-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 33-34 (1st\nCir. 2007) (rejecting plaintiff's argument that malice was shown by\na decision, which deviated from prior practice, to identify\nplaintiff in university crime alert, on the basis of the fact that\nthe identity of the suspect was not usually known in previous\ncases).   Unlike the defendant in Havlik, Staples has made no\nshowing that Noonan was not similarly situated to other previously\nfired Staples employees.\n\n                               -20-\n\f             Second, Baitler had supervised Dorman and had failed to\n\nnotice his misfeasance.       Moreover, Baitler did not send around a\n\nsimilar e-mail regarding Dorman's actions. Noonan explains that he\n\nwill argue to the jury that they should infer that Baitler singled\n\nout Noonan to detract attention away from the Dorman scandal.\n\nThese     facts,   while   speculative   on    their   own,    could   provide\n\nadditional background to support Noonan's pretext argument.\n\n             Third, Baitler sent the e-mail to a list of 1500 or 1600\n\nemployees of Staples.        Noonan contends that many individuals on\n\nthat list did not travel and so had no reason to be advised of the\n\ntravel policy.      Noonan will thus ask the jury to infer that the e-\n\nmail's excessive publication shows Baitler's, and thus Staples's,\n\nmalevolent desire to harm Noonan's reputation.                Cf. Dragonas v.\n\nSch.

The record is not clear as to\n\nthe identity and job description of each person who received the e-\n\nmail.12    But even in its present state, the record permits, though\n\n\n12\n    Noonan contends that Staples improperly deleted the original\nelectronic version of the e-mail despite Noonan's lawyer's written\nrequest. According to Noonan, this deletion made it impossible to\ndetermine exactly who was on the list and how many people the list\nincluded.   Noonan contends that the e-mail's deletion raises a\npermissible inference that the destroyed evidence shows excessive\npublication. We need not reach the issue of the destruction of the\ne-mail at this time, since the summary judgment record already\nestablishes that the e-mail was widely distributed.       As noted\nabove, whether that distribution was so wide as to show malice will\nbe a question for the jury.\n\n                                   -21-\n\fcertainly does not require, a conclusion that publication was\n\nexcessive     since    the     record     does    not    establish        that     the    wide\n\ndistribution was made only to those inside the \"narrow group who\n\nshared   an    interest       in    the   communication.\"            See    Draghetti       v.\n\nChmielewski, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">626</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">862</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 867 (Mass. 1994).

The district court noted the language in the\n\nagreements providing that Noonan was ineligible for the stock\n\noptions if Staples determined that his termination was \"for cause,\"\n\nand   dismissed    the    claim    because    \"Staples's      classification   of\n\n[Noonan's] actions as willful misconduct appears reasonable and\n\napplicable in the circumstances.\"\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\f          As an initial matter, we must ascertain the correct\n\nrubric through which to evaluate Noonan's assertion that he did\n\nnot, in fact, engage in willful misconduct or any other activity\n\nthat would qualify as cause for his firing.        Staples contends that\n\nwe are prohibited from reaching the merits of this question, as the\n\nstock-option agreements entrust the decision on what constitutes\n\n\"cause\" to Staples, and Staples alone.           It argues that several\n\ncourts have held similar clauses to be a valid limitation on\n\ncontractual remedies.      See, e.g., McIntyre v. Phila.

In that case, Weir and his former employer, the Anaconda\n\nCompany,       had    a    stock-option         plan     which     gave     an     Anaconda\n\ncompensation committee the sole authority to determine whether Weir\n\nhad been fired for cause, and was thereby precluded from exercising\n\na stock option.           Contrary to Staples's suggestion, however, the\n\nTenth Circuit did not hold that the compensation committee's cause\n\ndecision was unreviewable.                Id. at 1078.          Instead, according to\n\nthat court's reading of the applicable Kansas law, the committee's\n\ndecision should be treated in a manner similar to an agency\n\ndecision,       and    thus      reviewed       for    whether    it    was      arbitrary,\n\nfraudulent,      or     made     in     bad   faith.      Id.    at    1078-79.       After\n\nevaluating the evidence relating to Weir's firing in the light most\n\nfavorable to him, the court concluded that the committee's decision\n\nsuffered from none of these defects, and affirmed summary judgment\n\nin favor of Anaconda.            See id. at 1081-83.            Importantly, the court\n\nexpressly rejected Weir's request that it apply, as Noonan implores\n\nus   to   do    here,     a     fully    de   novo     standard    of     review    to   the\n\ncommittee's decision.

In performing this portion of the\n\ninquiry, we adopt the definition of \"cause\" common to both stock-\n\n\n\n13\n   Noonan claims that we are bound by the Patton case, in which the\nSupreme Judicial Court held invalid a contractual clause giving a\ncompany president the sole authority to determine whether a fired\nemployee would receive a deferred salary. See Patton, 156 N.E.\nat 536. Yet Massachusetts courts strongly favor the freedom of\ncontract absent serious misconduct or fraud.      See, e.g., Sound\nTechniques, Inc. v. Hoffman, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 927 (Mass. App. Ct.\n2000).    There is no evidence in the record that Noonan, a\nsophisticated party, was under duress when he signed onto the\nstock-option agreements, or that the agreements suffered from some\nother infirmity invalidating their plain terms.      In any event,\nPatton dates from 1927, and we do not think the Court would take\nthe same view today when faced with a modern stock-option agreement\nlike the two at issue here.\n14\n   At another point in its brief, Staples concedes that its cause\ndecision must have been made in good faith, and that we have the\nauthority to review the decision at least to that extent.\n\n                               -28-\n\foption agreements -- willful misconduct or willful failure to\n\nperform responsibilities in the best interests of Staples -- a\n\ndefinition    which   Noonan    seems    to    accept    as   applicable    here.\n\nCf. DiPietro v. Sipex Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1194 n.3 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 2007) (applying definition of \"for cause\" as set forth in the\n\nrelevant agreement).\n\n            Noonan argues that, while he undoubtedly committed a\n\nnumber of errors on the expense reports audited by Staples's\n\ninvestigation team, these were merely the result of inadvertence or\n\ncarelessness, and not a willful attempt to defraud Staples. At the\n\nvery least, Noonan contends, the determination of whether his\n\nconduct was willful involves looking into his state of mind, a\n\nquestion    ordinarily   reserved   for       the   jury.       See   Maimaron   v.\n\nCommonwealth, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1098</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1109 (Mass. 2007).                Again, however,\n\nour task here -- and the jury's, if this claim were to survive\n\nsummary judgment -- is not to determine whether Noonan did indeed\n\nact willfully, but whether Staples's assessment that he acted\n\nwillfully    was   arbitrary,    capricious,        or   made    in   bad   faith.\n\nNotwithstanding a viewing of the evidence in Noonan's favor, we\n\nhold that there is no material fact in dispute on this issue.\n\n            Noonan does not dispute that the team of investigators\n\nwas competent and experienced.          The team looked at not just one or\n\ntwo of his expense reports, but at thirty-seven, spread across\n\n2005.   It uncovered dozens of instances in which Noonan claimed\n\n\n                                    -29-\n\fmore than he was entitled to and determined unanimously that the\n\ndiscrepancies must have been intentional. Our review of the record\n\nreveals no material dispute of this fact.           Even if, in fact, the\n\ndozens   of   discrepancies   were    all   the   result   of   some   extreme\n\nsloppiness or inattentiveness on Noonan's part (as he rather\n\nunblushingly contends), we discern no triable issue of fact on\n\nwhether the team -- and the Staples officers who reviewed and acted\n\nupon the team's findings -- had a good-faith basis for concluding\n\nthat Noonan deliberately doctored these entries. For example, even\n\ntaking Noonan's $1,100 Big Mac as an honest keypadding slip (as\n\nNoonan claims it was), the several entries showing the item claimed\n\nas exactly $100 more than it actually cost are extremely damaging\n\nto Noonan's case.    The record reveals that the team found these to\n\nrefute his claim that the discrepancies were merely instances in\n\nwhich he pre-populated the expense report (that is, he guessed at\n\nhow much the item would cost) and simply forgot to go back and\n\ncorrect the entry later after he bought it and knew how much it\n\nactually cost.      Also damaging to Noonan's case, and taken into\n\naccount by the team, was his failure to notice (and his inability\n\nto explain this failure to the investigators) the large amounts of\n\nextra money being deposited into his account as a result of his\n\nover-reimbursements.15\n\n\n15\n   Another relevant factor is that Staples's termination letter to\nNoonan told him that he was being fired for cause. See Hammond v.\nT.J. Litle & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717545\"><a href=\"/opinion/717545/scott-p-hammond-v-tj-litle-company-inc-cross-appellee/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1175 (1st Cir. 1996) (applying\n\n                                     -30-\n\f          Therefore, regardless of whether Noonan also made errors\n\nthat, in the end, resulted in an ultimate windfall for Staples,16\n\nthe evidence viewed in Noonan's favor still shows highly suspicious\n\nexpense-reporting practices sufficient to ground a finding that\n\nNoonan intentionally manipulated at least some expense reports so\n\nthat he would receive money he did not deserve.          As Noonan\n\nrepeatedly argues or intimates, Staples may have been wiser to\n\nconduct yet another, even more searching investigation into his\n\nconduct; to give him a second chance before firing him; to impose\n\nsome less-severe form of discipline; or to punish other violators\n\nin the North American Division -- of whom Noonan claims there were\n\nmany -- with the same harsh penalty.   Nevertheless, even indulging\n\nNoonan all reasonable inferences, we cannot say that Staples's\n\ndecision that Noonan engaged in willful misconduct or willfully\n\nfailed to perform his duties in its best interest -- based as it\n\nwas on the findings of experienced auditors -- was arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or made in bad faith.\n\n          For these reasons, there is no triable issue of material\n\nfact with respect to Staples's decision that cause existed to fire\n\n\nMassachusetts law and remarking that \"when an employee may only be\nterminated for cause, whether the employer so informs the employee\nplays a decisive role in a court's later determination of whether\nthe employee was discharged for cause\").\n16\n    As noted above, the parties vigorously dispute which party\nreceived the ultimate windfall.    We need not determine who is\ncorrect on this question in order to resolve the issues presented\nin this appeal. See supra note 3.\n\n                               -31-\n\fNoonan, and under the plain terms of the stock-option agreements,\n\nStaples was thus entitled to determine Noonan ineligible for the\n\nstock options.   Accordingly, the district court did not err in\n\ngranting summary judgment to Staples on Noonan's claims concerning\n\nthe stock-option agreements, and we move on to his last ground of\n\nappeal.\n\n          D.   Breach of Severance Agreement\n\n          Lastly, Noonan contends that the district court erred in\n\ngranting summary judgment to Staples on his claim that it violated\n\nthe severance agreement.    We need not dwell long on this ground of\n\nappeal because it is foreclosed by the plain terms of the relevant\n\ninstruments.   The severance agreement provided that Noonan would\n\nnot receive his severance benefits if Staples terminated him \"for\n\n'[c]ause.'\" Another clause in the agreement provided that \"cause,\"\n\nfor purposes of the severance agreement, includes a violation of\n\nStaples's Code of Ethics.    The Code of Ethics, in turn, contained\n\nthe following provision:\n\n          We expect you to keep accurate records and\n          reports . . . . All company books, records,\n          and accounts must be maintained in accordance\n          with all applicable regulations and standards\n          and accurately reflect the transactions they\n          record. . . . We do not permit . . . false or\n          misleading entries in the company's books or\n          records for any reason. . . .\n\n          Even viewed in the light most favorable to Noonan, the\n\nevidence in the record readily shows that he failed to abide by\n\n\n\n                                -32-\n\fthis clause of the Code of Ethics.17      As Staples suggests, even if\n\nall of Noonan's many expense-reporting discrepancies were simply\n\ncareless     mistakes   or   instances   where   he   forgot   to   amend\n\npre-populated entries after figuring out what the item actually\n\ncost, the mere fact that he deliberately created inaccurate entries\n\nthrough the practice of pre-population transgresses this provision.\n\nThus, under the plain terms of the severance agreement, Noonan was\n\nfired for cause, as that term is specifically defined in that\n\nagreement.     See, e.g., Cabot Corp. v. AVX Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">503</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 513 (Mass. 2007) (where a contract's language is unambiguous,\n\nits interpretation is a question of law that may be resolved on\n\nsummary judgment); Eigerman v.

Noonan seems to argue that he was bound by the 2001\nversion of the Code; Staples asserts that he was bound by the 2005\nversion.   We need not decide which party is correct, as the\nrelevant language in the 2001 version is identical.\n18\n    We add that the 2004 Stock-Option Agreement (but not the 1992\nStock-Option Agreement) also included violation of the Code of\nEthics as a ground constituting \"cause.\" Summary judgment in favor\nof Staples with respect to that agreement could therefore have been\naffirmed for this reason as an alternative to the ground discussed\nabove.\n\n                                  -33-\n\f                         III.
