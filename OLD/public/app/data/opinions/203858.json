Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                       Boudin, Selya and Lipez,\n                           Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Cynthia A. Young, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Michael J.\nSullivan, United States Attorney, on motion for summary\ndisposition.\n     Robert B. Mann and Mann and Mitchell on brief for appellant.\n\n\n\n                            June 8, 2009\n\f              Per Curiam.      Luis Zayas appeals from the statutory\n\nmandatory minimum sentence of 120 months that was imposed following\n\nhis   guilty    plea   to   possession   with    intent   to    distribute   and\n\nconspiracy to possess with intent to distribute and to distribute\n\nfifty or more grams of cocaine base.            He challenges the sentencing\n\ncourt's determination that he was an \"organizer, leader, manager,\n\nor supervisor,\" warranting a two-level increase in his offense\n\nlevel pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(c), and precluding safety-valve\n\nrelief pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(4).                The government has\n\nmoved for summary affirmance. Only the sufficiency of the evidence\n\nclaim was raised at sentencing; as to all of appellant's other\n\nclaims, plain error review applies.         For the following reasons, we\n\ngrant   the     government's    motion    and    summarily     affirm    Zayas's\n\nsentence.\n\n              I. Judicial Factfinding Re: Safety-Valve Eligibility\n\n              Zayas relies upon Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466\n\n(2000), Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), and Cunningham\n\nv. California, 549 U.S. 270 (2007), to argue that the district\n\ncourt was prohibited by the Sixth Amendment from making factual\n\nfindings that rendered him ineligible for safety-valve relief by a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.           Zayas concedes that this court's\n\ndecision in United States v. Bermudez, 407 F.3d 536 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\nis on point; that opinion held under similar circumstances that\n\nBlakely   was    not   implicated   when    judge-found        facts    precluded\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fapplication of the safety-valve to authorize a lower sentence. Id.\n\nat 545.\n\n          Zayas's argument is that Bermudez was decided before the\n\nSupreme Court issued its decision in Cunningham, and is no longer\n\ngood law after Cunningham.      Specifically, Zayas contends that the\n\nrole-in-the-offense factfinding by the sentencing court had the\n\neffect of increasing the \"statutory maximum,\" as that term is\n\ndefined in Cunningham, 549 U.S. at 275.\n\n          Zayas's reliance on Cunningham is misplaced.            The Court\n\nheld there that California's determinate sentencing law \"by placing\n\nsentence-elevating     factfinding     within   the     judge's   province,\"\n\nviolated the defendant's Sixth Amendment right to jury trial,\n\nfollowing Apprendi, Blakely and United States v. Booker, 543 U.S.\n\n220 (2005).    Cunningham, 549 U.S. at 274 (emphasis added).             The\n\nCunningham    Court   applied   the   definition   of    statutory   maximum\n\narticulated in Blakely, 542 U.S. at 303-304:\n\n          \"[T]he relevant 'statutory maximum,'\" this\n          Court has clarified, \"is not the maximum\n          sentence a judge may impose after finding\n          additional facts, but the maximum he may\n          impose without any additional findings.\"\n          Blakely, 542 U.S., at 303-304 (emphasis in\n          original).\n\nCunningham, 549 U.S. at 275.\n\n          In Zayas's case, the statutory maximum sentence that he\n\ncould receive based solely upon his guilty plea to counts 1 and 4,\n\nwhich specified drug quantities of fifty or more grams of cocaine\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fbase, was life in prison and the minimum was ten years. See 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(iii).      Therefore, using the definition employed in\n\nCunningham, the relevant \"statutory maximum\" was a life sentence.\n\nClearly, no judicial factfinding resulted in imposition of a\n\nsentence above that level.      To the contrary, judicial factfinding\n\nregarding Zayas's role in the offense resulted in his receiving the\n\nstatutory minimum sentence.\n\n            Before   and   after   Cunningham,   refusal   to   reduce    a\n\nstatutory sentence based on judicial factfinding does not violate\n\nthe Sixth Amendment. Bermudez, 407 F.3d at 545.        There was no error\n\nin the sentencing court's reliance upon judicial factfinding in\n\ndetermining that Zayas was ineligible for safety-valve relief.\n\n            II. Mandatory Application of Safety-Valve Criteria after\n            Booker\n\n            Zayas argues that the district court erred in concluding\n\nthat it did not have the authority to sentence him below the\n\nmandatory minimum sentence because he did not satisfy all the\n\nsafety-valve factors.       He contends that because the safety-valve\n\nrequirements    reference    the   guidelines    and   Booker   made     the\n\nguidelines advisory, then the safety-valve requirements are also\n\nadvisory.    That argument has been rejected by all the courts of\n\nappeals that have considered it.          See, e.g., United States v.\n\nTanner, 544 F.3d 793, 795 (7th Cir. 2008) (holding that the\n\nsentencing judge \"cannot treat as advisory the guideline provisions\n\nthat are preconditions for safety-valve relief, namely 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n                                    -4-\n\f3553(f)(1) and (4)\"); United States v. McKoy, 452 F.3d 234, 240 (3d\n\nCir. 2006) (reasoning that \"[i]nterpreting § 3553(f) as advisory\n\nwould effectively excise that section from the statute,\" and\n\ntherefore would be inconsistent with Booker, which left § 3553(f)\n\nintact).   We agree.        Thus, Zayas has failed to demonstrate that the\n\nsentencing court erred in treating § 3553(f) as mandatory rather\n\nthan advisory.\n\n           III. Allocation of Burden re: Safety-Valve Prerequisites\n\n           Appellant argues that because the statutory provision, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(f)4), incorporates the sentencing guidelines, the\n\ngovernment bears the burden of proof.                Under the statute, it is a\n\nprerequisite for safety-valve relief that the defendant was not an\n\norganizer, leader, or supervisor of others in the offense \"as\n\ndetermined   under      the     sentencing      guidelines.\"        18   U.S.C.      §\n\n3553(f)(4). Guideline § 5C1.2(a)(4) employs the same language, and\n\nin an application note explains that it \"means a defendant who\n\nreceives an adjustment for an aggravating role under §3B1.1.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. §5C1.1, cmt. (n.5).\n\n           \"The     government      bears      the    burden   of    proving      the\n\nlegitimacy   of   an    upward     role-in-the-offense         adjustment      by    a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.\" United States v. Alicea, 205 F.3d\n\n480, 485 (1st Cir. 2000).        However, \"the burden of proof rests with\n\nthe   [defendant]      to    establish    the   five     criteria    set   out      in\n\nsubsection 3553(f).\"          United States v. Rodriguez-Ortiz, 455 F.3d\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f18, 25 (1st Cir. 2006). Therefore, the cross-reference to U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3B1.1 creates uncertainty about where the burden lies with\n\nrespect to the fourth criterion for safety-valve relief.\n\n            Zayas concedes that \"there was never any objection by the\n\ndefense with respect to the issue of who had the burden of proof as\n\nto the role in the offense.\" Appellant's Brief, 60. Consequently,\n\nplain    error   review   applies.    Given     that   this    court   has   not\n\naddressed the issue, and other circuits faced with the issue have\n\ndeclined to resolve it, see, e.g., United States v. Holguin, 436\n\nF.3d 111, 119 (2d Cir. 2006), the district court's placement of the\n\nburden upon the defendant for safety-valve purposes was not plain\n\nerror.    In all events, the allocation of the burden does not seem\n\nto be a determinative factor in this case.                    For the reasons\n\ndiscussed below, the record evidence amply supported the sentencing\n\ncourt's finding that, more likely than not, Zayas was an organizer,\n\nleader, manager or supervisor.\n\n            IV. Sufficient     Evidence    to    Support      Role-in-Offense\n            Enhancement\n\n            Zayas's final argument is that the evidence, while it\n\nsupports a finding that he was a significant dealer, does not\n\nsupport a finding that he was an \"organizer, leader, manager or\n\nsupervisor of others in the offense,\" as this court's case law has\n\ndefined those guideline terms.\n\n            We review a sentencing court's findings of\n            fact for clear error.     We afford de novo\n            review, however, to questions of law involved\n\n                                     -6-\n\f           in sentencing determinations.      A question\n           about whether the evidence is sufficient to\n           support a particular guideline determination\n           is a question of law and, therefore, engenders\n           de novo review.\n\nUnited States v. Ramos-Paulino, 488 F.3d 459, 463 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nWe have defined the requirements for a two-level role-in-the-\n\noffense enhancement as follows:\n\n           Role-in-the-offense     adjustments    address\n           concerns of relative responsibility. [A two-\n           level increase] is justified if the sentencing\n           court supportably finds that (1) the criminal\n           enterprise involved at least two complicit\n           participants (of whom the defendant may be\n           counted as one), and (2) the defendant, in\n           committing the offense, exercised control\n           over, organized, or was otherwise responsible\n           for superintending the activities of, at least\n           one of those other persons.\n\nUnited States v. Cruz, 120 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997)(en banc).              We\n\nhave emphasized that \"the management of criminal activities (as\n\nopposed to the management of criminal actors) may ground an upward\n\ndeparture but not an upward role-in-the-offense adjustment.\" Ramos-\n\nPaulino, 488 F.3d at 464.\n\n           The   sentencing   court   stated   that   it   \"seems   .   .   .\n\ninconceivable on these facts that Mr. Zayas was not an organizer or\n\nleader.\"   The sentencing court made specific findings that Zayas\n\nwas the \"source\" and \"importer\" of the drugs involved in the\n\noffense; that he intentionally placed some of the drugs in the home\n\nof his codefendant; that other individuals were involved in the\n\noffense conduct, including someone referred to as \"Chino;\" and that\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthe defendant was delivering drugs to \"various people in the\n\nSpringfield area.\"    But the court did not make a specific finding\n\nidentifying one or more persons whom Zayas organized or led.\n\n           Zayas argues that the record does not contain sufficient\n\nevidence to support the finding that he was an organizer, leader,\n\nmanager   or   supervisor   under    U.S.S.G.   §   3B1.1(c).      Where    the\n\ndistrict court \"did not base the enhancement on specific findings\n\nas to whom the defendant may have organized, led, managed, or\n\nsupervised,\" our review includes a \"search[] [of] the record\n\n(including the PSI Report) in an endeavor to identify any such\n\nunderlings.\" Id. at 463.\n\n           The presentence investigation report (PSI Report) states\n\nthat Zayas \"used two or three individuals to sell his crack cocaine\n\non   Allendale   Street.\"     That    fact   is     also    included   in   the\n\ngovernment's recitation at the change-of-plea hearing of the facts\n\nit would prove if the case went to trial.              Zayas indicated his\n\nagreement with the government's version of the facts.                  The PSI\n\nReport recounted two separate incidents in which the cooperating\n\nwitness (CW) contacted Zayas to arrange a drug sale and Chino\n\nprovided the CW with the amount of drugs requested.             Zayas did not\n\nobject to that portion of the PSI Report.            The CW gave testimony\n\nconsistent with the facts contained in the PSI Report at Zayas's\n\ntrial on count 7.      The PSI Report related that the CW saw co-\n\ndefendant Eddie Matos handing cash to Zayas.               From the above, it\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\feasily can be inferred that Chino delivered the drugs to the CW \"at\n\n[Zayas's] express or implied direction.\" United States v. Ofray-\n\nCampos, 534 F.3d 1, 41 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 129 S.Ct. 588\n\n(2008).     To summarize, the evidence in the record is sufficient to\n\nsupport    the     sentencing   court's      two-level   role-in-the-offense\n\nenhancement. See United States v. Jones, 523 F.3d 31, 43 (1st Cir.)\n\n(holding    that    evidence    was   sufficient    to   support   §   3B1.1(c)\n\nenhancement where Jones \"coordinated the actions of a number of\n\ndrug sellers . . . and determined to a considerable extent when and\n\nwhere they would make deliveries\"), cert. denied, 129 S.Ct. 228\n\n(2008); United States v. Soto-Beniquez, 356 F.3d 1, 54(1st Cir.\n\n2003)(upholding two-level enhancement for supervisory role where\n\ndefendant controlled a drug point and had people \"selling for\n\nhim\"); Cruz, 120 F.3d at 4 (holding that defendant's supervision of\n\nanother    person    in   connection    with   a   single   drug   transaction\n\nprovided an adequate basis for § 3B1.1(c) enhancement).\n\n            We need go no further.             The government's motion is\n\ngranted and appellant's conviction and sentence are affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f",

The\n\nCunningham    Court   applied   the   definition   of    statutory   maximum\n\narticulated in Blakely, 542 U.S. at 303-304:\n\n          \"[T]he relevant 'statutory maximum,'\" this\n          Court has clarified, \"is not the maximum\n          sentence a judge may impose after finding\n          additional facts, but the maximum he may\n          impose without any additional findings.\"\n          Blakely, 542 U.S., at 303-304 (emphasis in\n          original).\n\nCunningham, 549 U.S. at 275.\n\n          In Zayas's case, the statutory maximum sentence that he\n\ncould receive based solely upon his guilty plea to counts 1 and 4,\n\nwhich specified drug quantities of fifty or more grams of cocaine\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fbase, was life in prison and the minimum was ten years. See 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(b)(iii).      Therefore, using the definition employed in\n\nCunningham, the relevant \"statutory maximum\" was a life sentence.\n\nClearly, no judicial factfinding resulted in imposition of a\n\nsentence above that level.      To the contrary, judicial factfinding\n\nregarding Zayas's role in the offense resulted in his receiving the\n\nstatutory minimum sentence.\n\n            Before   and   after   Cunningham,   refusal   to   reduce    a\n\nstatutory sentence based on judicial factfinding does not violate\n\nthe Sixth Amendment. Bermudez, 407 F.3d at 545.        There was no error\n\nin the sentencing court's reliance upon judicial factfinding in\n\ndetermining that Zayas was ineligible for safety-valve relief.\n\n            II. Mandatory Application of Safety-Valve Criteria after\n            Booker\n\n            Zayas argues that the district court erred in concluding\n\nthat it did not have the authority to sentence him below the\n\nmandatory minimum sentence because he did not satisfy all the\n\nsafety-valve factors.       He contends that because the safety-valve\n\nrequirements    reference    the   guidelines    and   Booker   made     the\n\nguidelines advisory, then the safety-valve requirements are also\n\nadvisory.    That argument has been rejected by all the courts of\n\nappeals that have considered it.          See, e.g., United States v.\n\nTanner, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1315411\"><a href=\"/opinion/1315411/united-states-v-tanner/\"><span class=\"volume\">544</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">793</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 795 (7th Cir. 2008) (holding that the\n\nsentencing judge \"cannot treat as advisory the guideline provisions\n\nthat are preconditions for safety-valve relief, namely 18 U.S.C. §§\n\n                                    -4-\n\f3553(f)(1) and (4)\"); United States v. McKoy, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794733\"><a href=\"/opinion/794733/united-states-v-ricardo-mckoy/\"><span class=\"volume\">452</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">234</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 240 (3d\n\nCir. 2006) (reasoning that \"[i]nterpreting § 3553(f) as advisory\n\nwould effectively excise that section from the statute,\" and\n\ntherefore would be inconsistent with Booker, which left § 3553(f)\n\nintact).   We agree.        Thus, Zayas has failed to demonstrate that the\n\nsentencing court erred in treating § 3553(f) as mandatory rather\n\nthan advisory.\n\n           III. Allocation of Burden re: Safety-Valve Prerequisites\n\n           Appellant argues that because the statutory provision, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(f)4), incorporates the sentencing guidelines, the\n\ngovernment bears the burden of proof.                Under the statute, it is a\n\nprerequisite for safety-valve relief that the defendant was not an\n\norganizer, leader, or supervisor of others in the offense \"as\n\ndetermined   under      the     sentencing      guidelines.\"        18   U.S.C.      §\n\n3553(f)(4). Guideline § 5C1.2(a)(4) employs the same language, and\n\nin an application note explains that it \"means a defendant who\n\nreceives an adjustment for an aggravating role under §3B1.1.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. §5C1.1, cmt. (n.5).\n\n           \"The     government      bears      the    burden   of    proving      the\n\nlegitimacy   of   an    upward     role-in-the-offense         adjustment      by    a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.\" United States v. Alicea, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198845\"><a href=\"/opinion/198845/united-states-v-rivera-alicea/\"><span class=\"volume\">205</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">480</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 485 (1st Cir. 2000).        However, \"the burden of proof rests with\n\nthe   [defendant]      to    establish    the   five     criteria    set   out      in\n\nsubsection 3553(f).\"          United States v. Rodriguez-Ortiz, 455 F.3d\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\f18, 25 (1st Cir. 2006). Therefore, the cross-reference to U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 3B1.1 creates uncertainty about where the burden lies with\n\nrespect to the fourth criterion for safety-valve relief.\n\n            Zayas concedes that \"there was never any objection by the\n\ndefense with respect to the issue of who had the burden of proof as\n\nto the role in the offense.\" Appellant's Brief, 60. Consequently,\n\nplain    error   review   applies.    Given     that   this    court   has   not\n\naddressed the issue, and other circuits faced with the issue have\n\ndeclined to resolve it, see, e.g., United States v. Holguin, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"793135\"><a href=\"/opinion/793135/united-states-v-arlex-holguin/\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">111</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 119 (2d Cir. 2006), the district court's placement of the\n\nburden upon the defendant for safety-valve purposes was not plain\n\nerror.    In all events, the allocation of the burden does not seem\n\nto be a determinative factor in this case.                    For the reasons\n\ndiscussed below, the record evidence amply supported the sentencing\n\ncourt's finding that, more likely than not, Zayas was an organizer,\n\nleader, manager or supervisor.\n\n            IV. Sufficient     Evidence    to    Support      Role-in-Offense\n            Enhancement\n\n            Zayas's final argument is that the evidence, while it\n\nsupports a finding that he was a significant dealer, does not\n\nsupport a finding that he was an \"organizer, leader, manager or\n\nsupervisor of others in the offense,\" as this court's case law has\n\ndefined those guideline terms.\n\n            We review a sentencing court's findings of\n            fact for clear error.     We afford de novo\n            review, however, to questions of law involved\n\n                                     -6-\n\f           in sentencing determinations.      A question\n           about whether the evidence is sufficient to\n           support a particular guideline determination\n           is a question of law and, therefore, engenders\n           de novo review.\n\nUnited States v. Ramos-Paulino, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202753\"><a href=\"/opinion/202753/united-states-v-ramos-paulino/\"><span class=\"volume\">488</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">459</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 463 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nWe have defined the requirements for a two-level role-in-the-\n\noffense enhancement as follows:\n\n           Role-in-the-offense     adjustments    address\n           concerns of relative responsibility. [A two-\n           level increase] is justified if the sentencing\n           court supportably finds that (1) the criminal\n           enterprise involved at least two complicit\n           participants (of whom the defendant may be\n           counted as one), and (2) the defendant, in\n           committing the offense, exercised control\n           over, organized, or was otherwise responsible\n           for superintending the activities of, at least\n           one of those other persons.\n\nUnited States v. Cruz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"744197\"><a href=\"/opinion/744197/united-states-v-ceferino-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 3 (1st Cir. 1997)(en banc).              We\n\nhave emphasized that \"the management of criminal activities (as\n\nopposed to the management of criminal actors) may ground an upward\n\ndeparture but not an upward role-in-the-offense adjustment.\" Ramos-\n\nPaulino, 488 F.3d at 464.\n\n           The   sentencing   court   stated   that   it   \"seems   .   .   .\n\ninconceivable on these facts that Mr. Zayas was not an organizer or\n\nleader.\"   The sentencing court made specific findings that Zayas\n\nwas the \"source\" and \"importer\" of the drugs involved in the\n\noffense; that he intentionally placed some of the drugs in the home\n\nof his codefendant; that other individuals were involved in the\n\noffense conduct, including someone referred to as \"Chino;\" and that\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthe defendant was delivering drugs to \"various people in the\n\nSpringfield area.\"    But the court did not make a specific finding\n\nidentifying one or more persons whom Zayas organized or led.\n\n           Zayas argues that the record does not contain sufficient\n\nevidence to support the finding that he was an organizer, leader,\n\nmanager   or   supervisor   under    U.S.S.G.   §   3B1.1(c).      Where    the\n\ndistrict court \"did not base the enhancement on specific findings\n\nas to whom the defendant may have organized, led, managed, or\n\nsupervised,\" our review includes a \"search[] [of] the record\n\n(including the PSI Report) in an endeavor to identify any such\n\nunderlings.\" Id. at 463.\n\n           The presentence investigation report (PSI Report) states\n\nthat Zayas \"used two or three individuals to sell his crack cocaine\n\non   Allendale   Street.\"     That    fact   is     also    included   in   the\n\ngovernment's recitation at the change-of-plea hearing of the facts\n\nit would prove if the case went to trial.              Zayas indicated his\n\nagreement with the government's version of the facts.                  The PSI\n\nReport recounted two separate incidents in which the cooperating\n\nwitness (CW) contacted Zayas to arrange a drug sale and Chino\n\nprovided the CW with the amount of drugs requested.             Zayas did not\n\nobject to that portion of the PSI Report.            The CW gave testimony\n\nconsistent with the facts contained in the PSI Report at Zayas's\n\ntrial on count 7.      The PSI Report related that the CW saw co-\n\ndefendant Eddie Matos handing cash to Zayas.               From the above, it\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\feasily can be inferred that Chino delivered the drugs to the CW \"at\n\n[Zayas's] express or implied direction.\" United States v.
