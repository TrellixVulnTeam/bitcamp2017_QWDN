R. 32.3\n\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                        For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 02-1872\n\n                          MICHAEL E. JAQUES,\n                         Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                       v.\n\n                    TOWN OF LONDONDERRY ET AL.,\n                       Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\n         [Hon. Steven J. McAuliffe, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n                         Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                  Farris,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                     and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Andru H. Volinsky, with whom Stein, Volinsky & Callaghan P.A.\nwas on brief, for appellant.\n     Donald E. Gardner, with whom Michael A. Ricker and Devine,\nMillimet & Branch, P.A. were on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                            December 20, 2002\n\n\n\n_________\n*Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f             Per Curiam. The case underlying this appeal arose out of\n\nan unfortunate incident that occurred during the early morning\n\nhours of September 16, 1997.        At that time, police responded to a\n\n911   call    at   a   residence   located    at   17   Windsor   Boulevard,\n\nLondonderry, New Hampshire.        They patiently attempted to take into\n\ncustody, and disarm, plaintiff-appellant Michael E. Jaques. As the\n\ndrama played out, gunfire erupted.         Jaques was severely wounded by\n\na shot fired by Sgt. Gerard Dussault.\n\n             In the aftermath of the shooting, Jaques invoked 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 and brought a federal civil rights suit against the\n\nTown of Londonderry (the Town) and several Londonderry police\n\nofficers (including Sgt. Dussault, Chief Joseph Ryan, Officer Chris\n\nGandia, and Officer Jack Slade).1            He alleged, inter alia, that\n\nSgt. Dussault had used excessive force against him; that Chief Ryan\n\nand the Town had instituted a series of wrong-headed customs,\n\npolicies, and practices; and, to make matters worse, that they had\n\ninadequately trained the Town's police officers.\n\n             After protracted pretrial discovery, the district court\n\ngranted the defendants' motion for summary judgment. See Jaques v.\n\nTown of Londonderry, No. 00-432, 2002 WL 1332491 (D.N.H. June 17,\n\n2002).    This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      On appeal, Jaques pursues only his excessive force claim\nagainst Sgt. Dussault and his municipal liability claims against\nthe Town and Chief Ryan.\n\n                                     -2-\n\f              There is no need to tarry.              The district court wrote a\n\nlengthy, closely reasoned opinion addressing, and fully disposing\n\nof, the appellant's claims.                Having carefully considered the\n\nrecord, the briefs, the appellant's assignments of error, and the\n\nparties' arguments, we conclude, without serious question, that the\n\ndistrict court's       disposition        of    the    case    was   correct   in   all\n\nrespects.\n\n              We have made it an article of faith \"that when a lower\n\ncourt accurately takes the measure of a case and articulates a\n\ncogent rationale, it serves no useful purpose for a reviewing court\n\nto write at length.\"          Seaco Ins. Co. v. Davis-Irish, 300 F.3d 84,\n\n86 (1st Cir. 2002); accord Maurice v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.\n\nCo., 235 F.3d 7, 9-10 (1st Cir. 2000); Chico-Velez v. Roche Prods.,\n\nInc.,   139    F.3d    56,    58   (1st   Cir.        1998);   Ayala   v.   Union   de\n\nTronquistas de P.R., 74 F.3d 344, 345 (1st Cir. 1996); Holder's\n\nCapital Corp. v. Cal. Union Ins. Co. (In re San Juan Dupont Plaza\n\nHotel Fire Litig.), 989 F.2d 36, 38 (1st Cir. 1993).                        This is a\n\nparadigmatic example of the sort of case in which that principle\n\nshould be applied.           Consequently, we affirm the district court's\n\njudgment for substantially the reasons elucidated in that court's\n\nthoughtful rescript.          We add only four brief comments.\n\n              First:   The appellant asseverates that summary judgment\n\nwas barred by a plethora of factual disputes.                          He overlooks,\n\nhowever, that the mere presence of genuinely disputed facts does\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fnot pretermit summary judgment.        \"To achieve that end, the dispute\n\nmust relate to a material fact.\"        Kearney v. Town of Wareham, ___\n\nF.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2002) (emphasis in the original) [No. 02-\n\n1264, slip op. at 10].        A fact is material if — and only if — it\n\nhas the capacity to affect the outcome of the case.           United States\n\nv. One Parcel of Real Prop. (Great Harbor Neck, New Shoreham,\n\nR.I.), 960 F.2d 200, 204 (1st Cir. 1992).           The disputes to which\n\nthe appellant alludes are about facts that are not critical to the\n\nproper adjudication of the summary judgment motion (and which,\n\ntherefore, are not material).\n\n            Second:   As a result of his actions on the morning in\n\nquestion,   the   appellant    pled   guilty   to   a   criminal   charge   of\n\nreckless conduct.      See N.H. Rev. Stat. § 631:3.                Under New\n\nHampshire law, see, e.g., Hopps v. Utica Mut. Ins. Co., 127 N.H.\n\n508, 511, 514 (1985), that plea admitted the material allegations\n\ncontained in the indictment.      Thus, the correct starting point for\n\nanalysis of the defendants' summary judgment motion was to take, as\n\na given, that the appellant \"recklessly engaged in conduct which\n\nplaced another in danger of serious bodily injury.\"                   In the\n\ncircumstances at hand, that admission was damning.            See Napier v.\n\nTown of Windham, 187 F.3d 177, 184-85 (1st Cir. 1999).2\n\n\n     2\n      We find unpersuasive the appellant's effort to distinguish\nNapier on the ground that, here, the admission did not encompass an\nimminent threat of harm. While not an element of the offense to\nwhich he pled guilty, the imminence of the threat posed by the\nappellant's conduct is an inescapable inference from the undisputed\n\n                                      -4-\n\f           Third:   There is no question here that the appellant,\n\nknown to Sgt. Dussault to be a former Army Ranger, steadily\n\nadvanced on Sgt. Dussault; that he was armed; that he refused to\n\nobey the officer's orders; that the officer retreated; that the\n\nappellant fired the first shot; and that another officer (later\n\nidentified as Gandia) returned fire.        Only then did Sgt. Dussault,\n\nbelieving that a comrade was under attack and that he himself was\n\nin jeopardy, discharge his weapon.           Given the compressed time\n\nframe,   the   highly   charged   environment,        and   the   kaleidoscopic\n\nsequence of events, a rational jury could not find that Sgt.\n\nDussault's return of fire was objectively unreasonable. See Graham\n\nv. Connor, 490 U.S. 386, 396-97 (1989) (explaining that \"[t]he\n\ncalculus of reasonableness must embody allowance for the fact that\n\npolice officers are often forced to make split-second judgments —\n\nin circumstances that are tense, uncertain, and rapidly evolving —\n\nabout the amount of force that is necessary in a particular\n\nsituation\");    accord Napier,     187    F.3d   at    184-85,    187;   Roy   v.\n\nInhabitants of City of Lewiston, 42 F.3d 691, 695 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n           Fourth: We say only a few words about the claims against\n\nChief Ryan and the Town.      The bottom line is that the failure of\n\nthe appellant's cause of action against Dussault dooms his attempt\n\nto impose liability on Chief Ryan and the Town.                     Without an\n\nunderlying constitutional violation — and if Dussault is not\n\n\nfacts of record.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fliable, there is no such violation here — a claim of municipal\n\nliability necessarily fails. See Nieves v. McSweeney, 241 F.3d 46,\n\n50 (1st Cir. 2001); Evans v. Avery, 100 F.3d 1033, 1040 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n            We need go no further.      We hold that the district court\n\ndid   not   err   in   granting   the   defendants'   motion   for   brevis\n\ndisposition.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f",
