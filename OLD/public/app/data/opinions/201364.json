R. 32.3\n\n          United States Court of Appeals\n                          For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 03-2663\n\n                             BRIAN TAMBORELLI,\n\n                           Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                        v.\n\n              SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND SCHOOL OF LAW, ET AL.,\n\n                          Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n               [Hon. Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                     Before\n\n                          Selya, Lynch and Lipez,\n                              Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     Brian D. Tamborelli on brief pro se.\n     Allen N. David, Elizabeth A. Houlding and Peabody & Arnold\nLLP, on brief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                              December 3, 2004\n\f          Per Curiam.         Brian Tamborelli has appealed the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of his complaint, in which he contends that\n\nSouthern New England School of Law (SNESL) and several of its\n\nofficers solicited his attendance and tuition money by, inter alia,\n\nfraudulently misrepresenting the status of its ability to obtain\n\ncertification by the American Bar Association (ABA).                    We have\n\nreviewed the parties' briefs and the record on appeal.                We affirm.\n\n          We    have    recently      considered    substantially     identical\n\nactions filed by other SNESL graduates.             See Rodi v. S. New Engl.\n\nSch. of Law, ___ F.3d ___ (1st Cir. 2004) [2004 WL 2537204];\n\nJolicoeur v. S. New Engl. Sch. of Law, 104 Fed. Appx. 745 (1st Cir.\n\n2004) (per curiam).          Tamborelli's action suffered from the same\n\ndefect as Jolicoeur's: it was not timely commenced.               By no later\n\nthan December 1999, Tamborelli knew that any statements regarding\n\nthe imminent likelihood of ABA certification were false.                By that\n\ntime,   the    ABA     had    twice    denied     SNESL's   application        for\n\naccreditation and, in derogation of a promise Tamborelli alleges\n\nwas made, SNESL had failed to appeal that denial. Tamborelli makes\n\nno cogent argument for any later accrual date.                   Tamborelli's\n\naction, filed in July of 2003, was, therefore, barred by the three-\n\nyear statute    of     limitations.      Unlike     the   complaint    filed    by\n\nplaintiff Rodi, the timeliness of Tamborelli's federal complaint is\n\nnot redeemed by any savings statute.            Cf. Rodi v. S. New Engl. Sch.\n\nof Law, ___ F.3d at ___ [2004 WL 2537204, at *10].\n\n                                       -2-\n\f          We reject Tamborelli's criticism that the district court\n\ndid not allow him to amend his complaint.    For one thing he never\n\nsought to amend his complaint in the district court.    For another\n\nthing, nothing he has stated in his appellate briefing suggests\n\nthat he could successfully overcome the time bar.       Indeed, his\n\nreply brief expresses his own contradictory views on whether any\n\namendment would be futile.\n\n          Finally, we find no abuse of discretion in the district\n\ncourt's failure to recuse itself.    See United States v. Ayala, 289\n\nF.3d 16, 27 (1st Cir. 2002) (limning the standard of review).\n\n          We need go no further. For the reasons stated, the order\n\nof dismissal is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f",
