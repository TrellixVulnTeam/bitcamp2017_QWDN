Héctor M. Laffitte, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                    Torruella, Selya and Lipez,\n\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Stephen J.

This appeal requires us to decide,\n\nfor   the   first    time,   what    requirements    must   be   met   when   a\n\nprobationer, parolee, or person on supervised release purposes to\n\nwaive his right to a revocation hearing under Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 32.1.1         We conclude that the record must show,\n\naffirmatively or by fair implication, that any such waiver was\n\nknowingly and voluntarily made.           Because the record in the instant\n\ncase reflects no such showing, we vacate the appellant's sentence\n\nand remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion\n\n(including   an     opportunity     for   the   appellant   to   withdraw   his\n\nattorney's concession that a sufficient factual basis existed to\n\njustify the revocation of his term of supervised release).\n\nI.    BACKGROUND\n\n            On July 9, 1993, defendant-appellant Jorge L. Correa-\n\nTorres pleaded guilty to one count of possessing more than five\n\nkilograms of cocaine with intent to distribute and aiding and\n\nabetting in the commission of that offense.                 See 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. § 2.           The district court sentenced him to\n\neighty months in prison, to be followed by a five-year term of\n\nsupervised release.      The appellant was discharged from the federal\n\n\n\n      1\n      While this appeal was pending, the Criminal Rules were\nrevised.   The section at issue here, formerly Fed. R. Crim. P.\n32.1(a)(2) (2000), now appears, without any relevant modification,\nas Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1(b)(2) (2003). For convenience, we refer\nthroughout to the earlier edition (which was in force at the time\nof the appellant's revocation hearing).\n\n                                      -2-\n\fpenitentiary in 1998, and his term of supervised release commenced\n\nat that time.\n\n           Two years later — while the appellant was still under\n\nsupervision — the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico charged him with\n\nbeating and threatening his girlfriend and damaging her car.                  See\n\n8 P.R. Laws Ann. §§ 632, 633.              Although these charges were\n\neventually dropped because the girlfriend refused to cooperate with\n\nthe local authorities, the incident continued to dog the appellant:\n\nthe terms of his supervised release prohibited him from committing\n\nany   federal,   state,   or   local   crime,     and   the   domestic    abuse\n\nallegations, if proven, constituted a clear violation.                   See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3583(d).    So long as the government could prove that the\n\nappellant committed the proscribed acts, the terms of his release\n\nwould be violated even in the absence of an actual conviction.                See\n\nUnited States v. Jolibois, 294 F.3d 1110, 1114 (9th Cir. 2002); see\n\nalso USSG §7B1.1, cmt. (n.1).\n\n           The appellant's probation officer brought the underlying\n\nfacts to the district court's attention and moved for an order\n\nrequiring the appellant to show cause why his term of supervised\n\nrelease should not be revoked. The district court issued the show-\n\ncause   order.    That    order,   along   with    a    notification     of   the\n\nappellant's procedural rights, was served upon the attorney who had\n\nrepresented the appellant at the original trial.              Both documents\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fwere   written    in   English,   and    neither   contained   a   Spanish\n\ntranslation.\n\n            At the revocation hearing, the appellant's counsel — the\n\nsame lawyer upon whom the show-cause order had been served —\n\ninformed the court that, based on his (counsel's) conversations\n\nwith the appellant's girlfriend, the appellant would not contest\n\nthe charge.      The lawyer then asked the court to be as lenient as\n\npossible, emphasizing that the local court had dismissed the\n\ndomestic violence complaint and that the appellant had an otherwise\n\nuntarnished record during supervised release.         The district court\n\ndid not inquire of the appellant either as to his understanding of\n\nhis rights or as to his guilt.          In fact, the appellant did not\n\nspeak at all throughout most of the proceeding, but, instead,\n\nrelied upon a court-appointed interpreter to follow the ongoing\n\ndialogue.\n\n            The district court correctly explained that the absence\n\nof a conviction was beside the point; revocation of supervised\n\nrelease could be ordered as long as the appellant had committed a\n\nproscribed act.        Relying upon the waiver — the fact that the\n\nappellant, through counsel, had declined to contest the probation\n\nofficer's allegations — the court revoked the term of supervised\n\nrelease.\n\n            The court then proceeded to the imposition of sentence.\n\nAsked if he wished to say anything in mitigation of punishment, the\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fappellant stated cryptically:       \"I think that it is unfair because\n\nthat was a problem with my former girlfriend.\"         The court did not\n\nask him to elaborate.       The prosecutor then suggested a sentence at\n\nthe nadir of the applicable guidelines range, see USSG §§4B1.2(a),\n\n7B1.1(a), 7B1.4, surmising \"that the defendant [apparently] has\n\naccepted the fact that he abused his girlfriend and threatened her,\n\nand also threatened to kill her, and damaged her vehicle.\"               The\n\ncourt imposed the recommended two-year sentence and added a new\n\nthree-year term of supervised release.\n\n            The appellant filed a pro se notice of appeal.                We\n\nappointed   counsel   for    him.   The   attorney   who   represents    the\n\nappellant in this court is not the attorney who represented him\n\nbelow.\n\nII.   APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n            The   government    challenges   our   jurisdiction   in    this\n\nmatter.     It points out that the district court's judgment was\n\nentered on November 27, 2000, but that the notice of appeal was not\n\ndocketed until late December.          On this basis, the government\n\ninsists that the appellant failed to comply with Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(b)(1)(A), which requires a defendant in a criminal case to file\n\na notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment.\n\nSee United States v. Podolsky, 158 F.3d 12, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1998);\n\nsee also United States v. Morillo, 8 F.3d 864, 867 (1st Cir. 1993)\n\n(explaining that the time limits for taking appeals in criminal\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fcases are \"mandatory and jurisdictional\").                This argument lacks\n\nforce.\n\n              By the time that the district court judgment was entered\n\non the docket, the appellant was in custody.              Under Fed. R. App. P.\n\n4(c)(1), an inmate confined in a correctional institution may file\n\na notice of appeal in a criminal case by depositing it in the\n\ninstitution's internal mail system on or before the last day for\n\nfiling.       The record indicates that the appellant deposited his\n\nnotice of appeal in the prison's internal mail system on December\n\n4, 2000.2      That was less than ten days after the hearing.\n\n              That ends this aspect of the matter.                 Applying the\n\n\"prison mailbox\" rule, we hold that the appellant essayed a timely\n\nappeal.       Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction to hear and\n\ndetermine it.\n\nIII.       ANALYSIS\n\n               Before us, the appellant advances only a single claim:\n\nthat his waiver of rights was insufficiently informed (and, thus,\n\nimpuissant).          To   address   this   claim,   we   must   consider   three\n\ndiscrete but related points. The first implicates the showing that\n\nmust attend a waiver of Rule 32.1 rights.             The second involves the\n\nvalidity of the waiver effected in this case.               The third concerns\n\nthe remedy associated with an invalid waiver.\n\n\n\n       2\n      Although the proof on this point is circumstantial, the\ngovernment does not contest the date of deposit.\n\n                                        -6-\n\f                 A.   Waivers of Rule 32.1 Rights.\n\n          Although revocations of probation, parole, or supervised\n\nrelease are not considered part of a criminal prosecution, they\n\nnevertheless entail a loss of freedom and a deprivation of liberty.\n\nSee Gagnon v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778, 782 (1973); Morrissey v.\n\nBrewer, 408 U.S. 471, 484 n.12 (1972).       Fundamental fairness\n\ntherefore requires that defendants facing such revocations should\n\nbe afforded notice of the charges against them, an opportunity to\n\nconfront their accusers, and a chance to present evidence to their\n\nown behoof.   See Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660, 669 & n.10\n\n(1983).   Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1 addresses this\n\nneed.\n\n          When the revocation of a term of probation, parole, or\n\nsupervised release hangs in the balance, the target is entitled to\n\na panoply of procedural rights.   These include:\n\n          (A) written notice of the alleged violation;\n          (B) disclosure of the evidence against the\n          person; (C) an opportunity to appear and to\n          present evidence in the person's own behalf;\n          (D) the opportunity to question adverse\n          witnesses; and (E) notice of the person's\n          right to be represented by counsel.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 32.1(a)(2) (2000).     These protections serve a\n\nvariety of interests.     Among other things, they safeguard the\n\ndefendant's obvious stake in preserving his liberty.    See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Stocks, 104 F.3d 308, 312 (9th Cir. 1997).   They\n\nalso serve the sovereign's more nuanced interest in ensuring that\n\n\n                                -7-\n\fimportant legal determinations are informed by an accurate account\n\nof verified facts.    See, e.g., Black v. Romano, 471 U.S. 606, 612\n\n(1985); Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 484.\n\n          In our system of criminal justice, most rights can be\n\nwaived.   See United States v. Teeter, 257 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir.\n\n2001) (cataloguing examples).         The rights enumerated in Rule 32.1\n\nare no exception. As a general proposition, however, the waiver of\n\nvirtually any right closely affecting individual liberty must be\n\nknowingly and voluntarily made. See, e.g., Brady v. United States,\n\n397 U.S. 742, 748 (1970) (discussing waiver of rights incident to\n\nguilty plea); Adams v. United States, 317 U.S. 269, 275 (1942)\n\n(discussing waiver of right to jury trial); Johnson v. Zerbst, 304\n\nU.S. 458, 464 (1938) (discussing waiver of right to counsel);\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d at 24 (discussing waiver of right to appeal).\n\nBecause adherence to the processes prescribed by Rule 32.1 is\n\ninstrumental to the fair and efficient operation of revocation\n\nproceedings,   we   hold   that   a   waiver   of   the   rights   conferred\n\nthereunder cannot be effective unless that waiver is made both\n\nknowingly and voluntarily.        Accord United States v. LeBlanc, 175\n\nF.3d 511, 515 (7th Cir. 1999); United States v. Pelensky, 129 F.3d\n\n63, 68 n.9 (2d Cir. 1997); Stocks, 104 F.3d at 312.\n\n          Ideally, the district court, when confronted with an\n\nattempted waiver, will advise the probationer, parolee, or person\n\non supervised release of both the rights afforded him by Rule 32.1\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fand the consequences of a relinquishment of those rights.        Because\n\nwe are mindful that revocation proceedings are more informal than\n\ncriminal prosecutions, see Morrissey, 408 U.S. at 480; United\n\nStates v. Jones, 299 F.3d 103, 110 (2d Cir. 2002); United States v.\n\nMiller, 797 F.2d 336, 340 (6th Cir. 1986), we do not prescribe any\n\nparticular mantra.       Instead, we emulate several of our sister\n\ncircuits   and   hold   that,   notwithstanding   the   requirement   that\n\nwaivers of procedural rights with respect to revocation hearings\n\nmust be knowing and voluntary, such waivers need not be accompanied\n\neither by any magic words or by a formal colloquy of the depth and\n\nintensity required under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11\n\n(governing guilty pleas in criminal cases).       See LeBlanc, 175 F.3d\n\nat 515-16; Pelensky, 129 F.3d at 67-68 (collecting cases); United\n\nStates v. Rapert, 813 F.2d 182, 184-85 (8th Cir. 1987); cf. United\n\nStates v. Proctor, 166 F.3d 396, 401 & n.5 (1st Cir. 1999) (noting\n\nthat waivers of some rights must be scrutinized more closely than\n\nothers).\n\n           This protocol has real significance for purposes of\n\nappellate review.       Where, as here, a probationer, parolee, or\n\nperson on supervised release mounts a retrospective challenge to\n\nthe validity of a waiver of Rule 32.1 rights, a reviewing court\n\nshould look not only to the punctilio of the sentencing court's\n\ncolloquy with the probationer, parolee, or person on supervised\n\nrelease, but also to the totality of the attendant circumstances.\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fSee LeBlanc, 175 F.3d at 517; United States v. Green, 168 F. Supp.\n\n2d 383, 385 (E.D. Pa. 2001); cf. United States v. Woodard, 291 F.3d\n\n95, 109 (1st Cir. 2002) (applying this mode of examination to\n\nwaivers of the right to counsel); Smart v. Gillette Co. Long-Term\n\nDisab. Plan, 70 F.3d 173, 181 (1st Cir. 1995) (applying this mode\n\nof examination to waivers of employment rights).\n\n              The totality of the circumstances means exactly that —\n\nall     the   circumstances    should     be   considered.     Still,      some\n\ncircumstances are likely to have particular relevance in the\n\nrevocation hearing context.          These include evidence that sheds\n\nlight upon the target's comprehension of the charges against him\n\nand evidence as to his appreciation of the nature of the rights\n\nafforded him by Rule 32.1.        In the final analysis, however, courts\n\nshould beware of assigning talismanic significance to any single\n\nfact or circumstance.          The question of waiver entails endless\n\npermutations, and each case is quite likely to be sui generis.\n\n                          B.   The Instant Waiver.\n\n              Against this backdrop, we turn to the proceedings in this\n\ncase.     We find no evidentiary support for the government's ipse\n\ndixit that the appellant understood either his rights or the\n\nsignificance of his waiver.\n\n              We begin this phase of our discussion by observing that\n\nthe   district    court   never    made   a    specific   finding   that   the\n\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fappellant's waiver was knowing and voluntary.3        While such an\n\nexpress finding is not ordinarily required in connection with a\n\nwaiver of rights, see United States v. Segal, 549 F.2d 1293, 1300-\n\n01 (9th Cir. 1977), it is infinitely more difficult to find a valid\n\nwaiver based on a silent record.     Cf. Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S.\n\n238, 243 (1969) (refusing to draw such an inference in the guilty\n\nplea context).\n\n          Apart from the absence of a specific finding, nothing in\n\nthe record adequately evinces that the appellant understood the\n\nnature of the accusation that triggered the revocation proceeding.\n\nThe charges lodged against him in the Puerto Rico courts were\n\ndismissed, and the facts underlying those charges were never\n\nclearly set forth in the federal court proceedings.    The exchanges\n\nbetween the court and defense counsel at the revocation hearing\n\nitself did little to clarify matters, nor did they establish with\n\nany precision the appellant's version of the underlying events.\n\nThe appellant said very little over the course of the hearing, and\n\nwhat little he did say, quoted supra, suggests a belief that he may\n\nnot have committed a crime at all.    At the very least, his cryptic\n\ncomment may have indicated a failure to appreciate the nature of\n\nthe charges lodged against him.    See, e.g., LeBlanc, 175 F.3d at\n\n515-17 (finding that a \"confused colloquy with the court\" evidenced\n\n\n\n     3\n      Given the fact that we announce a new rule, we do not intend\nany criticism of the able district judge.\n\n                               -11-\n\fthe defendant's failure to comprehend the charges). We do not know\n\nbecause that comment was left unexplored.\n\n           By like token, there is no reason to believe that the\n\nappellant knew his rights.        After all, the record does not reflect\n\neither that the court advised the appellant of his rights or that\n\ncounsel reviewed those rights with him.4            One cannot knowingly\n\nwaive rights if one does not realize that they exist.                In the\n\ncircumstances of this case, an affirmative showing that someone had\n\nadvised the appellant of his Rule 32.1 rights and explained the\n\neffect of a decision not to exercise those rights would seem to be\n\na necessary concomitant to finding a knowing waiver.\n\n           This is a critical point.         It not only goes to whether\n\nthe appellant knew that he could put the government to its proof\n\n(i.e., require meaningful disclosure of the evidence against him\n\nand the opportunity to cross-examine the government's witnesses)\n\nbut also to whether he knew that he was entitled to offer evidence\n\nin his own behalf (including evidence in mitigation). Presentation\n\nof mitigation evidence is \"[a] further and equally important step\n\n[]   necessary   to   determine    whether   such   a   violation   warrants\n\nrevocation and, if so, what sentence shall be imposed.\"               United\n\n\n\n      4\n      To be sure, the show-cause order was accompanied by a notice\nof rights — but those papers were served not on the appellant but\non his counsel.    The record is devoid of any evidence that the\nlawyer reviewed the \"notice of rights\" document with the appellant.\nMoreover, the document was in English — a language in which the\nappellant is not conversant.\n\n                                    -12-\n\fStates v. Diaz-Burgos, 601 F.2d 983, 985 (9th Cir. 1979) (per\n\ncuriam).    Given the unsettled state of the predicate facts, a\n\nsimple   allocution   by   an   untutored   defendant   hardly   seems   an\n\nadequate surrogate for this right. See United States v. Dodson, 25\n\nF.3d 385, 388-90 (6th Cir. 1994) (observing that \"the unskilled or\n\nuneducated probationer or parolee may well have difficulty in\n\npresenting his version of a disputed set of facts\").\n\n           Last — but far from least — the stakes often reflect upon\n\nwhether a waiver can be deemed knowing and voluntary.        See Town of\n\nNewton v. Rumery, 480 U.S. 386, 394 (1987) (considering the gain\n\nfrom a waiver in determining whether it was knowing and voluntary);\n\nMelanson v. Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc., 281 F.3d 272, 278 (1st\n\nCir. 2002) (same).     In this instance, the appellant had much to\n\ngain and little to lose by reserving his Rule 32.1 rights instead\n\nof waiving them.   On the one hand, had he exercised his rights, the\n\nappellant might have successfully refuted the allegations against\n\nhim, or, in the alternative, might have adduced evidence tending to\n\nmitigate the severity of the asserted violation.         See Gagnon, 411\n\nU.S. at 786-87; Diaz-Burgos, 601 F.2d at 985-86.          Either way, he\n\nmight have prevented (or, at least, minimized) the loss of his\n\nliberty.   Waiving his rights, on the other hand, yielded him no\n\ndiscernible benefit.\n\n           To sum up, we recognize that courts generally give\n\ndefendants the opportunity to waive various of their rights in\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\forder to expedite criminal proceedings and bring finality to them.\n\nWaivers are not, however, intended \"to leave acquiescent defendants\n\ntotally exposed to future vagaries (however harsh, unfair, or\n\nunforeseeable).\"    Teeter, 257 F.3d at 25.         In this case, there is\n\nsimply no    evidence   to   show   that    the   appellant   knowingly    and\n\nvoluntarily placed himself at risk of such vagaries.5            His waiver\n\nwas, therefore, ineffectual.\n\n                               C.    Remedy.\n\n            We briefly discuss the question of remedy.          When a term\n\nof probation, parole, or supervised release is revoked following an\n\ninvalid waiver of Rule 32.1 rights, the preferred practice is to\n\nvacate the ensuing sentence and start the proceeding afresh.               See\n\nLeBlanc, 175 F.3d at 518; see also Dodson, 25 F.3d at 390 (vacating\n\npost-revocation    sentence   when    probationer     was   prohibited    from\n\ntestifying on his own behalf).              This accords with the praxis\n\ntypically followed in the wake of a Rule 11 violation.           See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Abbott, 241 F.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir. 2001); United\n\nStates v. Hernandez-Wilson, 186 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1999); but\n\ncf. United States v. Giron-Reyes, 234 F.3d 78, 83 (1st Cir. 2000)\n\n\n     5\n      Subsequent to oral argument in this case, we received an\ninformative motion from the government that transmitted a letter\nover the signature of the appellant's trial counsel purporting to\nrecount his version of events leading up to the waiver. We deem\nthat submission improper and therefore disregard it. See United\nStates v. Kobrosky, 711 F.2d 449, 457 (1st Cir. 1983) (\"We are an\nappellate tribunal, not a nisi prius court; evidentiary matters not\nfirst presented to the district court are, as the greenest of\ncounsel should know, not properly before us.\").\n\n                                     -14-\n\f(vacating sentence but allowing lower court to reinstate it if a\n\n\"meaningful retrospective hearing\" could determine that defendant's\n\nguilty plea was competent).\n\n           In this case, we see no reason to deviate from the norm.\n\nThus, we direct the vacatur of the appellant's sentence.               On\n\nremand, the district court should allow the appellant, if he so\n\nelects, to withdraw his prior stipulation and contest the stated\n\nbasis for revocation of supervised release.         The court shall then\n\nundertake further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\nIV.   CONCLUSION\n\n           We need go no further. We adopt today a rule to the\n\neffect that, if a person facing a proceeding for revocation of\n\nprobation, parole, or supervised release purposes to waive his\n\nrights under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1, the district\n\ncourt has an obligation to ensure that the waiver is made knowingly\n\nand voluntarily.     The waiver here fails to satisfy that criterion.\n\nConsequently,   we    sustain   the   defendant's   appeal,   vacate   his\n\nsentence, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\nVacated and remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\f",

Because the record in the instant case reflects no such showing, we vacate the appellant's sentence and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion (including an opportunity for the appellant to withdraw his attorney's concession that a sufficient factual basis existed to justify the revocation of his term of supervised release).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 9, 1993, defendant-appellant Jorge L. Correa-Torres pleaded guilty to one count of possessing more than five kilograms of cocaine with intent to distribute and aiding and abetting in the commission of that offense. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. The district court sentenced him to eighty months in prison, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release. The appellant was discharged from the federal penitentiary in 1998, and his term of supervised release commenced at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two years later &#8212; while the appellant was still under supervision &#8212; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico charged him with beating and threatening his girlfriend and damaging her car. <i>See</i> 8 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 632, 633. Although these charges were eventually dropped because the girlfriend refused to cooperate with the local authorities, the incident continued to dog the appellant: the terms of his supervised release prohibited him from committing any federal, state, or local crime, and the domestic abuse allegations, if proven, constituted a clear violation. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d). So long as the government could prove that the appellant committed the proscribed acts, the terms of his release would be violated even in the absence of an actual conviction. <i>See United States v. Jolibois,</i> 294 F.3d 1110, 1114 (9th Cir. 2002); <i>see also</i> USSG &#167; 7B1.1, cmt. (n. 1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's probation officer brought the underlying facts to the district court's attention and moved for an order requiring the appellant to show cause why his term of supervised release should not be revoked. The district court issued the show-cause order. That order, along with a notification of the appellant's procedural rights, was served upon the attorney who had represented the appellant at the original trial. Both documents were written in English, and neither contained a Spanish translation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the revocation hearing, the appellant's counsel &#8212; the same lawyer upon whom the show-cause order had been served &#8212; informed the court that, based on his (counsel's) conversations with the appellant's girlfriend, the appellant would not contest the charge. The lawyer then asked the court to be as lenient as possible, emphasizing that the local court had dismissed the domestic violence complaint and that the appellant had an otherwise untarnished record during supervised release. The district court did not inquire of the appellant either as to his understanding of his rights or as to his guilt. In fact, the appellant did not speak at all throughout most of the proceeding, but, instead, relied upon a court-appointed interpreter to follow the ongoing dialogue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly explained that the absence of a conviction was beside the point; revocation of supervised release could be ordered as long as the appellant had committed a proscribed act. Relying upon the waiver &#8212; the fact that the appellant, through counsel, had declined to contest the probation officer's allegations &#8212; the court revoked the term of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then proceeded to the imposition of sentence. Asked if he wished to say anything in mitigation of punishment, the appellant stated cryptically: \"I think that it is unfair because that was a problem with my former girlfriend.\" The court did not ask him to elaborate. The prosecutor then suggested a sentence at the nadir of the applicable guidelines range, <i>see</i> USSG &#167;&#167; 4B1.2(a), 7B1.1(a), 7B1.4, surmising \"that the defendant [apparently] has accepted the fact that he abused his girlfriend and threatened her, and also threatened to kill her, and damaged her vehicle.\" The court imposed the recommended two-year sentence and added a new three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant filed a pro se notice of appeal. We appointed counsel for him. The attorney who represents the appellant in this court is not the attorney who represented him below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government challenges our jurisdiction in this matter. It points out that the district court's judgment was entered on November 27, 2000, but that the notice of appeal was not docketed until late December. On this basis, the government insists that the appellant failed to comply with Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A), which requires a defendant in a criminal case to file a notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. <i>See United States v. Podolsky,</i> 158 F.3d 12, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1998); <i>see also United States v. Morillo,</i> 8 F.3d 864, 867 (1st Cir.1993) (explaining that the time limits for taking appeals in criminal cases are \"mandatory and jurisdictional\"). This argument lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the time that the district court judgment was entered on the docket, the appellant was in custody. Under Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1), an inmate confined in a correctional institution may file a notice of appeal in a criminal case by depositing it in the institution's internal mail system on or before the last day for filing. The record indicates that the appellant deposited his notice of appeal in the prison's internal mail system on December 4, 2000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> That was less than ten days after the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. Applying the \"prison mailbox\" rule, we hold that the appellant essayed a timely appeal. Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction to hear and determine it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, the appellant advances only a single claim: that his waiver of rights was insufficiently informed (and, thus, impuissant). To address this claim, we must consider three discrete but related points. The first implicates the showing that must attend a waiver of Rule 32.1 rights. The second involves the validity of the waiver effected in this case. The third concerns the remedy associated with an invalid waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Waivers of Rule 32.1 Rights.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although revocations of probation, parole, or supervised release are not considered part of a criminal prosecution, they nevertheless entail a loss of freedom and a deprivation of liberty. <i>See Gagnon v. Scarpelli,</i> 411 U.S. 778, 782, 93 S.Ct. 1756, 36 L.Ed.2d 656 (1973); <i>Morrissey v. Brewer,</i> 408 U.S. 471, 484 n. 12, 92 S.Ct. 2593, 33 L.Ed.2d 484 (1972). Fundamental fairness therefore requires that defendants facing such revocations should be afforded notice of the charges against them, an opportunity to confront their accusers, and a chance to present evidence to their own behoof. <i>See Bearden v. Georgia,</i> 461 U.S. 660, 669 &amp; n. 10, 103 S.Ct. 2064, 76 L.Ed.2d 221 (1983). Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1 addresses this need.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When the revocation of a term of probation, parole, or supervised release hangs in the balance, the target is entitled to a panoply of procedural rights. These include:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) written notice of the alleged violation; (B) disclosure of the evidence against the person; (C) an opportunity to appear and to present evidence in the person's own behalf; (D) the opportunity to question adverse witnesses; and (E) notice of the person's right to be represented by counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.1(a)(2) (2000). These protections serve a variety of interests. Among other things, they safeguard the defendant's obvious stake in preserving his liberty. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Stocks,</i> 104 F.3d 308, 312 (9th Cir.1997). They also serve the sovereign's more nuanced interest in ensuring that important legal determinations are informed by an accurate account of verified facts. <i>See, e.g., Black v. Romano,</i> 471 U.S. 606, 612, 105 S.Ct. 2254, 85 L.Ed.2d 636 (1985); <i>Morrissey,</i> 408 U.S. at 484, 92 S.Ct. 2593.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In our system of criminal justice, most rights can be waived. <i>See United States v. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d 14, 21 (1st Cir. 2001) (cataloguing examples). The rights enumerated in Rule 32.1 are no exception. As a general proposition, however, the waiver of virtually any right closely affecting individual liberty must be knowingly and voluntarily made. <i>See, e.g., Brady v. United States,</i> 397 U.S. 742, 748, 90 S.Ct. 1463, 25 L.Ed.2d 747 (1970) (discussing waiver of rights incident to guilty plea); <i>Adams v. United States,</i> 317 U.S. 269, 275, 63 S.Ct. 236, 87 L.Ed. 268 (1942) (discussing waiver of right to jury trial); <i>Johnson v. Zerbst,</i> 304 U.S. 458, 464, 58 S.Ct. 1019, 82 L.Ed. 1461 (1938) (discussing waiver of right to counsel); <i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 24 (discussing waiver of right to appeal). Because adherence to the processes prescribed by Rule 32.1 is instrumental to the fair and efficient operation of revocation proceedings, we hold that a waiver of the rights conferred thereunder cannot be effective unless that waiver is made both knowingly and voluntarily. <i>Accord United States v. LeBlanc,</i> 175 F.3d 511, 515 (7th Cir.1999); <i>United States v. Pelensky,</i> 129 F.3d 63, 68 n. 9 (2d Cir.1997); <i>Stocks,</i> 104 F.3d at 312.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ideally, the district court, when confronted with an attempted waiver, will advise the probationer, parolee, or person on supervised release of both the rights afforded him by Rule 32.1 and the consequences of a relinquishment of those rights. Because we are mindful that revocation proceedings are more informal than criminal prosecutions, <i>see Morrissey,</i> 408 U.S. at 480, 92 S.Ct. 2593; <i>United States v. Jones,</i> 299 F.3d 103, 110 (2d Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Miller,</i> 797 F.2d 336, 340 (6th Cir.1986), we do not prescribe any particular mantra. Instead, we emulate several of our sister circuits and hold that, notwithstanding the requirement that waivers of procedural rights with respect to revocation hearings must be knowing and voluntary, such waivers need not be accompanied either by any magic words or by a formal colloquy of the depth and intensity required under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 (governing guilty pleas in criminal cases). <i>See LeBlanc,</i> 175 F.3d at 515-16; <i>Pelensky,</i> 129 F.3d at 67-68 (collecting cases); <i>United States v. Rapert,</i> 813 F.2d 182, 184-85 (8th Cir.1987); <i>cf. United States v. Proctor,</i> 166 F.3d 396, 401 &amp; n. 5 (1st Cir.1999) (noting that waivers of some rights must be scrutinized more closely than others).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This protocol has real significance for purposes of appellate review. Where, as here, a probationer, parolee, or person on supervised release mounts a retrospective challenge to the validity of a waiver of Rule 32.1 rights, a reviewing court should look not only to the punctilio of the sentencing court's colloquy with the probationer, parolee, or person on supervised release, but also to the totality of the attendant circumstances. <i>See LeBlanc,</i> 175 F.3d at 517; <i>United States v. Green,</i> 168 F.Supp.2d 383, 385 (E.D.Pa.2001); <i>cf. United States v. Woodard,</i> 291 F.3d 95, 109 (1st Cir.2002) (applying this mode of examination to waivers of the right to counsel); <i>Smart v. Gillette Co. Long-Term Disab. Plan,</i> 70 F.3d 173, 181 (1st Cir. 1995) (applying this mode of examination to waivers of employment rights).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The totality of the circumstances means exactly that &#8212; all the circumstances should be considered. Still, some circumstances are likely to have particular relevance in the revocation hearing context. These include evidence that sheds light upon the target's comprehension of the charges against him and evidence as to his appreciation of the nature of the rights afforded him by Rule 32.1. In the final analysis, however, courts should beware of assigning talismanic significance to any single fact or circumstance. The question of waiver entails endless permutations, and each case is quite likely to be sui generis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Instant Waiver.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the proceedings in this case. We find no evidentiary support for the government's ipse dixit that the appellant understood either his rights or the significance of his waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin this phase of our discussion by observing that the district court never made a specific finding that the appellant's waiver was knowing and voluntary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> While such an express finding is not ordinarily required in connection with a waiver of rights, <i>see United States v. Segal,</i> 549 F.2d 1293, 1300-01 (9th Cir. 1977), it is infinitely more difficult to find a valid waiver based on a silent record. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Boykin v. Alabama,</i> 395 U.S. 238, 243, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d 274 (1969) (refusing to draw such an inference in the guilty plea context).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apart from the absence of a specific finding, nothing in the record adequately evinces that the appellant understood the nature of the accusation that triggered the revocation proceeding. The charges lodged against him in the Puerto Rico courts were dismissed, and the facts underlying those charges were never clearly set forth in the federal court proceedings. The exchanges between the court and defense counsel at the revocation hearing itself did little to clarify matters, nor did they establish with any precision the appellant's version of the underlying events. The appellant said very little over the course of the hearing, and what little he did say, quoted <i>supra,</i> suggests a belief that he may not have committed a crime at all. At the very least, his cryptic comment may have indicated a failure to appreciate the nature of the charges lodged against him. <i>See, e.g., LeBlanc,</i> 175 F.3d at 515-17 (finding that a \"confused colloquy with the court\" evidenced the defendant's failure to comprehend the charges). We do not know because that comment was left unexplored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By like token, there is no reason to believe that the appellant knew his rights. After all, the record does not reflect either that the court advised the appellant of his rights or that counsel reviewed those rights with him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> One cannot knowingly waive rights if one does not realize that they exist. In the circumstances of this case, an affirmative showing that someone had advised the appellant of his Rule 32.1 rights and explained the effect of a decision not to exercise those rights would seem to be a necessary concomitant to finding a knowing waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a critical point. It not only goes to whether the appellant knew that he could put the government to its proof (i.e., require meaningful disclosure of the evidence against him and the opportunity to cross-examine the government's witnesses) but also to whether he knew that he was entitled to offer evidence in his own behalf (including evidence in mitigation). Presentation of mitigation evidence is \"[a] further and equally important step [] necessary to determine whether such a violation warrants revocation and, if so, what sentence shall be imposed.\" <i>United States v. Diaz-Burgos,</i> 601 F.2d 983, 985 (9th Cir.1979) (per curiam). Given the unsettled state of the predicate facts, a simple allocution by an untutored defendant hardly seems an adequate surrogate for this right. <i>See United States v. Dodson,</i> 25 F.3d 385, 388-90 (6th Cir.1994) (observing that \"the unskilled or uneducated probationer or parolee may well have difficulty in presenting his version of a disputed set of facts\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; the stakes often reflect upon whether a waiver can be deemed knowing and voluntary. <i>See Town of Newton v. Rumery,</i> 480 U.S. 386, 394, 107 S.Ct. 1187, 94 L.Ed.2d 405 (1987) (considering the gain from a waiver in determining whether it was knowing and voluntary); <i>Melanson v. Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc.,</i> 281 F.3d 272, 278 (1st Cir.2002) (same). In this instance, the appellant had much to gain and little to lose by reserving his Rule 32.1 rights instead of waiving them. On the one hand, had he exercised his rights, the appellant might have successfully refuted the allegations against him, or, in the alternative, might have adduced evidence tending to mitigate the severity of the asserted violation. <i>See Gagnon,</i> 411 U.S. at 786-87, 93 S.Ct. 1756; <i>Diaz-Burgos,</i> 601 F.2d at 985-86. Either way, he might have prevented (or, at least, minimized) the loss of his liberty. Waiving his rights, on the other hand, yielded him no discernible benefit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we recognize that courts generally give defendants the opportunity to waive various of their rights in order to expedite criminal proceedings and bring finality to them. Waivers are not, however, intended \"to leave acquiescent defendants totally exposed to future vagaries (however harsh, unfair, or unforeseeable).\" <i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 25. In this case, there is simply no evidence to show that the appellant knowingly and voluntarily placed himself at risk of such vagaries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> His waiver was, therefore, ineffectual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Remedy.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly discuss the question of remedy. When a term of probation, parole, or supervised release is revoked following an invalid waiver of Rule 32.1 rights, the preferred practice is to vacate the ensuing sentence and start the proceeding afresh. <i>See LeBlanc,</i> 175 F.3d at 518; <i>see also Dodson,</i> 25 F.3d at 390 (vacating post-revocation sentence when probationer was prohibited from testifying on his own behalf). This accords with the praxis typically followed in the wake of a Rule 11 violation. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Abbott,</i> 241 F.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Hernandez-Wilson,</i> 186 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.1999); <i>but cf. United States v. Giron-Reyes,</i> 234 F.3d 78, 83 (1st Cir.2000) (vacating sentence but allowing lower court to reinstate it if a \"meaningful retrospective hearing\" could determine that defendant's guilty plea was competent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we see no reason to deviate from the norm. Thus, we direct the vacatur of the appellant's sentence. On remand, the district court should allow the appellant, if he so elects, to withdraw his prior stipulation and contest the stated basis for revocation of supervised release. The court shall then undertake further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We adopt today a rule to the effect that, if a person facing a proceeding for revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release purposes to waive his rights under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1, the district court has an obligation to ensure that the waiver is made knowingly and voluntarily. The waiver here fails to satisfy that criterion. Consequently, we sustain the defendant's appeal, vacate his sentence, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Vacated and remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> While this appeal was pending, the Criminal Rules were revised.

Because the record in the instant case reflects no such showing, we vacate the appellant's sentence and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion (including an opportunity for the appellant to withdraw his attorney's concession that a sufficient factual basis existed to justify the revocation of his term of supervised release).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 9, 1993, defendant-appellant Jorge L. Correa-Torres pleaded guilty to one count of possessing more than five kilograms of cocaine with intent to distribute and aiding and abetting in the commission of that offense. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1); 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2. The district court sentenced him to eighty months in prison, to be followed by a five-year term of supervised release. The appellant was discharged from the federal penitentiary in 1998, and his term of supervised release commenced at that time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two years later &#8212; while the appellant was still under supervision &#8212; the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico charged him with beating and threatening his girlfriend and damaging her car. <i>See</i> 8 P.R. Laws Ann. &#167;&#167; 632, 633. Although these charges were eventually dropped because the girlfriend refused to cooperate with the local authorities, the incident continued to dog the appellant: the terms of his supervised release prohibited him from committing any federal, state, or local crime, and the domestic abuse allegations, if proven, constituted a clear violation. <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d). So long as the government could prove that the appellant committed the proscribed acts, the terms of his release would be violated even in the absence of an actual conviction. <i>See United States v. Jolibois,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"778157\"><a href=\"/opinion/778157/united-states-v-jeffrey-scott-jolibois/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1110</span></a></span>, 1114 (9th Cir. 2002); <i>see also</i> USSG &#167; 7B1.1, cmt. (n. 1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's probation officer brought the underlying facts to the district court's attention and moved for an order requiring the appellant to show cause why his term of supervised release should not be revoked. The district court issued the show-cause order. That order, along with a notification of the appellant's procedural rights, was served upon the attorney who had represented the appellant at the original trial. Both documents were written in English, and neither contained a Spanish translation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the revocation hearing, the appellant's counsel &#8212; the same lawyer upon whom the show-cause order had been served &#8212; informed the court that, based on his (counsel's) conversations with the appellant's girlfriend, the appellant would not contest the charge. The lawyer then asked the court to be as lenient as possible, emphasizing that the local court had dismissed the domestic violence complaint and that the appellant had an otherwise untarnished record during supervised release. The district court did not inquire of the appellant either as to his understanding of his rights or as to his guilt. In fact, the appellant did not speak at all throughout most of the proceeding, but, instead, relied upon a court-appointed interpreter to follow the ongoing dialogue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court correctly explained that the absence of a conviction was beside the point; revocation of supervised release could be ordered as long as the appellant had committed a proscribed act. Relying upon the waiver &#8212; the fact that the appellant, through counsel, had declined to contest the probation officer's allegations &#8212; the court revoked the term of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court then proceeded to the imposition of sentence. Asked if he wished to say anything in mitigation of punishment, the appellant stated cryptically: \"I think that it is unfair because that was a problem with my former girlfriend.\" The court did not ask him to elaborate. The prosecutor then suggested a sentence at the nadir of the applicable guidelines range, <i>see</i> USSG &#167;&#167; 4B1.2(a), 7B1.1(a), 7B1.4, surmising \"that the defendant [apparently] has accepted the fact that he abused his girlfriend and threatened her, and also threatened to kill her, and damaged her vehicle.\" The court imposed the recommended two-year sentence and added a new three-year term of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant filed a pro se notice of appeal. We appointed counsel for him. The attorney who represents the appellant in this court is not the attorney who represented him below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government challenges our jurisdiction in this matter. It points out that the district court's judgment was entered on November 27, 2000, but that the notice of appeal was not docketed until late December. On this basis, the government insists that the appellant failed to comply with Fed. R.App. P. 4(b)(1)(A), which requires a defendant in a criminal case to file a notice of appeal within ten days after the entry of judgment. <i>See United States v. Podolsky,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198158\"><a href=\"/opinion/198158/united-states-v-podolsky/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">12</span></a></span>, 14-15 (1st Cir. 1998); <i>see also United States v. Morillo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195011\"><a href=\"/opinion/195011/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">8</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 867 (1st Cir.1993) (explaining that the time limits for taking appeals in criminal cases are \"mandatory and jurisdictional\"). This argument lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By the time that the district court judgment was entered on the docket, the appellant was in custody. Under Fed. R.App. P. 4(c)(1), an inmate confined in a correctional institution may file a notice of appeal in a criminal case by depositing it in the institution's internal mail system on or before the last day for filing. The record indicates that the appellant deposited his notice of appeal in the prison's internal mail system on December 4, 2000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> That was less than ten days after the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. Applying the \"prison mailbox\" rule, we hold that the appellant essayed a timely appeal. Accordingly, this court has jurisdiction to hear and determine it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before us, the appellant advances only a single claim: that his waiver of rights was insufficiently informed (and, thus, impuissant). To address this claim, we must consider three discrete but related points. The first implicates the showing that must attend a waiver of Rule 32.1 rights. The second involves the validity of the waiver effected in this case. The third concerns the remedy associated with an invalid waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Waivers of Rule 32.1 Rights.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although revocations of probation, parole, or supervised release are not considered part of a criminal prosecution, they nevertheless entail a loss of freedom and a deprivation of liberty. <i>See Gagnon v.

Fundamental fairness therefore requires that defendants facing such revocations should be afforded notice of the charges against them, an opportunity to confront their accusers, and a chance to present evidence to their own behoof. <i>See Bearden v.

Instead, we emulate several of our sister circuits and hold that, notwithstanding the requirement that waivers of procedural rights with respect to revocation hearings must be knowing and voluntary, such waivers need not be accompanied either by any magic words or by a formal colloquy of the depth and intensity required under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 11 (governing guilty pleas in criminal cases). <i>See LeBlanc,</i> 175 F.3d at 515-16; <i>Pelensky,</i> 129 F.3d at 67-68 (collecting cases); <i>United States v.

Where, as here, a probationer, parolee, or person on supervised release mounts a retrospective challenge to the validity of a waiver of Rule 32.1 rights, a reviewing court should look not only to the punctilio of the sentencing court's colloquy with the probationer, parolee, or person on supervised release, but also to the totality of the attendant circumstances. <i>See LeBlanc,</i> 175 F.3d at 517; <i>United States v.

Still, some circumstances are likely to have particular relevance in the revocation hearing context. These include evidence that sheds light upon the target's comprehension of the charges against him and evidence as to his appreciation of the nature of the rights afforded him by Rule 32.1. In the final analysis, however, courts should beware of assigning talismanic significance to any single fact or circumstance. The question of waiver entails endless permutations, and each case is quite likely to be sui generis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Instant Waiver.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we turn to the proceedings in this case. We find no evidentiary support for the government's ipse dixit that the appellant understood either his rights or the significance of his waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin this phase of our discussion by observing that the district court never made a specific finding that the appellant's waiver was knowing and voluntary.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> While such an express finding is not ordinarily required in connection with a waiver of rights, <i>see United States v. Segal,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"343217\"><a href=\"/opinion/343217/united-states-v-rea-lyn-segal/\"><span class=\"volume\">549</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1293</span></a></span>, 1300-01 (9th Cir. 1977), it is infinitely more difficult to find a valid waiver based on a silent record. <i>Cf.</i> <i>Boykin v. Alabama,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107951\"><a href=\"/opinion/107951/boykin-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">238</span></a></span>, 243, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107951\"><a href=\"/opinion/107951/boykin-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1709</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107951\"><a href=\"/opinion/107951/boykin-v-alabama/\"><span class=\"volume\">23</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></a></span> (1969) (refusing to draw such an inference in the guilty plea context).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apart from the absence of a specific finding, nothing in the record adequately evinces that the appellant understood the nature of the accusation that triggered the revocation proceeding. The charges lodged against him in the Puerto Rico courts were dismissed, and the facts underlying those charges were never clearly set forth in the federal court proceedings. The exchanges between the court and defense counsel at the revocation hearing itself did little to clarify matters, nor did they establish with any precision the appellant's version of the underlying events. The appellant said very little over the course of the hearing, and what little he did say, quoted <i>supra,</i> suggests a belief that he may not have committed a crime at all. At the very least, his cryptic comment may have indicated a failure to appreciate the nature of the charges lodged against him. <i>See, e.g., LeBlanc,</i> 175 F.3d at 515-17 (finding that a \"confused colloquy with the court\" evidenced the defendant's failure to comprehend the charges). We do not know because that comment was left unexplored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By like token, there is no reason to believe that the appellant knew his rights. After all, the record does not reflect either that the court advised the appellant of his rights or that counsel reviewed those rights with him.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> One cannot knowingly waive rights if one does not realize that they exist. In the circumstances of this case, an affirmative showing that someone had advised the appellant of his Rule 32.1 rights and explained the effect of a decision not to exercise those rights would seem to be a necessary concomitant to finding a knowing waiver.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a critical point. It not only goes to whether the appellant knew that he could put the government to its proof (i.e., require meaningful disclosure of the evidence against him and the opportunity to cross-examine the government's witnesses) but also to whether he knew that he was entitled to offer evidence in his own behalf (including evidence in mitigation). Presentation of mitigation evidence is \"[a] further and equally important step [] necessary to determine whether such a violation warrants revocation and, if so, what sentence shall be imposed.\" <i>United States v. Diaz-Burgos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"368101\"><a href=\"/opinion/368101/united-states-v-maximo-diaz-burgos/\"><span class=\"volume\">601</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">983</span></a></span>, 985 (9th Cir.1979) (per curiam). Given the unsettled state of the predicate facts, a simple allocution by an untutored defendant hardly seems an adequate surrogate for this right. <i>See United States v. Dodson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670728\"><a href=\"/opinion/670728/united-states-v-steven-a-dodson/\"><span class=\"volume\">25</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">385</span></a></span>, 388-90 (6th Cir.1994) (observing that \"the unskilled or uneducated probationer or parolee may well have difficulty in presenting his version of a disputed set of facts\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Last &#8212; but far from least &#8212; the stakes often reflect upon whether a waiver can be deemed knowing and voluntary. <i>See Town of Newton v. Rumery,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111837\"><a href=\"/opinion/111837/newton-v-rumery/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">386</span></a></span>, 394, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111837\"><a href=\"/opinion/111837/newton-v-rumery/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1187</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111837\"><a href=\"/opinion/111837/newton-v-rumery/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span> (1987) (considering the gain from a waiver in determining whether it was knowing and voluntary); <i>Melanson v. Browning-Ferris Indus., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199838\"><a href=\"/opinion/199838/melanson-v-browning-ferris/\"><span class=\"volume\">281</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">272</span></a></span>, 278 (1st Cir.2002) (same). In this instance, the appellant had much to gain and little to lose by reserving his Rule 32.1 rights instead of waiving them. On the one hand, had he exercised his rights, the appellant might have successfully refuted the allegations against him, or, in the alternative, might have adduced evidence tending to mitigate the severity of the asserted violation. <i>See Gagnon,</i> 411 U.S. at 786-87, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"108785\"><a href=\"/opinion/108785/gagnon-v-scarpelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1756</span></a></span>; <i>Diaz-Burgos,</i> 601 F.2d at 985-86. Either way, he might have prevented (or, at least, minimized) the loss of his liberty. Waiving his rights, on the other hand, yielded him no discernible benefit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we recognize that courts generally give defendants the opportunity to waive various of their rights in order to expedite criminal proceedings and bring finality to them. Waivers are not, however, intended \"to leave acquiescent defendants totally exposed to future vagaries (however harsh, unfair, or unforeseeable).\" <i>Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d at 25. In this case, there is simply no evidence to show that the appellant knowingly and voluntarily placed himself at risk of such vagaries.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> His waiver was, therefore, ineffectual.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Remedy.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly discuss the question of remedy. When a term of probation, parole, or supervised release is revoked following an invalid waiver of Rule 32.1 rights, the preferred practice is to vacate the ensuing sentence and start the proceeding afresh. <i>See LeBlanc,</i> 175 F.3d at 518; <i>see also Dodson,</i> 25 F.3d at 390 (vacating post-revocation sentence when probationer was prohibited from testifying on his own behalf). This accords with the praxis typically followed in the wake of a Rule 11 violation. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Abbott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199283\"><a href=\"/opinion/199283/united-states-v-abbott/\"><span class=\"volume\">241</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Hernandez-Wilson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198576\"><a href=\"/opinion/198576/united-states-v-hernandez/\"><span class=\"volume\">186</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6-7 (1st Cir.1999); <i>but cf. United States v. Giron-Reyes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199188\"><a href=\"/opinion/199188/united-states-v-giron-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">234</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">78</span></a></span>, 83 (1st Cir.2000) (vacating sentence but allowing lower court to reinstate it if a \"meaningful retrospective hearing\" could determine that defendant's guilty plea was competent).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, we see no reason to deviate from the norm. Thus, we direct the vacatur of the appellant's sentence. On remand, the district court should allow the appellant, if he so elects, to withdraw his prior stipulation and contest the stated basis for revocation of supervised release. The court shall then undertake further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. We adopt today a rule to the effect that, if a person facing a proceeding for revocation of probation, parole, or supervised release purposes to waive his rights under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 32.1, the district court has an obligation to ensure that the waiver is made knowingly and voluntarily. The waiver here fails to satisfy that criterion. Consequently, we sustain the defendant's appeal, vacate his sentence, and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Vacated and remanded.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> While this appeal was pending, the Criminal Rules were revised.
