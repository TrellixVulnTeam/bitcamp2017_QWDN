Patti B. Saris, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                     Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                       and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n          Tina Schneider for appellant.\n          Heidi E. Brieger, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           October 11, 2007\n\f             LIPEZ, Circuit Judge. Following a conviction for various\n\ncharges stemming from his operation of a heroin distribution\n\norganization, appellant Roberto Portes challenges the sentence\n\nimposed by the district court.         Specifically, he contends that the\n\ncourt committed error by (1) sentencing him pursuant to a statute\n\nwith an increased statutory maximum on the basis of a drug quantity\n\nthat the jury did not find beyond a reasonable doubt, in violation\n\nof Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000); and (2) treating\n\nthe Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, in contravention of United\n\nStates v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).           We reject both claims --\n\nthe former due to the overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted\n\nevidence of the requisite quantity of drugs, and the latter because\n\nPortes has failed to demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that the\n\ndistrict court would impose a different sentence under an advisory\n\nGuidelines regime.     Consequently, we affirm Portes's sentence.\n\n                                       I.\n\nA. Factual Background\n\n             In 1994, the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\")\n\nbegan an investigation of a heroin distribution organization that\n\nPortes operated.      At trial, four of Portes's former employees\n\n(Jorge Luis Diaz-Mejia, Nelson Marrero-Morrel, Hector Mena-Perez,\n\nand   Elso    Valverde),   who   had    agreed   to   cooperate   with   the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fgovernment, testified about the mechanics of the organization.1\n\nOne participant would drive from Worcester, Massachusetts to New\n\nYork once or twice a week to retrieve drugs from a contact there.\n\nThe cash to purchase the drugs would be transported to New York in\n\na secret compartment in the Buick; the drugs would be placed in\n\nthat compartment on the return trip.              Back in Worcester, the\n\nparticipants   would   weigh   and    package     the   heroin    at    various\n\nlocations, including Portes's residence at 47 Florence Street; a\n\nroom at the Clarion Suites Hotel rented in the name of Junior Pena,\n\none of Portes's aliases; a space leased at One Wayne Terrace; and\n\nthe residence of Rodolfo Matos, another of Portes's employees. Law\n\nenforcement agents surveilled all these locations at various times.\n\nThey also rented a room across the hall from the room at the\n\nClarion   Suites   Hotel,   from   which   they    observed      most   of   the\n\nparticipants in the conspiracy arriving at and leaving the room,\n\nsometimes putting items into their pockets.\n\n           The four cooperating witnesses testified that Portes\n\nemployed them in processing and distributing the heroin.                     They\n\nperformed tasks such as sealing envelopes containing heroin, using\n\na press to make one ounce tablets of heroin, and delivering\n\npackages of heroin to customers.       Mena-Perez testified that Portes\n\n\n\n\n     1\n       These former employees also were charged with various drug\noffenses, but pled guilty rather than go to trial.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fkept ledgers recording the amount of heroin delivered to various\n\ncustomers and the amount of money those customers owed.\n\n           A DEA special agent, acting in an undercover capacity,\n\narranged to purchase heroin from Matos on five occasions.       On\n\nJanuary 24, 1995, the agent met Matos at 16 Svea Street in\n\nWorcester and paid him $7,400 for two ounces (55.1 grams) of heroin\n\nin a compressed, tablet form wrapped in red and white paper and\n\ntape.   On February 23, the agent met Matos at Matos's residence in\n\nWorcester and paid him $11,400 for three ounces (84.3 grams) of\n\nheroin.    Prior to this meeting, Matos went to Portes's residence;\n\nshortly thereafter, Marrero-Morel and Valverde went to the Clarion\n\nSuites Hotel for about five minutes, then returned to Portes's\n\nresidence.   Matos then returned to his own residence.\n\n           On May 2, the agent purchased two ounces (55.7 grams) of\n\nheroin from Matos for $7,600 while they sat in a white Buick\n\nLeSabre.   Matos retrieved the heroin from a secret compartment in\n\nthe glove compartment of the car. Prior to this transaction, Matos\n\nwent to Portes's residence, where he met Portes, Mena-Perez, and\n\nRuben Perez.    After exiting Portes's residence, Matos and Perez\n\nentered the Buick, which was parked outside, and Perez appeared to\n\n\"fiddle\" with the glove compartment area.    Perez then got out of\n\nthe car and Matos drove to meet the agent in the Buick.\n\n           On June 1, the agent met Matos at the Auburn Mall in\n\nWorcester and paid him $7,600 for two ounces (56.1 grams) of\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fheroin.   At that time the agent indicated that he wished to\n\npurchase a larger quantity of heroin for a discounted price.\n\nSubsequently, the agent and Matos negotiated over the phone for the\n\nsale of eight ounces of heroin for $29,600.   Diaz-Mejia testified\n\nthat, on August 10, he saw Portes wrapping and sealing nine one-\n\nounce tablets of heroin inside One Wayne Terrace.      The planned\n\ntransaction never occurred because most of the defendants were\n\narrested that day.      However, in executing search warrants, law\n\nenforcement agents seized nine ounces (251.3 grams) of heroin from\n\nthe hidden compartment of the Buick.     They also seized a large\n\nquantity of drug paraphernalia from One Wayne Terrace, much of\n\nwhich contained trace amounts of heroin, and a bag containing 14.5\n\ngrams of heroin in a powdered form.\n\nB. Procedural History\n\n          The second superseding indictment, returned on June 6,\n\n1996, brought various charges relating to the heroin distribution\n\norganization against Portes and his co-defendants.2   Three counts\n\n\n     2\n       Nine defendants were charged in the original indictment, of\nwhom only Portes and Julio Santana went to trial. Jorge Luis Diaz-\nMejia, Nelson Marrero-Morrel, Hector Mena-Perez, and Elso Valverde\npled guilty and, as noted, testified for the government at trial.\nMatos, Luis Adolfo Diaz, and Mayra Lopez pled guilty but were not\ninvolved in Portes's trial. Santana was tried separately in March\n1996 for conspiracy to possess cocaine base with the intent to\ndistribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, but the district\ncourt declared a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a\nverdict. Following a second trial, Santana was convicted on all\ncounts in April 1996, but we reversed his conviction in May 1999,\nsee United States v. Santana, 175 F.3d 57 (1st Cir. 1999). Santana\nsubsequently pled guilty in November 1999.      A tenth defendant,\n\n                                -5-\n\fwere relevant to Portes.            Count One charged Portes and various\n\nothers with conspiracy to possess heroin with intent to distribute,\n\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and § 846.                    Count Four\n\ncharged Portes with the possession of heroin with the intent to\n\ndistribute it on August 10, 1995, in connection with the \"alleged\n\nheroin found at One Wayne Terrace,\" in violation of 21 U.S.C. §\n\n841(a)(1).     Count Five charged Portes with possession, and aiding\n\nand abetting Mena-Perez's possession of, heroin on August 10, 1995,\n\nwith the intent to distribute it, in connection with the \"heroin\n\nallegedly found in the white Buick LeSabre,\" in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2.              On these three counts, the\n\nindictment did not include any specific allegations with respect to\n\nthe quantity of drugs involved.\n\n             At trial, the district court did not instruct the jury\n\nthat it must find any specific quantity of drugs.3                  Indeed, its\n\ninstructions stated:       \"If you find that the material involved is\n\nheroin, beyond a reasonable doubt, you need not be concerned about\n\nthe quantity.\"        The jury returned a guilty verdict on the three\n\ndrug counts related to Portes.\n\n             The Presentence Report (\"PSR\") stated that Portes was\n\nresponsible     for   an   amount    of   heroin    between   ten   and   thirty\n\n\nEduardo Perez, was identified following the filing of the original\nindictment, charged in the second superseding indictment, and\nsubsequently entered a guilty plea.\n     3\n         Portes did not request such an instruction.\n\n                                       -6-\n\fkilograms, resulting in a base offense level of thirty-six.                      The\n\nPSR added several enhancements: two levels for the gun found at One\n\nWayne Terrace, under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1); four levels because\n\nPortes was a leader of a criminal activity involving five or more\n\nparticipants,    under     U.S.S.G.        §    3B1.1(a);   and   two   levels   for\n\nobstructing     justice     due   to    Portes's        threats   to    cooperating\n\ndefendants,     under     U.S.S.G.     §       3C1.1.     After   totaling   these\n\nenhancements, the PSR concluded that Portes was subject to the\n\nmaximum offense level of forty-three. The PSR also established the\n\nsentencing range for each offense: a ten-year mandatory minimum and\n\na statutory maximum of life imprisonment on Count One; a maximum of\n\ntwenty years' imprisonment on Count Four; and a five-year mandatory\n\nminimum and a statutory maximum of forty years on Count Five.\n\n          Portes objected to the drug quantity stated in the PSR,\n\ncontending that, \"based upon the testimony at the trial, it is\n\nimpossible to calculate the quantity of heroin attributed to him to\n\nbe in the range of 10 kilograms.\"                  He contended that the only\n\nheroin attributable to him should be the amount related to \"the\n\nspecific offenses that he was charged with in the indictment.\"\n\n          Prior to sentencing Portes, the district court conducted\n\na four-day evidentiary hearing. The government presented testimony\n\nfrom five cooperating witnesses,4 who testified regarding the\n\n\n\n     4\n       The five witnesses included the four who testified at\nPortes's trial as well as Eduardo Perez.\n\n                                           -7-\n\famount of heroin involved in Portes's offenses; and from a DEA\n\nspecial agent, who testified that, based on his review of the drug\n\nledgers, the statements of the nine cooperating defendants, the\n\nheroin seized, and the heroin purchased, the conspiracy involved a\n\ntotal of 21,584 grams of heroin.        Portes contested this drug\n\nquantity calculation, disputing the credibility of the government's\n\ncooperating witnesses as to drug quantity and arguing that the\n\namount in question was \"less than ten kilograms.\"\n\n          The court concluded that Portes was responsible for more\n\nthan three kilograms of heroin \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" and for\n\nseven to eight kilograms of heroin \"by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence.\" In making these determinations, the court relied on the\n\nheroin seized from One Wayne Terrace and the Buick, the heroin that\n\nMatos sold to the undercover agent, and the heroin listed in the\n\ndrug ledgers (which the court discounted somewhat because the\n\nledgers   included   entries   for    cocaine   as   well   as   heroin\n\ntransactions).   The court stated that it did not rely on the\n\ncooperating witnesses' testimony in making these determinations.\n\nBased on this drug quantity, the court determined that Portes's\n\nbase offense level was thirty-four; after applying the enhancements\n\ndescribed in the PSR, his total offense level was forty-two.         It\n\nthen sentenced him to thirty years' imprisonment on Counts One and\n\nFive and twenty years' imprisonment on Count Four, to be served\n\nconcurrently. It also sentenced Portes to five years of supervised\n\n\n                                -8-\n\frelease on each count, to be served concurrently, and ordered him\n\nto pay a $1 million fine.        Portes now appeals this sentence.\n\n                                     II.\n\n            Portes raises two claims on appeal.           First, he argues\n\nthat the district court's reliance on drug quantities that were not\n\nfound by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt violated Apprendi v. New\n\nJersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000). Second, he contends that the district\n\ncourt treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, in violation\n\nof United States v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).\n\nA. Apprendi Error\n\n            In Apprendi, the Supreme Court held that “[o]ther than\n\nthe fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty\n\nfor   a   crime   beyond   the   prescribed   statutory   maximum   must   be\n\nsubmitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.”                530\n\nU.S. at 490.      Portes was convicted and sentenced four years prior\n\nto this decision.     He did not challenge the grand jury’s failure to\n\ncharge a specific drug quantity in the indictment, nor did he\n\nchallenge the district court’s failure to submit the issue of drug\n\nquantity to the jury to decide beyond a reasonable doubt.                   At\n\nsentencing, he objected to the quantity of drugs the district court\n\nused in its calculation.\n\n            We have held that merely objecting to the quantity of\n\ndrugs is insufficient to preserve an Apprendi claim. United States\n\nv. Terry, 240 F.3d 65, 72-73 & n.7 (1st Cir. 2001); United States\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fv. LaFreniere, 236 F.3d 41, 48 (1st Cir. 2001).                       Thus, we review\n\nPortes's Apprendi claim for plain error under Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure 52(b).           Under such review, “‘there must be (1)\n\nerror,   (2)    that   is    plain,    and     (3)    that     affects      substantial\n\nrights.’”       United States v. Cotton, 535 U.S. 625, 631 (2002)\n\n(quoting Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 466-67 (1997)\n\n(internal    quotation      marks     omitted)).        If     such    an    error   has\n\noccurred, we may then “‘exercise [our] discretion to notice a\n\nforfeited error, but only if . . . the error seriously affects the\n\nfairness,       integrity,       or    public         reputation        of      judicial\n\nproceedings.’”     Id. (quoting Johnson, 520 U.S. at 467).\n\n            The punishment for a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a) and\n\n§ 846 varies in relation to the quantity of controlled substance\n\ninvolved in the violation. If the violation involved more than one\n\nkilogram of heroin, the sentencing exposure is ten years to life\n\nimprisonment.     Id. § 841(b)(1)(A).          If the violation involved more\n\nthan one hundred grams of heroin, the statute provides a mandatory\n\nminimum of five years’ imprisonment and a maximum of forty years’\n\nimprisonment.      For all other quantities of heroin, the “default”\n\nprovision      establishes      a   statutory        maximum    of     twenty    years’\n\nimprisonment.     Id. § 841(b)(1)(C).\n\n            The district court sentenced Portes to thirty years’\n\nimprisonment.      However, none of the three heroin counts in the\n\nindictment     included     a   specific     allegation         of    drug    quantity.\n\n\n                                        -10-\n\fConsequently, the jury was not asked to find any specific quantity\n\nof heroin, leaving Portes subject, on the basis of the jury\n\nverdict, only to the “default” statutory maximum sentence of twenty\n\nyears.   As the government correctly concedes, this omission meets\n\nthe first two prongs of plain error review: there was an error in\n\nformulating Portes's sentence, and that error was obvious in light\n\nof Apprendi.      See Cotton, 535 U.S. at 632.\n\n            We need not decide whether this error affected Portes's\n\nsubstantial rights under the third prong of plain error review\n\nbecause, in any event, the error did not seriously affect the\n\nfairness,    integrity,      or   public    reputation    of   the   judicial\n\nproceedings.       This case is strikingly similar to the Supreme\n\nCourt's decision in Cotton. There, the defendants challenged their\n\nsentences on the ground that the indictment charging them with\n\nconspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute did\n\nnot allege the threshold drug quantity necessary to apply an\n\nenhanced statutory penalty.        Id. at 628.     Although the defendants\n\nthus should have been subject to a “default” twenty-year statutory\n\nmaximum,    the   district   court    sentenced    them   to   thirty   years’\n\nimprisonment because evidence introduced at trial demonstrated that\n\nthe conspiracy involved a sufficient quantity of cocaine base to\n\nqualify for an increased maximum.            Id.   The defendants did not\n\nobject at trial      or at sentencing to the lack of a specific\n\nallegation of drug quantity.         Id.\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f            Applying plain error review, the Supreme Court explained\n\nthat,     \"even       assuming       [defendants']        substantial         rights       were\n\naffected,       the    error     did     not    seriously          affect    the   fairness,\n\nintegrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"                               Id. at\n\n632-33.     The Court upheld the sentence on the ground that the\n\nevidence that the drug quantity exceeded the level required for\n\nenhancement was “overwhelming” and “essentially uncontroverted,”\n\nexplaining       that    “[s]urely        the     grand      jury,    having       found   the\n\nconspiracy existed, would have also found that the conspiracy\n\ninvolved” the requisite drug quantity. Id. at 633; see also United\n\nStates v. Terry, 240 F.3d 65, 74-75 (1st Cir. 2001)(holding, in the\n\nalternative,          that   the     failure      to    charge       the     relevant      drug\n\nquantities      in     the   indictment         was    not    plain     error      where    the\n\n\"uncontested testimony of a DEA chemist at trial established the\n\nquantities and types of the drugs\" and \"[t]here is no question that\n\nthe petit jury in this case would have found [the defendant's]\n\noffenses    to       involve\"      the    requisite       amount       for    an   increased\n\nstatutory maximum).\n\n            As in Cotton, the evidence regarding the drug quantity\n\nfor     which     Portes       was       responsible         was     \"overwhelming\"         and\n\n\"essentially uncontroverted.\"                  Considerable evidence supported the\n\nfact that more than one hundred grams of heroin (the amount\n\nnecessary to increase the maximum sentence to forty years under §\n\n841(b)(1)(B)) were involved in each of the relevant charges.                               With\n\n\n                                               -12-\n\frespect   to   Count   Five,   there   was   no   dispute    that   the   Buick\n\ncontained 251.3 grams of heroin.          With respect to the conspiracy\n\ncharge, the total amount of heroin that the agent purchased from\n\nMatos and the heroin seized from the Buick and One Wayne Terrace\n\nundisputedly totaled over five hundred grams.               Indeed, the drug\n\nledgers introduced into evidence at trial and the cooperating\n\nwitnesses’ testimony indicated that the total amount of heroin in\n\nfact was over one kilogram, which would have raised the maximum\n\nsentence to life imprisonment under § 841(b)(1)(A).\n\n           Although Portes actively challenged the government's case\n\nagainst him, he focused on whether he committed the offenses and\n\nnot on the drug quantities at issue.          For example, Portes argued\n\nthat he was not involved in the drug transactions and that the\n\nBuick was not his.      However, he did not contend that the heroin\n\nfound in the Buick and at One Wayne Terrace weighed less than the\n\ngovernment claimed.5      We thus think that the situation here is\n\nanalogous to Cotton.      Given that the jury found Portes guilty of\n\nthe charged offenses, it also would have found that his crimes\n\n\n\n\n     5\n       Indeed, Portes himself, in his objection to the PSR, stated\nthat the amount of heroin attributable to him should be only that\nassociated with \"the specific offenses that he was charged with in\nthe indictment.\"     The amount associated with those specific\noffenses consists of the 251.3 grams found in the Buick and the\n14.5 grams found at One Wayne Terrace.\n\n                                   -13-\n\finvolved the uncontroverted drug amounts found in the Buick and at\n\nOne Wayne Terrace and purchased by the undercover agent.6\n\n          Thus, the court's reliance on this drug quantity in\n\nsentencing did not impair the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of the judicial proceedings. We therefore conclude that\n\nthere was no plain error in the district court's decision to\n\nsentence Portes to thirty years' imprisonment.\n\nB. Booker Error\n\n          Portes also contends that, by sentencing him under a\n\nmandatory Sentencing Guidelines regime, the district court violated\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. 220, which held that the Sentencing Guidelines are\n\nadvisory rather than mandatory. To preserve this claim for appeal,\n\na defendant must have raised and argued error under Apprendi, 530\n\nU.S. 466, or Blakely v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296 (2004), or\n\nchallenged the constitutionality of a mandatory Guidelines regime.\n\nUnited States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\nPortes raised none of these arguments before the district court,\n\nand so we review his claim for plain error.   Id.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n        Portes did argue at sentencing that the cooperating\nwitnesses' testimony about the drug quantities was unreliable, and\nthat the drug ledgers also were unreliable because they did not\nclearly differentiate between cocaine and heroin amounts. However,\neven if we wholly disregard that evidence in calculating the amount\nof drugs, the uncontroverted amounts found in the Buick and at One\nWayne Terrace and purchased by the undercover agent total well in\nexcess of the one hundred grams necessary to increase the statutory\nmaximum to forty years' imprisonment.\n\n                               -14-\n\f          We have held that a defendant has met the first two\n\nprongs of plain error review if, as here, the district court\n\ntreated   the   Guidelines   as   mandatory    rather     than     advisory.\n\nAntonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75. However, Portes has failed to meet\n\nthe third prong of plain error review by demonstrating that this\n\nerror affected his substantial rights.        See Johnson, 520 U.S. at\n\n466-67.   This prong places the burden on a defendant alleging a\n\nBooker error to \"point to circumstances creating a reasonable\n\nprobability that the district court would impose a different\n\nsentence more favorable to the defendant under the new 'advisory\n\nGuidelines' Booker regime.\"        Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d at 75.\n\nPortes has alleged no such circumstances.           Nothing in the record\n\nindicates that the district court was troubled by the sentence it\n\nimposed or that it would have imposed a lower sentence if the\n\nGuidelines had been advisory at that time. Indeed, Portes's Booker\n\nclaim rests largely on his Apprendi claim that the court plainly\n\nerred in sentencing him above the \"default\" statutory maximum.\n\nSince we have ruled against him on that claim, the record is devoid\n\nof anything suggesting a \"reasonable probability\" that the district\n\ncourt would impose a sentence more favorable to Portes.             Thus, we\n\nfind no plain error in the district court's application of a\n\nmandatory Guidelines sentencing scheme.\n\n                                  III.\n\n          For   the   aformentioned      reasons,    we   affirm    Portes's\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fsentence.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                          -16-\n\f",

Specifically, he contends that the court committed error by (1) sentencing him pursuant to a statute with an increased statutory maximum on the basis of a drug quantity that the jury did not find beyond a reasonable doubt, in violation of <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000); and (2) treating the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, in contravention of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We reject both claims  the former due to the overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted evidence of the requisite quantity of drugs, and the latter because Portes has failed to demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that the district court would impose a different sentence under an advisory Guidelines regime. Consequently, we affirm Portes's sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>A. Factual Background</p>\n<p>In 1994, the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") began an investigation of a heroin distribution organization that Portes operated. At trial, four of Portes's former employees (Jorge Luis Diaz-Mejia, Nelson Marrero-Morrel, Hector Mena-Perez, and Elso Valverde), who had agreed to cooperate with the government, testified about the mechanics of the organization.<sup>[1]</sup> One participant would drive from Worcester, Massachusetts to New York once or twice a week to retrieve drugs from a contact there. The cash to purchase the drugs would be transported to New York in a secret compartment in the Buick; the drugs would be placed in that compartment on the return trip. Back in Worcester, the participants would weigh and package the heroin at various locations, including Portes's residence at 47 Florence Street; a room at the Clarion Suites Hotel rented in the name of Junior Pena, one of Portes's aliases; a space leased at One Wayne Terrace; and the residence of Rodolfo Matos, another of Portes's employees. Law enforcement agents surveilled all these locations at various times. They also rented a room across the hall from the room at the Clarion Suites Hotel, from which they observed most of the participants in the conspiracy arriving at and leaving the room, sometimes putting items into their pockets.</p>\n<p>The four cooperating witnesses testified that Portes employed them in processing and distributing the heroin. They performed tasks such as sealing envelopes containing heroin, using a press to make one ounce tablets of heroin, and delivering packages of heroin to customers. Mena-Perez testified that Portes kept ledgers recording the amount of heroin delivered to various customers and the amount of money those customers owed.</p>\n<p>A DEA special agent, acting in an undercover capacity, arranged to purchase heroin from Matos on five occasions. On January 24, 1995, the agent met Matos at 16 Svea Street in Worcester and paid him $7,400 for two ounces (55.1 grams) of heroin in a compressed, tablet form wrapped in red and white paper and tape. On February 23, the agent met Matos at Matos's residence in Worcester and paid him $11,400 for three ounces (84.3 grams) of heroin. Prior to this meeting, Matos went to Portes's residence; shortly thereafter, Marrero-Morel and Valverde went to the Clarion Suites Hotel for about five minutes, then returned to Portes's residence. Matos then returned to his own residence.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> On May 2, the agent purchased two ounces (55.7 grams) of heroin from Matos for $7,600 while they sat in a white Buick LeSabre. Matos retrieved the heroin from a secret compartment in the glove compartment of the car. Prior to this transaction, Matos went to Portes's residence, where he met Portes, Mena-Perez, and Ruben Perez. After exiting Portes's residence, Matos and Perez entered the Buick, which was parked outside, and Perez appeared to \"fiddle\" with the glove compartment area. Perez then got out of the car and Matos drove to meet the agent in the Buick.</p>\n<p>On June 1, the agent met Matos at the Auburn Mall in Worcester and paid him $7,600 for two ounces (56.1 grams) of heroin. At that time the agent indicated that he wished to purchase a larger quantity of heroin for a discounted price. Subsequently, the agent and Matos negotiated over the phone for the sale of eight ounces of heroin for $29,600. Diaz-Mejia testified that, on August 10, he saw Portes wrapping and sealing nine one-ounce tablets of heroin inside One Wayne Terrace. The planned transaction never occurred because most of the defendants were arrested that day. However, in executing search warrants, law enforcement agents seized nine ounces (251.3 grams) of heroin from the hidden compartment of the Buick. They also seized a large quantity of drug paraphernalia from One Wayne Terrace, much of which contained trace amounts of heroin, and a bag containing 14.5 grams of heroin in a powdered form.</p>\n<p>B. Procedural History</p>\n<p>The second superseding indictment, returned on June 6, 1996, brought various charges relating to the heroin distribution organization against Portes and his codefendants.<sup>[2]</sup> Three counts were relevant to Portes. Count One charged Portes and various others with conspiracy to possess heroin with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and § 846. Count Four charged Portes with the possession of heroin with the intent to distribute it on August 10, 1995, in connection with the \"alleged heroin found at One Wayne Terrace,\" in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Count Five charged Portes with possession, and aiding and abetting Mena-Perez's possession of, heroin on August 10, 1995, with the intent to distribute it, in connection with the \"heroin allegedly found in the white Buick LeSabre,\" in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2. On these three counts, the indictment did not include any specific allegations with respect to the quantity of drugs involved.</p>\n<p>At trial, the district court did not instruct the jury that it must find any specific quantity of drugs.<sup>[3]</sup> Indeed, its instructions stated: \"If you find that the material involved is heroin, beyond a reasonable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> doubt, you need not be concerned about the quantity.\" The jury returned a guilty verdict on the three drug counts related to Portes.</p>\n<p>The Presentence Report (\"PSR\") stated that Portes was responsible for an amount of heroin between ten and thirty kilograms, resulting in a base offense level of thirty-six. The PSR added several enhancements: two levels for the gun found at One Wayne Terrace, under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1); four levels because Portes was a leader of a criminal activity involving five or more participants, under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a); and two levels for obstructing justice due to Portes's threats to cooperating defendants, under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1. After totaling these enhancements, the PSR concluded that Portes was subject to the maximum offense level of forty-three. The PSR also established the sentencing range for each offense: a ten-year mandatory minimum and a statutory maximum of life imprisonment on Count One; a maximum of twenty years' imprisonment on Count Four; and a five-year mandatory minimum and a statutory maximum of forty years on Count Five.</p>\n<p>Portes objected to the drug quantity stated in the PSR, contending that, \"based upon the testimony at the trial, it is impossible to calculate the quantity of heroin attributed to him to be in the range of 10 kilograms.\" He contended that the only heroin attributable to him should be the amount related to \"the specific offenses that he was charged with in the indictment.\"</p>\n<p>Prior to sentencing Portes, the district court conducted a four-day evidentiary hearing. The government presented testimony from five cooperating witnesses,<sup>[4]</sup> who testified regarding the amount of heroin involved in Portes's offenses; and from a DEA special agent, who testified that, based on his review of the drug ledgers, the statements of the nine cooperating defendants, the heroin seized, and the heroin purchased, the conspiracy involved a total of 21,584 grams of heroin. Portes contested this drug quantity calculation, disputing the credibility of the government's cooperating witnesses as to drug quantity and arguing that the amount in question was \"less than ten kilograms.\"</p>\n<p>The court concluded that Portes was responsible for more than three kilograms of heroin \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" and for seven to eight kilograms of heroin \"by a preponderance of the evidence.\" In making these determinations, the court relied on the heroin seized from One Wayne Terrace and the Buick, the heroin that Matos sold to the undercover agent, and the heroin listed in the drug ledgers (which the court discounted somewhat because the ledgers included entries for cocaine as well as heroin transactions). The court stated that it did not rely on the cooperating witnesses' testimony in making these determinations. Based on this drug quantity, the court determined that Portes's base offense level was thirty-four; after applying the enhancements described in the PSR, his total offense level was forty-two. It then sentenced him to thirty years' imprisonment on Counts One and Five and twenty years' imprisonment on Count Four, to be served concurrently. It also sentenced Portes to five years of supervised release on each count, to be served concurrently, and ordered him to pay a $1 million fine. Portes now appeals this sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> II.</h2>\n<p>Portes raises two claims on appeal. First, he argues that the district court's reliance on drug quantities that were not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt violated <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000). Second, he contends that the district court treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, in violation of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005).</p>\n<p>A. <i>Apprendi</i> Error</p>\n<p>In <i>Apprendi,</i> the Supreme Court held that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 530 U.S. at 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348. Portes was convicted and sentenced four years prior to this decision. He did not challenge the grand jury's failure to charge a specific drug quantity in the indictment, nor did he challenge the district court's failure to submit the issue of drug quantity to the jury to decide beyond a reasonable doubt. At sentencing, he objected to the quantity of drugs the district court used in its calculation.</p>\n<p>We have held that merely objecting to the quantity of drugs is insufficient to preserve an <i>Apprendi</i> claim. <i>United States v. Terry,</i> 240 F.3d 65, 72-73 &amp; n. 7 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. LaFreniere,</i> 236 F.3d 41, 48 (1st Cir.2001). Thus, we review Portes's <i>Apprendi</i> claim for plain error under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b). Under such review, \"`there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.'\" <i>United States v. Cotton,</i> 535 U.S. 625, 631, 122 S.Ct. 1781, 152 L.Ed.2d 860 (2002) (quoting <i>Johnson v. United States,</i> 520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted)). If such an error has occurred, we may then \"`exercise [our] discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if . . . the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Johnson,</i> 520 U.S. at 467, 117 S.Ct. 1544).</p>\n<p>The punishment for a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a) and § 846 varies in relation to the quantity of controlled substance involved in the violation. If the violation involved more than one kilogram of heroin, the sentencing exposure is ten years to life imprisonment. <i>Id.</i> § 841(b)(1)(A). If the violation involved more than one hundred grams of heroin, the statute provides a mandatory minimum of five years' imprisonment and a maximum of forty years' imprisonment. For all other quantities of heroin, the \"default\" provision establishes a statutory maximum of twenty years' imprisonment. <i>Id.</i> § 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p>The district court sentenced Portes to thirty years' imprisonment. However, none of the three heroin counts in the indictment included a specific allegation of drug quantity. Consequently, the jury was not asked to find any specific quantity of heroin, leaving Portes subject, on the basis of the jury verdict, only to the \"default\" statutory maximum sentence of twenty years. As the government correctly concedes, this omission meets the first two prongs of plain error review: there was an error in formulating Portes's sentence, and that error was obvious in light of <i>Apprendi. See </i><i>Cotton,</i> 535 U.S. at 632, 122 S.Ct. 1781.</p>\n<p>We need not decide whether this error affected Portes's substantial rights under the third prong of plain error review because, in any event, the error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. This case is strikingly similar to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> Supreme Court's decision in <i>Cotton.</i> There, the defendants challenged their sentences on the ground that the indictment charging them with conspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute did not allege the threshold drug quantity necessary to apply an enhanced statutory penalty. <i>Id.</i> at 628, 122 S.Ct. 1781. Although the defendants thus should have been subject to a \"default\" twenty-year statutory maximum, the district court sentenced them to thirty years' imprisonment because evidence introduced at trial demonstrated that the conspiracy involved a sufficient quantity of cocaine base to qualify for an increased maximum. <i>Id.</i> The defendants did not object at trial or at sentencing to the lack of a specific allegation of drug quantity. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Applying plain error review, the Supreme Court explained that, \"even assuming [defendants'] substantial rights were affected, the error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 632-33, 122 S.Ct. 1781. The Court upheld the sentence on the ground that the evidence that the drug quantity exceeded the level required for enhancement was \"overwhelming\" and \"essentially uncontroverted,\" explaining that \"[s]urely the grand jury, having found the conspiracy existed, would have also found that the conspiracy involved\" the requisite drug quantity. <i>Id.</i> at 633, 122 S.Ct. 1781; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Terry,</i> 240 F.3d 65, 74-75 (1st Cir.2001)(holding, in the alternative, that the failure to charge the relevant drug quantities in the indictment was not plain error where the \"uncontested testimony of a DEA chemist at trial established the quantities and types of the drugs\" and \"[t]here is no question that the petit jury in this case would have found [the defendant's] offenses to involve\" the requisite amount for an increased statutory maximum).</p>\n<p>As in <i>Cotton,</i> the evidence regarding the drug quantity for which Portes was responsible was \"overwhelming\" and \"essentially uncontroverted.\" Considerable evidence supported the fact that more than one hundred grams of heroin (the amount necessary to increase the maximum sentence to forty years under § 841(b)(1)(B)) were involved in each of the relevant charges. With respect to Count Five, there was no dispute that the Buick contained 251.3 grams of heroin. With respect to the conspiracy charge, the total amount of heroin that the agent purchased from Matos and the heroin seized from the Buick and One Wayne Terrace undisputedly totaled over five hundred grams. Indeed, the drug ledgers introduced into evidence at trial and the cooperating witnesses' testimony indicated that the total amount of heroin in fact was over one kilogram, which would have raised the maximum sentence to life imprisonment under § 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>Although Portes actively challenged the government's case against him, he focused on whether he committed the offenses and not on the drug quantities at issue. For example, Portes argued that he was not involved in the drug transactions and that the Buick was not his. However, he did not contend that the heroin found in the Buick and at One Wayne Terrace weighed less than the government claimed.<sup>[5]</sup> We thus think that the situation here is analogous to <i>Cotton.</i> Given that the jury found <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> Portes guilty of the charged offenses, it also would have found that his crimes involved the uncontroverted drug amounts found in the Buick and at One Wayne Terrace and purchased by the undercover agent.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, the court's reliance on this drug quantity in sentencing did not impair the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. We therefore conclude that there was no plain error in the district court's decision to sentence Portes to thirty years' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Booker</i> Error</p>\n<p>Portes also contends that, by sentencing him under a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines regime, the district court violated <i>Booker,</i> 543 U.S. 220, 125 S.Ct. 738, which held that the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory. To preserve this claim for appeal, a defendant must have raised and argued error under <i>Apprendi,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, or <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), or challenged the constitutionality of a mandatory Guidelines regime. <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir.2005). Portes raised none of these arguments before the district court, and so we review his claim for plain error. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We have held that a defendant has met the first two prongs of plain error review if, as here, the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory. <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. However, Portes has failed to meet the third prong of plain error review by demonstrating that this error affected his substantial rights. <i>See </i><i>Johnson,</i> 520 U.S. at 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544. This prong places the burden on a defendant alleging a <i>Booker</i> error to \"point to circumstances creating a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new `advisory Guidelines' <i>Booker</i> regime.\" <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. Portes has alleged no such circumstances. Nothing in the record indicates that the district court was troubled by the sentence it imposed or that it would have imposed a lower sentence if the Guidelines had been advisory at that time. Indeed, Portes's <i>Booker</i> claim rests largely on his <i>Apprendi</i> claim that the court plainly erred in sentencing him above the \"default\" statutory maximum. Since we have ruled against him on that claim, the record is devoid of anything suggesting a \"reasonable probability\" that the district court would impose a sentence more favorable to Portes. Thus, we find no plain error in the district court's application of a mandatory Guidelines sentencing scheme.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the aformentioned reasons, we <i>affirm</i> Portes's sentence.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  These former employees also were charged with various drug offenses, but pled guilty rather than go to trial.</p>\n<p>[2]  Nine defendants were charged in the original indictment, of whom only Portes and Julio Santana went to trial. Jorge Luis Diaz-Mejia, Nelson Marrero-Morrel, Hector Mena-Perez, and Elso Valverde pled guilty and, as noted, testified for the government at trial. Matos, Luis Adolfo Diaz, and Mayra Lopez pled guilty but were not involved in Portes's trial. Santana was tried separately in March 1996 for conspiracy to possess cocaine base with the intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, but the district court declared a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Following a second trial, Santana was convicted on all counts in April 1996, but we reversed his conviction in May 1999, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Santana,</i> 175 F.3d 57 (1st Cir.1999). Santana subsequently pled guilty in November 1999. A tenth defendant, Eduardo Perez, was identified following the filing of the original indictment, charged in the second superseding indictment, and subsequently entered a guilty plea.</p>\n<p>[3]  Portes did not request such an instruction.</p>\n<p>[4]  The five witnesses included the four who testified at Portes's trial as well as Eduardo Perez.</p>\n<p>[5]  Indeed, Portes himself, in his objection to the PSR, stated that the amount of heroin attributable to him should be only that associated with \"the specific offenses that he was charged with in the indictment.\" The amount associated with those specific offenses consists of the 251.3 grams found in the Buick and the 14.5 grams found at One Wayne Terrace.</p>\n<p>[6]  Portes did argue at sentencing that the cooperating witnesses' testimony about the drug quantities was unreliable, and that the drug ledgers also were unreliable because they did not clearly differentiate between cocaine and heroin amounts. However, even if we wholly disregard that evidence in calculating the amount of drugs, the uncontroverted amounts found in the Buick and at One Wayne Terrace and purchased by the undercover agent total well in excess of the one hundred grams necessary to increase the statutory maximum to forty years' imprisonment.</p>\n\n</div>",

We reject both claims  the former due to the overwhelming and essentially uncontroverted evidence of the requisite quantity of drugs, and the latter because Portes has failed to demonstrate a reasonable likelihood that the district court would impose a different sentence under an advisory Guidelines regime. Consequently, we affirm Portes's sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>A. Factual Background</p>\n<p>In 1994, the Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") began an investigation of a heroin distribution organization that Portes operated. At trial, four of Portes's former employees (Jorge Luis Diaz-Mejia, Nelson Marrero-Morrel, Hector Mena-Perez, and Elso Valverde), who had agreed to cooperate with the government, testified about the mechanics of the organization.<sup>[1]</sup> One participant would drive from Worcester, Massachusetts to New York once or twice a week to retrieve drugs from a contact there. The cash to purchase the drugs would be transported to New York in a secret compartment in the Buick; the drugs would be placed in that compartment on the return trip. Back in Worcester, the participants would weigh and package the heroin at various locations, including Portes's residence at 47 Florence Street; a room at the Clarion Suites Hotel rented in the name of Junior Pena, one of Portes's aliases; a space leased at One Wayne Terrace; and the residence of Rodolfo Matos, another of Portes's employees. Law enforcement agents surveilled all these locations at various times. They also rented a room across the hall from the room at the Clarion Suites Hotel, from which they observed most of the participants in the conspiracy arriving at and leaving the room, sometimes putting items into their pockets.</p>\n<p>The four cooperating witnesses testified that Portes employed them in processing and distributing the heroin. They performed tasks such as sealing envelopes containing heroin, using a press to make one ounce tablets of heroin, and delivering packages of heroin to customers. Mena-Perez testified that Portes kept ledgers recording the amount of heroin delivered to various customers and the amount of money those customers owed.</p>\n<p>A DEA special agent, acting in an undercover capacity, arranged to purchase heroin from Matos on five occasions. On January 24, 1995, the agent met Matos at 16 Svea Street in Worcester and paid him $7,400 for two ounces (55.1 grams) of heroin in a compressed, tablet form wrapped in red and white paper and tape. On February 23, the agent met Matos at Matos's residence in Worcester and paid him $11,400 for three ounces (84.3 grams) of heroin. Prior to this meeting, Matos went to Portes's residence; shortly thereafter, Marrero-Morel and Valverde went to the Clarion Suites Hotel for about five minutes, then returned to Portes's residence. Matos then returned to his own residence.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> On May 2, the agent purchased two ounces (55.7 grams) of heroin from Matos for $7,600 while they sat in a white Buick LeSabre. Matos retrieved the heroin from a secret compartment in the glove compartment of the car. Prior to this transaction, Matos went to Portes's residence, where he met Portes, Mena-Perez, and Ruben Perez. After exiting Portes's residence, Matos and Perez entered the Buick, which was parked outside, and Perez appeared to \"fiddle\" with the glove compartment area. Perez then got out of the car and Matos drove to meet the agent in the Buick.</p>\n<p>On June 1, the agent met Matos at the Auburn Mall in Worcester and paid him $7,600 for two ounces (56.1 grams) of heroin. At that time the agent indicated that he wished to purchase a larger quantity of heroin for a discounted price. Subsequently, the agent and Matos negotiated over the phone for the sale of eight ounces of heroin for $29,600. Diaz-Mejia testified that, on August 10, he saw Portes wrapping and sealing nine one-ounce tablets of heroin inside One Wayne Terrace. The planned transaction never occurred because most of the defendants were arrested that day. However, in executing search warrants, law enforcement agents seized nine ounces (251.3 grams) of heroin from the hidden compartment of the Buick. They also seized a large quantity of drug paraphernalia from One Wayne Terrace, much of which contained trace amounts of heroin, and a bag containing 14.5 grams of heroin in a powdered form.</p>\n<p>B. Procedural History</p>\n<p>The second superseding indictment, returned on June 6, 1996, brought various charges relating to the heroin distribution organization against Portes and his codefendants.<sup>[2]</sup> Three counts were relevant to Portes. Count One charged Portes and various others with conspiracy to possess heroin with intent to distribute, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and § 846. Count Four charged Portes with the possession of heroin with the intent to distribute it on August 10, 1995, in connection with the \"alleged heroin found at One Wayne Terrace,\" in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1). Count Five charged Portes with possession, and aiding and abetting Mena-Perez's possession of, heroin on August 10, 1995, with the intent to distribute it, in connection with the \"heroin allegedly found in the white Buick LeSabre,\" in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2. On these three counts, the indictment did not include any specific allegations with respect to the quantity of drugs involved.</p>\n<p>At trial, the district court did not instruct the jury that it must find any specific quantity of drugs.<sup>[3]</sup> Indeed, its instructions stated: \"If you find that the material involved is heroin, beyond a reasonable <span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> doubt, you need not be concerned about the quantity.\" The jury returned a guilty verdict on the three drug counts related to Portes.</p>\n<p>The Presentence Report (\"PSR\") stated that Portes was responsible for an amount of heroin between ten and thirty kilograms, resulting in a base offense level of thirty-six. The PSR added several enhancements: two levels for the gun found at One Wayne Terrace, under U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1); four levels because Portes was a leader of a criminal activity involving five or more participants, under U.S.S.G. § 3B1.1(a); and two levels for obstructing justice due to Portes's threats to cooperating defendants, under U.S.S.G. § 3C1.1. After totaling these enhancements, the PSR concluded that Portes was subject to the maximum offense level of forty-three. The PSR also established the sentencing range for each offense: a ten-year mandatory minimum and a statutory maximum of life imprisonment on Count One; a maximum of twenty years' imprisonment on Count Four; and a five-year mandatory minimum and a statutory maximum of forty years on Count Five.</p>\n<p>Portes objected to the drug quantity stated in the PSR, contending that, \"based upon the testimony at the trial, it is impossible to calculate the quantity of heroin attributed to him to be in the range of 10 kilograms.\" He contended that the only heroin attributable to him should be the amount related to \"the specific offenses that he was charged with in the indictment.\"</p>\n<p>Prior to sentencing Portes, the district court conducted a four-day evidentiary hearing. The government presented testimony from five cooperating witnesses,<sup>[4]</sup> who testified regarding the amount of heroin involved in Portes's offenses; and from a DEA special agent, who testified that, based on his review of the drug ledgers, the statements of the nine cooperating defendants, the heroin seized, and the heroin purchased, the conspiracy involved a total of 21,584 grams of heroin. Portes contested this drug quantity calculation, disputing the credibility of the government's cooperating witnesses as to drug quantity and arguing that the amount in question was \"less than ten kilograms.\"</p>\n<p>The court concluded that Portes was responsible for more than three kilograms of heroin \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" and for seven to eight kilograms of heroin \"by a preponderance of the evidence.\" In making these determinations, the court relied on the heroin seized from One Wayne Terrace and the Buick, the heroin that Matos sold to the undercover agent, and the heroin listed in the drug ledgers (which the court discounted somewhat because the ledgers included entries for cocaine as well as heroin transactions). The court stated that it did not rely on the cooperating witnesses' testimony in making these determinations. Based on this drug quantity, the court determined that Portes's base offense level was thirty-four; after applying the enhancements described in the PSR, his total offense level was forty-two. It then sentenced him to thirty years' imprisonment on Counts One and Five and twenty years' imprisonment on Count Four, to be served concurrently. It also sentenced Portes to five years of supervised release on each count, to be served concurrently, and ordered him to pay a $1 million fine. Portes now appeals this sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> II.</h2>\n<p>Portes raises two claims on appeal. First, he argues that the district court's reliance on drug quantities that were not found by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt violated <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">435</span></a></span> (2000). Second, he contends that the district court treated the Sentencing Guidelines as mandatory, in violation of <i>United States v. Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005).</p>\n<p>A. <i>Apprendi</i> Error</p>\n<p>In <i>Apprendi,</i> the Supreme Court held that \"[o]ther than the fact of a prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a reasonable doubt.\" 530 U.S. at 490, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2348</span></a></span>. Portes was convicted and sentenced four years prior to this decision. He did not challenge the grand jury's failure to charge a specific drug quantity in the indictment, nor did he challenge the district court's failure to submit the issue of drug quantity to the jury to decide beyond a reasonable doubt. At sentencing, he objected to the quantity of drugs the district court used in its calculation.</p>\n<p>We have held that merely objecting to the quantity of drugs is insufficient to preserve an <i>Apprendi</i> claim. <i>United States v. Terry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772069\"><a href=\"/opinion/772069/united-states-v-kenneth-b-terry-aka-kenny-polo/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 72-73 &amp; n. 7 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v.

Thus, we review Portes's <i>Apprendi</i> claim for plain error under Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 52(b). Under such review, \"`there must be (1) error, (2) that is plain, and (3) that affects substantial rights.'\" <i>United States v. Cotton,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">625</span></a></span>, 631, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">860</span></a></span> (2002) (quoting <i>Johnson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">520</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">461</span></a></span>, 466-67, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span> (1997) (internal quotation marks omitted)). If such an error has occurred, we may then \"`exercise [our] discretion to notice a forfeited error, but only if . . . the error seriously affects the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Johnson,</i> 520 U.S. at 467, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1544</span></a></span>).</p>\n<p>The punishment for a violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a) and § 846 varies in relation to the quantity of controlled substance involved in the violation. If the violation involved more than one kilogram of heroin, the sentencing exposure is ten years to life imprisonment. <i>Id.</i> § 841(b)(1)(A). If the violation involved more than one hundred grams of heroin, the statute provides a mandatory minimum of five years' imprisonment and a maximum of forty years' imprisonment. For all other quantities of heroin, the \"default\" provision establishes a statutory maximum of twenty years' imprisonment. <i>Id.</i> § 841(b)(1)(C).</p>\n<p>The district court sentenced Portes to thirty years' imprisonment. However, none of the three heroin counts in the indictment included a specific allegation of drug quantity. Consequently, the jury was not asked to find any specific quantity of heroin, leaving Portes subject, on the basis of the jury verdict, only to the \"default\" statutory maximum sentence of twenty years. As the government correctly concedes, this omission meets the first two prongs of plain error review: there was an error in formulating Portes's sentence, and that error was obvious in light of <i>Apprendi. See </i><i>Cotton,</i> 535 U.S. at 632, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1781</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>We need not decide whether this error affected Portes's substantial rights under the third prong of plain error review because, in any event, the error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. This case is strikingly similar to the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> Supreme Court's decision in <i>Cotton.</i> There, the defendants challenged their sentences on the ground that the indictment charging them with conspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute did not allege the threshold drug quantity necessary to apply an enhanced statutory penalty. <i>Id.</i> at 628, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1781</span></a></span>. Although the defendants thus should have been subject to a \"default\" twenty-year statutory maximum, the district court sentenced them to thirty years' imprisonment because evidence introduced at trial demonstrated that the conspiracy involved a sufficient quantity of cocaine base to qualify for an increased maximum. <i>Id.</i> The defendants did not object at trial or at sentencing to the lack of a specific allegation of drug quantity. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Applying plain error review, the Supreme Court explained that, \"even assuming [defendants'] substantial rights were affected, the error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> at 632-33, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1781</span></a></span>. The Court upheld the sentence on the ground that the evidence that the drug quantity exceeded the level required for enhancement was \"overwhelming\" and \"essentially uncontroverted,\" explaining that \"[s]urely the grand jury, having found the conspiracy existed, would have also found that the conspiracy involved\" the requisite drug quantity. <i>Id.</i> at 633, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118505\"><a href=\"/opinion/118505/united-states-v-cotton/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1781</span></a></span>; <i>see also </i><i>United States v. Terry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"772069\"><a href=\"/opinion/772069/united-states-v-kenneth-b-terry-aka-kenny-polo/\"><span class=\"volume\">240</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">65</span></a></span>, 74-75 (1st Cir.2001)(holding, in the alternative, that the failure to charge the relevant drug quantities in the indictment was not plain error where the \"uncontested testimony of a DEA chemist at trial established the quantities and types of the drugs\" and \"[t]here is no question that the petit jury in this case would have found [the defendant's] offenses to involve\" the requisite amount for an increased statutory maximum).</p>\n<p>As in <i>Cotton,</i> the evidence regarding the drug quantity for which Portes was responsible was \"overwhelming\" and \"essentially uncontroverted.\" Considerable evidence supported the fact that more than one hundred grams of heroin (the amount necessary to increase the maximum sentence to forty years under § 841(b)(1)(B)) were involved in each of the relevant charges. With respect to Count Five, there was no dispute that the Buick contained 251.3 grams of heroin. With respect to the conspiracy charge, the total amount of heroin that the agent purchased from Matos and the heroin seized from the Buick and One Wayne Terrace undisputedly totaled over five hundred grams. Indeed, the drug ledgers introduced into evidence at trial and the cooperating witnesses' testimony indicated that the total amount of heroin in fact was over one kilogram, which would have raised the maximum sentence to life imprisonment under § 841(b)(1)(A).</p>\n<p>Although Portes actively challenged the government's case against him, he focused on whether he committed the offenses and not on the drug quantities at issue. For example, Portes argued that he was not involved in the drug transactions and that the Buick was not his. However, he did not contend that the heroin found in the Buick and at One Wayne Terrace weighed less than the government claimed.<sup>[5]</sup> We thus think that the situation here is analogous to <i>Cotton.</i> Given that the jury found <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> Portes guilty of the charged offenses, it also would have found that his crimes involved the uncontroverted drug amounts found in the Buick and at One Wayne Terrace and purchased by the undercover agent.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Thus, the court's reliance on this drug quantity in sentencing did not impair the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the judicial proceedings. We therefore conclude that there was no plain error in the district court's decision to sentence Portes to thirty years' imprisonment.</p>\n<p>B. <i>Booker</i> Error</p>\n<p>Portes also contends that, by sentencing him under a mandatory Sentencing Guidelines regime, the district court violated <i>Booker,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, which held that the Sentencing Guidelines are advisory rather than mandatory. To preserve this claim for appeal, a defendant must have raised and argued error under <i>Apprendi,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2348</span></a></span>, or <i>Blakely v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">542</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">296</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2531</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"136995\"><a href=\"/opinion/136995/blakely-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">403</span></a></span> (2004), or challenged the constitutionality of a mandatory Guidelines regime. <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir.2005). Portes raised none of these arguments before the district court, and so we review his claim for plain error. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>We have held that a defendant has met the first two prongs of plain error review if, as here, the district court treated the Guidelines as mandatory rather than advisory. <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. However, Portes has failed to meet the third prong of plain error review by demonstrating that this error affected his substantial rights. <i>See </i><i>Johnson,</i> 520 U.S. at 466-67, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118106\"><a href=\"/opinion/118106/johnson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1544</span></a></span>. This prong places the burden on a defendant alleging a <i>Booker</i> error to \"point to circumstances creating a reasonable probability that the district court would impose a different sentence more favorable to the defendant under the new `advisory Guidelines' <i>Booker</i> regime.\" <i>Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d at 75. Portes has alleged no such circumstances. Nothing in the record indicates that the district court was troubled by the sentence it imposed or that it would have imposed a lower sentence if the Guidelines had been advisory at that time. Indeed, Portes's <i>Booker</i> claim rests largely on his <i>Apprendi</i> claim that the court plainly erred in sentencing him above the \"default\" statutory maximum. Since we have ruled against him on that claim, the record is devoid of anything suggesting a \"reasonable probability\" that the district court would impose a sentence more favorable to Portes. Thus, we find no plain error in the district court's application of a mandatory Guidelines sentencing scheme.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III.</h2>\n<p>For the aformentioned reasons, we <i>affirm</i> Portes's sentence.</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  These former employees also were charged with various drug offenses, but pled guilty rather than go to trial.</p>\n<p>[2]  Nine defendants were charged in the original indictment, of whom only Portes and Julio Santana went to trial. Jorge Luis Diaz-Mejia, Nelson Marrero-Morrel, Hector Mena-Perez, and Elso Valverde pled guilty and, as noted, testified for the government at trial. Matos, Luis Adolfo Diaz, and Mayra Lopez pled guilty but were not involved in Portes's trial. Santana was tried separately in March 1996 for conspiracy to possess cocaine base with the intent to distribute it, in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 846, but the district court declared a mistrial after the jury was unable to reach a verdict. Following a second trial, Santana was convicted on all counts in April 1996, but we reversed his conviction in May 1999, <i>see </i><i>United States v. Santana,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763557\"><a href=\"/opinion/763557/united-states-v-julio-c-santana/\"><span class=\"volume\">175</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1999). Santana subsequently pled guilty in November 1999. A tenth defendant, Eduardo Perez, was identified following the filing of the original indictment, charged in the second superseding indictment, and subsequently entered a guilty plea.</p>\n<p>[3]  Portes did not request such an instruction.</p>\n<p>[4]  The five witnesses included the four who testified at Portes's trial as well as Eduardo Perez.</p>\n<p>[5]  Indeed, Portes himself, in his objection to the PSR, stated that the amount of heroin attributable to him should be only that associated with \"the specific offenses that he was charged with in the indictment.\" The amount associated with those specific offenses consists of the 251.3 grams found in the Buick and the 14.5 grams found at One Wayne Terrace.</p>\n<p>[6]  Portes did argue at sentencing that the cooperating witnesses' testimony about the drug quantities was unreliable, and that the drug ledgers also were unreliable because they did not clearly differentiate between cocaine and heroin amounts. However, even if we wholly disregard that evidence in calculating the amount of drugs, the uncontroverted amounts found in the Buick and at One Wayne Terrace and purchased by the undercover agent total well in excess of the one hundred grams necessary to increase the statutory maximum to forty years' imprisonment.</p>\n\n</div>",
