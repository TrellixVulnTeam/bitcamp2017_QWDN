Following a five-day trial, a\n\njury convicted defendant-appellant Wanda Llinas of both conspiracy\n\nto possess narcotics with intent to distribute and intentional use\n\nof a communication device in facilitating the conspiracy.            Llinas\n\nnow   appeals   these     convictions,        alleging   that   there     was\n\n(1)   insufficient    evidence   to    support    the    verdicts   and   (2)\n\nreversible error arising out of the district court's decision to\n\nadmit certain evidence in violation of Rule 12.1(b) of the Federal\n\nRules of Criminal Procedure.      We affirm.\n\n                                      I.\n\n           We recite the relevant facts in the light most favorable\n\nto the verdicts.     See United States v. Echeverri, 982 F.2d 675, 676\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).\n\n           Daniel Sanchez and Wilson Martínez Cotto became friends\n\nin or about January 2000, and, within a few days, Sanchez began\n\nselling heroin to Martínez for distribution.              Soon thereafter,\n\nSanchez told Martínez about a recent encounter he had had with a\n\nman called \"Guillermo,\" who had proposed that Sanchez visit Puerto\n\nRico to conduct some drug deals. Martínez was interested. Neither\n\nSanchez nor Martínez was aware that Guillermo was a government\n\ninformant.\n\n           In June 2000, Sanchez and Martínez traveled together to\n\nPuerto Rico, where Sanchez was to introduce Martínez to Guillermo.\n\nFor his part, Martínez tended to the lodging details, initially\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\farranging for the pair to stay at a relative's house.                           After\n\narriving in Puerto Rico, however, these initial arrangements fell\n\nthrough.    In search of a place to stay, Martínez then phoned\n\nLlinas's stepfather, a family friend, and arranged for the men to\n\nstay at his house.      Llinas lived with her stepfather.\n\n           On June 16th, Llinas drove Sanchez and Martínez to a\n\nnearby bakery. While Llinas waited in her car with her stepfather,\n\nSanchez and Martínez entered the bakery and met with Guillermo and\n\nhis   partner,    Carrasquillo,       an   undercover      agent    for   the    Drug\n\nEnforcement      Administration.           There,    the    men     negotiated      a\n\ntransaction in which Martínez agreed to provide, on a later date,\n\ntwo kilograms      of   heroin   in    exchange     for    eleven   kilograms      of\n\ncocaine.\n\n           Approximately one-half hour after entering the bakery,\n\nSanchez and Martínez exited, and Llinas drove them back to her\n\nstepfather's home.       Having earned his commission by introducing\n\nMartínez to Guillermo, Sanchez departed Puerto Rico.\n\n           Martínez did not hear from Carrasquillo until June 30th,\n\nwhen they spoke via cellular telephone.             During the course of this\n\ncoded-language conversation, Martínez informed Carrasquillo that\n\n\"at hand, I have one and a half . . . then by Sunday, I'll have\n\nanother two . . . it would be three and a half.\"              The men agreed to\n\n\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fexchange the drugs –- or, as Martínez put it, \"cook the goose\" –-\n\non July 3rd.1\n\n           On   the   morning   of     July   3rd,   Martínez   contacted\n\nCarrasquillo to arrange the meeting for that day.           A few hours\n\nlater, in Llinas's presence, Martínez again phoned Carrasquillo and\n\ninformed him that he \"went by the office and [] picked the papers\n\nup there with the, the, stamps on them and all that . . . .\"          The\n\nmen then agreed to meet at the parking lot of El Comandante\n\nracetrack between 4:00 and 4:30 p.m.             At this point in the\n\nconversation, Martínez handed Llinas the cellular phone to receive\n\ndirections to the racetrack.\n\n           According to Llinas, Martínez had asked her to drop him\n\noff at the racetrack, where he was to meet a friend who would pick\n\nhim up.    After dropping Martínez off, Llinas and her boyfriend,\n\nJosé Arroyo, planned on driving to the beach for the Fourth-of-July\n\nholiday.\n\n           On the way to the racetrack, Llinas and Martínez picked\n\nup Arroyo in a rental car that Arroyo allegedly had rented for the\n\nweekend.   They subsequently made a quick stop at a supermarket to\n\npurchase provisions for the beach.         While Llinas and Arroyo were\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Pointing to background voices that can be heard on Agent\nCarrasquillo's tape-recording of the June 30th conversation, the\ngovernment repeatedly asserts in its brief that Llinas was present\nduring this dialogue. We cannot conclude that this assertion is\nsupported by the record; accordingly, we will not consider it.\n\n                                     -4-\n\finside, Martínez waited in the parking lot and made two additional\n\ncalls to Carrasquillo.\n\n           Having completed this errand, the trio set off for the\n\nrendezvous at the racetrack.      Martínez was driving; Arroyo was in\n\nthe passenger seat and Llinas was in the back.              Next to Llinas in\n\nthe backseat were two cellular telephone boxes stacked inside a\n\nlarge plastic bag.     The boxes contained plastic bags filled with\n\n1787 grams of heroin.\n\n           At   approximately    4:30    p.m.,     they      arrived    at   the\n\nracetrack's parking lot.        Martínez parked the car, exited, and\n\napproached   Carrasquillo.      Llinas     and    Arroyo    remained    inside.\n\nAccording to Llinas's testimony, Martínez had asked them to wait\n\n\"because he was going to decide where he was going with his\n\nfriend.\"\n\n           Upon agreeing with Carrasquillo to proceed with the\n\nexchange, Martínez walked over to the car, opened the rear door,\n\nand asked Llinas to hand him the bag next to her.                 According to\n\nLlinas, after    she   handed   Martínez    the    bag     that   she   believed\n\ncontained cellular telephones, she \"asked him whether we could\n\nleave yet and he said no because the friend that was going to pick\n\nhim up hadn't arrived yet.\"      Carrasquillo and Martínez then moved\n\nto the back of the car to inspect the bag's contents.             Once certain\n\nthat the boxes contained a heroin-like substance, Carrasquillo\n\nsignaled for the arrest of Martínez, Llinas, and Arroyo.\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f          On July 26, 2000, Llinas was arraigned on a three-count\n\nindictment.   Count I charged Llinas, Arroyo and Martínez with\n\nconspiracy with the intent to possess and distribute two kilograms\n\nof a substance containing a detectable amount of heroin and five\n\nkilograms of a substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine,\n\nin violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1); Count II charged Llinas and\n\nher co-defendants with aiding and abetting possession with the\n\nintent to distribute approximately two kilograms of heroin, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. § 2; and Count III\n\ncharged Llinas and Martínez with aiding and abetting each other in\n\nusing a communication facility to facilitate the conspiracy, in\n\nviolation of 21 U.S.C. § 843(b) and 18 U.S.C. § 2.\n\n          On November 21, 2000, a joint trial began; Llinas and\n\nArroyo were co-defendants.2   On November 28, 2000, a jury found\n\nLlinas guilty on Counts I and III and not guilty on Count II.\n\nArroyo was acquitted on all counts.       On April 24, 2001, the\n\ndistrict court sentenced Llinas to concurrent prison terms of 123\n\nmonths for Count I and 24 months for Count III, three years of\n\nsupervised release, and $200 in special assessments.\n\n          This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Prior to trial, Martínez had entered a guilty plea.\nNotwithstanding his cooperation with the government, Martínez did\nnot testify at Llinas's trial.\n\n                               -6-\n\f                                     II.\n\n           We are presented with two issues on appeal: (1) whether\n\nthere was sufficient evidence to support Llinas's convictions; and\n\n(2) whether the district court erred when it allowed the government\n\nto introduce certain documents and testimony, neither of which were\n\nnoticed to Llinas as allegedly required by Rule 12.1(b) of the\n\nFederal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\n\n           Given these separate issues, two standards of review\n\napply.    First, in deciding sufficiency challenges, \"we review all\n\nthe   evidence,    direct   and    circumstantial,    in    the   light     most\n\nfavorable to the prosecution, drawing all reasonable inferences\n\nconsistent with the verdict, and avoiding credibility judgments, to\n\ndetermine whether a rational jury could have found guilt beyond a\n\nreasonable doubt.\"3    United States v. Baltas, 236 F.3d 27, 35 (1st\n\nCir. 2001); see also United States v. Ruiz, 105 F.3d 1492, 1495\n\n(1st Cir. 1997) (noting that \"we review de novo the defendants'\n\nchallenge to the evidentiary sufficiency of their convictions,\n\nconstruing   the   evidence   in    the    light   most    favorable   to   the\n\ngovernment\"). As to the second issue, because the district court's\n\n\n      3\n      Following the government's presentation of its case-in-chief,\nLlinas unsuccessfully moved for judgment of acquittal pursuant to\nRule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.          Llinas\nthereafter presented evidence in her defense, thus waiving review\nof her initial motion. See United States v. Ruiz, 105 F.3d 1492,\n1495 n.1 (1st Cir. 1997) (citing United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d\n288, 291 (1st Cir. 1992)).     Therefore, we review the evidence\npresented by Llinas during her case-in-chief in the light most\nfavorable to the verdicts. See Ruiz, 105 F.3d at 1495 n.1.\n\n                                     -7-\n\fdecision to admit the alibi-rebuttal evidence was based on its\n\nconstruction of Rule 12.1(b), we proceed de novo.                        See United\n\nStates v. Randazzo, 80 F.3d 623, 627 (1st Cir. 1996) (noting that,\n\nbecause the district court's rejection of a motion turned on its\n\nconstruction of a rule of criminal procedure, the court would\n\nreview     the   decision     de   novo);     see   also       United    States    v.\n\nEncarnacion, 239 F.3d 395, 397 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"We review de novo\n\nthe district court's construction of the Federal Rules of Criminal\n\nProcedure.\" (citation omitted)).\n\n            A.   Sufficiency of the Evidence\n\n            Llinas's     principal    argument      on    appeal    is    that    her\n\nconvictions should be reversed because there was insufficient\n\nevidence    at   trial   to   sustain    either     (1)    a   finding    that    she\n\nconspired to possess narcotics with the intent to distribute or (2)\n\na finding that she used a communication device to facilitate such\n\na conspiracy.     We disagree.\n\n(1) Conspiracy Count\n\n            Llinas contends that \"the evidence taken as a whole\n\nfailed to establish her knowing, intentional participation in the\n\ndrug conspiracy . . . beyond a reasonable doubt . . . .\"                          More\n\nspecifically, she argues that, \"[a]side from the total lack of\n\nevidence presented by the government concerning her knowledge and\n\ncriminal intent[,] there is a substantial amount of evidence that\n\nestablished that [she] did not know about [the conspiracy].\"\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\f          To prove the elements of the crime of\n          conspiracy, the government must show the\n          existence of a conspiracy, the defendant's\n          knowledge   of    the   conspiracy,    and  the\n          defendant's voluntary participation in the\n          conspiracy. More specifically, to establish\n          that a defendant belonged to and participated\n          in a conspiracy, the government must prove two\n          kinds of intent: intent to agree [with her co-\n          conspirators] and intent to commit the\n          substantive offense. Such proof may consist\n          of    circumstantial     evidence,    including\n          inferences from surrounding circumstances,\n          such as acts committed by the defendant that\n          furthered the conspiracy's purposes.        The\n          government   need   not   prove   that   a  co-\n          conspirator knew all of the details or\n          participated in all of the objectives of the\n          plan.\n\nUnited States v. Gomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d 847, 852-53 (1st Cir. 1990)\n\n(citations and quotation marks omitted); United States v. Nelson-\n\nRodriguez, 319 F.3d 12, 27 (1st Cir. 2003) (listing the \"three\n\nbasic components of a drug conspiracy\").\n\n          Because Llinas does not contest the existence of a\n\ncriminal conspiracy between Sanchez and Martínez,4 we consider only\n\nwhether the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt both that\n\nLlinas knew of the conspiracy and that she voluntarily participated\n\nin it.\n\n          It is clear from the record that Llinas engaged in\n\nactivity that would be illegal had she known about the Sanchez-\n\n\n     4\n      According to Llinas's brief, \"[f]rom the testimony of\nundercover agent Carrasquillo[,] the government established\nthat . . . [t]hey finally agreed to exchange 2 kilos of heroin to\nbe delivered by Sanchez and [Martínez] in exchange for 11 kilos of\ncocaine to be delivered by agent Carrasquillo.\"\n\n                               -9-\n\fMartínez conspiracy.        For example, Llinas testified that, on the\n\nday of the exchange, she picked up the boxed heroin from the\n\nbackseat of the car and handed it to Martínez.              This evidence alone\n\narguably is sufficient to prove voluntary participation in the\n\nconspiracy,     including     an     intent     to     commit   the   underlying\n\nsubstantive offense, if Llinas knew that drugs were in the box.\n\n            Llinas's conviction, then, turns on the question of when,\n\nif ever, she gained knowledge of the conspiracy.                   At trial, no\n\ndirect evidence      was   presented       on   this   issue;   instead,    as    is\n\npermissible, the jury inferred knowledge from the government's\n\ncircumstantial      evidence.        See   Gomez-Pabon,      911   F.2d    at    853\n\n(\"[P]roof     may   consist     of   circumstantial       evidence,    including\n\ninferences from surrounding circumstances, such as acts committed\n\nby   the   defendant   that     furthered       the    conspiracy's   purposes.\"\n\n(citations omitted)); see also United States v. Valerio, 48 F.3d\n\n58, 63 (1st Cir. 1995) (noting that \"the government's proof may lay\n\nentirely in circumstantial evidence\" (citation omitted and emphasis\n\nretained)).\n\n            Although the evidence is not overwhelming, we conclude\n\nthat the jury, having been properly instructed,5 could have found\n\nthat the evidence was sufficient to prove the requisite knowledge\n\nbeyond a reasonable doubt. The inference that Llinas was, in fact,\n\n      5\n      The district court instructed the jury, inter alia, that \"a\nperson who has no knowledge of a conspiracy, but happens to act in\na way that furthers some object or purpose of the conspiracy, does\nnot thereby become a conspirator.\"\n\n                                      -10-\n\fa knowing participant in the conspiracy is adequately supported by\n\nsubstantial circumstantial evidence together with evidence that\n\nLlinas testified untruthfully at trial.\n\n              First, there was substantial circumstantial evidence\n\nsuggesting that Llinas knew about the conspiracy.                        This evidence\n\ncan be summarized as follows: While in Puerto Rico, Sanchez and\n\nMartínez      stayed    with    Llinas       in    the   same   house;    despite    her\n\ntestimony to the contrary,6 Llinas drove Sanchez and Martínez to\n\ntheir      initial    meeting       with    Carrasquillo,       waited    in   the   car\n\napproximately one-half hour, and then drove them back to her\n\nstepfather's         home;    Llinas       was    present   when   Martínez     phoned\n\nCarrasquillo and spoke about the drug exchange (albeit in coded\n\nlanguage); on the day of the drug exchange, Martínez handed Llinas\n\nthe   telephone       so     that   she     could    receive    directions     to    the\n\nracetrack; Llinas agreed to provide the transportation to the\n\nracetrack in her boyfriend's rental car; after Llinas arrived at\n\nthe racetrack, an undercover agent allegedly observed her \"moving\n\n[her] head[] like looking for something\";7 when asked, Llinas\n\n      6\n          Llinas's potentially untruthful testimony is discussed below.\n      7\n      On cross-examination, however, the undercover agent suggested\nthat he might not have actually observed Llinas \"looking for\nsomething.\" After Arroyo's defense counsel established that the\nagent failed to note this particular observation in his\ninvestigative report, the following exchange occurred:\n\n      A: But you have got to remember that always, always in\n      all these transactions, when they arrive in a vehicle,\n      they all do the same. They are always looking around at\n      everything, and I never write those details in a\n\n                                            -11-\n\fhanded Martínez the drugs, which had been hidden in boxes next to\n\nher in the backseat; and, following confiscation of the heroin that\n\nwas placed in two Ericsson cellular telephone boxes, agents seized\n\ntwo Ericsson cellular telephones from the car.\n\n          Llinas responds to the government's evidence as follows:\n\n          It is obvious that from the evidence taken as\n          a whole . . . that [Martínez] used [Llinas] to\n          provide   him   with  transportation   without\n          [Llinas] having knowledge that he was engaged\n          in narcotics trafficking with Daniel Sanchez.\n          Whatever actions [Llinas] took in providing a\n          ride to [Martínez] and Sanchez on June 16 and\n          July 3, [they] were carried out without\n          criminal knowledge and intent.\n\n          We are unconvinced. While \"mere presence at the scene of\n\nthe crime\" or \"mere association with conspirators\" is not enough to\n\nestablish guilt, see Gomez-Pabon, 911 F.2d at 853, \"the mere\n\npresence defense is not so ubiquitous as to envelop every drug-\n\ntrafficking case in which the government lacks direct evidence of\n\na defendant's complicity.\"   Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 678.   See also\n\nUnited States v. Flores-Rivera, 56 F.3d 319, 324 (1st Cir. 1995)\n\n(\"Mere presence at the scene and close association with those\n\ninvolved are insufficient factors alone; nevertheless, they are\n\nrelevant factors for the jury.\" (quoting United States v.

DiMarzo, 80 F.3d 656, 661 (1st Cir. 1996) (citations\n\nomitted).     \"[S]uch is not normally the conduct that one would\n\nexpect of conspirators engaged in conduct which by its nature is\n\nkept secret from outsiders.\" United States v. Smith, 680 F.2d 255,\n\n260 (1st Cir. 1982).\n\n             Here, of course, Llinas was more than merely present. On\n\nat   least        one     occasion,     Llinas      provided       the       necessary\n\ntransportation.           And,   as   the   evidence      shows,   her      usefulness\n\nextended much further than the car.                First, Llinas alone had the\n\ndirections to the racetrack; but for her guidance, it is likely\n\nthat Martínez never would have arrived. Second, when asked, Llinas\n\npicked up the heroin that was next to her on the backseat and\n\nhanded it to Martínez; that the drugs were concealed within boxes\n\nis, of course, not enough to require a finding of reasonable doubt\n\nas to knowledge, since the jury was entitled to infer knowledge\n\nfrom the other circumstantial evidence.\n\n             In    addition      to    evidence     of     Llinas's      affirmative\n\ninvolvement       in    the   conspiracy,    the   government      also      presented\n\nevidence     showing      what    Llinas     did    not    do.        For    example,\n\nnotwithstanding her testimony that she planned to drop Martínez off\n\n\n\n                                        -13-\n\fat the racetrack and then leave for the beach, neither Llinas nor\n\nher boyfriend ever moved from their respective positions in the car\n\nto take Martínez's place in the driver's seat; instead, they\n\nremained at the racetrack and waited for Martínez. Having observed\n\nthese nonevents on the videotape of the arrest and having heard\n\nunrebutted testimony that the heroin was to be exchanged for eleven\n\nkilograms of cocaine, the jury was free to infer that the more\n\nlikely story was that Llinas and Martínez planned to leave the\n\nracetrack together, along with the cocaine for which they arrived\n\nin the first place.\n\n          On facts analogous to these, where the defendant-driver\n\nalleged not only that \"he had merely given [a conspirator] a ride\n\nand [had] not participate[d] in the drug sale\" but also that \"there\n\nwas no evidence that he could see what was in the box,\" we noted\n\nthat \"the jury could reasonably have inferred that under these\n\npotentially dangerous circumstances, an insider rather than an\n\noutsider would chauffeur the dealer.\"     United States v. Olivo-\n\nInfante, 938 F.2d 1406, 1409 (1st Cir. 1991).   So too in this case.\n\nSee Echeverri, 982 F.2d at 678 (\"[W]e require only that a jury's\n\nverdict be supportable, not that it be inevitable . . . .\").\n\n          Llinas, however, argues that \"the present case is akin to\n\nseveral appeals where this court has not hesitated to reverse\n\nconvictions on sufficiency grounds where the government failed to\n\nestablish that the actions taken by the defendant were made with\n\n\n\n                               -14-\n\fcriminal knowledge and intent\" (citing United States v. Francomano,\n\n554 F.2d 483 (1st Cir. 1977); United States v. Mehtala, 578 F.2d 6\n\n(1st Cir. 1978); United States v. Ocampo, 964 F.2d 80 (1st Cir.\n\n1992);   Valerio, 48 F.3d 58; United States v. de la Cruz-Paulino,\n\n61 F.3d 986 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v. Clotida, 892 F.2d\n\n1098 (1st Cir. 1989)).\n\n           These cases are inapposite because, unlike in this case,\n\nthe factfinder did not have evidence suggesting that the defendant\n\nhad lied on the witness stand.     In Francomano, for example, we\n\nbased our decision to vacate the conviction on findings that \"the\n\nGovernment made no case-in-chief and no testimony offered by the\n\n[defendants] strengthen[ed] the Government's case.\"    554 F.2d at\n\n487 (emphasis added).    We noted that, while a jury may sometimes\n\ninfer guilt from the mere fact that the defendant lied on the\n\nstand, \"we [could] detect no inconsistencies or other appropriate\n\nbasis for such an inference here.\"    Id. at 487-88.\n\n           Here, even if we were to assume that the government's\n\ncircumstantial evidence, taken alone, was insufficient to support\n\nan inference of knowledge, we cannot ignore the strong possibility\n\nthat the jury determined that Llinas had lied on the witness stand.\n\nAt trial, Llinas testified that she could not have driven Sanchez\n\nand Martínez to their meeting with Carrasquillo because she had\n\nbeen working on the day in question.    Not only did the government\n\npresent evidence in rebuttal suggesting that Llinas had not worked\n\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fthat day, it had also presented Sanchez's testimony that Llinas had\n\ndriven them to their meeting and Carrasquillo's corroborating\n\ntestimony that a woman fitting Llinas's description had driven the\n\ncar.\n\n           Having reason to doubt Llinas's credibility, the jury\n\nproperly     could    have   disregarded       all   of    Llinas's   testimony,\n\nincluding the beach-weekend explanation for her presence at the\n\nracetrack.    See United States v. Batista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 18\n\n(1st Cir. 1991) (noting that \"the district court's well-supported\n\nfinding that appellant gave materially false testimony . . .\n\nprovided a basis for discrediting other exculpatory testimony given\n\nby [appellant] in [her] own defense\" (citations omitted)).\n\n           Moreover, the jury properly could have used Llinas's\n\ntestimony, in conjunction with the government's circumstantial\n\nevidence, to bolster its inference of knowledge.                      See United\n\nStates v. Hadfield, 918 F.2d 987, 999 (1st Cir. 1990) (finding that\n\nan   inference   of    guilt   could    have    been      further   supported   by\n\ndefendant's \"tall tale\"); see also Ruiz, 105 F.3d 1492, 1500 (\"Lies\n\nsuch as these legitimately support a finding of guilt.\"); United\n\nStates v. Jimenez-Perez, 869 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"[I]f the\n\njury disbelieved defendants' story, it could legitimately have\n\npresumed that the fabrication was all the more proof of their\n\nguilt.\" (citation omitted)).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\f           In   sum,   having   thoroughly     examined      the    record,       we\n\nconclude that the jury had sufficient evidence from which to draw\n\nan inference of knowledge.8\n\n(2) Facilitation Count\n\n           Llinas next argues that \"the evidence presented by the\n\ngovernment    was   [in]sufficient     to   establish   that      [she]   .   .    .\n\nknowingly and intentionally used a telephone facility to promote\n\n[the] conspiracy.\"     She asserts that \"the same analysis . . . as to\n\nthe conspiracy count applies in the use of a telephone facility\n\ncharge.\"\n\n             The applicable criminal statute, 21 U.S.C. § 843(b),\n\nmakes it \"unlawful for any person knowingly or intentionally to use\n\nany   communication    facility   in    committing      or   in    causing        or\n\nfacilitating the commission of any act or acts constituting a\n\nfelony . . . .\" (emphasis added).\n\n           Because it is clear from the record that Llinas engaged\n\nin activity that would be illegal had she known about the Sanchez-\n\n\n      8\n      On the basis of the record before us, we have difficulty\nunderstanding the defense decision to provide unnecessary testimony\nregarding Llinas's whereabouts when such testimony easily could\nhave been –- and was -- contradicted. The important issue in the\ncase involved Llinas's knowledge (or lack thereof) -- not whether\nshe was driving the car on June 16th (especially given the\npermissible inference that she simply was providing a ride to a\nhouse guest).   But, Llinas has made no ineffective assistance of\ncounsel claim on direct appeal and, in any event, the record is not\nsufficiently clear to allow us to consider it in the first instance\n(in part because the record is silent as to counsel's rationale).\nAny further elaboration of the issue must thus await a motion for\nrelief under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n                                     -17-\n\fMartínez conspiracy, see, e.g., United States v. Tuesta-Toro, 29\n\nF.3d 771, 776 (1st Cir. 1994) (finding that two telephone calls\n\nbetween co-conspirators to arrange a drug deal was enough to prove\n\nfacilitation); United States v. Cordero, 668 F.2d 32, 43 & n.16\n\n(1st Cir. 1981)(rejecting defendant's two-pronged argument that,\n\nbecause she spoke only with a government agent and because she\n\nmerely was receiving rather than placing the call, she could not\n\nhave violated § 843(b)), Llinas's conviction again turns on whether\n\nshe knew about the conspiracy.        Having already addressed this\n\nissue, we need not provide further elaboration.\n\n          B.   Rule 12.1\n\n          Finally, Llinas argues that her convictions should be set\n\naside because \"the district court committed reversible error in\n\npermitting the government to present alibi rebuttal testimony and\n\ndocuments[, neither of] which were [] notified to appellant after\n\nshe served her notice of alibi as requested by the government\n\npursuant to Rule 12.1 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\"\n\nWe disagree.\n\n          When triggered, Rule 12.1 imposes disclosure obligations\n\non both the defendant and the government.    The applicable version\n\nof the rule provides, in pertinent part, as follows:9\n\n\n\n\n     9\n      Rule 12.1 was amended in 2002; the changes were primarily\nstylistic. See Fed. R. Crim. P. 12.1, advisory committee's note\n(2002).\n\n                               -18-\n\f           (a) Upon written demand of the attorney for\n           the government . . . [,] the defendant shall\n           serve . . . upon the attorney for the\n           government a written notice of the defendant's\n           intention to offer a defense of alibi. Such\n           notice by the defendant shall state the\n           specific place or places at which the\n           defendant claims to have been at the time of\n           the alleged offense and the names and\n           addresses of the witnesses upon whom the\n           defendant intends to rely to establish such\n           alibi.\n\n           (b) Within ten days thereafter, . . . the\n           attorney for the government shall serve upon\n           the defendant . . . a written notice stating\n           the names and addresses of the . . . witnesses\n           to be relied on to rebut testimony of any of\n           the defendant's alibi witnesses.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 12.1 (2000) (amended 2002) (headings omitted).\n\n           Here, the government triggered Llinas's obligation under\n\nRule   12.1(a)   when   it   filed   a   motion   requesting   \"notice   of\n\ndefendant's intention, if any, to offer the defense of alibi.\"           On\n\nOctober 20, 2000, Llinas complied with this request by filing a\n\n\"notice of alibi.\"      According to her notice, Llinas planned to\n\nintroduce evidence at trial establishing that, because she was\n\nworking on June 16, 2000, she could not have driven Martínez and\n\nSanchez to the bakery.       Specifically, she intended to introduce a\n\npaycheck stub (which was attached to the notice) and testimony from\n\na manager at the supermarket where she worked.        Llinas herself was\n\nnot listed as a witness.\n\n           Having fulfilled her obligation under Rule 12.1(a), the\n\ngovernment had a reciprocal obligation under Rule 12.1(b) to\n\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\frespond with a list of \"witnesses to be relied on to rebut\n\ntestimony    of    any   of    the   defendant's    alibi   witnesses.\"         Id.\n\n(emphasis added).        The government did not file such a response.\n\nWhether one was required is, of course, the dispositive question.\n\n            At trial, Llinas herself testified that she had not\n\ndriven Martínez and Sanchez to the bakery on the 16th –- a story\n\nthat defense counsel attempted to corroborate by offering into\n\nevidence a paycheck stub that allegedly placed Llinas at work on\n\nthe day in question.          During a sidebar conference following these\n\nevents,    the    government     informed      defense   counsel    that   it   had\n\nobtained payroll records from the supermarket that cast serious\n\ndoubt on the validity of Llinas's testimony.                Despite objection,\n\nthe   government     was      allowed   to     introduce    these     records    as\n\nimpeachment evidence through the testimony of the supermarket's\n\naccountant, who was called to authenticate the documents.10\n\n      10\n      The specific basis for the                district    court's    ruling   is\nembedded in the following exchange:\n\n      The Court: Why didn't you provide the name of this\n      witness to counsel?\n\n      The Government: At the time defendant took the stand and\n      decided to tell that she did work on the 16th of June, at\n      that point the matter was triggered, so at this point in\n      time, in open court and for the record, I told Brother\n      Counsel and I showed him the – a photocopy of the books\n      of [the supermarket]. And I immediately told my case\n      agent, 'Go get this man, because I am going to impeach\n      this witness.'\n\n      The Court: Well, [defense] counsel, the statement came\n      out in open court from her, not from your [listed alibi]\n      witness. You see? It probably could have been different\n\n                                        -20-\n\f           On appeal, Llinas contends that both the payroll records\n\nand the accountant's testimony should have been excluded because,\n\nhad she been aware of the government's intention to introduce\n\nevidence indicating that she had not been at work on June 16th, she\n\n\"very well could have determined that she was incorrect in thinking\n\nthat she had worked [on] that particular day and [might have\n\ndecided] not [to] present[] any alibi evidence at all.\"\n\n           At the outset, we note that, by its own terms, Rule 12.1\n\nrequires the disclosure of witnesses –- not documents.            See id.;\n\nsee also United States v. Carrasquillo-Plaza, 873 F.2d 10, 12 (1st\n\nCir. 1989) (\"[T]he reciprocal duty imposed on the government is\n\nlimited to the disclosure of the names and addresses of witnesses\n\nupon whom the government intends to rely . . . .\" (emphases\n\nretained));   United States v. Jones, 255 F.3d 916, 918 (8th Cir.\n\n2001)   (\"[Rule   12.1(b)]   requires    disclosure   of   the   names   and\n\naddresses of the government's rebuttal witnesses, not all its\n\nrebuttal evidence[;] [t]hus, Rule 12.1(b) does not apply to the\n\ndocument used to impeach [the witness].\").       Accordingly, we reject\n\n\n\n     had you presented your alibi witness and then he – the\n     Government might be prevented from bringing another\n     witness because he didn't give that name to you. But in\n     this case, it is the defendant herself who said, 'Yes, I\n     worked on the 16th.' You presented a stub to try to show\n     that she worked on that day, and I recall that I said,\n     'Well, this doesn't show the days she worked. Merely in\n     that pay period she earned whatever amount is there.'\n     But it doesn't show days of work nor specific hours\n     worked on specific days. So the Government is entitled\n     to rebut that evidence.\n\n                                  -21-\n\fLlinas's argument that the district court erred in allowing the\n\ngovernment to introduce the supermarket's payroll records.\n\n             The thornier issue is whether the accountant's testimony\n\nfalls within the purview of Rule 12.1(b).                Given the content of\n\nLlinas's 12.1(a) notice, the government had no reason to know that\n\nit   might   need    to    rely   upon    the   accountant's        authenticating\n\ntestimony.     After all, the witness that Llinas had noticed in her\n\nRule 12.1(a) disclosure, the store manager, easily could have laid\n\nthe foundation for –- and elaborated upon the implications of –-\n\nthe payroll records on cross examination by the government.                      In\n\nother words, it was not until unforeseen events had unfolded at\n\ntrial –- in particular, Llinas's testimony and the introduction\n\ninto evidence of the paycheck stub through her testimony –- that\n\nthe government had reason to know that the accountant would be\n\nneeded as a rebuttal witness.             Whether or not this witness fell\n\nwithin the purview of Rule 12.1, under these circumstances the\n\ndistrict court       did    not   abuse   its   discretion     in    allowing   the\n\naccountant to authenticate the payroll records.\n\n                                         III.\n\n             For    the    reasons   stated     above,   the   convictions      are\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n                          Concurring opinion follows.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -22-\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge, with whom LIPEZ, Circuit Judge,\n\njoins (concurring).   This is an unusual case and a troubling one.\n\nBut for Llinas' false testimony, this would be an instance in which\n\nthe defendant's conduct was as consistent with innocence as with\n\nguilt.   Assuredly, Llinas' actions were enough to constitute\n\nparticipation:   she drove the car, got directions, handed over the\n\ndrugs.   But if she did not know that this was part of a drug\n\ntransaction, she was not guilty of a crime.           The evidence of\n\nknowledge is very thin.\n\n            Had the defense rested without putting on a case, any\n\nconviction that followed would have been reversed by the panel.\n\nCf., e.g., United States v. Corchado-Peralta, 318 F.3d 255, 259-60\n\n(1st Cir.    2003).   The   line   between   reasonable   inference   and\n\nspeculation is very hard to draw; but up to the point when Llinas\n\ntook the stand, there was little to distinguish her from her\n\nboyfriend, whom the jury properly acquitted.        She had apparently\n\nbeen seen on a prior occasion waiting for Martínez, but this was\n\nconsistent with the fact that he was also a guest of her father and\n\nadded little to the government's evidence of knowledge.\n\n            Admittedly, the government's direct case against Llinas\n\nwent slightly beyond \"mere presence.\"        Llinas was present during\n\nthe coded-language telephone conversation between Martínez and the\n\nundercover agent that is described in the panel opinion, and her\n\nsubservience to Martínez at the racetrack was mildly suspicious.\n\n\n                                   -23-\n\fYet Llinas could well not have known that she was driving Martínez\n\nto a drug transaction, and the sum is remarkably slim evidence for\n\nsending this young woman to federal prison for more than ten years.\n\n(The principal culprits got four and seven years, respectively).\n\n          Nevertheless, when Llinas took the stand and then lied\n\n(or so the jury could have found), she gave the jury the extra\n\nevidence it needed and the conviction was not irrational.        Of\n\ncourse, her denial of presence at a secondary event could have been\n\nthe product of pure fear or misrecollection, but the jury is\n\npermitted to draw an inference of guilt from a deliberate false\n\nalibi.   See, e.g., United States v. Hadfield, 918 F.2d 987, 999\n\n(1st Cir. 1990), cert. denied, 500 U.S. 936 (1991).    Added to the\n\nfaintly suspicious circumstances, a jury could rationally convict,\n\nalthough this stretches \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" to its limits.\n\nFederal drug cases in which strong doubts as to guilt linger on\n\nappeal are a rarity.\n\n          Llinas unquestionably has a potential claim under section\n\n2255 that she has been deprived of competent representation.     28\n\nU.S.C. § 2255 (2000).   This is not because of counsel's decision to\n\ngo forward with an affirmative defense case once the Rule 29 motion\n\nhad been denied; given the denial, it was a reasonable choice to\n\noffer a defense even at the cost of waiving the right to appeal the\n\ndenial as measured by the government's case alone.      Rather, the\n\npotential claim of incompetence relates to the decision to allow\n\n\n\n                                -24-\n\fLlinas to testify and provide an alibi that could, as it turned\n\nout, be so easily undermined by available company records.\n\n             The error was surely prejudicial under the governing\n\nStrickland test.          See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\n\n687-88 & 694 (1984).         Indeed, without the false alibi, Llinas'\n\nconviction    could    not   properly     be    sustained.        But   background\n\ncircumstances could provide some explanation for counsel's action:\n\nperhaps Llinas insisted on testifying despite counsel's warning or\n\nperhaps the fact that the alibi could so easily be undermined would\n\nnot   have    been    apparent     to    a     lawyer    making    a    reasonable\n\ninvestigation.

Soon thereafter, Sanchez told Mart&#237;nez about a recent encounter he had had with a man called \"Guillermo,\" who had proposed that Sanchez visit Puerto Rico to conduct some drug deals. Mart&#237;nez was interested. Neither Sanchez nor Mart&#237;nez was aware that Guillermo was a government informant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 2000, Sanchez and Mart&#237;nez traveled together to Puerto Rico, where Sanchez was to introduce Mart&#237;nez to Guillermo. For his part, Mart&#237;nez tended to the lodging details, initially arranging for the pair to stay at a relative's house. After arriving in Puerto Rico, however, these initial arrangements fell through. In search of a place to stay, Mart&#237;nez then phoned Llinas's stepfather, a family friend, and arranged for the men to stay at his house. Llinas lived with her stepfather.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 16th, Llinas drove Sanchez and Mart&#237;nez to a nearby bakery. While Llinas waited in her car with her stepfather, Sanchez and Mart&#237;nez entered the bakery and met with Guillermo and his partner, Carrasquillo, an undercover agent for the Drug Enforcement Administration. There, the men negotiated a transaction in which Mart&#237;nez agreed to provide, on a later date, two kilograms of heroin in exchange for eleven kilograms of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Approximately one-half hour after entering the bakery, Sanchez and Mart&#237;nez exited, and Llinas drove them back to her stepfather's home. Having earned his commission by introducing Mart&#237;nez to Guillermo, Sanchez departed Puerto Rico.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mart&#237;nez did not hear from Carrasquillo until June 30th, when they spoke via cellular telephone. During the course of this coded-language conversation, Mart&#237;nez informed Carrasquillo that \"at hand, I have one and a half ... then by Sunday, I'll have another two ... it would be three and a half.\" The men agreed to exchange the drugs &#8212; or, as Mart&#237;nez put it, \"cook the goose\" &#8212; on July 3rd.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the morning of July 3rd, Mart&#237;nez contacted Carrasquillo to arrange the meeting for that day. A few hours later, in Llinas's presence, Mart&#237;nez again phoned Carrasquillo and informed him that he \"went by the office and [] picked the papers up there with the, the, stamps on them and all that....\" The men then agreed to meet at the parking lot of El Comandante racetrack between 4:00 and 4:30 p.m. At this point in the conversation, Mart&#237;nez handed Llinas the cellular phone to receive directions to the racetrack.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Llinas, Mart&#237;nez had asked her to drop him off at the racetrack, where he was to meet a friend who would pick him up. After dropping Mart&#237;nez off, Llinas and her boyfriend, Jos&#233; Arroyo, planned on driving to the beach for the Fourth-of-July holiday.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the way to the racetrack, Llinas and Mart&#237;nez picked up Arroyo in a rental car that Arroyo allegedly had rented for the weekend. They subsequently made a quick stop at a supermarket to purchase provisions for the beach. While Llinas and Arroyo were inside, Mart&#237;nez waited in the parking lot and made two additional calls to Carrasquillo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having completed this errand, the trio set off for the rendezvous at the racetrack. Mart&#237;nez was driving; Arroyo was in the passenger seat and Llinas was in the back. Next to Llinas in the backseat were two cellular telephone boxes stacked inside a large plastic bag. The boxes contained plastic bags filled with 1787 grams of heroin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At approximately 4:30 p.m., they arrived at the racetrack's parking lot. Mart&#237;nez parked the car, exited, and approached Carrasquillo. Llinas and Arroyo remained inside. According to Llinas's testimony, Mart&#237;nez had asked them to wait \"because he was going to decide where he was going with his friend.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon agreeing with Carrasquillo to proceed with the exchange, Mart&#237;nez walked over to the car, opened the rear door, and asked Llinas to hand him the bag next to her. According to Llinas, after she handed Mart&#237;nez the bag that she believed contained cellular telephones, she \"asked him whether we could leave yet and he said no because the friend that was going to pick him up hadn't arrived yet.\" Carrasquillo and Mart&#237;nez then moved to the back of the car to inspect the bag's contents. Once certain that the boxes contained a heroin-like substance, Carrasquillo signaled for the arrest of Mart&#237;nez, Llinas, and Arroyo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 26, 2000, Llinas was arraigned on a three-count indictment. Count I charged Llinas, Arroyo and Mart&#237;nez with conspiracy with the intent to possess and distribute two kilograms of a substance containing a detectable amount of heroin and five kilograms of a substance containing a detectable amount of cocaine, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1); Count II charged Llinas and her co-defendants with aiding and abetting possession with the intent to distribute approximately two kilograms of heroin, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2; and Count III charged Llinas and Mart&#237;nez with aiding and abetting each other in using a communication facility to facilitate the conspiracy, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 843(b) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 21, 2000, a joint trial began; Llinas and Arroyo were co-defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On November 28, 2000, a jury found Llinas guilty on Counts I and III and not guilty on Count II. Arroyo was acquitted on all counts. On April 24, 2001, the district court sentenced Llinas to concurrent prison terms of 123 months for Count I and 24 months for Count III, three years of supervised release, and $200 in special assessments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are presented with two issues on appeal: (1) whether there was sufficient evidence to support Llinas's convictions; and (2) whether the district court erred when it allowed the government to introduce certain documents and testimony, neither of which were noticed to Llinas as allegedly required by Rule 12.1(b) of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these separate issues, two standards of review apply. First, in deciding sufficiency challenges, \"we review all the evidence, direct and circumstantial, in the light most favorable to the prosecution, drawing all reasonable inferences consistent with the verdict, and avoiding credibility judgments, to determine whether a rational jury could have found guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>United States v.

As to the second issue, because the district court's decision to admit the alibi-rebuttal evidence was based on its construction of Rule 12.1(b), we proceed <i>de novo. See United States v. Randazzo,</i> 80 F.3d 623, 627 (1st Cir.1996) (noting that, because the district court's rejection of a motion turned on its construction of a rule of criminal procedure, the court would review the decision <i>de novo</i>); <i>see also United States v. Encarnacion,</i> 239 F.3d 395, 397 (1st Cir.2001) (\"We review <i>de novo</i> the district court's construction of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\" (citation omitted)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Sufficiency of the Evidence</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Llinas's principal argument on appeal is that her convictions should be reversed because there was insufficient evidence at trial to sustain either (1) a finding that she conspired to possess narcotics with the intent to distribute or (2) a finding that she used a communication device to facilitate such a conspiracy. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) Conspiracy Count</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Llinas contends that \"the evidence taken as a whole failed to establish her knowing, intentional participation in the drug conspiracy... beyond a reasonable doubt....\" More specifically, she argues that, \"[a]side from the total lack of evidence presented by the government concerning her knowledge and criminal intent[,] there is a substantial amount of evidence that established that [she] did not know about [the conspiracy].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To prove the elements of the crime of conspiracy, the government must show the existence of a conspiracy, the defendant's knowledge of the conspiracy, and the defendant's voluntary participation in the conspiracy. More specifically, to establish that a defendant belonged to and participated in a conspiracy, the government must prove two kinds of intent: intent to agree [with her co-conspirators] and intent to commit the substantive offense. Such proof may consist of circumstantial evidence, including inferences from surrounding circumstances, such as acts committed by the defendant that furthered the conspiracy's purposes. The government need not prove that a co-conspirator knew all of the details or participated in all of the objectives of the plan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

Nelson-Rodriguez,</i> 319 F.3d 12, 27 (1st Cir.2003) (listing the \"three basic components of a drug conspiracy\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because Llinas does not contest the existence of a criminal conspiracy between Sanchez and Mart&#237;nez,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> we consider only whether the government proved beyond a reasonable doubt both that Llinas knew of the conspiracy and that she voluntarily participated in it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is clear from the record that Llinas engaged in activity that would be illegal had she known about the Sanchez-Mart&#237;nez conspiracy. For example, Llinas testified that, on the day of the exchange, she picked up the boxed heroin from the backseat of the car and handed it to Mart&#237;nez. This evidence alone arguably is sufficient to prove voluntary participation in the conspiracy, including an intent to commit the underlying substantive offense, <i>if</i> Llinas knew that drugs were in the box.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Llinas's conviction, then, turns on the question of when, if ever, she gained knowledge of the conspiracy. At trial, no direct evidence was presented on this issue; instead, as is permissible, the jury inferred knowledge from the government's circumstantial evidence. <i>See Gomez-Pabon,</i> 911 F.2d at 853 (\"[P]roof may consist of circumstantial evidence, including inferences from surrounding circumstances, such as acts committed by the defendant that furthered the conspiracy's purposes.\" (citations omitted)); <i>see also United States v. Valerio,</i> 48 F.3d 58, 63 (1st Cir.1995) (noting that \"the government's proof may lay <i>entirely</i> in circumstantial evidence\" (citation omitted and emphasis retained)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the evidence is not overwhelming, we conclude that the jury, having been properly instructed,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> could have found that the evidence was sufficient to prove the requisite knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt. The inference that Llinas was, in fact, a knowing participant in the conspiracy is adequately supported by substantial circumstantial evidence <i>together with</i> evidence that Llinas testified untruthfully at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, there was substantial circumstantial evidence suggesting that Llinas knew about the conspiracy. This evidence can be summarized as follows: While in Puerto Rico, Sanchez and Mart&#237;nez stayed with Llinas in the same house; despite her testimony to the contrary,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Llinas drove Sanchez and Mart&#237;nez to their initial meeting with Carrasquillo, waited in the car approximately one-half hour, and then drove them back to her stepfather's home; Llinas was present when Mart&#237;nez phoned Carrasquillo and spoke about the drug exchange (albeit in coded language); on the day of the drug exchange, Mart&#237;nez handed Llinas the telephone so that she could receive directions to the racetrack; Llinas agreed to provide the transportation to the racetrack in her boyfriend's rental car; after Llinas arrived at the racetrack, an undercover agent allegedly observed her \"moving [her] head[] like looking for something\";<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> when asked, Llinas handed Mart&#237;nez the drugs, which had been hidden in boxes next to her in the backseat; and, following confiscation of the heroin that was placed in two Ericsson cellular telephone boxes, agents seized two Ericsson cellular telephones from the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Llinas responds to the government's evidence as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is obvious that from the evidence taken as a whole ... that [Mart&#237;nez] used [Llinas] to provide him with transportation without [Llinas] having knowledge that he was engaged in narcotics trafficking with Daniel Sanchez. Whatever actions [Llinas] took in providing a ride to [Mart&#237;nez] and Sanchez on June 16 and July 3, [they] were carried out without criminal knowledge and intent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are unconvinced. While \"mere presence at the scene of the crime\" or \"mere association with conspirators\" is not enough to establish guilt, <i>see Gomez-Pabon,</i> 911 F.2d at 853, \"the mere presence defense is not so ubiquitous as to envelop every drug-trafficking case in which the government lacks direct evidence of a defendant's complicity.\" <i>Echeverri,</i> 982 F.2d at 678. <i>See also United States v. Flores-Rivera,</i> 56 F.3d 319, 324 (1st Cir.1995) (\"Mere presence at the scene and close association with those involved are insufficient factors alone; nevertheless, they are <i>relevant</i> factors for the jury.\" (quoting <i>United States v. Sanchez,</i> 961 F.2d 1169, 1174 (5th Cir.1992)) (emphasis retained)). \"As we repeatedly have recognized, a jury is free to rely on its common sense and may infer that criminal conspirators do not involve innocent persons at critical stages of a drug deal.\" <i>United States v. DiMarzo,</i> 80 F.3d 656, 661 (1st Cir.1996) (citations omitted). \"[S]uch is not normally the conduct that one would expect of conspirators engaged in conduct which by its nature is kept secret from outsiders.\" <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 680 F.2d 255, 260 (1st Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, of course, Llinas was more than merely present. On at least one occasion, Llinas provided the necessary transportation. And, as the evidence shows, her usefulness extended much further than the car. First, Llinas alone had the directions to the racetrack; but for her guidance, it is likely that Mart&#237;nez never would have arrived. Second, when asked, Llinas picked up the heroin that was next to her on the backseat and handed it to Mart&#237;nez; that the drugs were concealed within boxes is, of course, not enough to require a finding of reasonable doubt as to knowledge, since the jury was entitled to infer knowledge from the other circumstantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to evidence of Llinas's affirmative involvement in the conspiracy, the government also presented evidence showing what Llinas <i>did not</i> do. For example, notwithstanding her testimony that she planned to drop Mart&#237;nez off at the racetrack and then leave for the beach, neither Llinas nor her boyfriend ever moved from their respective positions in the car to take Mart&#237;nez's place in the driver's seat; instead, they remained at the racetrack and waited for Mart&#237;nez. Having observed these nonevents on the videotape of the arrest and having heard unrebutted testimony that the heroin was to be exchanged for eleven kilograms of cocaine, the jury was free to infer that the more likely story was that Llinas and Mart&#237;nez planned to leave the racetrack together, along with the cocaine for which they arrived in the first place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On facts analogous to these, where the defendant-driver alleged not only that \"he had merely given [a conspirator] a ride and [had] not participate[d] in the drug sale\" but also that \"there was no evidence that he could see what was in the box,\" we noted that \"the jury could reasonably have inferred that under these potentially dangerous circumstances, an insider rather than an outsider would chauffeur the dealer.\" <i>United States v. Olivo-Infante,</i> 938 F.2d 1406, 1409 (1st Cir.1991). So too in this case. <i>See Echeverri,</i> 982 F.2d at 678 (\"[W]e require only that a jury's verdict be supportable, not that it be inevitable....\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Llinas, however, argues that \"the present case is akin to several appeals where this court has not hesitated to reverse convictions on sufficiency grounds where the government failed to establish that the actions taken by the defendant were made with criminal knowledge and intent\" (citing <i>United States v. Francomano,</i> 554 F.2d 483 (1st Cir.1977); <i>United States v. Mehtala,</i> 578 F.2d 6 (1st Cir.1978); <i>United States v. Ocampo,</i> 964 F.2d 80 (1st Cir.1992); <i>Valerio,</i> 48 F.3d 58; <i>United States v. de la Cruz-Paulino,</i> 61 F.3d 986 (1st Cir.1995); <i>United States v. Clotida,</i> 892 F.2d 1098 (1st Cir.1989)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These cases are inapposite because, unlike in this case, the factfinder did not have evidence suggesting that the defendant had lied on the witness stand. In <i>Francomano,</i> for example, we based our decision to vacate the conviction on findings that \"the Government made no case-in-chief <i>and</i> no testimony offered by the [defendants] strengthen[ed] the Government's case.\" 554 F.2d at 487 (emphasis added). We noted that, while a jury may sometimes infer guilt from the mere fact that the defendant lied on the stand, \"we [could] detect no inconsistencies or other appropriate basis for such an inference here.\" <i>Id.</i> at 487-88.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, even if we were to assume that the government's circumstantial evidence, taken alone, was insufficient to support an inference of knowledge, we cannot ignore the strong possibility that the jury determined that Llinas had lied on the witness stand. At trial, Llinas testified that she could not have driven Sanchez and Mart&#237;nez to their meeting with Carrasquillo because she had been working on the day in question. Not only did the government present evidence in rebuttal suggesting that Llinas had not worked that day, it had also presented Sanchez's testimony that Llinas had driven them to their meeting and Carrasquillo's corroborating testimony that a woman fitting Llinas's description had driven the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having reason to doubt Llinas's credibility, the jury properly could have disregarded all of Llinas's testimony, including the beach-weekend explanation for her presence at the racetrack. See <i>United States v.

Specifically, she intended to introduce a paycheck stub (which was attached to the notice) and testimony from a manager at the supermarket where she worked. Llinas herself was not listed as a witness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having fulfilled her obligation under Rule 12.1(a), the government had a reciprocal obligation under Rule 12.1(b) to respond with a list of \"<i>witnesses</i> to be relied on to rebut testimony of any of the defendant's alibi witnesses.\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). The government did not file such a response. Whether one was required is, of course, the dispositive question.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At trial, Llinas herself testified that she had not driven Mart&#237;nez and Sanchez to the bakery on the 16th &#8212; a story that defense counsel attempted to corroborate by offering into evidence a paycheck stub that allegedly placed Llinas at work on the day in question. During a sidebar conference following these events, the government informed defense counsel that it had obtained payroll records from the supermarket that cast serious doubt on the validity of Llinas's testimony. Despite objection, the government was allowed to introduce these records as impeachment evidence through the testimony of the supermarket's accountant, who was called to authenticate the documents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Llinas contends that both the payroll records and the accountant's testimony should have been excluded because, had she been aware of the government's intention to introduce evidence indicating that she had not been at work on June 16th, she \"very well could have determined that she was incorrect in thinking that she had worked [on] that particular day and [might have decided] not [to] present[] any alibi evidence at all.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we note that, by its own terms, Rule 12.1 requires the disclosure of witnesses &#8212; not documents. <i>See id.; see also United States v. Carrasquillo-Plaza,</i> 873 F.2d 10, 12 (1st Cir.1989) (\"[T]he reciprocal duty imposed on the government is limited to the disclosure of the names and addresses of <i>witnesses</i> upon whom the <i>government</i> intends to rely....\" (emphases retained)); <i>United States v. Jones,</i> 255 F.3d 916, 918 (8th Cir.2001) (\"[Rule 12.1(b)] requires disclosure of the names and addresses of the government's rebuttal witnesses, not all its rebuttal evidence[;][t]hus, Rule 12.1(b) does not apply to the document used to impeach [the witness].\"). Accordingly, we reject Llinas's argument that the district court erred in allowing the government to introduce the supermarket's payroll records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The thornier issue is whether the accountant's testimony falls within the purview of Rule 12.1(b). Given the content of Llinas's 12.1(a) notice, the government had no reason to know that it might need to rely upon the accountant's authenticating testimony. After all, the witness that Llinas had noticed in her Rule 12.1(a) disclosure, the store manager, easily could have laid the foundation for &#8212; and elaborated upon the implications of &#8212; the payroll records on cross examination by the government. In other words, it was not until unforeseen events had unfolded at trial &#8212; in particular, Llinas's testimony and the introduction into evidence of the paycheck stub through <i>her</i> testimony &#8212; that the government had reason to know that the accountant would be needed as a rebuttal witness. Whether or not this witness fell within the purview of Rule 12.1, under these circumstances the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the accountant to authenticate the payroll records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the convictions are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Pointing to background voices that can be heard on Agent Carrasquillo's tape-recording of the June 30th conversation, the government repeatedly asserts in its brief that Llinas was present during this dialogue.

Llinas thereafter presented evidence in her defense, thus waiving review of her initial motion<i>See United States v. Ruiz,</i> 105 F.3d 1492, 1495 n. 1 (1st Cir.1997) (citing <i>United States v. Amparo,</i> 961 F.2d 288, 291 (1st Cir.1992)). Therefore, we review the evidence presented by Llinas during her case-in-chief in the light most favorable to the verdicts. <i>See Ruiz,</i> 105 F.3d at 1495 n. 1.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> According to Llinas's brief, \"[f]rom the testimony of undercover agent Carrasquillo[,] the government established that ...

They are always looking around at everything, and I never write those details in a [report].</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Q: Well, sir, is that an assumption you are making because you thought that the people inside the car knew what was going on? ...</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">A: Well, based on my experience, I know.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Q: Exactly.

The important issue in the case involved Llinas's knowledge (or lack thereof) &#8212; not whether she was driving the car on June 16th (especially given the permissible inference that she simply was providing a ride to a house guest). But, Llinas has made no ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal and, in any event, the record is not sufficiently clear to allow us to consider it in the first instance (in part because the record is silent as to counsel's rationale). Any further elaboration of the issue must thus await a motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Rule 12.1 was amended in 2002; the changes were primarily stylistic<i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 12.1, advisory committee's note (2002).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The specific basis for the district court's ruling is embedded in the following exchange:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Court:</i> Why didn't you provide the name of this witness to counsel?</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Government:</i> At the time defendant took the stand and decided to tell that she did work on the 16th of June, at that point the matter was triggered, so at this point in time, in open court and for the record, I told Brother Counsel and I showed him the-a photocopy of the books of [the supermarket]. And I immediately told my case agent, `Go get this man, because I am going to impeach this witness.'</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Court:</i> Well, [defense] counsel, the statement came out in open court from her, not from your [listed alibi] witness. You see? It probably could have been different had you presented your alibi witness and then he &#8212; the Government might be prevented from bringing another witness because he didn't give that name to you. But in this case, it is the defendant herself who said, `Yes, I worked on the 16th.' You presented a stub to try to show that she worked on that day, and I recall that I said, `Well, this doesn't show the days she worked. Merely in that pay period she earned whatever amount is there.' But it doesn't show days of work nor specific hours worked on specific days. So the Government is entitled to rebut that evidence.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOUDIN, Chief Judge, with whom LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, joins (concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an unusual case and a troubling one. But for Llinas' false testimony, this would be an instance in which the defendant's conduct was as consistent with innocence as with guilt. Assuredly, Llinas' actions were enough to constitute participation: she drove the car, got directions, handed over the drugs. But if she did not know that this was part of a drug transaction, she was not guilty of a crime. The evidence of knowledge is very thin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the defense rested without putting on a case, any conviction that followed would have been reversed by the panel. <i>Cf., e.g., United States v. Corchado-Peralta,</i> 318 F.3d 255, 259-60 (1st Cir.2003). The line between reasonable inference and speculation is very hard to draw; but up to the point when Llinas took the stand, there was little to distinguish her from her boyfriend, whom the jury properly acquitted. She had apparently been seen on a prior occasion waiting for Mart&#237;nez, but this was consistent with the fact that he was also a guest of her father and added little to the government's evidence of knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the government's direct case against Llinas went slightly beyond \"mere presence.\" Llinas was present during the coded-language telephone conversation between Mart&#237;nez and the undercover agent that is described in the panel opinion, and her subservience to Mart&#237;nez at the racetrack was mildly suspicious. Yet Llinas could well not have known that she was driving Mart&#237;nez to a drug transaction, and the sum is remarkably slim evidence for sending this young woman to federal prison for more than ten years. (The principal culprits got four and seven years, respectively).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, when Llinas took the stand and then lied (or so the jury could have found), she gave the jury the extra evidence it needed and the conviction was not irrational. Of course, her denial of presence at a secondary event could have been the product of pure fear or misrecollection, but the jury is permitted to draw an inference of guilt from a deliberate false alibi. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Hadfield,</i> 918 F.2d 987, 999 (1st Cir.1990), <i>cert. denied,</i> 500 U.S. 936, 111 S.Ct. 2062, 114 L.Ed.2d 466 (1991). Added to the faintly suspicious circumstances, a jury could rationally convict, although this stretches \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" to its limits. Federal drug cases in which strong doubts as to guilt linger on appeal are a rarity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Llinas unquestionably has a potential claim under section 2255 that she has been deprived of competent representation. 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255 (2000). This is not because of counsel's decision to go forward with an affirmative defense case once the Rule 29 motion had been denied; given the denial, it was a reasonable choice to offer a defense even at the cost of waiving the right to appeal the denial as measured by the government's case alone. Rather, the potential claim of incompetence relates to the decision to allow Llinas to testify and provide an alibi that could, as it turned out, be so easily undermined by available company records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The error was surely prejudicial under the governing <i>Strickland</i> test. <i>See Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 687-88 &amp; 694, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984). Indeed, without the false alibi, Llinas' conviction could not properly be sustained. But background circumstances could provide some explanation for counsel's action: perhaps Llinas insisted on testifying despite counsel's warning or perhaps the fact that the alibi could so easily be undermined would not have been apparent to a lawyer making a reasonable investigation. It is because of such uncertainties that here, as in the ordinary case, the competence issue cannot be resolved on direct appeal. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Padilla-Galarza,</i> 351 F.3d 594, 600-01 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If and when Llinas does file a section 2255 motion, it should be given expeditious treatment, and able counsel should be appointed to represent Llinas. 18 U.S.C. 3006A(a)(2)(B) (2000). Why this case was brought against Llinas remains a mystery. The government had no reason to expect the windfall of Llinas' apparently false testimony and, on the evidence presented for its direct case, no prosecutor should have foreseen a reasonable likelihood of a legitimate conviction. As for the decision to prosecute the boyfriend, the mind reels in disbelief.</p>\n    </div>\n    ",

For example, Llinas testified that, on the day of the exchange, she picked up the boxed heroin from the backseat of the car and handed it to Mart&#237;nez.

On at least one occasion, Llinas provided the necessary transportation. And, as the evidence shows, her usefulness extended much further than the car. First, Llinas alone had the directions to the racetrack; but for her guidance, it is likely that Mart&#237;nez never would have arrived. Second, when asked, Llinas picked up the heroin that was next to her on the backseat and handed it to Mart&#237;nez; that the drugs were concealed within boxes is, of course, not enough to require a finding of reasonable doubt as to knowledge, since the jury was entitled to infer knowledge from the other circumstantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to evidence of Llinas's affirmative involvement in the conspiracy, the government also presented evidence showing what Llinas <i>did not</i> do.

Having observed these nonevents on the videotape of the arrest and having heard unrebutted testimony that the heroin was to be exchanged for eleven kilograms of cocaine, the jury was free to infer that the more likely story was that Llinas and Mart&#237;nez planned to leave the racetrack together, along with the cocaine for which they arrived in the first place.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On facts analogous to these, where the defendant-driver alleged not only that \"he had merely given [a conspirator] a ride and [had] not participate[d] in the drug sale\" but also that \"there was no evidence that he could see what was in the box,\" we noted that \"the jury could reasonably have inferred that under these potentially dangerous circumstances, an insider rather than an outsider would chauffeur the dealer.\" <i>United States v.

During a sidebar conference following these events, the government informed defense counsel that it had obtained payroll records from the supermarket that cast serious doubt on the validity of Llinas's testimony. Despite objection, the government was allowed to introduce these records as impeachment evidence through the testimony of the supermarket's accountant, who was called to authenticate the documents.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Llinas contends that both the payroll records and the accountant's testimony should have been excluded because, had she been aware of the government's intention to introduce evidence indicating that she had not been at work on June 16th, she \"very well could have determined that she was incorrect in thinking that she had worked [on] that particular day and [might have decided] not [to] present[] any alibi evidence at all.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, we note that, by its own terms, Rule 12.1 requires the disclosure of witnesses &#8212; not documents. <i>See id.; see also United States v.

After all, the witness that Llinas had noticed in her Rule 12.1(a) disclosure, the store manager, easily could have laid the foundation for &#8212; and elaborated upon the implications of &#8212; the payroll records on cross examination by the government. In other words, it was not until unforeseen events had unfolded at trial &#8212; in particular, Llinas's testimony and the introduction into evidence of the paycheck stub through <i>her</i> testimony &#8212; that the government had reason to know that the accountant would be needed as a rebuttal witness. Whether or not this witness fell within the purview of Rule 12.1, under these circumstances the district court did not abuse its discretion in allowing the accountant to authenticate the payroll records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the convictions are <i>affirmed.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Pointing to background voices that can be heard on Agent Carrasquillo's tape-recording of the June 30th conversation, the government repeatedly asserts in its brief that Llinas was present during this dialogue.

The important issue in the case involved Llinas's knowledge (or lack thereof) &#8212; not whether she was driving the car on June 16th (especially given the permissible inference that she simply was providing a ride to a house guest). But, Llinas has made no ineffective assistance of counsel claim on direct appeal and, in any event, the record is not sufficiently clear to allow us to consider it in the first instance (in part because the record is silent as to counsel's rationale). Any further elaboration of the issue must thus await a motion for relief under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Rule 12.1 was amended in 2002; the changes were primarily stylistic<i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 12.1, advisory committee's note (2002).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> The specific basis for the district court's ruling is embedded in the following exchange:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Court:</i> Why didn't you provide the name of this witness to counsel?</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Government:</i> At the time defendant took the stand and decided to tell that she did work on the 16th of June, at that point the matter was triggered, so at this point in time, in open court and for the record, I told Brother Counsel and I showed him the-a photocopy of the books of [the supermarket]. And I immediately told my case agent, `Go get this man, because I am going to impeach this witness.'</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>The Court:</i> Well, [defense] counsel, the statement came out in open court from her, not from your [listed alibi] witness. You see? It probably could have been different had you presented your alibi witness and then he &#8212; the Government might be prevented from bringing another witness because he didn't give that name to you. But in this case, it is the defendant herself who said, `Yes, I worked on the 16th.' You presented a stub to try to show that she worked on that day, and I recall that I said, `Well, this doesn't show the days she worked. Merely in that pay period she earned whatever amount is there.' But it doesn't show days of work nor specific hours worked on specific days. So the Government is entitled to rebut that evidence.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">BOUDIN, Chief Judge, with whom LIPEZ, Circuit Judge, joins (concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is an unusual case and a troubling one. But for Llinas' false testimony, this would be an instance in which the defendant's conduct was as consistent with innocence as with guilt. Assuredly, Llinas' actions were enough to constitute participation: she drove the car, got directions, handed over the drugs. But if she did not know that this was part of a drug transaction, she was not guilty of a crime. The evidence of knowledge is very thin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Had the defense rested without putting on a case, any conviction that followed would have been reversed by the panel. <i>Cf., e.g., United States v.

The line between reasonable inference and speculation is very hard to draw; but up to the point when Llinas took the stand, there was little to distinguish her from her boyfriend, whom the jury properly acquitted. She had apparently been seen on a prior occasion waiting for Mart&#237;nez, but this was consistent with the fact that he was also a guest of her father and added little to the government's evidence of knowledge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Admittedly, the government's direct case against Llinas went slightly beyond \"mere presence.\" Llinas was present during the coded-language telephone conversation between Mart&#237;nez and the undercover agent that is described in the panel opinion, and her subservience to Mart&#237;nez at the racetrack was mildly suspicious. Yet Llinas could well not have known that she was driving Mart&#237;nez to a drug transaction, and the sum is remarkably slim evidence for sending this young woman to federal prison for more than ten years. (The principal culprits got four and seven years, respectively).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, when Llinas took the stand and then lied (or so the jury could have found), she gave the jury the extra evidence it needed and the conviction was not irrational. Of course, her denial of presence at a secondary event could have been the product of pure fear or misrecollection, but the jury is permitted to draw an inference of guilt from a deliberate false alibi. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Hadfield,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"551471\"><a href=\"/opinion/551471/united-states-v-royal-w-hadfield-jr-united-states-of-america-v-helen/\"><span class=\"volume\">918</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">987</span></a></span>, 999 (1st Cir.1990), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">500</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">936</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Added to the faintly suspicious circumstances, a jury could rationally convict, although this stretches \"beyond a reasonable doubt\" to its limits.

This is not because of counsel's decision to go forward with an affirmative defense case once the Rule 29 motion had been denied; given the denial, it was a reasonable choice to offer a defense even at the cost of waiving the right to appeal the denial as measured by the government's case alone. Rather, the potential claim of incompetence relates to the decision to allow Llinas to testify and provide an alibi that could, as it turned out, be so easily undermined by available company records.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The error was surely prejudicial under the governing <i>Strickland</i> test. <i>See Strickland v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">674</span></a></span> (1984). Indeed, without the false alibi, Llinas' conviction could not properly be sustained. But background circumstances could provide some explanation for counsel's action: perhaps Llinas insisted on testifying despite counsel's warning or perhaps the fact that the alibi could so easily be undermined would not have been apparent to a lawyer making a reasonable investigation. It is because of such uncertainties that here, as in the ordinary case, the competence issue cannot be resolved on direct appeal. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

Why this case was brought against Llinas remains a mystery. The government had no reason to expect the windfall of Llinas' apparently false testimony and, on the evidence presented for its direct case, no prosecutor should have foreseen a reasonable likelihood of a legitimate conviction.
