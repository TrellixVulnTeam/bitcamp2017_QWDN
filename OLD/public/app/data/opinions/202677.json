D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                   Selya, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Michael B. Whipple and Thomas F. Hallett Law Offices on brief\nfor appellant.\n     Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and F. Mark Terison,\nSenior Litigation Counsel, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             March 27, 2007\n\f           Per Curiam.   In United States v. Washington, 434 F.3d 7\n\n(1st Cir. 2006), we affirmed the conviction of defendant-appellant\n\nGeorge Washington a/k/a Anthony Long on various drug-trafficking\n\ncharges.   See id. at 17.    We vacated his sentence, however, and\n\nremanded the case for resentencing in light of United States v.\n\nBooker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005).   See Washington, 434 F.3d at 17.   On\n\nremand, the district court, operating under an advisory guidelines\n\nregime, again sentenced the defendant to a 360-month incarcerative\n\nterm.   This timely appeal ensued.\n\n           The relevant facts are set out in our earlier opinion,\n\nsee id. at 9-11, and it is unnecessary to rehearse them here.    At\n\npresent, the defendant asserts four principal claims of error.\n\nNone of them requires extended comment.\n\n           The defendant's first claim of error relates to the\n\ndistrict court's application of the career offender guideline. See\n\nUSSG §4B1.1.   The gist of his claim is that the prior convictions\n\nupon which his career offender designation was based should have\n\nbeen charged in the indictment and their existence proven to the\n\njury beyond a reasonable doubt.        Instead, the district court,\n\napplying a preponderance of the evidence standard, determined the\n\nexistence of those convictions at the disposition hearing.       The\n\ndefendant asserts that this procedure abridged his Sixth Amendment\n\nrights.\n\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\f          This claim of error is foreclosed by Supreme Court\n\nprecedent.    See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U.S. 224,\n\n226-27 (1998). We repeatedly have rejected the argument that we\n\nshould treat this precedent as impliedly overruled.     See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Miller, ___ F.3d ___, ___ (1st Cir. 2007) [No. 05-\n\n2763, slip op. at 4]; United States v. Bennett, 469 F.3d 46, 51\n\n(1st Cir. 2006); United States v. Coplin, 463 F.3d 96, 104-05 (1st\n\nCir. 2006); United States v. Richards, 456 F.3d 260, 262 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); United States v. Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 520 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (en banc), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 928 (2007).   Because we\n\nare bound to follow these decisions and to honor the holding of\n\nAlmendarez-Torres unless and until the Supreme Court overrules that\n\nholding, we reject the defendant's first claim of error.\n\n          Next, the defendant contends that the district court\n\nerred in giving \"presumptive weight\" to the federal sentencing\n\nguidelines.   This contention is not supported by the record.   The\n\ndistrict court made it perfectly clear at the disposition hearing\n\nthat it did not \"place any presumption on the guideline range.\"\n\n          Relatedly, the defendant claims that the district court\n\nat least gave the guidelines substantial weight in the sentencing\n\ncalculus and that, in so doing, the court erred.   It is true that\n\nthe district court gave the guidelines substantial weight but, in\n\nfollowing that course, the court acted altogether appropriately.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\fSee Jiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 518-19.    Consequently, this claim\n\nof error also fails.\n\n          Third, the defendant asseverates that certain of the\n\nprior crimes that served as predicates for the career offender\n\ndesignation were part of a unitary course of conduct and, thus,\n\nshould not have been counted separately.    This asseveration lacks\n\nforce; the issue could have been, but was not, raised in the\n\ndefendant's initial appeal and, therefore, is almost certainly by\n\nthe boards.   See United States v. Bell, 988 F.2d 247, 250 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).\n\n          In all events, the convictions that the defendant cites\n\nwere for offenses that occurred eleven days apart and have no\n\nreadily discernible connection.    Under the sentencing guidelines,\n\n\"[p]rior sentences imposed in unrelated cases are to be counted\n\nseparately.\" USSG §4A1.2(a)(2). Multiple sentences are considered\n\n\"related\" only if those sentences \"resulted from offenses that (1)\n\noccurred on the same occasion, (2) were part of a single common\n\nscheme or plan, or (3) were consolidated for trial or sentencing.\"\n\nId. § 4A1.2, cmt. n.3.   The subject offenses do not fit into any of\n\nthese categories.    Accordingly, the defendant's claim founders.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Correa, 114 F.3d 314, 317 (1st Cir.\n\n1997); United States v. Elwell, 984 F.2d 1289, 1295 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\f             Finally, the defendant makes a somewhat circuitous attack\n\non the reasonableness of his sentence, arguing among other things\n\n(i)   that     a   360-month   period    of   immurement   is   \"grossly\n\ndisproportional\" when compared with certain of his codefendants'\n\nsentences and (ii) that the sentence is too stiff because the trial\n\njudge incorrectly gauged his \"personal characteristics.\"          These\n\narguments are futile.\n\n             The codefendants to whom Washington alludes were, by\n\nreason of cooperation, criminal history, and other differentiating\n\nfactors, not similarly situated.        Therefore, the defendant's 360-\n\nmonth sentence cannot be said to have created an unwarranted\n\nsentencing disparity.     See United States v. Saez, 444 F.3d 15, 18\n\n(1st Cir. 2006) (holding that a sentencing disparity explained by\n\nmaterial differences in various defendants' criminal histories or\n\ndegrees of cooperation is not \"unwarranted\" within the meaning of\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6)).\n\n             As to personal characteristics, the defendant points to\n\nsuch things as his impoverished childhood, the abuse that he\n\nsuffered, and his addiction to drugs.         These and other personal\n\ncharacteristics appear to have been duly considered by the district\n\ncourt.    Given the scope of the correctly calculated guideline\n\nsentencing range,1 the defendant's prolific criminal history, his\n\n\n      1\n      We note that, in this instance, the defendant's guideline\nrange was driven primarily by his prior criminal record and status\nas a career offender. Giving significant weight to a defendant's\n\n                                   -5-\n\flack of remorse, and the district court's express finding that\n\nrecidivism was \"highly predictable\" in this case, we cannot say\n\nthat the within-the-range sentence imposed is unreasonable.            See\n\nJiménez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 519 (stating that, ordinarily, the\n\nreasonableness requirement is satisfied when the court offers a\n\n\"plausible explanation\" for the chosen sentence and reaches a\n\n\"defensible overall result\").\n\n             Saying more would serve no useful purpose. To the extent\n\nthat   the   defendant   has   proffered   other   arguments,   they   are\n\ninsufficiently developed, patently meritless, or both.          Thus, we\n\nneed go no further.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\nextensive criminal history is entirely appropriate.   See United\nStates v. LaBonte, 520 U.S. 751, 753 (1997) (explaining that the\ncareer offender guideline implements a specific congressional\nmandate) (citing 28 U.S.C. § 994(h)); see also United States v.\nPelletier, 469 F.3d 194, 203-04 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                   -6-\n\f",
