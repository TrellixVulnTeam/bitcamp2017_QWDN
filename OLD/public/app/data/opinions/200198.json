Fletcher,   of   the    Ninth   Circuit,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f            SELYA, Circuit Judge. In recent years, the Supreme Court\n\nhas redefined the calculus of federalism, tilting the scales more\n\nand more toward states' rights.        This appeal represents an attempt\n\nby the named defendants — a complement of Massachusetts officials,\n\nincluding the governor, two cabinet officers, and the Commissioner\n\nof the Division of Medical Assistance — to capitalize upon that\n\ntrend.   As we explain below, they seek to push the envelope too\n\nfar.\n\n            We   begin   with   basics.     In   this   class   action,   the\n\nplaintiffs seek prospective injunctive relief to vindicate their\n\nview that the federal Medicaid Act requires Massachusetts to\n\nprovide home-based mental health services to Medicaid-eligible\n\nchildren.   The defendants resist the plaintiffs' interpretation of\n\nthe Medicaid Act.        As a preliminary matter, however, they claim\n\nthat the Eleventh Amendment bars the prosecution of the plaintiffs'\n\naction in a federal court (and, thus, obviates any need to address\n\nthe substantive question).\n\n            The district court rejected the defendants' Eleventh\n\nAmendment    sortie,     and    the   defendants   thereupon    filed     this\n\ninterlocutory appeal.          We affirm the district court's ruling.\n\nWhile recent Supreme Court decisions have made some inroads on the\n\nvenerable doctrine of Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123 (1908), they\n\nhave not eviscerated that doctrine, and only very narrow exceptions\n\ninfringe on the well established right to ask for prospective\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\finjunctive relief against state officials in a federal forum.\n\nConsequently,      the    Eleventh        Amendment      does    not    preclude       the\n\nmaintenance of this action.\n\nI. BACKGROUND\n\n            Congress created the Medicaid program, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396-\n\n1396v, in 1965.     Over time, it augmented the program's coverage to\n\nprovide early and periodic screening, diagnosis and treatment\n\n(EPSDT)    services      to   Medicaid-eligible          children.         See   id.    §§\n\n1396a(a)(10), 1396a(a)(43), 1396d(a)(4)(B), 1396d(r)(5). Congress\n\nintended    that   these      revisions     would     give      children    access      to\n\npreventive      health    care     (e.g.,        vision,    hearing,       and   dental\n\nservices), preempt the onset of childhood illness, and identify\n\nchildren with disabilities in need of early attention.                      See, e.g.,\n\nH.R. Rep. No. 101-247, at §§ 4211-4214 (1989), reprinted in 1989\n\nU.S.C.C.A.N. 1906, 2121-2127; S. Rep. No. 90-744, at § II-G (1967),\n\nreprinted in 1967 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2834, 2869-2871.                   The EPSDT reforms\n\nenacted    by   Congress      in   1989    (as    part     of   the    Omnibus    Budget\n\nReconciliation Act of 1989, Pub. L. No. 101-239, 103 Stat. 2106)\n\nwere particularly noteworthy in two pertinent respects.                           First,\n\nCongress obligated participating states to provide a comprehensive\n\npackage of preventive services that met reasonable standards of\n\nmedical necessity.        42 U.S.C. §§ 1396a(a)(43), 1396d(r).                   Second,\n\nCongress expanded EPSDT services to include \"[s]uch other necessary\n\nhealth care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures\n\n\n                                           -3-\n\fdescribed [as medical assistance] to correct or ameliorate defects\n\nand physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the\n\nscreening services, whether or not such services are covered under\n\nthe State plan.\"        Id. § 1396d(r)(5).         In effect, these amendments\n\nrequired states to provide Medicaid coverage for any service\n\n\"identified as medically necessary through the EPSDT program.\" 135\n\nCong. Rec. S6899, 6900 (daily ed. June 19, 1989) (statement of Sen.\n\nChafee).\n\n             The case before us arises out of a dispute over the\n\nCommonwealth's         obligations       under     sections   1396a(a)(43)    and\n\n1396d(r)(5).      The plaintiffs are nine Medicaid-eligible children,\n\nacting through their parents or guardians, who seek to compel the\n\nCommonwealth      to    furnish    them     with    home-based   mental    health\n\nservices.    Although their particular ailments vary, each plaintiff\n\nhas   been   diagnosed      with     a   severe    psychiatric   or   behavioral\n\ndisorder.     These debilitating conditions have led to a wide array\n\nof unhappy results, including expulsions from schools, cyclical\n\ntransfers between treating facilities, repeated hospitalizations,\n\nand years spent away from family members at crisis stabilization\n\nunits.\n\n             In   the   plaintiffs'       view,    the   Massachusetts    Medicaid\n\nprogram, as presently administered, relies almost exclusively on\n\ninstitution-based psychiatric care.                The plaintiffs allege that\n\nsuch a narrowly focused treatment regime cannot rehabilitate (and,\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\findeed,          may   exacerbate)      their       conditions;      that    home-based\n\npsychiatric care is medically necessary for effective treatment;\n\nthat       the    Commonwealth,      notwithstanding          its    clear    statutory\n\nobligation to provide such services, has taken no action; and that\n\nits lethargy flies in the face of the EPSDT mandates.\n\n                 To right these perceived wrongs, the plaintiffs invoked\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983 and brought suit in federal district court.1                      They\n\nclaim       to    represent    thousands       of    Medicaid-eligible        children,\n\nresident         in    Massachusetts,    who     suffer      from    similarly   severe\n\nbehavioral, emotional, and psychiatric disorders and who require\n\nhome-based care.            The gravamen of their complaint is that the\n\nMedicaid statute entitles the members of the putative class to, and\n\nobligates the Commonwealth to provide, intensive home-based mental\n\nhealth       services.        They   further        allege    that    the    defendants'\n\npersistent denial of such medically necessary treatment has created\n\na \"mental health crisis\" within Massachusetts. On this basis, they\n\n\n\n       1\n           Section 1983 provides in pertinent part:\n\n                 Every person who, under color of any statute,\n                 ordinance, regulation, custom, or usage, of\n                 any State . . . subjects, or causes to be\n                 subjected, any citizen of the United States or\n                 other person within the jurisdiction thereof\n                 to the deprivation of any rights, privileges,\n                 or immunities secured by the Constitution and\n                 laws, shall be liable to the party injured in\n                 an action at law, suit in equity, or other\n                 proper proceeding for redress . . . .\n\n42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\n                                           -5-\n\fask the district court to order the defendants to reform the\n\nMassachusetts Medicaid program to include the home-based mental\n\nhealth care that the EPSDT provisions allegedly require.\n\n             The defendants moved to dismiss the action on three\n\ngrounds.      First, they claim that the Commonwealth's sovereign\n\nimmunity, enshrined in the Eleventh Amendment of the United States\n\nConstitution, bars the suit.2         Second, they assert that the EPSDT\n\nprovisions     of   the   Medicaid   Act    do   not   create   private   rights\n\nenforceable     under     section   1983.     Third,    they    posit   that   the\n\nplaintiffs' complaint fails to state an actionable claim.                      The\n\nplaintiffs opposed this motion and the district court, ruling ore\n\nsponte, denied it.\n\n             The defendants responded by filing this interlocutory\n\nappeal.     The appeal is proper as to the Eleventh Amendment issue,\n\nas pretrial orders granting or denying Eleventh Amendment immunity\n\nare immediately appealable.          See P.R. Aqueduct & Sewer Auth. v.\n\n\n     2\n         The amendment reads:\n\n             The Judicial power of the United States shall\n             not be construed to extend to any suit in law\n             or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one\n             of the United States by Citizens of another\n             State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any\n             Foreign State.\n\nU.S. Const. amend. XI.      Despite its phrasing, the amendment\nconsistently has been read to render a state immune from suits\nbrought in federal courts both by its own citizens and by citizens\nof other states. E.g., Employees of Dep't of Pub. Health & Welfare\nv. Dep't of Pub. Health & Welfare, 411 U.S. 279, 280 (1973); Fred\nv. Roque, 916 F.2d 37, 38 (1st Cir. 1990) (per curiam).\n\n                                      -6-\n\fMetcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 141 (1993).           We affirm the\n\ndistrict court's ruling as it pertains to the issue of Eleventh\n\nAmendment immunity.     The other facets of the order denying the\n\nmotion to dismiss are not ripe for review, and we express no\n\nopinion as to those issues.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n            As a general matter, the Eleventh Amendment bars suits in\n\nfederal courts against unconsenting states (including \"official\n\ncapacity\"   suits   against   state   hierarchs).    De   Leon   Lopez v.\n\nCorporacion Insular de Seguros, 931 F.2d 116, 121 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(collecting   cases).    This   proscription   is   subject   to   a   well\n\nrecognized exception memorialized in Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. at\n\n159-60.    The exception allows federal courts, \"notwithstanding the\n\nabsence of consent, waiver or evidence of congressional assertion\n\nof national hegemony, [to] enjoin state officials to conform future\n\nconduct to the requirements of federal law.\"        Lane v. First Nat'l\n\nBank, 871 F.2d 166, 172 n.5 (1st Cir. 1989) (quoting Ramirez v.\n\nP.R. Fire Serv., 715 F.2d 694, 697 (1st Cir. 1983)).\n\n            For nearly a century, the doctrine of Ex parte Young\n\nflourished and suits against state officials seeking prospective\n\ninjunctive relief were commonplace.        E.g., Quern v. Jordan, 440\n\nU.S. 332, 346-47 (1979); Ramirez, 715 F.2d at 697; Coalition for\n\nBasic Human Needs v. King, 654 F.2d 838, 842 (1st Cir. 1981) (per\n\ncuriam).     Lately, however, the Supreme Court has fashioned an\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fexception to the exception, applicable to certain cases in which\n\n\"Congress has created a remedial scheme for the enforcement of a\n\nparticular federal right.\" Seminole Tribe v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44,\n\n74 (1996).      Since the plaintiffs here sue only for prospective\n\ninjunctive relief, and do so under the imprimatur of Ex parte\n\nYoung, this case requires us to evaluate, for the first time, the\n\nextent to which Seminole Tribe has narrowed the Ex parte Young\n\nexception.\n\n              The litigants sketch the suggested contours of this new\n\nlimitation in very different ways.           The plaintiffs (and the amici)\n\nview Seminole Tribe as a rara avis, asserting that it relates only\n\nto those few federal statutes that contain comprehensive remedial\n\nschemes, and otherwise leaves the doctrine of Ex parte Young alive\n\nand   well.         The   defendants   contend   that   the    Seminole    Tribe\n\nconstraint applies much more broadly.             They tell us that, under\n\nSeminole Tribe, the inquiry into the applicability of Ex parte\n\nYoung in any given case turns upon a comparison between the\n\nremedies conferred by the statute governing the dispute and the\n\njudicial remedies available under Ex parte Young; whenever the\n\nstatute provides anodynes that are more limited than those allowed\n\nunder Ex parte Young, a complainant's redress is restricted to the\n\nformer (and, accordingly, Ex parte Young becomes a dead letter).\n\n              For    purposes   of   analysis,   we   turn    directly    to   the\n\ndefendants' argument.         The defendants base their assessment of the\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fdiminished efficacy of the Ex parte Young exception on their\n\nreading of two recent Supreme Court cases.          They asseverate that,\n\nin Seminole Tribe, the Court examined the remedial provisions\n\ncreated by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), 25 U.S.C. §§\n\n2701-2721, and asked whether those remedies were more circumscribed\n\nthan the relief available under Ex parte Young.             Seminole Tribe,\n\n517   U.S.    at   74-75.    The   defendants   also    contend    that   in   a\n\nsubsequent case, Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 122 S. Ct.\n\n1753, 1761 (2002), the Court undertook a similar inquiry with\n\nrespect to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104,\n\n110 Stat. 56 (codified, as amended, in scattered sections, chiefly\n\nin 47 U.S.C. §§ 151-615).            Building on this foundation, the\n\ndefendants argue that Ex parte Young remains ascendant only when\n\nthe applicable statute authorizes a set of remedies more far-\n\nreaching than prospective injunctive relief.\n\n              Clinging to this approach, the defendants visualize the\n\ncase at hand through the prism of the \"fair hearing\" requirement of\n\nthe Medicaid statute, 42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(3).             That provision,\n\nnestled among a long list of requirements imposed on state plans,3\n\ndeclares tersely that \"[a] State plan for medical assistance must\n\n. . . provide for granting an opportunity for a fair hearing before\n\nthe   State    agency   to   any   individual   whose   claim     for   medical\n\n\n      3\n      One commentator suggests that \"Section 1396a is generally\nregarded to be the longest sentence in the English language.\"\nBarry R. Furrow et al., Health Law § 12-1, at 2 n.2 (2d ed. 2000).\n\n                                      -9-\n\fassistance under the plan is denied or is not acted upon with\n\nreasonable promptness.\" According to the defendants, this language\n\nsupplies a remedy (a fair hearing) more limited than that available\n\nunder Ex parte Young (prospective injunctive relief), and, thus,\n\nprecludes the use of Ex parte Young as an instrument for piercing\n\nthe shield of the Commonwealth's Eleventh Amendment immunity.4\n\n            To be sure, recent Supreme Court decisions have redefined\n\nEleventh Amendment jurisprudence in a variety of ways. E.g., Alden\n\nv. Maine, 527 U.S. 706, 712-15 (1999); Fla. Prepaid Postsecondary\n\nEduc. Expense Bd. v. Coll. Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. 627, 635-36 (1999);\n\nIdaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe, 521 U.S. 261, 267-70, 281-82 (1997).\n\nWe have termed this movement a \"sea change\" in constitutional\n\ndoctrine.   Jusino Mercado v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, 214 F.3d\n\n34, 38 (1st Cir. 2000).    But even sea changes have limited (albeit\n\nsignificant) effects — and the Supreme Court has not yet signaled\n\na   willingness   to   curtail   the   Ex   parte   Young   exception   as\n\ndrastically as the defendants suggest.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      We assume, without deciding, that the defendants are correct\nin their assertion that section 1396a(a)(3) offers remedies that\nare narrower than the prospective injunctive relief available under\nEx parte Young. It is unsettling, however, that the defendants\nbase this assertion in large measure on the regulations that\nimplement the statute — 42 C.F.R. §§ 431.200-250 — rather than on\nthe statutory text. In both Seminole Tribe and Verizon, the Court\nlooked only at the statutory language, not at any accompanying\nregulations. That may well be significant, as regulatory language\nis not invariably a reliable guide to congressional intent.\n\n                                  -10-\n\f             The fatal flaw in the defendants' argument lies in their\n\nmisreading of Seminole Tribe.           The Supreme Court did not, as the\n\ndefendants    would   have   it,      place    primacy      on   the     presence      of\n\nstatutory limitations on remedies.               Rather, the Court read the\n\nremedial limitations imposed by the IGRA merely as a clue from\n\nwhich to deduce congressional intent. See Seminole Tribe, 517 U.S.\n\nat 75-76 (explaining that Congress's decision \"to impose upon the\n\nState a liability that is significantly more limited than would be\n\nthe liability imposed upon the state officer under Ex parte Young\n\nstrongly   indicates    that     Congress      had    no    wish    to      create    the\n\nlatter\"). Thus, the nature and scope of the IGRA's remedial scheme\n\nwas instrumental in the Court's ruling only to the extent that\n\nthose attributes spoke to congressional intent.                    And in terms of\n\nthat intent, the key factors in Seminole Tribe were the intricacy\n\nand detail of the statute's remedial scheme.                Id. at 74.         In other\n\nwords, it was the comprehensiveness of the remedial scheme that\n\nsuggested an intention to pretermit Ex parte Young relief. See id.\n\n            Perscrutation       of    the     Court's      decision      in    Verizon\n\nreinforces this point. The Verizon Court emphasized the centrality\n\nof congressional intent, basing its decision on whether \"the 1996\n\n[Telecommunications]      Act    display[ed]         any   intent      to     foreclose\n\njurisdiction under Ex parte Young.\"               122 S. Ct. at 1761.                 The\n\nCourt's    passing    mention    of    limited       remedies      served      only    to\n\nhighlight Congress's apparent motive.\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f            Properly read, Seminole Tribe and Verizon provide clear\n\nguideposts as to how lower courts should approach the inquiry into\n\ncongressional intent.       In each instance, the Court placed great\n\nemphasis on the detail and intricacy of the underlying statute's\n\nremedial scheme as indicators of congressional intent.           Following\n\nthis train of thought, the Seminole Tribe Court concluded that \"the\n\nintricate procedures set forth in [the IGRA] show that Congress\n\nintended    therein   not   only   to     define,   but   also   to   limit\n\nsignificantly, the [available remedies].\"           517 U.S. at 74.    The\n\nCourt similarly keyed the more general proposition on statutory\n\ndetail:    \"where Congress has prescribed a detailed remedial scheme\n\nfor the enforcement against a State of a statutorily created right,\n\na court should hesitate before casting aside those limitations and\n\npermitting an action against a state officer based upon Ex parte\n\nYoung.\"     Id.   So too Verizon, 122 S. Ct. at 1761, in which the\n\nCourt compared the level of detail and intricacy of the IGRA with\n\nthe 1996 Telecommunications Act and found the latter insufficient\n\nto betoken an intent to foreclose Ex parte Young relief.\n\n            The short of it is that, as the defendants suggest,\n\nSeminole Tribe and Verizon provide a roadmap for testing the\n\ncontinued vitality of the Ex parte Young exception on any given set\n\nof facts.     But contrary to the defendants' importunings,5 that\n\n\n     5\n      We note at this juncture that the defendants' reading of\nSeminole Tribe is in direct conflict with the Court's statement\nthere that \"we do not hold that Congress cannot authorize federal\n\n                                   -12-\n\froadmap      directs      us     to      pay        particular       attention      to\n\ncomprehensiveness, that is, statutory detail and intricacy, as one\n\nindication of congressional intent as it pertains to the Ex parte\n\nYoung exception.       Applying this mode of analysis to the case at bar\n\nyields a straightforward result.\n\n             The   Medicaid    Act     contains       no    comprehensive     set   of\n\nremedies.     The single artifact relied upon by the defendants — the\n\nfair   hearing     provision   —      does    not     approach   the    standard    of\n\ncomprehensiveness required under Seminole Tribe and Verizon as a\n\nbasis for trumping Ex parte Young.                  Rather, section 1396a(a)(3)\n\nmerely guarantees a fair hearing to Medicaid beneficiaries.                         It\n\nneither offers any detail as to how states must conduct such\n\nhearings nor erects any ancillary remedial structures.                      This lies\n\nin sharp contrast to the IGRA, 25 U.S.C. § 2710(d)(3), a statute\n\nsetting forth a web of procedures \"prescrib[ing] that a court could\n\nissue an order directing the State to negotiate, that it could\n\nrequire the State to submit to mediation, and that it could order\n\nthat the Secretary of the Interior be notified.\"                     Verizon, 122 S.\n\nCt.    at   1761   (discussing     the       IGRA).        Indeed,    the   pertinent\n\nprovisions of the Telecommunications Act, 47 U.S.C. § 252(e)(6),\n\nwhich the Verizon Court found lacking in comprehensiveness (and,\n\nthus, inadequate to supplant an Ex parte Young action), 122 S. Ct.\n\n\njurisdiction under Ex parte Young over a cause of action with a\nlimited remedial scheme.\"    517 U.S. at 75 n.17 (emphasis in\noriginal).\n\n                                        -13-\n\fat 1761, afforded far more intricacy and detail than the Medicaid\n\nprovision at issue here.     Whereas section 252(e)(6) is tailored to\n\napply specific sections of the Telecommunications Act to certain\n\ndisputes, the Medicaid fair hearing reference is a standardless\n\ngenerality, open to interpretation by the states.\n\n          We add, moreover, that even aside from its lack of\n\ncomprehensiveness, section 1396a(a)(3) offers no intimation of a\n\ncongressional intent to foreclose other remedies.          The provision\n\nmerely requires states to provide Medicaid beneficiaries with a\n\nfair hearing to contest an agency decision (something that the Due\n\nProcess Clause might require in any case).\n\n          For these reasons, we hold that the Eleventh Amendment\n\ndoes not prevent Medicaid beneficiaries from seeking prospective\n\ninjunctive relief against state officials in a federal court.           In\n\nso holding, we preserve three decades of case law refusing to\n\nconstrue the Eleventh Amendment to prohibit suits for prospective\n\ninjunctive relief involving Title XIX of the Social Security Act.\n\nE.g., Wilder v. Va. Hosp. Ass'n, 496 U.S. 498, 521-22 (1990)\n\n(permitting   suit    against   state      Medicare   intermediaries   in\n\nconnection with hospital reimbursement); Maine v. Thiboutout, 448\n\nU.S. 1, 5-6 (1980) (permitting suit against officials distributing\n\nAFDC payments); Rosado v. Wyman, 397 U.S. 397, 405-06 (1970)\n\n(permitting   suit   by   welfare   recipients   against   state   welfare\n\nadministrators); Visiting Nurse Ass'n of N. Shore, Inc. v. Bullen,\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\f93 F.3d 997, 1002-05 (1st Cir. 1996) (permitting suit by health\n\ncare       providers   against   Medicaid   program   officials   over\n\nreimbursement rates); Mass. Ass'n of Older Ams. v. Sharp, 700 F.2d\n\n749, 750-52 (1st Cir. 1983) (permitting suit by families to prevent\n\ntermination of Medicaid benefits vis-à-vis stepchildren).         That\n\njurisprudence includes several cases holding that the Eleventh\n\nAmendment does not bar suits seeking prospective injunctive relief\n\nagainst state actors relative to EPSDT benefits. E.g., Mitchell v.\n\nJohnston, 701 F.2d 337, 344 (5th Cir. 1983); Stanton v. Bond, 504\n\nF.2d 1246, 1251 (7th Cir. 1974).     This line of cases seems solidly\n\nembedded in constitutional terrain left undisturbed by Seminole\n\nTribe.      Reversing these precedents would require a dramatic — and\n\nunwarranted — departure from both the common understanding of Ex\n\nparte Young and its historic role in administering the Social\n\nSecurity Act.6\n\n              We note, too, that our holding today aligns us with a\n\nbroad coalition of other courts which, subsequent to Seminole\n\nTribe, have rejected similar arguments aimed at barring suits for\n\nprospective injunctive relief commenced by Medicaid beneficiaries\n\nagainst state actors.     See, e.g., Frazar v. Gilbert, 300 F.3d 530,\n\n\n       6\n      Although the defendants seek support for such a departure in\na recent decision of this court, see Greenless v. Almond, 277 F.3d\n601 (1st Cir. 2002), that case offers them no succor. There, we\ndismissed a private claim under the Medicaid statute on the basis\nof statutory interpretation.     Id. at 608-09.     We explicitly\nrefrained from ruling on the question of sovereign immunity. Id.\nat 606-07.\n\n                                   -15-\n\f550-51 & n.109 (5th Cir. 2002) (concluding that the Medicaid Act\n\ndoes   not    possess   an   intricate   remedial   scheme   regulating\n\nnoncompliance by states and permitting Ex parte Young action on\n\nbehalf of Medicaid beneficiaries to secure EPSDT benefits); Mo.\n\nChild Care Ass'n v. Cross, 294 F.3d 1034, 1038 (8th Cir. 2002)\n\n(concluding \"that the [Child Welfare Act of 1980, Title IV-E of the\n\nSocial Security Act] does not reflect any intent to limit Ex parte\n\nYoung actions\"); Antrican v. Odom, 290 F.3d 178, 190 (4th Cir.\n\n2002) (holding that \"the Medicaid Act does not provide the type of\n\ndetailed remedial scheme that would supplant an Ex parte Young\n\naction\"); Westside Mothers v. Haveman, 289 F.3d 852, 862 (6th Cir.\n\n2002) (holding that the Medicaid Act provision allowing reduction\n\nof funds to noncompliant states \"is not a detailed 'remedial'\n\nscheme sufficient to show Congress's intent to preempt an action\n\nunder Ex parte Young\"); Joseph A. ex rel. Corrine Wolfe v. Ingram,\n\n275 F.3d 1253, 1264 (10th Cir. 2002) (explaining that neither the\n\nAdoption and Safe Families Act nor the Adoption Assistance and\n\nChild Welfare Act \"provide remedial schemes sufficient to foreclose\n\nEx parte Young jurisdiction\").\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n             We need go no further. To recapitulate, we conclude that\n\nin determining whether a statute's remedial provisions preclude\n\nprospective injunctive relief under the doctrine of Ex parte Young,\n\nthe proper test involves an inquiry into Congress's intent.      Here,\n\n\n                                  -16-\n\fthat inquiry centers on determining whether the remedial scheme is\n\nsufficiently comprehensive to indicate that Congress intended to\n\nforeclose such relief.     The fair hearing requirement set forth in\n\n42   U.S.C.   §   1396a(a)(3)   falls   well   short   of   this   benchmark.\n\nConsequently, Ex parte Young controls.           We conclude, therefore,\n\nthat the buckler of Eleventh Amendment immunity does not protect\n\nstate officials from federal court suits for prospective injunctive\n\nrelief under the Medicaid Act.          The plaintiffs thus may proceed\n\nwith the prosecution of the instant action.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\f",

This appeal represents an attempt by the named defendants &#8212; a complement of Massachusetts officials, including the governor, two cabinet officers, and the Commissioner of the Division of Medical Assistance &#8212; to capitalize upon that trend. As we explain below, they seek to push the envelope too far.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with basics. In this class action, the plaintiffs seek prospective injunctive relief to vindicate their view that the federal Medicaid Act requires Massachusetts to provide home-based mental health services to Medicaid-eligible children. The defendants resist the plaintiffs' interpretation of the Medicaid Act. As a preliminary matter, however, they claim that the Eleventh Amendment bars the prosecution of the plaintiffs' action in a federal court (and, thus, obviates any need to address the substantive question).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court rejected the defendants' Eleventh Amendment sortie, and the defendants thereupon filed this interlocutory appeal. We affirm the district court's ruling. While recent Supreme Court decisions have made some inroads on the venerable doctrine of <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. 123, 28 S.Ct. 441, 52 L.Ed. 714 (1908), they have not eviscerated that doctrine, and only very narrow exceptions infringe on the well established right to ask for prospective injunctive relief against state officials in a federal forum. Consequently, the Eleventh Amendment does not preclude the maintenance of this action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress created the Medicaid program, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1396-1396v, in 1965. Over time, it augmented the program's coverage to provide early and periodic screening, diagnosis and treatment (EPSDT) services to Medicaid-eligible children. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1396a(a)(10), 1396a(a)(43), 1396d(a)(4)(B), 1396d(r)(5). Congress intended that these revisions would give children access to preventive health care (e.g., vision, hearing, and dental services), preempt the onset of childhood illness, and identify children with disabilities in need of early attention. <i>See, e.g.,</i> H.R.Rep. No. 101-247, at &#167;&#167; 395-401 (1989), <i>reprinted in</i> 1989 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1906, 2121-2127; S.Rep. No. 90-744, at &#167; II-G (1967), <i>reprinted in</i> 1967 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2834, 2869-2871. The EPSDT reforms enacted by Congress in 1989 (as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, Pub.L. No. 101-239, 103 Stat. 2106) were particularly noteworthy in two pertinent respects. First, Congress obligated participating states to provide a comprehensive package of preventive services that met reasonable standards of medical necessity. 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1396a(a)(43), 1396d(r). Second, Congress expanded EPSDT services to include \"[s]uch other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures described [as medical assistance] to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not such services are covered under the State plan.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1396d(r)(5). In effect, these amendments required states to provide Medicaid coverage for any service \"identified as medically necessary through the EPSDT program.\" 135 Cong. Rec. S6899, 6900 (daily ed. June 19, 1989) (statement of Sen. Chafee).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case before us arises out of a dispute over the Commonwealth's obligations under sections 1396a(a)(43) and 1396d(r)(5). The plaintiffs are nine Medicaid-eligible children, acting through their parents or guardians, who seek to compel the Commonwealth to furnish them with home-based mental health services. Although their particular ailments vary, each plaintiff has been diagnosed with a severe psychiatric or behavioral disorder. These debilitating conditions have led to a wide array of unhappy results, including expulsions from schools, cyclical transfers between treating facilities, repeated hospitalizations, and years spent away from family members at crisis stabilization units.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the plaintiffs' view, the Massachusetts Medicaid program, as presently administered, relies almost exclusively on institution-based psychiatric care. The plaintiffs allege that such a narrowly focused treatment regime cannot rehabilitate (and, indeed, may exacerbate) their conditions; that home-based psychiatric care is medically necessary for effective treatment; that the Commonwealth, notwithstanding its clear statutory obligation to provide such services, has taken no action; and that its lethargy flies in the face of the EPSDT mandates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To right these perceived wrongs, the plaintiffs invoked 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and brought suit in federal district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> They claim to represent thousands of Medicaid-eligible children, resident in Massachusetts, who suffer from similarly severe behavioral, emotional, and psychiatric disorders and who require home-based care. The gravamen of their complaint is that the Medicaid statute entitles the members of the putative class to, and obligates the Commonwealth to provide, intensive home-based mental health services. They further allege that the defendants' persistent denial of such medically necessary treatment has created a \"mental health crisis\" within Massachusetts. On this basis, they ask the district court to order the defendants to reform the Massachusetts Medicaid program to include the home-based mental health care that the EPSDT provisions allegedly require.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved to dismiss the action on three grounds. First, they claim that the Commonwealth's sovereign immunity, enshrined in the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution, bars the suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Second, they assert that the EPSDT provisions of the Medicaid Act do not create private rights enforceable under section 1983. Third, they posit that the plaintiffs' complaint fails to state an actionable claim. The plaintiffs opposed this motion and the district court, ruling <i>ore sponte,</i> denied it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants responded by filing this interlocutory appeal. The appeal is proper as to the Eleventh Amendment issue, as pretrial orders granting or denying Eleventh Amendment immunity are immediately appealable. <i>See P.R. Aqueduct &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.,</i> 506 U.S. 139, 141, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993). We affirm the district court's ruling as it pertains to the issue of Eleventh Amendment immunity. The other facets of the order denying the motion to dismiss are not ripe for review, and we express no opinion as to those issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general matter, the Eleventh Amendment bars suits in federal courts against unconsenting states (including \"official capacity\" suits against state hierarchs). <i>De Leon Lopez v. Corporacion Insular de Seguros,</i> 931 F.2d 116, 121 (1st Cir.1991) (collecting cases). This proscription is subject to a well recognized exception memorialized in <i>Ex parte Young,</i> 209 U.S. at 159-60, 28 S.Ct. 441. The exception allows federal courts, \"notwithstanding the absence of consent, waiver or evidence of congressional assertion of national hegemony, [to] enjoin state officials to conform future conduct to the requirements of federal law.\" <i>Lane v. First Nat'l Bank,</i> 871 F.2d 166, 172 n. 5 (1st Cir.1989) (quoting <i>Ramirez v. P.R. Fire Serv.,</i> 715 F.2d 694, 697 (1st Cir.1983)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For nearly a century, the doctrine of <i>Ex parte Young</i> flourished and suits against state officials seeking prospective injunctive relief were commonplace. <i>E.g., Quern v. Jordan,</i> 440 U.S. 332, 346-47, 99 S.Ct. 1139, 59 L.Ed.2d 358 (1979); <i>Ramirez,</i> 715 F.2d at 697; <i>Coalition for Basic Human Needs v. King,</i> 654 F.2d 838, 842 (1st Cir.1981) (per curiam). Lately, however, the Supreme Court has fashioned an exception to the exception, applicable to certain cases in which \"Congress has created a remedial scheme for the enforcement of a particular federal right.\" <i>Seminole Tribe v. Florida,</i> 517 U.S. 44, 74, 116 S.Ct. 1114, 134 L.Ed.2d 252 (1996). Since the plaintiffs here sue only for prospective injunctive relief, and do so under the imprimatur of <i>Ex parte Young,</i> this case requires us to evaluate, for the first time, the extent to which <i>Seminole Tribe</i> has narrowed the <i>Ex parte Young</i> exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The litigants sketch the suggested contours of this new limitation in very different ways. The plaintiffs (and the amici) view <i>Seminole Tribe</i> as a <i>rara avis,</i> asserting that it relates only to those few federal statutes that contain comprehensive remedial schemes, and otherwise leaves the doctrine of <i>Ex parte Young</i> alive and well. The defendants contend that the <i>Seminole Tribe</i> constraint applies much more broadly. They tell us that, under <i>Seminole Tribe,</i> the inquiry into the applicability of <i>Ex parte Young</i> in any given case turns upon a comparison between the remedies conferred by the statute governing the dispute and the judicial remedies available under <i>Ex parte Young;</i> whenever the statute provides anodynes that are more limited than those allowed under <i>Ex parte Young,</i> a complainant's redress is restricted to the former (and, accordingly, <i>Ex parte Young</i> becomes a dead letter).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of analysis, we turn directly to the defendants' argument. The defendants base their assessment of the diminished efficacy of the <i>Ex parte Young</i> exception on their reading of two recent Supreme Court cases. They asseverate that, in <i>Seminole Tribe,</i> the Court examined the remedial provisions created by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), 25 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2701-2721, and asked whether those remedies were more circumscribed than the relief available under <i>Ex parte Young. Seminole Tribe,</i> 517 U.S. at 74-75, 116 S.Ct. 1114. The defendants also contend that in a subsequent case, <i>Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 1753, 1761, 152 L.Ed.2d 871 (2002), the Court undertook a similar inquiry with respect to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56 (codified, as amended, in scattered sections, chiefly in 47 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 151-615). Building on this foundation, the defendants argue that <i>Ex parte Young</i> remains ascendant only when the applicable statute authorizes a set of remedies more far-reaching than prospective injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clinging to this approach, the defendants visualize the case at hand through the prism of the \"fair hearing\" requirement of the Medicaid statute, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(3). That provision, nestled among a long list of requirements imposed on state plans,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> declares tersely that \"[a] State plan for medical assistance must ... provide for granting an opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency to any individual whose claim for medical assistance under the plan is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness.\" According to the defendants, this language supplies a remedy (a fair hearing) more limited than that available under <i>Ex parte Young</i> (prospective injunctive relief), and, thus, precludes the use of <i>Ex parte Young</i> as an instrument for piercing the shield of the Commonwealth's Eleventh Amendment immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, recent Supreme Court decisions have redefined Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence in a variety of ways. <i>E.g., Alden v. Maine,</i> 527 U.S. 706, 712-15, 119 S.Ct. 2240, 144 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999); <i>Fla. Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense Bd. v. Coll. Sav. Bank,</i> 527 U.S. 627, 635-36, 119 S.Ct. 2199, 144 L.Ed.2d 575 (1999); <i>Idaho v. Coeur d'Alene Tribe,</i> 521 U.S. 261, 267-70, 281-82, 117 S.Ct. 2028, 138 L.Ed.2d 438 (1997). We have termed this movement a \"sea change\" in constitutional doctrine. <i>Jusino Mercado v. Commonwealth of Puerto Rico,</i> 214 F.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir.2000). But even sea changes have limited (albeit significant) effects &#8212; and the Supreme Court has not yet signaled a willingness to curtail the <i>Ex parte Young</i> exception as drastically as the defendants suggest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fatal flaw in the defendants' argument lies in their misreading of <i>Seminole Tribe.</i> The Supreme Court did not, as the defendants would have it, place primacy on the presence of statutory limitations on remedies. Rather, the Court read the remedial limitations imposed by the IGRA merely as a clue from which to deduce congressional intent. <i>See Seminole Tribe,</i> 517 U.S. at 75-76, 116 S.Ct. 1114 (explaining that Congress's decision \"to impose upon the State a liability that is significantly more limited than would be the liability imposed upon the state officer under <i>Ex parte Young</i> strongly indicates that Congress had no wish to create the latter\"). Thus, the nature and scope of the IGRA's remedial scheme was instrumental in the Court's ruling only to the extent that those attributes spoke to congressional intent. And in terms of that intent, the key factors in <i>Seminole Tribe</i> were the intricacy and detail of the statute's remedial scheme. <i>Id.</i> at 74. In other words, it was the <i>comprehensiveness</i> of the remedial scheme that suggested an intention to pretermit <i>Ex parte Young</i> relief. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perscrutation of the Court's decision in <i>Verizon</i> reinforces this point. The <i>Verizon</i> Court emphasized the centrality of congressional intent, basing its decision on whether \"the 1996 [Telecommunications] Act display[ed] any intent to foreclose jurisdiction under <i>Ex parte Young.</i>\" ___ U.S. at ___, 122 S.Ct. at 1761. The Court's passing mention of limited remedies served only to highlight Congress's apparent motive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Properly read, <i>Seminole Tribe</i> and <i>Verizon</i> provide clear guideposts as to how lower courts should approach the inquiry into congressional intent. In each instance, the Court placed great emphasis on the detail and intricacy of the underlying statute's remedial scheme as indicators of congressional intent. Following this train of thought, the <i>Seminole Tribe</i> Court concluded that \"the intricate procedures set forth in [the IGRA] show that Congress intended therein not only to define, but also to limit significantly, the [available remedies].\" 517 U.S. at 74, 116 S.Ct. 1114. The Court similarly keyed the more general proposition on statutory detail: \"where Congress has prescribed a detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against a State of a statutorily created right, a court should hesitate before casting aside those limitations and permitting an action against a state officer based upon <i>Ex parte Young.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> So too <i>Verizon,</i> ___ U.S. at ___, 122 S.Ct. at 1761, in which the Court compared the level of detail and intricacy of the IGRA with the 1996 Telecommunications Act and found the latter insufficient to betoken an intent to foreclose <i>Ex parte Young</i> relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that, as the defendants suggest, <i>Seminole Tribe</i> and <i>Verizon</i> provide a roadmap for testing the continued vitality of the <i>Ex parte Young</i> exception on any given set of facts. But contrary to the defendants' importunings,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> that roadmap directs us to pay particular attention to comprehensiveness, that is, statutory detail and intricacy, as one indication of congressional intent as it pertains to the <i>Ex parte Young</i> exception. Applying this mode of analysis to the case at bar yields a straightforward result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Medicaid Act contains no comprehensive set of remedies. The single artifact relied upon by the defendants &#8212; the fair hearing provision &#8212; does not approach the standard of comprehensiveness required under <i>Seminole Tribe</i> and <i>Verizon</i> as a basis for trumping <i>Ex parte Young.</i> Rather, section 1396a(a)(3) merely guarantees a fair hearing to Medicaid beneficiaries. It neither offers any detail as to how states must conduct such hearings nor erects any ancillary remedial structures. This lies in sharp contrast to the IGRA, 25 U.S.C. &#167; 2710(d)(3), a statute setting forth a web of procedures \"prescrib[ing] that a court could issue an order directing the State to negotiate, that it could require the State to submit to mediation, and that it could order that the Secretary of the Interior be notified.\" <i>Verizon,</i> ___ U.S. at ___, 122 S.Ct. at 1761 (discussing the IGRA). Indeed, the pertinent provisions of the Telecommunications Act, 47 U.S.C. &#167; 252(e)(6), which the <i>Verizon</i> Court found lacking in comprehensiveness (and, thus, inadequate to supplant an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action), ___ U.S. at ___, 122 S.Ct. at 1761, afforded far more intricacy and detail than the Medicaid provision at issue here. Whereas section 252(e)(6) is tailored to apply specific sections of the Telecommunications Act to certain disputes, the Medicaid fair hearing reference is a standardless generality, open to interpretation by the states.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that even aside from its lack of comprehensiveness, section 1396a(a)(3) offers no intimation of a congressional intent to foreclose other remedies. The provision merely requires states to provide Medicaid beneficiaries with a fair hearing to contest an agency decision (something that the Due Process Clause might require in any case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we hold that the Eleventh Amendment does not prevent Medicaid beneficiaries from seeking prospective injunctive relief against state officials in a federal court. In so holding, we preserve three decades of case law refusing to construe the Eleventh Amendment to prohibit suits for prospective injunctive relief involving Title XIX of the Social Security Act. <i>E.g., Wilder v. Va. Hosp. Ass'n,</i> 496 U.S. 498, 521-22, 110 S.Ct. 2510, 110 L.Ed.2d 455 (1990) (permitting suit against state Medicare intermediaries in connection with hospital reimbursement); <i>Maine v. Thiboutot,</i> 448 U.S. 1, 5-6, 100 S.Ct. 2502, 65 L.Ed.2d 555 (1980) (permitting suit against officials distributing AFDC payments); <i>Rosado v. Wyman,</i> 397 U.S. 397, 405-06, 90 S.Ct. 1207, 25 L.Ed.2d 442 (1970) (permitting suit by welfare recipients against state welfare administrators); <i>Visiting Nurse Ass'n of N. Shore, Inc. v. Bullen,</i> 93 F.3d 997, 1002-05 (1st Cir.1996) (permitting suit by health care providers against Medicaid program officials over reimbursement rates); <i>Mass. Ass'n of Older Ams. v. Sharp,</i> 700 F.2d 749, 750-52 (1st Cir.1983) (permitting suit by families to prevent termination of Medicaid benefits vis-&#224;-vis stepchildren). That jurisprudence includes several cases holding that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar suits seeking prospective injunctive relief against state actors relative to EPSDT benefits. <i>E.g., Mitchell v. Johnston,</i> 701 F.2d 337, 344 (5th Cir.1983); <i>Stanton v. Bond,</i> 504 F.2d 1246, 1251 (7th Cir.1974). This line of cases seems solidly embedded in constitutional terrain left undisturbed by <i>Seminole Tribe.</i> Reversing these precedents would require a dramatic &#8212; and unwarranted &#8212; departure from both the common understanding of <i>Ex parte Young</i> and its historic role in administering the Social Security Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, too, that our holding today aligns us with a broad coalition of other courts which, subsequent to <i>Seminole Tribe,</i> have rejected similar arguments aimed at barring suits for prospective injunctive relief commenced by Medicaid beneficiaries against state actors. <i>See, e.g., Frazar v. Gilbert,</i> 300 F.3d 530, 550-51 &amp; n. 109 (5th Cir.2002) (concluding that the Medicaid Act does not possess an intricate remedial scheme regulating noncompliance by states and permitting <i>Ex parte Young</i> action on behalf of Medicaid beneficiaries to secure EPSDT benefits); <i>Mo. Child Care Ass'n v. Cross,</i> 294 F.3d 1034, 1038 (8th Cir.2002) (concluding \"that the [Child Welfare Act of 1980, Title IV-E of the Social Security Act] does not reflect any intent to limit <i>Ex parte Young</i> actions\"); <i>Antrican v. Odom,</i> 290 F.3d 178, 190 (4th Cir.2002) (holding that \"the Medicaid Act does not provide the type of detailed remedial scheme that would supplant an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action\"); <i>Westside Mothers v. Haveman,</i> 289 F.3d 852, 862 (6th Cir.2002) (holding that the Medicaid Act provision allowing reduction of funds to noncompliant states \"is not a detailed `remedial' scheme sufficient to show Congress's intent to preempt an action under <i>Ex parte Young</i>\"); <i>Joseph A. ex rel. Corrine Wolfe v. Ingram,</i> 275 F.3d 1253, 1264 (10th Cir.2002) (explaining that neither the Adoption and Safe Families Act nor the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act \"provide remedial schemes sufficient to foreclose <i>Ex parte Young</i> jurisdiction\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. To recapitulate, we conclude that in determining whether a statute's remedial provisions preclude prospective injunctive relief under the doctrine of <i>Ex parte Young,</i> the proper test involves an inquiry into Congress's intent. Here, that inquiry centers on determining whether the remedial scheme is sufficiently comprehensive to indicate that Congress intended to foreclose such relief. The fair hearing requirement set forth in 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(3) falls well short of this benchmark. Consequently, <i>Ex parte Young</i> controls. We conclude, therefore, that the buckler of Eleventh Amendment immunity does not protect state officials from federal court suits for prospective injunctive relief under the Medicaid Act. The plaintiffs thus may proceed with the prosecution of the instant action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.

This appeal represents an attempt by the named defendants &#8212; a complement of Massachusetts officials, including the governor, two cabinet officers, and the Commissioner of the Division of Medical Assistance &#8212; to capitalize upon that trend. As we explain below, they seek to push the envelope too far.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with basics. In this class action, the plaintiffs seek prospective injunctive relief to vindicate their view that the federal Medicaid Act requires Massachusetts to provide home-based mental health services to Medicaid-eligible children. The defendants resist the plaintiffs' interpretation of the Medicaid Act.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Congress created the Medicaid program, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1396-1396v, in 1965. Over time, it augmented the program's coverage to provide early and periodic screening, diagnosis and treatment (EPSDT) services to Medicaid-eligible children. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1396a(a)(10), 1396a(a)(43), 1396d(a)(4)(B), 1396d(r)(5). Congress intended that these revisions would give children access to preventive health care (e.g., vision, hearing, and dental services), preempt the onset of childhood illness, and identify children with disabilities in need of early attention. <i>See, e.g.,</i> H.R.Rep. No. 101-247, at &#167;&#167; 395-401 (1989), <i>reprinted in</i> 1989 U.S.C.C.A.N. 1906, 2121-2127; S.Rep. No. 90-744, at &#167; II-G (1967), <i>reprinted in</i> 1967 U.S.C.C.A.N. 2834, 2869-2871. The EPSDT reforms enacted by Congress in 1989 (as part of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1989, Pub.L. No. 101-239, 103 Stat. 2106) were particularly noteworthy in two pertinent respects. First, Congress obligated participating states to provide a comprehensive package of preventive services that met reasonable standards of medical necessity. 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1396a(a)(43), 1396d(r). Second, Congress expanded EPSDT services to include \"[s]uch other necessary health care, diagnostic services, treatment, and other measures described [as medical assistance] to correct or ameliorate defects and physical and mental illnesses and conditions discovered by the screening services, whether or not such services are covered under the State plan.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1396d(r)(5). In effect, these amendments required states to provide Medicaid coverage for any service \"identified as medically necessary through the EPSDT program.\" 135 Cong. Rec. S6899, 6900 (daily ed. June 19, 1989) (statement of Sen. Chafee).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case before us arises out of a dispute over the Commonwealth's obligations under sections 1396a(a)(43) and 1396d(r)(5). The plaintiffs are nine Medicaid-eligible children, acting through their parents or guardians, who seek to compel the Commonwealth to furnish them with home-based mental health services. Although their particular ailments vary, each plaintiff has been diagnosed with a severe psychiatric or behavioral disorder. These debilitating conditions have led to a wide array of unhappy results, including expulsions from schools, cyclical transfers between treating facilities, repeated hospitalizations, and years spent away from family members at crisis stabilization units.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the plaintiffs' view, the Massachusetts Medicaid program, as presently administered, relies almost exclusively on institution-based psychiatric care. The plaintiffs allege that such a narrowly focused treatment regime cannot rehabilitate (and, indeed, may exacerbate) their conditions; that home-based psychiatric care is medically necessary for effective treatment; that the Commonwealth, notwithstanding its clear statutory obligation to provide such services, has taken no action; and that its lethargy flies in the face of the EPSDT mandates.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To right these perceived wrongs, the plaintiffs invoked 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983 and brought suit in federal district court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> They claim to represent thousands of Medicaid-eligible children, resident in Massachusetts, who suffer from similarly severe behavioral, emotional, and psychiatric disorders and who require home-based care. The gravamen of their complaint is that the Medicaid statute entitles the members of the putative class to, and obligates the Commonwealth to provide, intensive home-based mental health services. They further allege that the defendants' persistent denial of such medically necessary treatment has created a \"mental health crisis\" within Massachusetts. On this basis, they ask the district court to order the defendants to reform the Massachusetts Medicaid program to include the home-based mental health care that the EPSDT provisions allegedly require.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants moved to dismiss the action on three grounds. First, they claim that the Commonwealth's sovereign immunity, enshrined in the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution, bars the suit.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Second, they assert that the EPSDT provisions of the Medicaid Act do not create private rights enforceable under section 1983. Third, they posit that the plaintiffs' complaint fails to state an actionable claim. The plaintiffs opposed this motion and the district court, ruling <i>ore sponte,</i> denied it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants responded by filing this interlocutory appeal.

Lately, however, the Supreme Court has fashioned an exception to the exception, applicable to certain cases in which \"Congress has created a remedial scheme for the enforcement of a particular federal right.\" <i>Seminole Tribe v. Florida,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118011\"><a href=\"/opinion/118011/seminole-tribe-of-fla-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118011\"><a href=\"/opinion/118011/seminole-tribe-of-fla-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">252</span></a></span> (1996). Since the plaintiffs here sue only for prospective injunctive relief, and do so under the imprimatur of <i>Ex parte Young,</i> this case requires us to evaluate, for the first time, the extent to which <i>Seminole Tribe</i> has narrowed the <i>Ex parte Young</i> exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The litigants sketch the suggested contours of this new limitation in very different ways. The plaintiffs (and the amici) view <i>Seminole Tribe</i> as a <i>rara avis,</i> asserting that it relates only to those few federal statutes that contain comprehensive remedial schemes, and otherwise leaves the doctrine of <i>Ex parte Young</i> alive and well. The defendants contend that the <i>Seminole Tribe</i> constraint applies much more broadly. They tell us that, under <i>Seminole Tribe,</i> the inquiry into the applicability of <i>Ex parte Young</i> in any given case turns upon a comparison between the remedies conferred by the statute governing the dispute and the judicial remedies available under <i>Ex parte Young;</i> whenever the statute provides anodynes that are more limited than those allowed under <i>Ex parte Young,</i> a complainant's redress is restricted to the former (and, accordingly, <i>Ex parte Young</i> becomes a dead letter).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For purposes of analysis, we turn directly to the defendants' argument. The defendants base their assessment of the diminished efficacy of the <i>Ex parte Young</i> exception on their reading of two recent Supreme Court cases. They asseverate that, in <i>Seminole Tribe,</i> the Court examined the remedial provisions created by the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act (IGRA), 25 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 2701-2721, and asked whether those remedies were more circumscribed than the relief available under <i>Ex parte Young. Seminole Tribe,</i> 517 U.S. at 74-75, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118011\"><a href=\"/opinion/118011/seminole-tribe-of-fla-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1114</span></a></span>. The defendants also contend that in a subsequent case, <i>Verizon Md., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118506\"><a href=\"/opinion/118506/verizon-maryland-inc-v-public-service-commission-of-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">122</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">871</span></a></span> (2002), the Court undertook a similar inquiry with respect to the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub.L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56 (codified, as amended, in scattered sections, chiefly in 47 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 151-615). Building on this foundation, the defendants argue that <i>Ex parte Young</i> remains ascendant only when the applicable statute authorizes a set of remedies more far-reaching than prospective injunctive relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clinging to this approach, the defendants visualize the case at hand through the prism of the \"fair hearing\" requirement of the Medicaid statute, 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(3). That provision, nestled among a long list of requirements imposed on state plans,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> declares tersely that \"[a] State plan for medical assistance must ... provide for granting an opportunity for a fair hearing before the State agency to any individual whose claim for medical assistance under the plan is denied or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness.\" According to the defendants, this language supplies a remedy (a fair hearing) more limited than that available under <i>Ex parte Young</i> (prospective injunctive relief), and, thus, precludes the use of <i>Ex parte Young</i> as an instrument for piercing the shield of the Commonwealth's Eleventh Amendment immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, recent Supreme Court decisions have redefined Eleventh Amendment jurisprudence in a variety of ways. <i>E.g., Alden v.

But even sea changes have limited (albeit significant) effects &#8212; and the Supreme Court has not yet signaled a willingness to curtail the <i>Ex parte Young</i> exception as drastically as the defendants suggest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The fatal flaw in the defendants' argument lies in their misreading of <i>Seminole Tribe.</i> The Supreme Court did not, as the defendants would have it, place primacy on the presence of statutory limitations on remedies. Rather, the Court read the remedial limitations imposed by the IGRA merely as a clue from which to deduce congressional intent. <i>See Seminole Tribe,</i> 517 U.S. at 75-76, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118011\"><a href=\"/opinion/118011/seminole-tribe-of-fla-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1114</span></a></span> (explaining that Congress's decision \"to impose upon the State a liability that is significantly more limited than would be the liability imposed upon the state officer under <i>Ex parte Young</i> strongly indicates that Congress had no wish to create the latter\"). Thus, the nature and scope of the IGRA's remedial scheme was instrumental in the Court's ruling only to the extent that those attributes spoke to congressional intent. And in terms of that intent, the key factors in <i>Seminole Tribe</i> were the intricacy and detail of the statute's remedial scheme. <i>Id.</i> at 74. In other words, it was the <i>comprehensiveness</i> of the remedial scheme that suggested an intention to pretermit <i>Ex parte Young</i> relief. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Perscrutation of the Court's decision in <i>Verizon</i> reinforces this point. The <i>Verizon</i> Court emphasized the centrality of congressional intent, basing its decision on whether \"the 1996 [Telecommunications] Act display[ed] any intent to foreclose jurisdiction under <i>Ex parte Young.</i>\" ___ U.S. at ___, 122 S.Ct. at 1761. The Court's passing mention of limited remedies served only to highlight Congress's apparent motive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Properly read, <i>Seminole Tribe</i> and <i>Verizon</i> provide clear guideposts as to how lower courts should approach the inquiry into congressional intent. In each instance, the Court placed great emphasis on the detail and intricacy of the underlying statute's remedial scheme as indicators of congressional intent. Following this train of thought, the <i>Seminole Tribe</i> Court concluded that \"the intricate procedures set forth in [the IGRA] show that Congress intended therein not only to define, but also to limit significantly, the [available remedies].\" 517 U.S. at 74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118011\"><a href=\"/opinion/118011/seminole-tribe-of-fla-v-florida/\"><span class=\"volume\">116</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1114</span></a></span>. The Court similarly keyed the more general proposition on statutory detail: \"where Congress has prescribed a detailed remedial scheme for the enforcement against a State of a statutorily created right, a court should hesitate before casting aside those limitations and permitting an action against a state officer based upon <i>Ex parte Young.</i>\" <i>Id.</i> So too <i>Verizon,</i> ___ U.S. at ___, 122 S.Ct. at 1761, in which the Court compared the level of detail and intricacy of the IGRA with the 1996 Telecommunications Act and found the latter insufficient to betoken an intent to foreclose <i>Ex parte Young</i> relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that, as the defendants suggest, <i>Seminole Tribe</i> and <i>Verizon</i> provide a roadmap for testing the continued vitality of the <i>Ex parte Young</i> exception on any given set of facts. But contrary to the defendants' importunings,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> that roadmap directs us to pay particular attention to comprehensiveness, that is, statutory detail and intricacy, as one indication of congressional intent as it pertains to the <i>Ex parte Young</i> exception. Applying this mode of analysis to the case at bar yields a straightforward result.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Medicaid Act contains no comprehensive set of remedies. The single artifact relied upon by the defendants &#8212; the fair hearing provision &#8212; does not approach the standard of comprehensiveness required under <i>Seminole Tribe</i> and <i>Verizon</i> as a basis for trumping <i>Ex parte Young.</i> Rather, section 1396a(a)(3) merely guarantees a fair hearing to Medicaid beneficiaries. It neither offers any detail as to how states must conduct such hearings nor erects any ancillary remedial structures. This lies in sharp contrast to the IGRA, 25 U.S.C. &#167; 2710(d)(3), a statute setting forth a web of procedures \"prescrib[ing] that a court could issue an order directing the State to negotiate, that it could require the State to submit to mediation, and that it could order that the Secretary of the Interior be notified.\" <i>Verizon,</i> ___ U.S. at ___, 122 S.Ct. at 1761 (discussing the IGRA). Indeed, the pertinent provisions of the Telecommunications Act, 47 U.S.C. &#167; 252(e)(6), which the <i>Verizon</i> Court found lacking in comprehensiveness (and, thus, inadequate to supplant an <i>Ex parte Young</i> action), ___ U.S. at ___, 122 S.Ct. at 1761, afforded far more intricacy and detail than the Medicaid provision at issue here. Whereas section 252(e)(6) is tailored to apply specific sections of the Telecommunications Act to certain disputes, the Medicaid fair hearing reference is a standardless generality, open to interpretation by the states.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that even aside from its lack of comprehensiveness, section 1396a(a)(3) offers no intimation of a congressional intent to foreclose other remedies. The provision merely requires states to provide Medicaid beneficiaries with a fair hearing to contest an agency decision (something that the Due Process Clause might require in any case).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we hold that the Eleventh Amendment does not prevent Medicaid beneficiaries from seeking prospective injunctive relief against state officials in a federal court. In so holding, we preserve three decades of case law refusing to construe the Eleventh Amendment to prohibit suits for prospective injunctive relief involving Title XIX of the Social Security Act. <i>E.g., Wilder v.

That jurisprudence includes several cases holding that the Eleventh Amendment does not bar suits seeking prospective injunctive relief against state actors relative to EPSDT benefits. <i>E.g., Mitchell v.

This line of cases seems solidly embedded in constitutional terrain left undisturbed by <i>Seminole Tribe.</i> Reversing these precedents would require a dramatic &#8212; and unwarranted &#8212; departure from both the common understanding of <i>Ex parte Young</i> and its historic role in administering the Social Security Act.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, too, that our holding today aligns us with a broad coalition of other courts which, subsequent to <i>Seminole Tribe,</i> have rejected similar arguments aimed at barring suits for prospective injunctive relief commenced by Medicaid beneficiaries against state actors. <i>See, e.g., Frazar v.

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. To recapitulate, we conclude that in determining whether a statute's remedial provisions preclude prospective injunctive relief under the doctrine of <i>Ex parte Young,</i> the proper test involves an inquiry into Congress's intent. Here, that inquiry centers on determining whether the remedial scheme is sufficiently comprehensive to indicate that Congress intended to foreclose such relief. The fair hearing requirement set forth in 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1396a(a)(3) falls well short of this benchmark. Consequently, <i>Ex parte Young</i> controls. We conclude, therefore, that the buckler of Eleventh Amendment immunity does not protect state officials from federal court suits for prospective injunctive relief under the Medicaid Act. The plaintiffs thus may proceed with the prosecution of the instant action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Hon.

In both <i>Seminole Tribe</i> and <i>Verizon,</i> the Court looked only at the statutory language, not at any accompanying regulations.
