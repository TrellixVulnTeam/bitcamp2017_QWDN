See Fed. R. App.\nP. 43(c).\n\f            SELYA, Senior Circuit Judge.            After the Department of\n\nHomeland Security (DHS), through its division of Citizenship and\n\nImmigration Services (CIS), denied a petition for renewal of a\n\nnonimmigrant specialty occupation visa, the petitioner, Royal Siam\n\nCorporation (RSC), together with the affected worker, Surasak\n\nSrisang, brought a civil action in the United States District Court\n\nfor the District of Puerto Rico in hopes of reversing CIS's\n\ndecision.    Those hopes were never realized.            After some procedural\n\nbacking and filling, the district court granted summary judgment in\n\nfavor of the defendants (all government agencies or actors).                 See\n\nRoyal Siam Corp. v. Ridge, 424 F. Supp. 2d 338 (D.P.R. 2006).               Upon\n\ncareful consideration of the plaintiffs' appeal, we affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n            We assume the reader's familiarity with the district\n\ncourt's opinion and, thus, content ourselves with a sketch of the\n\npertinent facts and travel of the case.\n\n            RSC owns and operates an upscale Thai restaurant in\n\nCarolina, Puerto Rico. On a petition filed by RSC's predecessor in\n\ninterest    in   1999,   Srisang    —   a   Thai   national   who   purportedly\n\npossessed    the   equivalent      of   a   bachelor's    degree    in   business\n\nadministration — received a specialty occupation visa (colloquially\n\nknown as an H-1B visa).         This nonimmigrant visa allowed him to\n\nenter the United States for a three-year period in order to work as\n\na restaurant manager.      Srisang availed himself of the opportunity.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f            In 2002, with Srisang's visa due to expire, RSC sought\n\nits renewal.      During the course of its review, CIS advised RSC of\n\nits doubts about the petition.        On October 24, 2002, the agency\n\nissued a request for additional proof, noting that the \"evidence\n\nsubmitted is not sufficient to establish that the job is specialty\n\nin scope.\"        Although RSC made a supplemental submission, CIS\n\neventually denied the petition.        On administrative review, CIS's\n\nappeals office upheld the denial.1\n\n            RSC    and   Srisang   thereupon   commenced   this   action,\n\nposturing it as a request for review of a final agency decision\n\nunder the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. §§ 701-706.\n\nIn their complaint, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\nThe district court stayed removal proceedings against Srisang.         In\n\ndue course, the court, while retaining jurisdiction, remanded the\n\ncase to CIS for a fuller explanation of its decision.       The district\n\ncourt found the cryptic quality of the original decision especially\n\ntroubling in light of the agency's 1999 approval of an H-1B visa\n\npetition for what the court deemed to be an \"equivalent position.\"\n\n            On remand, CIS reaffirmed its previous denial of the 2002\n\npetition.    In explaining its decision, CIS observed that it now\n\n\n     1\n      The authority to grant or deny petitions for specialty\noccupation visas, formerly exercised by the Attorney General and\nthe Immigration and Naturalization Service, now resides with DHS.\nSee Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 374 n.1 (2005); Lattab v.\nAshcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 13 n.2 (1st Cir. 2004).     For clarity of\nexposition, we refer to the appropriate bureau within DHS — CIS —\nregardless of when agency action occurred.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fregarded its grant of the 1999 petition (which rested on similar\n\ndata) as plainly erroneous because the job, as described by RSC's\n\npredecessor in interest, did not qualify as a specialty occupation.\n\nSee 8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), 1184(i); 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A).\n\nA   job   does    not   qualify   as   a   specialty    occupation     unless   it\n\nsatisfies    an    amalgam   of   criteria    that     relate    to   educational\n\nrequirements, complexity of the work, the specialized nature of the\n\nduties to be performed, and the like. See 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A).\n\nIn this case, the agency concluded that the proof submitted did not\n\nestablish that the restaurant manager position — either in 1999 or\n\nin 2002 — constituted a specialty occupation within the purview of\n\nthese criteria.\n\n            CIS's explanation did not stop there.               The agency noted\n\nthat its approval of the earlier petition had been erroneous for\n\nanother reason as well.       In 1998, CIS had found Srisang's marriage\n\nto a United States citizen fraudulent, that is, entered into for\n\nthe purpose of circumventing the immigration laws. Citing 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1154(c), CIS expressed the view that because Srisang had engaged\n\nin marriage fraud, he was \"statutorily ineligible\" for a specialty\n\noccupation visa.\n\n            The circumstances attendant to this alternate ground of\n\ndecision are not in dispute.           The marriage occurred in 1995.        As a\n\nresult, Srisang was conditionally granted lawful permanent resident\n\nstatus. In 1997, Srisang sought to make that status unconditional.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fFollowing   an   investigation,   however,   CIS   found    the   marriage\n\nfraudulent (a finding that Srisang does not now contest).         Withal,\n\nthe government's left hand obviously did not appreciate what the\n\nright hand was doing.      Although the marriage fraud finding was\n\nbrought to CIS's attention in connection with the 1999 specialty\n\noccupation visa petition, the agency had, in an apparent oversight,\n\napproved that petition.2\n\n            With CIS's detailed amplification of the binary grounds\n\nfor rejection of the 2002 visa petition in hand, the district court\n\nruled that the denial was neither arbitrary nor capricious.           See\n\nRoyal Siam, 424 F. Supp. 2d at 343.     Accordingly, the court entered\n\nsummary judgment in the defendants' favor.          This timely appeal\n\nensued.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n            On appeal, RSC and Srisang attack both of the reasons\n\nadvanced by CIS in support of its decision.        First, they maintain\n\nthat the restaurant manager position qualifies as a specialty\n\noccupation and that CIS, in failing to reach this conclusion, acted\n\narbitrarily.     Second, they posit that the marriage fraud bar does\n\nnot apply in cases involving nonimmigrant visas.           As a fallback,\n\n\n\n      2\n      This comedy of errors allowed Srisang to depart voluntarily\nfrom the United States on January 23, 2000 (thus mooting the\nremoval proceedings that had been brought in consequence of his\nsham marriage) and return three weeks later (pursuant to the\nspecialty occupation visa petition that CIS had approved in\nNovember of 1999).\n\n                                  -5-\n\fthey exhort us to find that the government forfeited any right to\n\ninvoke   either    rationale   by   approving   the   1999   visa   petition\n\nnotwithstanding full disclosure, at that time, of both the job\n\ndescription and the marriage fraud.\n\n             The government rejoins that we lack jurisdiction to\n\nentertain this appeal under the Immigration and Nationality Act\n\n(INA), as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, 8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).\n\nIts second line of defense is that both grounds of decision were\n\nwell-taken; that neither was waived; and that, therefore, the\n\ndistrict court's decision is bulletproof on the merits.\n\n             Given the sprawling nature of this asseverational array,\n\nwe begin at the beginning and address the jurisdictional question.\n\nWe then move to the merits.\n\n                    A.   The Jurisdictional Question.\n\n             Under 28 U.S.C. § 1291, we have jurisdiction over appeals\n\nfrom final decisions and orders of the district courts within this\n\ncircuit.     The case before us comprises an appeal from a decision of\n\none such district court — a decision that is final inasmuch as it\n\nends the litigation pending in that court, leaving nothing to be\n\ndone   but    to   execute   the    judgment.    Consequently,      we   have\n\njurisdiction over this appeal.          See Jilin Pharm. USA, Inc. v.\n\nChertoff, 447 F.3d 196, 199 n.4 (3d Cir. 2006); El-Khader v.\n\nMonica, 366 F.3d 562, 565-66 (7th Cir. 2004).\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\f          That is not the end of the jurisdictional issue.       The\n\nreal import of the government's jurisdictional exegesis relates to\n\nwhether the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction.       We\n\nmust consider that aspect of the argument despite the government's\n\nawkward phrasing of it.     After all, it normally is incumbent upon\n\nan appellate court to satisfy itself both of its own subject-matter\n\njurisdiction and of the subject-matter jurisdiction of the trial\n\ncourt before proceeding further.    See Bender v. Williamsport Area\n\nSch. Dist., 475 U.S. 534, 541 (1986); Irving v. United States, 162\n\nF.3d 154, 160 (1st Cir. 1998) (en banc).\n\n          In this instance, there may be reason to think that the\n\njurisdiction of the district court seems suspect.     The INA, in its\n\ncurrent   iteration,   is    littered   with   jurisdiction-stripping\n\nprovisions.   Of particular pertinence here, the law provides (with\n\nexceptions not relevant to this case) that:\n\n                 Notwithstanding any other provision of\n          law (statutory or nonstatutory) . . . and\n          regardless of whether the judgment, decision,\n          or action is made in removal proceedings, no\n          court shall have jurisdiction to review —\n\n                  . . . .\n\n                 (ii) any . . . decision or action of\n          the Attorney General or the Secretary of\n          Homeland Security the authority for which is\n          specified under [8 U.S.C. §§ 1151-1381] to be\n          in the discretion of the Attorney General or\n          the Secretary of Homeland Security, other than\n          the granting of relief under [certain asylum\n          provisions].\n\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\f8 U.S.C. § 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii).          The government suggests that, under\n\nthis provision, no court has jurisdiction to review CIS's denial of\n\nan   H-1B    visa   petition    because     such   a   determination    is   fully\n\ncommitted to agency discretion. See id. § 1184(a)(1) (stating that\n\n\"[t]he      admission   to     the   United    States    of    any   alien   as   a\n\nnonimmigrant shall be for such time and under such conditions as\n\nthe Attorney General may by regulations prescribe\").\n\n              The cogency of this argument is not self-evident.              Even\n\nthough the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of section 1252 apply\n\noutside the removal context, see Zhu v. Gonzales, 411 F.3d 292, 294\n\n(D.C. Cir. 2005); El-Khader, 366 F.3d at 567; CDI Info. Servs.,\n\nInc. v. Reno, 278 F.3d 616, 620 (6th Cir. 2002); Van Dinh v. Reno,\n\n197 F.3d 427, 432 (10th Cir. 1999), the question remains whether\n\nthe statutory scheme places the authority to grant H-1B visa\n\npetitions sufficiently within CIS's discretion as to engage the\n\ngears of the jurisdictional bar.\n\n              The   answer     to    this     question    is    freighted     with\n\nuncertainty, in part because the courts of appeals have disagreed\n\nabout how to approach the matter of when a statute can be said to\n\n\"specify\" discretionary authority. See, e.g., Zhu, 411 F.3d at 295\n\n(describing various approaches). To illustrate, the Sixth Circuit\n\ndetermined that it lacked jurisdiction to review the denial of an\n\nH-1B visa because the regulations, rather than the pertinent\n\nstatute itself, commit the matter to agency discretion.                  See CDI\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fInfo. Servs., 278 F.3d at 619.          But other circuits have rejected\n\nthat interpretive model.      See, e.g., Zafar v. U.S. Atty. Gen., 461\n\nF.3d 1357, 1361 (11th Cir. 2006); Zhao v. Gonzales, 404 F.3d 295,\n\n303 & n.6 (5th Cir. 2005).           We, too, recently have rejected it,\n\ninsisting that the relevant commitment to agency discretion must be\n\nfound in the statute itself.         See Alsamhouri v. Gonzales, ___ F.3d\n\n___, ___ (1st Cir. 2007) [No. 05-2800, slip op. at 9-10].               There\n\nis, moreover, a further problem.            The text of the statute upon\n\nwhich   the    government   relies    here,   8   U.S.C.   §   1184(a)(1),   is\n\nconsiderably less definitive in its commitment of authority to\n\nagency discretion than other statutes that have been found to\n\nanimate the jurisdictional bar.\n\n              In the face of these concerns, we believe that this is a\n\ncase in which we may — and should — bypass the jurisdictional\n\nquestion.      We recognize, of course, that federal courts cannot\n\nordinarily exercise hypothetical jurisdiction; that is, a federal\n\ncourt ordinarily may not assume the existence of jurisdiction in\n\norder to decide the merits of a case or controversy.                 Sinochem\n\nInt'l Co. v. Malay. Int'l Shipping Corp., 127 S. Ct. 1184, 1191\n\n(2007); Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Env't, 523 U.S. 83, 94\n\n(1998).   But that principle admits of an area of elasticity.\n\n              In mapping the contours of this narrow crevice, we have\n\ndistinguished between Article III jurisdiction (which may never be\n\nbypassed) and statutory jurisdiction (which may occasionally be\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fbypassed).       See, e.g., Universal Communic'n Sys., Inc. v. Lycos,\n\nInc., 478 F.3d 413, 426 & n.11 (1st Cir. 2007); Nisselson v.\n\nLernout, 469 F.3d 143, 150-51 (1st Cir. 2006); Parella v. Ret. Bd.\n\nof R.I. Employees' Ret. Sys., 173 F.3d 46, 54 (1st Cir. 1999); see\n\nalso McBee v. Delica Co., 417 F.3d 107, 127 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[W]e\n\nhave       consistently   interpreted   the   rule   [against   hypothetical\n\njurisdiction] as applying in its strict form only to issues going\n\nto Article III's requirements.\").          In the immigration context, we\n\nhave bypassed enigmatic jurisdictional questions in circumstances\n\nin which precedent clearly adumbrates the result on the merits.\n\nSee, e.g., Rivera-Martinez v. Ashcroft, 389 F.3d 207, 209 n.7 (1st\n\nCir. 2004); Seale v. INS, 323 F.3d 150, 152, 157 (1st Cir. 2003).3\n\n               This case fits within that crevice. On the one hand, the\n\njurisdictional question is not only thorny but also a matter of\n\nstatutory, not constitutional, dimension; and its proper resolution\n\nis uncertain.       On the other hand, the outcome on the merits is\n\nforeordained.      Consequently, we bypass the jurisdictional question\n\nand proceed directly to the heartland of the plaintiffs' appeal.\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      The language that we have used in immigration cases is not\nidentical to the language that we have used in non-immigration\nmatters. See Restoration Pres. Masonry, Inc. v. Grove Eur. Ltd.,\n325 F.3d 54, 59-60 (1st Cir. 2003) (describing the different\nformulations).   At bottom, however, the approaches are entirely\nconsistent with one another. See id. at 60.\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f                            B.   The Merits.\n\n           We are bound by the same ground rules as the district\n\ncourt in assessing agency decisions.           S. Shore Hosp., Inc. v.\n\nThompson, 308 F.3d 91, 97 (1st Cir. 2002).           Thus, the district\n\ncourt's decision in this case engenders de novo review.          See id.\n\n           Seeking a foothold, RSC and Srisang start by pointing out\n\nthat an agency's unexplained departure from a prior course of\n\naction may raise arbitrariness concerns.       See, e.g., Saint Fort v.\n\nAshcroft, 329 F.3d 191, 203-04 (1st Cir. 2003); Davila-Bardales v.\n\nINS, 27 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1994).         That doctrine, however, does\n\nnot shed any light here.     At this stage of the litigation, we are\n\nnot dealing with an unexplained departure: on remand from the\n\ndistrict court, the agency carefully laid out the reasoning that\n\nunderpinned its repudiation of the 1999 specialty occupation visa\n\nunder which Srisang had been allowed to enter the country.             CIS\n\nsaid that the earlier petition had been approved in error — and\n\naccordingly, the 2002 petition should be denied — because (i) the\n\nrestaurant manager position failed to qualify as a specialty\n\noccupation    and   (ii)   Srisang's     marriage   fraud   rendered   him\n\nstatutorily ineligible for the requested largesse.          Each of these\n\ngrounds floats on its own bottom; if either passes muster, the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment must be upheld.\n\n           Rising to this challenge, RSC and Srisang contest both\n\ngrounds.     They argue that CIS misconstrued the administrative\n\n\n                                  -11-\n\frecord,   misapplied     the   regulations    pertaining     to     specialty\n\noccupations, and incorrectly invoked the marriage fraud bar.               In\n\nour   view,    CIS's   determination   that   RSC's    restaurant    manager\n\nposition was not a specialty occupation is dispositive here.\n\n              We do not write on a pristine page.       Congress has laid\n\nout eligibility standards for the granting of H-1B specialty\n\noccupation visas.       See 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b).            Under\n\nthese standards, a specialty occupation requires: \"(A) theoretical\n\nand   practical    application   of    a   body   of   highly     specialized\n\nknowledge, and (B) attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in\n\nthe specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry\n\ninto the occupation in the United States.\"         Id. § 1184(i)(1).      The\n\nstatute also sets forth requirements pertaining to licensure (not\n\napplicable here) and providing for due recognition of experience\n\nand expertise. See id. § 1184(i)(2). Agency regulations flesh out\n\nthese requirements.       See 8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h).         The regulations\n\ndefine a specialty occupation as:\n\n              an occupation which requires theoretical and\n              practical application of a body of highly\n              specialized knowledge in fields of human\n              endeavor including, but not limited to,\n              architecture,    engineering,    mathematics,\n              physical sciences, social sciences, medicine\n              and health, education, business specialties,\n              accounting, law, theology, and the arts, and\n              which requires the attainment of a bachelor's\n              degree or higher in a specific specialty, or\n              its equivalent, as a minimum for entry into\n              the occupation in the United States.\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fId. § 214.2(h)(4)(ii). To satisfy this definition, a position must\n\ntouch at least one of four overlapping bases. See id. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A).\n\nThese bases are set out in the margin.4       The burden of proving that\n\na particular position comes within this taxonomy (and, thus,\n\nqualifies as a specialty occupation) is on the applicant.            See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1361.\n\n           Against this backdrop, we examine what transpired here.\n\nCIS, relying in part on the United States Department of Labor's\n\noccupational outlook handbook (the Handbook), determined that the\n\nplaintiffs failed to show that the restaurant manager position\n\ntouched any of the four specified bases.            In that regard, the\n\nagency found that the duties of the position were not more complex\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      The bases are:\n     (1) A baccalaureate or higher degree or its equivalent is\n     normally the minimum requirement for entry into the\n     particular position;\n\n     (2) The degree requirement is common to the industry in\n     parallel positions among similar organizations or, in the\n     alternative, an employer may show that its particular\n     position is so complex or unique that it can be performed\n     only by an individual with a degree;\n\n     (3) The employer normally requires a degree or its\n     equivalent for the position; or\n\n     (4) The nature of the specific duties are so specialized\n     and complex that knowledge required to perform the duties\n     is usually associated with the attainment of a\n     baccalaureate or higher degree.\n\n8 C.F.R. § 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A).\n\n                                   -13-\n\fthan those associated with similar (non-specialty) positions in the\n\ngeneral economy.\n\n              The plaintiffs attack CIS's analysis on several fronts.\n\nFirst, they take aim at the agency's use of the Handbook, which\n\nrecounts the particulars of numerous occupations.                  This array\n\nincludes \"food service managers,\" and CIS placed RSC's restaurant\n\nmanager position within that niche.           Doing so was an error, the\n\nplaintiffs claim, because that placement lumped RSC's establishment\n\nwith   less    toney    establishments    (such   as   fast-food    and   chain\n\nrestaurants).          Relatedly,   the   plaintiffs   argue   that   slavish\n\ndevotion to the Handbook led CIS to ignore evidence demonstrating\n\nRSC's uniquely complex and specialized needs.              We address these\n\narguments in the ensemble.\n\n              When Congress has entrusted an agency with rulemaking and\n\nadministrative authority, courts ordinarily afford considerable\n\ndeference to the agency's interpretation of the regulations that it\n\nhas promulgated under that authority.         See Bowles v. Seminole Rock\n\n& Sand Co., 325 U.S. 410, 414 (1945); S. Shore Hosp., 308 F.3d at\n\n97.    Courts should withhold this deference only if the agency's\n\ninterpretation is \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the\n\nregulation.\"     Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. 504, 512\n\n(1994) (quoting Seminole Rock, 325 U.S. at 414).                   We find no\n\nindication that CIS forfeited its entitlement to deference here.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -14-\n\f            In its review of petitions for nonimmigrant work visas,\n\nCIS   frequently    —   and   sensibly    —   consults   the   occupational\n\ndescriptions collected in the Handbook. Subject only to caveats at\n\nthe outer fringes, the choice of what reference materials to\n\nconsult is quintessentially within an agency's discretion — and,\n\nthus, courts routinely have approved CIS's practice of consulting\n\nthe Handbook.      See, e.g., Blacher v. Ridge, 436 F. Supp. 2d 602,\n\n609 (S.D.N.Y. 2006); Shanti, Inc. v. Reno, 36 F. Supp. 2d 1151,\n\n1165 (D. Minn. 1999); Hird/Blaker Corp. v. Sava, 712 F. Supp. 1095,\n\n1101 n.2 (S.D.N.Y. 1989); cf. Defensor v. Meissner, 201 F.3d 384,\n\n387 n.2 (5th Cir. 2000) (consulting the Handbook for a similar\n\npurpose).\n\n            Here, moreover, CIS's characterization of the restaurant\n\nmanager position as a species of the generic food service manager\n\nposition appears entirely reasonable. Based on the evidence before\n\nit, the agency fairly summarized the duties of RSC's restaurant\n\nmanager position as follows:\n\n            [The restaurant manager] would be in charge of\n            all operations, and he will perform duties\n            that entail, in part: hiring, firing, and\n            supervising employees; contacting suppliers\n            and   ordering    supplies;    promoting   the\n            restaurant; designing the layout of the\n            restaurant and its equipment; estimating food\n            and   beverage    costs    and   requisitions;\n            conferring with food preparation and other\n            personnel   to   plan    menus   and   related\n            activities; investigating and resolving food\n            quality and service complaints; and handling\n            all financial matters.\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fThese tasks appear a good match for the duties of a food service\n\nmanager, which the 2004-05 Handbook describes, in pertinent part,\n\nas follows:\n\n                   Food service managers are responsible\n           for the daily operations of restaurants and\n           other establishments that prepare and serve\n           meals and beverages to customers.      Besides\n           coordinating     activities   among    various\n           departments, such as kitchen, dining room, and\n           banquet operations, food service managers\n           ensure that customers are satisfied with their\n           dining experience. In addition, they oversee\n           the inventory and ordering of food, equipment,\n           and supplies and arrange for the routine\n           maintenance and upkeep of the restaurant, its\n           equipment, and facilities. Managers generally\n           are responsible for all of the administrative\n           and human-resource functions of running the\n           business, including recruiting new employees\n           and   monitoring   employee  performance   and\n           training.\n\n           The positions coincide in two other salient respects as\n\nwell.   First, RSC has singled out fluency in English and Thai as an\n\nimportant asset for its position. Correspondingly, the Handbook\n\nnotes that food service managers \"need to speak well, often in\n\nseveral languages, with a diverse clientele and staff.\"          Second,\n\nRSC projected an annual salary of $40,000 for the restaurant\n\nmanager position.    This is roughly comparable to the median annual\n\nearnings of a food service manager for a full-service restaurant in\n\n2002 as per the Handbook ($37,280).\n\n           The   plaintiffs'   attempt   to   pass   off   the   Handbook\n\nclassification as suitable only for fast-food and chain restaurants\n\nis unavailing.      A fair reading makes clear that the Handbook\n\n                                 -16-\n\fcontemplates that the food service manager heading is to cover both\n\nfull-service restaurants and less upscale operations.                 To cinch\n\nmatters, the plaintiffs identify no other Handbook classification\n\nthat is more apropos.        We conclude, therefore, that it was well\n\nwithin the realm of the agency's discretion to seek guidance from\n\nthe Handbook and, having done so, to refer to the food service\n\nmanager heading.\n\n            We    also   uphold   the     agency's   determination    that   the\n\nrestaurant manager position is not one that by its nature demands\n\na bachelor's degree or its equivalent in a specific specialty. The\n\nHandbook    makes    pellucid     that,    in   hiring   restaurant   managers,\n\nemployers seek candidates with a wide variety of backgrounds and\n\ncredentials, including graduates of hospitality management programs\n\n(some of which confer bachelor's degrees and some of which do not),\n\npersons trained in-house, and those with hands-on experience gained\n\nelsewhere.       There is nothing in the record that compels, or even\n\nstrongly supports, a conclusion that a bachelor's degree or its\n\nequivalent is a necessary credential for a restaurant manager.\n\n            In urging a contrary finding, the plaintiffs argue that\n\nthere is evidence in the record to the effect that a bachelor's\n\ndegree is the industry standard.               That argument is disingenuous.\n\nThe only \"evidence\" to which the plaintiffs point comprises, in its\n\nentirety,    a     one-paragraph     statement       furnished   by   a   single\n\nrestauranteur at RSC's request.            The statement asserts that every\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fapplicant for a managerial position at that particular eatery is\n\nexpected to have a degree in business administration.                    As CIS\n\nreasonably concluded, however, a bald assertion about the practices\n\nof a lone competitor, by itself, does not suffice to prove an\n\nindustry-wide standard.\n\n            The plaintiffs have another shot in their sling.                  They\n\ncontend that, even if a bachelor's degree is not generally required\n\nfor restaurant managers, RSC is in need of a restaurant manager\n\nwith   a   degree   in    business   administration       and    related      work\n\nexperience.    That argument does not withstand scrutiny.\n\n            The courts and the agency consistently have stated that,\n\nalthough a general-purpose bachelor's degree, such as a business\n\nadministration degree, may be a legitimate prerequisite for a\n\nparticular position, requiring such a degree, without more, will\n\nnot justify the granting of a petition for an H-1B specialty\n\noccupation visa.     See, e.g., Tapis Int'l v. INS, 94 F. Supp. 2d\n\n172, 175-76 (D. Mass. 2000); Shanti, 36 F. Supp. 2d at 1164-66; cf.\n\nMatter of Michael Hertz Assocs., 19 I&N Dec. 558, 560 (BIA 1988)\n\n(providing     frequently    cited   analysis      in    connection     with     a\n\nconceptually    similar     provision).     This    is   as     it   should    be:\n\nelsewise, an employer could ensure the granting of a specialty\n\noccupation visa petition by the simple expedient of creating a\n\ngeneric (and essentially artificial) degree requirement.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f           We hasten to emphasize that a degree requirement in a\n\nspecific specialty — one that relates directly to the duties and\n\nresponsibilities of a particular position — is given more weight by\n\nthe agency than a requirement for a generic degree.            See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 214.2(h)(4)(ii).    This gloss is mandated by the language of the\n\nstatute   itself.     See    8   U.S.C.    §   1184(i)(1).      Given       this\n\ndistinction,   we   cannot   fault   CIS's     determination    that    RSC's\n\nrequirement for a free-floating degree in business administration\n\nwas   insufficient,   without    some     compelling   connection      to    the\n\nresponsibilities of the restaurant manager position, to require a\n\nfinding of a specialty occupation here.5\n\n           The rejection of these legal arguments brings us to the\n\nquestion of whether the agency, on the record as a whole, made a\n\nreasonable decision.    The record reveals that CIS considered all\n\nthe relevant facts and produced a closely reasoned judgment as to\n\nthe nature of the work involved in the restaurant manager position.\n\nIn the absence of an error of law — and we see none here — this\n\ncase comes down to straight abuse-of-discretion review. Under that\n\nstandard, the outcome is foreordained.         While the APA authorizes a\n\nreviewing court to set aside an agency's \"action, findings, [or]\n\n\n      5\n      The plaintiffs make a veiled suggestion that the combined\nrequirements of a bachelor's degree in business administration plus\nwork experience transform its degree requirement into the\n\"equivalent\" of a specialized degree.     Assuming, for argument's\nsake, that this suggestion has been sufficiently developed, we\nthink that the facts here afforded CIS ample discretion to reject\nit.\n\n                                   -19-\n\fconclusions\" if they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of\n\ndiscretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\" 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A), an\n\nagency's decision does not trigger that provision as long as it\n\ncorrectly explicates the governing law and turns on a plausible\n\nrendition of the facts in the record.6        See Granite State Concrete\n\nCo. v. Surface Transp. Bd., 417 F.3d 85, 92 (1st Cir. 2005).               In\n\ndetermining that the position in question did not warrant the\n\ngranting of a petition for a specialty occupation visa, CIS has not\n\noperated outside the wide margins of this discretion.\n\n            Of course, the plaintiffs also ask us to factor into the\n\nmix CIS's earlier granting of the 1999 specialty occupation visa\n\npetition.     We   have   taken   that   circumstance    into   account   and\n\nconclude that it does not compel a reversal here.\n\n            The mere fact that the agency, by mistake or oversight,\n\napproved a specialty occupation visa petition on one occasion does\n\nnot create an automatic entitlement to the approval of a subsequent\n\npetition for renewal of that visa.           See, e.g., Savoury v. U.S.\n\nAtty. Gen., 449 F.3d 1307, 1317-18 (11th Cir. 2006); Sussex Eng'g,\n\nLtd. v. Montgomery, 825 F.2d 1084, 1090 (6th Cir. 1987); see also\n\n8 C.F.R. § 214.1(a)(3)(i) (requiring nonimmigrant aliens applying\n\n\n\n\n      6\n      This is a highly deferential standard of review — and where,\nas here, an agency is called upon both to interpret regulations\nthat it has promulgated and to find the facts, deference is doubly\ndesirable.\n\n                                    -20-\n\ffor extensions of stay to establish either that they are admissible\n\nor that inadmissibility has been waived).\n\n            Along the same lines, this prior history does not justify\n\nthe plaintiffs' claim of estoppel.           We have reiterated, with a\n\nregularity bordering on the echolalic, that estoppel rarely will be\n\ninvoked against the federal government. See, e.g., Frillz, Inc. v.\n\nLader, 104 F.3d 515, 518 (1st Cir. 1997); United States v. Ven-\n\nFuel, Inc., 758 F.2d 741, 761 (1st Cir. 1985).            That principle\n\nholds fast in immigration cases.       See, e.g., Costa v. INS, 233 F.3d\n\n31, 38 (1st Cir. 2000) (requiring, among other things, a showing of\n\n\"affirmative government misconduct\"); see also Andrade v. Gonzales,\n\n459 F.3d 538, 545 n.2 (5th Cir. 2006); Savoury, 449 F.3d at 1318-\n\n19.    In the absence of affirmative government misconduct — and we\n\ndescry none here — there is no room for invocation of the estoppel\n\ndoctrine.\n\nIII.    CONCLUSION\n\n            We   end   with   a   succinct   summary.   For   the   reasons\n\nelucidated above, we bypass the jurisdictional question.            On the\n\nmerits, the ultimate decision about whether to grant a petition for\n\na specialty occupation visa lies within the discretion of the\n\nagency.     See 8 U.S.C. § 1184(a)(1).         Because CIS's exercise of\n\ndiscretion here is untainted by either legal or factual error, we\n\ndiscern no basis for disturbing its denial of RSC's petition.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\fFinally, we reject out of hand the plaintiffs' entreaty that\n\nestoppel should carry the day.\n\n            We   need   go   no   further.7   We   hold,   without   serious\n\nquestion, that the district court did not err in granting summary\n\njudgment for the defendants.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     7\n       The conclusions we have reached render it unnecessary for us\nto consider whether the agency, in arriving at its decision,\ncorrectly applied the marriage fraud bar contained in 8 U.S.C. § 1154(c) to\nthis petition for a nonimmigrant work visa. By like token, we have\nno need to address either the soundness or the applicability of the\ngovernment's suggestion that the APA itself (specifically, 5 U.S.C.\n§ 701(a)(2)) may foreclose judicial review of a nonimmigrant\nvisitor's request for an extension of stay.\n\n                                     -22-\n\f",

Those hopes were never realized. After some procedural backing and filling, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants (all government agencies or actors). <i>See Royal Siam Corp. v.

On a petition filed by RSC's predecessor in interest in 1999, Srisang &#8212; a Thai national who purportedly possessed the equivalent of a bachelor's degree in business administration &#8212; received a specialty occupation visa (colloquially known as an H-1B visa). This nonimmigrant visa allowed him to enter the United States for a three-year period in order to work as a restaurant manager.

During the course of its review, CIS advised RSC of its doubts about the petition. On October 24, 2002, the agency issued a request for additional proof, noting that the \"evidence submitted is not sufficient to establish that the job is specialty in scope.\" Although RSC made a supplemental submission, CIS eventually denied the petition. On administrative review, CIS's appeals office upheld the denial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RSC and Srisang thereupon commenced this action, posturing it as a request for review of a final agency decision under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 701-706. In their complaint, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The district court stayed removal proceedings against Srisang. In due course, the court, while retaining jurisdiction, remanded the case to CIS for a fuller explanation of its decision. The district court found the cryptic quality of the original decision especially troubling in light of the agency's 1999 approval of an H-1B visa petition for what the court deemed to be an \"equivalent position.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, CIS reaffirmed its previous denial of the 2002 petition. In explaining its decision, CIS observed that it now regarded its grant of the 1999 petition (which rested on similar data) as plainly erroneous because the job, as described by RSC's predecessor in interest, did not qualify as a specialty occupation. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), 1184(i); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A). A job does not qualify as a specialty occupation unless it satisfies an amalgam of criteria that relate to educational requirements, complexity of the work, the specialized nature of the duties to be performed, and the like. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A). In this case, the agency concluded that the proof submitted did not establish that the restaurant manager position &#8212; either in 1999 or in 2002 &#8212; constituted a specialty occupation within the purview of these criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CIS's explanation did not stop there. The agency noted that its approval of the earlier petition had been erroneous for another reason as well. In 1998, CIS had found Srisang's marriage to a United States citizen fraudulent, that is, entered into for the purpose of circumventing the immigration laws. Citing 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1154(c), CIS expressed the view that because Srisang had engaged in marriage fraud, he was \"statutorily ineligible\" for a specialty occupation visa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances attendant to this alternate ground of decision are not in dispute. The marriage occurred in 1995. As a result, Srisang was conditionally granted lawful permanent resident status. In 1997, Srisang sought to make that status unconditional. Following an investigation, however, CIS found the marriage fraudulent (a finding that Srisang does not now contest). Withal, the government's left hand obviously did not appreciate what the right hand was doing. Although the marriage fraud finding was brought to CIS's attention in connection with the 1999 specialty occupation visa petition, the agency had, in an apparent oversight, approved that petition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With CIS's detailed amplification of the binary grounds for rejection of the 2002 visa petition in hand, the district court ruled that the denial was neither arbitrary nor capricious. <i>See Royal Siam,</i> 424 F.Supp.2d at 343. Accordingly, the court entered summary judgment in the defendants' favor. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, RSC and Srisang attack both of the reasons advanced by CIS in support of its decision. First, they maintain that the restaurant manager position qualifies as a specialty occupation and that CIS, in failing to reach this conclusion, acted arbitrarily. Second, they posit that the marriage fraud bar does not apply in cases involving nonimmigrant visas. As a fallback, they exhort us to find that the government forfeited any right to invoke either rationale by approving the 1999 visa petition notwithstanding full disclosure, at that time, of both the job description and the marriage fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government rejoins that we lack jurisdiction to entertain this appeal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). Its second line of defense is that both grounds of decision were well-taken; that neither was waived; and that, therefore, the district court's decision is bulletproof on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the sprawling nature of this asseverational array, we begin at the beginning and address the jurisdictional question. We then move to the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Jurisdictional Question.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291, we have jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions and orders of the district courts within this circuit. The case before us comprises an appeal from a decision of one such district court &#8212; a decision that is final inasmuch as it ends the litigation pending in that court, leaving nothing to be done but to execute the judgment. Consequently, we have jurisdiction over this appeal. <i>See Jilin Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Chertoff,</i> 447 F.3d 196, 199 n. 4 (3d Cir.2006); <i>El-Khader v. Monica,</i> 366 F.3d 562, 565-66 (7th Cir. 2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is not the end of the jurisdictional issue. The real import of the government's jurisdictional exegesis relates to whether the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction. We must consider that aspect of the argument despite the government's awkward phrasing of it. After all, it normally is incumbent upon an appellate court to satisfy itself both of its own subject-matter jurisdiction and of the subject-matter jurisdiction of the trial court before proceeding further. <i>See Bender v. Williamsport Area Sch. Dist.,</i> 475 U.S. 534, 541, 106 S.Ct. 1326, 89 L.Ed.2d 501 (1986); <i>Irving v. United States,</i> 162 F.3d 154, 160 (1st Cir.1998) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, there may be reason to think that the jurisdiction of the district court seems suspect. The INA, in its current iteration, is littered with jurisdiction-stripping provisions. Of particular pertinence here, the law provides (with exceptions not relevant to this case) that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding any other provision of law (statutory or nonstatutory) . . . and regardless of whether the judgment, decision, or action is made in removal proceedings, no court shall have jurisdiction to review &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) any . . . decision or action of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security the authority for which is specified under [8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1151-1381] to be in the discretion of the Attorney General or the Secretary of Homeland Security, other than the granting of relief under [certain asylum provisions].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). The government suggests that, under this provision, no court has jurisdiction to review CIS's denial of an H-1B visa petition because such a determination is fully committed to agency discretion. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1184(a)(1) (stating that \"[t]he admission to the United States of any alien as a nonimmigrant shall be for such time and under such conditions as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cogency of this argument is not self-evident. Even though the jurisdiction-stripping provisions of section 1252 apply outside the removal context, <i>see Zhu v. Gonzales,</i> 411 F.3d 292, 294 (D.C.Cir.2005); <i>El-Khader,</i> 366 F.3d at 567; <i>CDI Info. Servs., Inc. v. Reno,</i> 278 F.3d 616, 620 (6th Cir.2002); <i>Van Dinh v. Reno,</i> 197 F.3d 427, 432 (10th Cir.1999), the question remains whether the statutory scheme places the authority to grant H-1B visa petitions sufficiently within CIS's discretion as to engage the gears of the jurisdictional bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The answer to this question is freighted with uncertainty, in part because the courts of appeals have disagreed about how to approach the matter of when a statute can be said to \"specify\" discretionary authority. <i>See, e.g., Zhu,</i> 411 F.3d at 295 (describing various approaches). To illustrate, the Sixth Circuit determined that it lacked jurisdiction to review the denial of an H-1B visa because the regulations, rather than the pertinent statute itself, commit the matter to agency discretion. <i>See CDI Info. Servs.,</i> 278 F.3d at 619. But other circuits have rejected that interpretive model. <i>See, e.g., Zafar v. U.S. Atty. Gen.,</i> 461 F.3d 1357, 1361 (11th Cir. 2006); <i>Zhao v. Gonzales,</i> 404 F.3d 295, 303 &amp; n. 6 (5th Cir.2005). We, too, recently have rejected it, insisting that the relevant commitment to agency discretion must be found in the statute itself. <i>See Alsamhouri v. Gonzales,</i> 484 F.3d 117, ___, ___-___, 2007 WL 1153033 (1st Cir. 2007) [No. 05-2800, slip op. at 9-10]. There is, moreover, a further problem. The text of the statute upon which the government relies here, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1184(a)(1), is considerably less definitive in its commitment of authority to agency discretion than other statutes that have been found to animate the jurisdictional bar.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the face of these concerns, we believe that this is a case in which we may &#8212; and should &#8212; bypass the jurisdictional question. We recognize, of course, that federal courts cannot ordinarily exercise hypothetical jurisdiction; that is, a federal court ordinarily may not assume the existence of jurisdiction in order to decide the merits of a case or controversy. <i>Sinochem Int'l Co. v. Malay. Int'l Shipping Corp.,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 127 S.Ct. 1184, 1191, 167 L.Ed.2d 15 (2007); <i>Steel Co. v. Citizens for Better Env't,</i> 523 U.S. 83, 94, 118 S.Ct. 1003, 140 L.Ed.2d 210 (1998). But that principle admits of an area of elasticity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mapping the contours of this narrow crevice, we have distinguished between Article III jurisdiction (which may never be bypassed) and statutory jurisdiction (which may occasionally be bypassed). <i>See, e.g., Universal Communic'n Sys., Inc. v. Lycos, Inc.,</i> 478 F.3d 413, 426 &amp; n. 11 (1st Cir. 2007); <i>Nisselson v. Lernout,</i> 469 F.3d 143, 150-51 (1st Cir.2006); <i>Parella v. Ret. Bd. of R.I. Employees' Ret. Sys.,</i> 173 F.3d 46, 54 (1st Cir.1999); <i>see also McBee v. Delica Co.,</i> 417 F.3d 107, 127 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[W]e have consistently interpreted the rule [against hypothetical jurisdiction] as applying in its strict form only to issues going to Article III's requirements.\"). In the immigration context, we have bypassed enigmatic jurisdictional questions in circumstances in which precedent clearly adumbrates the result on the merits. <i>See, e.g., Rivera-Martinez v. Ashcroft,</i> 389 F.3d 207, 209 n. 7 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Seale v. INS,</i> 323 F.3d 150, 152, 157 (1st Cir.2003).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case fits within that crevice. On the one hand, the jurisdictional question is not only thorny but also a matter of statutory, not constitutional, dimension; and its proper resolution is uncertain. On the other hand, the outcome on the merits is foreordained. Consequently, we bypass the jurisdictional question and proceed directly to the heartland of the plaintiffs' appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Merits.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are bound by the same ground rules as the district court in assessing agency decisions. <i>S. Shore Hosp., Inc. v. Thompson,</i> 308 F.3d 91, 97 (1st Cir.2002). Thus, the district court's decision in this case engenders de novo review. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Seeking a foothold, RSC and Srisang start by pointing out that an agency's unexplained departure from a prior course of action may raise arbitrariness concerns. <i>See, e.g., Saint Fort v. Ashcroft,</i> 329 F.3d 191, 203-04 (1st Cir.2003); <i>Davila-Bardales v. INS,</i> 27 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1994). That doctrine, however, does not shed any light here. At this stage of the litigation, we are not dealing with an <i>unexplained</i> departure: on remand from the district court, the agency carefully laid out the reasoning that underpinned its repudiation of the 1999 specialty occupation visa under which Srisang had been allowed to enter the country. CIS said that the earlier petition had been approved in error &#8212; and accordingly, the 2002 petition should be denied &#8212; because (i) the restaurant manager position failed to qualify as a specialty occupation and (ii) Srisang's marriage fraud rendered him statutorily ineligible for the requested largesse. Each of these grounds floats on its own bottom; if either passes muster, the district court's grant of summary judgment must be upheld.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rising to this challenge, RSC and Srisang contest both grounds. They argue that CIS misconstrued the administrative record, misapplied the regulations pertaining to specialty occupations, and incorrectly invoked the marriage fraud bar. In our view, CIS's determination that RSC's restaurant manager position was not a specialty occupation is dispositive here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not write on a pristine page. Congress has laid out eligibility standards for the granting of H-1B specialty occupation visas. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). Under these standards, a specialty occupation requires: \"(A) theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge, and (B) attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1184(i)(1). The statute also sets forth requirements pertaining to licensure (not applicable here) and providing for due recognition of experience and expertise. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1184(i)(2). Agency regulations flesh out these requirements. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 214.2(h). The regulations define a specialty occupation as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">an occupation which requires theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge in fields of human endeavor including, but not limited to, architecture, engineering, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences, medicine and health, education, business specialties, accounting, law, theology, and the arts, and which requires the attainment of a bachelor's degree or higher in a specific specialty, or its equivalent, as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 214.2(h)(4)(ii). To satisfy this definition, a position must touch at least one of four overlapping bases. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A). These bases are set out in the margin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The burden of proving that a particular position comes within this taxonomy (and, thus, qualifies as a specialty occupation) is on the applicant. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1361.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we examine what transpired here. CIS, relying in part on the United States Department of Labor's occupational outlook handbook (the Handbook), determined that the plaintiffs failed to show that the restaurant manager position touched any of the four specified bases. In that regard, the agency found that the duties of the position were not more complex than those associated with similar (non-specialty) positions in the general economy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs attack CIS's analysis on several fronts. First, they take aim at the agency's use of the Handbook, which recounts the particulars of numerous occupations. This array includes \"food service managers,\" and CIS placed RSC's restaurant manager position within that niche. Doing so was an error, the plaintiffs claim, because that placement lumped RSC's establishment with less toney establishments (such as fast-food and chain restaurants). Relatedly, the plaintiffs argue that slavish devotion to the Handbook led CIS to ignore evidence demonstrating RSC's uniquely complex and specialized needs. We address these arguments in the ensemble.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Congress has entrusted an agency with rulemaking and administrative authority, courts ordinarily afford considerable deference to the agency's interpretation of the regulations that it has promulgated under that authority. <i>See Bowles v. Seminole Rock &amp; Sand Co.,</i> 325 U.S. 410, 414, 65 S.Ct. 1215, 89 L.Ed. 1700 (1945); <i>S. Shore Hosp.,</i> 308 F.3d at 97. Courts should withhold this deference only if the agency's interpretation is \"plainly erroneous or inconsistent with the regulation.\" <i>Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala,</i> 512 U.S. 504, 512, 114 S.Ct. 2381, 129 L.Ed.2d 405 (1994) (quoting <i>Seminole Rock,</i> 325 U.S. at 414, 65 S.Ct. 1215). We find no indication that CIS forfeited its entitlement to deference here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In its review of petitions for nonimmigrant work visas, CIS frequently &#8212; and sensibly &#8212; consults the occupational descriptions collected in the Handbook. Subject only to caveats at the outer fringes, the choice of what reference materials to consult is quintessentially within an agency's discretion &#8212; and, thus, courts routinely have approved CIS's practice of consulting the Handbook. <i>See, e.g., Blacher v. Ridge,</i> 436 F.Supp.2d 602, 609 (S.D.N.Y. 2006); <i>Shanti, Inc. v. Reno,</i> 36 F.Supp.2d 1151, 1165 (D.Minn.1999); <i>Hird/Blaker Corp. v. Sava,</i> 712 F.Supp. 1095, 1101 n. 2 (S.D.N.Y.1989); <i>cf. Defensor v. Meissner,</i> 201 F.3d 384, 387 n. 2 (5th Cir.2000) (consulting the Handbook for a similar purpose).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, moreover, CIS's characterization of the restaurant manager position as a species of the generic food service manager position appears entirely reasonable. Based on the evidence before it, the agency fairly summarized the duties of RSC's restaurant manager position as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[The restaurant manager] would be in charge of all operations, and he will perform duties that entail, in part: hiring, firing, and supervising employees; contacting suppliers and ordering supplies; promoting the restaurant; designing the layout of the restaurant and its equipment; estimating food and beverage costs and requisitions; conferring with food preparation and other personnel to plan menus and related activities; investigating and resolving food quality and service complaints; and handling all financial matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These tasks appear a good match for the duties of a food service manager, which the 2004-05 Handbook describes, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Food service managers are responsible for the daily operations of restaurants and other establishments that prepare and serve meals and beverages to customers. Besides coordinating activities among various departments, such as kitchen, dining room, and banquet operations, food service managers ensure that customers are satisfied with their dining experience. In addition, they oversee the inventory and ordering of food, equipment, and supplies and arrange for the routine maintenance and upkeep of the restaurant, its equipment, and facilities. Managers generally are responsible for all of the administrative and human-resource functions of running the business, including recruiting new employees and monitoring employee performance and training.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The positions coincide in two other salient respects as well. First, RSC has singled out fluency in English and Thai as an important asset for its position. Correspondingly, the Handbook notes that food service managers \"need to speak well, often in several languages, with a diverse clientele and staff.\" Second, RSC projected an annual salary of $40,000 for the restaurant manager position. This is roughly comparable to the median annual earnings of a food service manager for a full-service restaurant in 2002 as per the Handbook ($37,280).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' attempt to pass off the Handbook classification as suitable only for fast-food and chain restaurants is unavailing. A fair reading makes clear that the Handbook contemplates that the food service manager heading is to cover both full-service restaurants and less upscale operations. To cinch matters, the plaintiffs identify no other Handbook classification that is more apropos. We conclude, therefore, that it was well within the realm of the agency's discretion to seek guidance from the Handbook and, having done so, to refer to the food service manager heading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also uphold the agency's determination that the restaurant manager position is not one that by its nature demands a bachelor's degree or its equivalent in a specific specialty. The Handbook makes pellucid that, in hiring restaurant managers, employers seek candidates with a wide variety of backgrounds and credentials, including graduates of hospitality management programs (some of which confer bachelor's degrees and some of which do not), persons trained in-house, and those with hands-on experience gained elsewhere. There is nothing in the record that compels, or even strongly supports, a conclusion that a bachelor's degree or its equivalent is a necessary credential for a restaurant manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In urging a contrary finding, the plaintiffs argue that there is evidence in the record to the effect that a bachelor's degree is the industry standard. That argument is disingenuous. The only \"evidence\" to which the plaintiffs point comprises, in its entirety, a one-paragraph statement furnished by a single restauranteur at RSC's request. The statement asserts that every applicant for a managerial position <i>at that particular eatery</i> is expected to have a degree in business administration. As CIS reasonably concluded, however, a bald assertion about the practices of a lone competitor, by itself, does not suffice to prove an industry-wide standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have another shot in their sling. They contend that, even if a bachelor's degree is not generally required for restaurant managers, RSC is in need of a restaurant manager with a degree in business administration and related work experience. That argument does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The courts and the agency consistently have stated that, although a general-purpose bachelor's degree, such as a business administration degree, may be a legitimate prerequisite for a particular position, requiring such a degree, without more, will not justify the granting of a petition for an H-1B specialty occupation visa. <i>See, e.g., Tapis Int'l v. INS,</i> 94 F.Supp.2d 172, 175-76 (D.Mass.2000); <i>Shanti,</i> 36 F.Supp.2d at 1164-66; <i>cf. Matter of Michael Hertz Assocs.,</i> 19 I &amp; N Dec. 558, 560 (BIA 1988) (providing frequently cited analysis in connection with a conceptually similar provision). This is as it should be: elsewise, an employer could ensure the granting of a specialty occupation visa petition by the simple expedient of creating a generic (and essentially artificial) degree requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to emphasize that a degree requirement in a specific specialty &#8212; one that relates directly to the duties and responsibilities of a particular position &#8212; is given more weight by the agency than a requirement for a generic degree. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 214.2(h)(4)(ii). This gloss is mandated by the language of the statute itself. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1184(i)(1). Given this distinction, we cannot fault CIS's determination that RSC's requirement for a free-floating degree in business administration was insufficient, without some compelling connection to the responsibilities of the restaurant manager position, to require a finding of a specialty occupation here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rejection of these legal arguments brings us to the question of whether the agency, on the record as a whole, made a reasonable decision. The record reveals that CIS considered all the relevant facts and produced a closely reasoned judgment as to the nature of the work involved in the restaurant manager position. In the absence of an error of law &#8212; and we see none here &#8212; this case comes down to straight abuse-of-discretion review. Under that standard, the outcome is foreordained. While the APA authorizes a reviewing court to set aside an agency's \"action, findings, [or] conclusions\" if they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A), an agency's decision does not trigger that provision as long as it correctly explicates the governing law and turns on a plausible rendition of the facts in the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Granite State Concrete Co. v. Surface Transp. Bd.,</i> 417 F.3d 85, 92 (1st Cir.2005). In determining that the position in question did not warrant the granting of a petition for a specialty occupation visa, CIS has not operated outside the wide margins of this discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the plaintiffs also ask us to factor into the mix CIS's earlier granting of the 1999 specialty occupation visa petition. We have taken that circumstance into account and conclude that it does not compel a reversal here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The mere fact that the agency, by mistake or oversight, approved a specialty occupation visa petition on one occasion does not create an automatic entitlement to the approval of a subsequent petition for renewal of that visa. <i>See, e.g., Savoury v. U.S. Atty. Gen.,</i> 449 F.3d 1307, 1317-18 (11th Cir.2006); <i>Sussex Eng'g, Ltd. v. Montgomery,</i> 825 F.2d 1084, 1090 (6th Cir. 1987); <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 214.1(a)(3)(i) (requiring nonimmigrant aliens applying for extensions of stay to establish either that they are admissible or that inadmissibility has been waived).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Along the same lines, this prior history does not justify the plaintiffs' claim of estoppel. We have reiterated, with a regularity bordering on the echolalic, that estoppel rarely will be invoked against the federal government. <i>See, e.g., Frillz, Inc. v. Lader,</i> 104 F.3d 515, 518 (1st Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Ven-Fuel, Inc.,</i> 758 F.2d 741, 761 (1st Cir.1985). That principle holds fast in immigration cases. <i>See, e.g., Costa v. INS,</i> 233 F.3d 31, 38 (1st Cir. 2000) (requiring, among other things, a showing of \"affirmative government misconduct\"); <i>see also Andrade v. Gonzales,</i> 459 F.3d 538, 545 n. 2 (5th Cir.2006); <i>Savoury,</i> 449 F.3d at 1318-19. In the absence of affirmative government misconduct &#8212; and we descry none here &#8212; there is no room for invocation of the estoppel doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We end with a succinct summary. For the reasons elucidated above, we bypass the jurisdictional question. On the merits, the ultimate decision about whether to grant a petition for a specialty occupation visa lies within the discretion of the agency. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1184(a)(1). Because CIS's exercise of discretion here is untainted by either legal or factual error, we discern no basis for disturbing its denial of RSC's petition.

Those hopes were never realized. After some procedural backing and filling, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants (all government agencies or actors). <i>See Royal Siam Corp. v.

BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We assume the reader's familiarity with the district court's opinion and, thus, content ourselves with a sketch of the pertinent facts and travel of the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RSC owns and operates an upscale Thai restaurant in Carolina, Puerto Rico. On a petition filed by RSC's predecessor in interest in 1999, Srisang &#8212; a Thai national who purportedly possessed the equivalent of a bachelor's degree in business administration &#8212; received a specialty occupation visa (colloquially known as an H-1B visa). This nonimmigrant visa allowed him to enter the United States for a three-year period in order to work as a restaurant manager. Srisang availed himself of the opportunity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2002, with Srisang's visa due to expire, RSC sought its renewal. During the course of its review, CIS advised RSC of its doubts about the petition. On October 24, 2002, the agency issued a request for additional proof, noting that the \"evidence submitted is not sufficient to establish that the job is specialty in scope.\" Although RSC made a supplemental submission, CIS eventually denied the petition. On administrative review, CIS's appeals office upheld the denial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">RSC and Srisang thereupon commenced this action, posturing it as a request for review of a final agency decision under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), 5 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 701-706. In their complaint, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief. The district court stayed removal proceedings against Srisang. In due course, the court, while retaining jurisdiction, remanded the case to CIS for a fuller explanation of its decision. The district court found the cryptic quality of the original decision especially troubling in light of the agency's 1999 approval of an H-1B visa petition for what the court deemed to be an \"equivalent position.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, CIS reaffirmed its previous denial of the 2002 petition. In explaining its decision, CIS observed that it now regarded its grant of the 1999 petition (which rested on similar data) as plainly erroneous because the job, as described by RSC's predecessor in interest, did not qualify as a specialty occupation. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b), 1184(i); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A). A job does not qualify as a specialty occupation unless it satisfies an amalgam of criteria that relate to educational requirements, complexity of the work, the specialized nature of the duties to be performed, and the like. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A). In this case, the agency concluded that the proof submitted did not establish that the restaurant manager position &#8212; either in 1999 or in 2002 &#8212; constituted a specialty occupation within the purview of these criteria.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">CIS's explanation did not stop there. The agency noted that its approval of the earlier petition had been erroneous for another reason as well. In 1998, CIS had found Srisang's marriage to a United States citizen fraudulent, that is, entered into for the purpose of circumventing the immigration laws. Citing 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1154(c), CIS expressed the view that because Srisang had engaged in marriage fraud, he was \"statutorily ineligible\" for a specialty occupation visa.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The circumstances attendant to this alternate ground of decision are not in dispute. The marriage occurred in 1995. As a result, Srisang was conditionally granted lawful permanent resident status. In 1997, Srisang sought to make that status unconditional. Following an investigation, however, CIS found the marriage fraudulent (a finding that Srisang does not now contest). Withal, the government's left hand obviously did not appreciate what the right hand was doing. Although the marriage fraud finding was brought to CIS's attention in connection with the 1999 specialty occupation visa petition, the agency had, in an apparent oversight, approved that petition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With CIS's detailed amplification of the binary grounds for rejection of the 2002 visa petition in hand, the district court ruled that the denial was neither arbitrary nor capricious. <i>See Royal Siam,</i> 424 F.Supp.2d at 343. Accordingly, the court entered summary judgment in the defendants' favor. This timely appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, RSC and Srisang attack both of the reasons advanced by CIS in support of its decision. First, they maintain that the restaurant manager position qualifies as a specialty occupation and that CIS, in failing to reach this conclusion, acted arbitrarily. Second, they posit that the marriage fraud bar does not apply in cases involving nonimmigrant visas. As a fallback, they exhort us to find that the government forfeited any right to invoke either rationale by approving the 1999 visa petition notwithstanding full disclosure, at that time, of both the job description and the marriage fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government rejoins that we lack jurisdiction to entertain this appeal under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(a)(2)(B)(ii). Its second line of defense is that both grounds of decision were well-taken; that neither was waived; and that, therefore, the district court's decision is bulletproof on the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given the sprawling nature of this asseverational array, we begin at the beginning and address the jurisdictional question. We then move to the merits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Jurisdictional Question.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291, we have jurisdiction over appeals from final decisions and orders of the district courts within this circuit. The case before us comprises an appeal from a decision of one such district court &#8212; a decision that is final inasmuch as it ends the litigation pending in that court, leaving nothing to be done but to execute the judgment. Consequently, we have jurisdiction over this appeal. <i>See Jilin Pharm. USA, Inc. v. Chertoff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"794248\"><a href=\"/opinion/794248/no-05-2788/\"><span class=\"volume\">447</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">196</span></a></span>, 199 n. 4 (3d Cir.2006); <i>El-Khader v.

The real import of the government's jurisdictional exegesis relates to whether the district court had subject-matter jurisdiction. We must consider that aspect of the argument despite the government's awkward phrasing of it. After all, it normally is incumbent upon an appellate court to satisfy itself both of its own subject-matter jurisdiction and of the subject-matter jurisdiction of the trial court before proceeding further. <i>See Bender v.

The government suggests that, under this provision, no court has jurisdiction to review CIS's denial of an H-1B visa petition because such a determination is fully committed to agency discretion. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1184(a)(1) (stating that \"[t]he admission to the United States of any alien as a nonimmigrant shall be for such time and under such conditions as the Attorney General may by regulations prescribe\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The cogency of this argument is not self-evident.

To illustrate, the Sixth Circuit determined that it lacked jurisdiction to review the denial of an H-1B visa because the regulations, rather than the pertinent statute itself, commit the matter to agency discretion. <i>See CDI Info. Servs.,</i> 278 F.3d at 619. But other circuits have rejected that interpretive model. <i>See, e.g., Zafar v. U.S. Atty.

There is, moreover, a further problem.

That doctrine, however, does not shed any light here. At this stage of the litigation, we are not dealing with an <i>unexplained</i> departure: on remand from the district court, the agency carefully laid out the reasoning that underpinned its repudiation of the 1999 specialty occupation visa under which Srisang had been allowed to enter the country. CIS said that the earlier petition had been approved in error &#8212; and accordingly, the 2002 petition should be denied &#8212; because (i) the restaurant manager position failed to qualify as a specialty occupation and (ii) Srisang's marriage fraud rendered him statutorily ineligible for the requested largesse. Each of these grounds floats on its own bottom; if either passes muster, the district court's grant of summary judgment must be upheld.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rising to this challenge, RSC and Srisang contest both grounds. They argue that CIS misconstrued the administrative record, misapplied the regulations pertaining to specialty occupations, and incorrectly invoked the marriage fraud bar. In our view, CIS's determination that RSC's restaurant manager position was not a specialty occupation is dispositive here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not write on a pristine page. Congress has laid out eligibility standards for the granting of H-1B specialty occupation visas. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b). Under these standards, a specialty occupation requires: \"(A) theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge, and (B) attainment of a bachelor's or higher degree in the specific specialty (or its equivalent) as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1184(i)(1). The statute also sets forth requirements pertaining to licensure (not applicable here) and providing for due recognition of experience and expertise. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1184(i)(2). Agency regulations flesh out these requirements. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 214.2(h). The regulations define a specialty occupation as:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">an occupation which requires theoretical and practical application of a body of highly specialized knowledge in fields of human endeavor including, but not limited to, architecture, engineering, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences, medicine and health, education, business specialties, accounting, law, theology, and the arts, and which requires the attainment of a bachelor's degree or higher in a specific specialty, or its equivalent, as a minimum for entry into the occupation in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> &#167; 214.2(h)(4)(ii). To satisfy this definition, a position must touch at least one of four overlapping bases. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 214.2(h)(4)(iii)(A). These bases are set out in the margin.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The burden of proving that a particular position comes within this taxonomy (and, thus, qualifies as a specialty occupation) is on the applicant. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1361.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we examine what transpired here. CIS, relying in part on the United States Department of Labor's occupational outlook handbook (the Handbook), determined that the plaintiffs failed to show that the restaurant manager position touched any of the four specified bases. In that regard, the agency found that the duties of the position were not more complex than those associated with similar (non-specialty) positions in the general economy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs attack CIS's analysis on several fronts. First, they take aim at the agency's use of the Handbook, which recounts the particulars of numerous occupations. This array includes \"food service managers,\" and CIS placed RSC's restaurant manager position within that niche. Doing so was an error, the plaintiffs claim, because that placement lumped RSC's establishment with less toney establishments (such as fast-food and chain restaurants). Relatedly, the plaintiffs argue that slavish devotion to the Handbook led CIS to ignore evidence demonstrating RSC's uniquely complex and specialized needs. We address these arguments in the ensemble.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Congress has entrusted an agency with rulemaking and administrative authority, courts ordinarily afford considerable deference to the agency's interpretation of the regulations that it has promulgated under that authority. <i>See Bowles v.

Subject only to caveats at the outer fringes, the choice of what reference materials to consult is quintessentially within an agency's discretion &#8212; and, thus, courts routinely have approved CIS's practice of consulting the Handbook. <i>See, e.g., Blacher v.

Based on the evidence before it, the agency fairly summarized the duties of RSC's restaurant manager position as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[The restaurant manager] would be in charge of all operations, and he will perform duties that entail, in part: hiring, firing, and supervising employees; contacting suppliers and ordering supplies; promoting the restaurant; designing the layout of the restaurant and its equipment; estimating food and beverage costs and requisitions; conferring with food preparation and other personnel to plan menus and related activities; investigating and resolving food quality and service complaints; and handling all financial matters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These tasks appear a good match for the duties of a food service manager, which the 2004-05 Handbook describes, in pertinent part, as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Food service managers are responsible for the daily operations of restaurants and other establishments that prepare and serve meals and beverages to customers. Besides coordinating activities among various departments, such as kitchen, dining room, and banquet operations, food service managers ensure that customers are satisfied with their dining experience. In addition, they oversee the inventory and ordering of food, equipment, and supplies and arrange for the routine maintenance and upkeep of the restaurant, its equipment, and facilities. Managers generally are responsible for all of the administrative and human-resource functions of running the business, including recruiting new employees and monitoring employee performance and training.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The positions coincide in two other salient respects as well. First, RSC has singled out fluency in English and Thai as an important asset for its position. Correspondingly, the Handbook notes that food service managers \"need to speak well, often in several languages, with a diverse clientele and staff.\" Second, RSC projected an annual salary of $40,000 for the restaurant manager position. This is roughly comparable to the median annual earnings of a food service manager for a full-service restaurant in 2002 as per the Handbook ($37,280).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs' attempt to pass off the Handbook classification as suitable only for fast-food and chain restaurants is unavailing. A fair reading makes clear that the Handbook contemplates that the food service manager heading is to cover both full-service restaurants and less upscale operations. To cinch matters, the plaintiffs identify no other Handbook classification that is more apropos. We conclude, therefore, that it was well within the realm of the agency's discretion to seek guidance from the Handbook and, having done so, to refer to the food service manager heading.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We also uphold the agency's determination that the restaurant manager position is not one that by its nature demands a bachelor's degree or its equivalent in a specific specialty. The Handbook makes pellucid that, in hiring restaurant managers, employers seek candidates with a wide variety of backgrounds and credentials, including graduates of hospitality management programs (some of which confer bachelor's degrees and some of which do not), persons trained in-house, and those with hands-on experience gained elsewhere. There is nothing in the record that compels, or even strongly supports, a conclusion that a bachelor's degree or its equivalent is a necessary credential for a restaurant manager.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In urging a contrary finding, the plaintiffs argue that there is evidence in the record to the effect that a bachelor's degree is the industry standard. That argument is disingenuous. The only \"evidence\" to which the plaintiffs point comprises, in its entirety, a one-paragraph statement furnished by a single restauranteur at RSC's request. The statement asserts that every applicant for a managerial position <i>at that particular eatery</i> is expected to have a degree in business administration. As CIS reasonably concluded, however, a bald assertion about the practices of a lone competitor, by itself, does not suffice to prove an industry-wide standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs have another shot in their sling. They contend that, even if a bachelor's degree is not generally required for restaurant managers, RSC is in need of a restaurant manager with a degree in business administration and related work experience. That argument does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The courts and the agency consistently have stated that, although a general-purpose bachelor's degree, such as a business administration degree, may be a legitimate prerequisite for a particular position, requiring such a degree, without more, will not justify the granting of a petition for an H-1B specialty occupation visa. <i>See, e.g., Tapis Int'l v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2568841\"><a href=\"/opinion/2568841/tapis-intern-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Matter of Michael Hertz Assocs.,</i> 19 I &amp; N Dec. 558, 560 (BIA 1988) (providing frequently cited analysis in connection with a conceptually similar provision). This is as it should be: elsewise, an employer could ensure the granting of a specialty occupation visa petition by the simple expedient of creating a generic (and essentially artificial) degree requirement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We hasten to emphasize that a degree requirement in a specific specialty &#8212; one that relates directly to the duties and responsibilities of a particular position &#8212; is given more weight by the agency than a requirement for a generic degree. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 214.2(h)(4)(ii). This gloss is mandated by the language of the statute itself. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1184(i)(1). Given this distinction, we cannot fault CIS's determination that RSC's requirement for a free-floating degree in business administration was insufficient, without some compelling connection to the responsibilities of the restaurant manager position, to require a finding of a specialty occupation here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rejection of these legal arguments brings us to the question of whether the agency, on the record as a whole, made a reasonable decision. The record reveals that CIS considered all the relevant facts and produced a closely reasoned judgment as to the nature of the work involved in the restaurant manager position. In the absence of an error of law &#8212; and we see none here &#8212; this case comes down to straight abuse-of-discretion review. Under that standard, the outcome is foreordained. While the APA authorizes a reviewing court to set aside an agency's \"action, findings, [or] conclusions\" if they are \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not in accordance with law,\" 5 U.S.C. &#167; 706(2)(A), an agency's decision does not trigger that provision as long as it correctly explicates the governing law and turns on a plausible rendition of the facts in the record.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Granite State Concrete Co. v. Surface Transp.

In determining that the position in question did not warrant the granting of a petition for a specialty occupation visa, CIS has not operated outside the wide margins of this discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Of course, the plaintiffs also ask us to factor into the mix CIS's earlier granting of the 1999 specialty occupation visa petition.

We have reiterated, with a regularity bordering on the echolalic, that estoppel rarely will be invoked against the federal government. <i>See, e.g., Frillz, Inc. v. Lader,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197166\"><a href=\"/opinion/197166/frillz-v-lader/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span>, 518 (1st Cir.1997); <i>United States v.

That principle holds fast in immigration cases. <i>See, e.g., Costa v.

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We end with a succinct summary. For the reasons elucidated above, we bypass the jurisdictional question. On the merits, the ultimate decision about whether to grant a petition for a specialty occupation visa lies within the discretion of the agency. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1184(a)(1). Because CIS's exercise of discretion here is untainted by either legal or factual error, we discern no basis for disturbing its denial of RSC's petition. Finally, we reject out of hand the plaintiffs' entreaty that estoppel should carry the day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> We hold, without serious question, that the district court did not err in granting summary judgment for the defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> We have substituted Michael Chertoff as the lead defendant in place of Tom Ridge, his predecessor in office<i>See</i> Fed.

By like token, we have no need to address either the soundness or the applicability of the government's suggestion that the APA itself (specifically, 5 U.S.C. &#167; 701(a)(2)) may foreclose judicial review of a nonimmigrant visitor's request for an extension of stay</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
