Girón-Anadón, Assistant Solicitor General,\nDepartment of Justice, with whom Salvador J. Antonetti-Stutts,\nSolicitor General, Mariana D. Negrón-Vargas, Deputy Solicitor\nGeneral and Maite Oronoz-Rodríguez, Deputy Solicitor General,\nwere on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                           February 12, 2007\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Tenth Circuit, Sitting by designation.\n\f               Per Curiam. Plaintiffs Rafael Balaguer, Jose Irizarry,\n\nIgnacio Echevarria, Felix Casiano, Jose Collazo, Maribel Rivera,\n\nJorge Maldonado, and Ivette Maldonado brought this action under 42\n\nU.S.C.    §    1983     against     defendant      government       officials       Ileana\n\nEchegoyen, Julia Torres, Arlene Rivera, Giovanny Llorens, Gonzalo\n\nGarcia,       Esperanza    Molina,        Lydia    Fernandez,       and   Ana     Yolanda\n\nGonzalez,      claiming     that     defendants         violated    their      First   and\n\nFourteenth Amendment rights by discriminating against them on\n\naccount   of     their     political      affiliation.1        The    district       court\n\ngranted       summary     judgment    to     the    defendants,       and    plaintiffs\n\nappealed.\n\n                                            I.\n\n               As we write primarily for the parties, we will recount\n\nonly   those      facts     essential       to    our    analysis.        In      essence,\n\nplaintiffs,      all     current     or    former       employees    of     the    Housing\n\nDevelopment and Improvement administration (HDIA), complain of\n\ntheir treatment following the change in government after the 2000\n\nelections.       Plaintiffs, who are members of the New Progressive\n\nParty (\"NPP\"), maintain that defendants, who are members of the\n\nPopular   Democratic        Party    (\"PDP\"),       took   discriminatory          actions\n\nagainst them based upon their political allegiance.                          As did the\n\ndistrict court in considering their claims, we may group the\n\n\n\n1\n Appellants focus upon their political discrimination claims rather\nthan their due process claims on appeal.\n\n                                            -3-\n\fplaintiffs      into   three    categories.        The    first   group,   Rafael\n\nBalaguer, Felix Casiano, Ignacio Echevarria, and Jose Irizarry,\n\ncontests the closing of the Guanica office and their transfer to\n\nthe Mayaguez office (\"Guanica plaintiffs\"). The Guanica plaintiffs\n\nassert that defendants closed the Guanica office to unfairly\n\ndeprive them of their supervisory functions.                  The second group,\n\nMaribel Rivera, Jorge Maldonado, and Jose Collazo, contests the\n\ntermination of their irregular employment contracts (\"contract\n\nplaintiffs\").2     The contract plaintiffs assert that the defendants\n\nfailed to renew their contracts to punish them because of their\n\nallegiance to the NPP.           Lastly, there is Ivette Maldonado, who\n\nclaims to have been deprived of her normal duties, assigned to\n\ntasks for which she had no training, and harassed, all because of\n\nher NPP membership.\n\n            The district court concluded that none of the plaintiffs\n\nhad established a prima facie case, largely based upon the lack of\n\nevidence    that   defendants      were   aware    of     plaintiffs'   political\n\naffiliation and/or because plaintiffs could not link the disputed\n\nactions    to   political      animus.     The    court    also   concluded   that\n\nplaintiffs could not refute defendants' tendered nondiscriminatory\n\n\n\n\n2\n All three worked on temporary contracts of three to six months,\nwith renewal contingent upon the agency's needs and available\nbudget. Rivera and Maldonado's contracts expired in March 2002,\nwhile Collazo's contract expired in September 2001.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fexplanation that budgetary problems had prompted the challenged\n\nactions.\n\n                                         II.\n\n              All plaintiffs claim that there was sufficient evidence\n\nto create a triable issue of defendants' motive for taking the\n\ndisputed employment actions.\n\n              We review the granting of summary judgment de novo,\n\nassessing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty.    Nieves-Luciano v. Hernandez-Torres,               397 F.3d 1, 3-4 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).      Summary judgment is proper only if there is no genuine\n\nissue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment\n\nas a matter of law.           See Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).           In reviewing a\n\nsummary       judgment     decision,    \"we    do     not   consider     conclusory\n\nallegations, improbable inferences, and unsupported speculation.\"\n\nVelez-Rivera        v.    Agosto-Alicea,      437   F.3d    145,   154   (1st   Cir.\n\n2006)(internal citation and quotation omitted).\n\n              To briefly recap the standards for establishing liability\n\nunder § 1983, \"plaintiffs must show by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence that:           (1) the challenged conduct was attributable to a\n\nperson acting under color of state law; and (2) the conduct\n\ndeprived the plaintiff of rights secured by the Constitution or\n\nlaws of the United States.\"             Velez-Rivera, 437 F.3d at 151-52.\n\nThere    is    no   dispute    that    the    First   Amendment    protects     non-\n\n\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fpolicymaking public employees from adverse employment actions based\n\nupon their political views.          Id. at 152.\n\n            \"When alleging a claim of political discrimination, a\n\nplaintiff   bears    the    burden   of   producing   sufficient    evidence,\n\nwhether     direct    or     circumstantial,       that    he    engaged   in\n\nconstitutionally protected conduct and that political affiliation\n\nwas a substantial or motivating factor behind the challenged\n\nemployment action.\"        Nieves-Luciano, 397 F.3d at 4.       In general, a\n\nplaintiff must \"make four showings to prove a case of political\n\ndiscrimination: (1) the plaintiff and the defendant belong to\n\nopposing political affiliations; (2) the defendant has knowledge of\n\nthe plaintiff's opposing political affiliation; (3) there is a\n\nchallenged employment action; and (4) sufficient evidence, whether\n\ndirect or circumstantial, . . . that political affiliation was a\n\nsubstantial or motivating factor . . . .\"                 Peguero-Moronta v.\n\nSantiago, 464 F.3d 29, 48 (1st Cir. 2006)(internal citation and\n\nquotation omitted).          Once a plaintiff satisfies this initial\n\nburden, defendants must \"demonstrate that (i) they would have taken\n\nthe same action in any event; and (ii) they would have taken such\n\naction for reasons that are not unconstitutional.\"              Velez-Rivera,\n\n437 F.3d at 152 (citing Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v.\n\nDoyle, 429 U.S. 274, 286-87 (1977)).          If the defendant makes such\n\na showing, the plaintiff may attempt to discredit the tendered\n\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fnondiscriminatory      reason     with   either   direct   or    circumstantial\n\nevidence.    Velez-Rivera, 437 F.3d at 153.\n\nGuanica Plaintiffs\n\n            The Guanica plaintiffs argue that the Guanica office was\n\nclosed to punish them for their political allegiance and deprive\n\nthem (particularly Balaguer) of their supervisory responsibilities.\n\nGuanica plaintiffs further contend that defendants' explanation for\n\nthe closure is unsupported by the evidence.                  Even giving the\n\nGuanica plaintiffs the benefit of the doubt on their prima facie\n\ncase, they have failed to overcome the defendants' defense that\n\nthey closed the office for a nondiscriminatory reason.\n\n            Defendants asserted that the closing of the Guanica\n\noffice was brought about solely by budgetary concerns, and offered\n\nthe following facts in support of their position:                (1) HDIA   faced\n\na 7% budget decrease; (2) defendants decided to close certain local\n\noffices to consolidate services in the regional offices and reduce\n\noperating expenses; (3) four local offices (including Guanica) were\n\nclosed and their employees transferred to the appropriate regional\n\noffice;   (4)   each   of   the    closed      local   offices   had   employees\n\nbelonging to both political parties; and (5) the Guanica office is\n\nclosed and no employee, of either party, reports to work there.\n\n            To counter these facts, the Guanica plaintiffs first\n\noffer some ambiguous comments by Secretary Echegoyen about whether\n\nshe was specifically notified of and participated in the decision\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fto close the offices, or just generally advised about the need to\n\neconomize because of the budget reduction. This quibbling does not\n\nundermine    the    underlying   explanation         by    defendants.       Second,\n\nplaintiffs state, without elaboration, that three PDP members still\n\nwork in the town of Guanica.         This fact is of little value to their\n\ncase, given that plaintiffs concede that the Guanica HDIA office is\n\nno longer operating, and that no one reports there.                             Third,\n\nplaintiffs argue that no \"formal study\" was done to evaluate the\n\nadvantages    and    disadvantages     of    closing        the   Guanica    office.\n\nHowever, the defendants maintain that the viability of the various\n\noffices, if not formally studied, was fully considered, and the\n\nGuanica plaintiffs do not meaningfully contest this.                        On this\n\nrecord, the Guanica plaintiffs have failed to show a material\n\ndispute concerning defendants' tendered explanation for closing the\n\nGuanica office.       Contrast Padilla-Garcia v. Guillermo Rodriguez,\n\n212 F.3d 69, 78 (1st Cir. 2000) (that only plaintiff impacted by\n\n\"restructuring\"       of   department        casts        doubt   on     defendant's\n\nexplanation).\n\nContract Plaintiffs\n\n            The contract plaintiffs maintain that their irregular\n\ncontracts    were    not   renewed    solely    to    punish      them    for   their\n\npolitical allegiance.        While conceding that they were renewed on\n\nmultiple occasions after the elections, the contract plaintiffs\n\nmaintain that defendants eventually saw an opportunity to remove\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fthem   based   upon   their    political     views.   They   also    claim   that\n\ndefendants' stated justification - a lack of funds - was mere\n\npretext, as the plaintiffs were replaced by members of the PDP.                As\n\nwith the Guanica plaintiffs, we conclude that summary judgment was\n\nproperly granted.\n\n            We begin with the contract plaintiffs' prima facie cases.\n\nThe record reveals little evidence that the relevant decision-\n\nmakers   were     aware   of     the    contract      plaintiffs'     political\n\naffiliation.     In essence, the contract plaintiffs, all low level\n\nfunctionaries, claim that the various defendants \"must have known\"\n\nthem because they worked at the agency, \"must have known\" their\n\npolitical      affiliation     because       the   defendants       could    have\n\ninvestigated it and found out, and \"must have discriminated\"\n\nagainst them because their contracts were not renewed.                       These\n\nassertions are inadequate to state a prima facie case however, for,\n\nas we noted in Mercado-Alicea v. P.R. Tourism Co., 396 F.3d 46, 52\n\n(1st Cir. 2005), merely juxtaposing the decision-maker's politics\n\nagainst an adverse employment decision is insufficient to support\n\na claim of political discrimination.\n\n            Moreover, the contract plaintiffs have failed to cast any\n\ndoubt on the defendants' Mt. Healthy defense.                   We begin with\n\nplaintiff Collazo, who conceded at his deposition that he was based\n\nin Guanica as a title searcher, that the Guanica office did not\n\nemploy a title searcher after his departure, and that the Guanica\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\foffice was closed very shortly after his contract was not renewed.\n\nIn light of these concessions, it is difficult to see pretext in\n\ndefendants' explanation that his contract was not renewed for\n\nbudgetary reasons.    Moreover, his contention that other title\n\nsearchers were hired \"island wide\" does not address the relevant\n\nquestion: whether his contract services were needed in Guanica.\n\nPlaintiff Maldonado's claim that he was replaced also fails, as he\n\nconceded at his deposition that no one filled his position after he\n\nwas terminated. As to plaintiff Rivera, she claims that, after her\n\ntermination, she was temporarily replaced by two employees from\n\nanother office and that defendant Lydia Fernandez's cousin (who\n\nRivera surmises belongs to the PDP) was placed in Rivera's old\n\nposition (with the same title and salary) by the end of the year.\n\nNeither claim holds up under scrutiny.    First, that two current\n\nemployees were temporarily transferred to perform Rivera's duties,\n\nas opposed to a new hire, does not by itself refute the defendants'\n\nbudgetary shortfall explanation.   Second, as to the employment of\n\ndefendant Fernandez's cousin, Rivera relies largely on Fernandez's\n\nanswer to an interrogatory, in which she states that her cousin did\n\nstart to work in the office, but the interrogatory answer says\n\nnothing about the employee's title or duties, and moreover it\n\nasserts that the cousin's contract was separately funded.     That\n\nevidence does not support Rivera's assertion of a material factual\n\ndispute.\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fIvette Maldonado\n\n          Lastly, plaintiff Maldonado argues that she established\n\nher prima facie case, but presents no challenge to the district\n\ncourt's acceptance of defendants' Mt. Healthy defense.                    Thus,\n\nMaldonado has abandoned any challenge to the district court's\n\nconclusion.   See     In   re   Miles,   436   F.3d   291,   294   (1st    Cir.\n\n2006)(failure to challenge district court's reasonable rationale is\n\nfatal to an appeal); Horizon Bank & Trust Co. v. Massachusetts, 391\n\nF.3d 48, 53 (1st Cir. 2004)(failure to appeal both of district\n\ncourt's alternative grounds for result moots the appeal because\n\nreviewing court can give no effective relief).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f",

Plaintiffs Rafael Balaguer, Jose Irizarry,\n\nIgnacio Echevarria, Felix Casiano, Jose Collazo, Maribel Rivera,\n\nJorge Maldonado, and Ivette Maldonado brought this action under 42\n\nU.S.C.    §    1983     against     defendant      government       officials       Ileana\n\nEchegoyen, Julia Torres, Arlene Rivera, Giovanny Llorens, Gonzalo\n\nGarcia,       Esperanza    Molina,        Lydia    Fernandez,       and   Ana     Yolanda\n\nGonzalez,      claiming     that     defendants         violated    their      First   and\n\nFourteenth Amendment rights by discriminating against them on\n\naccount   of     their     political      affiliation.1        The    district       court\n\ngranted       summary     judgment    to     the    defendants,       and    plaintiffs\n\nappealed.\n\n                                            I.\n\n               As we write primarily for the parties, we will recount\n\nonly   those      facts     essential       to    our    analysis.        In      essence,\n\nplaintiffs,      all     current     or    former       employees    of     the    Housing\n\nDevelopment and Improvement administration (HDIA), complain of\n\ntheir treatment following the change in government after the 2000\n\nelections.       Plaintiffs, who are members of the New Progressive\n\nParty (\"NPP\"), maintain that defendants, who are members of the\n\nPopular   Democratic        Party    (\"PDP\"),       took   discriminatory          actions\n\nagainst them based upon their political allegiance.                          As did the\n\ndistrict court in considering their claims, we may group the\n\n\n\n1\n Appellants focus upon their political discrimination claims rather\nthan their due process claims on appeal.\n\n                                            -3-\n\fplaintiffs      into   three    categories.        The    first   group,   Rafael\n\nBalaguer, Felix Casiano, Ignacio Echevarria, and Jose Irizarry,\n\ncontests the closing of the Guanica office and their transfer to\n\nthe Mayaguez office (\"Guanica plaintiffs\"). The Guanica plaintiffs\n\nassert that defendants closed the Guanica office to unfairly\n\ndeprive them of their supervisory functions.                  The second group,\n\nMaribel Rivera, Jorge Maldonado, and Jose Collazo, contests the\n\ntermination of their irregular employment contracts (\"contract\n\nplaintiffs\").2     The contract plaintiffs assert that the defendants\n\nfailed to renew their contracts to punish them because of their\n\nallegiance to the NPP.           Lastly, there is Ivette Maldonado, who\n\nclaims to have been deprived of her normal duties, assigned to\n\ntasks for which she had no training, and harassed, all because of\n\nher NPP membership.\n\n            The district court concluded that none of the plaintiffs\n\nhad established a prima facie case, largely based upon the lack of\n\nevidence    that   defendants      were   aware    of     plaintiffs'   political\n\naffiliation and/or because plaintiffs could not link the disputed\n\nactions    to   political      animus.     The    court    also   concluded   that\n\nplaintiffs could not refute defendants' tendered nondiscriminatory\n\n\n\n\n2\n All three worked on temporary contracts of three to six months,\nwith renewal contingent upon the agency's needs and available\nbudget. Rivera and Maldonado's contracts expired in March 2002,\nwhile Collazo's contract expired in September 2001.\n\n                                         -4-\n\fexplanation that budgetary problems had prompted the challenged\n\nactions.\n\n                                         II.\n\n              All plaintiffs claim that there was sufficient evidence\n\nto create a triable issue of defendants' motive for taking the\n\ndisputed employment actions.\n\n              We review the granting of summary judgment de novo,\n\nassessing the record in the light most favorable to the nonmoving\n\nparty.

Velez-Rivera, 437 F.3d at 153.\n\nGuanica Plaintiffs\n\n            The Guanica plaintiffs argue that the Guanica office was\n\nclosed to punish them for their political allegiance and deprive\n\nthem (particularly Balaguer) of their supervisory responsibilities.\n\nGuanica plaintiffs further contend that defendants' explanation for\n\nthe closure is unsupported by the evidence.                  Even giving the\n\nGuanica plaintiffs the benefit of the doubt on their prima facie\n\ncase, they have failed to overcome the defendants' defense that\n\nthey closed the office for a nondiscriminatory reason.\n\n            Defendants asserted that the closing of the Guanica\n\noffice was brought about solely by budgetary concerns, and offered\n\nthe following facts in support of their position:                (1) HDIA   faced\n\na 7% budget decrease; (2) defendants decided to close certain local\n\noffices to consolidate services in the regional offices and reduce\n\noperating expenses; (3) four local offices (including Guanica) were\n\nclosed and their employees transferred to the appropriate regional\n\noffice;   (4)   each   of   the    closed      local   offices   had   employees\n\nbelonging to both political parties; and (5) the Guanica office is\n\nclosed and no employee, of either party, reports to work there.\n\n            To counter these facts, the Guanica plaintiffs first\n\noffer some ambiguous comments by Secretary Echegoyen about whether\n\nshe was specifically notified of and participated in the decision\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\fto close the offices, or just generally advised about the need to\n\neconomize because of the budget reduction. This quibbling does not\n\nundermine    the    underlying   explanation         by    defendants.       Second,\n\nplaintiffs state, without elaboration, that three PDP members still\n\nwork in the town of Guanica.         This fact is of little value to their\n\ncase, given that plaintiffs concede that the Guanica HDIA office is\n\nno longer operating, and that no one reports there.                             Third,\n\nplaintiffs argue that no \"formal study\" was done to evaluate the\n\nadvantages    and    disadvantages     of    closing        the   Guanica    office.\n\nHowever, the defendants maintain that the viability of the various\n\noffices, if not formally studied, was fully considered, and the\n\nGuanica plaintiffs do not meaningfully contest this.                        On this\n\nrecord, the Guanica plaintiffs have failed to show a material\n\ndispute concerning defendants' tendered explanation for closing the\n\nGuanica office.       Contrast Padilla-Garcia v. Guillermo Rodriguez,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198926\"><a href=\"/opinion/198926/padilla-garcia-v-guillermo-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 78 (1st Cir. 2000) (that only plaintiff impacted by\n\n\"restructuring\"       of   department        casts        doubt   on     defendant's\n\nexplanation).\n\nContract Plaintiffs\n\n            The contract plaintiffs maintain that their irregular\n\ncontracts    were    not   renewed    solely    to    punish      them    for   their\n\npolitical allegiance.        While conceding that they were renewed on\n\nmultiple occasions after the elections, the contract plaintiffs\n\nmaintain that defendants eventually saw an opportunity to remove\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fthem   based   upon   their    political     views.   They   also    claim   that\n\ndefendants' stated justification - a lack of funds - was mere\n\npretext, as the plaintiffs were replaced by members of the PDP.                As\n\nwith the Guanica plaintiffs, we conclude that summary judgment was\n\nproperly granted.\n\n            We begin with the contract plaintiffs' prima facie cases.\n\nThe record reveals little evidence that the relevant decision-\n\nmakers   were     aware   of     the    contract      plaintiffs'     political\n\naffiliation.     In essence, the contract plaintiffs, all low level\n\nfunctionaries, claim that the various defendants \"must have known\"\n\nthem because they worked at the agency, \"must have known\" their\n\npolitical      affiliation     because       the   defendants       could    have\n\ninvestigated it and found out, and \"must have discriminated\"\n\nagainst them because their contracts were not renewed.                       These\n\nassertions are inadequate to state a prima facie case however, for,\n\nas we noted in Mercado-Alicea v. P.R. Tourism Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201418\"><a href=\"/opinion/201418/mercado-alicea-v-pr-tourism-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">396</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 52\n\n(1st Cir. 2005), merely juxtaposing the decision-maker's politics\n\nagainst an adverse employment decision is insufficient to support\n\na claim of political discrimination.\n\n            Moreover, the contract plaintiffs have failed to cast any\n\ndoubt on the defendants' Mt. Healthy defense.                   We begin with\n\nplaintiff Collazo, who conceded at his deposition that he was based\n\nin Guanica as a title searcher, that the Guanica office did not\n\nemploy a title searcher after his departure, and that the Guanica\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\foffice was closed very shortly after his contract was not renewed.\n\nIn light of these concessions, it is difficult to see pretext in\n\ndefendants' explanation that his contract was not renewed for\n\nbudgetary reasons.    Moreover, his contention that other title\n\nsearchers were hired \"island wide\" does not address the relevant\n\nquestion: whether his contract services were needed in Guanica.\n\nPlaintiff Maldonado's claim that he was replaced also fails, as he\n\nconceded at his deposition that no one filled his position after he\n\nwas terminated. As to plaintiff Rivera, she claims that, after her\n\ntermination, she was temporarily replaced by two employees from\n\nanother office and that defendant Lydia Fernandez's cousin (who\n\nRivera surmises belongs to the PDP) was placed in Rivera's old\n\nposition (with the same title and salary) by the end of the year.\n\nNeither claim holds up under scrutiny.    First, that two current\n\nemployees were temporarily transferred to perform Rivera's duties,\n\nas opposed to a new hire, does not by itself refute the defendants'\n\nbudgetary shortfall explanation.   Second, as to the employment of\n\ndefendant Fernandez's cousin, Rivera relies largely on Fernandez's\n\nanswer to an interrogatory, in which she states that her cousin did\n\nstart to work in the office, but the interrogatory answer says\n\nnothing about the employee's title or duties, and moreover it\n\nasserts that the cousin's contract was separately funded.     That\n\nevidence does not support Rivera's assertion of a material factual\n\ndispute.\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fIvette Maldonado\n\n          Lastly, plaintiff Maldonado argues that she established\n\nher prima facie case, but presents no challenge to the district\n\ncourt's acceptance of defendants' Mt. Healthy defense.                    Thus,\n\nMaldonado has abandoned any challenge to the district court's\n\nconclusion.
