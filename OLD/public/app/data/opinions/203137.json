John A.

This lawsuit arises from a\n\nbusiness   partnership      gone      sour.       Plaintiff-appellee      Combined\n\nEnergies (\"CE\") filed suit in Maine federal district court against\n\nDefendant-appellant CCI, Inc. (\"CCI\"), alleging various contract\n\nand tort claims related to what CE describes as a raid on CE's\n\nworkforce subsequent to a failed take-over attempt by its erstwhile\n\nbusiness partner CCI. CCI moved to stay the proceedings and compel\n\narbitration.     The district court denied the motion and, holding\n\nthat CE's claims do not fall within the scope of the parties'\n\narbitration agreement, we affirm.\n\n                                 I.    Background\n\n           CE    is     a   Maine     construction       and     energy   services\n\nsubcontractor.        CCI is an Alaskan prime contractor.             CE and CCI\n\nentered into a business relationship for the purposes of developing\n\nand   performing      projects      for    the    U.S.   Navy.      The   business\n\nrelationship was formalized in three key agreements.                  The Teaming\n\nAgreement (\"TA\"), signed in late December 2004, established CCI as\n\nthe prime contractor and CE as the subcontractor for a project\n\nproposal   to   be     submitted      to    the   U.S.   Navy.      The   TA   also\n\ncontemplated other Navy contract opportunities.                   After the Navy\n\naccepted the proposal and awarded the contract to CCI, CCI and CE\n\nconcluded a Strategic Alliance Agreement (\"SAA\") on August 23,\n\n2005, a short document in which the parties stated their intention\n\n\"to strategically align themselves with one another in order to\n\n\n                                           -2-\n\fpromote and utilize their respective expertise for the purpose of\n\ndeveloping and performing projects . . . .\"                  That same day, the\n\nparties also entered into a Purchase Order Agreement (\"POA\") laying\n\nout the standard terms and conditions applicable to each party's\n\nperformance of the Navy contract.\n\n            It appears that the parties proceeded to perform as\n\ndirected    by    the   above   triumvirate     of    agreements     until    their\n\nrelationship broke down irretrievably in late 2006.                   CE alleges\n\nthat CCI inquired about purchasing its business on October 15,\n\n2006, an offer that CE declined.           According to CE, CCI then set out\n\nto \"raid what it could not buy,\" by \"preventing CE from performing\n\nits   obligations       under   existing    contracts,    preventing     CE    from\n\nobtaining   new     contracts,     damaging    CE's    good   reputation,\"      and\n\nfilching CE's entire workforce.            CE was subject to a spate of mass\n\nresignations in early January 2007; the majority of the resignation\n\nletters, which are attached to CE's complaint, state that the\n\nsender had accepted or intended to accept a position with CCI.\n\n            On February 1, 2007, CE filed suit against CCI in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Maine, alleging\n\ntortious interference with its business; unjust enrichment; breach\n\nof the TA and SAA; breach of implied covenants including the duty\n\nof good faith and fair dealing; and defamation and slander per se.\n\nArguing    that    an   arbitration    clause    in    the    POA   mandated    the\n\nsubmission of CE's claims to arbitration, CCI timely moved to stay\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fthe proceedings and compel arbitration; CE opposed the motion.      On\n\nMarch 14, 2007, the district court denied CCI's motion, finding\n\nthat it could not conclude that \"the arbitration clause in a\n\nconstruction contract encompasses a law suit alleging multiple\n\nviolations of tort and contract law from the unsavory tactics CE\n\nclaims CCI used in a bid to take-over its business.\"\n\n           Pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), this\n\ncourt has jurisdiction to review the district court's interlocutory\n\norder denying CCI's request for a stay and motion to compel\n\narbitration. See 9 U.S.C. §§ 16(a)(1)(A), 16(a)(1)(B); Campbell v.\n\nGen. Dynamics Gov't Sys. Corp., 407 F.3d 546, 550 (1st Cir. 2005).1\n\n                           II.   Discussion\n\n           We are not now tasked with deciding upon the merits vel\n\nnon   of   CE's   claims   against   CCI,   but   rather   upon   their\n\n\n\n      1\n       The FAA provides that:\n          A written provision in . . . a contract\n          evidencing a transaction involving commerce to\n          settle by arbitration a controversy thereafter\n          arising out of such contract or transaction,\n          or the refusal to perform the whole or any\n          part thereof, or an agreement in writing to\n          submit to arbitration an existing controversy\n          arising out of such a contract, transaction,\n          or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and\n          enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist\n          at law or in equity for the revocation of any\n          contract.\n9 U.S.C. § 2. The POA containing the arbitration clause at issue\nhere is a contract in interstate commerce because it is an\nagreement between Alaskan and Maine corporations to perform work\nfor the U.S. Navy; thus, this dispute is within the purview of the\nFAA.\n\n                                  -4-\n\farbitrability.             \"[A]rbitrability              depends      on     contract\n\ninterpretation, which is a question of law.\" Keystone Shipping Co.\n\nv.   New   England     Power        Co.,    109      F.3d      46,   50    (1st     Cir.\n\n1997)(alteration in original)(quoting PaineWebber Inc. v. Elahi, 87\n\nF.3d 589, 592 (1st Cir. 1996))(internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nAccordingly, \"[w]e evaluate the district court's denial of a motion\n\nto compel arbitration de novo.\"                  Kristian v. Comcast Corp., 446\n\nF.3d 25, 31 (1st. Cir. 2006)(citing Campbell, 407 F.3d at 551).\n\n           When deciding a motion to compel arbitration, a court\n\nmust determine whether \"(i) there exists a written agreement to\n\narbitrate,    (ii)   the    dispute        falls    within     the   scope    of    that\n\narbitration agreement, and (iii) the party seeking an arbitral\n\nforum   has   not    waived        its   right      to   arbitration.\"            Bangor\n\nHydro-Electric Co. v. New England Tel. & Tel. Co., 62 F. Supp. 2d\n\n152, 155 (D. Me. 1999).        Only if all three prongs of the test are\n\nsatisfied will a motion to compel arbitration be granted.                          Here,\n\nprongs (i) and (iii) are not at issue; the outcome of this case,\n\ntherefore, turns entirely on whether the dispute is of a kind that\n\nthe parties had agreed to submit to arbitration.\n\n           Whether a claim falls within the reach of a particular\n\narbitration   clause    is     a    question       for   the    district     court    to\n\ndetermine initially as a matter of law.                  See Acevedo Maldonado v.\n\nPPG Indus., Inc., 514 F.2d 614, 616 (1st Cir. 1975).                          Federal\n\npolicy favors arbitration.           See Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fChrysler-Plymouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 626 (1985)(\"The Arbitration\n\nAct establishes that, as a matter of federal law, any doubts\n\nconcerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in\n\nfavor of arbitration . . . .\")(internal quotations omitted).\n\nHowever, \"arbitration is simply a matter of contract between the\n\nparties;     it    is   a    way   to     resolve      disputes–but    only    those\n\ndisputes–that the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.\"\n\nFirst Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938, 943 (1995).\n\nCCI   exhorts     us    that     arbitration      clauses    must     be   construed\n\nliberally,    while     CE     cautions    that   it    cannot   be   compelled   to\n\narbitrate claims that it did not consent to arbitrate.                     At bottom,\n\nhowever, federal policy merely \"guarantee[s] the enforcement of\n\nprivate contractual arrangements\" by creating \"a body of federal\n\nsubstantive law establishing and regulating the duty to honor an\n\nagreement to arbitrate.\"           Mitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 625 (internal\n\nquotations omitted).\n\n           Therefore, \"[w]hen deciding whether the parties agreed to\n\narbitrate a certain matter . . . , courts generally . . . should\n\napply ordinary state-law principles that govern the formation of\n\ncontracts.\"       First Options, 514 U.S. at 944.             Under Maine law, a\n\ncontract\n\n           is to be construed in accordance with the\n           intention of the parties, which is to be\n           ascertained from an examination of the\n           instrument as a whole. All parts and clauses\n           must be considered together that it may be\n           seen if and how far one clause is explained,\n\n                                          -6-\n\f          modified,   limited,    or    controlled   by   the\n          others.\n\nPeerless Ins. Co. v. Brennan, 564 A.2d 383, 385 (Me. 1989).\n\n          In support of its argument that the parties' arbitration\n\nagreement requires arbitration of CE's claims, CCI relies on two\n\nclauses in the POA, which it contends must be read in tandem to\n\nmandate an expansive agreement to arbitrate all disputes between\n\nthe parties.   Paragraph 6.3 of the POA provides:\n\n          All unresolved claims, disputes, and other\n          matters in question between [CCI] and [CE] not\n          relating to claims included in Paragraph 6.22\n          shall be resolved in the manner provided in\n          Article 14.\n\n\nParagraph 14.1, the relevant provision of Article 14, states:\n\n          All claims, disputes and matters in question\n          arising out of, or relating to, this POA or\n          the breach thereof . . . shall be decided by\n          arbitration    in    accordance    with    the\n          Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the\n          American Arbitration Association then in\n          effect unless the parties mutually agree\n          otherwise.\n\n\n          Precedent may counsel us to construe arbitration clauses\n\nliberally, but it does not permit us to read out of an arbitration\n\nclause an explicit limit upon the scope of that clause that has\n\nbeen agreed to by both parties.    Reading 6.3 and 14.1 together as\n\n\n     2\n       Paragraph 6.2 governs POA-related claims against the Navy.\nWe see no need to recite it verbatim here as it is not particularly\nrelevant to this case, although we do note that even that section\nlays out a dispute resolution procedure only for \"dispute[s]\narising under this POA . . . .\" (emphasis added).\n\n                                  -7-\n\fMaine law requires produces not an expansive agreement to arbitrate\n\nbut rather an arbitration clause clearly and on its face limited to\n\n\"[a]ll claims, disputes and matters in question arising out of, or\n\nrelating to, this POA or the breach thereof . . . .\" (emphasis\n\nadded).\n\n          The key question remaining, then, is whether CE's claims\n\narise out of, or relate to, the POA or breach of the POA.     CE's\n\ncontract-related claims reference the TA and the SAA, not the POA;\n\nhowever, it is true that CE cannot avoid arbitration by dint of\n\nartful pleading alone.   See, e.g., Acevedo Maldonado, 514 F.2d at\n\n616 (finding that arbitration clause covered \"contract-generated or\n\ncontract-related disputes between the parties however labeled: it\n\nis immaterial whether claims are in contract or in tort\"); Kiefer\n\nSpecialty Flooring, Inc. v. Tarkett, Inc., 174 F.3d 907, 910 (7th\n\nCir. 1999)(noting that arbitrability of particular claim does not\n\n\"turn on the label—'tort' or 'contract'—a party chose to affix to\n\nthe claim\").   Nevertheless, we agree with the district court that\n\nthe complaint filed by CE cannot be fairly said to arise out of, or\n\nrelate to, the POA in the sense that would be necessary to confer\n\narbitrability in this case. As the district court observed, \"[t]he\n\nComplaint does not claim any disputes between CCI and CE about the\n\nwork CE performed under the POA, about payment in accordance with\n\nthat work, about change orders, delay, quality of workmanship, or\n\nthe myriad of other commonplace controversies between general\n\n\n                                -8-\n\fcontractors and subcontractors.\"       Combined Energies v. CCI, Inc.,\n\n484 F. Supp. 2d 186, 189 (D. Me. 2007).        Indeed, as CE points out,\n\nCE   existed   as   a   business   before   entering   into   any   sort   of\n\nrelationship with CCI and had operations apart from CCI; the\n\ngravamen of CE's allegations--that CCI set upon a course of conduct\n\nthat resulted in the destruction of CE's business--reverberate far\n\nbeyond the POA and would stand regardless of the parties' rights\n\nand responsibilities as defined by that contract.\n\n           CCI next argues that, at the very least, the allegations\n\nin CE's complaint that implicate the SAA must be submitted to\n\narbitration because the SAA is incorporated into the POA and the\n\ntwo documents must be considered and construed as one contract.3\n\nSee Crowe v. Bolduc, 334 F.3d 124, 137 (1st. Cir. 2003)(\"Under\n\nMaine law, in the absence of anything to indicate a contrary\n\nintention, instruments executed at the same time, by the same\n\ncontracting parties, for the same purposes, and in the course of\n\nthe same transaction will be considered and construed together,\n\n\n\n\n      3\n       In its reply brief, CCI asserts that CE's response to this\nargument was cursory and should be deemed waived. See National\nForeign Trade Council v. Natsios, 181 F.3d 38, 61 n.17 (1st Cir.\n1999)(\"[A]rguments raised only in a footnote or in a perfunctory\nmanner are waived.\").     Merely because CE may have waived an\nargument regarding the incorporation of the SAA into the POA,\nhowever -- a matter on which we take no view -- it does not follow\nthat CCI's argument automatically prevails.     We may affirm the\ndistrict court's order \"on any independent ground made manifest by\nthe record.\" Skirchak v. Dynamics Research Corp., 508 F.3d 49, 57\n(1st Cir. 2007).\n\n                                     -9-\n\fsince   they       are,    in     the      eyes   of    the   law,    one     contract     or\n\ninstrument.\")(internal quotations omitted).\n\n            CCI thus is making two conceptually distinct, although\n\nrelated,    arguments           to    advocate         applicability     of     the   POA's\n\narbitration clause to CE's SAA-related claims.                        See In re Olympic\n\nMills Corp., 477 F.3d 1, 14 n.11 (1st Cir. 2007)(\"[The principle\n\narticulated in Crowe] is associated with but distinct from a\n\ncourt's consideration of a separate writing expressly incorporated\n\nby reference . . . . Compare 11 Williston on Contracts § 30:25\n\n('Writing Expressly Incorporated By Reference'), with id. § 30:26\n\n('Writing Implicitly Incorporated By Reference').\").                             Both are\n\nunavailing.        In Crowe, we looked to two agreements executed on the\n\nsame day to resolve a question of contractual ambiguity.                              Here,\n\nthere is no comparable ambiguity.                    \"Where the words of a contract\n\nin   writing       are    clear      and    unambiguous,      its    meaning    is    to   be\n\nascertained in accordance with its plainly expressed intent.\"                              11\n\nSamuel Williston & Richard A. Lord, A Treatise on the Law of\n\nContracts      §    30:6    (4th      ed.    1993)(internal         citations    omitted).\n\nConstruing the SAA and POA together does nothing to shed additional\n\nlight upon an arbitration clause that is already pellucid.\n\n            We then turn to whether the POA can be read explicitly to\n\nincorporate by reference the SAA. CCI rests its assertion that the\n\n\n\n\n                                              -10-\n\fPOA incorporates the SAA on Paragraphs 2.2 and 16.3 of the POA.4\n\nBut it is not at all clear that these clauses operate to import the\n\nSAA    wholesale     into    the   POA.     It   appears    that   the   \"Contract\n\nDocuments\" identified in Paragraph 16.3 of the POA are only listed\n\nthere in order of supremacy to resolve disputes \"in the event of\n\nany inconsistency\" as to the work that is to be performed under the\n\nPOA.        It is true that Paragraph 16.3 of the POA lists the SAA as\n\none of the \"Contract Documents.\" However, the POA itself is listed\n\nas one of the Contract Documents, separately from the SAA--that\n\nalone       belies   CCI's   contention     that   the     arbitration   clause's\n\nspecific reference to the POA could be stretched to encompass\n\nclaims relating to the SAA as well.              Even if one considers the sum\n\nof the \"Contract Documents\" to equal the whole of the parties'\n\nagreement, the arbitration clause in Paragraph 14.1 of the POA\n\napplies specifically to disputes arising out of only one of those\n\n\n        4\n            Paragraph 2.2 states, in relevant part:\n               The Contract Documents, detailed in Paragraph 16.3\n               shall consist of the following, with the order of\n               supremacy beginning with the first described\n               document and ending with the last described\n               document within that paragraph.\n\nParagraph 16.3, labeled “Contract Documents,” lists the following:\n       a) The Strategic Alliance Agreement dated ____________\n          between CCI and Combined Energies.\n       b) This POA;\n       c) These POA Standard Terms and Conditions;\n       d) Combined Energies’ response to the Navy RFP as\n          referenced on the POA; and\n       e) Contract N62472-05-R-7510 dated 8/12/05 between the US\n          Navy and CCI Inc.\n\n\n                                          -11-\n\fdocuments: the POA.

Plaintiff-appellee Combined Energies (\"CE\") filed suit in Maine federal district court against Defendant-appellant CCI, Inc. (\"CCI\"), alleging various contract and tort claims related to what CE describes as a raid on CE's work-force <span class=\"star-pagination\">*170</span> subsequent to a failed take-over attempt by its erstwhile business partner CCI. CCI moved to stay the proceedings and compel arbitration. The district court denied the motion and, holding that CE's claims do not fall within the scope of the parties' arbitration agreement, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Background</h2>\n<p>CE is a Maine construction and energy services subcontractor. CCI is an Alaskan prime contractor. CE and CCI entered into a business relationship for the purposes of developing and performing projects for the U.S. Navy. The business relationship was formalized in three key agreements. The Teaming Agreement (\"TA\"), signed in late December 2004, established CCI as the prime contractor and CE as the subcontractor for a project proposal to be submitted to the U.S. Navy. The TA also contemplated other Navy contract opportunities. After the Navy accepted the proposal and awarded the contract to CCI, CCI and CE concluded a Strategic Alliance Agreement (\"SAA\") on August 23, 2005, a short document in which the parties stated their intention \"to strategically align themselves with one another in order to promote and utilize their respective expertise for the purpose of developing and performing projects. . . .\" That same day, the parties also entered into a Purchase Order Agreement (\"POA\") laying out the standard terms and conditions applicable to each party's performance of the Navy contract.</p>\n<p>It appears that the parties proceeded to perform as directed by the above triumvirate of agreements until their relationship broke down irretrievably in late 2006. CE alleges that CCI inquired about purchasing its business on October 15, 2006, an offer that CE declined. According to CE, CCI then set out to \"raid what it could not buy,\" by \"preventing CE from performing its obligations under existing contracts, preventing CE from obtaining new contracts, damaging CE's good reputation,\" and filching CE's entire workforce. CE was subject to a spate of mass resignations in early January 2007; the majority of the resignation letters, which are attached to CE's complaint, state that the sender had accepted or intended to accept a position with CCI.</p>\n<p>On February 1, 2007, CE filed suit against CCI in the United States District Court for the District of Maine, alleging tortious interference with its business; unjust enrichment; breach of the TA and SAA; breach of implied covenants including the duty of good faith and fair dealing; and defamation and slander per se. Arguing that an arbitration clause in the POA mandated the submission of CE's claims to arbitration, CCI timely moved to stay the proceedings and compel arbitration; CE opposed the motion. On March 14, 2007, the district court denied CCI's motion, Ending that it could not conclude that \"the arbitration clause in a construction contract encompasses a law suit alleging multiple violations of tort and contract law from the unsavory tactics CE claims CCI used in a bid to take-over its business.\"</p>\n<p>Pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act (\"FAA\"), this court has jurisdiction to review the district court's interlocutory order denying CCI's request for a stay and motion to compel arbitration. <i>See</i> 9 U.S.C. §§ 16(a)(1)(A), 16(a)(1)(B); <i>Campbell v. Gen. Dynamics Gov't Sys. Corp.,</i> 407 F.3d 546, 550 (1st Cir.2005).<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*171</span> II. Discussion</h2>\n<p>We are not now tasked with deciding upon the merits <i>vel non</i> of CE's claims against CCI, but rather upon their arbitrability. \"[A]rbitrability depends on contract interpretation, which is a question of law.\" <i>Keystone Shipping Co. v. New England Power Co.,</i> 109 F.3d 46, 50 (1st Cir.1997)(alteration in original)(quoting <i>PaineWebber Inc. v. Elahi,</i> 87 F.3d 589, 592 (1st Cir.1996))(internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, \"[w]e evaluate the district court's denial of a motion to compel arbitration de novo.\" <i>Kristian v. Comcast Corp.,</i> 446 F.3d 25, 31 (1st. Cir.2006)(citing <i>Campbell</i> 407 F.3d at 551).</p>\n<p>When deciding a motion to compel arbitration, a court must determine whether \"(i) there exists a written agreement to arbitrate, (ii) the dispute falls within the scope of that arbitration agreement, and (iii) the party seeking an arbitral forum has not waived its right to arbitration.\" <i>Bangor Hydro-Electric Co. v. New England Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,</i> 62 F.Supp.2d 152, 155 (D.Me.1999). Only, if all three prongs of the test are satisfied will a motion to compel arbitration be granted. Here, prongs (i) and (iii) are not at issue; the outcome of this case, therefore, turns entirely on whether the dispute is of a kind that the parties had agreed to submit to arbitration.</p>\n<p>Whether a claim falls within the reach of a particular arbitration clause is a question for the district court to determine initially as a matter of law. <i>See </i><i>Acevedo Maldonado v. PPG Indus., Inc.,</i> 514 F.2d 614, 616 (1st Cir.1975). Federal policy favors arbitration. <i>See </i><i>Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plymouth, Inc.,</i> 473 U.S. 614, 626, 105 S.Ct. 3346, 87 L.Ed.2d 444 (1985)(\"The Arbitration Act establishes that, as a matter of federal law, any doubts concerning the scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration. . . . \")(internal quotations omitted). However, \"arbitration is simply a matter of contract between the parties; it is a way to resolve disputesbut only those disputesthat the parties have agreed to submit to arbitration.\" <i>First Options of Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan,</i> 514 U.S. 938, 943, 115 S.Ct. 1920, 131 L.Ed.2d 985 (1995). CCI exhorts us that arbitration clauses must be construed liberally, while. CE cautions that it cannot be compelled to arbitrate claims that it did not consent to arbitrate. At bottom, however, federal policy merely \"guarantee[s] the enforcement of private contractual arrangements\" by creating \"a body of federal substantive law establishing and regulating the duty to honor an agreement to arbitrate.\" <i>Mitsubishi,</i> 473 U.S. at 625, 105 S.Ct. 3346 (internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p>Therefore, \"[w]hen deciding whether the parties agreed to arbitrate a certain matter . . ., courts generally . . . should apply ordinary state-law principles that govern the formation of contracts.\" <i>First Options,</i> 514 U.S. at 944, 115 S.Ct. 1920. Under Maine law, a contract</p>\n<blockquote>is to be construed in accordance with the intention of the parties, which is to be ascertained from an examination of the instrument as a whole. All parts and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*172</span> clauses must be considered together that it may be seen if and how far one clause is explained, modified, limited, or controlled by the others.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Peerless Ins. Co. v. Brennon,</i> 564 A.2d 383, 385 (Me.1989).</p>\n<p>In support of its argument that the parties' arbitration agreement requires arbitration of CE's claims, CCI relies on two clauses in the POA, which it contends must be read in tandem to mandate an expansive agreement to arbitrate all disputes between the parties. Paragraph 6.3 of the POA provides:</p>\n<blockquote>All unresolved claims, disputes, and other matters in question between [CCI] and [CE] not relating to claims included in Paragraph 6.2<sup>[2]</sup> shall be resolved in the manner provided in Article 14.</blockquote>\n<p>Paragraph 14.1, the relevant provision of Article 14, states:</p>\n<blockquote>All claims, disputes and matters in question arising out of, or relating to, this POA or the breach thereof shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p>Precedent may counsel us to construe arbitration clauses liberally, but it does not permit us to read out of an arbitration clause an explicit limit upon the scope of that clause that has been agreed to by both parties. Reading 6.3 and 14.1 together as Maine law requires produces not an expansive agreement to arbitrate but rather an arbitration clause clearly and on its face limited to \"[a]ll claims, disputes and matters in question <i>arising out of or relating to, this POA or the breach thereof</i>. . . .\" (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The key question remaining, then, is whether CE's claims arise out of, or relate to, the POA or breach of the POA. CE's contract-related claims reference the TA and the SAA, not the POA; however, it is true that CE cannot avoid arbitration by dint of artful pleading alone. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Acevedo Maldonado,</i> 514 F.2d at 616 (finding that arbitration clause covered \"contract-generated or contract-related disputes between the parties however labeled: it is immaterial whether claims are in contract or in tort\"); <i>Kiefer Specialty Flooring, Inc. v. Tarkett, Inc.,</i> 174 F.3d 907, 910 (7th Cir.1999)(noting that arbitrability of particular claim does not \"turn on the label`tort' or `contract'a party chose to affix to the claim\"). Nevertheless, we agree with the district court that the complaint filed by CE cannot be fairly said to arise out of, or relate to, the POA in the sense that would be necessary to confer arbitrability in this case. As the district court observed, \"[t]he Complaint does not claim any disputes between CCI and CE about the work CE performed under the POA, about payment in accordance with that work, about change orders, delay, quality of workmanship, or the myriad of other commonplace controversies between general contractors and subcontractors.\" <i>Combined Energies v. CCI, Inc.,</i> 484 F.Supp.2d 186, 189 (D.Me.2007). Indeed, as CE points out, CE existed as a business before entering into any sort of relationship with CCI and had operations apart from CCI; the gravamen of CE's allegationsthat CCI set upon a course of conduct that resulted in the destruction of CE's businessreverberate far beyond <span class=\"star-pagination\">*173</span> the POA and would stand regardless of the parties' rights and responsibilities as defined by that contract.</p>\n<p>CCI next argues that, at the very least, the allegations in CE's complaint that implicate the SAA must be submitted to arbitration because the SAA is incorporated into the POA and the two documents must be considered and construed as one contract.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>Crowe v. Bolduc,</i> 334 F.3d 124, 137 (1st. Cir.2003)(\"Under Maine law, in the absence of anything to indicate a contrary intention, instruments executed at the same time, by the same contracting parties, for the same purposes, and in the course of the same transaction will be considered and construed together, since they are, in the eyes of the law, one contract or instrument.\")(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p>CCI thus is making two conceptually distinct, although related, arguments to advocate applicability of the POA's arbitration clause to CE's SAA-related claims. <i>See </i><i>In re Olympic Mills Corp.,</i> 477 F.3d 1, 14 n. 11 (1st Cir.2007)(\"[The principle articulated in <i>Crowe</i>] is associated with but distinct from a court's consideration of a separate writing expressly incorporated by reference . . . <i>Compare</i> 11 Williston on Contracts § 30:25 (Writing Expressly Incorporated By Reference'), <i>with id.</i> § 30:26 (Writing Implicitly Incorporated By Reference').\"). Both are unavailing. In <i>Crowe,</i> we looked to two agreements executed on the same day to resolve a question of contractual ambiguity. Here, there is no comparable ambiguity. \"Where the words of a contract in writing are clear and unambiguous, its meaning is to be ascertained in accordance with its plainly expressed intent.\" 11 Samuel Williston &amp; Richard A. Lord, <i>A Treatise on the Law of Contracts</i> § 30:6 (4th ed. 1993)(internal citations omitted). Construing the SAA and POA together does nothing to shed additional light upon an arbitration clause that is already pellucid.</p>\n<p>We then turn to whether the POA can be read explicitly to incorporate by reference the SAA. CCI rests its assertion that the POA incorporates the SAA on Paragraphs 2.2 and 16.3 of the POA.<sup>[4]</sup> But it is not at all clear that these clauses operate to import the SAA wholesale into the POA. It appears that the \"Contract Documents\" identified in Paragraph 16.3 of the POA are only listed there in order of supremacy to resolve disputes \"in the event of any inconsistency\" as to the work that is to be performed under the POA. It is true that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*174</span> Paragraph 16.3 of the POA lists the SAA as one of the \"Contract Documents.\" However, the POA itself is listed as one of the Contract Documents, separately from the SAA-that alone belies CCI's contention that the arbitration clause's specific reference to the POA could be stretched to encompass claims relating to the SAA as well. Even if one considers the sum of the \"Contract Documents\" to equal the whole of the parties' agreement, the arbitration clause in Paragraph 14.1 of the POA applies specifically to disputes arising out of only one of those documents: the POA. It does not state that it applies to disputes arising out of all \"Contract Documents.\" Nowhere is it indicated that the term \"POA,\" as used in Paragraph 14.1, is shorthand for \"the POA and the SAA\" or for all the \"Contract Documents\" combined. If the parties had intended the arbitration clause to apply to their agreement writ large or to each of the \"Contract Documents\" individually, it would have been as easy to state that expressly.<sup>[5]</sup><i>See </i><i>Fit Tech, Inc. v. Bally Total Fitness,</i> 374 F.3d 1, 9-10 (1st Cir.2004)(rejecting argument that arbitration clause in one agreement applied to dispute arising out of another, related agreement even though former agreement was referenced in latter).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of CCI's motion to stay and compel arbitration.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The FAA provides that:\n</p>\n<p>A written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy there-after arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.</p>\n<p>9 U.S.C. § 2. The POA containing the arbitration clause at issue here is a contract in interstate commerce because it is an agreement between Alaskan and Maine corporations to perform work for the U.S. Navy; thus, this dispute is within the purview of the FAA.</p>\n<p>[2]  Paragraph 6.2 governs POA-related claims against the Navy. We see no need to recite it verbatim here as it is not particularly relevant to this case, although we do note that even that section lays out a dispute resolution procedure only for \"dispute[s] <i>arising under this POA</i>. . . .\" (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[3]  In its reply brief, CCI asserts that CE's response to this argument was cursory and should be deemed waived. <i>See </i><i>National Foreign Trade Council v. Natsios,</i> 181 F.3d 38, 61 n. 17 (1st Cir.1999)(\"[A]rguments raised only in a footnote or in a perfunctory manner are waived.\"). Merely because CE may have waived an argument regarding the incorporation of the SAA into the POA, howevera matter on which we take no viewit does not follow that CCI's argument automatically prevails. We may affirm the district court's order \"on any independent ground made manifest by the record.\" <i>Skirchak v. Dynamics Research Corp.,</i> 508 F.3d 49, 57 (1st Cir. 2007).</p>\n<p>[4]  Paragraph 2.2 states, in relevant part:\n</p>\n<p>The Contract Documents, detailed in Paragraph 16.3 shall consist of the following, with the order of supremacy beginning with the first described document and ending with the last described document within that paragraph.</p>\n<p>Paragraph 16.3, labeled \"Contract Documents,\" lists the following:</p>\n<p>a) The Strategic Alliance Agreement dated ________ between CCI and Combined Energies.</p>\n<p>b) This POA;</p>\n<p>c) These POA Standard Terms and Conditions;</p>\n<p>d) Combined Energies' response to the Navy RFP as referenced on the POA; and</p>\n<p>e) Contract N62472-05-R-7510 dated 8/12/05 between the U.S. Navy and CCI Inc.</p>\n<p>[5]  Since we find that the arbitration clause does not reach claims related to the SAA, we find it unnecessary to consider the question whether any of CE's claims would be within the scope of a clause that did extend to SAA-related claims.</p>\n\n</div>",

Under Maine law, a contract</p>\n<blockquote>is to be construed in accordance with the intention of the parties, which is to be ascertained from an examination of the instrument as a whole. All parts and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*172</span> clauses must be considered together that it may be seen if and how far one clause is explained, modified, limited, or controlled by the others.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Peerless Ins. Co. v. Brennon,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">564</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">383</span></span>, 385 (Me.1989).</p>\n<p>In support of its argument that the parties' arbitration agreement requires arbitration of CE's claims, CCI relies on two clauses in the POA, which it contends must be read in tandem to mandate an expansive agreement to arbitrate all disputes between the parties. Paragraph 6.3 of the POA provides:</p>\n<blockquote>All unresolved claims, disputes, and other matters in question between [CCI] and [CE] not relating to claims included in Paragraph 6.2<sup>[2]</sup> shall be resolved in the manner provided in Article 14.</blockquote>\n<p>Paragraph 14.1, the relevant provision of Article 14, states:</p>\n<blockquote>All claims, disputes and matters in question arising out of, or relating to, this POA or the breach thereof shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect unless the parties mutually agree otherwise.</blockquote>\n<p>Precedent may counsel us to construe arbitration clauses liberally, but it does not permit us to read out of an arbitration clause an explicit limit upon the scope of that clause that has been agreed to by both parties. Reading 6.3 and 14.1 together as Maine law requires produces not an expansive agreement to arbitrate but rather an arbitration clause clearly and on its face limited to \"[a]ll claims, disputes and matters in question <i>arising out of or relating to, this POA or the breach thereof</i>. . . .\" (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>The key question remaining, then, is whether CE's claims arise out of, or relate to, the POA or breach of the POA. CE's contract-related claims reference the TA and the SAA, not the POA; however, it is true that CE cannot avoid arbitration by dint of artful pleading alone. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Acevedo Maldonado,</i> 514 F.2d at 616 (finding that arbitration clause covered \"contract-generated or contract-related disputes between the parties however labeled: it is immaterial whether claims are in contract or in tort\"); <i>Kiefer Specialty Flooring, Inc. v. Tarkett, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"763515\"><a href=\"/opinion/763515/kiefer-specialty-flooring-inc-v-tarkett-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">907</span></a></span>, 910 (7th Cir.1999)(noting that arbitrability of particular claim does not \"turn on the label`tort' or `contract'a party chose to affix to the claim\"). Nevertheless, we agree with the district court that the complaint filed by CE cannot be fairly said to arise out of, or relate to, the POA in the sense that would be necessary to confer arbitrability in this case. As the district court observed, \"[t]he Complaint does not claim any disputes between CCI and CE about the work CE performed under the POA, about payment in accordance with that work, about change orders, delay, quality of workmanship, or the myriad of other commonplace controversies between general contractors and subcontractors.\" <i>Combined Energies v. CCI, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2445338\"><a href=\"/opinion/2445338/combined-energies-v-cci-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">186</span></a></span>, 189 (D.Me.2007). Indeed, as CE points out, CE existed as a business before entering into any sort of relationship with CCI and had operations apart from CCI; the gravamen of CE's allegationsthat CCI set upon a course of conduct that resulted in the destruction of CE's businessreverberate far beyond <span class=\"star-pagination\">*173</span> the POA and would stand regardless of the parties' rights and responsibilities as defined by that contract.</p>\n<p>CCI next argues that, at the very least, the allegations in CE's complaint that implicate the SAA must be submitted to arbitration because the SAA is incorporated into the POA and the two documents must be considered and construed as one contract.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>Crowe v. Bolduc,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200534\"><a href=\"/opinion/200534/crowe-v-bolduc/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">124</span></a></span>, 137 (1st. Cir.2003)(\"Under Maine law, in the absence of anything to indicate a contrary intention, instruments executed at the same time, by the same contracting parties, for the same purposes, and in the course of the same transaction will be considered and construed together, since they are, in the eyes of the law, one contract or instrument.\")(internal quotations omitted).</p>\n<p>CCI thus is making two conceptually distinct, although related, arguments to advocate applicability of the POA's arbitration clause to CE's SAA-related claims. <i>See </i><i>In re Olympic Mills Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202596\"><a href=\"/opinion/202596/siaca-v-dcc-operating-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">477</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 14 n. 11 (1st Cir.2007)(\"[The principle articulated in <i>Crowe</i>] is associated with but distinct from a court's consideration of a separate writing expressly incorporated by reference . . . <i>Compare</i> 11 Williston on Contracts § 30:25 (Writing Expressly Incorporated By Reference'), <i>with id.</i> § 30:26 (Writing Implicitly Incorporated By Reference').\"). Both are unavailing. In <i>Crowe,</i> we looked to two agreements executed on the same day to resolve a question of contractual ambiguity. Here, there is no comparable ambiguity. \"Where the words of a contract in writing are clear and unambiguous, its meaning is to be ascertained in accordance with its plainly expressed intent.\" 11 Samuel Williston &amp; Richard A. Lord, <i>A Treatise on the Law of Contracts</i> § 30:6 (4th ed. 1993)(internal citations omitted). Construing the SAA and POA together does nothing to shed additional light upon an arbitration clause that is already pellucid.</p>\n<p>We then turn to whether the POA can be read explicitly to incorporate by reference the SAA. CCI rests its assertion that the POA incorporates the SAA on Paragraphs 2.2 and 16.3 of the POA.<sup>[4]</sup> But it is not at all clear that these clauses operate to import the SAA wholesale into the POA. It appears that the \"Contract Documents\" identified in Paragraph 16.3 of the POA are only listed there in order of supremacy to resolve disputes \"in the event of any inconsistency\" as to the work that is to be performed under the POA. It is true that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*174</span> Paragraph 16.3 of the POA lists the SAA as one of the \"Contract Documents.\" However, the POA itself is listed as one of the Contract Documents, separately from the SAA-that alone belies CCI's contention that the arbitration clause's specific reference to the POA could be stretched to encompass claims relating to the SAA as well. Even if one considers the sum of the \"Contract Documents\" to equal the whole of the parties' agreement, the arbitration clause in Paragraph 14.1 of the POA applies specifically to disputes arising out of only one of those documents: the POA. It does not state that it applies to disputes arising out of all \"Contract Documents.\" Nowhere is it indicated that the term \"POA,\" as used in Paragraph 14.1, is shorthand for \"the POA and the SAA\" or for all the \"Contract Documents\" combined. If the parties had intended the arbitration clause to apply to their agreement writ large or to each of the \"Contract Documents\" individually, it would have been as easy to state that expressly.<sup>[5]</sup><i>See </i><i>Fit Tech, Inc. v. Bally Total Fitness,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201103\"><a href=\"/opinion/201103/fit-tech-inc-v-bally-total-fitness/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9-10 (1st Cir.2004)(rejecting argument that arbitration clause in one agreement applied to dispute arising out of another, related agreement even though former agreement was referenced in latter).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. Conclusion</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's denial of CCI's motion to stay and compel arbitration.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The FAA provides that:\n</p>\n<p>A written provision in . . . a contract evidencing a transaction involving commerce to settle by arbitration a controversy there-after arising out of such contract or transaction, or the refusal to perform the whole or any part thereof, or an agreement in writing to submit to arbitration an existing controversy arising out of such a contract, transaction, or refusal, shall be valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.</p>\n<p>9 U.S.C. § 2. The POA containing the arbitration clause at issue here is a contract in interstate commerce because it is an agreement between Alaskan and Maine corporations to perform work for the U.S. Navy; thus, this dispute is within the purview of the FAA.</p>\n<p>[2]  Paragraph 6.2 governs POA-related claims against the Navy. We see no need to recite it verbatim here as it is not particularly relevant to this case, although we do note that even that section lays out a dispute resolution procedure only for \"dispute[s] <i>arising under this POA</i>. . . .\" (emphasis added).</p>\n<p>[3]  In its reply brief, CCI asserts that CE's response to this argument was cursory and should be deemed waived. <i>See </i><i>National Foreign Trade Council v. Natsios,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198529\"><a href=\"/opinion/198529/national-foreign-v-natsios/\"><span class=\"volume\">181</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">38</span></a></span>, 61 n. 17 (1st Cir.1999)(\"[A]rguments raised only in a footnote or in a perfunctory manner are waived.\"). Merely because CE may have waived an argument regarding the incorporation of the SAA into the POA, howevera matter on which we take no viewit does not follow that CCI's argument automatically prevails. We may affirm the district court's order \"on any independent ground made manifest by the record.\" <i>Skirchak v.
