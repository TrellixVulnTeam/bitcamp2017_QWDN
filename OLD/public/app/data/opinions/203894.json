Gustavo A. Gelpí, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n                Torruella, Howard, Circuit Judges,\n                  and DiClerico,* District Judge.\n\n\n     Antonio J.

Antonetti-Stutts, Solicitor General, were on brief\nfor appellees.\n\n\n                           June 30, 2009\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge. This difficult appeal concerns\n\nconstitutional challenges to amendments to Puerto Rico's Compulsory\n\nMotor Vehicle Liability Insurance Act, Act No. 253 (\"Law 253\").\n\n            Law 253 requires Puerto Rican motor vehicle owners to pay\n\nan annual premium for compulsory car insurance at the time of\n\nacquisition or renewal of vehicle registration.             The premiums,\n\ninitially    collected   by   the   Secretary   of    the   Treasury   (the\n\n\"Secretary\"), are transferred to the Compulsory Liability Joint\n\nUnderwriting Association of Puerto Rico (\"JUA\"), a Commonwealth-\n\ncreated association of all private insurers in Puerto Rico.             JUA\n\nthen provides the compulsory car insurance.\n\n            Motor vehicle owners can opt out of the compulsory\n\nliability insurance scheme by privately purchasing insurance with\n\nthe same or comparable coverage.          Those owners who opt out can\n\neither avoid paying the uniform premium at vehicle registration or\n\nseek reimbursement of the \"duplicate premium\" paid.\n\n            The amendments at issue in this appeal, Law 230 and Law\n\n414, concern the duplicate premiums collected by JUA.          In essence,\n\nthe amendments mandate the transfer of funds designated by JUA for\n\nthe reimbursement of duplicate premiums (plus the interest they\n\ngenerate) back to the Secretary for use by the Commonwealth to\n\naddress   budget   shortfalls.      Moreover,   Law   230   promulgates   a\n\nseparate procedure, Procedure No. 96, to provide reimbursement.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f           In 2002, the plaintiffs-appellants (the \"Plaintiffs\"),\n\nall owners of motor vehicles in Puerto Rico who privately purchased\n\ncar insurance but paid duplicate premiums, filed suit against the\n\nSecretary and the Governor of the Commonwealth (the \"Governor\" and,\n\ntogether with the Secretary, the \"Defendants\") in their official\n\nand personal capacities.1      Plaintiffs claim that Law 230 and Law\n\n414 violate the Takings, Due Process, and Equal Protection Clauses.\n\nThey   sought   declaratory    relief,     preliminary    and    permanent\n\ninjunctive   relief,   reimbursement,      compensatory    damages,   and\n\ncertification of a class of similarly situated vehicle owners. The\n\ndistrict   court   denied   almost   all   relief   requested,   including\n\nPlaintiffs' request for class certification. However, the district\n\ncourt granted a preliminary injunction, later made permanent,\n\nenjoining the transfer of the interest generated by the duplicate\n\npremiums and ordering the Commonwealth to develop an adequate\n\nscheme of reimbursement of that interest.           This appeal followed.\n\nAfter careful consideration, we affirm-in-part, reverse-in-part,\n\nand remand for further proceedings.\n\n                              I. Background\n\n           Our discussion of Law 253 and the amendments at issue in\n\nthis appeal draw from, and incorporate by reference, our prior\n\n\n1\n   At the time of the filing of this action, Juan Antonio Flores-\nGalarza was Secretary and Sila María Calderón was Governor,\nalthough they no longer hold those positions. Because they were\nsued in their personal capacities, they remain parties to this\naction.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fdecisions concerning Law 253.           See Asociación de Subscripción\n\nConjunta   del   Seguro    de   Responsibilidad     Obligatorio    v.   Flores\n\nGalarza, 484 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2007); Arroyo-Melecio v. Puerto Rican\n\nAm. Ins. Co., 398 F.3d 56 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           A.    Law 253\n\n           Law 253, codified at P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 8051-61,\n\nrequires liability insurance coverage for all registered motor\n\nvehicles in Puerto Rico \"that travel on public thoroughfares.\"\n\nFlores Galarza, 484 F.3d at 6.        To that end, Law 253 provides for\n\ncompulsory   liability     insurance,      \"'with   $3000   of   coverage   for\n\ndamages caused to third parties per accident in exchange for a\n\nuniform premium, initially set at $99 for each private passenger\n\nvehicle and $148 for each commercial vehicle.'\"                  Id. (quoting\n\nArroyo-Melecio, 398 F.3d at 60-61).             The compulsory liability\n\ninsurance is provided by JUA, \"an association of all private\n\ninsurers in Puerto Rico.\"          Id. at 7.        JUA must provide this\n\ncoverage to all drivers, even high risk ones, with \"'the risk of\n\ninsuring these high-risk drivers . . . spread among all of the\n\nprivate insurers.'\"       Id. (quoting Arroyo-Melecio, 398 F.3d at 62).\n\n           To fund the compulsory liability insurance, Law 253\n\nrequires motor vehicle owners to pay the uniform premium annually\n\nto the Secretary at the time of acquisition or renewal of vehicle\n\nregistration.     Id. (citing Arroyo-Melecio, 398 F.3d at 61 n.2).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fThe Secretary then transfers the premiums periodically to JUA. Id.\n\n(citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 8055(c)).\n\n            Motor vehicle owners can \"opt out of the compulsory\n\nliability   insurance   scheme   by   privately   purchasing   liability\n\ninsurance with comparable or better coverage.\"           See id. at 7\n\n(citing Arroyo-Melecio, 398 F.3d at 61 n.2).         Although, in some\n\ncircumstances, individual motor vehicle owners who opt out can\n\n\"avoid paying the compulsory insurance premium to the Secretary\" at\n\nthe time of registration, see id. at 7 n.2, a number of such\n\nvehicle owners still pay the compulsory insurance premium.2          For\n\nthose owners, Law 253 provides for reimbursement; in particular,\n\nvehicle owners \"may then seek reimbursement directly from the JUA\n\nor from his insurer, who will, in turn, seek reimbursement from the\n\nJUA.\"   Id. at 7.   These procedures are not at issue in this appeal.\n\n\n\n2\n   Specifically, individuals who have \"the requisite amount of\ntraditional liability insurance\" can \"avoid paying the compulsory\ninsurance premium to the Secretary\" by presenting a \"Certificate of\nCompliance\" from their insurer. Id. at 7 n.2.\n\n      As noted in Flores Galarza, it is unclear whether all\nindividuals who opt out by privately purchasing insurance can avoid\npaying the compulsory insurance premium at vehicle registration.\nThat is because Puerto Rico law defines \"[t]raditional liability\ninsurance\" as \"insurance protecting against both personal and\nproperty damage 'resulting from or incident to ownership,\nmaintenance, or use of any . . . vehicle.\" Id. (citing Law 253 and\nP.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 407(1)). Accordingly, those who buy less\nthan \"traditional liability insurance,\" but insurance sufficient to\nopt out of the compulsory insurance scheme, do not appear to be\nable to avoid paying the compulsory insurance premium at\nregistration. We so concluded in Flores Galarza, see id. at 7 n.3,\nalthough we do not need to address the issue here.\n\n                                  -5-\n\f          \"Because a portion of the total amount of premiums\n\nreceived by JUA may be owed to third parties who seek refunds for\n\nduplicate payments,\" JUA is required by law to \"set aside these\n\npremiums and accumulate them in a separate reserve account (the\n\n\"Reserve\").\"   Id. at 8.     However, since January 1, 1998, the\n\neffective date of Law 253, JUA \"has been unable to determine\n\nexactly how many registered motor vehicles in Puerto Rico are\n\ncovered by private liability insurance.\"   Id.   As a result, JUA has\n\ndivided the Reserve account between the \"duplicate premiums\" it\n\nestimates it is required to reimburse to motor vehicle owners, and\n\nan \"overstated\" amount of funds, which are funds set aside by JUA\n\nas a buffer to meet all requests for reimbursement.    See id. at 8-\n\n9.3\n\n          The general provisions of Puerto Rico insurance law with\n\nrespect to \"unclaimed funds\" apply to Law 253.      See id. at 8 n.5\n\n(\"Puerto Rico's Insurance Code makes clear that this general\n\nprovision applies to the compulsory liability insurance system\n\nunder Law 253.\" (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 2612)).      Under\n\nPuerto Rico insurance law, vehicle owners have seven years to claim\n\na duplicate premium.   See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 2603; see also\n\n\n\n3\n   In Flores Galarza JUA represented that from 1998 to 2001 it\nestimated that 25% \"of all vehicles were covered by policies from\nprivate insurers, and, accordingly, set aside 25% of all premiums\nreceived\" in the Reserve. See id. at 8. For fiscal year 2001, it\nreduced the amount reserved to approximately 17%. Id. at 8-9. But\nsee id. at 11 n.13 (noting discrepancy in percentages withheld).\n\n                                -6-\n\fFlores Galarza, 484 F.3d at 10 n.9.      Otherwise, the duplicate\n\npremium escheats to the Commonwealth.\n\n          B.   Law 230 and Law 414\n\n          On September 11, 2002, the Puerto Rican legislature\n\nenacted Law 230, codified at P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 8055(l).\n\nLaw 230 requires JUA to retransfer to the Secretary all funds held\n\nin the Reserve every two years to balance the Commonwealth's\n\nbudget.   The first transfer mandated under Law 230, $73 million,\n\noccurred the same month of Law 230's enactment.4      Law 230 also\n\nprovided that the Commonwealth could spend $53 million of the funds\n\nimmediately.    The $53 million, according to the Statement of\n\nMotives of the subsequently enacted Law 414, corresponded to the\n\noverstated funds contained in the Reserve.5\n\n          Under Law 230, the remaining $20 million, an estimate of\n\nthe actual duplicate premiums paid, remained in the custody of the\n\nSecretary as trustee for five years, after which all unclaimed\n\n\n\n4\n   In fact, the $73 million was never transferred to JUA in the\nfirst place.    As discussed in more detail in Flores Galarza,\nbeginning in 2002, the Secretary refused to transfer the premiums\nit collected to JUA, a practice that ended when the parties reached\na settlement in November 2002. 484 F.3d at 9-10. Pursuant to the\nsettlement, the Secretary transferred to JUA all but $73 million,\nwhich was the amount Law 230 required JUA to retransfer back to the\nSecretary. See generally id. at 9-10.\n5\n  This conflicts with Flores Galarza, where the overstated amount\nwas estimated to be between $8 million and $10 million. See id. at\n8, 11 n.13.      The parties provide no explanation for this\ndiscrepancy, although Plaintiffs contend that the $8 million to $10\nmillion amount is the correct one.\n\n                                -7-\n\fduplicate   premiums    became   the   property   of    the   Commonwealth.\n\nHowever, any income generated by the funds, such as interest,\n\nreverted to the Commonwealth's General Fund as it accrued.\n\n            Accordingly,    under   Law   230,   \"the   seven-year     period\n\nprovided by the general provisions of Puerto Rico's Insurance Code\n\n. . . [is divided] among the JUA (which holds the funds for two\n\nyears) and the Secretary (who holds the funds for five additional\n\nyears), after which time the funds lapse to the general fund.\"\n\nFlores Galarza, 484 F.3d at 10 n.9.\n\n            Pursuant to Law 230, the Secretary adopted Procedure No.\n\n96,   a   procedure    by   which   motor   vehicle     owners   can     seek\n\nreimbursement from the Secretary.           To obtain reimbursement, a\n\nvehicle owner must fill out a model form and submit, via mail or at\n\ncertain designated offices, the following:\n\n            a.   Copy of the Motor Vehicle Registration\n            License for which such reimbursement is being\n            claimed;\n\n            b. Copy of the insurance policy. Said policy\n            shall be for each year that is being claimed;\n\n            c. In the case such that it is the insurance\n            firm which is making the claim, it shall\n            attach certified copies of those policies that\n            it is claiming;\n\n            d. Certification of payment of the policy for\n            each year being claimed. Such certification\n            shall be issued by the insurance firm;\n\n            e. Certification that such insurance firm has\n            not received any reimbursement from [JUA], nor\n            has reimbursed the premium for the Mandatory\n            Liability Insurance, to the insured party.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fAccording to the Statement of Motives of Law 414, the Secretary has\n\nonly reimbursed approximately $500,000 of duplicate premiums in the\n\nfirst two years of the enactment of Law 230.\n\n          On September 22, 2004, the legislature passed Law 414,\n\nalso codified at P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 8055(1).      Among other\n\nthings, Law 414 permitted the Commonwealth to use $19 million of\n\nthe remaining funds transferred in September 2002 to balance the\n\n2004-05 fiscal year budget. Law 414 also requires the Commonwealth\n\nto use money from the General Fund and the Budgetary Fund to\n\nreimburse vehicle owners if the amount transferred by JUA every two\n\nyears is not sufficient to satisfy reimbursement requests.\n\n          C.   Procedural History\n\n          Plaintiffs   are   motor   vehicle   owners   who   privately\n\npurchased liability insurance but also paid duplicate premiums. On\n\nFebruary 6, 2002, in anticipation of the passage of Law 230,\n\nPlaintiffs filed a complaint in district court seeking equitable\n\nrelief and damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.      Plaintiffs refuse to\n\nseek reimbursement from the Secretary through Procedure No. 96.6\n\n\n6\n   In 2001, Plaintiffs filed a class action in the Commonwealth\nCourt of First Instance seeking reimbursement from JUA. The action\nwas dismissed for lack of primary jurisdiction, and on June 11,\n2008, the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal. See\nGarcía-Rubiera v. Asociación de Subscripción Conjunta del Seguro de\nResponsibilidad Obligatorio, No. KLAN200700327 (P.R. Cir. Jun. 11,\n2008) (translation provided by the parties). In its decision the\nCourt of Appeals held that Law 230 placed exclusive primary\njurisdiction for any claims for reimbursement with the Secretary.\nThus, Plaintiffs' failure to utilize Procedure No. 96 deprived the\nCourt of First Instance jurisdiction to address their claims. See\n\n                                 -9-\n\f             In their complaint, which has been amended,7 Plaintiffs\n\nassert a property interest in the duplicate premiums and the\n\ninterest they generate. Consequently, Plaintiffs contend that each\n\ntransfer of the funds from the Reserve account to the Secretary,\n\nstarting with the $73 million in September of 2002, constitutes a\n\ntemporary     physical   appropriation   of   their   property   without\n\ncompensation and without due process, in violation of the Fifth and\n\nFourteenth Amendments.       They also contend that the Secretary\n\npermanently, and unlawfully, appropriated the interest generated by\n\nthe funds.    Finally, they contend that, as payers of the duplicate\n\npremiums, they and others similarly situated were singled out by\n\nthe Commonwealth to address its budget concerns, in violation of\n\nthe Equal Protection Clause.\n\n             Plaintiffs sought\n\n1.           a declaratory judgment that        the   Governor   \"cannot\n             implement\" Laws 230 and 414;\n\n2.           a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent the\n             transfer of funds from the Reserve to the Secretary;\n\n\n\n\nid. slip. op. at 16-19. The Court of Appeals did not address the\nmerits of Plaintiffs' constitutional claims. Id. slip op. at 21.\n7\n   Plaintiffs amended the complaint on December 24, 2004 after the\ndistrict court dismissed the original complaint without prejudice\non February 9, 2004. The district court dismissed the complaint on\nstanding and ripeness grounds.    In essence, the district court\nfound that Plaintiffs' claims were premature because \"it was\nuncertain\" that Law 230, then known as Bill 2114, would pass \"and\nthe Commonwealth will in fact appropriate the funds for the 2002-\n2003 budget.\"\n\n                                  -10-\n\f3.         $70 million in damages from the Secretary                and   the\n           Governor in their personal capacities; and\n\n4.         costs and attorneys' fees.8\n\nPlaintiffs also sought to certify a class.           The Governor and the\n\nSecretary each moved to dismiss the claims, claiming, among other\n\nthings,   qualified   immunity.      Plaintiffs      opposed,    and   moved\n\nseparately for a preliminary injunction and class certification.\n\n           On August 30, 2007, the district court issued an opinion\n\nand order that addressed these various motions.            García-Rubiera v.\n\nFlores-Galarza, 516 F. Supp. 2d 180 (D.P.R. 2007).            In the order,\n\nthe district court dismissed as unripe the takings claim with\n\nrespect to the duplicate premiums, since Plaintiffs had not availed\n\nthemselves of their administrative remedy under Procedure No. 96.\n\nId. at 188-90. The order also dismissed Plaintiffs' damages claims\n\nagainst   the   Secretary   and   the    Treasurer    in    their   personal\n\ncapacities, finding that both were entitled to qualified immunity.\n\nId. at 194-95.     The district court further denied preliminary\n\ninjunctive relief that would have prevented the Commonwealth from\n\ntaking title to those duplicate premiums transferred in September\n\n2002, which were scheduled to escheat to the Commonwealth in\n\nSeptember 2007.    Id. at 195-96.       The district court also denied\n\nPlaintiffs' motion for class certification.          Id. at 198.    However,\n\n\n8\n     Plaintiffs also seek reimbursement, but any claim for\nreimbursement against Defendants in their official capacities, to\nthe extent that it is a claim for damages, is barred by the\nEleventh Amendment. See Flores Galarza, 484 F.3d at 23-25 & n.27.\n\n                                  -11-\n\fthe   district      court   granted     a    preliminary          injunction,         made\n\npermanent,    that    enjoined   Defendants            from    depositing      into   the\n\nGeneral Fund any interest generated by the duplicate premiums. Id.\n\nat 196-98 & n.20.\n\n           The district court later entered a separate judgment\n\nsetting forth the terms of the permanent injunction, whereby it\n\nretained     jurisdiction     until     the       Commonwealth           instituted     a\n\nconstitutionally      adequate   scheme          \"to    deal    with     the   interest\n\ngenerated by the Duplicate Premiums.\"                     It further stated that\n\n\"[j]udgment is also entered dismissing all claims against [the\n\nSecretary]    and    [the   Governor]       in    their       personal    capacities.\"\n\nPlaintiffs now appeal.\n\n                              II.     Discussion\n\n           Plaintiffs raise several issues on appeal.                       We discuss\n\neach in turn.\n\n           A.    The Takings Claim\n\n           Plaintiffs first argue that the district court erred by\n\ndismissing their Takings Clause claim with respect to the duplicate\n\npremiums as unripe because of Plaintiffs' refusal to pursue their\n\nadministrative remedy under Procedure No. 96. As discussed in more\n\ndetail below, we disagree with the district court and conclude that\n\nPlaintiffs' takings claim for declaratory and injunctive relief is\n\nripe despite their failure to utilize Procedure No. 96.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\f            We review de novo the dismissal of a takings claim on\n\nripeness grounds. Deniz v. Municipality of Guaynabo, 285 F.3d 142,\n\n145 (1st Cir. 2002).     To assert a ripe takings claim, a plaintiff\n\nmust   satisfy   \"'two   independent   procedural   hurdles.'\"     Flores\n\nGalarza, 484 F.3d at 13 (quoting Suitum v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning\n\nAgency, 520 U.S. 725, 733-34 (1997)).      As explained by the Supreme\n\nCourt in Williamson County Reg'l Planning Commission v. Hamilton\n\nBank, 473 U.S. 172 (1985), a plaintiff asserting a takings claim\n\nmust demonstrate that (1) he or she \"received a final decision from\n\nthe state on the use of his property,\" and (2) \"sought compensation\n\nthrough the procedures the State has provided for doing so.\"          See\n\nFlores Galarza, 484 F.3d at 13-14 (quoting Williamson County, 473\n\nU.S.   at   194).    Plaintiffs   have   the   burden   of   demonstrating\n\nripeness.    See Pascoag Reservoir & Dam, LLC v. Rhode Island, 337\n\nF.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir. 2003) (holding that \"[a] federal suit is not\n\ntimely until a plaintiff demonstrates\" ripeness (emphasis added)).\n\n                    1.   The Finality Prong\n\n            Plaintiffs satisfy the first, finality prong.          First,\n\nPlaintiffs have a sufficient property interest in the duplicate\n\npremiums to support their takings claim.            For purposes of the\n\nTakings Clause, \"the existence of a property interest is determined\n\nby reference to 'existing rules or understandings that stem from an\n\nindependent source such as state law.'\"          See Phillips v. Wash.\n\nLegal Found., 524 U.S. 156, 164 (1998) (quoting Bd. of Regents of\n\n\n                                  -13-\n\fState Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577 (1972)).         Here, Puerto Rico\n\nlaw plainly establishes that Plaintiffs have a sufficient property\n\ninterest in the duplicate premiums.             By regulation, JUA must\n\nsegregate those premiums collected that are thought to be duplicate\n\npremiums, and Puerto Rico's insurance law concerning \"unclaimed\n\nfunds\" apply to the duplicate premiums collected.                See Flores\n\nGalarza, 484 F.3d at 8 & n.5.        Furthermore, upon transfer to the\n\nSecretary, Law 230 requires the Secretary to hold the duplicate\n\npremiums in a fiduciary capacity.          See P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§\n\n8055(1) (\"The Secretary of the Treasury shall retain these funds as\n\ntrustee . . . .\") (emphasis added).        Finally, Law 253, Law 230, and\n\nLaw 414 all provide for reimbursement of the duplicate premiums.\n\nThus,   like   funds   held   in   trust   in   an   IOLTA   account   or   an\n\ninterpleader account, the funds held by JUA or the Secretary are\n\nclearly the \"private property\" of Plaintiffs for purposes of the\n\nTakings Clause.    See Phillips, 524 U.S. at 164 (\"All agree that\n\nunder Texas law the principal held in IOLTA trust accounts is the\n\n'private property' of the client.\"); see also Webb's Fabulous\n\nPharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 161 (1980) (holding\n\nthat funds deposited in interpleader fund for benefit of creditors\n\nare the property of creditors); cf. Flores Galarza, 484 F.3d at 30\n\n(finding that the duplicate premiums \"'constitute a double payment\n\nfor the same insurance,' and, therefore, do not belong to JUA, but\n\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\frather belong to private insured motorists.\") (quotations omitted\n\nand emphasis added).9\n\n            Second, the Secretary's appropriation of the duplicate\n\npremiums    constitutes    a   \"final    decision\"    for    purposes   of    the\n\nfinality prong.      \"[T]he finality requirement is concerned with\n\nwhether the initial decisionmaker has arrived at a definitive\n\nposition on the issue that inflicts an actual, concrete injury.\"\n\nId. at 15 n.18 (quoting Williamson County, 473 U.S. at 193)\n\n(emphasis added).     As we stated in Flores Galarza,\n\n            The case law addressing the first \"hurdle\"\n            focuses on whether the administrative body\n            responsible   for   applying  the   challenged\n            regulations has completed discretionary review\n            of the plaintiff's particular situation.\n            Here, there is no pending administrative\n            process that could, through a variance, waiver\n            or other discretionary decision, modify the\n            statute's impact on the JUA.\n\nId. at 15.    The same is true here, as there is no pending process\n\nthat would \"modify the statute's impact\" on Plaintiffs.\n\n                    2.    The Just Compensation Prong\n\n            Consequently,      at   issue     is   whether   Plaintiffs      have\n\nsatisfied    the   second,     \"just    compensation\"    prong.     The      just\n\n\n\n9\n   We further note that Defendants do not appeal the injunction\nentered by the district court with respect to the interest\ngenerated by the duplicate premiums.          Since the basis of\nPlaintiffs' property interest in the interest is based on the maxim\nthat \"'interest follows principal,'\" see Flores Galarza, 484 F.3d\nat 32 (quoting Phillips, 524 U.S. at 165-72), it would be anomalous\nif Plaintiffs have a property interest in the interest generated by\nthe duplicate premiums but not the premiums themselves.\n\n                                       -15-\n\fcompensation prong presents some difficulty for Plaintiffs, since\n\nProcedure No. 96 provides a procedure to reimburse the duplicate\n\npremiums, and Plaintiffs refuse to avail themselves of it.                  By\n\ntheir own admission, Plaintiffs have not \"sought compensation\n\nthrough the procedures the State has provided for doing so.\"               Id.\n\nat 14 (citations omitted); see also Williamson County, 473 U.S. at\n\n197 (holding that the takings claim in that case was unripe \"until\n\n[the plaintiff] has utilized th[e] procedure\" for just compensation\n\nprovided by the state).            For that reason, the district court\n\ndismissed Plaintiffs' claim as unripe.           See García-Rubiera, 516 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 190.\n\n          However,    we    have    recognized    exceptions   to   the   just\n\ncompensation prong.        We have noted that facial challenges to a\n\nregulation \"are generally ripe the moment the challenged regulation\n\nor ordinance is passed.\"      Flores Galarza, 484 F.3d at 14 (quoting\n\nSuitum, 520 U.S. at 736 n.10).           Moreover, we have held that a\n\nplaintiff is relieved of the second prong if the procedure is\n\n\"unavailable,\" \"inadequate,\" or \"futile.\"            See id. (noting that\n\nsecond prong does not apply when a procedure is \"unavailable or\n\ninadequate\" (quoting Williamson County, 473 U.S. at 197)); see also\n\nPascoag, 337 F.3d at 92-93 (noting that futility is an exception to\n\nthis prong).   Finally, we noted in Flores Galarza that the just\n\ncompensation prong may not apply in certain circumstances to a\n\n\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f\"taking that involves the direct appropriation of funds.\"          See 484\n\nF.3d at 19.\n\n          On appeal, Plaintiffs argue that all three categories of\n\nexceptions apply.10 We agree as to the third category, and conclude\n\nthat Plaintiffs' claim for declaratory and injunctive relief is\n\nripe because their claim \"involves the direct appropriation of\n\nfunds.\"\n\n          In Flores Galarza, we noted that the Supreme Court\n\nexpressed doubt that a federal takings claim seeking declaratory\n\nand injunctive relief would require individuals to first seek\n\ncompensation under the Tucker Act, which is \"usually . . . a\n\npreliminary    step   in   a   takings    action   against   the   federal\n\ngovernment.\"   Id. (citing the plurality opinion in Eastern Enters.\n\nv. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498 (1998)).     Apfel concerned a challenge to the\n\nCoal Act, \"which established a mechanism for funding health care\n\nbenefits for coal industry retirees,\" and which required private\n\ncoal operators \"to contribute to the payment of premiums to fund\n\nsuch benefits.\"   Id. (citing Apfel, 524 U.S. at 504).       Eastern, one\n\nsuch private coal operator, brought both facial and as-applied\n\n\n10\n   It is unclear whether Plaintiffs limit their takings challenge\nto solely a facial challenge. Plaintiffs' takings claim is not\nwell-presented, and at times in their brief suggest such a\nlimitation while, at the same time, they state that they are\nentitled to \"go to trial and present evidence that the procedure's\nnet effect would have been to deprive the substantial majority of\nthe owners of their reimbursement.\" Given this lack of clarity, we\nconstrue Plaintiffs' argument as presenting both facial and as-\napplied takings challenges.\n\n                                   -17-\n\ftakings challenges, and sought a declaratory judgment and an\n\ninjunction against enforcement of the act by the Commissioner of\n\nSocial Security.          Apfel, 524 U.S. at 520.           Eastern did not seek\n\ncompensation.       Id.\n\n            A plurality concluded that the availability of Tucker Act\n\ncompensation did not prevent Eastern from asserting its takings\n\nclaim.     It did so because to require Eastern to assert its claim\n\nwould result in an \"utterly pointless set of exercises,\" since\n\n\"Congress could not have contemplated that the Treasury would\n\ncompensate coal operators for their liability under the Act, for\n\n'[e]very dollar paid pursuant to a statute would be presumed to\n\ngenerate a dollar of Tucker Act compensation.'\"                       Id. at 521\n\n(quoting In re Chateaugay Corp., 53 F.3d 478, 493 (2d Cir. 1995)).\n\nInstead,     \"the     Declaratory       Judgment      Act    allows   individuals\n\nthreatened     with       a    taking   to     seek   a     declaration    of   the\n\nconstitutionality         of   the   disputed    governmental     action    before\n\npotentially uncompensable damages are sustained.\"                 Id. (quotation\n\nmarks omitted).\n\n            In Flores Galarza, we analogized the takings claim raised\n\nby JUA to the claim raised in Apfel.                      Although we recognized\n\ndifferences between the two contexts, we stated that \"the nature of\n\n[JUA's] claim -- that Puerto Rico's Secretary of the Treasury\n\nimproperly withheld money belonging to the JUA so that it may be\n\nused for public purposes -- strikes us as equivalent to the\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fcomplaints against the 'direct transfer of funds' at issue in Apfel\n\nand the decisions its cites.\"        See Flores Galarza, 484 F.3d at 20.\n\n            Here, even before the passage of Law 230, Plaintiffs have\n\nsought to enjoin the transfer of the duplicate premiums to the\n\nSecretary and a declaratory judgment that such a transfer was\n\nunlawful.    In other words, Plaintiffs have consistently sought \"a\n\ndeclaration of the constitutionality of the disputed governmental\n\naction before potentially uncompensable damages are sustained.\"\n\nApfel, 524 U.S. at 521.           Thus, to require Plaintiffs to seek\n\ncompensation for property taken when it has continually sought to\n\nenjoin such takings in the first place \"would entail an utterly\n\npointless set of activities.\"          Flores Galarza, 484 F.3d at 20\n\n(citations and quotation marks omitted). Since Plaintiffs' takings\n\nclaim for declaratory and injunctive relief mirrors the claims in\n\nFlores Galarza and Apfel in this crucial respect, we hold that they\n\nare ripe.\n\n            For the above reasons, we reverse the district court and\n\nhold that Plaintiffs' takings claim is ripe with respect to their\n\nrequests for declaratory and injunctive relief.\n\n            B.    The Due Process Claim\n\n            Plaintiffs also contend that Law 230 violates the Due\n\nProcess Clause because it is a \"spurious escheat statute\" that\n\ntransfers   the    duplicate     premiums   to   the   Commonwealth   without\n\nproviding   notice    of   the   transfers.      Specifically,   Plaintiffs\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fchallenge the transfer of the Reserve account from JUA every two\n\nyears   to   balance   the   budget,   which   they   contend   effects   an\n\n\"escheat\" of the premiums to the Commonwealth in violation of\n\nPuerto Rico law, which requires seven years of abandonment before\n\nthe Commonwealth can take over the funds.        See P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n\n26, § 2603; id. § 2612 (\"The [general provision governing unclaimed\n\nfunds] shall prevail over the provisions of any other chapter\n\npresent or future which may be in conflict herewith.\"). Plaintiffs\n\nargue that because Law 230 \"did not provide any notice to the\n\npersons who might have an interest in\" the transferred duplicate\n\npremiums, it violates their due process rights.11\n\n             As discussed in more detail below, although we agree with\n\nPlaintiffs that they have a sufficient property interest in the\n\nduplicate premiums for purposes of due process, we remand for\n\nfurther proceedings to determine whether the transfers to the\n\n\n11\n   We note that Plaintiffs' due process claim only goes to the lack\nof notice of the transfer of the duplicate premiums to the\nSecretary pursuant to Law 230. Plaintiffs do not challenge the\nsufficiency of the notice post-transfer but prior to escheat.\n\n    We further note that Puerto Rico's insurance code requires\n\"[e]very insurer and every general agent, manager, or producer\" to\nproduce a report of all unclaimed premiums, see P.R. Laws Ann. tit.\n26, § 2604(1), and \"cause notices to be published based on the\ninformation contained in the reports.\" Id. § 2605(1). Moreover,\n\"[s]uch notice must be published once a week for two (2)\nconsecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in Puerto\nRico.\"   Id.   Presumably, \"general agent, manager, or producer\"\nincludes the Secretary, but we do not need to address the matter\nhere.   See id. § 2612 (\"The provisions of this chapter shall\nprevail over the provisions of any other chapter present or future\nwhich may be in conflict herewith.\").\n\n                                   -20-\n\fSecretary constitutes a sufficient deprivation of that property\n\ninterest to require notice under the Due Process Clause.\n\n                        1.   Relevant Procedural Background\n\n            The district court did not directly address this specific\n\ndue   process    challenge      with   respect    to    Plaintiffs'    claim      for\n\nequitable relief.12           As background, the district court denied\n\nPlaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive relief based on their\n\ndue process claims because Plaintiffs failed to assert a likelihood\n\nof success on the merits.         García-Rubiera, 516 F. Supp. 2d at 196.\n\nThe district court found that Plaintiffs \"have not shown that\n\navailable remedies under the Commonwealth law are inadequate to\n\nredress   any    deprivation      resulting      from   the    transfer      of   the\n\nDuplicate Premiums to the Secretary;\" specifically, Plaintiffs\n\nfailed    to    \"make    [an]   evidentiary      proffer      to   support      their\n\nallegations that Procedure No. 96 is onerous and 'difficult if not\n\nimpossible.'\" Id. (citing Rumford Pharmacy, Inc. v. E. Providence,\n\n970 F.2d 996, 999 (1st Cir. 1992)).              The district court further\n\nnoted that since \"Plaintiffs appear to have an adequate remedy at\n\nlaw which they have elected not to pursue,\" they \"will not . . .\n\nsuffer irreparable injury if denied equitable relief.\"                    Id.     The\n\ndistrict court proceeded to enter a preliminary injunction, which\n\nit later made permanent, only as to Plaintiffs' claims with respect\n\n\n12\n   The district court dismissed Plaintiffs' due process claims for\ncompensatory damages on qualified immunity grounds, and we address\nthe dismissal of those claims separately below.\n\n                                       -21-\n\fto the interest earned by the duplicate premiums.               Id. at 197.\n\nLeft unaddressed was Plaintiffs' due process claim with respect to\n\nnotice.    The district court instead focused on Plaintiffs' claim\n\nthat Procedure No. 96 was \"onerous.\"13         Id. at 196.\n\n            In fact, although the district court denied preliminary\n\ninjunctive relief with respect to the duplicate premiums, the court\n\nnever explicitly disposed of Plaintiffs' due process claim.             After\n\ndenying preliminary injunctive relief, the district court proceeded\n\nto enter a final judgment setting forth the terms of the permanent\n\ninjunction as to the interest generated by the duplicate premiums,\n\nand further stated that \"[j]udgment is also entered dismissing all\n\nclaims against [Defendants] in their personal capacities.\"\n\n                     2.   Analysis\n\n            Since Plaintiffs challenge the district court's denial of\n\npreliminary      injunctive   relief,   \"'we   scrutinize    abstract   legal\n\nmatters de novo, findings of fact for clear error, and judgment\n\ncalls     with    considerable   deference     to   the     trier.'\"      See\n\nWaterproofing Sys., Inc. v. Hydro-Stop, Inc., 440 F.3d 24, 28 (1st\n\nCir. 2006) (quoting Re-Ace, Inc. v. Wheeled Coach Indus., Inc., 363\n\nF.3d 51, 55 (1st Cir. 2004)).           Moreover, based on the above, we\n\nconstrue the district court's actions as denying Plaintiffs' due\n\n\n13\n    We speculate that one reason why the district court did not\naddress this particular due process claim may be because Plaintiffs\ndid not adequately present the claim below. However, Defendants do\nnot assert waiver as a defense, and as both parties briefed the\nissue, we address it.\n\n                                     -22-\n\fprocess claim for equitable relief.          Thus, we review the denial of\n\ndeclaratory relief \"for something akin to abuse of discretion.\"\n\nSee Rossi v. Gemma, 489 F.3d 26, 38 & n.21 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\nSimilarly, we review the denial of a permanent injunction for abuse\n\nof discretion, with any legal conclusions reviewed de novo and any\n\nfactual findings reviewed for clear error. See Aponte v. Calderón,\n\n284 F.3d 184, 191 (1st Cir. 2002) (\"Generally, we review a grant of\n\na permanent injunction for abuse of discretion, but we always\n\nreview questions of law de novo [and] factual findings for clear\n\nerror.\" (citations omitted)).\n\n           To the extent that Plaintiffs are entitled to notice,\n\nthey   clearly   lack   it   here.     Due    process   requires   \"'notice\n\nreasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise\n\ninterested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an\n\nopportunity to present their objections.'\"          Jones v. Flowers, 547\n\nU.S. 220, 226 (2006) (quoting Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &\n\nTrust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950)); see also Taylor v. Westly,\n\n488 F.3d 1197, 1201 (9th Cir. 2007) (same).         In other words, \"when\n\nnotice is a person's due . . . [t]he means employed must be such as\n\none desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably\n\nadopt to accomplish it.\"      Jones, 547 U.S. at 229 (quoting Mullane,\n\n339 U.S. at 315).\n\n           Here, Plaintiffs do not challenge the adequacy of the\n\nnotice provided by Law 230.     Plaintiffs instead claim that, on its\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\fface, Law 230 provides no notice of the transfer of the duplicate\n\npremiums from JUA to the Secretary every two years.              Based upon our\n\nown review of Law 230 and Procedure No. 96, we agree.                      Law 230\n\nmakes no mention of notice.         Instead, Law 230 only directs that the\n\nfunds in the Reserve account be transferred to the Secretary.\n\nProcedure No. 96 also fails to provide notice.              It provides that a\n\nreimbursement claim can be made \"through the Public Insurance Area\n\nthrough   Form   SC-4601,    Request       for   Reimbursement      of   Mandatory\n\nInsurance,\" and that \"[s]ame shall be available in the Internet or\n\nat Collector's Offices.\"        Procedure No. 96 also sets forth the\n\nproof necessary to file a successful reimbursement claim.                  Despite\n\nall of these provisions, no mention of notice is made.                The closest\n\nProcedure No. 96 comes to indicating notice is a direction that,\n\nupon transfer, JUA \"shall forward an electronic file . . . which\n\nshall contain the information which is indicated in Attachment 1,\n\nbearing those insureds that are entitled to such reimbursement.\"\n\nProcedure No. 96, however, does not further direct that those named\n\ninsureds receive notice of the transfer.\n\n           In    response,    Defendants         argue,   without     citing    any\n\nsupporting   authority,      that    Plaintiffs     had   \"plenty     of   notice\"\n\nbecause they filed this action prior to the enactment of Law 230.\n\nHowever, Plaintiffs' actual notice has no bearing in this case\n\nbecause   Plaintiffs    assert       a    facial    challenge    to      Law   230.\n\nPlaintiffs argue that Law 230 is unconstitutional on its face\n\n\n                                         -24-\n\fbecause it fails to include a process whereby motor vehicle owners\n\nwho paid duplicate premiums are provided notice that their premiums\n\nare going to be transferred to, and held by, the Secretary.\n\nDefendants do not dispute the absence of such a provision.                  Thus,\n\nactual notice cannot defeat Plaintiffs' due process claim.\n\n          Defendants also argue, again without citing supporting\n\nauthority,    that    the    mere   passage   and    publication     of   Law   230\n\nprovided notice of the transfers of the duplicate premiums and the\n\nmechanism by which the payers of duplicate premiums could seek\n\nreimbursement.       However, Plaintiffs' argument is not that due\n\nprocess required them to receive notice of the available procedure\n\nfor obtaining reimbursement.          See City of West Covina v. Perkins,\n\n525 U.S. 234, 241 (1999) (\"Once the property owner is informed that\n\nhis property has been seized, he can turn to [the state statute or\n\ncase law] to learn about the remedial procedures available to\n\nhim.\").   Rather, their claim is that they are entitled to notice\n\nthat the Commonwealth is about to assert a contrary property\n\ninterest in their duplicate premiums.            In such circumstances, mere\n\npublication    of    the    law   effectuating   a    seizure   of   a    property\n\ninterest does not constitute constitutionally adequate notice. See\n\nMullane, 339 U.S. at 314 (\"Th[e] right to be heard has little\n\nreality or worth unless one is informed that the matter [affecting\n\none's property rights] is pending and can choose for himself\n\n\n\n\n                                      -25-\n\fwhether to appear or default, acquiesce or contest\"); see also\n\nCovina, 525 U.S. at 240 (same, quoting Mullane).\n\n            But     Plaintiffs      must      first    establish         at   least   two\n\nthreshold requirements before it is entitled to notice under the\n\nDue Process Clause.             First, \"[a] threshold requirement for a\n\nsuccessful procedural due process claim is to demonstrate the\n\nimplication of a constitutionally protected interest in life,\n\nliberty,     or    property.\"          Aponte,       284    F.3d    at     191   (citing\n\nRomero-Barceló v. Hernández-Agosto, 75 F.3d 23, 32 (1st Cir.\n\n1996)).      Plaintiffs     have      demonstrated         such    an   interest.      In\n\ngeneral, we perform the same analysis in determining whether a\n\nproperty interest is sufficient under both the Takings Clause and\n\nthe Due Process Clause.         See Picard v. Members of Employee Ret. Bd.\n\nof Providence, 275 F.3d 139, 144 (1st Cir. 2001) (noting that \"[i]n\n\nevaluating whether a purported contract or property right is\n\nentitled to constitutional protection under the Takings Clause,\n\nContract Clause, or Due Process Clause, this Court generally looks\n\nto state law as interpreted by the state's highest court\" (citing\n\ncases)); cf. Nat'l Educ. Ass'n-R.I. v. Ret. Bd. of the R.I.\n\nEmployees'      Ret.    Sys.,   172    F.3d    22,    30    (1st    Cir.      1999)   (\"An\n\nexpectation that is not 'property' for purposes of the Takings\n\nClause    may     yet   sometimes      entitle    the      citizen       to   procedural\n\nprotection . . . before the expectation is cut off by government\n\naction.\").        Since   we    hold   that     Plaintiffs        have    a   sufficient\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\finterest in the duplicate premiums for Takings Clause purposes, we\n\nalso   hold    that   Plaintiffs   have   a   sufficient   interest   in   the\n\nduplicate premiums for Due Process Clause purposes.\n\n              Once a property interest is established, Plaintiffs must\n\nthen show that \"the defendants, acting under color of state law,\n\ndeprived [them] of that property interest without constitutionally\n\nadequate process.\"       See SFW Arecibo, Ltd. v. Rodríguez, 415 F.3d\n\n135, 139 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting PFZ Props., Inc. v. Rodríguez,\n\n928 F.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir. 1991)) (emphasis added).            In this case,\n\nthe alleged deprivation caused by Law 230 -- the transfer of the\n\nduplicate premiums to the Secretary -- does not cause a permanent\n\nescheat.       Instead, the funds are to be held in trust by the\n\nSecretary until the escheat period set forth under Puerto Rico\n\ninsurance law passes.\n\n              The Supreme Court has held that \"even the temporary or\n\npartial impairments to property rights that attachments, liens, and\n\nsimilar encumbrances entail are sufficient to merit due process\n\nprotection.\"     See Connecticut v. Doehr, 501 U.S. 1, 12 (1991).           In\n\nDoehr, for example, a Connecticut statute permitted plaintiffs in\n\ncivil suits to obtain ex parte attachments against defendants with\n\na showing so minimal -- an averment by the plaintiff that the\n\ndefendant is liable -- that it resulted in a \"significant risk of\n\nerroneous deprivation.\" Id. at 21. Following Doehr, in Reardon v.\n\nUnited States, 947 F.2d 1509 (1st Cir. 1991) (en banc), we held\n\n\n                                    -27-\n\fthat filing a CERCLA lien without notice or a pre-deprivation\n\nproceeding constituted a sufficient deprivation of property since\n\n\"[t]he EPA's lien has substantially the same effect . . . as the\n\nattachment had on the [property owner] in Doehr -- clouding title,\n\nlimiting     alienability,       [and]   affecting        current    and   potential\n\nmortgages.\"     Id. at 1518.\n\n             The alleged deprivation caused by Law 230 has some\n\nsimilarities to the \"temporary or partial\" deprivations in Doehr\n\nand Reardon. Like a lien or attachment, the alleged deprivation in\n\nthis case is \"temporary or partial,\" because Law 230 allows payers\n\nof   the     duplicate     premiums      to     receive    reimbursement.          The\n\ndeprivation here, like in Doehr and Reardon, only results in a\n\n\"risk   of    erroneous       deprivation.\"        Doehr,      501    U.S.   at   21.\n\nMoreover,     like    a   lien    or   attachment,    the    Secretary,      through\n\noperation     of     Puerto    Rico's    general     escheat    statute,     has    a\n\ncontingent interest in the duplicate premiums, one that poses a\n\nrisk of complete deprivation should Plaintiffs fail to obtain\n\nreimbursement during the escheat period.\n\n             But the alleged deprivation in this case differs from the\n\ndeprivations in Doehr and Reardon in two important respects.\n\nFirst, unlike in Doehr or Reardon, Plaintiffs do not have use of\n\nthe duplicate premiums prior to the transfer, as they are already\n\nheld in trust by JUA.            The transfers only result in a change of\n\ntrustees.     Second, the laws at issue in Doehr and Reardon created\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\fthe liens or attachments at issue without adequate due process. In\n\nthis case, however, the Secretary already has a contingent interest\n\nprior to the transfer, insofar as the escheat period had already\n\nbegun to run prior to the transfer.               The only change effected by\n\nthe transfer, apart from the change in trustee, is the change in\n\nprocedure to obtain reimbursement. In sum, the alleged deprivation\n\nhere is not the creation of a lien or attachment without due\n\nprocess, as was the case in Doehr and Reardon, but the transfer of\n\nproperty held by one party to a different party and the imposition\n\nof   a   different     (and      allegedly      more       onerous)    reimbursement\n\nprocedure.\n\n            In   their     takings     claim,    Plaintiffs          claim    that   the\n\nprocedure to obtain reimbursement, Procedure No. 96, is so onerous\n\nthat the change in procedure is, in effect, a \"spurious escheat.\"\n\nHere, they also claim that the transfer constitutes a \"spurious\n\nescheat,\"     but    provide     no    briefing      on     whether     the     alleged\n\ndeprivation      (change    in    trustee     plus     a    change    in     procedure)\n\nconstitutes a sufficient deprivation for purposes of the Due\n\nProcess Clause. Defendants also provide no briefing on whether the\n\ntransfers     here    result      in   a    deprivation        of     constitutional\n\nsignificance.       They only argue that any notice here was adequate.\n\nFinally, as noted above, the district court did not reach the\n\nissue.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\f               Given the lack of briefing and the district court's\n\nsilence on this issue, we conclude that the more prudent course is\n\nto    remand    to     the    district     court     for   further   proceedings   to\n\ndetermine whether the transfers of the duplicate premiums mandated\n\nby Law 230 constitute a sufficient deprivation for purposes of the\n\nDue Process Clause.\n\n               C.    The Equal Protection Claim\n\n               In addition to their due process challenge, Plaintiffs\n\ncontend that the district court erred with respect to their equal\n\nprotection claim.             The district court dismissed the claim in a\n\nfootnote,       stating       that    it   \"finds     without   merit    Plaintiffs'\n\nundeveloped arguments that the Secretary's action . . . violates\n\ntheir rights to equal protection.\" García-Rubiera, 516 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 188 n.10.\n\n               Plaintiffs fare no better here.               Plaintiffs claim that\n\nthey were \"singled out\" as payers of the duplicate premiums to\n\naddress the shortfalls in the Commonwealth's budget.                    \"When social\n\nor economic legislation is at issue, the Equal Protection Clause\n\nallows the States wide latitude . . . and the Constitution presumes\n\nthat even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the\n\ndemocratic processes.\"             City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr.,\n\n473    U.S.         432,     440     (1985)     (internal    citations     omitted).\n\nAccordingly, in cases that do not involve a protected class, \"the\n\nEqual Protection Clause requires only a rational means to serve a\n\n\n                                              -30-\n\flegitimate end.\"         Id. at 442.      Neither Law 230 nor Law 414 is\n\ndirected to a protected class, and the Commonwealth's actions in\n\ntransferring       and   using    the   funds,    whatever      their   merit,   is\n\ncertainly rational, serving the legitimate end of balancing the\n\nbudget.      Thus, no equal protection violation occurred.\n\n              D.   Qualified Immunity\n\n              Plaintiffs additionally claim that the district court\n\nerred   in    finding    that    Defendants      were   entitled   to    qualified\n\nimmunity as to Plaintiffs' claims for compensatory damages against\n\nthe Defendants in their personal capacities under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n\nWe review the district court's allowance of qualified immunity de\n\nnovo.   Jennings v. Jones, 499 F.3d 2, 10 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n              To   determine     qualified     immunity,   we    have   \"typically\n\napplied . . . a three part test in which we inquire:\"\n\n              (1) whether the claimant has alleged the\n              deprivation of an actual constitutional right;\n              (2) whether the right was clearly established\n              at the time of the alleged action or inaction;\n              and\n              (3) if both of these questions are answered in\n              the   affirmative,   whether  an   objectively\n              reasonable official would have believed that\n              the action taken violated that clearly\n              established constitutional right.\n\nId. (quoting Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto, 253 F.3d 137, 141 (1st\n\nCir. 2001)).\n\n              In its order the district court ultimately found that\n\nDefendants were entitled to qualified immunity.                  As to the first\n\nprong, the district court found that Plaintiffs' amended complaint\n\n                                        -31-\n\fsufficiently alleged a due process claim and a takings claim with\n\nrespect to the interest earned by the duplicate premiums, finding\n\nearlier   that   Plaintiffs'   takings   claim   with   respect   to   the\n\nduplicate premiums was not ripe.      García-Rubiera, 516 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 192-93.   However, as to the second prong, the district court\n\nrelied upon our finding in Flores Galarza that \"after enactment of\n\n[Law 230], which specifically required the JUA to transfer to the\n\nSecretary all funds held in the Reserve as of December 31, 2001,\n\nthe law did not clearly establish . . . that withholding any of the\n\ndesignated Reserve . . . [and the interest it generates] was an\n\nunconstitutional taking.\"      Id. at 193 (quoting Flores Galarza, 484\n\nF.3d at 35) (emphasis in original).      Moreover, the district court\n\nheld that, \"[r]egarding Plaintiffs' procedural due process claim,\n\nthe law was not clearly established that to the effect that the\n\ncustodial transfer of funds pursuant to a Commonwealth statute and\n\nthe provision of a compensation procedure did not comport with due\n\nprocess requirements.\"    Id. at 193-94.   As to the third prong, the\n\ndistrict court relied upon our finding in Flores Galarza that \"a\n\nreasonable officer in [the Secretary's] circumstances would have\n\nbelieved that he had a law mandate, stemming from [Law 230], to\n\nretain for use by the Department of Treasury the Reserve Fund\n\nrecognized by JUA as of December 31, 2001.         Any officer in his\n\nshoes would have acted as he did in immediately retaining the full\n\nReserve Fund [and interest] without any compensation to the JUA [or\n\n\n                                  -32-\n\fPlaintiffs].\"   Id. at 194 (quoting Flores Galarza, 484 F.3d at 36)\n\n(alterations in the original).        Accordingly, the district court\n\nconcluded that \"[t]he same rationale applies to the takings and\n\nprocedural   due   process   claims   asserted   in   this   case.\"   Id.\n\nFinally, the district court held that all of these findings applied\n\nequally to the Governor.     Id. at 195.\n\n          We identify no error in the district court's analysis,\n\nand see no reason to revisit anything we previously determined in\n\nFlores Galarza.    We only add that the conclusions we reached in\n\nFlores Galarza apply equally to Plaintiffs' takings claims with\n\nrespect to the duplicate premiums. See Pearson v. Callahan, 129 S.\n\nCt. 808, 818 (2009) (establishment of constitutional violation\n\nunnecessary when other prongs are established in order to find\n\nqualified immunity).     Accordingly, we affirm the district court\n\nwith respect to its grant of qualified immunity to Defendants.\n\n          E.    Class Certification\n\n          Plaintiffs finally challenge the denial of their motion\n\nto certify a class.      We generally review the denial of class\n\ncertification for abuse of discretion.           See McKenna v. First\n\nHorizon Home Loan Corp., 475 F.3d 418, 422 (1st Cir. 2007).           Any\n\nlegal rulings are reviewed de novo.        Tardiff v. Knox County, 365\n\nF.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          Below, Plaintiffs moved to certify a class of \"all motor\n\nvehicle owners [sic] residents of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\n\n                                  -33-\n\fwho during the years 1997 to 2007 have paid the compulsory motor\n\nvehicle insurance premiums and have also acquired traditional\n\ninsurance    and   have    not   been    reimbursed    with   the    compulsory\n\ninsurance premiums.\"       García-Rubiera, 516 F. Supp. 2d at 198.            The\n\ndistrict court denied class certification because, having dismissed\n\nPlaintiffs' damage claims, the remaining claims for injunctive\n\nrelief, if granted, would \"affect all commonwealth motor vehicle\n\nowners equally.\"     Id.    Accordingly, the district court concluded\n\nthat \"[t]he class action device . . . is not the superior method of\n\nadjudicating Plaintiffs' claims,\" since \"[c]lass certification in\n\nthis case would serve no useful purpose.\"             Id.\n\n            As an initial matter, although the district court did not\n\ndirectly address whether Plaintiffs satisfied the prerequisites of\n\nRule 23(a), we note that they are easily satisfied here.                    As to\n\nnumerosity, Plaintiffs estimate the class to be around 500,000,\n\nwhich they calculate based on the fact that JUA reserved amounts to\n\nreimburse on an estimate that 17% to 25% of all registered motor\n\nvehicle owners paid duplicate premiums, see Flores Galarza, 484\n\nF.3d at 8-9, and that, according to Plaintiffs, there are three\n\nmillion registered motor vehicle owners.              Although Plaintiffs do\n\nnot provide a basis for their estimate of the total number of\n\nregistered motor vehicle owners, we independently conclude that\n\nnumerosity    is    satisfied.     The     money   withheld     by    JUA     for\n\nreimbursement ($20 million) as compared to the amount of the\n\n\n                                        -34-\n\fduplicate premiums ($99 or $148) paid by motor vehicle owners shows\n\nthat the total number of individuals in the class far exceeds the\n\nlow threshold for numerosity.       See Stewart v. Abraham, 275 F.3d\n\n220, 226-27 (3d Cir. 2001) (\"No minimum number of plaintiffs is\n\nrequired to maintain a suit as a class action, but generally if the\n\nnamed   plaintiff   demonstrates    that   the   potential   number   of\n\nplaintiffs exceeds 40, the first prong of Rule 23(a) has been\n\nmet.\") (citations omitted).    Commonality and typicality are easily\n\nmet as well, since there are \"questions of law or fact common to\n\nthe class,\" see Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)(2), and Plaintiffs' claims\n\n\"arise[] from the same event or practice or course of conduct that\n\ngives rise to the claims of other class members, and . . . are\n\nbased on the same legal theory.\"     See In re Am. Med. Sys., Inc., 75\n\nF.3d 1069, 1082 (6th Cir. 1996) (discussing typicality under Rule\n\n23(a)(3), quoting 1 Herbert B. Newberg & Alba Conte, Newberg on\n\nClass Actions § 3.13 (3d ed. 1992)).       And there is no reason to\n\nquestion the adequacy of representation in this case, see Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 23(a)(4) & 23(g), as Plaintiffs and counsel have diligently\n\npursued their rights since enactment of Law 230.\n\n          That said, the district court committed legal error in\n\ndenying class certification.    To obtain certification of a class,\n\nPlaintiffs must establish the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) and fall\n\nwithin one of the categories of Rule 23(b).        See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n23(a)(1)-(4) & 23(b)(1)-(3); see also Smilow v. Southwestern Bell\n\n\n                                   -35-\n\fMobile Sys., Inc., 323 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir. 2003).                  In addressing\n\nPlaintiffs' motion to certify a class, the district court applied\n\nRule 23(b)(3), which requires Plaintiffs to show, among other\n\nthings, that \"a class action is superior to other available methods\n\nfor fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\"                     Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 23(b)(3).     However, Rule 23(b)(3) applies to class actions\n\nsolely asserting damage claims that do not otherwise fit within the\n\nother Rule 23(b) categories, see Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor,\n\n521 U.S. 591, 614-15 (1997), and all damages claims in this case\n\nwere   dismissed.     Instead,         class     actions   asserting    injunctive\n\nrelief, as the one here, fit under Rule 23(b)(2), which applies\n\nwhen \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on\n\ngrounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive\n\nrelief . . . is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\"                    Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 23(b)(2); see also Robinson v. Metro-North Commuter R.R.\n\nCo., 267 F.3d 147, 162 (2d Cir. 2001) (Rule 23(b)(2) \"is intended\n\nfor cases where broad, class-wide injunctive or declaratory relief\n\nis necessary to redress a group-wide injury.\").                        Unlike Rule\n\n23(b)(3), Rule 23(b)(2) has no superiority requirement.                       Because\n\nthe    district     court        denied    Plaintiffs'      motion      for    class\n\ncertification     based     on    a   requirement    that   did   not   apply,    it\n\ncommitted reversible legal error.\n\n           Accordingly, we reverse the district court's denial of\n\nPlaintiffs' motion for class certification and, having found that\n\n\n                                          -36-\n\fPlaintiffs have satisfied all of the requirements necessary to\n\ncertify a class, we direct the district court to certify one\n\nconsistent with this opinion.\n\n                         III.    Conclusion\n\n          In sum, we reverse the district court and hold that\n\nPlaintiffs' takings claim for declaratory and injunctive relief is\n\nripe. With respect to Plaintiffs' due process claim, we remand for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.         We affirm the\n\ndenial of Plaintiffs' equal protection claim.             We affirm the\n\ndistrict court's dismissal of Plaintiffs' compensatory damages\n\nclaims on qualified immunity grounds.         Finally, we reverse the\n\ndistrict court's denial of class certification and remand directing\n\nthe district court to certify a class consistent with this opinion.\n\n          Affirmed-in-part,     reversed-in-part,   and    remanded   for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each side shall\n\nbear their own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -37-\n\f",

The premiums, initially collected by the Secretary of the Treasury (the \"Secretary\"), are transferred to the Compulsory Liability Joint Underwriting Association of Puerto Rico (\"JUA\"), a Commonwealth-created association of all private insurers in Puerto Rico. JUA then provides the compulsory car insurance.</p>\n<p>Motor vehicle owners can opt out of the compulsory liability insurance scheme by privately purchasing insurance with the same or comparable coverage. Those owners who opt out can either avoid paying the uniform premium at vehicle registration or seek reimbursement of the \"duplicate premium\" paid.</p>\n<p>The amendments at issue in this appeal, Law 230 and Law 414, concern the duplicate premiums collected by JUA. In essence, the amendments mandate the transfer of funds designated by JUA for the reimbursement of duplicate premiums (plus the interest they generate) <i>back to</i> the Secretary for use by the Commonwealth to address budget shortfalls. Moreover, Law 230 promulgates a separate procedure, Procedure No. 96, to provide reimbursement.</p>\n<p>In 2002, the plaintiffs-appellants (the \"Plaintiffs\"), all owners of motor vehicles in Puerto Rico who privately purchased car insurance but paid duplicate premiums, filed suit against the Secretary and the Governor of the Commonwealth (the \"Governor\" and, together with the Secretary, the \"Defendants\") in their official and personal capacities.<sup>[1]</sup> Plaintiffs claim that Law 230 and Law 414 violate the Takings, Due Process, and Equal Protection Clauses. They sought declaratory relief, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, reimbursement, compensatory damages, and certification of a class of similarly situated vehicle owners. The district court denied almost all relief requested, including Plaintiffs' request for class certification. However, the district court granted a preliminary injunction, later made permanent, enjoining the transfer of the interest generated by the duplicate premiums and ordering the Commonwealth to develop an adequate scheme of reimbursement of that interest. This appeal followed. After careful consideration, we affirm-in-part, reverse-in-part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Our discussion of Law 253 and the amendments at issue in this appeal draw from, and incorporate by reference, our prior decisions concerning Law 253. <i>See </i><i>Asociación De Subscripción Conjunta Del Seguro De Responsibilidad Obligatorio v. Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Arroyo-Melecio v. Puerto Rican Am. Ins. Co.,</i> 398 F.3d 56 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Law 253</h2>\n<p>Law 253, codified at P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 8051-61, requires liability insurance coverage for all registered motor vehicles in Puerto Rico \"that travel on public thoroughfares.\" <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 6. To that end, Law 253 provides for compulsory liability insurance, \"`with $3000 of coverage for damages caused to third parties <span class=\"star-pagination\">*448</span> per accident in exchange for a uniform premium, initially set at $99 for each private passenger vehicle and $148 for each commercial vehicle.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Arroyo-Melecio,</i> 398 F.3d at 60-61). The compulsory liability insurance is provided by JUA, \"an association of all private insurers in Puerto Rico.\" <i>Id.</i> at 7. JUA must provide this coverage to all drivers, even high risk ones, with \"`the risk of insuring these high-risk drivers ... spread among all of the private insurers.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Arroyo-Melecio,</i> 398 F.3d at 62).</p>\n<p>To fund the compulsory liability insurance, Law 253 requires motor vehicle owners to pay the uniform premium annually to the Secretary at the time of acquisition or renewal of vehicle registration. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Arroyo-Melecio,</i> 398 F.3d at 61 n. 2). The Secretary then transfers the premiums periodically to JUA. <i>Id.</i> (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 8055(c)).</p>\n<p>Motor vehicle owners can \"opt out of the compulsory liability insurance scheme by privately purchasing liability insurance with comparable or better coverage.\" <i>See id.</i> at 7 (citing <i>Arroyo-Melecio,</i> 398 F.3d at 61 n. 2). Although, in some circumstances, individual motor vehicle owners who opt out can \"avoid paying the compulsory insurance premium to the Secretary\" at the time of registration, <i>see id.</i> at 7 n. 2, a number of such vehicle owners still pay the compulsory insurance premium.<sup>[2]</sup> For those owners, Law 253 provides for reimbursement; in particular, vehicle owners \"may then seek reimbursement directly from the JUA or from his insurer, who will, in turn, seek reimbursement from the JUA.\" <i>Id.</i> at 7. These procedures are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p>\"Because a portion of the total amount of premiums received by JUA may be owed to third parties who seek refunds for duplicate payments,\" JUA is required by law to \"set aside these premiums and accumulate them in a separate reserve account (the `Reserve').\" <i>Id.</i> at 8. However, since January 1, 1998, the effective date of Law 253, JUA \"has been unable to determine exactly how many registered motor vehicles in Puerto Rico are covered by private liability insurance.\" <i>Id.</i> As a result, JUA has divided the Reserve account between the \"duplicate premiums\" it estimates it is required to reimburse to motor vehicle owners, and an \"overstated\" amount of funds, which are funds set aside by JUA as a buffer to meet all requests for reimbursement. <i>See id.</i> at 8-9.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The general provisions of Puerto Rico insurance law with respect to \"unclaimed funds\" apply to Law 253. <i>See id.</i> at 8 n. 5 (\"Puerto Rico's Insurance Code makes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*449</span> clear that this general provision applies to the compulsory liability insurance system under Law 253.\" (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 2612)). Under Puerto Rico insurance law, vehicle owners have seven years to claim a duplicate premium. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 2603; <i>see also </i><i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 10 n. 9. Otherwise, the duplicate premium escheats to the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Law 230 and Law 414</h2>\n<p>On September 11, 2002, the Puerto Rican legislature enacted Law 230, codified at P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 8055(<i>l</i>). Law 230 requires JUA to <i>retransfer</i> to the Secretary all funds held in the Reserve every two years to balance the Commonwealth's budget. The first transfer mandated under Law 230, $73 million, occurred the same month of Law 230's enactment.<sup>[4]</sup> Law 230 also provided that the Commonwealth could spend $53 million of the funds immediately. The $53 million, according to the Statement of Motives of the subsequently enacted Law 414, corresponded to the overstated funds contained in the Reserve.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Under Law 230, the remaining $20 million, an estimate of the actual duplicate premiums paid, remained in the custody of the Secretary as trustee for five years, after which all unclaimed duplicate premiums became the property of the Commonwealth. However, any income generated by the funds, such as interest, reverted to the Commonwealth's General Fund as it accrued.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, under Law 230, \"the seven-year period provided by the general provisions of Puerto Rico's Insurance Code ... [is divided] among the JUA (which holds the funds for two years) and the Secretary (who holds the funds for five additional years), after which time the funds lapse to the general fund.\" <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 10 n. 9.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to Law 230, the Secretary adopted Procedure No. 96, a procedure by which motor vehicle owners can seek reimbursement from the Secretary. To obtain reimbursement, a vehicle owner must fill out a model form and submit, via mail or at certain designated offices, the following:</p>\n<blockquote>a. Copy of the Motor Vehicle Registration License for which such reimbursement is being claimed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>b. Copy of the insurance policy. Said policy shall be for each year that is being claimed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>c. In the case such that it is the insurance firm which is making the claim, it shall attach certified copies of those policies that it is claiming;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>d. Certification of payment of the policy for each year being claimed. Such certification shall be issued by the insurance firm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>e. Certification that such insurance firm has not received any reimbursement from [JUA], nor has reimbursed the premium for the Mandatory Liability Insurance, to the insured party.</blockquote>\n<p>According to the Statement of Motives of Law 414, the Secretary has only reimbursed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*450</span> approximately $500,000 of duplicate premiums in the first two years of the enactment of Law 230.</p>\n<p>On September 22, 2004, the legislature passed Law 414, also codified at P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 8055(1). Among other things, Law 414 permitted the Commonwealth to use $19 million of the remaining funds transferred in September 2002 to balance the 2004-05 fiscal year budget. Law 414 also requires the Commonwealth to use money from the General Fund and the Budgetary Fund to reimburse vehicle owners if the amount transferred by JUA every two years is not sufficient to satisfy reimbursement requests.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Procedural History</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs are motor vehicle owners who privately purchased liability insurance but also paid duplicate premiums. On February 6, 2002, in anticipation of the passage of Law 230, Plaintiffs filed a complaint in district court seeking equitable relief and damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs refuse to seek reimbursement from the Secretary through Procedure No. 96.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>In their complaint, which has been amended,<sup>[7]</sup> Plaintiffs assert a property interest in the duplicate premiums and the interest they generate. Consequently, Plaintiffs contend that each transfer of the funds from the Reserve account to the Secretary, starting with the $73 million in September of 2002, constitutes a temporary physical appropriation of their property without compensation and without due process, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. They also contend that the Secretary permanently, and unlawfully, appropriated the interest generated by the funds. Finally, they contend that, as payers of the duplicate premiums, they and others similarly situated were singled out by the Commonwealth to address its budget concerns, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<blockquote>Plaintiffs sought</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1. a declaratory judgment that the Governor \"cannot implement\" Laws 230 and 414;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent the transfer of funds from the Reserve to the Secretary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. $70 million in damages from the Secretary and the Governor in their personal capacities; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. costs and attorneys' fees.<sup>[8]</sup></blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*451</span> Plaintiffs also sought to certify a class. The Governor and the Secretary each moved to dismiss the claims, claiming, among other things, qualified immunity. Plaintiffs opposed, and moved separately for a preliminary injunction and class certification.</p>\n<p>On August 30, 2007, the district court issued an opinion and order that addressed these various motions. <i>García-Rubiera v. Flores-Galarza,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d 180 (D.P.R.2007). In the order, the district court dismissed as unripe the takings claim with respect to the duplicate premiums, since Plaintiffs had not availed themselves of their administrative remedy under Procedure No. 96. <i>Id.</i> at 188-90. The order also dismissed Plaintiffs' damages claims against the Secretary and the Treasurer in their personal capacities, finding that both were entitled to qualified immunity. <i>Id.</i> at 194-95. The district court further denied preliminary injunctive relief that would have prevented the Commonwealth from taking title to those duplicate premiums transferred in September 2002, which were scheduled to escheat to the Commonwealth in September 2007. <i>Id.</i> at 195-96. The district court also denied Plaintiffs' motion for class certification. <i>Id.</i> at 198. However, the district court granted a preliminary injunction, made permanent, that enjoined Defendants from depositing into the General Fund any interest generated by the duplicate premiums. <i>Id.</i> at 196-98 &amp; n. 20.</p>\n<p>The district court later entered a separate judgment setting forth the terms of the permanent injunction, whereby it retained jurisdiction until the Commonwealth instituted a constitutionally adequate scheme \"to deal with the interest generated by the Duplicate Premiums.\" It further stated that \"[j]udgment is also entered dismissing all claims against [the Secretary] and [the Governor] in their personal capacities.\" Plaintiffs now appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs raise several issues on appeal. We discuss each in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Takings Claim</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs first argue that the district court erred by dismissing their Takings Clause claim with respect to the duplicate premiums as unripe because of Plaintiffs' refusal to pursue their administrative remedy under Procedure No. 96. As discussed in more detail below, we disagree with the district court and conclude that Plaintiffs' takings claim for declaratory and injunctive relief is ripe despite their failure to utilize Procedure No. 96.</p>\n<p>We review <i>de novo</i> the dismissal of a takings claim on ripeness grounds. <i>Deniz v. Municipality of Guaynabo,</i> 285 F.3d 142, 145 (1st Cir.2002). To assert a ripe takings claim, a plaintiff must satisfy \"`two independent procedural hurdles.'\" <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 13 (quoting <i>Suitum v. Tahoe Reg'l Planning Agency,</i> 520 U.S. 725, 733-34, 117 S.Ct. 1659, 137 L.Ed.2d 980 (1997)). As explained by the Supreme Court in <i>Williamson County Reg'l Planning Commission v. Hamilton Bank,</i> 473 U.S. 172, 105 S.Ct. 3108, 87 L.Ed.2d 126 (1985), a plaintiff asserting a takings claim must demonstrate that (1) he or she \"received a final decision from the state on the use of his property,\" and (2) \"sought compensation through the procedures the State has provided for doing so.\" <i>See </i><i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 13-14 (quoting <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 194, 105 S.Ct. 3108). Plaintiffs have the burden of demonstrating ripeness. <i>See </i><i>Pascoag Reservoir &amp; Dam, LLC v. Rhode Island,</i> 337 F.3d 87, 91 (1st Cir.2003) (holding that \"[a] federal suit is not timely until a plaintiff <i>demonstrates</i>\" ripeness (emphasis added)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*452</span> 1. <i>The Finality Prong</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs satisfy the first, finality prong. First, Plaintiffs have a sufficient property interest in the duplicate premiums to support their takings claim. For purposes of the Takings Clause, \"the existence of a property interest is determined by reference to `existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.'\" <i>See </i><i>Phillips v. Wash. Legal Found.,</i> 524 U.S. 156, 164, 118 S.Ct. 1925, 141 L.Ed.2d 174 (1998) (quoting <i>Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth,</i> 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972)). Here, Puerto Rico law plainly establishes that Plaintiffs have a sufficient property interest in the duplicate premiums. By regulation, JUA must segregate those premiums collected that are thought to be duplicate premiums, and Puerto Rico's insurance law concerning \"unclaimed funds\" apply to the duplicate premiums collected. <i>See </i><i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 8 &amp; n. 5. Furthermore, upon transfer to the Secretary, Law 230 requires the Secretary to hold the duplicate premiums in a fiduciary capacity. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 8055(1) (\"The Secretary of the Treasury shall retain these funds as <i>trustee</i> ....\") (emphasis added). Finally, Law 253, Law 230, and Law 414 all provide for reimbursement of the duplicate premiums. Thus, like funds held in trust in an IOLTA account or an interpleader account, the funds held by JUA or the Secretary are clearly the \"private property\" of Plaintiffs for purposes of the Takings Clause. <i>See </i><i>Phillips,</i> 524 U.S. at 164, 118 S.Ct. 1925 (\"All agree that under Texas law the principal held in IOLTA trust accounts is the `private property' of the client.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith,</i> 449 U.S. 155, 161, 101 S.Ct. 446, 66 L.Ed.2d 358 (1980) (holding that funds deposited in interpleader fund for benefit of creditors are the property of creditors); <i>cf. </i><i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 30 (finding that the duplicate premiums \"`constitute a double payment for the same insurance,' and, therefore, do not belong to JUA, but rather <i>belong to private insured motorists.</i>\") (quotations omitted and emphasis added).<sup>[9]</sup></p>\n<p>Second, the Secretary's appropriation of the duplicate premiums constitutes a \"final decision\" for purposes of the finality prong. \"[T]he finality requirement is concerned with whether the initial decisionmaker has arrived <i>at a definitive position</i> on the issue that inflicts an actual, concrete injury.\" <i>Id.</i> at 15 n. 18 (quoting <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 193, 105 S.Ct. 3108) (emphasis added). As we stated in <i>Flores Galarza,</i></p>\n<blockquote>The case law addressing the first \"hurdle\" focuses on whether the administrative body responsible for applying the challenged regulations has completed discretionary review of the plaintiff's particular situation. Here, there is no pending administrative process that could, through a variance, waiver or other discretionary decision, modify the statute's impact on the JUA.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 15. The same is true here, as there is no pending process that would \"modify the statute's impact\" on Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The Just Compensation Prong</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Consequently, at issue is whether Plaintiffs have satisfied the second, \"just compensation\" prong. The just compensation prong presents some difficulty for Plaintiffs, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*453</span> since Procedure No. 96 provides a procedure to reimburse the duplicate premiums, and Plaintiffs refuse to avail themselves of it. By their own admission, Plaintiffs have not \"sought compensation through the procedures the State has provided for doing so.\" <i>Id.</i> at 14 (citations omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 197, 105 S.Ct. 3108 (holding that the takings claim in that case was unripe \"until [the plaintiff] has utilized th[e] procedure\" for just compensation provided by the state). For that reason, the district court dismissed Plaintiffs' claim as unripe. <i>See </i><i>García-Rubiera,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d at 190.</p>\n<p>However, we have recognized exceptions to the just compensation prong. We have noted that facial challenges to a regulation \"are generally ripe the moment the challenged regulation or ordinance is passed.\" <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 14 (quoting <i>Suitum,</i> 520 U.S. at 736 n. 10, 117 S.Ct. 1659). Moreover, we have held that a plaintiff is relieved of the second prong if the procedure is \"unavailable,\" \"inadequate,\" or \"futile.\" <i>See id.</i> (noting that second prong does not apply when a procedure is \"unavailable or inadequate\" (quoting <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 197, 105 S.Ct. 3108)); <i>see also </i><i>Pascoag,</i> 337 F.3d at 92-93 (noting that futility is an exception to this prong). Finally, we noted in <i>Flores Galarza</i> that the just compensation prong may not apply in certain circumstances to a \"taking that involves the direct appropriation of funds.\" <i>See</i> 484 F.3d at 19.</p>\n<p>On appeal, Plaintiffs argue that all three categories of exceptions apply.<sup>[10]</sup> We agree as to the third category, and conclude that Plaintiffs' claim for declaratory and injunctive relief is ripe because their claim \"involves the direct appropriation of funds.\"</p>\n<p>In <i>Flores Galarza,</i> we noted that the Supreme Court expressed doubt that a federal takings claim seeking declaratory and injunctive relief would require individuals to first seek compensation under the Tucker Act, which is \"usually ... a step in a takings action against the federal government.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing the plurality opinion in <i>Eastern Enters. v. Apfel,</i> 524 U.S. 498, 118 S.Ct. 2131, 141 L.Ed.2d 451 (1998)). <i>Apfel</i> concerned a challenge to the Coal Act, \"which established a mechanism for funding health care benefits for coal industry retirees,\" and which required private coal operators \"to contribute to the payment of premiums to fund such benefits.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Apfel,</i> 524 U.S. at 504, 118 S.Ct. 2131). Eastern, one such private coal operator, brought both facial and as-applied takings challenges, and sought a declaratory judgment and an injunction against enforcement of the act by the Commissioner of Social Security. <i>Apfel,</i> 524 U.S. at 520, 118 S.Ct. 2131. Eastern did not seek compensation. <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>A plurality concluded that the availability of Tucker Act compensation did not prevent Eastern from asserting its takings claim. It did so because to require Eastern to assert its claim would result in an \"utterly pointless set of exercises,\" since \"Congress could not have contemplated that the Treasury would compensate coal operators for their liability under the Act, for `[e]very dollar paid pursuant to a statute would be presumed to generate a dollar of Tucker Act compensation.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 521, 118 S.Ct. 2131 (quoting <i>In re Chateaugay</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*454</span> <i>Corp.,</i> 53 F.3d 478, 493 (2d Cir. 1995)). Instead, \"the Declaratory Judgment Act allows individuals threatened with a taking to seek a declaration of the constitutionality of the disputed governmental action before potentially uncompensable damages are sustained.\" <i>Id.</i> (quotation marks omitted).</p>\n<p>In <i>Flores Galarza,</i> we analogized the takings claim raised by JUA to the claim raised in <i>Apfel.</i> Although we recognized differences between the two contexts, we stated that \"the nature of [JUA's] claim that Puerto Rico's Secretary of the Treasury improperly withheld money belonging to the JUA so that it may be used for public purposesstrikes us as equivalent to the complaints against the `direct transfer of funds' at issue in <i>Apfel</i> and the decisions its cites.\" <i>See </i><i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 20.</p>\n<p>Here, even before the passage of Law 230, Plaintiffs have sought to enjoin the transfer of the duplicate premiums to the Secretary and a declaratory judgment that such a transfer was unlawful. In other words, Plaintiffs have consistently sought \"a declaration of the constitutionality of the disputed governmental action before potentially uncompensable damages are sustained.\" <i>Apfel,</i> 524 U.S. at 521, 118 S.Ct. 2131. Thus, to require Plaintiffs to seek compensation for property taken when it has continually sought to enjoin such takings in the first place \"would entail an utterly pointless set of activities.\" <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 20 (citations and quotation marks omitted). Since Plaintiffs' takings claim for declaratory and injunctive relief mirrors the claims in <i>Flores Galarza</i> and <i>Apfel</i> in this crucial respect, we hold that they are ripe.</p>\n<p>For the above reasons, we reverse the district court and hold that Plaintiffs' takings claim is ripe with respect to their requests for declaratory and injunctive relief.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. The Due Process Claim</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs also contend that Law 230 violates the Due Process Clause because it is a \"spurious escheat statute\" that transfers the duplicate premiums to the Commonwealth without providing notice of the transfers. Specifically, Plaintiffs challenge the transfer of the Reserve account from JUA every two years to balance the budget, which they contend effects an \"escheat\" of the premiums to the Commonwealth in violation of Puerto Rico law, which requires seven years of abandonment before the Commonwealth can take over the funds. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 2603; <i>id.</i> § 2612 (\"The [general provision governing unclaimed funds] shall prevail over the provisions of any other chapter present or future which may be in conflict herewith.\"). Plaintiffs argue that because Law 230 \"did not provide any notice to the persons who might have an interest in\" the transferred duplicate premiums, it violates their due process rights.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*455</span> As discussed in more detail below, although we agree with Plaintiffs that they have a sufficient property interest in the duplicate premiums for purposes of due process, we remand for further proceedings to determine whether the transfers to the Secretary constitutes a sufficient deprivation of that property interest to require notice under the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Relevant Procedural Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court did not directly address this specific due process challenge with respect to Plaintiffs' claim for equitable relief.<sup>[12]</sup> As background, the district court denied Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive relief based on their due process claims because Plaintiffs failed to assert a likelihood of success on the merits. <i>García-Rubiera,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d at 196. The district court found that Plaintiffs \"have not shown that available remedies under the Commonwealth law are inadequate to redress any deprivation resulting from the transfer of the Duplicate Premiums to the Secretary;\" specifically, Plaintiffs failed to \"make [an] evidentiary proffer to support their allegations that Procedure No. 96 is onerous and `difficult if not impossible.'\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Rumford Pharmacy, Inc. v. E. Providence,</i> 970 F.2d 996, 999 (1st Cir.1992)). The district court further noted that since \"Plaintiffs appear to have an adequate remedy at law which they have elected not to pursue,\" they \"will not ... suffer irreparable injury if denied equitable relief.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court proceeded to enter a preliminary injunction, which it later made permanent, only as to Plaintiffs' claims with respect to the interest earned by the duplicate premiums. <i>Id.</i> at 197. Left unaddressed was Plaintiffs' due process claim with respect to notice. The district court instead focused on Plaintiffs' claim that Procedure No. 96 was \"onerous.\"<sup>[13]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 196.</p>\n<p>In fact, although the district court denied preliminary injunctive relief with respect to the duplicate premiums, the court never explicitly disposed of Plaintiffs' due process claim. After denying preliminary injunctive relief, the district court proceeded to enter a final judgment setting forth the terms of the permanent injunction as to the interest generated by the duplicate premiums, and further stated that \"[j]udgment is also entered dismissing all claims against [Defendants] in their personal capacities.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Since Plaintiffs challenge the district court's denial of preliminary injunctive relief, \"`we scrutinize abstract legal matters <i>de novo,</i> findings of fact for clear error, and judgment calls with considerable deference to the trier.'\" <i>See </i><i>Waterproofing Sys., Inc. v. Hydro-Stop, Inc.,</i> 440 F.3d 24, 28 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>Re-Ace, Inc. v. Wheeled Coach Indus., Inc.,</i> 363 F.3d 51, 55 (1st Cir.2004)). Moreover, based on the above, we construe the district court's actions as denying Plaintiffs' due process claim for equitable relief. Thus, we review the denial of declaratory relief \"for something akin to abuse of discretion.\" <i>See </i><i>Rossi v. Gemma,</i> 489 F.3d 26, 38 &amp; n. 21 (1st Cir.2007). Similarly, we review the denial of a permanent injunction <span class=\"star-pagination\">*456</span> for abuse of discretion, with any legal conclusions reviewed <i>de novo</i> and any factual findings reviewed for clear error. <i>See </i><i>Aponte v. Calderón,</i> 284 F.3d 184, 191 (1st Cir.2002) (\"Generally, we review a grant of a permanent injunction for abuse of discretion, but we always review questions of law <i>de novo</i> [and] factual findings for clear error.\" (citations omitted)).</p>\n<p>To the extent that Plaintiffs are entitled to notice, they clearly lack it here. Due process requires \"`notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.'\" <i>Jones v. Flowers,</i> 547 U.S. 220, 226, 126 S.Ct. 1708, 164 L.Ed.2d 415 (2006) (quoting <i>Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co.,</i> 339 U.S. 306, 314, 70 S.Ct. 652, 94 L.Ed. 865 (1950)); <i>see also </i><i>Taylor v. Westly,</i> 488 F.3d 1197, 1201 (9th Cir.2007) (same). In other words, \"when notice is a person's due ... [t]he means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.\" <i>Jones,</i> 547 U.S. at 229, 126 S.Ct. 1708 (quoting <i>Mullane,</i> 339 U.S. at 315, 70 S.Ct. 652).</p>\n<p>Here, Plaintiffs do not challenge the adequacy of the notice provided by Law 230. Plaintiffs instead claim that, on its face, Law 230 provides <i>no</i> notice of the transfer of the duplicate premiums from JUA to the Secretary every two years. Based upon our own review of Law 230 and Procedure No. 96, we agree. Law 230 makes no mention of notice. Instead, Law 230 only directs that the funds in the Reserve account be transferred to the Secretary. Procedure No. 96 also fails to provide notice. It provides that a reimbursement claim can be made \"through the Public Insurance Area through Form SC-4601, Request for Reimbursement of Mandatory Insurance,\" and that \"[s]ame shall be available in the Internet or at Collector's Offices.\" Procedure No. 96 also sets forth the proof necessary to file a successful reimbursement claim. Despite all of these provisions, no mention of notice is made. The closest Procedure No. 96 comes to indicating notice is a direction that, upon transfer, JUA \"shall forward an electronic file ... which shall contain the information which is indicated in Attachment 1, bearing those insureds that are entitled to such reimbursement.\" Procedure No. 96, however, does not further direct that those named insureds receive <i>notice</i> of the transfer.</p>\n<p>In response, Defendants argue, without citing any supporting authority, that Plaintiffs had \"plenty of notice\" because they filed this action prior to the enactment of Law 230. However, Plaintiffs' actual notice has no bearing in this case because Plaintiffs assert a facial challenge to Law 230. Plaintiffs argue that Law 230 is unconstitutional on its face because it fails to include a process whereby motor vehicle owners who paid duplicate premiums are provided notice that their premiums are going to be transferred to, and held by, the Secretary. Defendants do not dispute the absence of such a provision. Thus, actual notice cannot defeat Plaintiffs' due process claim.</p>\n<p>Defendants also argue, again without citing supporting authority, that the mere passage and publication of Law 230 provided notice of the transfers of the duplicate premiums and the mechanism by which the payers of duplicate premiums could seek reimbursement. However, Plaintiffs' argument is not that due process required them to receive notice of the available procedure for obtaining reimbursement. <i>See </i><i>City of West Covina v. Perkins,</i> 525 U.S. 234, 241, 119 S.Ct. 678, 142 L.Ed.2d 636 (1999) (\"Once the property owner is informed that his property has been seized, he can turn to [the state statute or <span class=\"star-pagination\">*457</span> case law] to learn about the remedial procedures available to him.\"). Rather, their claim is that they are entitled to notice that the Commonwealth is about to assert a contrary property interest in their duplicate premiums. In such circumstances, mere publication of the law effectuating a seizure of a property interest does not constitute constitutionally adequate notice. <i>See </i><i>Mullane,</i> 339 U.S. at 314, 70 S.Ct. 652 (\"Th[e] right to be heard has little reality or worth unless one is informed that the matter [affecting one's property rights] is pending and can choose for himself whether to appear or default, acquiesce or contest\"); <i>see also Covina,</i> 525 U.S. at 240, 119 S.Ct. 678 (same, quoting <i>Mullane</i>).</p>\n<p>But Plaintiffs must first establish at least two threshold requirements before it is entitled to notice under the Due Process Clause. First, \"[a] threshold requirement for a successful procedural due process claim is to demonstrate the implication of a constitutionally protected interest in life, liberty, or property.\" <i>Aponte,</i> 284 F.3d at 191 (citing <i>Romero-Barceló v. Hernández-Agosto,</i> 75 F.3d 23, 32 (1st Cir.1996)). Plaintiffs have demonstrated such an interest. In general, we perform the same analysis in determining whether a property interest is sufficient under both the Takings Clause and the Due Process Clause. <i>See </i><i>Picard v. Members of Employee Ret. Bd. of Providence,</i> 275 F.3d 139, 144 (1st Cir.2001) (noting that \"[i]n evaluating whether a purported contract or property right is entitled to constitutional protection under the Takings Clause, Contract Clause, or Due Process Clause, this Court generally looks to state law as interpreted by the state's highest court\" (citing cases)); <i>cf. Nat'l Educ. Ass'n-R.</i><i>I. v. Ret. Bd. of the R.I. Employees' Ret. Sys.,</i> 172 F.3d 22, 30 (1st Cir. 1999) (\"An expectation that is not `property' for purposes of the Takings Clause may yet sometimes entitle the citizen to procedural protection ... before the expectation is cut off by government action.\"). Since we hold that Plaintiffs have a sufficient interest in the duplicate premiums for Takings Clause purposes, we also hold that Plaintiffs have a sufficient interest in the duplicate premiums for Due Process Clause purposes.</p>\n<p>Once a property interest is established, Plaintiffs must then show that \"the defendants, acting under color of state law, <i>deprived</i> [them] of that property interest without constitutionally adequate process.\" <i>See </i><i>SFW Arecibo, Ltd. v. Rodríguez,</i> 415 F.3d 135, 139 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>PFZ Props., Inc. v. Rodríguez,</i> 928 F.2d 28, 30 (1st Cir.1991)) (emphasis added). In this case, the alleged deprivation caused by Law 230the transfer of the duplicate premiums to the Secretarydoes not cause a permanent escheat. Instead, the funds are to be held in trust by the Secretary until the escheat period set forth under Puerto Rico insurance law passes.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has held that \"even the temporary or partial impairments to property rights that attachments, liens, and similar encumbrances entail are sufficient to merit due process protection.\" <i>See </i><i>Connecticut v. Doehr,</i> 501 U.S. 1, 12, 111 S.Ct. 2105, 115 L.Ed.2d 1 (1991). In <i>Doehr,</i> for example, a Connecticut statute permitted plaintiffs in civil suits to obtain ex parte attachments against defendants with a showing so minimalan averment by the plaintiff that the defendant is liablethat it resulted in a \"significant risk of erroneous deprivation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 21, 111 S.Ct. 2105. Following <i>Doehr,</i> in <i>Reardon v. United States,</i> 947 F.2d 1509 (1st Cir. 1991) (en banc), we held that filing a CERCLA lien without notice or a pre-deprivation proceeding constituted a sufficient deprivation of property since \"[t]he EPA's lien has substantially the same effect... as the attachment had on the [property owner] in <i>Doehr</i>clouding title, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*458</span> limiting alienability, [and] affecting current and potential mortgages.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1518.</p>\n<p>The alleged deprivation caused by Law 230 has some similarities to the \"temporary or partial\" deprivations in <i>Doehr</i> and <i>Reardon.</i> Like a lien or attachment, the alleged deprivation in this case is \"temporary or partial,\" because Law 230 allows payers of the duplicate premiums to receive reimbursement. The deprivation here, like in <i>Doehr</i> and <i>Reardon,</i> only results in a \"risk of erroneous deprivation.\" <i>Doehr,</i> 501 U.S. at 21, 111 S.Ct. 2105. Moreover, like a lien or attachment, the Secretary, through operation of Puerto Rico's general escheat statute, has a contingent interest in the duplicate premiums, one that poses a risk of complete deprivation should Plaintiffs fail to obtain reimbursement during the escheat period.</p>\n<p>But the alleged deprivation in this case differs from the deprivations in <i>Doehr</i> and <i>Reardon</i> in two important respects. First, unlike in <i>Doehr</i> or <i>Reardon,</i> Plaintiffs do not have use of the duplicate premiums prior to the transfer, as they are already held in trust by JUA. The transfers only result in a change of trustees. Second, the laws at issue in <i>Doehr</i> and <i>Reardon created</i> the liens or attachments at issue without adequate due process. In this case, however, the Secretary already has a contingent interest prior to the transfer, insofar as the escheat period had already begun to run prior to the transfer. The only change effected by the transfer, apart from the change in trustee, is the change in procedure to obtain reimbursement. In sum, the alleged deprivation here is not the creation of a lien or attachment without due process, as was the case in <i>Doehr</i> and <i>Reardon,</i> but the transfer of property held by one party to a <i>different</i> party and the imposition of a different (and allegedly more onerous) reimbursement procedure.</p>\n<p>In their takings claim, Plaintiffs claim that the procedure to obtain reimbursement, Procedure No. 96, is so onerous that the change in procedure is, in effect, a \"spurious escheat.\" Here, they also claim that the transfer constitutes a \"spurious escheat,\" but provide no briefing on whether the alleged deprivation (change in trustee plus a change in procedure) constitutes a sufficient deprivation for purposes of the Due Process Clause. Defendants also provide no briefing on whether the transfers here result in a deprivation of constitutional significance. They only argue that any notice here was adequate. Finally, as noted above, the district court did not reach the issue.</p>\n<p>Given the lack of briefing and the district court's silence on this issue, we conclude that the more prudent course is to remand to the district court for further proceedings to determine whether the transfers of the duplicate premiums mandated by Law 230 constitute a sufficient deprivation for purposes of the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The Equal Protection Claim</h2>\n<p>In addition to their due process challenge, Plaintiffs contend that the district court erred with respect to their equal protection claim. The district court dismissed the claim in a footnote, stating that it \"finds without merit Plaintiffs' undeveloped arguments that the Secretary's action ... violates their rights to equal protection.\" <i>García-Rubiera,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d at 188 n. 10.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs fare no better here. Plaintiffs claim that they were \"singled out\" as payers of the duplicate premiums to address the shortfalls in the Commonwealth's budget. \"When social or economic legislation is at issue, the Equal Protection Clause allows the States wide latitude ... and the Constitution presumes that even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic processes.\" <i>City of Cleburne</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*459</span> <i>v. Cleburne Living Ctr.,</i> 473 U.S. 432, 440, 105 S.Ct. 3249, 87 L.Ed.2d 313 (1985) (internal citations omitted). Accordingly, in cases that do not involve a protected class, \"the Equal Protection Clause requires only a rational means to serve a legitimate end.\" <i>Id.</i> at 442, 105 S.Ct. 3249. Neither Law 230 nor Law 414 is directed to a protected class, and the Commonwealth's actions in transferring and using the funds, whatever their merit, is certainly rational, serving the legitimate end of balancing the budget. Thus, no equal protection violation occurred.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Qualified Immunity</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs additionally claim that the district court erred in finding that Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity as to Plaintiffs' claims for compensatory damages against the Defendants in their personal capacities under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. We review the district court's allowance of qualified immunity <i>de novo. </i><i>Jennings v. Jones,</i> 499 F.3d 2, 10 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>To determine qualified immunity, we have \"typically applied ... a three part test in which we inquire:\"</p>\n<blockquote>(1) whether the claimant has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged action or inaction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) if both of these questions are answered in the affirmative, whether an objectively reasonable official would have believed that the action taken violated that clearly established constitutional right.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto,</i> 253 F.3d 137, 141 (1st Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p>In its order the district court ultimately found that Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. As to the first prong, the district court found that Plaintiffs' amended complaint sufficiently alleged a due process claim and a takings claim with respect to the interest earned by the duplicate premiums, finding earlier that Plaintiffs' takings claim with respect to the duplicate premiums was not ripe. <i>García-Rubiera,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d at 192-93. However, as to the second prong, the district court relied upon our finding in <i>Flores Galarza</i> that \"after enactment of [Law 230], which specifically required the JUA to transfer to the Secretary all funds held in the Reserve as of December 31, 2001, the law did not clearly establish ... that <i>withholding any of the designated Reserve</i>... [and the interest it generates] was an unconstitutional taking.\" <i>Id.</i> at 193 (quoting <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 35) (emphasis in original). Moreover, the district court held that, \"[r]egarding Plaintiffs' procedural due process claim, the law was not clearly established that to the effect that the custodial transfer of funds pursuant to a Commonwealth statute and the provision of a compensation procedure did not comport with due process requirements.\" <i>Id.</i> at 193-94. As to the third prong, the district court relied upon our finding in <i>Flores Galarza</i> that \"a reasonable officer in [the Secretary's] circumstances would have believed that he had a law mandate, stemming from [Law 230], to retain for use by the Department of Treasury the Reserve Fund recognized by JUA as of December 31, 2001. Any officer in his shoes would have acted as he did in immediately retaining the full Reserve Fund [and interest] without any compensation to the JUA [or Plaintiffs].\" <i>Id.</i> at 194 (quoting <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 36) (alterations in the original). Accordingly, the district court concluded that \"[t]he same rationale applies to the takings and procedural due process claims asserted in this case.\" <i>Id.</i> Finally, the district court held that all of these findings applied equally to the Governor. <i>Id.</i> at 195.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*460</span> We identify no error in the district court's analysis, and see no reason to revisit anything we previously determined in <i>Flores Galarza.</i> We only add that the conclusions we reached in <i>Flores Galarza</i> apply equally to Plaintiffs' takings claims with respect to the duplicate premiums. <i>See </i><i>Pearson v. Callahan,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 129 S.Ct. 808, 818, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (establishment of constitutional violation unnecessary when other prongs are established in order to find qualified immunity). Accordingly, we affirm the district court with respect to its grant of qualified immunity to Defendants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Class Certification</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs finally challenge the denial of their motion to certify a class. We generally review the denial of class certification for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>McKenna v. First Horizon Home Loan Corp.,</i> 475 F.3d 418, 422 (1st Cir.2007). Any legal rulings are reviewed <i>de novo. </i><i>Tardiff v. Knox County,</i> 365 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Below, Plaintiffs moved to certify a class of \"all motor vehicle owners [sic] residents of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico who during the years 1997 to 2007 have paid the compulsory motor vehicle insurance premiums and have also acquired traditional insurance and have not been reimbursed with the compulsory insurance premiums.\" <i>García-Rubiera,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d at 198. The district court denied class certification because, having dismissed Plaintiffs' damage claims, the remaining claims for injunctive relief, if granted, would \"affect all commonwealth motor vehicle owners equally.\" <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, the district court concluded that \"[t]he class action device ... is not the superior method of adjudicating Plaintiffs' claims,\" since \"[c]lass certification in this case would serve no useful purpose.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>As an initial matter, although the district court did not directly address whether Plaintiffs satisfied the prerequisites of Rule 23(a), we note that they are easily satisfied here. As to numerosity, Plaintiffs estimate the class to be around 500,000, which they calculate based on the fact that JUA reserved amounts to reimburse on an estimate that 17% to 25% of all registered motor vehicle owners paid duplicate premiums, <i>see </i><i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 8-9, and that, according to Plaintiffs, there are three million registered motor vehicle owners. Although Plaintiffs do not provide a basis for their estimate of the total number of registered motor vehicle owners, we independently conclude that numerosity is satisfied. The money withheld by JUA for reimbursement ($20 million) as compared to the amount of the duplicate premiums ($99 or $148) paid by motor vehicle owners shows that the total number of individuals in the class far exceeds the low threshold for numerosity. <i>See </i><i>Stewart v. Abraham,</i> 275 F.3d 220, 226-27 (3d Cir.2001) (\"No minimum number of plaintiffs is required to maintain a suit as a class action, but generally if the named plaintiff demonstrates that the potential number of plaintiffs exceeds 40, the first prong of Rule 23(a) has been met.\") (citations omitted). Commonality and typicality are easily met as well, since there are \"questions of law or fact common to the class,\" <i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(a)(2), and Plaintiffs' claims \"arise[] from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members, and ... are based on the same legal theory.\" <i>See </i><i>In re Am. Med. Sys., Inc.,</i> 75 F.3d 1069, 1082 (6th Cir.1996) (discussing typicality under Rule 23(a)(3), quoting 1 Herbert B. Newberg &amp; Alba Conte, <i>Newberg on Class Actions</i> § 3.13 (3d ed.1992)). And there is no reason to question the adequacy of representation in this case, <i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4) &amp; 23(g), as Plaintiffs and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*461</span> counsel have diligently pursued their rights since enactment of Law 230.</p>\n<p>That said, the district court committed legal error in denying class certification. To obtain certification of a class, Plaintiffs must establish the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) and fall within one of the categories of Rule 23(b). <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(1)-(4) &amp; 23(b)(1)-(3); <i>see also </i><i>Smilow v. Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc.,</i> 323 F.3d 32, 38 (1st Cir.2003). In addressing Plaintiffs' motion to certify a class, the district court applied Rule 23(b)(3), which requires Plaintiffs to show, among other things, that \"a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). However, Rule 23(b)(3) applies to class actions solely asserting damage claims that do not otherwise fit within the other Rule 23(b) categories, <i>see </i><i>Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor,</i> 521 U.S. 591, 614-15, 117 S.Ct. 2231, 138 L.Ed.2d 689 (1997), and all damages claims in this case were dismissed. Instead, class actions asserting injunctive relief, as the one here, fit under Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief ... is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2); <i>see also </i><i>Robinson v. Metro-North Commuter R.R. Co.,</i> 267 F.3d 147, 162 (2d Cir.2001) (Rule 23(b)(2) \"is intended for cases where broad, class-wide injunctive or declaratory relief is necessary to redress a group-wide injury.\"). Unlike Rule 23(b)(3), Rule 23(b)(2) has no superiority requirement. Because the district court denied Plaintiffs' motion for class certification based on a requirement that did not apply, it committed reversible legal error.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we reverse the district court's denial of Plaintiffs' motion for class certification and, having found that Plaintiffs have satisfied all of the requirements necessary to certify a class, we direct the district court to certify one consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In sum, we reverse the district court and hold that Plaintiffs' takings claim for declaratory and injunctive relief is ripe. With respect to Plaintiffs' due process claim, we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We affirm the denial of Plaintiffs' equal protection claim. We affirm the district court's dismissal of Plaintiffs' compensatory damages claims on qualified immunity grounds. Finally, we reverse the district court's denial of class certification and remand directing the district court to certify a class consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed-in-part, reversed-in-part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</i> Each side shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  At the time of the filing of this action, Juan Antonio Flores-Galarza was Secretary and Sila María Calderón was Governor, although they no longer hold those positions. Because they were sued in their personal capacities, they remain parties to this action.</p>\n<p>[2]  Specifically, individuals who have \"the requisite amount of traditional liability insurance\" can \"avoid paying the compulsory insurance premium to the Secretary\" by presenting a \"Certificate of Compliance\" from their insurer. <i>Id.</i> at 7 n. 2.\n</p>\n<p>As noted in <i>Flores Galarza,</i> it is unclear whether <i>all</i> individuals who opt out by privately purchasing insurance can avoid paying the compulsory insurance premium at vehicle registration. That is because Puerto Rico law defines \"[t]raditional liability insurance\" as \"insurance protecting against both personal and property damage `resulting from or incident to ownership, maintenance, or use of any ... vehicle.'\" <i>Id.</i> (citing Law 253 and P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 407(1)). Accordingly, those who buy less than \"traditional liability insurance,\" but insurance sufficient to opt out of the compulsory insurance scheme, do not appear to be able to avoid paying the compulsory insurance premium at registration. We so concluded in <i>Flores Galarza, see id.</i> at 7 n. 3, although we do not need to address the issue here.</p>\n<p>[3]  In <i>Flores Galarza</i> JUA represented that from 1998 to 2001 it estimated that 25% \"of all vehicles were covered by policies from private insurers, and, accordingly, set aside 25% of all premiums received\" in the Reserve. <i>See id.</i> at 8. For fiscal year 2001, it reduced the amount reserved to approximately 17%. <i>Id.</i> at 8-9. <i>But see id.</i> at 11 n. 13 (noting discrepancy in percentages withheld).</p>\n<p>[4]  In fact, the $73 million was never transferred to JUA in the first place. As discussed in more detail in <i>Flores Galarza,</i> beginning in 2002, the Secretary refused to transfer the premiums it collected to JUA, a practice that ended when the parties reached a settlement in November 2002. 484 F.3d at 9-10. Pursuant to the settlement, the Secretary transferred to JUA all but $73 million, which was the amount Law 230 required JUA to retransfer back to the Secretary. <i>See generally id.</i> at 9-10.</p>\n<p>[5]  This conflicts with <i>Flores Galarza,</i> where the overstated amount was estimated to be between $8 million and $10 million. <i>See id.</i> at 8, 11 n. 13. The parties provide no explanation for this discrepancy, although Plaintiffs contend that the $8 million to $10 million amount is the correct one.</p>\n<p>[6]  In 2001, Plaintiffs filed a class action in the Commonwealth Court of First Instance seeking reimbursement from JUA. The action was dismissed for lack of primary jurisdiction, and on June 11, 2008, the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal. <i>See García Rubiera v. Asociación de Subscripción Conjunta del Seguro de Responsibilidad Obligatorio,</i> No. KLAN200700327, 2007 WL 5377629 (P.R. Cir. Jun. 11, 2007) (translation provided by the parties). In its decision the Court of Appeals held that Law 230 placed <i>exclusive</i> primary jurisdiction for any claims for reimbursement with the Secretary. Thus, Plaintiffs' failure to utilize Procedure No. 96 deprived the Court of First Instance jurisdiction to address their claims. <i>See id.</i> slip. op. at 16-19. The Court of Appeals did not address the merits of Plaintiffs' constitutional claims. <i>Id.</i> slip op. at 21.</p>\n<p>[7]  Plaintiffs amended the complaint on December 24, 2004 after the district court dismissed the original complaint without prejudice on February 9, 2004. The district court dismissed the complaint on standing and ripeness grounds. In essence, the district court found that Plaintiffs' claims were premature because \"it was uncertain\" that Law 230, then known as Bill 2114, would pass \"and the Commonwealth will in fact appropriate the funds for the 2002-2003 budget.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  Plaintiffs also seek reimbursement, but any claim for reimbursement against Defendants in their official capacities, to the extent that it is a claim for damages, is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <i>See </i><i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 23-25 &amp; n. 27.</p>\n<p>[9]  We further note that Defendants do not appeal the injunction entered by the district court with respect to the interest generated by the duplicate premiums. Since the basis of Plaintiffs' property interest in the interest is based on the maxim that \"`interest follows principal,'\" <i>see </i><i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 32 (quoting <i>Phillips,</i> 524 U.S. at 165-72, 118 S.Ct. 1925), it would be anomalous if Plaintiffs have a property interest in the interest generated by the duplicate premiums but not the premiums themselves.</p>\n<p>[10]  It is unclear whether Plaintiffs limit their takings challenge to solely a facial challenge. Plaintiffs' takings claim is not well-presented, and at times in their brief suggest such a limitation while, at the same time, they state that they are entitled to \"go to trial and present evidence that the procedure's net effect would have been to deprive the substantial majority of the owners of their reimbursement.\" Given this lack of clarity, we construe Plaintiffs' argument as presenting both facial and as-applied takings challenges.</p>\n<p>[11]  We note that Plaintiffs' due process claim only goes to the lack of notice of the <i>transfer</i> of the duplicate premiums to the Secretary pursuant to Law 230. Plaintiffs do not challenge the sufficiency of the notice post-transfer but prior to escheat.\n</p>\n<p>We further note that Puerto Rico's insurance code requires \"[e]very insurer and every general agent, manager, or producer\" to produce a report of all unclaimed premiums, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 2604(1), and \"cause notices to be published based on the information contained in the reports.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2605(1). Moreover, \"[s]uch notice must be published once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in Puerto Rico.\" <i>Id.</i> Presumably, \"general agent, manager, or producer\" includes the Secretary, but we do not need to address the matter here. <i>See id.</i> § 2612 (\"The provisions of this chapter shall prevail over the provisions of any other chapter present or future which may be in conflict herewith.\").</p>\n<p>[12]  The district court dismissed Plaintiffs' due process claims for compensatory damages on qualified immunity grounds, and we address the dismissal of those claims separately below.</p>\n<p>[13]  We speculate that one reason why the district court did not address this particular due process claim may be because Plaintiffs did not adequately present the claim below. However, Defendants do not assert waiver as a defense, and as both parties briefed the issue, we address it.</p>\n\n</div>",

The premiums, initially collected by the Secretary of the Treasury (the \"Secretary\"), are transferred to the Compulsory Liability Joint Underwriting Association of Puerto Rico (\"JUA\"), a Commonwealth-created association of all private insurers in Puerto Rico. JUA then provides the compulsory car insurance.</p>\n<p>Motor vehicle owners can opt out of the compulsory liability insurance scheme by privately purchasing insurance with the same or comparable coverage. Those owners who opt out can either avoid paying the uniform premium at vehicle registration or seek reimbursement of the \"duplicate premium\" paid.</p>\n<p>The amendments at issue in this appeal, Law 230 and Law 414, concern the duplicate premiums collected by JUA. In essence, the amendments mandate the transfer of funds designated by JUA for the reimbursement of duplicate premiums (plus the interest they generate) <i>back to</i> the Secretary for use by the Commonwealth to address budget shortfalls. Moreover, Law 230 promulgates a separate procedure, Procedure No. 96, to provide reimbursement.</p>\n<p>In 2002, the plaintiffs-appellants (the \"Plaintiffs\"), all owners of motor vehicles in Puerto Rico who privately purchased car insurance but paid duplicate premiums, filed suit against the Secretary and the Governor of the Commonwealth (the \"Governor\" and, together with the Secretary, the \"Defendants\") in their official and personal capacities.<sup>[1]</sup> Plaintiffs claim that Law 230 and Law 414 violate the Takings, Due Process, and Equal Protection Clauses. They sought declaratory relief, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, reimbursement, compensatory damages, and certification of a class of similarly situated vehicle owners. The district court denied almost all relief requested, including Plaintiffs' request for class certification. However, the district court granted a preliminary injunction, later made permanent, enjoining the transfer of the interest generated by the duplicate premiums and ordering the Commonwealth to develop an adequate scheme of reimbursement of that interest. This appeal followed. After careful consideration, we affirm-in-part, reverse-in-part, and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Our discussion of Law 253 and the amendments at issue in this appeal draw from, and incorporate by reference, our prior decisions concerning Law 253. <i>See </i><i>Asociación De Subscripción Conjunta Del Seguro De Responsibilidad Obligatorio v. Flores Galarza,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"797520\"><a href=\"/opinion/797520/asociacion-de-subscripcion-conjunta-del-seguro-de-responsabilidad/\"><span class=\"volume\">484</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span> (1st Cir.2007); <i>Arroyo-Melecio v.

Law 253</h2>\n<p>Law 253, codified at P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 8051-61, requires liability insurance coverage for all registered motor vehicles in Puerto Rico \"that travel on public thoroughfares.\" <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 6. To that end, Law 253 provides for compulsory liability insurance, \"`with $3000 of coverage for damages caused to third parties <span class=\"star-pagination\">*448</span> per accident in exchange for a uniform premium, initially set at $99 for each private passenger vehicle and $148 for each commercial vehicle.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Arroyo-Melecio,</i> 398 F.3d at 60-61). The compulsory liability insurance is provided by JUA, \"an association of all private insurers in Puerto Rico.\" <i>Id.</i> at 7. JUA must provide this coverage to all drivers, even high risk ones, with \"`the risk of insuring these high-risk drivers ... spread among all of the private insurers.'\" <i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Arroyo-Melecio,</i> 398 F.3d at 62).</p>\n<p>To fund the compulsory liability insurance, Law 253 requires motor vehicle owners to pay the uniform premium annually to the Secretary at the time of acquisition or renewal of vehicle registration. <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Arroyo-Melecio,</i> 398 F.3d at 61 n. 2). The Secretary then transfers the premiums periodically to JUA. <i>Id.</i> (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 8055(c)).</p>\n<p>Motor vehicle owners can \"opt out of the compulsory liability insurance scheme by privately purchasing liability insurance with comparable or better coverage.\" <i>See id.</i> at 7 (citing <i>Arroyo-Melecio,</i> 398 F.3d at 61 n. 2). Although, in some circumstances, individual motor vehicle owners who opt out can \"avoid paying the compulsory insurance premium to the Secretary\" at the time of registration, <i>see id.</i> at 7 n. 2, a number of such vehicle owners still pay the compulsory insurance premium.<sup>[2]</sup> For those owners, Law 253 provides for reimbursement; in particular, vehicle owners \"may then seek reimbursement directly from the JUA or from his insurer, who will, in turn, seek reimbursement from the JUA.\" <i>Id.</i> at 7. These procedures are not at issue in this appeal.</p>\n<p>\"Because a portion of the total amount of premiums received by JUA may be owed to third parties who seek refunds for duplicate payments,\" JUA is required by law to \"set aside these premiums and accumulate them in a separate reserve account (the `Reserve').\" <i>Id.</i> at 8. However, since January 1, 1998, the effective date of Law 253, JUA \"has been unable to determine exactly how many registered motor vehicles in Puerto Rico are covered by private liability insurance.\" <i>Id.</i> As a result, JUA has divided the Reserve account between the \"duplicate premiums\" it estimates it is required to reimburse to motor vehicle owners, and an \"overstated\" amount of funds, which are funds set aside by JUA as a buffer to meet all requests for reimbursement. <i>See id.</i> at 8-9.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The general provisions of Puerto Rico insurance law with respect to \"unclaimed funds\" apply to Law 253. <i>See id.</i> at 8 n. 5 (\"Puerto Rico's Insurance Code makes <span class=\"star-pagination\">*449</span> clear that this general provision applies to the compulsory liability insurance system under Law 253.\" (citing P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 2612)). Under Puerto Rico insurance law, vehicle owners have seven years to claim a duplicate premium. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 2603; <i>see also </i><i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 10 n. 9. Otherwise, the duplicate premium escheats to the Commonwealth.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Law 230 and Law 414</h2>\n<p>On September 11, 2002, the Puerto Rican legislature enacted Law 230, codified at P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 8055(<i>l</i>). Law 230 requires JUA to <i>retransfer</i> to the Secretary all funds held in the Reserve every two years to balance the Commonwealth's budget. The first transfer mandated under Law 230, $73 million, occurred the same month of Law 230's enactment.<sup>[4]</sup> Law 230 also provided that the Commonwealth could spend $53 million of the funds immediately. The $53 million, according to the Statement of Motives of the subsequently enacted Law 414, corresponded to the overstated funds contained in the Reserve.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p>Under Law 230, the remaining $20 million, an estimate of the actual duplicate premiums paid, remained in the custody of the Secretary as trustee for five years, after which all unclaimed duplicate premiums became the property of the Commonwealth. However, any income generated by the funds, such as interest, reverted to the Commonwealth's General Fund as it accrued.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, under Law 230, \"the seven-year period provided by the general provisions of Puerto Rico's Insurance Code ... [is divided] among the JUA (which holds the funds for two years) and the Secretary (who holds the funds for five additional years), after which time the funds lapse to the general fund.\" <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 10 n. 9.</p>\n<p>Pursuant to Law 230, the Secretary adopted Procedure No. 96, a procedure by which motor vehicle owners can seek reimbursement from the Secretary. To obtain reimbursement, a vehicle owner must fill out a model form and submit, via mail or at certain designated offices, the following:</p>\n<blockquote>a. Copy of the Motor Vehicle Registration License for which such reimbursement is being claimed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>b. Copy of the insurance policy. Said policy shall be for each year that is being claimed;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>c. In the case such that it is the insurance firm which is making the claim, it shall attach certified copies of those policies that it is claiming;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>d. Certification of payment of the policy for each year being claimed. Such certification shall be issued by the insurance firm;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>e. Certification that such insurance firm has not received any reimbursement from [JUA], nor has reimbursed the premium for the Mandatory Liability Insurance, to the insured party.</blockquote>\n<p>According to the Statement of Motives of Law 414, the Secretary has only reimbursed <span class=\"star-pagination\">*450</span> approximately $500,000 of duplicate premiums in the first two years of the enactment of Law 230.</p>\n<p>On September 22, 2004, the legislature passed Law 414, also codified at P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 8055(1). Among other things, Law 414 permitted the Commonwealth to use $19 million of the remaining funds transferred in September 2002 to balance the 2004-05 fiscal year budget. Law 414 also requires the Commonwealth to use money from the General Fund and the Budgetary Fund to reimburse vehicle owners if the amount transferred by JUA every two years is not sufficient to satisfy reimbursement requests.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Procedural History</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs are motor vehicle owners who privately purchased liability insurance but also paid duplicate premiums. On February 6, 2002, in anticipation of the passage of Law 230, Plaintiffs filed a complaint in district court seeking equitable relief and damages under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs refuse to seek reimbursement from the Secretary through Procedure No. 96.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>In their complaint, which has been amended,<sup>[7]</sup> Plaintiffs assert a property interest in the duplicate premiums and the interest they generate. Consequently, Plaintiffs contend that each transfer of the funds from the Reserve account to the Secretary, starting with the $73 million in September of 2002, constitutes a temporary physical appropriation of their property without compensation and without due process, in violation of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. They also contend that the Secretary permanently, and unlawfully, appropriated the interest generated by the funds. Finally, they contend that, as payers of the duplicate premiums, they and others similarly situated were singled out by the Commonwealth to address its budget concerns, in violation of the Equal Protection Clause.</p>\n<blockquote>Plaintiffs sought</blockquote>\n<blockquote>1. a declaratory judgment that the Governor \"cannot implement\" Laws 230 and 414;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>2. a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent the transfer of funds from the Reserve to the Secretary;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>3. $70 million in damages from the Secretary and the Governor in their personal capacities; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>4. costs and attorneys' fees.<sup>[8]</sup></blockquote>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*451</span> Plaintiffs also sought to certify a class. The Governor and the Secretary each moved to dismiss the claims, claiming, among other things, qualified immunity. Plaintiffs opposed, and moved separately for a preliminary injunction and class certification.</p>\n<p>On August 30, 2007, the district court issued an opinion and order that addressed these various motions. <i>García-Rubiera v. Flores-Galarza,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1578618\"><a href=\"/opinion/1578618/garcia-rubiera-v-flores-galarza/\"><span class=\"volume\">516</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span> (D.P.R.2007). In the order, the district court dismissed as unripe the takings claim with respect to the duplicate premiums, since Plaintiffs had not availed themselves of their administrative remedy under Procedure No. 96. <i>Id.</i> at 188-90. The order also dismissed Plaintiffs' damages claims against the Secretary and the Treasurer in their personal capacities, finding that both were entitled to qualified immunity. <i>Id.</i> at 194-95. The district court further denied preliminary injunctive relief that would have prevented the Commonwealth from taking title to those duplicate premiums transferred in September 2002, which were scheduled to escheat to the Commonwealth in September 2007. <i>Id.</i> at 195-96. The district court also denied Plaintiffs' motion for class certification. <i>Id.</i> at 198. However, the district court granted a preliminary injunction, made permanent, that enjoined Defendants from depositing into the General Fund any interest generated by the duplicate premiums. <i>Id.</i> at 196-98 &amp; n. 20.</p>\n<p>The district court later entered a separate judgment setting forth the terms of the permanent injunction, whereby it retained jurisdiction until the Commonwealth instituted a constitutionally adequate scheme \"to deal with the interest generated by the Duplicate Premiums.\" It further stated that \"[j]udgment is also entered dismissing all claims against [the Secretary] and [the Governor] in their personal capacities.\" Plaintiffs now appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs raise several issues on appeal. We discuss each in turn.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. The Takings Claim</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs first argue that the district court erred by dismissing their Takings Clause claim with respect to the duplicate premiums as unripe because of Plaintiffs' refusal to pursue their administrative remedy under Procedure No. 96. As discussed in more detail below, we disagree with the district court and conclude that Plaintiffs' takings claim for declaratory and injunctive relief is ripe despite their failure to utilize Procedure No. 96.</p>\n<p>We review <i>de novo</i> the dismissal of a takings claim on ripeness grounds. <i>Deniz v. Municipality of Guaynabo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199916\"><a href=\"/opinion/199916/deniz-marquez-v-guaynabo-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">285</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">142</span></a></span>, 145 (1st Cir.2002).

First, Plaintiffs have a sufficient property interest in the duplicate premiums to support their takings claim. For purposes of the Takings Clause, \"the existence of a property interest is determined by reference to `existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.'\" <i>See </i><i>Phillips v. Wash. Legal Found.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118226\"><a href=\"/opinion/118226/phillips-v-washington-legal-foundation/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">156</span></a></span>, 164, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118226\"><a href=\"/opinion/118226/phillips-v-washington-legal-foundation/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">548</span></a></span> (1972)). Here, Puerto Rico law plainly establishes that Plaintiffs have a sufficient property interest in the duplicate premiums. By regulation, JUA must segregate those premiums collected that are thought to be duplicate premiums, and Puerto Rico's insurance law concerning \"unclaimed funds\" apply to the duplicate premiums collected. <i>See </i><i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 8 &amp; n. 5. Furthermore, upon transfer to the Secretary, Law 230 requires the Secretary to hold the duplicate premiums in a fiduciary capacity. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, §§ 8055(1) (\"The Secretary of the Treasury shall retain these funds as <i>trustee</i> ....\") (emphasis added). Finally, Law 253, Law 230, and Law 414 all provide for reimbursement of the duplicate premiums. Thus, like funds held in trust in an IOLTA account or an interpleader account, the funds held by JUA or the Secretary are clearly the \"private property\" of Plaintiffs for purposes of the Takings Clause. <i>See </i><i>Phillips,</i> 524 U.S. at 164, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118226\"><a href=\"/opinion/118226/phillips-v-washington-legal-foundation/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3108</span></a></span>) (emphasis added). As we stated in <i>Flores Galarza,</i></p>\n<blockquote>The case law addressing the first \"hurdle\" focuses on whether the administrative body responsible for applying the challenged regulations has completed discretionary review of the plaintiff's particular situation. Here, there is no pending administrative process that could, through a variance, waiver or other discretionary decision, modify the statute's impact on the JUA.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> at 15. The same is true here, as there is no pending process that would \"modify the statute's impact\" on Plaintiffs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>The Just Compensation Prong</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Consequently, at issue is whether Plaintiffs have satisfied the second, \"just compensation\" prong. The just compensation prong presents some difficulty for Plaintiffs, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*453</span> since Procedure No. 96 provides a procedure to reimburse the duplicate premiums, and Plaintiffs refuse to avail themselves of it. By their own admission, Plaintiffs have not \"sought compensation through the procedures the State has provided for doing so.\" <i>Id.</i> at 14 (citations omitted); <i>see also </i><i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 197, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111501\"><a href=\"/opinion/111501/williamson-county-regional-planning-commn-v-hamilton-bank-of-johnson-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3108</span></a></span> (holding that the takings claim in that case was unripe \"until [the plaintiff] has utilized th[e] procedure\" for just compensation provided by the state). For that reason, the district court dismissed Plaintiffs' claim as unripe. <i>See </i><i>García-Rubiera,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d at 190.</p>\n<p>However, we have recognized exceptions to the just compensation prong. We have noted that facial challenges to a regulation \"are generally ripe the moment the challenged regulation or ordinance is passed.\" <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 14 (quoting <i>Suitum,</i> 520 U.S. at 736 n. 10, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118116\"><a href=\"/opinion/118116/suitum-v-tahoe-regional-planning-agency/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1659</span></a></span>). Moreover, we have held that a plaintiff is relieved of the second prong if the procedure is \"unavailable,\" \"inadequate,\" or \"futile.\" <i>See id.</i> (noting that second prong does not apply when a procedure is \"unavailable or inadequate\" (quoting <i>Williamson County,</i> 473 U.S. at 197, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111501\"><a href=\"/opinion/111501/williamson-county-regional-planning-commn-v-hamilton-bank-of-johnson-city/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The Due Process Claim</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs also contend that Law 230 violates the Due Process Clause because it is a \"spurious escheat statute\" that transfers the duplicate premiums to the Commonwealth without providing notice of the transfers. Specifically, Plaintiffs challenge the transfer of the Reserve account from JUA every two years to balance the budget, which they contend effects an \"escheat\" of the premiums to the Commonwealth in violation of Puerto Rico law, which requires seven years of abandonment before the Commonwealth can take over the funds. <i>See</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 2603; <i>id.</i> § 2612 (\"The [general provision governing unclaimed funds] shall prevail over the provisions of any other chapter present or future which may be in conflict herewith.\"). Plaintiffs argue that because Law 230 \"did not provide any notice to the persons who might have an interest in\" the transferred duplicate premiums, it violates their due process rights.<sup>[11]</sup></p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*455</span> As discussed in more detail below, although we agree with Plaintiffs that they have a sufficient property interest in the duplicate premiums for purposes of due process, we remand for further proceedings to determine whether the transfers to the Secretary constitutes a sufficient deprivation of that property interest to require notice under the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. <i>Relevant Procedural Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The district court did not directly address this specific due process challenge with respect to Plaintiffs' claim for equitable relief.<sup>[12]</sup> As background, the district court denied Plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunctive relief based on their due process claims because Plaintiffs failed to assert a likelihood of success on the merits. <i>García-Rubiera,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d at 196. The district court found that Plaintiffs \"have not shown that available remedies under the Commonwealth law are inadequate to redress any deprivation resulting from the transfer of the Duplicate Premiums to the Secretary;\" specifically, Plaintiffs failed to \"make [an] evidentiary proffer to support their allegations that Procedure No. 96 is onerous and `difficult if not impossible.'\" <i>Id.</i> (citing <i>Rumford Pharmacy, Inc. v.

The district court further noted that since \"Plaintiffs appear to have an adequate remedy at law which they have elected not to pursue,\" they \"will not ... suffer irreparable injury if denied equitable relief.\" <i>Id.</i> The district court proceeded to enter a preliminary injunction, which it later made permanent, only as to Plaintiffs' claims with respect to the interest earned by the duplicate premiums. <i>Id.</i> at 197. Left unaddressed was Plaintiffs' due process claim with respect to notice. The district court instead focused on Plaintiffs' claim that Procedure No. 96 was \"onerous.\"<sup>[13]</sup><i>Id.</i> at 196.</p>\n<p>In fact, although the district court denied preliminary injunctive relief with respect to the duplicate premiums, the court never explicitly disposed of Plaintiffs' due process claim. After denying preliminary injunctive relief, the district court proceeded to enter a final judgment setting forth the terms of the permanent injunction as to the interest generated by the duplicate premiums, and further stated that \"[j]udgment is also entered dismissing all claims against [Defendants] in their personal capacities.\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. <i>Analysis</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Since Plaintiffs challenge the district court's denial of preliminary injunctive relief, \"`we scrutinize abstract legal matters <i>de novo,</i> findings of fact for clear error, and judgment calls with considerable deference to the trier.'\" <i>See </i><i>Waterproofing Sys., Inc. v.

Plaintiffs instead claim that, on its face, Law 230 provides <i>no</i> notice of the transfer of the duplicate premiums from JUA to the Secretary every two years. Based upon our own review of Law 230 and Procedure No. 96, we agree. Law 230 makes no mention of notice. Instead, Law 230 only directs that the funds in the Reserve account be transferred to the Secretary. Procedure No. 96 also fails to provide notice. It provides that a reimbursement claim can be made \"through the Public Insurance Area through Form SC-4601, Request for Reimbursement of Mandatory Insurance,\" and that \"[s]ame shall be available in the Internet or at Collector's Offices.\" Procedure No. 96 also sets forth the proof necessary to file a successful reimbursement claim. Despite all of these provisions, no mention of notice is made. The closest Procedure No. 96 comes to indicating notice is a direction that, upon transfer, JUA \"shall forward an electronic file ... which shall contain the information which is indicated in Attachment 1, bearing those insureds that are entitled to such reimbursement.\" Procedure No. 96, however, does not further direct that those named insureds receive <i>notice</i> of the transfer.</p>\n<p>In response, Defendants argue, without citing any supporting authority, that Plaintiffs had \"plenty of notice\" because they filed this action prior to the enactment of Law 230. However, Plaintiffs' actual notice has no bearing in this case because Plaintiffs assert a facial challenge to Law 230. Plaintiffs argue that Law 230 is unconstitutional on its face because it fails to include a process whereby motor vehicle owners who paid duplicate premiums are provided notice that their premiums are going to be transferred to, and held by, the Secretary. Defendants do not dispute the absence of such a provision. Thus, actual notice cannot defeat Plaintiffs' due process claim.</p>\n<p>Defendants also argue, again without citing supporting authority, that the mere passage and publication of Law 230 provided notice of the transfers of the duplicate premiums and the mechanism by which the payers of duplicate premiums could seek reimbursement. However, Plaintiffs' argument is not that due process required them to receive notice of the available procedure for obtaining reimbursement. <i>See </i><i>City of West Covina v.

Plaintiffs have demonstrated such an interest. In general, we perform the same analysis in determining whether a property interest is sufficient under both the Takings Clause and the Due Process Clause. <i>See </i><i>Picard v.

In this case, the alleged deprivation caused by Law 230the transfer of the duplicate premiums to the Secretarydoes not cause a permanent escheat. Instead, the funds are to be held in trust by the Secretary until the escheat period set forth under Puerto Rico insurance law passes.</p>\n<p>The Supreme Court has held that \"even the temporary or partial impairments to property rights that attachments, liens, and similar encumbrances entail are sufficient to merit due process protection.\" <i>See </i><i>Connecticut v.

In <i>Doehr,</i> for example, a Connecticut statute permitted plaintiffs in civil suits to obtain ex parte attachments against defendants with a showing so minimalan averment by the plaintiff that the defendant is liablethat it resulted in a \"significant risk of erroneous deprivation.\" <i>Id.</i> at 21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112615\"><a href=\"/opinion/112615/connecticut-v-doehr/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2105</span></a></span>. Following <i>Doehr,</i> in <i>Reardon v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"571246\"><a href=\"/opinion/571246/paul-d-reardon-and-john-e-reardon-v-united-states-of-america-and-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1509</span></a></span> (1st Cir. 1991) (en banc), we held that filing a CERCLA lien without notice or a pre-deprivation proceeding constituted a sufficient deprivation of property since \"[t]he EPA's lien has substantially the same effect... as the attachment had on the [property owner] in <i>Doehr</i>clouding title, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*458</span> limiting alienability, [and] affecting current and potential mortgages.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1518.</p>\n<p>The alleged deprivation caused by Law 230 has some similarities to the \"temporary or partial\" deprivations in <i>Doehr</i> and <i>Reardon.</i> Like a lien or attachment, the alleged deprivation in this case is \"temporary or partial,\" because Law 230 allows payers of the duplicate premiums to receive reimbursement. The deprivation here, like in <i>Doehr</i> and <i>Reardon,</i> only results in a \"risk of erroneous deprivation.\" <i>Doehr,</i> 501 U.S. at 21, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112615\"><a href=\"/opinion/112615/connecticut-v-doehr/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2105</span></a></span>. Moreover, like a lien or attachment, the Secretary, through operation of Puerto Rico's general escheat statute, has a contingent interest in the duplicate premiums, one that poses a risk of complete deprivation should Plaintiffs fail to obtain reimbursement during the escheat period.</p>\n<p>But the alleged deprivation in this case differs from the deprivations in <i>Doehr</i> and <i>Reardon</i> in two important respects. First, unlike in <i>Doehr</i> or <i>Reardon,</i> Plaintiffs do not have use of the duplicate premiums prior to the transfer, as they are already held in trust by JUA. The transfers only result in a change of trustees. Second, the laws at issue in <i>Doehr</i> and <i>Reardon created</i> the liens or attachments at issue without adequate due process. In this case, however, the Secretary already has a contingent interest prior to the transfer, insofar as the escheat period had already begun to run prior to the transfer. The only change effected by the transfer, apart from the change in trustee, is the change in procedure to obtain reimbursement. In sum, the alleged deprivation here is not the creation of a lien or attachment without due process, as was the case in <i>Doehr</i> and <i>Reardon,</i> but the transfer of property held by one party to a <i>different</i> party and the imposition of a different (and allegedly more onerous) reimbursement procedure.</p>\n<p>In their takings claim, Plaintiffs claim that the procedure to obtain reimbursement, Procedure No. 96, is so onerous that the change in procedure is, in effect, a \"spurious escheat.\" Here, they also claim that the transfer constitutes a \"spurious escheat,\" but provide no briefing on whether the alleged deprivation (change in trustee plus a change in procedure) constitutes a sufficient deprivation for purposes of the Due Process Clause. Defendants also provide no briefing on whether the transfers here result in a deprivation of constitutional significance. They only argue that any notice here was adequate. Finally, as noted above, the district court did not reach the issue.</p>\n<p>Given the lack of briefing and the district court's silence on this issue, we conclude that the more prudent course is to remand to the district court for further proceedings to determine whether the transfers of the duplicate premiums mandated by Law 230 constitute a sufficient deprivation for purposes of the Due Process Clause.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. The Equal Protection Claim</h2>\n<p>In addition to their due process challenge, Plaintiffs contend that the district court erred with respect to their equal protection claim. The district court dismissed the claim in a footnote, stating that it \"finds without merit Plaintiffs' undeveloped arguments that the Secretary's action ... violates their rights to equal protection.\" <i>García-Rubiera,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d at 188 n. 10.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs fare no better here. Plaintiffs claim that they were \"singled out\" as payers of the duplicate premiums to address the shortfalls in the Commonwealth's budget. \"When social or economic legislation is at issue, the Equal Protection Clause allows the States wide latitude ... and the Constitution presumes that even improvident decisions will eventually be rectified by the democratic processes.\" <i>City of Cleburne</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*459</span> <i>v. Cleburne Living Ctr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">473</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">432</span></a></span>, 440, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">313</span></a></span> (1985) (internal citations omitted). Accordingly, in cases that do not involve a protected class, \"the Equal Protection Clause requires only a rational means to serve a legitimate end.\" <i>Id.</i> at 442, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111507\"><a href=\"/opinion/111507/cleburne-v-cleburne-living-center-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">3249</span></a></span>. Neither Law 230 nor Law 414 is directed to a protected class, and the Commonwealth's actions in transferring and using the funds, whatever their merit, is certainly rational, serving the legitimate end of balancing the budget. Thus, no equal protection violation occurred.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Qualified Immunity</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs additionally claim that the district court erred in finding that Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity as to Plaintiffs' claims for compensatory damages against the Defendants in their personal capacities under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. We review the district court's allowance of qualified immunity <i>de novo. </i><i>Jennings v. Jones,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">499</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">2</span></span>, 10 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>To determine qualified immunity, we have \"typically applied ... a three part test in which we inquire:\"</p>\n<blockquote>(1) whether the claimant has alleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right;</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(2) whether the right was clearly established at the time of the alleged action or inaction; and</blockquote>\n<blockquote>(3) if both of these questions are answered in the affirmative, whether an objectively reasonable official would have believed that the action taken violated that clearly established constitutional right.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Starlight Sugar, Inc. v. Soto,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199435\"><a href=\"/opinion/199435/soto-v-sugar-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">253</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">137</span></a></span>, 141 (1st Cir.2001)).</p>\n<p>In its order the district court ultimately found that Defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. As to the first prong, the district court found that Plaintiffs' amended complaint sufficiently alleged a due process claim and a takings claim with respect to the interest earned by the duplicate premiums, finding earlier that Plaintiffs' takings claim with respect to the duplicate premiums was not ripe. <i>García-Rubiera,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d at 192-93. However, as to the second prong, the district court relied upon our finding in <i>Flores Galarza</i> that \"after enactment of [Law 230], which specifically required the JUA to transfer to the Secretary all funds held in the Reserve as of December 31, 2001, the law did not clearly establish ... that <i>withholding any of the designated Reserve</i>... [and the interest it generates] was an unconstitutional taking.\" <i>Id.</i> at 193 (quoting <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 35) (emphasis in original). Moreover, the district court held that, \"[r]egarding Plaintiffs' procedural due process claim, the law was not clearly established that to the effect that the custodial transfer of funds pursuant to a Commonwealth statute and the provision of a compensation procedure did not comport with due process requirements.\" <i>Id.</i> at 193-94. As to the third prong, the district court relied upon our finding in <i>Flores Galarza</i> that \"a reasonable officer in [the Secretary's] circumstances would have believed that he had a law mandate, stemming from [Law 230], to retain for use by the Department of Treasury the Reserve Fund recognized by JUA as of December 31, 2001. Any officer in his shoes would have acted as he did in immediately retaining the full Reserve Fund [and interest] without any compensation to the JUA [or Plaintiffs].\" <i>Id.</i> at 194 (quoting <i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 36) (alterations in the original). Accordingly, the district court concluded that \"[t]he same rationale applies to the takings and procedural due process claims asserted in this case.\" <i>Id.</i> Finally, the district court held that all of these findings applied equally to the Governor. <i>Id.</i> at 195.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*460</span> We identify no error in the district court's analysis, and see no reason to revisit anything we previously determined in <i>Flores Galarza.</i> We only add that the conclusions we reached in <i>Flores Galarza</i> apply equally to Plaintiffs' takings claims with respect to the duplicate premiums. <i>See </i><i>Pearson v. Callahan,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145918\"><a href=\"/opinion/145918/pearson-v-callahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">129</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">808</span></a></span>, 818, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145918\"><a href=\"/opinion/145918/pearson-v-callahan/\"><span class=\"volume\">172</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span> (2009) (establishment of constitutional violation unnecessary when other prongs are established in order to find qualified immunity). Accordingly, we affirm the district court with respect to its grant of qualified immunity to Defendants.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. Class Certification</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs finally challenge the denial of their motion to certify a class. We generally review the denial of class certification for abuse of discretion. <i>See </i><i>McKenna v. First Horizon Home Loan Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202614\"><a href=\"/opinion/202614/mckenna-v-first-horizon/\"><span class=\"volume\">475</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">418</span></a></span>, 422 (1st Cir.2007). Any legal rulings are reviewed <i>de novo. </i><i>Tardiff v. Knox County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200960\"><a href=\"/opinion/200960/tardiff-v-knox-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 4 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n<p>Below, Plaintiffs moved to certify a class of \"all motor vehicle owners [sic] residents of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico who during the years 1997 to 2007 have paid the compulsory motor vehicle insurance premiums and have also acquired traditional insurance and have not been reimbursed with the compulsory insurance premiums.\" <i>García-Rubiera,</i> 516 F.Supp.2d at 198. The district court denied class certification because, having dismissed Plaintiffs' damage claims, the remaining claims for injunctive relief, if granted, would \"affect all commonwealth motor vehicle owners equally.\" <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, the district court concluded that \"[t]he class action device ... is not the superior method of adjudicating Plaintiffs' claims,\" since \"[c]lass certification in this case would serve no useful purpose.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>As an initial matter, although the district court did not directly address whether Plaintiffs satisfied the prerequisites of Rule 23(a), we note that they are easily satisfied here. As to numerosity, Plaintiffs estimate the class to be around 500,000, which they calculate based on the fact that JUA reserved amounts to reimburse on an estimate that 17% to 25% of all registered motor vehicle owners paid duplicate premiums, <i>see </i><i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 8-9, and that, according to Plaintiffs, there are three million registered motor vehicle owners. Although Plaintiffs do not provide a basis for their estimate of the total number of registered motor vehicle owners, we independently conclude that numerosity is satisfied. The money withheld by JUA for reimbursement ($20 million) as compared to the amount of the duplicate premiums ($99 or $148) paid by motor vehicle owners shows that the total number of individuals in the class far exceeds the low threshold for numerosity. <i>See </i><i>Stewart v. Abraham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775965\"><a href=\"/opinion/775965/robert-stewart-on-behalf-of-himself-and-all-others-similarly-situated-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">275</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 226-27 (3d Cir.2001) (\"No minimum number of plaintiffs is required to maintain a suit as a class action, but generally if the named plaintiff demonstrates that the potential number of plaintiffs exceeds 40, the first prong of Rule 23(a) has been met.\") (citations omitted). Commonality and typicality are easily met as well, since there are \"questions of law or fact common to the class,\" <i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(a)(2), and Plaintiffs' claims \"arise[] from the same event or practice or course of conduct that gives rise to the claims of other class members, and ... are based on the same legal theory.\" <i>See </i><i>In re Am. Med. Sys., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"712195\"><a href=\"/opinion/712195/in-re-american-medical-systems-inc-pfizer-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1069</span></a></span>, 1082 (6th Cir.1996) (discussing typicality under Rule 23(a)(3), quoting 1 Herbert B. Newberg &amp; Alba Conte, <i>Newberg on Class Actions</i> § 3.13 (3d ed.1992)). And there is no reason to question the adequacy of representation in this case, <i>see</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. 23(a)(4) &amp; 23(g), as Plaintiffs and <span class=\"star-pagination\">*461</span> counsel have diligently pursued their rights since enactment of Law 230.</p>\n<p>That said, the district court committed legal error in denying class certification. To obtain certification of a class, Plaintiffs must establish the prerequisites of Rule 23(a) and fall within one of the categories of Rule 23(b). <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(a)(1)-(4) &amp; 23(b)(1)-(3); <i>see also </i><i>Smilow v. Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200373\"><a href=\"/opinion/200373/smilow-v-southwestern-bell/\"><span class=\"volume\">323</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">32</span></a></span>, 38 (1st Cir.2003). In addressing Plaintiffs' motion to certify a class, the district court applied Rule 23(b)(3), which requires Plaintiffs to show, among other things, that \"a class action is superior to other available methods for fairly and efficiently adjudicating the controversy.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(3). However, Rule 23(b)(3) applies to class actions solely asserting damage claims that do not otherwise fit within the other Rule 23(b) categories, <i>see </i><i>Amchem Prods., Inc. v. Windsor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118142\"><a href=\"/opinion/118142/amchem-products-inc-v-windsor/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">591</span></a></span>, 614-15, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118142\"><a href=\"/opinion/118142/amchem-products-inc-v-windsor/\"><span class=\"volume\">117</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">689</span></a></span> (1997), and all damages claims in this case were dismissed. Instead, class actions asserting injunctive relief, as the one here, fit under Rule 23(b)(2), which applies when \"the party opposing the class has acted or refused to act on grounds that apply generally to the class, so that final injunctive relief ... is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 23(b)(2); <i>see also </i><i>Robinson v. Metro-North Commuter R.R. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775110\"><a href=\"/opinion/775110/charles-robinson-sharon-e-mack-james-oliver-darryll-f-simpson-veronica/\"><span class=\"volume\">267</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 162 (2d Cir.2001) (Rule 23(b)(2) \"is intended for cases where broad, class-wide injunctive or declaratory relief is necessary to redress a group-wide injury.\"). Unlike Rule 23(b)(3), Rule 23(b)(2) has no superiority requirement. Because the district court denied Plaintiffs' motion for class certification based on a requirement that did not apply, it committed reversible legal error.</p>\n<p>Accordingly, we reverse the district court's denial of Plaintiffs' motion for class certification and, having found that Plaintiffs have satisfied all of the requirements necessary to certify a class, we direct the district court to certify one consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>In sum, we reverse the district court and hold that Plaintiffs' takings claim for declaratory and injunctive relief is ripe. With respect to Plaintiffs' due process claim, we remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. We affirm the denial of Plaintiffs' equal protection claim. We affirm the district court's dismissal of Plaintiffs' compensatory damages claims on qualified immunity grounds. Finally, we reverse the district court's denial of class certification and remand directing the district court to certify a class consistent with this opinion.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed-in-part, reversed-in-part, and remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.</i> Each side shall bear their own costs.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the District of New Hampshire, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  At the time of the filing of this action, Juan Antonio Flores-Galarza was Secretary and Sila María Calderón was Governor, although they no longer hold those positions. Because they were sued in their personal capacities, they remain parties to this action.</p>\n<p>[2]  Specifically, individuals who have \"the requisite amount of traditional liability insurance\" can \"avoid paying the compulsory insurance premium to the Secretary\" by presenting a \"Certificate of Compliance\" from their insurer. <i>Id.</i> at 7 n. 2.\n</p>\n<p>As noted in <i>Flores Galarza,</i> it is unclear whether <i>all</i> individuals who opt out by privately purchasing insurance can avoid paying the compulsory insurance premium at vehicle registration. That is because Puerto Rico law defines \"[t]raditional liability insurance\" as \"insurance protecting against both personal and property damage `resulting from or incident to ownership, maintenance, or use of any ... vehicle.'\" <i>Id.</i> (citing Law 253 and P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 407(1)). Accordingly, those who buy less than \"traditional liability insurance,\" but insurance sufficient to opt out of the compulsory insurance scheme, do not appear to be able to avoid paying the compulsory insurance premium at registration. We so concluded in <i>Flores Galarza, see id.</i> at 7 n. 3, although we do not need to address the issue here.</p>\n<p>[3]  In <i>Flores Galarza</i> JUA represented that from 1998 to 2001 it estimated that 25% \"of all vehicles were covered by policies from private insurers, and, accordingly, set aside 25% of all premiums received\" in the Reserve. <i>See id.</i> at 8. For fiscal year 2001, it reduced the amount reserved to approximately 17%. <i>Id.</i> at 8-9. <i>But see id.</i> at 11 n. 13 (noting discrepancy in percentages withheld).</p>\n<p>[4]  In fact, the $73 million was never transferred to JUA in the first place. As discussed in more detail in <i>Flores Galarza,</i> beginning in 2002, the Secretary refused to transfer the premiums it collected to JUA, a practice that ended when the parties reached a settlement in November 2002. 484 F.3d at 9-10. Pursuant to the settlement, the Secretary transferred to JUA all but $73 million, which was the amount Law 230 required JUA to retransfer back to the Secretary. <i>See generally id.</i> at 9-10.</p>\n<p>[5]  This conflicts with <i>Flores Galarza,</i> where the overstated amount was estimated to be between $8 million and $10 million. <i>See id.</i> at 8, 11 n. 13. The parties provide no explanation for this discrepancy, although Plaintiffs contend that the $8 million to $10 million amount is the correct one.</p>\n<p>[6]  In 2001, Plaintiffs filed a class action in the Commonwealth Court of First Instance seeking reimbursement from JUA. The action was dismissed for lack of primary jurisdiction, and on June 11, 2008, the Puerto Rico Court of Appeals upheld the dismissal. <i>See García Rubiera v. Asociación de Subscripción Conjunta del Seguro de Responsibilidad Obligatorio,</i> No. KLAN200700327, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2007</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">5377629</span></span> (P.R. Cir. Jun. 11, 2007) (translation provided by the parties). In its decision the Court of Appeals held that Law 230 placed <i>exclusive</i> primary jurisdiction for any claims for reimbursement with the Secretary. Thus, Plaintiffs' failure to utilize Procedure No. 96 deprived the Court of First Instance jurisdiction to address their claims. <i>See id.</i> slip. op. at 16-19. The Court of Appeals did not address the merits of Plaintiffs' constitutional claims. <i>Id.</i> slip op. at 21.</p>\n<p>[7]  Plaintiffs amended the complaint on December 24, 2004 after the district court dismissed the original complaint without prejudice on February 9, 2004. The district court dismissed the complaint on standing and ripeness grounds. In essence, the district court found that Plaintiffs' claims were premature because \"it was uncertain\" that Law 230, then known as Bill 2114, would pass \"and the Commonwealth will in fact appropriate the funds for the 2002-2003 budget.\"</p>\n<p>[8]  Plaintiffs also seek reimbursement, but any claim for reimbursement against Defendants in their official capacities, to the extent that it is a claim for damages, is barred by the Eleventh Amendment. <i>See </i><i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 23-25 &amp; n. 27.</p>\n<p>[9]  We further note that Defendants do not appeal the injunction entered by the district court with respect to the interest generated by the duplicate premiums. Since the basis of Plaintiffs' property interest in the interest is based on the maxim that \"`interest follows principal,'\" <i>see </i><i>Flores Galarza,</i> 484 F.3d at 32 (quoting <i>Phillips,</i> 524 U.S. at 165-72, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118226\"><a href=\"/opinion/118226/phillips-v-washington-legal-foundation/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1925</span></a></span>), it would be anomalous if Plaintiffs have a property interest in the interest generated by the duplicate premiums but not the premiums themselves.</p>\n<p>[10]  It is unclear whether Plaintiffs limit their takings challenge to solely a facial challenge. Plaintiffs' takings claim is not well-presented, and at times in their brief suggest such a limitation while, at the same time, they state that they are entitled to \"go to trial and present evidence that the procedure's net effect would have been to deprive the substantial majority of the owners of their reimbursement.\" Given this lack of clarity, we construe Plaintiffs' argument as presenting both facial and as-applied takings challenges.</p>\n<p>[11]  We note that Plaintiffs' due process claim only goes to the lack of notice of the <i>transfer</i> of the duplicate premiums to the Secretary pursuant to Law 230. Plaintiffs do not challenge the sufficiency of the notice post-transfer but prior to escheat.\n</p>\n<p>We further note that Puerto Rico's insurance code requires \"[e]very insurer and every general agent, manager, or producer\" to produce a report of all unclaimed premiums, <i>see</i> P.R. Laws Ann. tit. 26, § 2604(1), and \"cause notices to be published based on the information contained in the reports.\" <i>Id.</i> § 2605(1). Moreover, \"[s]uch notice must be published once a week for two (2) consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in Puerto Rico.\" <i>Id.</i> Presumably, \"general agent, manager, or producer\" includes the Secretary, but we do not need to address the matter here. <i>See id.</i> § 2612 (\"The provisions of this chapter shall prevail over the provisions of any other chapter present or future which may be in conflict herewith.\").</p>\n<p>[12]  The district court dismissed Plaintiffs' due process claims for compensatory damages on qualified immunity grounds, and we address the dismissal of those claims separately below.</p>\n<p>[13]  We speculate that one reason why the district court did not address this particular due process claim may be because Plaintiffs did not adequately present the claim below. However, Defendants do not assert waiver as a defense, and as both parties briefed the issue, we address it.</p>\n\n</div>",
