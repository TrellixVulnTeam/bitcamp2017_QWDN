Keselica appeals the district\n\ncourt's sua sponte dismissal of his civil rights complaint pursuant\n\nto 28 U.S.C. ยง 1915(e)(2)(B)(ii).      Having carefully reviewed the\n\nrecord and appellant's submissions on appeal, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict   court   correctly   determined   that   Keselica's   claims\n\nchallenged the legality of his confinement and therefore were not\n\ncognizable under 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983.      See Wilkinson v. Dotson, 544\n\nU.S. 74, 81-82 (2005); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 489-90\n\n(1973) (challenge to fact or duration of confinement must be\n\nthrough habeas corpus).   Dismissal of the complaint was proper for\n\nthe reasons set forth in the magistrate judge's December 4, 2006,\n\nReport and Recommendation, subsequently adopted by the district\n\ncourt.\n\n           To the extent Keselica challenges the district court's\n\ndenial of leave to amend the complaint, no error is apparent\n\nbecause the proposed amendments, which would have added claims\n\nagainst Virginia officials and a demand for monetary damages, would\n\nnot have cured the deficiencies in the complaint.       See Universal\n\nComm. Sys., Inc. v. Lycos, Inc., 478 F.3d 413, 418 (1st Cir. 2007);\n\nAponte-Torres v. University of Puerto Rico, 445 F.3d 50, 58 (1st\n\nCir. 2006). Further, contrary to Keselica's contention, appellees'\n\nfailure to file a brief on appeal does not amount to a waiver of\n\nobjections to Keselica's arguments.     See Fed. R.
