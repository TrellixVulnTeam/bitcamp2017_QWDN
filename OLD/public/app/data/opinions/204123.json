Plaintiff-Appellant Greg Schubert\n\nbrought a civil rights claim pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983 against\n\nthe City of Springfield and police officer J.B. Stern.1           Schubert\n\nalleged that his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights were\n\nviolated when Officer Stern stopped him in front of the Springfield\n\ncourthouse to investigate Schubert's possession of a handgun.            The\n\ndistrict court granted summary judgment in favor of the officer as\n\nto all claims against him and dismissed sua sponte Schubert's\n\nclaims against Officer Stern's employer, the City of Springfield.\n\nHaving carefully reviewed the facts of the case and the applicable\n\ncase law, we affirm the district court's decision in full.\n\n                              I.   Background\n\nA. Relevant Facts\n\n              Because we are reviewing a summary judgment order granted\n\nin favor of the defendants, we evaluate the record \"in the light\n\nmost favorable to, and drawing all reasonable inferences in favor\n\nof, the nonmoving party,\" in this case Schubert.           Feliciano de la\n\nCruz v. El Conquistador Resort & Country Club, 218 F.3d 1, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).      We thus relate the facts with this standard in mind.\n\n              Schubert is a prominent criminal defense attorney who has\n\nworked   in    Springfield,   Massachusetts     for   approximately   thirty\n\nyears.   On July 21, 2006, Officer Stern, seated in his patrol car\n\n\n\n     1\n      He also brought various state civil rights claims and state\nlaw tort claims against the defendants.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fnear the Springfield courthouse, observed Schubert walking toward\n\nthe courthouse.       The location is considered a high-crime area.\n\nSchubert was dressed in a suit with an unbuttoned jacket and was\n\ncarrying a briefcase.      Stern noted that Schubert was also carrying\n\na handgun in a holster.        Despite the very hot weather that day,\n\nSchubert was wearing his suit jacket, apparently in order to\n\nconceal the handgun; however, he had the jacket unbuttoned, which\n\nallowed the officer to see the weapon. According to Stern, several\n\npassers-by also noticed Schubert's gun and alerted the officer to\n\nthe   firearm    by   waving   and   pointing.   However,   a   subsequent\n\ninvestigation of the incident by the police department produced no\n\nwitnesses or other proof of Stern's allegation regarding the\n\npassers-by.\n\n           On Schubert's account of the events, once Stern noticed\n\nSchubert's partially concealed weapon, the officer leaped from his\n\ncruiser in a \"dynamic and explosive\" manner, with his gun un-\n\nholstered.      Stern then pointed his weapon at Schubert's face.      The\n\nofficer ordered Schubert to stop and put his hands in the air.\n\nSchubert complied.        When asked if he had a weapon, Schubert\n\nresponded that he did and that he had a license to carry.            While\n\nstill pointing his gun at Schubert, Stern reached inside Schubert's\n\njacket and removed the weapon from its holster.        Stern then walked\n\nbackward toward his cruiser, set his gun down, and removed the clip\n\nand chambered round from Schubert's gun.         Schubert replied in the\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fnegative when Stern asked if he was carrying any other weapons.\n\nStern then frisked Schubert and asked him for his license to carry.\n\nSchubert produced his \"Class A\" gun license, which also indicated\n\nthat Schubert was an attorney.       He also handed over his driver's\n\nlicense.\n\n            Stern ordered Schubert to stay where he was, in the\n\nstreet in front of the police cruiser, and Stern took the gun,\n\nammunition and licenses and got into his cruiser.              The officer\n\nverified Schubert's driver's license and attempted to verify the\n\nvalidity of his gun license.      In Schubert's version of the facts,\n\nSchubert stayed in front of the cruiser for several minutes, then\n\nmoved to ask Stern if he could stand in the shade because it was a\n\nhot day.2    Stern denied the request.        Shortly thereafter Stern\n\nescorted Schubert into the back of the cruiser.                Inside the\n\nvehicle,    Stern   partially   Mirandized   Schubert,   see   Miranda   v.\n\nArizona, 384 U.S. 436, 478-79 (1966), mentioned the possibility of\n\na criminal charge, and told Schubert that he (Stern) was the only\n\nperson allowed to carry a weapon on his beat.\n\n            Stern continued to attempt to verify the validity of\n\nSchubert's weapons license, but because Massachusetts lacked a\n\ncentralized database containing such information, the officer soon\n\n\n\n     2\n      Stern alleges that Schubert moved repeatedly and a later\npolice department investigation uncovered one witness who\ncorroborated that account.   However, given the summary judgment\nstandard we do not consider this version of the facts.\n\n                                   -4-\n\frealized that the inquiry could take a significant amount of time.\n\nThus, about five minutes after moving Schubert into the cruiser,\n\nStern told Schubert that he was free to go, but that Schubert would\n\nhave to retrieve his gun and gun license from the Springfield\n\npolice department.          The entire stop took about ten minutes.\n\n            On July 26, 2006, Schubert filed a citizen's complaint\n\nagainst Stern for his conduct on July 21.                     As a result of the\n\nreport, the Springfield Police Commissioner recommended that Stern\n\nbe retrained on Massachusetts firearms law but found no specific\n\nwrongdoing       on    Officer     Stern's       part   and   did    not    recommend\n\ndisciplinary action.\n\nB. Proceedings Below\n\n            On    March      8,    2007,   Schubert       filed     an   eleven-count\n\ncomplaint    in       the   U.S.    District      Court    for    the    District   of\n\nMassachusetts against Stern and the City of Springfield.                     Schubert\n\nasserted federal civil rights claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\n\nunder the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, accompanied by state\n\ncivil rights and tort claims.              Stern moved for summary judgment,\n\nand after a motion hearing, the district court granted Stern's\n\nmotion as to all claims against him.                       The court sua sponte\n\ndismissed with prejudice the federal claims against the City of\n\nSpringfield and dismissed the state claims against the City without\n\nprejudice.    This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f                             II.   Discussion\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n            We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo.    We evaluate the record in the light most favorable to the\n\nnon-moving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of\n\nSchubert.    See Feliciano de la Cruz, 218 F.3d at 5.       We will uphold\n\na district court order granting summary judgment \"if the pleadings,\n\nthe discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits\n\nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\n\nthat the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"         Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(c)(2).\n\nB.   Fourth Amendment Claim\n\n            Schubert primarily contends that Stern lacked reasonable\n\nsuspicion to stop him and that the scope of the stop was not\n\nreasonably related to the officer's original purpose.            Schubert\n\nalso argues that there are unresolved material facts that preclude\n\nsummary judgment, that the district court failed to view the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to Schubert, and that the\n\nopinion below was \"unsupported by any evidence other than [the\n\ncourt's] philosophical views\" about gun control.\n\n            The   Fourth   Amendment   protects   against    unreasonable\n\nsearches and seizures.      See U.S. Const. Amend. IV.        When police\n\nconduct rises to the level of an arrest it is a seizure that\n\nrequires probable cause under the Warrant Clause of the Fourth\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fAmendment.      See Terry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 20 (1968).    There are,\n\nhowever, certain encounters between police and private citizens,\n\ncalled Terry stops, that fall short of the intrusiveness of a full\n\narrest.      These   encounters   require   \"necessarily   swift   action\n\npredicated upon the on-the-spot observations of the officer on the\n\nbeat.\"    Id.    When conducting a Terry stop, a police officer may\n\nbriefly detain an individual for questioning if the officer has\n\n\"reasonable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal\n\nactivity 'may be afoot.'\"     United States v. Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 7\n\n(1989) (quoting Terry, 392 U.S. at 30); see also United States v.\n\nWright, 582 F.3d 199, 205 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n           In determining whether a Terry stop is justified, our\n\ninquiry involves two steps, first, \"whether the officer's action\n\nwas justified at its inception,\" and second, \"whether it was\n\nreasonably related in scope to the circumstances which justified\n\nthe interference in the first place.\"       Terry, 392 U.S. at 20.    The\n\ninitial stop requires reasonable suspicion, which must be rooted in\n\n\"a particularized and objective basis\" for suspecting illegal\n\nconduct on the part of the person stopped.      Wright, 582 F.3d at 205\n\n(quoting Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690, 696 (1996)).         The\n\nparticularity requirement is satisfied by a finding \"grounded in\n\nspecific and articulable facts.\"         United States v. Espinoza, 490\n\nF.3d 41, 47 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v. Hensley, 469\n\nU.S. 221, 229 (1985)).     The objective component requires courts to\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f\"focus not on what the officer himself believed but, rather, on\n\nwhat a reasonable officer in his position would have thought.\" Id.\n\n1. The Initial Stop\n\n             Schubert argues that Stern was unjustified in stopping\n\nhim initially because Stern did not have an articulable suspicion,\n\nbased on the totality of the circumstances, to detain Schubert. We\n\ndisagree.      Stern had an articulable, objective basis for his\n\nreasonable     suspicion   that   Schubert   may    have   been   engaged   in\n\ncriminal activity: the officer observed Schubert walking toward the\n\nSpringfield courthouse carrying a gun.             This simple, undisputed\n\nfact provided a sufficient basis for Stern's concern that Schubert\n\nmay have been about to commit a serious criminal act, or, at the\n\nvery least, was openly carrying a firearm without a license to do\n\nso.    Schubert maintains that his suit jacket was meant to conceal\n\nthe weapon and that Stern was unable to produce any of the passers-\n\nby that he claimed had alerted him to the existence of Schubert's\n\ngun.       The fact remains, however, that the officer saw a man\n\ncarrying a gun in a high-crime area, walking toward an important\n\npublic building.3\n\n             Schubert contends that his clothing, his age, and the\n\nfact that he was carrying a briefcase are factors that should\n\nundercut the reasonableness of Stern's suspicion.                 We are not\n\n\n\n       3\n      In addition, Stern noted that in his experience, most people\nwho carry firearms in Springfield are not licensed to do so.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fpersuaded.     A Terry stop is intended for just such a situation,\n\nwhere the officer has a reasonable concern about potential criminal\n\nactivity    based   on    his    \"on-the-spot     observations,\"     and   where\n\nimmediate action is required to ensure that any criminal activity\n\nis stopped or prevented.           Terry, 392 U.S. at 20.          We need not\n\noutline in detail the obvious and potentially horrific events that\n\ncould have transpired had an officer noted a man walking toward the\n\ncourthouse with a gun and chosen not to intervene.              In addition,\n\n\"[u]nder Terry, the test is whether the circumstances give rise to\n\na reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, not whether the\n\ndefendant's     actions    are     subject   to    no   reasonable    innocent\n\nexplanation.\"    United States v. Stanley, 915 F.2d 54, 57 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).     It is clear in this case that, in hindsight, Schubert in\n\nfact posed no threat to public safety.             However, on these facts,\n\nOfficer Stern certainly had reasonable suspicion to stop the\n\nunknown armed man in order to ascertain his identity, his authority\n\nto possess the gun, and his intentions.\n\n            Schubert also contends that there are material facts in\n\ndispute which should bar resolution of this case at the summary\n\njudgment stage. He points to the following: (1) Stern claimed that\n\nthe gun was tucked into Schubert's pants or held in a pants holster\n\nwhile Schubert asserts that the gun was in fact holstered on his\n\nhip; and (2) Stern claimed that passers-by noticed Schubert's gun,\n\nwhile Schubert asserts that the gun was not \"visible to the average\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fperson   walking   toward   or   past   the   Plaintiff   on   the   street.\"\n\nHowever, these are not material factual differences that would sway\n\nthe outcome of the litigation.      The precise location of the gun is\n\ninconsequential; what matters is that Stern observed the weapon on\n\nSchubert's person.    Further, whether or not passers-by saw the gun\n\nis immaterial to the question of whether an objective officer who\n\nobserved Schubert walking in such a manner would possess reasonable\n\nsuspicion of criminal activity.4\n\n            Finally, we briefly note that Schubert's contention that\n\nthe district court's opinion was \"unsupported by any evidence other\n\nthan [the court's] philosophical views\" about gun control is far\n\noff base.     The opinion below rested on sound, undisputed facts\n\nregarding an officer's observation of an armed man approaching a\n\ncourthouse.    The appellant makes no colorable showing that the\n\nlower court's conclusion was based on something other than the\n\nfacts.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      In addition, Schubert's reliance upon Flowers v. Fiore, 359\nF.3d 24 (1st Cir. 2004), is misplaced.      In Flowers, this court\nupheld the Terry stop of a motorist who fit the description of a\npossible armed suspect.     Id. at 34 (stressing substantial and\nserious nature of government interest in stopping potential armed\nattack). Here, unlike in Flowers, a police officer stopped a man\nthat he definitively knew was armed and approaching a courthouse in\na high-crime area. The officer's ground for suspicion in this case\nwas greater than that in Flowers as the officer here could confirm\nwith his own eyes that Schubert indeed possessed a weapon.\n\n                                   -10-\n\f           We thus conclude that the district court had ample reason\n\nto conclude that Officer Stern's investigatory stop was justified\n\nat its inception.\n\n2. The Scope of the Search\n\n           Schubert also contends that the manner and length of the\n\nstop exceeded the circumstances which justified the stop in the\n\nfirst place. Schubert reasons that once he produced his license to\n\ncarry,   the   officer   should   have    released   him   and    ended   the\n\nencounter.     Schubert also takes issue with the manner in which\n\nStern suddenly emerged from the police cruiser with his weapon\n\ndrawn.   Further, Schubert questions Stern's subsequent five-minute\n\ndetention of Schubert in the rear of the cruiser, during which time\n\nhe partially Mirandized Schubert and mentioned the possibility of\n\ncharging him with a crime.        Finally, Schubert argues that Stern\n\nunreasonably confiscated his weapon, requiring Schubert to retrieve\n\nit from the police department.\n\n           However, as the district court correctly concluded, once\n\nStern had reasonable suspicion justifying a stop, he was permitted\n\nto take actions to ensure his own safety.       See Schubert v. City of\n\nSpringfield, 602 F.Supp.2d 254, 257 (D. Mass. 2009).             The officer\n\ntook several reasonable steps given that Schubert was an unknown\n\narmed man walking in that particular location: he emerged quickly\n\nfrom his vehicle, drew his gun, executed a pat-frisk, requested\n\nidentification and a gun license, attempted to confirm the validity\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fof the licenses, and escorted Schubert into the cruiser after\n\nSchubert   moved    from   the    position   in   which   the   officer   had\n\ninstructed him to remain.        All these actions were related in scope\n\nto the circumstances that justified the initial stop, namely,\n\nSchubert's open possession of a weapon in front of a courthouse.\n\nStern's concern for his own safety and for the safety of others was\n\nthe context for this stop. It is \"clearly unreasonable to deny the\n\nofficer the power to take necessary measures to determine whether\n\nthe person is in fact carrying a weapon and to neutralize the\n\nthreat of physical harm.\"        Stanley, 915 F.2d at 57 (quoting Terry,\n\n392 U.S. at 24).5\n\n           Further, we do not agree with Schubert's contention that\n\nthe gun license was valid on its face and therefore the several\n\nminute delay during which Stern attempted to confirm the validity\n\n\n     5\n      Schubert cites Nelson v. City of Cambridge, 101 F.Supp.2d 44,\n47-48 (D. Mass. 2000), in support of his claim that the means\nexceeded the scope of the stop.      The case is inapposite.     In\nNelson, the district court denied summary judgment and held that a\nreasonable jury could find that the means used to accomplish a stop\nwere excessive where officers stopped a suspect at gunpoint,\nfrisked him, and then continued to restrain him for an additional\nfifteen to thirty minutes after ascertaining that he was not armed,\ndid not match a robbery suspect's height or age, was identified by\nanother person as being rightfully in the location, and had\nprovided a plausible explanation for his meandering down the\nstreet.    Id. at 47.      Schubert argues that Stern was not\ninvestigating a crime like the one in Nelson. We agree, though not\nto the benefit of Schubert's position.          Here, the officer\nascertained visually that Schubert possessed a gun in a high-crime\narea near a courthouse. This scenario is distinct from Nelson,\nwhere the suspect was held for a significant length of time after\nit was determined that he was not armed or involved in the\nsuspected crime.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fof the license was unreasonable.      Just as an officer is justified\n\nin attempting to confirm the validity of a driver's license, such\n\na routine check is also valid and prudent regarding a gun license.\n\nAs it happens, Massachusetts did not have a simple way for police\n\nofficers to conduct such a check, so Stern's effort to do so took\n\nseveral minutes.     But the entire stop took only ten minutes and\n\nwhen Stern realized that he would not be able to confirm the gun\n\nlicense within a reasonable time, he sensibly opted to terminate\n\nthe stop and release Schubert, but retain the weapon.\n\n          We thus conclude that the district court correctly held\n\nthat Stern acted within the permissible scope of his initial Terry\n\nstop of Schubert.    Therefore, having already determined that the\n\ninitial stop complied with Terry, we affirm the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment on Schubert's Fourth Amendment claim.\n\nC. Second Amendment Claim\n\n          Schubert also argues that the officer's stop violated\n\nSchubert's Second Amendment right to bear arms.            He cites to the\n\nSupreme Court's recent decision in District of Columbia v. Heller,\n\n128 S.Ct. 2783 (2008), to support his assertion that because the\n\nright to bear arms is a \"fundamental individual right,\" Officer\n\nStern had \"absolutely no reason to interfere with the lawful\n\nexercise of this right.\"\n\n          Schubert    did   not   assert   a   violation   of   his   Second\n\nAmendment right in his original complaint.           Nor did he file an\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\famended complaint to alert the court and the other parties to such\n\na claim.     He also did not raise the claim in his written opposition\n\nto summary judgment.       The issue was first raised by Schubert at\n\noral argument on the motion for summary judgment.              Having reviewed\n\nthe transcript, we conclude that his counsel's references to a\n\nSecond Amendment issue were extremely brief and were unsupported by\n\ncitations to specific case law. In addition, counsel did not frame\n\nhis comments on the issue as providing an additional, specific\n\nground for liability against Stern and the City.\n\n              We thus conclude that Schubert failed properly to raise\n\na Second Amendment claim in the court below, and we therefore\n\ndecline to entertain his appellate argument on this issue.                  See,\n\ne.g., In re Ruah, 119 F.3d 46, 51 (1st Cir. 1997); McCoy v. Mass.\n\nInst. of Tech., 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 1991) (\"Overburdened\n\ntrial judges cannot be expected to be mind readers.              If claims are\n\nmerely insinuated rather than actually articulated in the trial\n\ncourt,   we    will   ordinarily   refuse   to   deem   them    preserved    for\n\nappellate review.\").       Our conclusion is not altered by the fact\n\nthat   the    district   court   chose   briefly   to   address    Schubert's\n\nassertions regarding the Second Amendment in a short footnote to\n\nits summary judgment memorandum.\n\n4. Other Claims\n\n              Because we affirm the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment as to the federal claims against Stern, we also affirm the\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\flower court's sua sponte dismissal with prejudice of Schubert's\n\nfederal claims against the City.

Feliciano de la\n\nCruz v. El Conquistador Resort & Country Club, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199020\"><a href=\"/opinion/199020/feliciano-v-el-conquistador/\"><span class=\"volume\">218</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 5 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).      We thus relate the facts with this standard in mind.\n\n              Schubert is a prominent criminal defense attorney who has\n\nworked   in    Springfield,   Massachusetts     for   approximately   thirty\n\nyears.   On July 21, 2006, Officer Stern, seated in his patrol car\n\n\n\n     1\n      He also brought various state civil rights claims and state\nlaw tort claims against the defendants.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fnear the Springfield courthouse, observed Schubert walking toward\n\nthe courthouse.       The location is considered a high-crime area.\n\nSchubert was dressed in a suit with an unbuttoned jacket and was\n\ncarrying a briefcase.      Stern noted that Schubert was also carrying\n\na handgun in a holster.        Despite the very hot weather that day,\n\nSchubert was wearing his suit jacket, apparently in order to\n\nconceal the handgun; however, he had the jacket unbuttoned, which\n\nallowed the officer to see the weapon. According to Stern, several\n\npassers-by also noticed Schubert's gun and alerted the officer to\n\nthe   firearm    by   waving   and   pointing.   However,   a   subsequent\n\ninvestigation of the incident by the police department produced no\n\nwitnesses or other proof of Stern's allegation regarding the\n\npassers-by.\n\n           On Schubert's account of the events, once Stern noticed\n\nSchubert's partially concealed weapon, the officer leaped from his\n\ncruiser in a \"dynamic and explosive\" manner, with his gun un-\n\nholstered.      Stern then pointed his weapon at Schubert's face.      The\n\nofficer ordered Schubert to stop and put his hands in the air.\n\nSchubert complied.        When asked if he had a weapon, Schubert\n\nresponded that he did and that he had a license to carry.            While\n\nstill pointing his gun at Schubert, Stern reached inside Schubert's\n\njacket and removed the weapon from its holster.        Stern then walked\n\nbackward toward his cruiser, set his gun down, and removed the clip\n\nand chambered round from Schubert's gun.         Schubert replied in the\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fnegative when Stern asked if he was carrying any other weapons.\n\nStern then frisked Schubert and asked him for his license to carry.\n\nSchubert produced his \"Class A\" gun license, which also indicated\n\nthat Schubert was an attorney.       He also handed over his driver's\n\nlicense.\n\n            Stern ordered Schubert to stay where he was, in the\n\nstreet in front of the police cruiser, and Stern took the gun,\n\nammunition and licenses and got into his cruiser.              The officer\n\nverified Schubert's driver's license and attempted to verify the\n\nvalidity of his gun license.      In Schubert's version of the facts,\n\nSchubert stayed in front of the cruiser for several minutes, then\n\nmoved to ask Stern if he could stand in the shade because it was a\n\nhot day.2    Stern denied the request.        Shortly thereafter Stern\n\nescorted Schubert into the back of the cruiser.                Inside the\n\nvehicle,    Stern   partially   Mirandized   Schubert,   see   Miranda   v.\n\nArizona, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"107252\"><a href=\"/opinion/107252/miranda-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">384</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 478-79 (1966), mentioned the possibility of\n\na criminal charge, and told Schubert that he (Stern) was the only\n\nperson allowed to carry a weapon on his beat.\n\n            Stern continued to attempt to verify the validity of\n\nSchubert's weapons license, but because Massachusetts lacked a\n\ncentralized database containing such information, the officer soon\n\n\n\n     2\n      Stern alleges that Schubert moved repeatedly and a later\npolice department investigation uncovered one witness who\ncorroborated that account.   However, given the summary judgment\nstandard we do not consider this version of the facts.\n\n                                   -4-\n\frealized that the inquiry could take a significant amount of time.\n\nThus, about five minutes after moving Schubert into the cruiser,\n\nStern told Schubert that he was free to go, but that Schubert would\n\nhave to retrieve his gun and gun license from the Springfield\n\npolice department.          The entire stop took about ten minutes.\n\n            On July 26, 2006, Schubert filed a citizen's complaint\n\nagainst Stern for his conduct on July 21.                     As a result of the\n\nreport, the Springfield Police Commissioner recommended that Stern\n\nbe retrained on Massachusetts firearms law but found no specific\n\nwrongdoing       on    Officer     Stern's       part   and   did    not    recommend\n\ndisciplinary action.\n\nB. Proceedings Below\n\n            On    March      8,    2007,   Schubert       filed     an   eleven-count\n\ncomplaint    in       the   U.S.    District      Court    for    the    District   of\n\nMassachusetts against Stern and the City of Springfield.                     Schubert\n\nasserted federal civil rights claims pursuant to 42 U.S.C. ยง 1983\n\nunder the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments, accompanied by state\n\ncivil rights and tort claims.              Stern moved for summary judgment,\n\nand after a motion hearing, the district court granted Stern's\n\nmotion as to all claims against him.                       The court sua sponte\n\ndismissed with prejudice the federal claims against the City of\n\nSpringfield and dismissed the state claims against the City without\n\nprejudice.    This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\f                             II.   Discussion\n\nA.   Standard of Review\n\n            We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo.    We evaluate the record in the light most favorable to the\n\nnon-moving party, drawing all reasonable inferences in favor of\n\nSchubert.    See Feliciano de la Cruz, 218 F.3d at 5.       We will uphold\n\na district court order granting summary judgment \"if the pleadings,\n\nthe discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits\n\nshow that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and\n\nthat the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\"         Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(c)(2).\n\nB.   Fourth Amendment Claim\n\n            Schubert primarily contends that Stern lacked reasonable\n\nsuspicion to stop him and that the scope of the stop was not\n\nreasonably related to the officer's original purpose.            Schubert\n\nalso argues that there are unresolved material facts that preclude\n\nsummary judgment, that the district court failed to view the\n\nevidence in the light most favorable to Schubert, and that the\n\nopinion below was \"unsupported by any evidence other than [the\n\ncourt's] philosophical views\" about gun control.\n\n            The   Fourth   Amendment   protects   against    unreasonable\n\nsearches and seizures.      See U.S. Const. Amend. IV.        When police\n\nconduct rises to the level of an arrest it is a seizure that\n\nrequires probable cause under the Warrant Clause of the Fourth\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fAmendment.

There are,\n\nhowever, certain encounters between police and private citizens,\n\ncalled Terry stops, that fall short of the intrusiveness of a full\n\narrest.      These   encounters   require   \"necessarily   swift   action\n\npredicated upon the on-the-spot observations of the officer on the\n\nbeat.\"    Id.

The\n\ninitial stop requires reasonable suspicion, which must be rooted in\n\n\"a particularized and objective basis\" for suspecting illegal\n\nconduct on the part of the person stopped.      Wright, 582 F.3d at 205\n\n(quoting Ornelas v. United States, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118030\"><a href=\"/opinion/118030/ornelas-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">517</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">690</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 696 (1996)).         The\n\nparticularity requirement is satisfied by a finding \"grounded in\n\nspecific and articulable facts.\"         United States v. Espinoza, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202794\"><a href=\"/opinion/202794/united-states-v-espinoza/\"><span class=\"volume\">490</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 47 (1st Cir. 2007) (quoting United States v.

The objective component requires courts to\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f\"focus not on what the officer himself believed but, rather, on\n\nwhat a reasonable officer in his position would have thought.\" Id.\n\n1. The Initial Stop\n\n             Schubert argues that Stern was unjustified in stopping\n\nhim initially because Stern did not have an articulable suspicion,\n\nbased on the totality of the circumstances, to detain Schubert. We\n\ndisagree.      Stern had an articulable, objective basis for his\n\nreasonable     suspicion   that   Schubert   may    have   been   engaged   in\n\ncriminal activity: the officer observed Schubert walking toward the\n\nSpringfield courthouse carrying a gun.             This simple, undisputed\n\nfact provided a sufficient basis for Stern's concern that Schubert\n\nmay have been about to commit a serious criminal act, or, at the\n\nvery least, was openly carrying a firearm without a license to do\n\nso.    Schubert maintains that his suit jacket was meant to conceal\n\nthe weapon and that Stern was unable to produce any of the passers-\n\nby that he claimed had alerted him to the existence of Schubert's\n\ngun.       The fact remains, however, that the officer saw a man\n\ncarrying a gun in a high-crime area, walking toward an important\n\npublic building.3\n\n             Schubert contends that his clothing, his age, and the\n\nfact that he was carrying a briefcase are factors that should\n\nundercut the reasonableness of Stern's suspicion.                 We are not\n\n\n\n       3\n      In addition, Stern noted that in his experience, most people\nwho carry firearms in Springfield are not licensed to do so.\n\n                                    -8-\n\fpersuaded.     A Terry stop is intended for just such a situation,\n\nwhere the officer has a reasonable concern about potential criminal\n\nactivity    based   on    his    \"on-the-spot     observations,\"     and   where\n\nimmediate action is required to ensure that any criminal activity\n\nis stopped or prevented.           Terry, 392 U.S. at 20.          We need not\n\noutline in detail the obvious and potentially horrific events that\n\ncould have transpired had an officer noted a man walking toward the\n\ncourthouse with a gun and chosen not to intervene.              In addition,\n\n\"[u]nder Terry, the test is whether the circumstances give rise to\n\na reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, not whether the\n\ndefendant's     actions    are     subject   to    no   reasonable    innocent\n\nexplanation.\"    United States v. Stanley, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"548685\"><a href=\"/opinion/548685/united-states-v-dennis-g-stanley/\"><span class=\"volume\">915</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">54</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 57 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).     It is clear in this case that, in hindsight, Schubert in\n\nfact posed no threat to public safety.             However, on these facts,\n\nOfficer Stern certainly had reasonable suspicion to stop the\n\nunknown armed man in order to ascertain his identity, his authority\n\nto possess the gun, and his intentions.\n\n            Schubert also contends that there are material facts in\n\ndispute which should bar resolution of this case at the summary\n\njudgment stage. He points to the following: (1) Stern claimed that\n\nthe gun was tucked into Schubert's pants or held in a pants holster\n\nwhile Schubert asserts that the gun was in fact holstered on his\n\nhip; and (2) Stern claimed that passers-by noticed Schubert's gun,\n\nwhile Schubert asserts that the gun was not \"visible to the average\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fperson   walking   toward   or   past   the   Plaintiff   on   the   street.\"\n\nHowever, these are not material factual differences that would sway\n\nthe outcome of the litigation.      The precise location of the gun is\n\ninconsequential; what matters is that Stern observed the weapon on\n\nSchubert's person.    Further, whether or not passers-by saw the gun\n\nis immaterial to the question of whether an objective officer who\n\nobserved Schubert walking in such a manner would possess reasonable\n\nsuspicion of criminal activity.4\n\n            Finally, we briefly note that Schubert's contention that\n\nthe district court's opinion was \"unsupported by any evidence other\n\nthan [the court's] philosophical views\" about gun control is far\n\noff base.     The opinion below rested on sound, undisputed facts\n\nregarding an officer's observation of an armed man approaching a\n\ncourthouse.    The appellant makes no colorable showing that the\n\nlower court's conclusion was based on something other than the\n\nfacts.\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      In addition, Schubert's reliance upon Flowers v. Fiore, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200909\"><a href=\"/opinion/200909/flowers-v-fiore/\"><span class=\"volume\">359</span>\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">24</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1st Cir. 2004), is misplaced.      In Flowers, this court\nupheld the Terry stop of a motorist who fit the description of a\npossible armed suspect.     Id. at 34 (stressing substantial and\nserious nature of government interest in stopping potential armed\nattack). Here, unlike in Flowers, a police officer stopped a man\nthat he definitively knew was armed and approaching a courthouse in\na high-crime area. The officer's ground for suspicion in this case\nwas greater than that in Flowers as the officer here could confirm\nwith his own eyes that Schubert indeed possessed a weapon.\n\n                                   -10-\n\f           We thus conclude that the district court had ample reason\n\nto conclude that Officer Stern's investigatory stop was justified\n\nat its inception.\n\n2. The Scope of the Search\n\n           Schubert also contends that the manner and length of the\n\nstop exceeded the circumstances which justified the stop in the\n\nfirst place. Schubert reasons that once he produced his license to\n\ncarry,   the   officer   should   have    released   him   and    ended   the\n\nencounter.     Schubert also takes issue with the manner in which\n\nStern suddenly emerged from the police cruiser with his weapon\n\ndrawn.   Further, Schubert questions Stern's subsequent five-minute\n\ndetention of Schubert in the rear of the cruiser, during which time\n\nhe partially Mirandized Schubert and mentioned the possibility of\n\ncharging him with a crime.        Finally, Schubert argues that Stern\n\nunreasonably confiscated his weapon, requiring Schubert to retrieve\n\nit from the police department.\n\n           However, as the district court correctly concluded, once\n\nStern had reasonable suspicion justifying a stop, he was permitted\n\nto take actions to ensure his own safety.       See Schubert v. City of\n\nSpringfield, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2506900\"><a href=\"/opinion/2506900/schubert-v-city-of-springfield/\"><span class=\"volume\">602</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">254</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 257 (D. Mass. 2009).             The officer\n\ntook several reasonable steps given that Schubert was an unknown\n\narmed man walking in that particular location: he emerged quickly\n\nfrom his vehicle, drew his gun, executed a pat-frisk, requested\n\nidentification and a gun license, attempted to confirm the validity\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fof the licenses, and escorted Schubert into the cruiser after\n\nSchubert   moved    from   the    position   in   which   the   officer   had\n\ninstructed him to remain.        All these actions were related in scope\n\nto the circumstances that justified the initial stop, namely,\n\nSchubert's open possession of a weapon in front of a courthouse.\n\nStern's concern for his own safety and for the safety of others was\n\nthe context for this stop. It is \"clearly unreasonable to deny the\n\nofficer the power to take necessary measures to determine whether\n\nthe person is in fact carrying a weapon and to neutralize the\n\nthreat of physical harm.\"        Stanley, 915 F.2d at 57 (quoting Terry,\n\n392 U.S. at 24).5\n\n           Further, we do not agree with Schubert's contention that\n\nthe gun license was valid on its face and therefore the several\n\nminute delay during which Stern attempted to confirm the validity\n\n\n     5\n      Schubert cites Nelson v. City of Cambridge, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2510265\"><a href=\"/opinion/2510265/nelson-v-city-of-cambridge/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n47-48 (D. Mass. 2000), in support of his claim that the means\nexceeded the scope of the stop.      The case is inapposite.     In\nNelson, the district court denied summary judgment and held that a\nreasonable jury could find that the means used to accomplish a stop\nwere excessive where officers stopped a suspect at gunpoint,\nfrisked him, and then continued to restrain him for an additional\nfifteen to thirty minutes after ascertaining that he was not armed,\ndid not match a robbery suspect's height or age, was identified by\nanother person as being rightfully in the location, and had\nprovided a plausible explanation for his meandering down the\nstreet.    Id. at 47.      Schubert argues that Stern was not\ninvestigating a crime like the one in Nelson. We agree, though not\nto the benefit of Schubert's position.          Here, the officer\nascertained visually that Schubert possessed a gun in a high-crime\narea near a courthouse. This scenario is distinct from Nelson,\nwhere the suspect was held for a significant length of time after\nit was determined that he was not armed or involved in the\nsuspected crime.\n\n                                     -12-\n\fof the license was unreasonable.      Just as an officer is justified\n\nin attempting to confirm the validity of a driver's license, such\n\na routine check is also valid and prudent regarding a gun license.\n\nAs it happens, Massachusetts did not have a simple way for police\n\nofficers to conduct such a check, so Stern's effort to do so took\n\nseveral minutes.     But the entire stop took only ten minutes and\n\nwhen Stern realized that he would not be able to confirm the gun\n\nlicense within a reasonable time, he sensibly opted to terminate\n\nthe stop and release Schubert, but retain the weapon.\n\n          We thus conclude that the district court correctly held\n\nthat Stern acted within the permissible scope of his initial Terry\n\nstop of Schubert.    Therefore, having already determined that the\n\ninitial stop complied with Terry, we affirm the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment on Schubert's Fourth Amendment claim.\n\nC. Second Amendment Claim\n\n          Schubert also argues that the officer's stop violated\n\nSchubert's Second Amendment right to bear arms.            He cites to the\n\nSupreme Court's recent decision in District of Columbia v. Heller,\n\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145777\"><a href=\"/opinion/145777/district-of-columbia-v-heller/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2783</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (2008), to support his assertion that because the\n\nright to bear arms is a \"fundamental individual right,\" Officer\n\nStern had \"absolutely no reason to interfere with the lawful\n\nexercise of this right.\"\n\n          Schubert    did   not   assert   a   violation   of   his   Second\n\nAmendment right in his original complaint.           Nor did he file an\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\famended complaint to alert the court and the other parties to such\n\na claim.     He also did not raise the claim in his written opposition\n\nto summary judgment.       The issue was first raised by Schubert at\n\noral argument on the motion for summary judgment.              Having reviewed\n\nthe transcript, we conclude that his counsel's references to a\n\nSecond Amendment issue were extremely brief and were unsupported by\n\ncitations to specific case law. In addition, counsel did not frame\n\nhis comments on the issue as providing an additional, specific\n\nground for liability against Stern and the City.\n\n              We thus conclude that Schubert failed properly to raise\n\na Second Amendment claim in the court below, and we therefore\n\ndecline to entertain his appellate argument on this issue.                  See,\n\ne.g., In re Ruah, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197463\"><a href=\"/opinion/197463/noonan-v-rauh/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">46</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 51 (1st Cir. 1997); McCoy v.

If claims are\n\nmerely insinuated rather than actually articulated in the trial\n\ncourt,   we    will   ordinarily   refuse   to   deem   them    preserved    for\n\nappellate review.\").       Our conclusion is not altered by the fact\n\nthat   the    district   court   chose   briefly   to   address    Schubert's\n\nassertions regarding the Second Amendment in a short footnote to\n\nits summary judgment memorandum.\n\n4. Other Claims\n\n              Because we affirm the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment as to the federal claims against Stern, we also affirm the\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\flower court's sua sponte dismissal with prejudice of Schubert's\n\nfederal claims against the City.

In addition, we affirm the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment in favor of Stern as to all other claims against\n\nhim, and the court's sua sponte dismissal, without prejudice, of\n\nthe remaining state law claims against the City, for the reasons\n\ngiven by the district court.6\n\n                           III.   Conclusion\n\n           For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of Stern, the dismissal with\n\nprejudice of the federal claims against the City of Springfield,\n\nand the dismissal without prejudice of the remaining state law\n\nclaims against the City.\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      Schubert only raises the issue of whether his detention\namounted to a de facto arrest during his discussion of the state\ntort law claims of false arrest and false imprisonment.
