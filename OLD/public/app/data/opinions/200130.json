This matter comes on before\n\nthis court on defendant-appellant L.L. Bean's appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's order entered November 8, 2001, denying its motion\n\nfor judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new\n\ntrial.   For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the order of the\n\ndistrict court and uphold the jury verdict in favor of plaintiff-\n\nappellee Eileen Crowley.\n\n                           I.   BACKGROUND\n\n           We briefly describe the facts at the outset, but discuss\n\nthem in greater detail where applicable and essential to explain\nour determinations.   Since 1992, Crowley has worked for L.L. Bean,\n\na major catalog retailer based in Freeport, Maine, specializing in\noutdoor apparel and merchandise.    In 1996, she began working as an\n\"order picker operator\" in L.L. Bean's warehouses and in this\n\ncapacity   drove   22,000-pound    forklift-like   machines   called\ntranstackers that collect merchandise for packing and shifting.\nCrowley claims that from 1996 until July 1998, her co-worker, Paul\n\nJuhl, stalked and harassed her.\n           Evidence at trial supported a conclusion that during the\nperiod involved, Juhl engaged in disturbing and sometimes peculiar\n\nbehavior around Crowley, including grabbing her foot and massaging\nit against her will at an L.L. Bean pool party, continually\nfollowing her at work even when they were not scheduled to work in\n\nthe same warehouse, physically blocking her path and thereby\nforcing her to squeeze by him, giving her gifts designed to let her\n\nknow that he was watching her, dancing in the aisles near her,\n\n                                  -2-\n\fwaiting in the dark for her to come upon him, following her home,\n\nand even breaking into her house.             Crowley reported most of these\n\nincidents to her team leaders or supervisors, but she claims that\nL.L. Bean did not take timely effective action to protect her from\n\nJuhl and therefore maintained a hostile work environment.                      L.L.\n\nBean finally terminated Juhl's employment, but did so only after\nCrowley obtained a permanent court protection order against Juhl in\n\nJuly 1998.\n\n              On December 21, 1998, Crowley filed a complaint with the\n\nEqual Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") and the Maine\n\nHuman Rights Commission, claiming that L.L. Bean had engaged in sex\n\ndiscrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the\n\nCivil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq.,\n\nand the Maine Human Rights Act, Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 5, § 4572\n\n(West 2002).      After the EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter and the\n\nMaine Human Rights Commission determined that L.L. Bean had not\nengaged in either sex discrimination or retaliation, Crowley filed\n\nher complaint in the district court on June 22, 2000, asserting\n\nthat L.L. Bean had engaged in sex discrimination in violation of\n\nTitle   VII    and    the    Maine   Human    Rights   Act   predicated   on    her\n\nassertion      that    she    had    been    subjected   to    a   hostile     work\n\nenvironment.\n\n              The jury trial began on June 5, 2001, and concluded on\n\nJune 11, 2001.1       L.L. Bean moved for judgment as a matter of law\n\n\n  1\n   L.L. Bean unsuccessfully moved for summary judgment before the\ntrial. See Crowley v. L.L. Bean, Inc., 143 F. Supp. 2d 38 (D.\n\n                                        -3-\n\fpursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50 at the conclusion of Crowley's case-\n\nin-chief and renewed the motion after both parties rested.             Before\n\nsubmitting the case to the jury, the court partially granted the\nmotion but only as to Crowley's claim for punitive damages under\n\nthe Maine Human Rights Act.\n\n             After one day of deliberations, the jury returned its\nverdict on June 13, 2001, finding that L.L. Bean had violated Title\n\nVII   by    sexually    discriminating       against   Crowley   through   acts\n\noccurring on or after February 24, 1998.               The February 24, 1998\n\ndate was critical because Crowley filed her EEOC claim 300 days\n\nafter that date and she was required to file the charge within the\n\n300-day period for it to be timely.2           The jury also found that the\n\nunlawful discrimination was the result of a systemic violation, but\nnot of a serial violation.      The jury found, however, that L.L. Bean\n\nhad   not    violated    the   Maine     Human    Rights   Act   by   sexually\n\ndiscriminating against Crowley through acts occurring on or after\nJune 22, 1998.     The June 22, 1998 date was applicable because the\n\nMaine Human Rights Act has a two-year statute of limitations, and\n\nCrowley initiated this action on June 22, 2000.            See Me. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn. tit. 5, § 4613(2)(C) (West 2002).            Finally, the jury awarded\n\n\n\n\nMe. 2001).\n  2\n   The 300-day period was applicable because Maine has an entity\nwith the authority to grant or seek relief with respect to an\nalleged unlawful employment practice. See National R.R.\nPassenger Corp. v. Morgan, --- U.S. ---, 122 S. Ct. 2061, 2070\n(2002).\n\n                                       -4-\n\fCrowley $215,000 in compensatory damages, but denied her any\n\npunitive damages.\n\n           On June 26, 2001, L.L. Bean filed a renewed motion for\njudgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial\n\npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 50 and 59.      On November 8, 2001, the\n\ndistrict court denied the motion and entered an amended final\njudgment. On December 3, 2001, L.L. Bean filed a notice of appeal.\n\n\n\n              II.   JURISDICTION AND STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\nA. Jurisdiction\n\n           The district court had jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.\n\n§§ 1331, 1343, and 1367, and we have jurisdiction over this appeal\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1291.\nB. Standard of Review\n\n           To the extent that L.L. Bean appeals from the district\n\ncourt's denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law, our\nreview of the district court's ruling is plenary, and we must apply\n\nthe same standard that the district court applied in considering\nthe motion.   See Mangla v. Brown Univ., 135 F.3d 80, 82 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).    Accordingly, we must \"view the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to [Crowley], drawing all reasonable inferences in [her]\n\nfavor.\"   McMillan v. Mass. Soc'y for the Prevention of Cruelty to\n\nAnimals, 140 F.3d 288, 299 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).     Moreover, we must \"resolve all credibility issues\n\nin favor of the verdict.\"     United States v. Scharon, 187 F.3d 17,\n\n21 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                  -5-\n\f           Our review, however, \"is weighted toward preservation of\n\nthe jury verdict,\" for \"we must affirm unless the evidence was so\n\nstrongly and overwhelmingly inconsistent with the verdicts that no\nreasonable jury could have returned them.\"    Rodowicz v. Mass. Mut.\n\nLife Ins. Co., 279 F.3d 36, 41-42 (1st Cir. 2002) (internal\n\nquotation marks and brackets omitted); see also White v. N.H. Dep't\n\nof Corr., 221 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"Once a jury returns\n\na verdict, a 'heavy burden' is placed on one who challenges it.\").\n\nIndeed, we should \"not set aside a jury verdict as a matter of law\n\nunless there was only one conclusion the jury could have reached,\"\n\nMcMillan, 140 F.3d at 299, and that result was contrary to the\n\nverdict, see White, 221 F.3d at 259 (\"We may reverse only if a\n\nreasonable person could not have reached the conclusion of the\njury.\").\n\n           L.L. Bean argues that in the event that we do not grant\n\nit judgment as a matter of law, we should grant it a new trial\nbased on juror bias, erroneous evidentiary rulings, and improper\n\njury instructions.    L.L. Bean's motion for a new trial in the\n\ndistrict court predicated on juror bias was \"committed to the\n\ndiscretion of [the] district court.\"    McDonough Power Equip., Inc.\n\nv. Greenwood, 464 U.S. 548, 556, 104 S. Ct. 845, 850 (1984).\n\nTherefore,   \"[i]n   reviewing   the   district   court's   denial   of\n\nappellant['s] request for a new trial, we . . . consider only\n\nwhether the district court abused its discretion.\" Dall v. Coffin,\n\n970 F.2d 964, 969 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f             We review L.L. Bean's challenge of the district court's\n\nrulings to exclude or admit testimony primarily on an abuse-of-\n\ndiscretion basis.      See Cummings v. Standard Register Co., 265 F.3d\n56, 62 (1st Cir. 2001); see also United States v. Sposito, 106 F.3d\n\n1042, 1046 (1st Cir. 1997) (\"The proper interpretation of the\n\nFederal Rules of Evidence is a question of law and is reviewed de\n\nnovo, but the application of [a rule] . . . is reviewed under an\n\nabuse-of-discretion standard.\") (citations omitted); United States\n\nv. Paulino, 13 F.3d 20, 25 (1st Cir. 1994) (\"The court of appeals\n\nreviews a trial judge's admission of evidence over a hearsay\n\nobjection only for abuse of discretion.\"); Alexis v. McDonald's\n\nRests. of Mass., Inc., 67 F.3d 341, 347 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"Rulings\n\non the admissibility of lay opinion testimony are reviewed only for\nmanifest abuse of discretion.\") (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThus,   we   should    reverse      the   district     court's   ruling   \"if   we\n\ndetermine     that    the   judge    'committed        a   meaningful   error   in\njudgment.'\"     Ruiz-Troche v. Pepsi Cola of P.R. Bottling Co., 161\n\nF.3d 77, 83 (1st Cir. 1998) (quoting Anderson v. Cryovac, Inc., 862\n\nF.2d 910, 923 (1st Cir. 1988)).\n\n             Finally, we review de novo L.L. Bean's contention that\n\nthe district court erroneously instructed the jury on the law\n\nrelating to systemic violations.                See Romano v. U-Haul Int'l, 233\n\nF.3d 655, 665 (1st Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 122 S. Ct. 41 (2001).\n\n\"[T]he giving of [a jury] instruction is reversible error only if\n\nit (1) was misleading, unduly complicating, or incorrect as a\n\n\n\n                                          -7-\n\fmatter of law, and (2) adversely affected the objecting party's\n\nsubstantial rights.\"           Rodowicz, 279 F.3d at 42.\n\n\n\n                                    III.   DISCUSSION\n\nA. Judgment as a Matter of Law\n\n              L.L.    Bean     challenges     the    jury   verdict    as    to   both\nCrowley's hostile work environment claim and her systemic sex\n\ndiscrimination claim.           It contends that Crowley failed to present\n\nsufficient evidence to support either of the jury's findings.\n\nCrowley argues, however, that L.L. Bean has not met its demanding\n\nburden of demonstrating that no reasonable jury, presented with the\n\nevidence adduced at trial, could have found L.L. Bean liable for\n\nmaintaining a hostile work environment and committing a systemic\nviolation.\n\n              1. Hostile Work Environment Claim\n\n              Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides, in\nrelevant part, that \"[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice\n\nfor an employer . . . to discriminate against any individual with\nrespect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of\n\nemployment, because of such individual's race, color, religion,\n\nsex, or national origin.\"             42 U.S.C. § 2000e-2(a)(1).       The Supreme\n\nCourt   has    stated        that   \"'[t]he   phrase    \"terms,   conditions,          or\n\nprivileges of employment\" evinces a congressional intent to strike\n\nat the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in\n\nemployment,'         which    includes     requiring    people    to   work       in    a\n\ndiscriminatorily        hostile      or    abusive   environment.\"          Harris     v.\n\n                                           -8-\n\fForklift Sys., 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S. Ct. 367, 370 (1993) (some\n\ninternal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB\n\nv. Vinson, 477 U.S. 57, 64, 106 S. Ct. 2399, 2404 (1986)).             \"When\nthe   workplace   is   permeated     with   discriminatory      intimidation,\n\nridicule, and insult that is sufficiently severe or pervasive to\n\nalter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an\nabusive working environment, Title VII is violated.\"               Oncale v.\n\nSundowner Offshore Servs., 523 U.S. 75, 78, 118 S. Ct. 998, 1001\n\n(1998) (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Harris, 510 U.S.\n\nat 21, 114 S. Ct. at 370).\n\n             To prove a claim of hostile work environment sexual\n\nharassment, a plaintiff must establish:\n\n             (1) that she (or he) is a member of a\n             protected class; (2) that she was subjected to\n             unwelcome sexual harassment; (3) that the\n             harassment was based upon sex; (4) that the\n             harassment   was    sufficiently    severe   or\n             pervasive so as to alter the conditions of\n             plaintiff's employment and create an abusive\n             work    environment;    (5)    that    sexually\n             objectionable conduct was both objectively and\n             subjectively offensive, such that a reasonable\n             person would find it hostile or abusive and\n             the victim in fact did perceive it to be so;\n             and (6) that some basis for employer liability\n             has been established.\n\nO'Rourke v. City of Providence, 235 F.3d 713, 728 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\nL.L. Bean asserts that Crowley presented insufficient evidence at\n\ntrial to satisfy three elements of her hostile work environment\n\nclaim   --   namely,   that   Crowley      perceived   Juhl's    behavior    as\n\n\"subjectively     abusive,\"   that    Juhl's    conduct   was    \"severe    and\n\npervasive,\" and that L.L. Bean knew or should have known about\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fJuhl's alleged harassment, but failed to take prompt or appropriate\n\naction to remedy the situation.                  Br. of Appellant at 18-31.\n\n              Before addressing the specifics of each claim, however,\nit   is    important      to   point      out    that   L.L.   Bean    predicates      its\n\nargument      on    two     critical       suppositions:          (1)       Title    VII's\n\nadministrative       filing         requirements        precluded     the     jury    from\nconsidering allegations of harassment that occurred before February\n\n24, 1998; and (2) the jury's verdict on the state law claim\n\nestablished that Crowley was not harassed after June 22, 1998.\n\nThus, L.L. Bean effectively seeks to cabin Crowley's claim to the\n\nend that it is based only on events occurring during a four-month\n\nperiod. L.L. Bean then argues that the \"handful of incidents\" that\n\noccurred during that four-month period between February 24, 1998,\nand June 22, 1998, are insufficient to support the jury's verdict.\n\nBr. of Appellant at 6.\n\n              The Supreme Court's recent decision in National Railroad\n\nPassenger Corp. v. Morgan, --- U.S. ---, 122 S. Ct. 2061 (2002),\n\nseverely undermines L.L. Bean's argument.                      In Morgan, the Court\n\nheld that \"consideration of the entire scope of a hostile work\n\nenvironment claim, including behavior alleged outside the statutory\n\ntime      period,   is    permissible           for   the   purposes     of    assessing\n\nliability,     so    long      as   any    act     contributing     to   that       hostile\n\nenvironment takes place within the statutory time period.\"                           Id. at\n\n---, 122 S. Ct. at 2068.             The Court explained that a \"hostile work\n\nenvironment claim is comprised of a series of separate acts that\n\ncollectively constitute one 'unlawful employment practice.'\" Id. at\n\n                                            -10-\n\f---,   122    S.   Ct.   at   2074.     Thus,       \"[p]rovided       that    an   act\n\ncontributing to the claim occurs within the filing period, the\n\nentire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by\nthe court for the purposes of determining liability.\"                   Id.\n\n             Therefore, in the wake of Morgan, the jury not only could\n\nconsider Juhl's conduct prior to February 24, 1998, as \"relevant\nbackground evidence,\" United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans, 431 U.S.\n\n553, 558, 97 S. Ct. 1885, 1889 (1977), but also could hold L.L.\n\nBean liable for the alleged acts of harassment that fell outside\n\nthe    300-day     period     for   filing     an     EEOC    charge    of    sexual\n\ndiscrimination      provided    that   it     found    that   there    was    an   act\n\ncontributing to the hostile environment within the 300-day filing\n\nperiod.3     Notwithstanding the thrust of L.L. Bean's argument that\nCrowley's allegations of harassment included only \"a few brief\n\nencounters\" between her and Juhl that were \"scarcely threatening,\"\n\nBr. of Appellant at 24, 31, Crowley offered evidence at trial\nestablishing that Juhl's harassment began in the fall of 1996 and\n\ncontinued into July 1998, and thus L.L. Bean's argument is flawed.\n\nConsequently, we must review all such evidence offered at trial\n\nwhen determining whether the jury verdict is supported by the\n\nevidence.\n\n             As we have indicated, L.L. Bean also asserts that we must\n\ndisregard any evidence of sexual harassment on or after June 22,\n\n1998, because the jury found that it had not violated the Maine\n\n\n  3\n   The parties agree that the 300-day filing period was\napplicable here with regard to the Title VII claim.\n\n                                       -11-\n\fHuman Rights Act by sexually discriminating against her by acts\n\noccurring on or after that date. Although this evidence appears to\n\nbe of limited significance inasmuch as Crowley alleges only a few\nincidents of alleged harassment by Juhl after June 22, 1998, L.L.\n\nBean is wrong on this point, too.     In basing its argument on the\n\nportion of the jury's verdict that L.L. Bean had not sexually\ndiscriminated against Crowley on or after June 22, 1998, L.L. Bean\n\nassumes that the jury concluded that the hostile work environment\n\nceased to exist on June 22, 1998.\n\n          But the jury's determination that L.L. Bean was not\n\nliable for maintaining a hostile work environment under the state\n\nstatute based solely on incidents that occurred on or after June 22\n\ndoes not mean that the jury was -- and, therefore, this court is --\nprecluded from considering any evidence relating to Juhl's post-\n\nJune 22 conduct when determining L.L. Bean's liability under Title\n\nVII.   As Crowley argues in her brief, \"[t]he fact that the number\nof incidents from June 23 forward do not constitute a violation of\n\nstate law by themselves has no logical connection to whether those\n\nincidents can be considered, together with earlier incidents, under\n\nfederal law.\"   Br. of Appellee at 17.\n\n          Moreover, L.L. Bean draws too many conclusions from the\n\njury's verdict.   For instance, the jury may have found for L.L.\n\nBean on the state law claim because it concluded that Crowley had\n\nnot satisfied the employer liability element of the hostile work\n\nenvironment claim (perhaps because it decided that L.L. Bean\n\nfinally took appropriate remedial measures to end the hostile work\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fenvironment on or after June 22, 1998), not because the jury\n\nbelieved that Crowley failed to prove that Juhl's conduct on or\n\nafter June 22, 1998, was \"severe or pervasive.\"    In other words,\nthe jury may have believed that Crowley was subject to a hostile\n\nwork environment on or after June 22, 1998, but that L.L. Bean\n\nnevertheless should not be held liable for Juhl's conduct on or\nafter that date.    Because we have no way of knowing the jury's\n\nreason for rendering its verdict on the state law claim, L.L.\n\nBean's argument that we cannot consider evidence relating to events\n\non or after June 22, 1998, must fail.   Therefore, we will consider\n\nall of the evidence offered at trial regarding Juhl's harassment\n\nfrom the fall of 1996 through July of 1998 in determining whether\n\nthe evidence supports the jury's verdict that L.L. Bean maintained\na hostile work environment.\n\n                   a. Subjectively Abusive\n\n          L.L. Bean first argues that the jury's verdict should be\noverturned because Crowley did not offer any evidence demonstrating\n\nthat Juhl's conduct was \"subjectively abusive.\"    It asserts that\n\"[s]ince Crowley did not believe that Juhl was sexually harassing\n\nher until June 23, 1998, . . . Crowley did not subjectively believe\n\nthat she was being subjected to a hostile work environment during\n\nthe statutory period.\"    Br. of Appellant at 19 (citations to the\n\nrecord omitted).     L.L. Bean seizes on the June 23, 1998 date\n\nbecause Crowley testified that until that date, she thought the\n\nteam leaders adequately were taking care of the Juhl situation and\n\ntherefore she had no complaints regarding what L.L. Bean was doing.\n\n                                -13-\n\f            We reject this argument, as L.L. Bean misapprehends what\n\nCrowley was required to \"subjectively perceive.\" As Crowley points\n\nout in her brief, although the victim must subjectively perceive\nthe harasser's conduct to be \"hostile or abusive,\" the victim need\n\nnot subjectively believe that the conduct met the legal definition\n\nof unlawful sexual harassment.            See Br. of Appellee at 14.          At\ntrial, Crowley testified that she was frightened and feared for her\n\nsafety because Juhl was stalking her.              See Tr. 94, 109 (she was\n\n\"scared\"); 93 (she \"was scared to death\"); 123, 127, 131 (she was\n\n\"shaking\"); 127 (she \"was breaking down\"); 130 (she \"felt real\n\nshaky inside\"); 146 (she was \"[r]eally upset\"); 135 (she \"felt like\n\n[she] was going to get hurt\").           Furthermore, Crowley offered into\n\nevidence a copy of L.L. Bean's written warning to Juhl, in which it\ninformed Juhl that he has \"created a hostile environment in which\n\n[Crowley] felt physically threatened.\"             App. 99.\n\n            Therefore, although Crowley may not have realized until\nJune    1998   that    Juhl's       conduct   actually      constituted   sexual\n\nharassment, she did present evidence establishing that she earlier\n\nconsidered Juhl's behavior threatening and hostile.                 Consequently,\n\ncontrary to L.L. Bean's assertion, Crowley presented sufficient\n\nevidence for a rational jury to find that she perceived Juhl's\n\nconduct to be \"hostile or abusive.\"\n\n                      b. Severe or Pervasive\n\n            L.L. Bean next argues that Crowley's \"eight encounters\"\n\nwith Juhl during the four-month period were not objectively \"severe\n\nand    pervasive\"     enough   to    create   a   hostile    work   environment,\n\n                                       -14-\n\finsisting that Crowley's allegations \"'are so trivial, so isolated,\n\nand so far from the paradigmatic case of sexual harassment' that\n\njudgment as a matter of law is 'clearly appropriate.'\" Br. of\nAppellant at 20-21 (quoting Hartsell v. Duplex Prod., Inc., 123\n\nF.3d 766, 773 (4th Cir. 1997)).         L.L. Bean contends that Crowley's\n\nhostile work environment claim is supported merely by\n             evidence that Juhl gave her a book, came to\n             the wrong building where she was working on\n             three occasions, operated his machine in her\n             vicinity on occasion (and told her once 'it\n             will cost you' when she asked him to move),\n             and came out of a tunnel dancing on one\n             occasion.\n\nReply Br. of Appellant at 9.        As we explained above, Morgan fatally\n\nundermines this argument, for Crowley's allegations do not merely\n\ninclude eight incidents, but involve alleged acts of harassment and\nstalking that spanned nearly one and a half years. Accordingly, we\n\nwill review evidence relating to all of Crowley's allegations --\n\nnot just those of acts that occurred between February 24, 1998, and\nJune   22,   1998   --   to     determine    whether   Juhl's   conduct   was\n\nsufficiently     \"severe      or   pervasive\"   to   constitute   actionable\n\nharassment.\n\n             Crowley presented the following evidence to support her\n\nhostile work environment claim.             In 1996, at an L.L. Bean pool\n\nparty, Juhl grabbed her foot and massaged it against her will.             He\n\ntold her that she was the \"perfect woman\" and that she had \"perfect\n\nwomen's feet.\"      Juhl also gave Crowley gifts intended to let her\n\nknow that he was watching her both at and outside of work.           He even\n\nfollowed her home one evening by turning off his headlights and\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\fpursuing her car in the dark.         At an L.L. Bean party in December\n\n1996, he again stated that Crowley was the perfect woman and\n\npinpointed the exact location of her house on a map, letting her\nknow that he knew exactly where she lived.        Crowley reported these\n\nincidents to her team leader, David Baker.\n\n           In January 1997, Juhl followed Crowley at work and\nbothered her, sometimes lurking in the dark outside the women's\n\nbathroom while he waited for her to emerge.         He often parked next\n\nto her car in the parking lot and followed her to her car when she\n\nwas leaving work.      He also used L.L. Bean's hand-held computer\n\nunits to track Crowley's movement within the warehouse.                Juhl\n\nfrequently blocked her in the aisles and forced her to squeeze by\n\nhim.   Crowley reported all of these incidents to her supervisor,\nTim Marong, who remarked that Juhl was stalking her.\n\n           On February 16, 1997, Juhl broke into Crowley's home\n\nwhile she was there.        He tried to get her to touch his clothing,\nand he grabbed her wrists in an attempt to bring her upstairs with\n\nhim.   He not only told her that he wanted to date her, but admitted\n\nthat he had been at her house previously and described what outfits\n\nshe had been wearing on those occasions.          Crowley explained that\n\nshe had a boyfriend, but Juhl responded, \"but he's never here.\"\n\nAfter he finally left, Crowley saw him outside peering in different\n\nwindows of her house.       She hid in the bathroom until he left.\n\n           As   she   had    done   previously,   Crowley   reported   this\n\nincident to her supervisors.           She told her team leaders, her\n\nsupervisor Tim Marong, and L.L. Bean's Human Resources personnel\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fthat she believed she was being stalked.          Indeed, Marong testified\n\nthat he thought that Juhl's conduct could have constituted sexual\n\nharassment. Marong contacted Pat Bressette-Long, a Human Resources\nsupervisor, who met with Crowley several weeks later.              Crowley\n\ninformed Bressette-Long not only about Juhl's uninvited entry into\n\nher home, but also about his intimidating behavior at work.              When\nCrowley asked whether she should notify the plant manager, Frank\n\nJohnson, about Juhl's conduct, Bressette-Long advised her not to\n\nbreak   the    chain   of   command,   but   to   continue   reporting   her\n\ncomplaints to her immediate supervisor.            One month after Crowley\n\nmet with Bressette-Long, Juhl was reassigned to a separate work\n\narea.\n\n              From March 1997 until the summer of 1997, Juhl continued\nto work near Crowley, even when he was scheduled to work elsewhere.\n\nHe also continued his familiar conduct of blocking her in the\n\naisles with his transtacker and dancing near her.             She reported\nJuhl's disturbing and sometimes bizarre behavior to her team leader\n\nand Human Resources, which assured her that Juhl would be scheduled\n\nto work in a different warehouse.             Despite these assurances,\n\nhowever, in May 1997, L.L. Bean permitted Juhl to volunteer to work\n\nshifts in her warehouse.\n\n              During the summer of 1997, Juhl's conduct did not change,\n\nas he kept trying to be near Crowley.             He not only continued to\n\ncorner her and make her ask him to move out of the way, but also\n\nbegan hiding in dark areas of the warehouse where Crowley would\n\ncome upon him.     Crowley notified her team leader, Leo Davis, about\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fJuhl's conduct, but he did nothing, even though he promised to\n\ninvestigate the matter.             Meanwhile, Juhl's behavior continued\n\nunabated.    In July 1997, he appeared unexpectedly in her work area\n15 or more times, lingered around the time clock at the end of\n\nCrowley's shift, and stood close to her on numerous occasions.\n\n             During the fall and early winter of 1997, Crowley saw\nJuhl so often in her work area that she assumed that they were\n\nworking the same shift.        She later learned that Juhl actually was\n\nworking the wrong shift with management's knowledge.                     Co-workers\n\nalso noticed Juhl's conduct, prompting one witness to remark,\n\n\"Wherever she was, he was.\"                 In fact, one L.L. Bean witness\n\ntestified that he believed Juhl was sexually attracted to Crowley,\n\nexplaining    that     \"it   was    kind     of   obvious   the   way    he   handled\nhimself.\"\n\n             In January 1998, Crowley briefly was assigned to work an\n\n8:00 a.m.-4:30 p.m. shift and therefore maintained little contact\nwith Juhl.        This respite was short-lived, however, for L.L. Bean\n\nsoon placed her back on the third shift with Juhl.                      She notified\n\nher supervisor, Bob Anderson, that she was scared and asked for a\n\nparking space closer to the building so that she would not be alone\n\nwith Juhl.    Anderson stated that he was aware of her problems with\n\nJuhl, but that he had to put her back on Juhl's shift for business\n\nreasons.\n\n             In     February       1998,     Juhl's    contact     with       Crowley\n\nintensified.       He gave her a book on holistic cancer therapy after\n\nher friend's mother died of cancer.                Crowley maintains that Juhl\n\n\n                                           -18-\n\fcould have known about the death of her friend's mother only by\n\nfollowing Crowley.      Crowley   told   her   team   leaders   about   the\n\nincident and reported that he had grabbed her hands when he tried\nto give her the book.   Juhl also drove his transtacker up and down\n\nthe aisle, shadowing her movements in the adjacent aisle, and used\n\nhis transtacker to block her in aisles.         Crowley reported these\nincidents to her team leaders, David Baker and Steve McCourt, who\n\nassured her that L.L. Bean was taking her concerns seriously.\n\n            In March 1998, L.L. Bean consolidated the first and third\n\nshifts of its distributions operation and consequently transferred\n\nJuhl to the morning shift.    Despite being assigned to a different\n\nbuilding, Juhl showed up at Crowley's building on March 30 and 31,\n\nand April 1, 1998.       As one co-worker testified, Juhl \"would\nconstantly show up in the wrong building\" during March and April\n\n1998, and \"was constantly following her all the time, he never\n\nstopped.\"\n            In April 1998, Juhl continued showing up in Crowley's\n\nwork area, following her, and physically obstructing her from doing\n\nher work.     One time, he danced in the aisle in front of her.\n\nAnother time, he prevented her from passing, and when she asked him\n\nto let her by, he responded that it would \"cost her.\"       When Crowley\n\nreported these incidents to her new team leader, Peter Farley, he\n\njoked about Juhl's conduct and referred to him as her \"little\n\nstalker.\"\n\n            From April until June 1998, Crowley's interaction with\n\nJuhl was limited, as the two worked on different shifts.                Juhl\n\n\n                                  -19-\n\fnevertheless loitered around the time clock and the warehouse\n\nentrance, waiting for Crowley to come and go.         On June 22, 1998,\n\nJuhl was returned to Crowley's shift.       Shortly thereafter, Juhl\nlapsed back into his familiar pattern of behavior, blocking her in\n\nthe aisles, making her beg him to move, and forcing her to squeeze\n\nby him.\n          On June 23, 1998, a team leader, Leo Davis, witnessed\n\nJuhl blocking Crowley, but did nothing.          Instead, Davis laughed\n\nwith Juhl in front of Crowley and then looked at her, smiled, and\n\nleft. Furthermore, Ken Libby, a fellow employee, warned supervisor\n\nAnderson that Crowley would end up dead if someone did not do\n\nsomething to stop Juhl.    In addition, Bennett Schlaack, a trainer,\n\nadvised three team leaders -- John Andretta, Steve McCourt, and\nDavid Baker -- that Juhl was shadowing Crowley and that he was\n\nconcerned for her safety.       L.L. Bean, however, took no action.\n\nFrustrated with L.L. Bean's ineffectiveness in protecting her from\nJuhl, Crowley went to the police a few days after Davis saw Juhl\n\nblock Crowley.\n\n          In the meantime, Leo Davis was assigned to investigate a\n\nconfrontation between Crowley and Juhl that occurred on the same\n\nday that Davis witnessed Juhl blocking Crowley.       Aside from Davis,\n\ntwo other employees witnessed the incident and reported the matter\n\nto management.     Crowley explained to Davis that Juhl's conduct was\n\nlongstanding, but Davis indicated to her that L.L. Bean \"had to\n\nprotect   Paul's     rights.\"     During   the     course   of   Davis's\n\ninvestigation, Crowley was restricted to the dock area, while Juhl\n\n\n                                 -20-\n\fenjoyed full access to the warehouse.     Notwithstanding Crowley's\n\ncomplaints, management made no effort to keep Juhl away from\n\nCrowley.\n           On June 30, 1998, L.L. Bean issued a written warning to\n\nJuhl, stating that he had \"created a hostile work environment in\n\nwhich   [Crowley]   felt   physically   threatened\"   and   that   his\n\"threatening, intimidating behavior will not be tolerated.\"        The\n\nwarning indicated that Juhl \"must take action to avoid further\n\ncontact with Eileen Crowley.\"     The Human Resources official who\n\nissued the warning, Rebecca Batchelder, testified that she did not\n\nknow that L.L. Bean already had issued a directive in the spring of\n\n1997 requiring that Juhl and Crowley work in separate buildings.\n\n           During Davis's investigation when Crowley and Juhl were\nseparated at work and even after Juhl received his written warning\n\ninstructing him to stay away from Crowley, Juhl continued following\n\nCrowley around at work.     Sometime after June 24, 1998, Crowley\nagain complained to her team leader, Peter Farley, that Juhl was\n\nviolating the standing order that he and Crowley be kept separated,\n\nbut Farley took no action other than to suggest that Crowley have\n\nher boyfriend give Juhl a \"blanket party.\"    On July 7, 1998, after\n\nFarley again allowed Juhl and Crowley to work in the same area,\n\nCrowley returned to the police department and obtained a temporary\n\nprotection order against Juhl.     The police served Juhl with the\n\norder at work on the same day.\n\n           Thereafter, L.L. Bean placed Juhl on paid leave pending\n\nthe court hearing on Crowley's request for a protection order.      On\n\n\n                                 -21-\n\fJuly 17, 1998, Crowley obtained a permanent court protection order\n\nagainst Juhl.       On July 24, 1998, L.L. Bean terminated Juhl's\n\nemployment.\n            As is quite evident, Crowley presented evidence relating\n\nto more than just eight innocuous encounters between her and Juhl.\n\nIn fact, she provided ample evidence to establish that Juhl engaged\nin a longstanding pattern of hostile and intimidating behavior\n\ntowards her that spanned over one and a half years.                 To prevail on\n\nthis appeal, L.L. Bean must demonstrate that no reasonable person\n\ncould have reached the conclusion of the jury, even after viewing\n\nall of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict.\n\nBased on the evidence adduced at trial, it cannot be said that a\n\nreasonable person could not have concluded that Juhl's conduct\ntowards Crowley was \"severe or pervasive.\"                Indeed, as the EEOC\n\nwrote in its amicus brief, \"by focusing only on the specific\n\nincidents which occurred after February 24, Bean fails to capture\nthe   residual     and   cumulative       effect   that   Juhl's     campaign    of\n\nharassment had on Crowley's working conditions even on days when\n\nshe   did   not    encounter      him.\"      Amicus   Br.    of    EEOC   at    21.\n\nConsequently, Crowley presented sufficient evidence at trial to\n\nsatisfy this element of her hostile work environment claim.\n\n                     c. Employer Liability\n\n            L.L. Bean finally argues with respect to the hostile work\n\nenvironment claim that Crowley failed to offer sufficient evidence\n\nto establish employer liability.           Although this appears to be L.L.\n\nBean's   best     argument   to    the    extent   that     it    challenges    the\n\n                                      -22-\n\fsufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, it nevertheless\n\nis unable to meet the onerous burden of proving that a reasonable\n\nperson could not have concluded that, after it learned of Juhl's\nbehavior, it failed to take appropriate steps to stop Juhl's\n\nharassment and stalking of Crowley.\n\n           A   plaintiff   must     satisfy    different      standards    for\nestablishing employer liability in a hostile work environment case\n\ndepending on whether the harasser is a supervisor or co-employee of\n\nthe victim.    In this case, it is beyond dispute that Juhl and\n\nCrowley were co-employees.        To establish employer liability for a\n\nnon-supervisory co-employee, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the\n\nemployer   \"'knew   or   should    have    known   of   the   charged   sexual\n\nharassment and failed to implement prompt and appropriate action.'\"\nWhite, 221 F.3d at 261 (quoting Blankenship v. Parke Care Ctrs.,\n\nInc., 123 F.3d 868, 872 (6th Cir. 1997)).          L.L. Bean maintains that\n\nCrowley did not present sufficient evidence to satisfy either\nprong.\n\n                    i. Whether L.L. Bean Knew or Should Have Known\n\n           The evidence offered at trial, if viewed in the light\n\nmost favorable to Crowley, clearly supports a jury finding that\n\nL.L. Bean knew or should have known that Juhl was harassing and\n\nstalking Crowley.     L.L. Bean bases its misguided argument to the\n\ncontrary on its restricted temporal view of the evidence, but as we\n\nexplained above, the statute of limitations did not preclude the\n\njury -- and therefore does not preclude us -- from considering\n\nevidence relating to harassment before February 24, 1998, and the\n\n                                    -23-\n\fjury verdict on the state law claim does not preclude us from\n\nconsidering evidence relating to harassment on or after June 22,\n\n1998.   Therefore, we must consider all of the evidence, from 1996\nuntil July 1998, to determine whether it was sufficient to support\n\na jury finding that L.L. Bean knew about Juhl's conduct.\n\n           Crowley presented ample evidence that she reported Juhl's\nbehavior to her team leaders, supervisors, and Human Resources.\n\nCrowley   began   notifying   her    supervisors   of   Juhl's   disturbing\n\nbehavior in 1996, when she informed her team leader, David Baker,\n\nthat Juhl was harassing and following her both on and off L.L.\n\nBean's premises.    In January 1997, she told her team leader, John\n\nAndretta, and her supervisor, Tim Marong, that Juhl was bothering\n\nher at work, tracking her movements with the hand-held computers,\nwaiting for her in the dark outside the women's bathroom, blocking\n\nher in the aisles with his transtacker, and forcing her to squeeze\n\nby him.    After Juhl broke into her home in February 1997, she\nreported the incident to team leaders Andretta and Steve McCourt,\n\nsupervisor Marong, and Human Resources.\n\n           In the spring of 1997, Crowley advised her new team\n\nleader, Baker, that Juhl was continuing to show up in her building\n\nand block her in the aisles.        In April and May 1997, after Crowley\n\ntwice told Human Resources about Juhl's stalking behavior, Human\n\nResources assured her Juhl would be scheduled for work in a\n\ndifferent warehouse.\n\n           In the summer of 1997, Crowley notified her team leader,\n\nLeo Davis, that Juhl always was trying to be near her and that he\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\fhid in the dark, waiting for her to come upon him.     In September\n\n1997, she told her team leader, Keith Menard, that Juhl was showing\n\nup repeatedly in her work area, even though he was working a\ndifferent shift.\n\n            In January 1998, after being put back on the first shift\n\nwith Juhl, Crowley informed her supervisor, Bob Anderson, that she\nwas scared of Juhl and had concerns about working on the same shift\n\nwith him.   In February 1998, Crowley reported to her team leaders,\n\nBaker and McCourt, that Juhl was shadowing her movements in his\n\ntranstacker. During L.L. Bean's shift consolidation in March 1998,\n\nCrowley complained to Baker that Juhl had come to the wrong\n\nbuilding three days in a row.\n\n            In April 1998, Crowley told her new team leader, Peter\nFarley, that Juhl was physically blocking her from doing her work,\n\nbut Farley laughed about Juhl's behavior and referred to him as her\n\n\"little stalker.\"    In late June 1998, Crowley again complained to\nFarley that Juhl was violating the standing directive that he and\n\nCrowley be kept separated at work, but Farley did nothing to remedy\n\nthe situation.      In July 1998, after Juhl was issued a written\n\nwarning requiring him to stay away from Crowley but before L.L.\n\nBean placed him on unpaid leave, Farley allowed Juhl to work in\n\nCrowley's vicinity despite her previous complaints.\n\n            In addition to Crowley's repeated complaints to her team\n\nleaders and supervisors about Juhl's conduct, Crowley's co-workers\n\nalso reported Juhl's behavior and expressed their concerns for her\n\nsafety. See, e.g., Sims v. Health Midwest Physicians Servs. Corp.,\n\n\n                                -25-\n\f196   F.3d    915,   921       (8th   Cir.   1999)      (\"Notification        of    sexual\n\nharassment to an employer need not come solely from the victim of\n\nthe harassment for knowledge to be imputed to the employer.\"). For\ninstance, Ken Libby, a fellow employee, warned supervisor Anderson\n\nthat Crowley would end up dead if someone did not do something to\n\nstop Juhl.     Another fellow employee, Alan Coffin, alerted Anderson\nto Juhl's odd practice of dancing near Crowley.                             In addition,\n\nBennett      Schlaack,     a    trainer,     advised         three   team    leaders    --\n\nAndretta, McCourt, and Baker -- that Juhl was shadowing Crowley and\n\nthat he was concerned for her safety.\n\n              Furthermore, Crowley presented evidence that L.L. Bean\n\nmanagers, team leaders, and supervisors were aware of Juhl's\n\nconduct and that at times they even characterized it as harassment.\nFor example, after Juhl broke into Crowley's home in February 1997,\n\nCrowley spoke with both her supervisor, Tim Marong, and a Human\n\nResources supervisor, Pat Bressette-Long. Marong's memo notes that\nCrowley \"felt that Paul was stalking her,\" and Bressette-Long's\n\nhand-written notes state that \"Eileen Crowley feels like she is\n\nbeing stalked.\"      The Security Department investigated a complaint\n\nCrowley advanced in May 1997 and described her grievance as a\n\n\"sexual      harassment        complaint\"    in    a    document      distributed       to\n\n\"management\" -- specifically, to manager Tim Parker. After Crowley\n\nasked her supervisor, Bob Anderson, to put her back on the first\n\nshift in      January     1998    because    she       was    concerned     about    Juhl,\n\nAnderson sent an email to other management personnel stating that\n\neveryone was fully aware of the situation between Crowley and Juhl.\n\n\n                                         -26-\n\fCrowley's team leader, John Andretta, testified at trial that \"it\n\nwas obvious everybody knew of the Juhl/Eileen situation and how he\n\nwas following her around, always being where she was.\"                        Finally,\nthe written warning to Juhl on June 30, 1998, indicated that he had\n\n\"created     a   hostile   work    environment       in   which    [Crowley]        felt\n\nphysically threatened\" and that his \"threatening, intimidating\nbehavior will not be tolerated.\"\n\n             At bottom, L.L. Bean's contention that Crowley did not\n\nproperly     notify    management      of     her     complaints       because       she\n\n\"bypass[ed] the reporting requirements under L.L. Bean's harassment\n\npolicies,\" Br. of Appellant at 28, is without merit, for Crowley\n\nand her co-workers repeatedly alerted team leaders and supervisors\n\nabout Juhl's conduct.        L.L. Bean representatives admitted that the\nproper procedure for an employee to report a claim of harassment\n\nwas to notify his or her team leader.               Once a team leader received\n\na complaint from an employee, it was the team leader's duty to\nreport the complaint up the chain of command to his or her\n\nsupervisor.       Therefore, by maintaining a policy that permitted\n\nworkers to report sexual harassment claims to team leaders, L.L.\n\nBean provided these team leaders with actual authority to receive\n\nnotice of sexual harassment complaints on behalf of the company,\n\nand their knowledge was imputed to it.               See, e.g., Sims, 196 F.3d\n\nat    920   (stating     that     \"employer    liability         could   attach      if\n\ninformation of the harassment had come to the attention of someone\n\nwho   is    reasonably     believed   to    have     a    duty    to   pass    on   the\n\ninformation\").      As such, Crowley provided sufficient evidence for\n\n                                      -27-\n\fa reasonable jury to find that L.L. Bean knew or should have known\n\nabout Juhl's harassment.\n\n                    ii. Whether L.L. Bean Took Prompt and Appropriate\n                    Action\n\n             L.L. Bean contends that the evidence offered at trial did\nnot support a jury finding that it failed to take prompt and\n\nappropriate remedial action after receiving Crowley's complaints.\n\nIn fact, it asserts that \"[w]hen Crowley conveyed her concerns\n\npreviously to a supervisor or a human resources representative,\n\nL.L. Bean took immediate action.\"        Br. of Appellant at 28.   L.L.\n\nBean argues:\n\n             Ultimately, Crowley's argument boils down to a\n             claim that L.L. Bean is strictly liable for\n             any encounter between Crowley and Juhl because\n             its prior warnings to Juhl to stay away from\n             Crowley and not to bother her, and its prior\n             actions in separating them, were not 100\n             percent effective in preventing Crowley and\n             Juhl from ever crossing paths again. Suffice\n             it to say, this is not the law.\n\nId. at 31.\n\n             To be sure, reasonable jurors might have agreed with L.L.\n\nBean's argument that, although its remedial actions were not 100%\n\neffective, it did take prompt and appropriate action and therefore\n\nshould not be liable for Juhl's unlawful conduct.        There is some\n\nforce to its argument that inasmuch as Crowley actually conceded in\n\nher testimony that she was pleased with L.L. Bean's responses to\n\nher complaints prior to June 23, 1998,4 it should escape liability.\n\n\n  4\n      At trial, the following exchange occurred:\n\n                  Attorney.      And so until June 23, 1998, you\n\n                                  -28-\n\fSee Br. of Appellant at 28.   Having said that, however, we do not\n\nreview the jury's findings de novo, but instead must uphold the\n\njury verdict unless no reasonable person could have reached its\nconclusion.\n\n           The jury obviously concluded that L.L. Bean did not take\n\nprompt and appropriate action to protect Crowley from Juhl, and\nthis conclusion was not unreasonable.    Aside from suspending and\n\neventually terminating Juhl after Crowley obtained a permanent\n\ncourt protection order against him, the only significant remedial\n\naction L.L. Bean ever took to protect Crowley from Juhl was to\n\nschedule Crowley and Juhl in different buildings or on different\n\nshifts.    For instance, after Juhl broke into Crowley's home in\n\nFebruary 1997, Human Resources ordered that Juhl and Crowley be\nkept separated.   Then, after disregarding numerous complaints by\n\nCrowley over the ensuing year and a half, L.L. Bean finally issued\n\na written warning to Juhl in June 1998 for \"creat[ing] a hostile\n\n\n\n                               thought the team leaders were doing\n                               enough to take care of the\n                               situation with Mr. Juhl; is that\n                               fair to say?\n\n                Crowley:       Yes.\n\n                Attorney:      And so you did not have complaints\n                               with what L.L. Bean was doing up\n                               until June 23, 1998?\n\n                Crowley:       Yes.\n\nTr. 198.\n\n\n\n                               -29-\n\fwork environment in which [Crowley] felt physically threatened\" and\n\nordered him to \"take action to avoid further contact with Eileen\n\nCrowley.\"     In short, L.L. Bean adopted the same remedial action in\nJune 1998 as it had in February 1997, even though (1) the earlier\n\naction    had    proven     ineffective,         (2)     Crowley      repeatedly    had\n\ncomplained to her team leaders and supervisors that Juhl wantonly\nignored the directive, (3) supervisors often failed to abide by the\n\npolicy and permitted Juhl and Crowley to work together, and (4) the\n\ncumulative effect of Juhl's conduct over the year-and-a-half period\n\nonly had exacerbated the hostile work environment in which Crowley\n\nwas forced to work.\n\n              Consequently, although L.L. Bean may have made a good\n\nfaith effort to implement an effective remedial measure in February\n1997,    it   could   not    turn     a    blind   eye      towards     the   measure's\n\nineffectiveness over the following 18 months, only to reinstitute\n\nthe same inadequate remedial measure in response to its finding\nthat Juhl had subjected Crowley to a hostile work environment.\n\nThus,    based   on   L.L.    Bean's       pattern     of    indifference       towards\n\nCrowley's complaints about Juhl between February 1997 and June\n\n1998, it cannot be said that a reasonable jury could not find that\n\nL.L. Bean failed to take prompt and appropriate action to protect\n\nCrowley from Juhl.\n\n              Furthermore, notwithstanding L.L. Bean's assertion that\n\nit   \"took    immediate     action\"       in   response     to   each    of   Crowley's\n\ncomplaints, Crowley offered ample testimony supporting her position\n\nthat L.L. Bean ignored many complaints she and her co-workers\n\n\n                                          -30-\n\fsubmitted concerning Juhl's behavior.               Rather than reiterate each\n\ninstance    in   which   L.L.   Bean    failed      to   respond   to   Crowley's\n\ncomplaints, we simply will direct the parties to our summary of the\nevidence above.      See supra Part III.A.1.b.            There, one will see\n\nthat L.L. Bean did not respond to Crowley's complaints to Human\n\nResources in May 1997, to Leo Davis in the summer of 1997, to Bob\nAnderson in January 1998, to David Baker and Steve McCourt in\n\nFebruary 1998, to Peter Farley in April 1998, to Leo Davis again in\n\nJune 1998, and to Peter Farley again in June 1998.\n\n            In the end, we believe that a determination of whether\n\nL.L. Bean should be liable for Juhl's conduct by reason of its\n\nfailure to take prompt and appropriate action to protect Crowley\n\nfrom Juhl raised a question that the jury might have resolved\neither way.       As already noted, however, our task is not to\n\ndetermine    whether     we   agree    with   the    jury's   verdict,    but   to\n\ndetermine whether a reasonable person could have arrived at its\nconclusion.      In light of the heavy burden placed on L.L. Bean to\n\noverturn the verdict based on sufficiency of the evidence grounds,\n\nwe conclude that Crowley presented sufficient evidence for a\n\nreasonable person to conclude that L.L. Bean failed to take prompt\n\nand appropriate action to put an end to Juhl's stalking of Crowley.\n\nTherefore, we will not upset the verdict based on L.L. Bean's\n\nargument that the evidence was insufficient to support it, and\n\nthus, we will not reverse the order of the district court denying\n\nL.L. Bean judgment as a matter of law on this basis.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -31-\n\f             2. Systemic Violation Claim\n\n             L.L. Bean next challenges the jury's finding that it\n\ncommitted a systemic violation.      It argues that Crowley failed to\npresent evidence that it maintained a \"discriminatory policy or\n\npractice.\"    It also contends that its alleged failure to recognize\n\nthat Juhl was stalking and sexually harassing Crowley is not\nsufficient to hold it liable for a systemic violation.       See Br. of\n\nAppellant at 40.\n\n             As already explained, Title VII required Crowley to file\n\nher charge of employment discrimination with the EEOC within 300\n\ndays of the alleged sexual harassment.          See 42 U.S.C. § 2000e-\n\n5(e)(1).     The continuing violation doctrine, however, \"creates an\n\nequitable exception to the 300-day limitation when the unlawful\nbehavior is deemed ongoing.\"       Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy, Div. of\n\nMelville Corp., 145 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir. 1998).       Traditionally we\n\nhave recognized that \"[c]ontinuing violations may be serial or\nsystemic\" and have distinguished between such violations.          Id.\n\n\"Systemic     violations   occur   where   an   employer   maintains   a\n\ndiscriminatory policy, responsible for multiple discriminatory acts\n\nthat fall outside the limitations period.\"         Rivera-Rodriguez v.\n\nFrito Lay Snacks Caribbean, 265 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir. 2001) (citing\n\nPilgrim v. Trustees of Tufts College, 118 F.3d 864, 869 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)).    On the other hand, there is a serial violation \"where the\n\nplaintiff experiences a number of discriminatory acts arising from\n\nthe same discriminatory animus.\" Id. at 22.          In this case, the\n\ndistrict court in recognition of the case law at the time of the\n\n                                   -32-\n\ftrial instructed the jury on the distinction between continuing and\n\nsystemic violations.          The jury then found that L.L. Bean had\n\ncommitted a systemic violation, but not a serial violation.\n            Crowley submits that the jury's verdict is supporatable\n\nbecause L.L. Bean's sexual harassment policy is fundamentally\n\nflawed insofar as it prohibits only sexually offensive behavior,\nnot nonsexual conduct motivated by gender bias.                     Crowley contends\n\nthat L.L. Bean's sexual harassment policy \"by definition fails to\n\naddress a wide range of illegal harassment that is directed at a\n\nvictim   because    of   gender      but    that   does       not   fall   within   the\n\nstereotypical      scenario     of   pin-ups,      breast-grabbing,         and     lewd\n\ncomments.\"     Br. of Appellee at 32.              Consequently, according to\n\nCrowley's    theory,     L.L.   Bean       committed      a    systemic    continuing\nviolation by maintaining a sexual harassment policy that led its\n\nmanagers and supervisors to identify Juhl's stalking and harassment\n\nof Crowley as non-sexual conduct that did not warrant investigation\nor remediation.\n\n             Clearly there is factual support for Crowley's argument\n\ninasmuch as L.L. Bean's sexual harassment policy focuses primarily\n\non   sex-related     conduct,        rather    than       on    nonsexual     --     yet\n\ninappropriate -- behavior motivated by gender. Indeed, L.L. Bean's\n\nemployee guide provides, in relevant part:\n\n             Generally speaking, sexual harassment is\n             defined as conduct or behavior that is\n             intimidating,   hostile,   offensive   and/or\n             interferes    with    an    employee's   work\n             performance. It includes conduct that creates\n             a hostile work environment.\n\n\n\n                                       -33-\n\f           Some examples of harassing behaviors include,\n           but are not limited to:\n\n                   •      Offensive sexual flirtations\n                   •      Verbal or physical abuse of a sexual\n                          nature\n                   •      Sexually suggestive gestures\n                          Advances or propositions\n                   •      The display of sexually suggestive\n                          objects,   pictures,    or   written\n                          materials\n                   •      Lewd nicknames\n                   •      Sexual practical jokes or horseplay\n\nApp. 111-12. Furthermore, a Human Resources manager testified that\n\nL.L. Bean's sexual harassment policy related to \"sexual acts\"\n\nrather than nonsexual conduct motivated by gender and that L.L.\nBean's policy did not prohibit an employee from stalking a person\nbecause of his or her gender.\n\n           Nevertheless, it does not appear that L.L. Bean itself\nmaintained a \"discriminatory policy or practice,\" Megwinoff v.\n\nBanco Bilbao Vizcaya, 233 F.3d 73, 77 (1st Cir. 2000), but simply\n\ndeveloped and implemented an anti-sexual harassment policy that\ndoes not    adequately    protect   its    employees    from   all   forms    of\nactionable sexual harassment.       L.L. Bean's failure, therefore, is\ndistinguishable    from    traditional      discriminatory      polices      and\npractices such as refusing to hire women or paying women less than\n\nmen.     Moreover, L.L. Bean's ineffective sexual discrimination\n\npolicy    does   not   discriminate       against   a   certain      class    of\n\nindividuals, such as women or minorities, but rather treats all\n\nemployees equally inasmuch as it provides every employee the same\n\ninadequate protection. Crowley has cited no case that supports her\n\ntheory that maintaining a substandard sexual harassment policy\n\n                                    -34-\n\fconstitutes a \"discriminatory policy or practice,\" and we were\n\nunable to find any caselaw supporting this novel theory.                      In the\n\ncircumstances,     we     are   satisfied    that    based     on    the    evidence\npresented at trial, the jury's conclusion that L.L. Bean committed\n\na systemic violation is problematic.\n\n          We need not resolve the point definitively, however, for\nwe are satisfied that the jury's possible error in concluding that\n\nthere was a systemic violation was harmless in the wake of the\n\nSupreme Court's decision in Morgan.           Under the rule of that case it\n\nis no longer necessary for a jury to determine whether a violation\n\nis systemic or serial when considering the timeliness of a hostile\n\nwork environment claim.           The Court in Morgan explained that a\n\n\"hostile work      environment      claim    is   comprised    of    a     series   of\nseparate acts that collectively constitute one 'unlawful employment\n\npractice.'\"   Morgan, --- U.S. at ---, 122 S. Ct. at 2074.                  Based on\n\nthat premise, the Court held that \"consideration of the entire\nscope of a hostile work environment claim, including behavior\n\nalleged outside the statutory time period, is permissible for the\npurposes of assessing liability, so long as any act contributing to\n\nthat hostile environment takes place within the statutory period.\"\n\nId. at ---, 122 S. Ct. at 2068.             See also id. at 2074 (\"Provided\n\nthat an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing\n\nperiod, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be\n\nconsidered    by    the     court    for    the     purposes    of       determining\n\nliability.\").\n\n\n\n                                      -35-\n\f          Inasmuch as under Morgan the entire period during which\n\na victim is subjected to a hostile work environment now constitutes\n\none   \"unlawful   employment   practice,\"   Morgan   supplants   our\njurisprudence on the continuing violation doctrine in hostile work\n\nenvironment claims, making it no longer necessary to distinguish\n\nbetween systemic and serial violations.     And because the hostile\nwork environment created by Juhl extended into the statutory period\n\n-- i.e., after February 24, 1998 -- Crowley satisfied the standard\n\nMorgan set forth and therefore was able to pursue her hostile work\n\nenvironment claim based partially on events that occurred outside\n\nthe limitations period.5\n\nB. New Trial\n\n          L.L. Bean argues that in the event we do not grant it\njudgment as a matter of law, in the alternative we should reverse\n\nthe district court's order denying it a new trial.      L.L. Bean's\n\nbases for a new trial include juror bias, erroneous evidentiary\nrulings, and improper jury instructions.     We reject L.L. Bean's\n\nrequest for a new trial, as none of its arguments has merit.\n\n\n\n\n  5\n   We note that the Supreme Court of New Jersey recently followed\nMorgan in construing the New Jersey Law Against Discrimination to\nresolve a statute of limitations question in a hostile\nenvironment continuing violation case without mentioning the\ndistinction between systemic and serial violations, thus\nimplicitly holding that the distinction does not matter when\nresolving the limitations question. See Shepherd v. Hunterdon\nDevelopmental Ctr., 803 A.2d 611, 623 (N.J. 2002). We make\nexplicit under Title VII what the New Jersey court held\nimplicitly under the similar New Jersey law.\n\n                                -36-\n\f          1. Juror Bias\n\n          L.L. Bean argues that it is entitled to a new trial\n\nbecause one of the jurors neglected to disclose her \"possible bias\"\nduring voir dire by    failing to reveal that she is a lawyer\n\naffiliated with the New England Research Institute who not only\n\nrepresented a female plaintiff in a sex discrimination suit in\nfederal court, but also investigates and researches legal topics\n\nrelating to women's health and quality of life issues.      Crowley\n\nresponds that L.L. Bean's charges of \"possible bias\" are purely\n\nspeculative and that it has not even tried to demonstrate that the\n\njuror's background would have affected the outcome of the trial.\n\n           To secure a new trial based on a juror's inaccurate\n\nanswers during voir dire, \"a party must first demonstrate that a\n\njuror failed to answer honestly a material question on voir dire,\n\nand then further show that a correct response would have provided\n\na valid basis for cause.\"   McDonough Power Equip., 464 U.S. at 556,\n104 S. Ct. at 850.        When seeking a new trial based on non-\n\ndisclosure of information by a juror during voir dire, however, a\n\nparty \"must do more than raise a speculative allegation that the\n\njuror's possible bias may have influenced the outcome of the\n\ntrial.\"   Dall, 970 F.2d at 969.\n\n          L.L. Bean sets forth the following facts and assertions\n\nto support its argument that the juror failed to disclose her\n\n\"possible bias.\"   Following the trial, the juror wrote a letter to\n\nthe trial judge asking permission to speak with Crowley's attorney,\n\nexplaining that she \"found the case to be most interesting, in\n\n                                -37-\n\fparticular because of my training as a psychologist and my interest\n\nas a research scientist.\"   After the judge shared the letter with\n\nthe parties, L.L. Bean discovered that the juror (1) worked for the\nNew England Research Institute; (2) investigated and researched\n\nwomen's issues, including topics on women's health as well as child\n\ncustody in battered-women cases; and (3) as a \"family lawyer,\"\nrepresented a woman in a federal sexual discrimination case.6\n\n          On the basis of the foregoing information, L.L. Bean\n\ncontends that the juror was dishonest when she failed to disclose\n\nher background after the judge asked the prospective jurors during\n\nvoir dire whether they knew \"of any reason whatever, whether I have\n\nasked you about it or not why you would have a concern about your\n\nability to serve as a fair and impartial juror if you are selected\nin this case.\"   Br. of Appellant at 42 (quoting Tr. of Voir Dire at\n\n24).   L.L. Bean insists that if the juror had disclosed her\n\n\"research interest in this case\" as well as her professional\nexperience as an attorney in a sex discrimination case, it would\n\nhave successfully challenged her for cause. Id. at 44.\n\n          We reject L.L. Bean's argument for several reasons.\n\nFirst, notwithstanding its assertions to the contrary, it has not\n\n\n  6\n   We are surprised that L.L. Bean was in the dark about the\njuror's background until she wrote her letter. In this regard,\nwe point out that in its brief it cites three Maine Supreme\nJudicial Court cases in which it indicated that she \"acted as a\nfamily lawyer [representing] women in contested family disputes.\"\nBr. of Appellant at 43. All three cases resulted in published\nopinions in which her name appeared as an attorney. Moreover,\nthe federal sex discrimination case produced a Westlaw opinion in\nwhich her name appears as an attorney.\n\n                                -38-\n\fdemonstrated that the juror was dishonest in response to the\n\ncourt's question.   Although L.L. Bean may believe that the juror's\n\nbackground and experience would make her biased, it does not follow\nthat she believed that she could not be a fair and impartial juror\n\nbecause of her experiences.\n\n           Second, L.L. Bean bases its charge of possible bias on\nits assumption that the juror is biased against all men and all\n\nemployers because she researched women's issues and served as an\n\nattorney some years ago in a sexual discrimination suit.     We agree\n\nwith the district court in its assessment that \"[t]he suggestion\n\nthat an interest in women's issues naturally correlates to a\n\ndislike for men and employers is\" unfounded.\n\n           Third, L.L. Bean only speculates as to whether the juror\nactually is biased, for it has not \"demonstrate[d] actual prejudice\n\nor bias,\" Dall, 970 F.2d at 969, but only has alleged \"possible\n\nbias.\"   Br. of Appellant at 41.    As we have stated previously, the\n\"'burden of proof must be sustained not as a matter of speculation,\n\nbut as a demonstrable reality.'\"      Dall, 970 F.2d at 969 (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Vargas, 606 F.2d 341, 344 (1st Cir. 1979)).\n\nTherefore, because L.L. Bean has not met the standard for obtaining\n\na new trial based on actual juror bias, we will affirm the district\n\ncourt's dismissal of its motion for new trial based on this ground.\n\n           2. Evidentiary Rulings\n\n           L.L. Bean contends that the district court made several\n\nerroneous evidentiary rulings that entitle it to a new trial.    The\n\ndistrict court, however, did not make an error of law or abuse its\n\n                               -39-\n\fdiscretion in any of these rulings, and therefore, we reject L.L.\n\nBean's request for new trial based on these grounds.\n\n                    a. Team Leader Hearsay\n\n            L.L. Bean asserts that the district court erred when it\n\nallowed Crowley to introduce hearsay testimony that her team\n\nleader, Peter Farley, jokingly referred to Juhl as Crowley's\n\"little stalker\" after she reported an incident of harassment by\n\nJuhl in April 1998.     L.L. Bean contends that the court improperly\n\nallowed the statement as an admission by a party-opponent under\n\nFed.   R.   Evid.   801(d)(2),   arguing   that   team   leaders   are   not\n\nauthorized to speak on its behalf, and therefore, \"their statements\n\ncannot be considered within the scope of their agency as an\n\nemployee of L.L. Bean.\"     Br. of Appellant at 46.\n            L.L. Bean's argument fails for two reasons.        First, the\n\ncourt did not allow Crowley to introduce the statement as an\n\nadmission by a party-opponent under Fed. R. Evid. 801(d)(2).\nRather, the court concluded that the statement did not constitute\n\nhearsay under Fed. R. Evid. 801(c) because it was not offered to\n\nprove the truth of the matter asserted.           In other words, Crowley\n\ndid not offer Farley's comments that Juhl is her \"little stalker\"\n\nto prove that Juhl is actually a stalker; she offered the statement\n\nto show that L.L. Bean management was aware of Juhl's behavior.\n\n            Second, even if the district court had admitted the\n\nstatement as an admission by a party-opponent under Fed. R. Evid.\n\n801(d)(2), we doubt that the court would have erred. Although L.L.\n\nBean now maintains that team leaders are not supervisors and are\n\n\n                                   -40-\n\fnot responsible for hiring, firing, or disciplining employees, L.L.\n\nBean admitted at trial that team leaders are, in fact, supervisors.\n\nFor instance, Human Resources manager Pat Bressette-Long testified\nthat team leaders were part of L.L. Bean's \"leadership.\" Moreover,\n\nL.L.    Bean's     job     descriptions       state     that    team    leaders    are\n\nresponsible      for     communicating     and    enforcing     company      policies,\nmaintaining employee records, making recommendations on hiring,\n\ndelivering       disciplinary       actions      to    employees,      and    handling\n\npersonnel issues.\n\n                       b. Inadmissible Lay Opinions\n\n           L.L. Bean next argues that the district court improperly\n\nallowed Crowley's witnesses to offer lay opinions by characterizing\n\nJuhl's conduct toward Crowley as \"stalking.\"                   L.L. Bean describes\nthese comments as a \"drive-by character assassination.\"                        Br. of\n\nAppellant at 49.\n\n           But Crowley's witnesses were not the only ones to use the\nterm \"stalking.\"          Human Resources manager Pat Bressette-Long and\n\nsupervisor David Simmons used the term \"stalked\" in their notes\n\nfrom their meeting with Crowley after Juhl broke into her home.\n\nMoreover, even L.L. Bean's attorneys used the term \"stalked\" at\n\ntrial, at one point asking Bressette-Long whether supervisor Tim\n\nMarong ever mentioned \"whether or not it was his conclusion that\n\nMs. Crowley was being stalked or that is what [Crowley] had said to\n\nhim.\"   And in response, Bressette-Long stated that Crowley had, in\n\nfact,    told     Marong     that    she    was       being    stalked.       In   the\n\ncircumstances, we reject L.L. Bean's argument on this point.\n\n\n                                         -41-\n\f                  c. Non-Workplace Conduct\n\n          L.L. Bean argues that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying its motion in limine to exclude evidence of\nJuhl's non-workplace conduct, such as Crowley's encounters with him\n\nat a bar and at the L.L. Bean Christmas party in 1996, his\n\nfollowing her home one night in 1996, and his breaking into her\nhome in February 1997.7   See Br. of Appellant at 51.           L.L. Bean\n\nfailed, however, to make a timely objection at trial to evidence\n\nrelating to Juhl's non-workplace conduct.       L.L. Bean only objected\n\nto \"time-barred\" evidence and actually stated to the district court\n\nthat the jury \"may take into consideration conduct that occurred\n\noff premises in determining whether the conduct at work was hostile\n\nenvironment.\"   Thus, L.L. Bean invited the ruling of which it now\ncomplains.\n\n          Assuming   arguendo   that    L.L.   Bean   had   preserved   its\n\nobjection, the district court would not have erred in allowing\nevidence relating to non-workplace conduct.       L.L. Bean opines that\n\nit cannot prevent and therefore should not be liable for an\n\nemployee's off-site behavior.     Consequently, L.L. Bean believes\n\nthat any evidence of non-workplace conduct and interactions is\n\nirrelevant and should be precluded.        Courts, however, do permit\n\n\n  7\n   L.L. Bean also submits that the district court erred when it\ndenied its motion to exclude evidence relating to Juhl's conduct\nprior to February 24, 1998. See Br. of Appellant at 51. As\ndiscussed repeatedly throughout this opinion, however, the jury\nwas permitted to consider this evidence and hold L.L. Bean liable\nfor maintaining a hostile work environment prior to February 24,\n1998, as long as the hostile work environment extended into the\nstatutory period.\n\n                                 -42-\n\fevidence of non-workplace conduct to help determine the severity\n\nand pervasiveness of the hostility in the workplace as well as to\n\nestablish that the conduct was motivated by gender.         For example,\nin O'Rourke, we affirmed a verdict in favor of a sexual harassment\n\nvictim who had offered evidence that she had received crank phone\n\ncalls at home.     See O'Rourke, 235 F.3d at 724.          In this case,\nJuhl's intimidating behavior and hostile interactions with Crowley\n\noutside of work help explain why she was so frightened of Juhl and\n\nwhy his constant presence around her at work created a hostile work\n\nenvironment.\n\n                  d. L.L Bean's Investigation\n\n           L.L. Bean contends that the district court improperly\n\nexcluded as hearsay certain documents relating to its investigation\nof a confrontation between Crowley and Juhl on June 23, 1998.           L.L.\n\nBean asserts that a report prepared by team leader Leo Davis\n\n\"paints a very different picture [of Juhl] than the caricature\npresented by Crowley,\" and the court's exclusion of the report of\n\nthe   investigation     \"significantly   hamstrung      [L.L.   Bean]    in\n\npresenting its defense.\"     Br. of Appellant at 53.\n\n           Aside from explaining how critical it believes that this\n\nreport was to its defense, L.L. Bean does not indicate the reasons\n\nwhy the district court's exclusion of the documents was improper or\n\nthe basis for admitting the documents.      L.L. Bean mentions in its\n\nbrief that Davis interviewed witnesses to the confrontation as well\n\nas Juhl and Crowley.    If that is the case, L.L. Bean would have to\n\novercome   a   double   hearsay   problem   for   the   evidence   to     be\n\n\n                                  -43-\n\fadmissible.       See United States v. Reilly, 33 F.3d 1396, 1410 (3d\n\nCir.    1994).      L.L.    Bean   does     not,    however,   attempt    to    find\n\nexceptions to address the multiple layers of hearsay.                    Moreover,\nL.L. Bean does not explain why the information in the report could\n\nnot have been elicited through direct testimony rather than through\n\nthe hearsay document. Overall, we are satisfied that L.L. Bean has\nnot demonstrated on appeal that the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion           in      disallowing              the      documents.\n\n               3. Jury Instructions\n\n               L.L. Bean's last rationale for requesting a new trial is\n\nto claim that the district court provided flawed jury instructions.\n\nSee Br. of Appellant at 55-60.               It argues that the court gave\n\nerroneous instructions on the elements of a systemic violation by\nfailing to make clear that Crowley had to prove that it maintained\n\na discriminatory policy or practice relating to hiring, training,\n\npromotions, firing, and compensation.\n               Even if these jury instructions were flawed legally as\n\nL.L. Bean contends, we conclude that the error was harmless in\n\nlight of the Supreme Court's decision in Morgan.                   As we already\n\nexplained above, Morgan eliminates the need for juries to determine\n\nwhether there was a systemic or serial violation in order to invoke\n\nthe continuing violations doctrine and thus to allow consideration\n\nof discriminatory acts that fell outside the limitations period.\n\nThe    Court    explained    in    Morgan    that    \"[p]rovided   that    an   act\n\ncontributing to the claim occurs within the filing period, the\n\nentire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by\n\n                                       -44-\n\fthe court for the purposes of determining liability.\"       Morgan, ---\n\nU.S. at ---, 122 S. Ct. at 2074.           Moreover, the asserted error\n\nwould not have contributed to the jury's finding that the violation\nwas ongoing.\n\n           Finally, L.L. Bean argues that the district court erred\n\nby refusing to instruct the jury that it must determine whether a\nhostile work environment existed based on Juhl's behavior at work,\n\nnot his non-workplace conduct.        See Br. of Appellant at 56.    As\n\nwith L.L. Bean's challenge to the court's evidentiary ruling\n\nallowing   evidence   of   Juhl's     non-workplace   conduct,   Crowley\n\nmaintains that L.L. Bean actually waived its objection by telling\n\nthe district court that the jury could \"take into consideration\n\nconduct that occurred off premises in determining whether the\nconduct at work was hostile environment.\"\n\n           Whether or not L.L. Bean waived its objection, it is\n\ninconceivable to us that the jury could have found L.L. Bean liable\nfor maintaining a hostile work environment by disregarding the\n\noverwhelming amount of evidence of Juhl's harassment on L.L. Bean's\n\npremises and instead basing its verdict on the comparatively few\n\nincidents involving Juhl's non-workplace conduct.          As such, we\n\nconclude that even if it would have been advisable to charge the\n\njury as L.L. Bean had requested, the        district court's refusal to\n\ndo so did not affect L.L. Bean's \"substantial rights\" and therefore\n\namounts to nothing more than harmless error under Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n61.   Cigna Ins. Co. v. Oy Saunatec, Ltd., 241 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).\n\n                                    -45-\n\f                         IV. CONCLUSION\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the order of the\n\ndistrict court denying L.L. Bean's motion for a judgment as a\nmatter of law or, in the alternative, a new trial and uphold the\n\njury verdict in favor of Eileen Crowley.\n\n\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -46-\n\f",

Bean's appeal from the district court's order entered November 8, 2001, denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the order of the district court and uphold the jury verdict in favor of plaintiff-appellee Eileen Crowley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly describe the facts at the outset, but discuss them in greater detail where applicable and essential to explain our determinations. Since 1992, Crowley has worked for L.L. Bean, a major catalog retailer based in Freeport, Maine, specializing in outdoor apparel and merchandise. In 1996, she began working as an \"order picker operator\" in L.L. Bean's warehouses and in this capacity drove 22,000-pound forklift-like machines called transtackers that collect merchandise for packing and shifting. Crowley claims that from 1996 until July 1998, her co-worker, Paul Juhl, stalked and harassed her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence at trial supported a conclusion that during the period involved, Juhl engaged in disturbing and sometimes peculiar behavior around Crowley, including grabbing her foot and massaging it against her will at an L.L. Bean pool party, continually following her at work even when they were not scheduled to work in the same warehouse, physically blocking her path and thereby forcing her to squeeze by him, giving her gifts designed to let her know that he was watching her, dancing in the aisles near her, waiting in the dark for her to come upon him, following her home, and even breaking into her house. Crowley reported most of these incidents to her team leaders or supervisors, but she claims that L.L. Bean did not take timely effective action to protect her from Juhl and therefore maintained a hostile work environment. L.L. Bean finally terminated Juhl's employment, but did so only after Crowley obtained a permanent court protection order against Juhl in July 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 21, 1998, Crowley filed a complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\") and the Maine Human Rights Commission, claiming that L.L. Bean had engaged in sex discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e <i>et seq.,</i> and the Maine Human Rights Act, Me. Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 4572 (West 2002). After the EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter and the Maine Human Rights Commission determined that L.L. Bean had not engaged in either sex discrimination or retaliation, Crowley filed her complaint in the district court on June 22, 2000, asserting that L.L. Bean had engaged in sex discrimination in violation of Title VII and the Maine Human Rights Act predicated on her assertion that she had been subjected to a hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury trial began on June 5, 2001, and concluded on June 11, 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> L.L. Bean moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 at the conclusion of Crowley's case-in-chief and renewed the motion after both parties rested. Before submitting the case to the jury, the court partially granted the motion but only as to Crowley's claim for punitive damages under the Maine Human Rights Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After one day of deliberations, the jury returned its verdict on June 13, 2001, finding that L.L. Bean had violated Title VII by sexually discriminating against Crowley through acts occurring on or after February 24, 1998. The February 24, 1998 date was critical because Crowley filed her EEOC claim 300 days after that date and she was required to file the charge within the 300-day period for it to be timely.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The jury also found that the unlawful discrimination was the result of a systemic violation, but not of a serial violation. The jury found, however, that L.L. Bean had not violated the Maine Human Rights Act by sexually discriminating against Crowley through acts occurring on or after June 22, 1998. The June 22, 1998 date was applicable because the Maine Human Rights Act has a two-year statute of limitations, and Crowley initiated this action on June 22, 2000. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 4613(2)(C) (West 2002). Finally, the jury awarded Crowley $215,000 in compensatory damages, but denied her any punitive damages.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 26, 2001, L.L. Bean filed a renewed motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 and 59.

Bean appeals from the district court's denial of its motion for judgment as a matter of law, our review of the district court's ruling is plenary, and we must apply the same standard that the district court applied in considering the motion. <i>See Mangla v. Brown Univ.,</i> 135 F.3d 80, 82 (1st Cir. 1998). Accordingly, we must \"view the evidence in the light most favorable to [Crowley], drawing all reasonable inferences in [her] favor.\" <i>McMillan v. Mass. Soc'y for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,</i> 140 F.3d 288, 299 (1st Cir.1998) (internal quotation marks omitted).

Mass. Mut. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 279 F.3d 36, 41-42 (1st Cir.2002) (internal quotation marks and brackets omitted); <i>see also White v. N.H. Dep't of Corr.,</i> 221 F.3d 254, 259 (1st Cir.2000) (\"Once a jury returns a verdict, a `heavy burden' is placed on one who challenges it.\"). Indeed, we should \"not set aside a jury verdict as a matter of law unless there was only one conclusion the jury could have reached,\" <i>McMillan,</i> 140 F.3d at 299, and that result was contrary to the verdict, <i>see White,</i> 221 F.3d at 259 (\"We may reverse only if a reasonable person could not have reached the conclusion of the jury.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean argues that in the event that we do not grant it judgment as a matter of law, we should grant it a new trial based on juror bias, erroneous evidentiary rulings, and improper jury instructions. L.L. Bean's motion for a new trial in the district court predicated on juror bias was \"committed to the discretion of [the] district court.\" <i>McDonough Power Equip., Inc. v. Greenwood,</i> 464 U.S. 548, 556, 104 S.Ct. 845, 850, 78 L.Ed.2d 663 (1984). Therefore, \"[i]n reviewing the district court's denial of appellant['s] request for a new trial, we ... consider only whether the district court abused its discretion.\" <i>Dall v.

Sposito,</i> 106 F.3d 1042, 1046 (1st Cir.1997) (\"The proper interpretation of the Federal Rules of Evidence is a question of law and is reviewed <i>de novo,</i> but the application of [a rule] ... is reviewed under an abuse-of-discretion standard.\") (citations omitted); <i>United States v.

Thus, we should reverse the district court's ruling \"if we determine that the judge `committed a meaningful error in judgment.'\" <i>Ruiz-Troche v. Pepsi Cola of P.R.

Bean challenges the jury verdict as to both Crowley's hostile work environment claim and her systemic sex discrimination claim. It contends that Crowley failed to present sufficient evidence to support either of the jury's findings. Crowley argues, however, that L.L. Bean has not met its demanding burden of demonstrating that no reasonable jury, presented with the evidence adduced at trial, could have found L.L. Bean liable for maintaining a hostile work environment and committing a systemic violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Hostile Work Environment Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 provides, in relevant part, that \"[i]t shall be an unlawful employment practice for an employer ... to discriminate against any individual with respect to his compensation, terms, conditions, or privileges of employment, because of such individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-2(a)(1). The Supreme Court has stated that \"`[t]he phrase \"terms, conditions, or privileges of employment\" evinces a congressional intent to strike at the entire spectrum of disparate treatment of men and women in employment,' which includes requiring people to work in a discriminatorily hostile or abusive environment.\" <i>Harris v. Forklift Sys.,</i> 510 U.S. 17, 21, 114 S.Ct. 367, 370, 126 L.Ed.2d 295 (1993) (some internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Meritor Sav. Bank, FSB v.

City of Providence,</i> 235 F.3d 713, 728 (1st Cir.2001). L.L. Bean asserts that Crowley presented insufficient evidence at trial to satisfy three elements of her hostile work environment claim &#8212; namely, that Crowley perceived Juhl's behavior as \"subjectively abusive,\" that Juhl's conduct was \"severe and pervasive,\" and that L.L. Bean knew or should have known about Juhl's alleged harassment, but failed to take prompt or appropriate action to remedy the situation. Br. of Appellant at 18-31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before addressing the specifics of each claim, however, it is important to point out that L.L. Bean predicates its argument on two critical suppositions: (1) Title VII's administrative filing requirements precluded the jury from considering allegations of harassment that occurred before February 24, 1998; and (2) the jury's verdict on the state law claim established that Crowley was not harassed after June 22, 1998. Thus, L.L. Bean effectively seeks to cabin Crowley's claim to the end that it is based only on events occurring during a four-month period. L.L. Bean then argues that the \"handful of incidents\" that occurred during that four-month period between February 24, 1998, and June 22, 1998, are insufficient to support the jury's verdict. Br. of Appellant at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>National Railroad Passenger Corp. v. Morgan,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 122 S.Ct. 2061, 153 L.Ed.2d 106 (2002), severely undermines L.L. Bean's argument. In <i>Morgan,</i> the Court held that \"consideration of the entire scope of a hostile work environment claim, including behavior alleged outside the statutory time period, is permissible for the purposes of assessing liability, so long as any act contributing to that hostile environment takes place within the statutory time period.\" <i>Id.</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2068. The Court explained that a \"hostile work environment claim is comprised of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one `unlawful employment practice.'\" <i>Id.</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2074. Thus, \"[p]rovided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by the court for the purposes of determining liability.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, in the wake of <i>Morgan,</i> the jury not only could consider Juhl's conduct prior to February 24, 1998, as \"relevant background evidence,\" <i>United Air Lines, Inc. v. Evans,</i> 431 U.S. 553, 558, 97 S.Ct. 1885, 1889, 52 L.Ed.2d 571 (1977), but also could hold L.L. Bean liable for the alleged acts of harassment that fell outside the 300-day period for filing an EEOC charge of sexual discrimination provided that it found that there was an act contributing to the hostile environment within the 300-day filing period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Notwithstanding the thrust of L.L. Bean's argument that Crowley's allegations of harassment included only \"a few brief encounters\" between her and Juhl that were \"scarcely threatening,\" Br. of Appellant at 24, 31, Crowley offered evidence at trial establishing that Juhl's harassment began in the fall of 1996 and continued into July 1998, and thus L.L. Bean's argument is flawed. Consequently, we must review all such evidence offered at trial when determining whether the jury verdict is supported by the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have indicated, L.L. Bean also asserts that we must disregard any evidence of sexual harassment on or after June 22, 1998, because the jury found that it had not violated the Maine Human Rights Act by sexually discriminating against her by acts occurring on or after that date. Although this evidence appears to be of limited significance inasmuch as Crowley alleges only a few incidents of alleged harassment by Juhl after June 22, 1998, L.L. Bean is wrong on this point, too. In basing its argument on the portion of the jury's verdict that L.L. Bean had not sexually discriminated against Crowley on or after June 22, 1998, L.L. Bean assumes that the jury concluded that the hostile work environment ceased to exist on June 22, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the jury's determination that L.L. Bean was not liable for maintaining a hostile work environment under the state statute based solely on incidents that occurred on or after June 22 does not mean that the jury was &#8212; and, therefore, this court is &#8212; precluded from considering any evidence relating to Juhl's post-June 22 conduct when determining L.L. Bean's liability under Title VII. As Crowley argues in her brief, \"[t]he fact that the number of incidents from June 23 forward do not constitute a violation of state law by themselves has no logical connection to whether those incidents can be considered, together with earlier incidents, under federal law.\" Br. of Appellee at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, L.L. Bean draws too many conclusions from the jury's verdict. For instance, the jury may have found for L.L. Bean on the state law claim because it concluded that Crowley had not satisfied the employer liability element of the hostile work environment claim (perhaps because it decided that L.L. Bean finally took appropriate remedial measures to end the hostile work environment on or after June 22, 1998), not because the jury believed that Crowley failed to prove that Juhl's conduct on or after June 22, 1998, was \"severe or pervasive.\" In other words, the jury may have believed that Crowley was subject to a hostile work environment on or after June 22, 1998, but that L.L. Bean nevertheless should not be held liable for Juhl's conduct on or after that date. Because we have no way of knowing the jury's reason for rendering its verdict on the state law claim, L.L. Bean's argument that we cannot consider evidence relating to events on or after June 22, 1998, must fail. Therefore, we will consider all of the evidence offered at trial regarding Juhl's harassment from the fall of 1996 through July of 1998 in determining whether the evidence supports the jury's verdict that L.L. Bean maintained a hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">a. <i>Subjectively Abusive</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean first argues that the jury's verdict should be overturned because Crowley did not offer any evidence demonstrating that Juhl's conduct was \"subjectively abusive.\" It asserts that \"[s]ince Crowley did not believe that Juhl was sexually harassing her until June 23, 1998, ... Crowley did not subjectively believe that she was being subjected to a hostile work environment during the statutory period.\" Br. of Appellant at 19 (citations to the record omitted). L.L. Bean seizes on the June 23, 1998 date because Crowley testified that until that date, she thought the team leaders adequately were taking care of the Juhl situation and therefore she had no complaints regarding what L.L. Bean was doing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument, as L.L. Bean misapprehends what Crowley was required to \"subjectively perceive.\" As Crowley points out in her brief, although the victim must subjectively perceive the harasser's conduct to be \"hostile or abusive,\" the victim need not subjectively believe that the conduct met the legal definition of unlawful sexual harassment. <i>See</i> Br. of Appellee at 14. At trial, Crowley testified that she was frightened and feared for her safety because Juhl was stalking her. <i>See Tr.</i> 94, 109 (she was \"scared\"); 93 (she \"was scared to death\"); 123, 127, 131 (she was \"shaking\"); 127 (she \"was breaking down\"); 130 (she \"felt real shaky inside\"); 146 (she was \"[r]eally upset\"); 135 (she \"felt like [she] was going to get hurt\"). Furthermore, Crowley offered into evidence a copy of L.L. Bean's written warning to Juhl, in which it informed Juhl that he has \"created a hostile environment in which [Crowley] felt physically threatened.\" App. 99.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, although Crowley may not have realized until June 1998 that Juhl's conduct actually constituted sexual harassment, she did present evidence establishing that she earlier considered Juhl's behavior threatening and hostile. Consequently, contrary to L.L. Bean's assertion, Crowley presented sufficient evidence for a rational jury to find that she perceived Juhl's conduct to be \"hostile or abusive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">b. <i>Severe or Pervasive</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean next argues that Crowley's \"eight encounters\" with Juhl during the four-month period were not objectively \"severe and pervasive\" enough to create a hostile work environment, insisting that Crowley's allegations \"`are so trivial, so isolated, and so far from the paradigmatic case of sexual harassment' that judgment as a matter of law is `clearly appropriate.'\" Br. of Appellant at 20-21 (quoting <i>Hartsell v. Duplex Prod., Inc.,</i> 123 F.3d 766, 773 (4th Cir.1997)). L.L. Bean contends that Crowley's hostile work environment claim is supported merely by</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">evidence that Juhl gave her a book, came to the wrong building where she was working on three occasions, operated his machine in her vicinity on occasion (and told her once `it will cost you' when she asked him to move), and came out of a tunnel dancing on one occasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reply Br. of Appellant at 9. As we explained above, <i>Morgan</i> fatally undermines this argument, for Crowley's allegations do not merely include eight incidents, but involve alleged acts of harassment and stalking that spanned nearly one and a half years. Accordingly, we will review evidence relating to all of Crowley's allegations &#8212; not just those of acts that occurred between February 24, 1998, and June 22, 1998 &#8212; to determine whether Juhl's conduct was sufficiently \"severe or pervasive\" to constitute actionable harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowley presented the following evidence to support her hostile work environment claim. In 1996, at an L.L. Bean pool party, Juhl grabbed her foot and massaged it against her will. He told her that she was the \"perfect woman\" and that she had \"perfect women's feet.\" Juhl also gave Crowley gifts intended to let her know that he was watching her both at and outside of work. He even followed her home one evening by turning off his headlights and pursuing her car in the dark. At an L.L. Bean party in December 1996, he again stated that Crowley was the perfect woman and pinpointed the exact location of her house on a map, letting her know that he knew exactly where she lived. Crowley reported these incidents to her team leader, David Baker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1997, Juhl followed Crowley at work and bothered her, sometimes lurking in the dark outside the women's bathroom while he waited for her to emerge. He often parked next to her car in the parking lot and followed her to her car when she was leaving work. He also used L.L. Bean's hand-held computer units to track Crowley's movement within the warehouse. Juhl frequently blocked her in the aisles and forced her to squeeze by him. Crowley reported all of these incidents to her supervisor, Tim Marong, who remarked that Juhl was stalking her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 16, 1997, Juhl broke into Crowley's home while she was there. He tried to get her to touch his clothing, and he grabbed her wrists in an attempt to bring her upstairs with him. He not only told her that he wanted to date her, but admitted that he had been at her house previously and described what outfits she had been wearing on those occasions. Crowley explained that she had a boyfriend, but Juhl responded, \"but he's never here.\" After he finally left, Crowley saw him outside peering in different windows of her house. She hid in the bathroom until he left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As she had done previously, Crowley reported this incident to her supervisors. She told her team leaders, her supervisor Tim Marong, and L.L. Bean's Human Resources personnel that she believed she was being stalked. Indeed, Marong testified that he thought that Juhl's conduct could have constituted sexual harassment. Marong contacted Pat Bressette-Long, a Human Resources supervisor, who met with Crowley several weeks later. Crowley informed Bressette-Long not only about Juhl's uninvited entry into her home, but also about his intimidating behavior at work. When Crowley asked whether she should notify the plant manager, Frank Johnson, about Juhl's conduct, Bressette-Long advised her not to break the chain of command, but to continue reporting her complaints to her immediate supervisor. One month after Crowley met with Bressette-Long, Juhl was reassigned to a separate work area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From March 1997 until the summer of 1997, Juhl continued to work near Crowley, even when he was scheduled to work elsewhere. He also continued his familiar conduct of blocking her in the aisles with his transtacker and dancing near her. She reported Juhl's disturbing and sometimes bizarre behavior to her team leader and Human Resources, which assured her that Juhl would be scheduled to work in a different warehouse. Despite these assurances, however, in May 1997, L.L. Bean permitted Juhl to volunteer to work shifts in her warehouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the summer of 1997, Juhl's conduct did not change, as he kept trying to be near Crowley. He not only continued to corner her and make her ask him to move out of the way, but also began hiding in dark areas of the warehouse where Crowley would come upon him. Crowley notified her team leader, Leo Davis, about Juhl's conduct, but he did nothing, even though he promised to investigate the matter. Meanwhile, Juhl's behavior continued unabated. In July 1997, he appeared unexpectedly in her work area 15 or more times, lingered around the time clock at the end of Crowley's shift, and stood close to her on numerous occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the fall and early winter of 1997, Crowley saw Juhl so often in her work area that she assumed that they were working the same shift. She later learned that Juhl actually was working the wrong shift with management's knowledge. Co-workers also noticed Juhl's conduct, prompting one witness to remark, \"Wherever she was, he was.\" In fact, one L.L. Bean witness testified that he believed Juhl was sexually attracted to Crowley, explaining that \"it was kind of obvious the way he handled himself.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1998, Crowley briefly was assigned to work an 8:00 a.m.-4:30 p.m. shift and therefore maintained little contact with Juhl. This respite was short-lived, however, for L.L. Bean soon placed her back on the third shift with Juhl. She notified her supervisor, Bob Anderson, that she was scared and asked for a parking space closer to the building so that she would not be alone with Juhl. Anderson stated that he was aware of her problems with Juhl, but that he had to put her back on Juhl's shift for business reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1998, Juhl's contact with Crowley intensified. He gave her a book on holistic cancer therapy after her friend's mother died of cancer. Crowley maintains that Juhl could have known about the death of her friend's mother only by following Crowley. Crowley told her team leaders about the incident and reported that he had grabbed her hands when he tried to give her the book. Juhl also drove his transtacker up and down the aisle, shadowing her movements in the adjacent aisle, and used his transtacker to block her in aisles. Crowley reported these incidents to her team leaders, David Baker and Steve McCourt, who assured her that L.L. Bean was taking her concerns seriously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1998, L.L. Bean consolidated the first and third shifts of its distributions operation and consequently transferred Juhl to the morning shift. Despite being assigned to a different building, Juhl showed up at Crowley's building on March 30 and 31, and April 1, 1998. As one co-worker testified, Juhl \"would constantly show up in the wrong building\" during March and April 1998, and \"was constantly following her all the time, he never stopped.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1998, Juhl continued showing up in Crowley's work area, following her, and physically obstructing her from doing her work. One time, he danced in the aisle in front of her. Another time, he prevented her from passing, and when she asked him to let her by, he responded that it would \"cost her.\" When Crowley reported these incidents to her new team leader, Peter Farley, he joked about Juhl's conduct and referred to him as her \"little stalker.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From April until June 1998, Crowley's interaction with Juhl was limited, as the two worked on different shifts. Juhl nevertheless loitered around the time clock and the warehouse entrance, waiting for Crowley to come and go. On June 22, 1998, Juhl was returned to Crowley's shift. Shortly thereafter, Juhl lapsed back into his familiar pattern of behavior, blocking her in the aisles, making her beg him to move, and forcing her to squeeze by him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 23, 1998, a team leader, Leo Davis, witnessed Juhl blocking Crowley, but did nothing. Instead, Davis laughed with Juhl in front of Crowley and then looked at her, smiled, and left. Furthermore, Ken Libby, a fellow employee, warned supervisor Anderson that Crowley would end up dead if someone did not do something to stop Juhl. In addition, Bennett Schlaack, a trainer, advised three team leaders &#8212; John Andretta, Steve McCourt, and David Baker &#8212; that Juhl was shadowing Crowley and that he was concerned for her safety. L.L. Bean, however, took no action. Frustrated with L.L. Bean's ineffectiveness in protecting her from Juhl, Crowley went to the police a few days after Davis saw Juhl block Crowley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, Leo Davis was assigned to investigate a confrontation between Crowley and Juhl that occurred on the same day that Davis witnessed Juhl blocking Crowley. Aside from Davis, two other employees witnessed the incident and reported the matter to management. Crowley explained to Davis that Juhl's conduct was longstanding, but Davis indicated to her that L.L. Bean \"had to protect Paul's rights.\" During the course of Davis's investigation, Crowley was restricted to the dock area, while Juhl enjoyed full access to the warehouse. Notwithstanding Crowley's complaints, management made no effort to keep Juhl away from Crowley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 30, 1998, L.L. Bean issued a written warning to Juhl, stating that he had \"created a hostile work environment in which [Crowley] felt physically threatened\" and that his \"threatening, intimidating behavior will not be tolerated.\" The warning indicated that Juhl \"must take action to avoid further contact with Eileen Crowley.\" The Human Resources official who issued the warning, Rebecca Batchelder, testified that she did not know that L.L. Bean already had issued a directive in the spring of 1997 requiring that Juhl and Crowley work in separate buildings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Davis's investigation when Crowley and Juhl were separated at work and even after Juhl received his written warning instructing him to stay away from Crowley, Juhl continued following Crowley around at work. Sometime after June 24, 1998, Crowley again complained to her team leader, Peter Farley, that Juhl was violating the standing order that he and Crowley be kept separated, but Farley took no action other than to suggest that Crowley have her boyfriend give Juhl a \"blanket party.\" On July 7, 1998, after Farley again allowed Juhl and Crowley to work in the same area, Crowley returned to the police department and obtained a temporary protection order against Juhl. The police served Juhl with the order at work on the same day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, L.L. Bean placed Juhl on paid leave pending the court hearing on Crowley's request for a protection order. On July 17, 1998, Crowley obtained a permanent court protection order against Juhl. On July 24, 1998, L.L. Bean terminated Juhl's employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is quite evident, Crowley presented evidence relating to more than just eight innocuous encounters between her and Juhl. In fact, she provided ample evidence to establish that Juhl engaged in a longstanding pattern of hostile and intimidating behavior towards her that spanned over one and a half years. To prevail on this appeal, L.L. Bean must demonstrate that no reasonable person could have reached the conclusion of the jury, even after viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. Based on the evidence adduced at trial, it cannot be said that a reasonable person could not have concluded that Juhl's conduct towards Crowley was \"severe or pervasive.\" Indeed, as the EEOC wrote in its amicus brief, \"by focusing only on the specific incidents which occurred after February 24, Bean fails to capture the residual and cumulative effect that Juhl's campaign of harassment had on Crowley's working conditions even on days when she did not encounter him.\" Amicus Br. of EEOC at 21. Consequently, Crowley presented sufficient evidence at trial to satisfy this element of her hostile work environment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">c. <i>Employer Liability</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean finally argues with respect to the hostile work environment claim that Crowley failed to offer sufficient evidence to establish employer liability. Although this appears to be L.L. Bean's best argument to the extent that it challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, it nevertheless is unable to meet the onerous burden of proving that a reasonable person could not have concluded that, after it learned of Juhl's behavior, it failed to take appropriate steps to stop Juhl's harassment and stalking of Crowley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff must satisfy different standards for establishing employer liability in a hostile work environment case depending on whether the harasser is a supervisor or co-employee of the victim. In this case, it is beyond dispute that Juhl and Crowley were co-employees. To establish employer liability for a non-supervisory co-employee, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the employer \"`knew or should have known of the charged sexual harassment and failed to implement prompt and appropriate action.'\" <i>White,</i> 221 F.3d at 261 (quoting <i>Blankenship v. Parke Care Ctrs., Inc.,</i> 123 F.3d 868, 872 (6th Cir.1997)). L.L. Bean maintains that Crowley did not present sufficient evidence to satisfy either prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">i. <i>Whether L.L. Bean Knew or Should Have Known</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence offered at trial, if viewed in the light most favorable to Crowley, clearly supports a jury finding that L.L. Bean knew or should have known that Juhl was harassing and stalking Crowley. L.L. Bean bases its misguided argument to the contrary on its restricted temporal view of the evidence, but as we explained above, the statute of limitations did not preclude the jury &#8212; and therefore does not preclude us &#8212; from considering evidence relating to harassment before February 24, 1998, and the jury verdict on the state law claim does not preclude us from considering evidence relating to harassment on or after June 22, 1998. Therefore, we must consider all of the evidence, from 1996 until July 1998, to determine whether it was sufficient to support a jury finding that L.L. Bean knew about Juhl's conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowley presented ample evidence that she reported Juhl's behavior to her team leaders, supervisors, and Human Resources. Crowley began notifying her supervisors of Juhl's disturbing behavior in 1996, when she informed her team leader, David Baker, that Juhl was harassing and following her both on and off L.L. Bean's premises. In January 1997, she told her team leader, John Andretta, and her supervisor, Tim Marong, that Juhl was bothering her at work, tracking her movements with the hand-held computers, waiting for her in the dark outside the women's bathroom, blocking her in the aisles with his transtacker, and forcing her to squeeze by him. After Juhl broke into her home in February 1997, she reported the incident to team leaders Andretta and Steve McCourt, supervisor Marong, and Human Resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring of 1997, Crowley advised her new team leader, Baker, that Juhl was continuing to show up in her building and block her in the aisles. In April and May 1997, after Crowley twice told Human Resources about Juhl's stalking behavior, Human Resources assured her Juhl would be scheduled for work in a different warehouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1997, Crowley notified her team leader, Leo Davis, that Juhl always was trying to be near her and that he hid in the dark, waiting for her to come upon him. In September 1997, she told her team leader, Keith Menard, that Juhl was showing up repeatedly in her work area, even though he was working a different shift.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1998, after being put back on the first shift with Juhl, Crowley informed her supervisor, Bob Anderson, that she was scared of Juhl and had concerns about working on the same shift with him. In February 1998, Crowley reported to her team leaders, Baker and McCourt, that Juhl was shadowing her movements in his transtacker. During L.L. Bean's shift consolidation in March 1998, Crowley complained to Baker that Juhl had come to the wrong building three days in a row.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1998, Crowley told her new team leader, Peter Farley, that Juhl was physically blocking her from doing her work, but Farley laughed about Juhl's behavior and referred to him as her \"little stalker.\" In late June 1998, Crowley again complained to Farley that Juhl was violating the standing directive that he and Crowley be kept separated at work, but Farley did nothing to remedy the situation. In July 1998, after Juhl was issued a written warning requiring him to stay away from Crowley but before L.L. Bean placed him on unpaid leave, Farley allowed Juhl to work in Crowley's vicinity despite her previous complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to Crowley's repeated complaints to her team leaders and supervisors about Juhl's conduct, Crowley's co-workers also reported Juhl's behavior and expressed their concerns for her safety. <i>See, e.g., Sims v. Health Midwest Physician Servs. Corp.,</i> 196 F.3d 915, 921 (8th Cir.1999) (\"Notification of sexual harassment to an employer need not come solely from the victim of the harassment for knowledge to be imputed to the employer.\"). For instance, Ken Libby, a fellow employee, warned supervisor Anderson that Crowley would end up dead if someone did not do something to stop Juhl. Another fellow employee, Alan Coffin, alerted Anderson to Juhl's odd practice of dancing near Crowley. In addition, Bennett Schlaack, a trainer, advised three team leaders &#8212; Andretta, McCourt, and Baker &#8212; that Juhl was shadowing Crowley and that he was concerned for her safety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Crowley presented evidence that L.L. Bean managers, team leaders, and supervisors were aware of Juhl's conduct and that at times they even characterized it as harassment. For example, after Juhl broke into Crowley's home in February 1997, Crowley spoke with both her supervisor, Tim Marong, and a Human Resources supervisor, Pat Bressette-Long. Marong's memo notes that Crowley \"felt that Paul was stalking her,\" and Bressette-Long's hand-written notes state that \"Eileen Crowley feels like she is being stalked.\" The Security Department investigated a complaint Crowley advanced in May 1997 and described her grievance as a \"sexual harassment complaint\" in a document distributed to \"management\" &#8212; specifically, to manager Tim Parker. After Crowley asked her supervisor, Bob Anderson, to put her back on the first shift in January 1998 because she was concerned about Juhl, Anderson sent an email to other management personnel stating that everyone was fully aware of the situation between Crowley and Juhl. Crowley's team leader, John Andretta, testified at trial that \"it was obvious everybody knew of the Juhl/Eileen situation and how he was following her around, always being where she was.\" Finally, the written warning to Juhl on June 30, 1998, indicated that he had \"created a hostile work environment in which [Crowley] felt physically threatened\" and that his \"threatening, intimidating behavior will not be tolerated.\" At bottom, L.L. Bean's contention that Crowley did not properly notify management of her complaints because she \"bypass[ed] the reporting requirements under L.L. Bean's harassment policies,\" Br. of Appellant at 28, is without merit, for Crowley and her co-workers repeatedly alerted team leaders and supervisors about Juhl's conduct. L.L. Bean representatives admitted that the proper procedure for an employee to report a claim of harassment was to notify his or her team leader. Once a team leader received a complaint from an employee, it was the team leader's duty to report the complaint up the chain of command to his or her supervisor. Therefore, by maintaining a policy that permitted workers to report sexual harassment claims to team leaders, L.L. Bean provided these team leaders with actual authority to receive notice of sexual harassment complaints on behalf of the company, and their knowledge was imputed to it. <i>See, e.g., Sims,</i> 196 F.3d at 920 (stating that \"employer liability could attach if information of the harassment had come to the attention of someone who is reasonably believed to have a duty to pass on the information\"). As such, Crowley provided sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that L.L. Bean knew or should have known about Juhl's harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">ii. <i>Whether L.L. Bean Took Prompt and Appropriate Action</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean contends that the evidence offered at trial did not support a jury finding that it failed to take prompt and appropriate remedial action after receiving Crowley's complaints. In fact, it asserts that \"[w]hen Crowley conveyed her concerns previously to a supervisor or a human resources representative, L.L. Bean took immediate action.\" Br. of Appellant at 28. L.L. Bean argues:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, Crowley's argument boils down to a claim that L.L. Bean is strictly liable for any encounter between Crowley and Juhl because its prior warnings to Juhl to stay away from Crowley and not to bother her, and its prior actions in separating them, were not 100 percent effective in preventing Crowley and Juhl from ever crossing paths again. Suffice it to say, this is not the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, reasonable jurors might have agreed with L.L. Bean's argument that, although its remedial actions were not 100% effective, it did take prompt and appropriate action and therefore should not be liable for Juhl's unlawful conduct. There is some force to its argument that inasmuch as Crowley actually conceded in her testimony that she was pleased with L.L. Bean's responses to her complaints prior to June 23, 1998,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> it should escape liability. <i>See</i> Br. of Appellant at 28. Having said that, however, we do not review the jury's findings <i>de novo,</i> but instead must uphold the jury verdict unless no reasonable person could have reached its conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury obviously concluded that L.L. Bean did not take prompt and appropriate action to protect Crowley from Juhl, and this conclusion was not unreasonable. Aside from suspending and eventually terminating Juhl after Crowley obtained a permanent court protection order against him, the only significant remedial action L.L. Bean ever took to protect Crowley from Juhl was to schedule Crowley and Juhl in different buildings or on different shifts. For instance, after Juhl broke into Crowley's home in February 1997, Human Resources ordered that Juhl and Crowley be kept separated. Then, after disregarding numerous complaints by Crowley over the ensuing year and a half, L.L. Bean finally issued a written warning to Juhl in June 1998 for \"creat[ing] a hostile work environment in which [Crowley] felt physically threatened\" and ordered him to \"take action to avoid further contact with Eileen Crowley.\" In short, L.L. Bean adopted the same remedial action in June 1998 as it had in February 1997, even though (1) the earlier action had proven ineffective, (2) Crowley repeatedly had complained to her team leaders and supervisors that Juhl wantonly ignored the directive, (3) supervisors often failed to abide by the policy and permitted Juhl and Crowley to work together, and (4) the cumulative effect of Juhl's conduct over the year-and-a-half period only had exacerbated the hostile work environment in which Crowley was forced to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, although L.L. Bean may have made a good faith effort to implement an effective remedial measure in February 1997, it could not turn a blind eye towards the measure's ineffectiveness over the following 18 months, only to reinstitute the same inadequate remedial measure in response to its finding that Juhl had subjected Crowley to a hostile work environment. Thus, based on L.L. Bean's pattern of indifference towards Crowley's complaints about Juhl between February 1997 and June 1998, it cannot be said that a reasonable jury could not find that L.L. Bean failed to take prompt and appropriate action to protect Crowley from Juhl.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, notwithstanding L.L. Bean's assertion that it \"took immediate action\" in response to each of Crowley's complaints, Crowley offered ample testimony supporting her position that L.L. Bean ignored many complaints she and her co-workers submitted concerning Juhl's behavior. Rather than reiterate each instance in which L.L. Bean failed to respond to Crowley's complaints, we simply will direct the parties to our summary of the evidence above. <i>See supra</i> Part III.A.1.b. There, one will see that L.L. Bean did not respond to Crowley's complaints to Human Resources in May 1997, to Leo Davis in the summer of 1997, to Bob Anderson in January 1998, to David Baker and Steve McCourt in February 1998, to Peter Farley in April 1998, to Leo Davis again in June 1998, and to Peter Farley again in June 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we believe that a determination of whether L.L. Bean should be liable for Juhl's conduct by reason of its failure to take prompt and appropriate action to protect Crowley from Juhl raised a question that the jury might have resolved either way. As already noted, however, our task is not to determine whether we agree with the jury's verdict, but to determine whether a reasonable person could have arrived at its conclusion. In light of the heavy burden placed on L.L. Bean to overturn the verdict based on sufficiency of the evidence grounds, we conclude that Crowley presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable person to conclude that L.L. Bean failed to take prompt and appropriate action to put an end to Juhl's stalking of Crowley. Therefore, we will not upset the verdict based on L.L. Bean's argument that the evidence was insufficient to support it, and thus, we will not reverse the order of the district court denying L.L. Bean judgment as a matter of law on this basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Systemic Violation Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean next challenges the jury's finding that it committed a systemic violation. It argues that Crowley failed to present evidence that it maintained a \"discriminatory policy or practice.\" It also contends that its alleged failure to recognize that Juhl was stalking and sexually harassing Crowley is not sufficient to hold it liable for a systemic violation. <i>See</i> Br. of Appellant at 40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already explained, Title VII required Crowley to file her charge of employment discrimination with the EEOC within 300 days of the alleged sexual harassment. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1). The continuing violation doctrine, however, \"creates an equitable exception to the 300-day limitation when the unlawful behavior is deemed ongoing.\" <i>Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy, Div. of Melville Corp.,</i> 145 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir.1998). Traditionally we have recognized that \"[c]ontinuing violations may be serial or systemic\" and have distinguished between such violations. <i>Id.</i> \"Systemic violations occur where an employer maintains a discriminatory policy, responsible for multiple discriminatory acts that fall outside the limitations period.\" <i>Rivera-Rodriguez v. Frito Lay Snacks Caribbean,</i> 265 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir.2001) (citing <i>Pilgrim v. Trustees of Tufts College,</i> 118 F.3d 864, 869 (1st Cir.1997)). On the other hand, there is a serial violation \"where the plaintiff experiences a number of discriminatory acts arising from the same discriminatory animus.\" <i>Id.</i> at 22. In this case, the district court in recognition of the case law at the time of the trial instructed the jury on the distinction between continuing and systemic violations. The jury then found that L.L. Bean had committed a systemic violation, but not a serial violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowley submits that the jury's verdict is supportable because L.L. Bean's sexual harassment policy is fundamentally flawed insofar as it prohibits only sexually offensive behavior, not nonsexual conduct motivated by gender bias. Crowley contends that L.L. Bean's sexual harassment policy \"by definition fails to address a wide range of illegal harassment that is directed at a victim because of gender but that does not fall within the stereotypical scenario of pin-ups, breast-grabbing, and lewd comments.\" Br. of Appellee at 32. Consequently, according to Crowley's theory, L.L. Bean committed a systemic continuing violation by maintaining a sexual harassment policy that led its managers and supervisors to identify Juhl's stalking and harassment of Crowley as non-sexual conduct that did not warrant investigation or remediation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clearly there is factual support for Crowley's argument inasmuch as L.L. Bean's sexual harassment policy focuses primarily on sex-related conduct, rather than on nonsexual &#8212; yet inappropriate &#8212; behavior motivated by gender. Indeed, L.L. Bean's employee guide provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally speaking, sexual harassment is defined as conduct or behavior that is intimidating, hostile, offensive and/or interferes with an employee's work performance. It includes conduct that creates a hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some examples of harassing behaviors include, but are not limited to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Offensive sexual flirtations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Verbal or physical abuse of a sexual nature</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Sexually suggestive gestures Advances or propositions</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; The display of sexually suggestive objects, pictures, or written materials</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Lewd nicknames</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Sexual practical jokes or horseplay</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">App. 111-12. Furthermore, a Human Resources manager testified that L.L. Bean's sexual harassment policy related to \"sexual acts\" rather than nonsexual conduct motivated by gender and that L.L. Bean's policy did not prohibit an employee from stalking a person because of his or her gender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, it does not appear that L.L. Bean itself maintained a \"discriminatory policy or practice,\" <i>Megwinoff v. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya,</i> 233 F.3d 73, 77 (1st Cir.2000), but simply developed and implemented an anti-sexual harassment policy that does not adequately protect its employees from all forms of actionable sexual harassment. L.L. Bean's failure, therefore, is distinguishable from traditional discriminatory polices and practices such as refusing to hire women or paying women less than men. Moreover, L.L. Bean's ineffective sexual discrimination policy does not discriminate against a certain class of individuals, such as women or minorities, but rather treats all employees equally inasmuch as it provides every employee the same inadequate protection. Crowley has cited no case that supports her theory that maintaining a substandard sexual harassment policy constitutes a \"discriminatory policy or practice,\" and we were unable to find any caselaw supporting this novel theory. In the circumstances, we are satisfied that based on the evidence presented at trial, the jury's conclusion that L.L. Bean committed a systemic violation is problematic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve the point definitively, however, for we are satisfied that the jury's possible error in concluding that there was a systemic violation was harmless in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Morgan.</i> Under the rule of that case it is no longer necessary for a jury to determine whether a violation is systemic or serial when considering the timeliness of a hostile work environment claim. The Court in <i>Morgan</i> explained that a \"hostile work environment claim is comprised of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one `unlawful employment practice.'\" <i>Morgan,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2074. Based on that premise, the Court held that \"consideration of the entire scope of a hostile work environment claim, including behavior alleged outside the statutory time period, is permissible for the purposes of assessing liability, so long as any act contributing to that hostile environment takes place within the statutory period.\" <i>Id.</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2068. <i>See also id.</i> at 2074 (\"Provided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by the court for the purposes of determining liability.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inasmuch as under <i>Morgan</i> the entire period during which a victim is subjected to a hostile work environment now constitutes one \"unlawful employment practice,\" <i>Morgan</i> supplants our jurisprudence on the continuing violation doctrine in hostile work environment claims, making it no longer necessary to distinguish between systemic and serial violations. And because the hostile work environment created by Juhl extended into the statutory period &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> after February 24, 1998 &#8212; Crowley satisfied the standard <i>Morgan</i> set forth and therefore was able to pursue her hostile work environment claim based partially on events that occurred outside the limitations period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>New Trial</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean argues that in the event we do not grant it judgment as a matter of law, in the alternative we should reverse the district court's order denying it a new trial. L.L. Bean's bases for a new trial include juror bias, erroneous evidentiary rulings, and improper jury instructions. We reject L.L. Bean's request for a new trial, as none of its arguments has merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Juror Bias</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean argues that it is entitled to a new trial because one of the jurors neglected to disclose her \"possible bias\" during <i>voir dire</i> by failing to reveal that she is a lawyer affiliated with the New England Research Institute who not only represented a female plaintiff in a sex discrimination suit in federal court, but also investigates and researches legal topics relating to women's health and quality of life issues. Crowley responds that L.L. Bean's charges of \"possible bias\" are purely speculative and that it has not even tried to demonstrate that the juror's background would have affected the outcome of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To secure a new trial based on a juror's inaccurate answers during <i>voir dire,</i> \"a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on <i>voir dire,</i> and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for cause.\" <i>McDonough Power Equip.,</i> 464 U.S. at 556, 104 S.Ct. at 850. When seeking a new trial based on non-disclosure of information by a juror during <i>voir dire,</i> however, a party \"must do more than raise a speculative allegation that the juror's possible bias may have influenced the outcome of the trial.\" <i>Dall,</i> 970 F.2d at 969.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean sets forth the following facts and assertions to support its argument that the juror failed to disclose her \"possible bias.\" Following the trial, the juror wrote a letter to the trial judge asking permission to speak with Crowley's attorney, explaining that she \"found the case to be most interesting, in particular because of my training as a psychologist and my interest as a research scientist.\" After the judge shared the letter with the parties, L.L. Bean discovered that the juror (1) worked for the New England Research Institute; (2) investigated and researched women's issues, including topics on women's health as well as child custody in battered-women cases; and (3) as a \"family lawyer,\" represented a woman in a federal sexual discrimination case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of the foregoing information, L.L. Bean contends that the juror was dishonest when she failed to disclose her background after the judge asked the prospective jurors during <i>voir dire</i> whether they knew \"of any reason whatever, whether I have asked you about it or not why you would have a concern about your ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror if you are selected in this case.\" Br. of Appellant at 42 (quoting Tr. of Voir Dire at 24). L.L. Bean insists that if the juror had disclosed her \"research interest in this case\" as well as her professional experience as an attorney in a sex discrimination case, it would have successfully challenged her for cause. <i>Id.</i> at 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject L.L. Bean's argument for several reasons. First, notwithstanding its assertions to the contrary, it has not demonstrated that the juror was dishonest in response to the court's question. Although L.L. Bean may believe that the juror's background and experience would make her biased, it does not follow that she believed that she could not be a fair and impartial juror because of her experiences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, L.L. Bean bases its charge of possible bias on its assumption that the juror is biased against all men and all employers because she researched women's issues and served as an attorney some years ago in a sexual discrimination suit. We agree with the district court in its assessment that \"[t]he suggestion that an interest in women's issues naturally correlates to a dislike for men and employers is\" unfounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, L.L. Bean only speculates as to whether the juror actually is biased, for it has not \"demonstrate[d] actual prejudice or bias,\" <i>Dall,</i> 970 F.2d at 969, but only has alleged \"possible bias.\" Br. of Appellant at 41. As we have stated previously, the \"`burden of proof must be sustained not as a matter of speculation, but as a demonstrable reality.'\" <i>Dall,</i> 970 F.2d at 969 (quoting <i>United States v. Vargas,</i> 606 F.2d 341, 344 (1st Cir.1979)). Therefore, because L.L. Bean has not met the standard for obtaining a new trial based on actual juror bias, we will affirm the district court's dismissal of its motion for new trial based on this ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Evidentiary Rulings</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean contends that the district court made several erroneous evidentiary rulings that entitle it to a new trial. The district court, however, did not make an error of law or abuse its discretion in any of these rulings, and therefore, we reject L.L. Bean's request for new trial based on these grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">a. <i>Team Leader Hearsay</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean asserts that the district court erred when it allowed Crowley to introduce hearsay testimony that her team leader, Peter Farley, jokingly referred to Juhl as Crowley's \"little stalker\" after she reported an incident of harassment by Juhl in April 1998. L.L. Bean contends that the court improperly allowed the statement as an admission by a party-opponent under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2), arguing that team leaders are not authorized to speak on its behalf, and therefore, \"their statements cannot be considered within the scope of their agency as an employee of L.L. Bean.\" Br. of Appellant at 46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean's argument fails for two reasons. First, the court did not allow Crowley to introduce the statement as an admission by a party-opponent under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2). Rather, the court concluded that the statement did not constitute hearsay under Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) because it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In other words, Crowley did not offer Farley's comments that Juhl is her \"little stalker\" to prove that Juhl is actually a stalker; she offered the statement to show that L.L. Bean management was aware of Juhl's behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if the district court had admitted the statement as an admission by a party-opponent under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2), we doubt that the court would have erred. Although L.L. Bean now maintains that team leaders are not supervisors and are not responsible for hiring, firing, or disciplining employees, L.L. Bean admitted at trial that team leaders are, in fact, supervisors. For instance, Human Resources manager Pat Bressette-Long testified that team leaders were part of L.L. Bean's \"leadership.\" Moreover, L.L. Bean's job descriptions state that team leaders are responsible for communicating and enforcing company policies, maintaining employee records, making recommendations on hiring, delivering disciplinary actions to employees, and handling personnel issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">b. <i>Inadmissible Lay Opinions</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean next argues that the district court improperly allowed Crowley's witnesses to offer lay opinions by characterizing Juhl's conduct toward Crowley as \"stalking.\" L.L. Bean describes these comments as a \"drive-by character assassination.\" Br. of Appellant at 49.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But Crowley's witnesses were not the only ones to use the term \"stalking.\" Human Resources manager Pat Bressette-Long and supervisor David Simmons used the term \"stalked\" in their notes from their meeting with Crowley after Juhl broke into her home. Moreover, even L.L. Bean's attorneys used the term \"stalked\" at trial, at one point asking Bressette-Long whether supervisor Tim Marong ever mentioned \"whether or not it was his conclusion that Ms. Crowley was being stalked or that is what [Crowley] had said to him.\" And in response, Bressette-Long stated that Crowley had, in fact, told Marong that she was being stalked. In the circumstances, we reject L.L. Bean's argument on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">c. <i>Non-Workplace Conduct</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying its motion <i>in limine</i> to exclude evidence of Juhl's non-workplace conduct, such as Crowley's encounters with him at a bar and at the L.L. Bean Christmas party in 1996, his following her home one night in 1996, and his breaking into her home in February 1997.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See</i> Br. of Appellant at 51. L.L. Bean failed, however, to make a timely objection at trial to evidence relating to Juhl's non-workplace conduct. L.L. Bean only objected to \"time-barred\" evidence and actually stated to the district court that the jury \"may take into consideration conduct that occurred off premises in determining whether the conduct at work was hostile environment.\" Thus, L.L. Bean invited the ruling of which it now complains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo that L.L. Bean had preserved its objection, the district court would not have erred in allowing evidence relating to non-workplace conduct. L.L. Bean opines that it cannot prevent and therefore should not be liable for an employee's off-site behavior. Consequently, L.L. Bean believes that any evidence of non-workplace conduct and interactions is irrelevant and should be precluded. Courts, however, do permit evidence of non-workplace conduct to help determine the severity and pervasiveness of the hostility in the workplace as well as to establish that the conduct was motivated by gender. For example, in <i>O'Rourke,</i> we affirmed a verdict in favor of a sexual harassment victim who had offered evidence that she had received crank phone calls at home. <i>See O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 724. In this case, Juhl's intimidating behavior and hostile interactions with Crowley outside of work help explain why she was so frightened of Juhl and why his constant presence around her at work created a hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">d. <i>L.L Bean's Investigation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean contends that the district court improperly excluded as hearsay certain documents relating to its investigation of a confrontation between Crowley and Juhl on June 23, 1998. L.L. Bean asserts that a report prepared by team leader Leo Davis \"paints a very different picture [of Juhl] than the caricature presented by Crowley,\" and the court's exclusion of the report of the investigation \"significantly hamstrung [L.L. Bean] in presenting its defense.\" Br. of Appellant at 53.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from explaining how critical it believes that this report was to its defense, L.L. Bean does not indicate the reasons why the district court's exclusion of the documents was improper or the basis for admitting the documents. L.L. Bean mentions in its brief that Davis interviewed witnesses to the confrontation as well as Juhl and Crowley. If that is the case, L.L. Bean would have to overcome a double hearsay problem for the evidence to be admissible. <i>See United States v. Reilly,</i> 33 F.3d 1396, 1410 (3d Cir.1994). L.L. Bean does not, however, attempt to find exceptions to address the multiple layers of hearsay. Moreover, L.L. Bean does not explain why the information in the report could not have been elicited through direct testimony rather than through the hearsay document. Overall, we are satisfied that L.L. Bean has not demonstrated on appeal that the district court abused its discretion in disallowing the documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Jury Instructions</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean's last rationale for requesting a new trial is to claim that the district court provided flawed jury instructions. <i>See</i> Br. of Appellant at 55-60. It argues that the court gave erroneous instructions on the elements of a systemic violation by failing to make clear that Crowley had to prove that it maintained a discriminatory policy or practice relating to hiring, training, promotions, firing, and compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if these jury instructions were flawed legally as L.L. Bean contends, we conclude that the error was harmless in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Morgan.</i> As we already explained above, <i>Morgan</i> eliminates the need for juries to determine whether there was a systemic or serial violation in order to invoke the continuing violations doctrine and thus to allow consideration of discriminatory acts that fell outside the limitations period. The Court explained in <i>Morgan</i> that \"[p]rovided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by the court for the purposes of determining liability.\" <i>Morgan,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2074. Moreover, the asserted error would not have contributed to the jury's finding that the violation was ongoing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, L.L. Bean argues that the district court erred by refusing to instruct the jury that it must determine whether a hostile work environment existed based on Juhl's behavior at work, not his non-workplace conduct. <i>See</i> Br. of Appellant at 56. As with L.L. Bean's challenge to the court's evidentiary ruling allowing evidence of Juhl's non-workplace conduct, Crowley maintains that L.L. Bean actually waived its objection by telling the district court that the jury could \"take into consideration conduct that occurred off premises in determining whether the conduct at work was hostile environment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not L.L. Bean waived its objection, it is inconceivable to us that the jury could have found L.L. Bean liable for maintaining a hostile work environment by disregarding the overwhelming amount of evidence of Juhl's harassment on L.L. Bean's premises and instead basing its verdict on the comparatively few incidents involving Juhl's non-workplace conduct. As such, we conclude that even if it would have been advisable to charge the jury as L.L. Bean had requested, the district court's refusal to do so did not affect L.L. Bean's \"substantial rights\" and therefore amounts to nothing more than harmless error under Fed.R.Civ.P. 61. <i>Cigna Ins. Co. v. Oy Saunatec, Ltd.,</i> 241 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the order of the district court denying L.L.

Bean's appeal from the district court's order entered November 8, 2001, denying its motion for judgment as a matter of law or, in the alternative, for a new trial. For the reasons stated herein, we affirm the order of the district court and uphold the jury verdict in favor of plaintiff-appellee Eileen Crowley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We briefly describe the facts at the outset, but discuss them in greater detail where applicable and essential to explain our determinations. Since 1992, Crowley has worked for L.L. Bean, a major catalog retailer based in Freeport, Maine, specializing in outdoor apparel and merchandise. In 1996, she began working as an \"order picker operator\" in L.L. Bean's warehouses and in this capacity drove 22,000-pound forklift-like machines called transtackers that collect merchandise for packing and shifting. Crowley claims that from 1996 until July 1998, her co-worker, Paul Juhl, stalked and harassed her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Evidence at trial supported a conclusion that during the period involved, Juhl engaged in disturbing and sometimes peculiar behavior around Crowley, including grabbing her foot and massaging it against her will at an L.L. Bean pool party, continually following her at work even when they were not scheduled to work in the same warehouse, physically blocking her path and thereby forcing her to squeeze by him, giving her gifts designed to let her know that he was watching her, dancing in the aisles near her, waiting in the dark for her to come upon him, following her home, and even breaking into her house. Crowley reported most of these incidents to her team leaders or supervisors, but she claims that L.L. Bean did not take timely effective action to protect her from Juhl and therefore maintained a hostile work environment. L.L.

Bean had engaged in sex discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (\"Title VII\"), 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e <i>et seq.,</i> and the Maine Human Rights Act, Me. Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 4572 (West 2002). After the EEOC issued a right-to-sue letter and the Maine Human Rights Commission determined that L.L. Bean had not engaged in either sex discrimination or retaliation, Crowley filed her complaint in the district court on June 22, 2000, asserting that L.L. Bean had engaged in sex discrimination in violation of Title VII and the Maine Human Rights Act predicated on her assertion that she had been subjected to a hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury trial began on June 5, 2001, and concluded on June 11, 2001.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> L.L. Bean moved for judgment as a matter of law pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. 50 at the conclusion of Crowley's case-in-chief and renewed the motion after both parties rested. Before submitting the case to the jury, the court partially granted the motion but only as to Crowley's claim for punitive damages under the Maine Human Rights Act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After one day of deliberations, the jury returned its verdict on June 13, 2001, finding that L.L. Bean had violated Title VII by sexually discriminating against Crowley through acts occurring on or after February 24, 1998. The February 24, 1998 date was critical because Crowley filed her EEOC claim 300 days after that date and she was required to file the charge within the 300-day period for it to be timely.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The jury also found that the unlawful discrimination was the result of a systemic violation, but not of a serial violation. The jury found, however, that L.L. Bean had not violated the Maine Human Rights Act by sexually discriminating against Crowley through acts occurring on or after June 22, 1998. The June 22, 1998 date was applicable because the Maine Human Rights Act has a two-year statute of limitations, and Crowley initiated this action on June 22, 2000. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 5, &#167; 4613(2)(C) (West 2002).

L.L. Bean asserts that Crowley presented insufficient evidence at trial to satisfy three elements of her hostile work environment claim &#8212; namely, that Crowley perceived Juhl's behavior as \"subjectively abusive,\" that Juhl's conduct was \"severe and pervasive,\" and that L.L. Bean knew or should have known about Juhl's alleged harassment, but failed to take prompt or appropriate action to remedy the situation.

Bean predicates its argument on two critical suppositions: (1) Title VII's administrative filing requirements precluded the jury from considering allegations of harassment that occurred before February 24, 1998; and (2) the jury's verdict on the state law claim established that Crowley was not harassed after June 22, 1998. Thus, L.L. Bean effectively seeks to cabin Crowley's claim to the end that it is based only on events occurring during a four-month period. L.L. Bean then argues that the \"handful of incidents\" that occurred during that four-month period between February 24, 1998, and June 22, 1998, are insufficient to support the jury's verdict. Br. of Appellant at 6.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Supreme Court's recent decision in <i>National Railroad Passenger Corp. v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">106</span></a></span> (2002), severely undermines L.L. Bean's argument. In <i>Morgan,</i> the Court held that \"consideration of the entire scope of a hostile work environment claim, including behavior alleged outside the statutory time period, is permissible for the purposes of assessing liability, so long as any act contributing to that hostile environment takes place within the statutory time period.\" <i>Id.</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2068. The Court explained that a \"hostile work environment claim is comprised of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one `unlawful employment practice.'\" <i>Id.</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2074. Thus, \"[p]rovided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by the court for the purposes of determining liability.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, in the wake of <i>Morgan,</i> the jury not only could consider Juhl's conduct prior to February 24, 1998, as \"relevant background evidence,\" <i>United Air Lines, Inc. v.

Bean liable for the alleged acts of harassment that fell outside the 300-day period for filing an EEOC charge of sexual discrimination provided that it found that there was an act contributing to the hostile environment within the 300-day filing period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Notwithstanding the thrust of L.L. Bean's argument that Crowley's allegations of harassment included only \"a few brief encounters\" between her and Juhl that were \"scarcely threatening,\" Br. of Appellant at 24, 31, Crowley offered evidence at trial establishing that Juhl's harassment began in the fall of 1996 and continued into July 1998, and thus L.L. Bean's argument is flawed. Consequently, we must review all such evidence offered at trial when determining whether the jury verdict is supported by the evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we have indicated, L.L. Bean also asserts that we must disregard any evidence of sexual harassment on or after June 22, 1998, because the jury found that it had not violated the Maine Human Rights Act by sexually discriminating against her by acts occurring on or after that date. Although this evidence appears to be of limited significance inasmuch as Crowley alleges only a few incidents of alleged harassment by Juhl after June 22, 1998, L.L. Bean is wrong on this point, too. In basing its argument on the portion of the jury's verdict that L.L. Bean had not sexually discriminated against Crowley on or after June 22, 1998, L.L. Bean assumes that the jury concluded that the hostile work environment ceased to exist on June 22, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But the jury's determination that L.L. Bean was not liable for maintaining a hostile work environment under the state statute based solely on incidents that occurred on or after June 22 does not mean that the jury was &#8212; and, therefore, this court is &#8212; precluded from considering any evidence relating to Juhl's post-June 22 conduct when determining L.L. Bean's liability under Title VII. As Crowley argues in her brief, \"[t]he fact that the number of incidents from June 23 forward do not constitute a violation of state law by themselves has no logical connection to whether those incidents can be considered, together with earlier incidents, under federal law.\" Br. of Appellee at 17.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, L.L. Bean draws too many conclusions from the jury's verdict. For instance, the jury may have found for L.L. Bean on the state law claim because it concluded that Crowley had not satisfied the employer liability element of the hostile work environment claim (perhaps because it decided that L.L. Bean finally took appropriate remedial measures to end the hostile work environment on or after June 22, 1998), not because the jury believed that Crowley failed to prove that Juhl's conduct on or after June 22, 1998, was \"severe or pervasive.\" In other words, the jury may have believed that Crowley was subject to a hostile work environment on or after June 22, 1998, but that L.L. Bean nevertheless should not be held liable for Juhl's conduct on or after that date. Because we have no way of knowing the jury's reason for rendering its verdict on the state law claim, L.L. Bean's argument that we cannot consider evidence relating to events on or after June 22, 1998, must fail. Therefore, we will consider all of the evidence offered at trial regarding Juhl's harassment from the fall of 1996 through July of 1998 in determining whether the evidence supports the jury's verdict that L.L. Bean maintained a hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">a. <i>Subjectively Abusive</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean first argues that the jury's verdict should be overturned because Crowley did not offer any evidence demonstrating that Juhl's conduct was \"subjectively abusive.\" It asserts that \"[s]ince Crowley did not believe that Juhl was sexually harassing her until June 23, 1998, ... Crowley did not subjectively believe that she was being subjected to a hostile work environment during the statutory period.\" Br. of Appellant at 19 (citations to the record omitted). L.L. Bean seizes on the June 23, 1998 date because Crowley testified that until that date, she thought the team leaders adequately were taking care of the Juhl situation and therefore she had no complaints regarding what L.L. Bean was doing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject this argument, as L.L. Bean misapprehends what Crowley was required to \"subjectively perceive.\" As Crowley points out in her brief, although the victim must subjectively perceive the harasser's conduct to be \"hostile or abusive,\" the victim need not subjectively believe that the conduct met the legal definition of unlawful sexual harassment. <i>See</i> Br. of Appellee at 14. At trial, Crowley testified that she was frightened and feared for her safety because Juhl was stalking her. <i>See Tr.</i> 94, 109 (she was \"scared\"); 93 (she \"was scared to death\"); 123, 127, 131 (she was \"shaking\"); 127 (she \"was breaking down\"); 130 (she \"felt real shaky inside\"); 146 (she was \"[r]eally upset\"); 135 (she \"felt like [she] was going to get hurt\"). Furthermore, Crowley offered into evidence a copy of L.L. Bean's written warning to Juhl, in which it informed Juhl that he has \"created a hostile environment in which [Crowley] felt physically threatened.\" App. 99.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Therefore, although Crowley may not have realized until June 1998 that Juhl's conduct actually constituted sexual harassment, she did present evidence establishing that she earlier considered Juhl's behavior threatening and hostile. Consequently, contrary to L.L. Bean's assertion, Crowley presented sufficient evidence for a rational jury to find that she perceived Juhl's conduct to be \"hostile or abusive.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">b. <i>Severe or Pervasive</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean next argues that Crowley's \"eight encounters\" with Juhl during the four-month period were not objectively \"severe and pervasive\" enough to create a hostile work environment, insisting that Crowley's allegations \"`are so trivial, so isolated, and so far from the paradigmatic case of sexual harassment' that judgment as a matter of law is `clearly appropriate.'\" Br. of Appellant at 20-21 (quoting <i>Hartsell v. Duplex Prod., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"745391\"><a href=\"/opinion/745391/74-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1495-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44943-margaret/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">766</span></a></span>, 773 (4th Cir.1997)). L.L. Bean contends that Crowley's hostile work environment claim is supported merely by</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">evidence that Juhl gave her a book, came to the wrong building where she was working on three occasions, operated his machine in her vicinity on occasion (and told her once `it will cost you' when she asked him to move), and came out of a tunnel dancing on one occasion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Reply Br. of Appellant at 9. As we explained above, <i>Morgan</i> fatally undermines this argument, for Crowley's allegations do not merely include eight incidents, but involve alleged acts of harassment and stalking that spanned nearly one and a half years. Accordingly, we will review evidence relating to all of Crowley's allegations &#8212; not just those of acts that occurred between February 24, 1998, and June 22, 1998 &#8212; to determine whether Juhl's conduct was sufficiently \"severe or pervasive\" to constitute actionable harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowley presented the following evidence to support her hostile work environment claim. In 1996, at an L.L. Bean pool party, Juhl grabbed her foot and massaged it against her will. He told her that she was the \"perfect woman\" and that she had \"perfect women's feet.\" Juhl also gave Crowley gifts intended to let her know that he was watching her both at and outside of work. He even followed her home one evening by turning off his headlights and pursuing her car in the dark. At an L.L. Bean party in December 1996, he again stated that Crowley was the perfect woman and pinpointed the exact location of her house on a map, letting her know that he knew exactly where she lived. Crowley reported these incidents to her team leader, David Baker.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1997, Juhl followed Crowley at work and bothered her, sometimes lurking in the dark outside the women's bathroom while he waited for her to emerge. He often parked next to her car in the parking lot and followed her to her car when she was leaving work. He also used L.L. Bean's hand-held computer units to track Crowley's movement within the warehouse. Juhl frequently blocked her in the aisles and forced her to squeeze by him. Crowley reported all of these incidents to her supervisor, Tim Marong, who remarked that Juhl was stalking her.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 16, 1997, Juhl broke into Crowley's home while she was there. He tried to get her to touch his clothing, and he grabbed her wrists in an attempt to bring her upstairs with him. He not only told her that he wanted to date her, but admitted that he had been at her house previously and described what outfits she had been wearing on those occasions. Crowley explained that she had a boyfriend, but Juhl responded, \"but he's never here.\" After he finally left, Crowley saw him outside peering in different windows of her house. She hid in the bathroom until he left.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As she had done previously, Crowley reported this incident to her supervisors. She told her team leaders, her supervisor Tim Marong, and L.L. Bean's Human Resources personnel that she believed she was being stalked. Indeed, Marong testified that he thought that Juhl's conduct could have constituted sexual harassment. Marong contacted Pat Bressette-Long, a Human Resources supervisor, who met with Crowley several weeks later. Crowley informed Bressette-Long not only about Juhl's uninvited entry into her home, but also about his intimidating behavior at work. When Crowley asked whether she should notify the plant manager, Frank Johnson, about Juhl's conduct, Bressette-Long advised her not to break the chain of command, but to continue reporting her complaints to her immediate supervisor. One month after Crowley met with Bressette-Long, Juhl was reassigned to a separate work area.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From March 1997 until the summer of 1997, Juhl continued to work near Crowley, even when he was scheduled to work elsewhere. He also continued his familiar conduct of blocking her in the aisles with his transtacker and dancing near her. She reported Juhl's disturbing and sometimes bizarre behavior to her team leader and Human Resources, which assured her that Juhl would be scheduled to work in a different warehouse. Despite these assurances, however, in May 1997, L.L. Bean permitted Juhl to volunteer to work shifts in her warehouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the summer of 1997, Juhl's conduct did not change, as he kept trying to be near Crowley. He not only continued to corner her and make her ask him to move out of the way, but also began hiding in dark areas of the warehouse where Crowley would come upon him. Crowley notified her team leader, Leo Davis, about Juhl's conduct, but he did nothing, even though he promised to investigate the matter. Meanwhile, Juhl's behavior continued unabated. In July 1997, he appeared unexpectedly in her work area 15 or more times, lingered around the time clock at the end of Crowley's shift, and stood close to her on numerous occasions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the fall and early winter of 1997, Crowley saw Juhl so often in her work area that she assumed that they were working the same shift. She later learned that Juhl actually was working the wrong shift with management's knowledge. Co-workers also noticed Juhl's conduct, prompting one witness to remark, \"Wherever she was, he was.\" In fact, one L.L. Bean witness testified that he believed Juhl was sexually attracted to Crowley, explaining that \"it was kind of obvious the way he handled himself.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1998, Crowley briefly was assigned to work an 8:00 a.m.-4:30 p.m. shift and therefore maintained little contact with Juhl. This respite was short-lived, however, for L.L. Bean soon placed her back on the third shift with Juhl. She notified her supervisor, Bob Anderson, that she was scared and asked for a parking space closer to the building so that she would not be alone with Juhl. Anderson stated that he was aware of her problems with Juhl, but that he had to put her back on Juhl's shift for business reasons.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In February 1998, Juhl's contact with Crowley intensified. He gave her a book on holistic cancer therapy after her friend's mother died of cancer. Crowley maintains that Juhl could have known about the death of her friend's mother only by following Crowley. Crowley told her team leaders about the incident and reported that he had grabbed her hands when he tried to give her the book. Juhl also drove his transtacker up and down the aisle, shadowing her movements in the adjacent aisle, and used his transtacker to block her in aisles. Crowley reported these incidents to her team leaders, David Baker and Steve McCourt, who assured her that L.L. Bean was taking her concerns seriously.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1998, L.L. Bean consolidated the first and third shifts of its distributions operation and consequently transferred Juhl to the morning shift. Despite being assigned to a different building, Juhl showed up at Crowley's building on March 30 and 31, and April 1, 1998. As one co-worker testified, Juhl \"would constantly show up in the wrong building\" during March and April 1998, and \"was constantly following her all the time, he never stopped.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1998, Juhl continued showing up in Crowley's work area, following her, and physically obstructing her from doing her work. One time, he danced in the aisle in front of her. Another time, he prevented her from passing, and when she asked him to let her by, he responded that it would \"cost her.\" When Crowley reported these incidents to her new team leader, Peter Farley, he joked about Juhl's conduct and referred to him as her \"little stalker.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From April until June 1998, Crowley's interaction with Juhl was limited, as the two worked on different shifts. Juhl nevertheless loitered around the time clock and the warehouse entrance, waiting for Crowley to come and go. On June 22, 1998, Juhl was returned to Crowley's shift. Shortly thereafter, Juhl lapsed back into his familiar pattern of behavior, blocking her in the aisles, making her beg him to move, and forcing her to squeeze by him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 23, 1998, a team leader, Leo Davis, witnessed Juhl blocking Crowley, but did nothing. Instead, Davis laughed with Juhl in front of Crowley and then looked at her, smiled, and left. Furthermore, Ken Libby, a fellow employee, warned supervisor Anderson that Crowley would end up dead if someone did not do something to stop Juhl. In addition, Bennett Schlaack, a trainer, advised three team leaders &#8212; John Andretta, Steve McCourt, and David Baker &#8212; that Juhl was shadowing Crowley and that he was concerned for her safety. L.L. Bean, however, took no action. Frustrated with L.L. Bean's ineffectiveness in protecting her from Juhl, Crowley went to the police a few days after Davis saw Juhl block Crowley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the meantime, Leo Davis was assigned to investigate a confrontation between Crowley and Juhl that occurred on the same day that Davis witnessed Juhl blocking Crowley. Aside from Davis, two other employees witnessed the incident and reported the matter to management. Crowley explained to Davis that Juhl's conduct was longstanding, but Davis indicated to her that L.L. Bean \"had to protect Paul's rights.\" During the course of Davis's investigation, Crowley was restricted to the dock area, while Juhl enjoyed full access to the warehouse. Notwithstanding Crowley's complaints, management made no effort to keep Juhl away from Crowley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 30, 1998, L.L. Bean issued a written warning to Juhl, stating that he had \"created a hostile work environment in which [Crowley] felt physically threatened\" and that his \"threatening, intimidating behavior will not be tolerated.\" The warning indicated that Juhl \"must take action to avoid further contact with Eileen Crowley.\" The Human Resources official who issued the warning, Rebecca Batchelder, testified that she did not know that L.L. Bean already had issued a directive in the spring of 1997 requiring that Juhl and Crowley work in separate buildings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During Davis's investigation when Crowley and Juhl were separated at work and even after Juhl received his written warning instructing him to stay away from Crowley, Juhl continued following Crowley around at work. Sometime after June 24, 1998, Crowley again complained to her team leader, Peter Farley, that Juhl was violating the standing order that he and Crowley be kept separated, but Farley took no action other than to suggest that Crowley have her boyfriend give Juhl a \"blanket party.\" On July 7, 1998, after Farley again allowed Juhl and Crowley to work in the same area, Crowley returned to the police department and obtained a temporary protection order against Juhl. The police served Juhl with the order at work on the same day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thereafter, L.L. Bean placed Juhl on paid leave pending the court hearing on Crowley's request for a protection order. On July 17, 1998, Crowley obtained a permanent court protection order against Juhl. On July 24, 1998, L.L. Bean terminated Juhl's employment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As is quite evident, Crowley presented evidence relating to more than just eight innocuous encounters between her and Juhl. In fact, she provided ample evidence to establish that Juhl engaged in a longstanding pattern of hostile and intimidating behavior towards her that spanned over one and a half years. To prevail on this appeal, L.L. Bean must demonstrate that no reasonable person could have reached the conclusion of the jury, even after viewing all of the evidence in the light most favorable to the verdict. Based on the evidence adduced at trial, it cannot be said that a reasonable person could not have concluded that Juhl's conduct towards Crowley was \"severe or pervasive.\" Indeed, as the EEOC wrote in its amicus brief, \"by focusing only on the specific incidents which occurred after February 24, Bean fails to capture the residual and cumulative effect that Juhl's campaign of harassment had on Crowley's working conditions even on days when she did not encounter him.\" Amicus Br. of EEOC at 21. Consequently, Crowley presented sufficient evidence at trial to satisfy this element of her hostile work environment claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">c. <i>Employer Liability</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean finally argues with respect to the hostile work environment claim that Crowley failed to offer sufficient evidence to establish employer liability. Although this appears to be L.L. Bean's best argument to the extent that it challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to support the verdict, it nevertheless is unable to meet the onerous burden of proving that a reasonable person could not have concluded that, after it learned of Juhl's behavior, it failed to take appropriate steps to stop Juhl's harassment and stalking of Crowley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A plaintiff must satisfy different standards for establishing employer liability in a hostile work environment case depending on whether the harasser is a supervisor or co-employee of the victim. In this case, it is beyond dispute that Juhl and Crowley were co-employees. To establish employer liability for a non-supervisory co-employee, a plaintiff must demonstrate that the employer \"`knew or should have known of the charged sexual harassment and failed to implement prompt and appropriate action.'\" <i>White,</i> 221 F.3d at 261 (quoting <i>Blankenship v. Parke Care Ctrs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"745400\"><a href=\"/opinion/745400/75-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1351-71-empl-prac-dec-p-44965-leanna-c/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">868</span></a></span>, 872 (6th Cir.1997)). L.L. Bean maintains that Crowley did not present sufficient evidence to satisfy either prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">i. <i>Whether L.L. Bean Knew or Should Have Known</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The evidence offered at trial, if viewed in the light most favorable to Crowley, clearly supports a jury finding that L.L. Bean knew or should have known that Juhl was harassing and stalking Crowley. L.L. Bean bases its misguided argument to the contrary on its restricted temporal view of the evidence, but as we explained above, the statute of limitations did not preclude the jury &#8212; and therefore does not preclude us &#8212; from considering evidence relating to harassment before February 24, 1998, and the jury verdict on the state law claim does not preclude us from considering evidence relating to harassment on or after June 22, 1998. Therefore, we must consider all of the evidence, from 1996 until July 1998, to determine whether it was sufficient to support a jury finding that L.L. Bean knew about Juhl's conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowley presented ample evidence that she reported Juhl's behavior to her team leaders, supervisors, and Human Resources. Crowley began notifying her supervisors of Juhl's disturbing behavior in 1996, when she informed her team leader, David Baker, that Juhl was harassing and following her both on and off L.L. Bean's premises. In January 1997, she told her team leader, John Andretta, and her supervisor, Tim Marong, that Juhl was bothering her at work, tracking her movements with the hand-held computers, waiting for her in the dark outside the women's bathroom, blocking her in the aisles with his transtacker, and forcing her to squeeze by him. After Juhl broke into her home in February 1997, she reported the incident to team leaders Andretta and Steve McCourt, supervisor Marong, and Human Resources.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the spring of 1997, Crowley advised her new team leader, Baker, that Juhl was continuing to show up in her building and block her in the aisles. In April and May 1997, after Crowley twice told Human Resources about Juhl's stalking behavior, Human Resources assured her Juhl would be scheduled for work in a different warehouse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the summer of 1997, Crowley notified her team leader, Leo Davis, that Juhl always was trying to be near her and that he hid in the dark, waiting for her to come upon him. In September 1997, she told her team leader, Keith Menard, that Juhl was showing up repeatedly in her work area, even though he was working a different shift.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1998, after being put back on the first shift with Juhl, Crowley informed her supervisor, Bob Anderson, that she was scared of Juhl and had concerns about working on the same shift with him. In February 1998, Crowley reported to her team leaders, Baker and McCourt, that Juhl was shadowing her movements in his transtacker. During L.L. Bean's shift consolidation in March 1998, Crowley complained to Baker that Juhl had come to the wrong building three days in a row.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In April 1998, Crowley told her new team leader, Peter Farley, that Juhl was physically blocking her from doing her work, but Farley laughed about Juhl's behavior and referred to him as her \"little stalker.\" In late June 1998, Crowley again complained to Farley that Juhl was violating the standing directive that he and Crowley be kept separated at work, but Farley did nothing to remedy the situation. In July 1998, after Juhl was issued a written warning requiring him to stay away from Crowley but before L.L. Bean placed him on unpaid leave, Farley allowed Juhl to work in Crowley's vicinity despite her previous complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to Crowley's repeated complaints to her team leaders and supervisors about Juhl's conduct, Crowley's co-workers also reported Juhl's behavior and expressed their concerns for her safety. <i>See, e.g., Sims v. Health Midwest Physician Servs. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766796\"><a href=\"/opinion/766796/vera-sims-v-health-midwest-physician-services-corporation-a-missouri/\"><span class=\"volume\">196</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">915</span></a></span>, 921 (8th Cir.1999) (\"Notification of sexual harassment to an employer need not come solely from the victim of the harassment for knowledge to be imputed to the employer.\"). For instance, Ken Libby, a fellow employee, warned supervisor Anderson that Crowley would end up dead if someone did not do something to stop Juhl. Another fellow employee, Alan Coffin, alerted Anderson to Juhl's odd practice of dancing near Crowley. In addition, Bennett Schlaack, a trainer, advised three team leaders &#8212; Andretta, McCourt, and Baker &#8212; that Juhl was shadowing Crowley and that he was concerned for her safety.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, Crowley presented evidence that L.L. Bean managers, team leaders, and supervisors were aware of Juhl's conduct and that at times they even characterized it as harassment. For example, after Juhl broke into Crowley's home in February 1997, Crowley spoke with both her supervisor, Tim Marong, and a Human Resources supervisor, Pat Bressette-Long. Marong's memo notes that Crowley \"felt that Paul was stalking her,\" and Bressette-Long's hand-written notes state that \"Eileen Crowley feels like she is being stalked.\" The Security Department investigated a complaint Crowley advanced in May 1997 and described her grievance as a \"sexual harassment complaint\" in a document distributed to \"management\" &#8212; specifically, to manager Tim Parker. After Crowley asked her supervisor, Bob Anderson, to put her back on the first shift in January 1998 because she was concerned about Juhl, Anderson sent an email to other management personnel stating that everyone was fully aware of the situation between Crowley and Juhl. Crowley's team leader, John Andretta, testified at trial that \"it was obvious everybody knew of the Juhl/Eileen situation and how he was following her around, always being where she was.\" Finally, the written warning to Juhl on June 30, 1998, indicated that he had \"created a hostile work environment in which [Crowley] felt physically threatened\" and that his \"threatening, intimidating behavior will not be tolerated.\" At bottom, L.L. Bean's contention that Crowley did not properly notify management of her complaints because she \"bypass[ed] the reporting requirements under L.L. Bean's harassment policies,\" Br. of Appellant at 28, is without merit, for Crowley and her co-workers repeatedly alerted team leaders and supervisors about Juhl's conduct. L.L. Bean representatives admitted that the proper procedure for an employee to report a claim of harassment was to notify his or her team leader. Once a team leader received a complaint from an employee, it was the team leader's duty to report the complaint up the chain of command to his or her supervisor. Therefore, by maintaining a policy that permitted workers to report sexual harassment claims to team leaders, L.L. Bean provided these team leaders with actual authority to receive notice of sexual harassment complaints on behalf of the company, and their knowledge was imputed to it. <i>See, e.g., Sims,</i> 196 F.3d at 920 (stating that \"employer liability could attach if information of the harassment had come to the attention of someone who is reasonably believed to have a duty to pass on the information\"). As such, Crowley provided sufficient evidence for a reasonable jury to find that L.L. Bean knew or should have known about Juhl's harassment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">ii. <i>Whether L.L. Bean Took Prompt and Appropriate Action</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean contends that the evidence offered at trial did not support a jury finding that it failed to take prompt and appropriate remedial action after receiving Crowley's complaints. In fact, it asserts that \"[w]hen Crowley conveyed her concerns previously to a supervisor or a human resources representative, L.L. Bean took immediate action.\" Br. of Appellant at 28. L.L. Bean argues:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ultimately, Crowley's argument boils down to a claim that L.L. Bean is strictly liable for any encounter between Crowley and Juhl because its prior warnings to Juhl to stay away from Crowley and not to bother her, and its prior actions in separating them, were not 100 percent effective in preventing Crowley and Juhl from ever crossing paths again. Suffice it to say, this is not the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 31.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, reasonable jurors might have agreed with L.L. Bean's argument that, although its remedial actions were not 100% effective, it did take prompt and appropriate action and therefore should not be liable for Juhl's unlawful conduct. There is some force to its argument that inasmuch as Crowley actually conceded in her testimony that she was pleased with L.L. Bean's responses to her complaints prior to June 23, 1998,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> it should escape liability. <i>See</i> Br. of Appellant at 28. Having said that, however, we do not review the jury's findings <i>de novo,</i> but instead must uphold the jury verdict unless no reasonable person could have reached its conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The jury obviously concluded that L.L. Bean did not take prompt and appropriate action to protect Crowley from Juhl, and this conclusion was not unreasonable. Aside from suspending and eventually terminating Juhl after Crowley obtained a permanent court protection order against him, the only significant remedial action L.L. Bean ever took to protect Crowley from Juhl was to schedule Crowley and Juhl in different buildings or on different shifts. For instance, after Juhl broke into Crowley's home in February 1997, Human Resources ordered that Juhl and Crowley be kept separated. Then, after disregarding numerous complaints by Crowley over the ensuing year and a half, L.L. Bean finally issued a written warning to Juhl in June 1998 for \"creat[ing] a hostile work environment in which [Crowley] felt physically threatened\" and ordered him to \"take action to avoid further contact with Eileen Crowley.\" In short, L.L. Bean adopted the same remedial action in June 1998 as it had in February 1997, even though (1) the earlier action had proven ineffective, (2) Crowley repeatedly had complained to her team leaders and supervisors that Juhl wantonly ignored the directive, (3) supervisors often failed to abide by the policy and permitted Juhl and Crowley to work together, and (4) the cumulative effect of Juhl's conduct over the year-and-a-half period only had exacerbated the hostile work environment in which Crowley was forced to work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Consequently, although L.L. Bean may have made a good faith effort to implement an effective remedial measure in February 1997, it could not turn a blind eye towards the measure's ineffectiveness over the following 18 months, only to reinstitute the same inadequate remedial measure in response to its finding that Juhl had subjected Crowley to a hostile work environment. Thus, based on L.L. Bean's pattern of indifference towards Crowley's complaints about Juhl between February 1997 and June 1998, it cannot be said that a reasonable jury could not find that L.L. Bean failed to take prompt and appropriate action to protect Crowley from Juhl.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, notwithstanding L.L. Bean's assertion that it \"took immediate action\" in response to each of Crowley's complaints, Crowley offered ample testimony supporting her position that L.L. Bean ignored many complaints she and her co-workers submitted concerning Juhl's behavior. Rather than reiterate each instance in which L.L. Bean failed to respond to Crowley's complaints, we simply will direct the parties to our summary of the evidence above. <i>See supra</i> Part III.A.1.b. There, one will see that L.L. Bean did not respond to Crowley's complaints to Human Resources in May 1997, to Leo Davis in the summer of 1997, to Bob Anderson in January 1998, to David Baker and Steve McCourt in February 1998, to Peter Farley in April 1998, to Leo Davis again in June 1998, and to Peter Farley again in June 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, we believe that a determination of whether L.L. Bean should be liable for Juhl's conduct by reason of its failure to take prompt and appropriate action to protect Crowley from Juhl raised a question that the jury might have resolved either way. As already noted, however, our task is not to determine whether we agree with the jury's verdict, but to determine whether a reasonable person could have arrived at its conclusion. In light of the heavy burden placed on L.L. Bean to overturn the verdict based on sufficiency of the evidence grounds, we conclude that Crowley presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable person to conclude that L.L. Bean failed to take prompt and appropriate action to put an end to Juhl's stalking of Crowley. Therefore, we will not upset the verdict based on L.L. Bean's argument that the evidence was insufficient to support it, and thus, we will not reverse the order of the district court denying L.L. Bean judgment as a matter of law on this basis.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Systemic Violation Claim</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean next challenges the jury's finding that it committed a systemic violation. It argues that Crowley failed to present evidence that it maintained a \"discriminatory policy or practice.\" It also contends that its alleged failure to recognize that Juhl was stalking and sexually harassing Crowley is not sufficient to hold it liable for a systemic violation. <i>See</i> Br. of Appellant at 40.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already explained, Title VII required Crowley to file her charge of employment discrimination with the EEOC within 300 days of the alleged sexual harassment. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000e-5(e)(1). The continuing violation doctrine, however, \"creates an equitable exception to the 300-day limitation when the unlawful behavior is deemed ongoing.\" <i>Provencher v. CVS Pharmacy, Div. of Melville Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"754633\"><a href=\"/opinion/754633/76-fair-emplpraccas-bna-1569-73-empl-prac-dec-p-45393-richard/\"><span class=\"volume\">145</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span>, 14 (1st Cir.1998). Traditionally we have recognized that \"[c]ontinuing violations may be serial or systemic\" and have distinguished between such violations. <i>Id.</i> \"Systemic violations occur where an employer maintains a discriminatory policy, responsible for multiple discriminatory acts that fall outside the limitations period.\" <i>Rivera-Rodriguez v. Frito Lay Snacks Caribbean,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"774877\"><a href=\"/opinion/774877/victor-f-rivera-rodriguez-sandra-beltran-mcentee-conjugal-partnership/\"><span class=\"volume\">265</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir.2001) (citing <i>Pilgrim v. Trustees of Tufts College,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197455\"><a href=\"/opinion/197455/pilgrim-v-tufts-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">864</span></a></span>, 869 (1st Cir.1997)). On the other hand, there is a serial violation \"where the plaintiff experiences a number of discriminatory acts arising from the same discriminatory animus.\" <i>Id.</i> at 22. In this case, the district court in recognition of the case law at the time of the trial instructed the jury on the distinction between continuing and systemic violations. The jury then found that L.L. Bean had committed a systemic violation, but not a serial violation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Crowley submits that the jury's verdict is supportable because L.L. Bean's sexual harassment policy is fundamentally flawed insofar as it prohibits only sexually offensive behavior, not nonsexual conduct motivated by gender bias. Crowley contends that L.L. Bean's sexual harassment policy \"by definition fails to address a wide range of illegal harassment that is directed at a victim because of gender but that does not fall within the stereotypical scenario of pin-ups, breast-grabbing, and lewd comments.\" Br. of Appellee at 32. Consequently, according to Crowley's theory, L.L. Bean committed a systemic continuing violation by maintaining a sexual harassment policy that led its managers and supervisors to identify Juhl's stalking and harassment of Crowley as non-sexual conduct that did not warrant investigation or remediation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Clearly there is factual support for Crowley's argument inasmuch as L.L. Bean's sexual harassment policy focuses primarily on sex-related conduct, rather than on nonsexual &#8212; yet inappropriate &#8212; behavior motivated by gender. Indeed, L.L. Bean's employee guide provides, in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally speaking, sexual harassment is defined as conduct or behavior that is intimidating, hostile, offensive and/or interferes with an employee's work performance. It includes conduct that creates a hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Some examples of harassing behaviors include, but are not limited to:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Offensive sexual flirtations</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Verbal or physical abuse of a sexual nature</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Sexually suggestive gestures Advances or propositions</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; The display of sexually suggestive objects, pictures, or written materials</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Lewd nicknames</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">&amp;#x2022; Sexual practical jokes or horseplay</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p79\">\n      <span class=\"num\">79</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">App. 111-12. Furthermore, a Human Resources manager testified that L.L. Bean's sexual harassment policy related to \"sexual acts\" rather than nonsexual conduct motivated by gender and that L.L. Bean's policy did not prohibit an employee from stalking a person because of his or her gender.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p80\">\n      <span class=\"num\">80</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, it does not appear that L.L. Bean itself maintained a \"discriminatory policy or practice,\" <i>Megwinoff v. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199163\"><a href=\"/opinion/199163/andreu-megwinoff-v-banco-bilbao/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">73</span></a></span>, 77 (1st Cir.2000), but simply developed and implemented an anti-sexual harassment policy that does not adequately protect its employees from all forms of actionable sexual harassment. L.L. Bean's failure, therefore, is distinguishable from traditional discriminatory polices and practices such as refusing to hire women or paying women less than men. Moreover, L.L. Bean's ineffective sexual discrimination policy does not discriminate against a certain class of individuals, such as women or minorities, but rather treats all employees equally inasmuch as it provides every employee the same inadequate protection. Crowley has cited no case that supports her theory that maintaining a substandard sexual harassment policy constitutes a \"discriminatory policy or practice,\" and we were unable to find any caselaw supporting this novel theory. In the circumstances, we are satisfied that based on the evidence presented at trial, the jury's conclusion that L.L. Bean committed a systemic violation is problematic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p81\">\n      <span class=\"num\">81</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need not resolve the point definitively, however, for we are satisfied that the jury's possible error in concluding that there was a systemic violation was harmless in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Morgan.</i> Under the rule of that case it is no longer necessary for a jury to determine whether a violation is systemic or serial when considering the timeliness of a hostile work environment claim. The Court in <i>Morgan</i> explained that a \"hostile work environment claim is comprised of a series of separate acts that collectively constitute one `unlawful employment practice.'\" <i>Morgan,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2074. Based on that premise, the Court held that \"consideration of the entire scope of a hostile work environment claim, including behavior alleged outside the statutory time period, is permissible for the purposes of assessing liability, so long as any act contributing to that hostile environment takes place within the statutory period.\" <i>Id.</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2068. <i>See also id.</i> at 2074 (\"Provided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by the court for the purposes of determining liability.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p82\">\n      <span class=\"num\">82</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Inasmuch as under <i>Morgan</i> the entire period during which a victim is subjected to a hostile work environment now constitutes one \"unlawful employment practice,\" <i>Morgan</i> supplants our jurisprudence on the continuing violation doctrine in hostile work environment claims, making it no longer necessary to distinguish between systemic and serial violations. And because the hostile work environment created by Juhl extended into the statutory period &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> after February 24, 1998 &#8212; Crowley satisfied the standard <i>Morgan</i> set forth and therefore was able to pursue her hostile work environment claim based partially on events that occurred outside the limitations period.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>New Trial</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p83\">\n      <span class=\"num\">83</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean argues that in the event we do not grant it judgment as a matter of law, in the alternative we should reverse the district court's order denying it a new trial. L.L. Bean's bases for a new trial include juror bias, erroneous evidentiary rulings, and improper jury instructions. We reject L.L. Bean's request for a new trial, as none of its arguments has merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Juror Bias</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p84\">\n      <span class=\"num\">84</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean argues that it is entitled to a new trial because one of the jurors neglected to disclose her \"possible bias\" during <i>voir dire</i> by failing to reveal that she is a lawyer affiliated with the New England Research Institute who not only represented a female plaintiff in a sex discrimination suit in federal court, but also investigates and researches legal topics relating to women's health and quality of life issues. Crowley responds that L.L. Bean's charges of \"possible bias\" are purely speculative and that it has not even tried to demonstrate that the juror's background would have affected the outcome of the trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p85\">\n      <span class=\"num\">85</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To secure a new trial based on a juror's inaccurate answers during <i>voir dire,</i> \"a party must first demonstrate that a juror failed to answer honestly a material question on <i>voir dire,</i> and then further show that a correct response would have provided a valid basis for cause.\" <i>McDonough Power Equip.,</i> 464 U.S. at 556, 104 S.Ct. at 850. When seeking a new trial based on non-disclosure of information by a juror during <i>voir dire,</i> however, a party \"must do more than raise a speculative allegation that the juror's possible bias may have influenced the outcome of the trial.\" <i>Dall,</i> 970 F.2d at 969.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p86\">\n      <span class=\"num\">86</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean sets forth the following facts and assertions to support its argument that the juror failed to disclose her \"possible bias.\" Following the trial, the juror wrote a letter to the trial judge asking permission to speak with Crowley's attorney, explaining that she \"found the case to be most interesting, in particular because of my training as a psychologist and my interest as a research scientist.\" After the judge shared the letter with the parties, L.L. Bean discovered that the juror (1) worked for the New England Research Institute; (2) investigated and researched women's issues, including topics on women's health as well as child custody in battered-women cases; and (3) as a \"family lawyer,\" represented a woman in a federal sexual discrimination case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p87\">\n      <span class=\"num\">87</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the basis of the foregoing information, L.L. Bean contends that the juror was dishonest when she failed to disclose her background after the judge asked the prospective jurors during <i>voir dire</i> whether they knew \"of any reason whatever, whether I have asked you about it or not why you would have a concern about your ability to serve as a fair and impartial juror if you are selected in this case.\" Br. of Appellant at 42 (quoting Tr. of Voir Dire at 24). L.L. Bean insists that if the juror had disclosed her \"research interest in this case\" as well as her professional experience as an attorney in a sex discrimination case, it would have successfully challenged her for cause. <i>Id.</i> at 44.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p88\">\n      <span class=\"num\">88</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We reject L.L. Bean's argument for several reasons. First, notwithstanding its assertions to the contrary, it has not demonstrated that the juror was dishonest in response to the court's question. Although L.L. Bean may believe that the juror's background and experience would make her biased, it does not follow that she believed that she could not be a fair and impartial juror because of her experiences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p89\">\n      <span class=\"num\">89</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, L.L. Bean bases its charge of possible bias on its assumption that the juror is biased against all men and all employers because she researched women's issues and served as an attorney some years ago in a sexual discrimination suit. We agree with the district court in its assessment that \"[t]he suggestion that an interest in women's issues naturally correlates to a dislike for men and employers is\" unfounded.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p90\">\n      <span class=\"num\">90</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, L.L. Bean only speculates as to whether the juror actually is biased, for it has not \"demonstrate[d] actual prejudice or bias,\" <i>Dall,</i> 970 F.2d at 969, but only has alleged \"possible bias.\" Br. of Appellant at 41. As we have stated previously, the \"`burden of proof must be sustained not as a matter of speculation, but as a demonstrable reality.'\" <i>Dall,</i> 970 F.2d at 969 (quoting <i>United States v. Vargas,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"370275\"><a href=\"/opinion/370275/united-states-v-antonio-gaudino-vargas/\"><span class=\"volume\">606</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">341</span></a></span>, 344 (1st Cir.1979)). Therefore, because L.L. Bean has not met the standard for obtaining a new trial based on actual juror bias, we will affirm the district court's dismissal of its motion for new trial based on this ground.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Evidentiary Rulings</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p91\">\n      <span class=\"num\">91</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean contends that the district court made several erroneous evidentiary rulings that entitle it to a new trial. The district court, however, did not make an error of law or abuse its discretion in any of these rulings, and therefore, we reject L.L. Bean's request for new trial based on these grounds.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">a. <i>Team Leader Hearsay</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p92\">\n      <span class=\"num\">92</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean asserts that the district court erred when it allowed Crowley to introduce hearsay testimony that her team leader, Peter Farley, jokingly referred to Juhl as Crowley's \"little stalker\" after she reported an incident of harassment by Juhl in April 1998. L.L. Bean contends that the court improperly allowed the statement as an admission by a party-opponent under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2), arguing that team leaders are not authorized to speak on its behalf, and therefore, \"their statements cannot be considered within the scope of their agency as an employee of L.L. Bean.\" Br. of Appellant at 46.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p93\">\n      <span class=\"num\">93</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean's argument fails for two reasons. First, the court did not allow Crowley to introduce the statement as an admission by a party-opponent under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2). Rather, the court concluded that the statement did not constitute hearsay under Fed.R.Evid. 801(c) because it was not offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted. In other words, Crowley did not offer Farley's comments that Juhl is her \"little stalker\" to prove that Juhl is actually a stalker; she offered the statement to show that L.L. Bean management was aware of Juhl's behavior.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p94\">\n      <span class=\"num\">94</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even if the district court had admitted the statement as an admission by a party-opponent under Fed.R.Evid. 801(d)(2), we doubt that the court would have erred. Although L.L. Bean now maintains that team leaders are not supervisors and are not responsible for hiring, firing, or disciplining employees, L.L. Bean admitted at trial that team leaders are, in fact, supervisors. For instance, Human Resources manager Pat Bressette-Long testified that team leaders were part of L.L. Bean's \"leadership.\" Moreover, L.L. Bean's job descriptions state that team leaders are responsible for communicating and enforcing company policies, maintaining employee records, making recommendations on hiring, delivering disciplinary actions to employees, and handling personnel issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">b. <i>Inadmissible Lay Opinions</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p95\">\n      <span class=\"num\">95</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean next argues that the district court improperly allowed Crowley's witnesses to offer lay opinions by characterizing Juhl's conduct toward Crowley as \"stalking.\" L.L. Bean describes these comments as a \"drive-by character assassination.\" Br. of Appellant at 49.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p96\">\n      <span class=\"num\">96</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But Crowley's witnesses were not the only ones to use the term \"stalking.\" Human Resources manager Pat Bressette-Long and supervisor David Simmons used the term \"stalked\" in their notes from their meeting with Crowley after Juhl broke into her home. Moreover, even L.L. Bean's attorneys used the term \"stalked\" at trial, at one point asking Bressette-Long whether supervisor Tim Marong ever mentioned \"whether or not it was his conclusion that Ms. Crowley was being stalked or that is what [Crowley] had said to him.\" And in response, Bressette-Long stated that Crowley had, in fact, told Marong that she was being stalked. In the circumstances, we reject L.L. Bean's argument on this point.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">c. <i>Non-Workplace Conduct</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p97\">\n      <span class=\"num\">97</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean argues that the district court abused its discretion in denying its motion <i>in limine</i> to exclude evidence of Juhl's non-workplace conduct, such as Crowley's encounters with him at a bar and at the L.L. Bean Christmas party in 1996, his following her home one night in 1996, and his breaking into her home in February 1997.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> <i>See</i> Br. of Appellant at 51. L.L. Bean failed, however, to make a timely objection at trial to evidence relating to Juhl's non-workplace conduct. L.L. Bean only objected to \"time-barred\" evidence and actually stated to the district court that the jury \"may take into consideration conduct that occurred off premises in determining whether the conduct at work was hostile environment.\" Thus, L.L. Bean invited the ruling of which it now complains.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p98\">\n      <span class=\"num\">98</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Assuming arguendo that L.L. Bean had preserved its objection, the district court would not have erred in allowing evidence relating to non-workplace conduct. L.L. Bean opines that it cannot prevent and therefore should not be liable for an employee's off-site behavior. Consequently, L.L. Bean believes that any evidence of non-workplace conduct and interactions is irrelevant and should be precluded. Courts, however, do permit evidence of non-workplace conduct to help determine the severity and pervasiveness of the hostility in the workplace as well as to establish that the conduct was motivated by gender. For example, in <i>O'Rourke,</i> we affirmed a verdict in favor of a sexual harassment victim who had offered evidence that she had received crank phone calls at home. <i>See O'Rourke,</i> 235 F.3d at 724. In this case, Juhl's intimidating behavior and hostile interactions with Crowley outside of work help explain why she was so frightened of Juhl and why his constant presence around her at work created a hostile work environment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">d. <i>L.L Bean's Investigation</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p99\">\n      <span class=\"num\">99</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean contends that the district court improperly excluded as hearsay certain documents relating to its investigation of a confrontation between Crowley and Juhl on June 23, 1998. L.L. Bean asserts that a report prepared by team leader Leo Davis \"paints a very different picture [of Juhl] than the caricature presented by Crowley,\" and the court's exclusion of the report of the investigation \"significantly hamstrung [L.L. Bean] in presenting its defense.\" Br. of Appellant at 53.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p100\">\n      <span class=\"num\">100</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Aside from explaining how critical it believes that this report was to its defense, L.L. Bean does not indicate the reasons why the district court's exclusion of the documents was improper or the basis for admitting the documents. L.L. Bean mentions in its brief that Davis interviewed witnesses to the confrontation as well as Juhl and Crowley. If that is the case, L.L. Bean would have to overcome a double hearsay problem for the evidence to be admissible. <i>See United States v. Reilly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"677312\"><a href=\"/opinion/677312/united-states-v-william-p-reilly-united-states-of-america-v-john/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1396</span></a></span>, 1410 (3d Cir.1994). L.L. Bean does not, however, attempt to find exceptions to address the multiple layers of hearsay. Moreover, L.L. Bean does not explain why the information in the report could not have been elicited through direct testimony rather than through the hearsay document. Overall, we are satisfied that L.L. Bean has not demonstrated on appeal that the district court abused its discretion in disallowing the documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Jury Instructions</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p101\">\n      <span class=\"num\">101</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">L.L. Bean's last rationale for requesting a new trial is to claim that the district court provided flawed jury instructions. <i>See</i> Br. of Appellant at 55-60. It argues that the court gave erroneous instructions on the elements of a systemic violation by failing to make clear that Crowley had to prove that it maintained a discriminatory policy or practice relating to hiring, training, promotions, firing, and compensation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p102\">\n      <span class=\"num\">102</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if these jury instructions were flawed legally as L.L. Bean contends, we conclude that the error was harmless in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Morgan.</i> As we already explained above, <i>Morgan</i> eliminates the need for juries to determine whether there was a systemic or serial violation in order to invoke the continuing violations doctrine and thus to allow consideration of discriminatory acts that fell outside the limitations period. The Court explained in <i>Morgan</i> that \"[p]rovided that an act contributing to the claim occurs within the filing period, the entire time period of the hostile environment may be considered by the court for the purposes of determining liability.\" <i>Morgan,</i> 122 S.Ct. at 2074. Moreover, the asserted error would not have contributed to the jury's finding that the violation was ongoing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p103\">\n      <span class=\"num\">103</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, L.L. Bean argues that the district court erred by refusing to instruct the jury that it must determine whether a hostile work environment existed based on Juhl's behavior at work, not his non-workplace conduct. <i>See</i> Br. of Appellant at 56. As with L.L. Bean's challenge to the court's evidentiary ruling allowing evidence of Juhl's non-workplace conduct, Crowley maintains that L.L. Bean actually waived its objection by telling the district court that the jury could \"take into consideration conduct that occurred off premises in determining whether the conduct at work was hostile environment.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p104\">\n      <span class=\"num\">104</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not L.L. Bean waived its objection, it is inconceivable to us that the jury could have found L.L. Bean liable for maintaining a hostile work environment by disregarding the overwhelming amount of evidence of Juhl's harassment on L.L. Bean's premises and instead basing its verdict on the comparatively few incidents involving Juhl's non-workplace conduct. As such, we conclude that even if it would have been advisable to charge the jury as L.L. Bean had requested, the district court's refusal to do so did not affect L.L. Bean's \"substantial rights\" and therefore amounts to nothing more than harmless error under Fed.R.Civ.P. 61. <i>Cigna Ins. Co. v.

CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p105\">\n      <span class=\"num\">105</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the order of the district court denying L.L.

Hunterdon Developmental Ctr.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2365337\"><a href=\"/opinion/2365337/shepherd-v-hunterdon-devel-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.J.</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2365337\"><a href=\"/opinion/2365337/shepherd-v-hunterdon-devel-center/\"><span class=\"volume\">803</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">611</span></a></span>, 623 (2002). We make explicit under Title VII what the New Jersey court held implicitly under the similar New Jersey law.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> We are surprised that L.L. Bean was in the dark about the juror's background until she wrote her letter. In this regard, we point out that in its brief it cites three Maine Supreme Judicial Court cases in which it indicated that she \"acted as a family lawyer [representing] women in contested family disputes.\" Br. of Appellant at 43. All three cases resulted in published opinions in which her name appeared as an attorney. Moreover, the federal sex discrimination case produced a Westlaw opinion in which her name appears as an attorney</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> L.L. Bean also submits that the district court erred when it denied its motion to exclude evidence relating to Juhl's conduct prior to February 24, 1998<i>See</i> Br. of Appellant at 51. As discussed repeatedly throughout this opinion, however, the jury was permitted to consider this evidence and hold L.L. Bean liable for maintaining a hostile work environment prior to February 24, 1998, as long as the hostile work environment extended into the statutory period.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
