Un on brief for petitioner.\n     Brendan P. Hogan, Trial Attorney, Office of Immigration\nLitigation, Gregory G. Katsas, Acting Assistant Attorney General,\nCivil Division, and Michelle Gorden Latour, Assistant Director,\nOffice of Immigration Litigation, U.S. Department of Justice, on\nbrief for respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                       September 10, 2008\n\f          LYNCH, Chief Judge.     Tieng Sok, a native and citizen of\n\nCambodia, petitions for review of a decision by the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeals (\"BIA\") denying her application for asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (\"CAT\").   We deny the petition for review.\n\n                                  I.\n\n          Sok entered the United States on March 28, 2003, as a\n\nnon-immigrant visitor for pleasure.     She was authorized to remain\n\nin the United States through September 27, 2003, but overstayed.\n\nOn April 13, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security initiated\n\nremoval proceedings against Sok. Through counsel, Sok conceded her\n\nremovability, but applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nprotection under the CAT. A hearing was held before an Immigration\n\nJudge (\"IJ\") on March 17, 2006.\n\n          We recount her testimony, cutting to its essence.      Sok\n\ntestified that she was 52 years old, a widow with one child, and\n\nthat she had suffered persecution in Cambodia on account of her\n\npolitical activity.   She and her husband sold shoes in a market in\n\nPhnom Penh.   In 1995, she became involved with the Khmer Nation\n\nParty (\"KNP\"), campaigning and collecting donations on its behalf.\n\nA member of the rival Cambodian People's Party (\"CPP\") threatened\n\nher for this, saying that \"someday [her] life would be in danger.\"\n\n          In 1997, Sok and her husband fled from Phnom Penh during\n\na coup.   She testified that when they returned to the city, they\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\ffound their shop had been vandalized.      Sok believed this was in\n\nretaliation for supporting the KNP.1\n\n            Sok testified that in 1998 she became an active member of\n\nthe Sam Rainsy Party (\"SRP\"), which was challenging the CPP in an\n\nupcoming election.     After the CPP won the election, Sok and her\n\nhusband participated in a demonstration calling on Hun Sen, the\n\nCPP's leader, to step down.     Sok saw police beat and arrest her\n\nhusband.    She was struck with a rifle butt and fell to the ground,\n\nbut managed to escape and run home.\n\n            Some time after that, a government official came to Sok's\n\nhome and questioned her about her involvement in the protest.     He\n\ntold her she must cease her support for the SRP.          In another\n\nincident, Sok said she and her husband were followed by two men on\n\na motorcycle.    The men fired shots, but Sok and her husband managed\n\nto escape without injuries.\n\n            On November 17, 2002, Sok's husband was struck by a car\n\nand died.     A friend who witnessed the accident told her the car\n\nbelonged to the CPP and that it hit Sok's husband from behind.   Sok\n\nbelieved her husband was killed for being active in the SRP.     She\n\ntestified that twice thereafter she was threatened by police and\n\nwarned not to make any report or to blame the CPP for her husband's\n\ndeath.     Sok also said she fears if she returned to Cambodia, she\n\n\n     1\n          In the affidavit accompanying her asylum application, Sok\nstated that a security guard at the market told her \"this was a\nconsequence for anyone who was not a member of the CPP.\"\n\n                                 -3-\n\fwould   be   killed   because    of   her    connection    to   her    husband.\n\n             The IJ determined that Sok had not met her burden of\n\nproof required to establish eligibility for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, or protection under the CAT.           While he did not find Sok\n\nnon-credible, he characterized her testimony as \"lost,\" \"confused,\n\nsuperficial, hesitant and inconsistent.\"          Specifically, the IJ was\n\ntroubled by Sok's \"halting\" responses to questions about the\n\ndemonstration in which Sok and her husband were injured and Sok's\n\ninability to answer questions on this subject without prompting\n\nfrom her lawyer.      The IJ concluded that Sok \"simply did not know\n\nwhat the basis of her political asylum claim was until she was\n\nrefreshed.\"     Beyond this, he found the details surrounding the\n\ndeath of Sok's husband to be \"very flimsy, at best.\"                  It is not\n\nbelievable, he said, that the police would bring Sok in to tell her\n\n\"not to make a report with respect to an accident that she didn't\n\neven witness.\"\n\n             Even though he assumed that most of the events described\n\nby Sok took place, and examined Sok's testimony \"in the best\n\npossible light,\" the IJ concluded that Sok had failed to carry her\n\nburden of proof on any of her claims.         The IJ rejected Sok's claims\n\nand granted her voluntary departure.\n\n             The BIA rejected Sok's appeal on July 12, 2007. It noted\n\nthe \"numerous examples of . . . deficiencies\" identified by the IJ\n\nin   Sok's   testimony   and    determined    that   the   IJ   had    properly\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fconcluded that Sok failed to meet her burden of proof.                     The BIA\n\nstated that \"although testimony may in some cases be the only\n\nevidence available to prove an asylum applicant's claim, it must be\n\nbelievable, consistent, and sufficiently detailed.\"                    It concluded\n\nthat her testimony did not meet this standard.               Sok also argued to\n\nthe BIA that her due process rights were violated because purported\n\ntranslation problems during the hearing caused her testimony to\n\nappear deficient.       The BIA rejected this claim.              It pointed out\n\nthat Sok did not complain about the interpreter during the hearing\n\nand found that she had failed to show how any alleged inadequacies\n\nwould have affected the outcome of the proceedings. Sok petitioned\n\nthis court for review.\n\n                                        II.\n\n             Sok    argues    that   the    denial    of   her   claims    was    not\n\nsupported by substantial evidence and that translation problems in\n\nthe hearing before the IJ violated her right to due process.                     Both\n\narguments lack merit.\n\nA.           Substantial Evidence\n\n             We    review    the   BIA's   findings    under     the    deferential\n\nsubstantial evidence standard.             See, e.g., Kechichian v. Mukasey,\n\nNo. 07-1584, ___ F.3d ___, 2008 WL 2814789, at *3 (1st Cir. July\n\n23, 2008).    We uphold the BIA's findings if they are \"supported by\n\nreasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on the record\n\nconsidered as a whole.\"            Sharari v. Gonzáles, 407 F.3d 467, 473\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\f(1st Cir. 2005) (quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481\n\n(1992)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                  We reverse only if\n\n\"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); see also, e.g., Chikkeur v.\n\nMukasey, 514 F.3d 1381, 1382-83 (1st Cir. 2008).                  \"When the BIA\n\nadopts the IJ's opinion and discusses some of the bases for the\n\nIJ's decision, we have authority to review both the IJ's and the\n\nBIA's opinions.\"       Ouk v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 108, 110 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).    Here, the findings of the IJ, adopted by the BIA, are\n\nsupported by substantial evidence.\n\n              To qualify for asylum, an alien must demonstrate that she\n\n\"suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.\"        Chikkeur,     514    F.3d   at   1382    (citing    8   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(42)(A)).       The IJ determined that Sok had not met this\n\nburden in showing past persecution.              Sok established that she and\n\nher husband were beaten at a protest in 1998.                But this alone does\n\nnot rise to the level of persecution.                 See Palma-Mazariegos v.\n\nGonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 37 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[P]ersecution requires\n\nmore   than    a   showing   of   either   episodic     violence    or   sporadic\n\nabuse.\"); Nelson v. INS, 232 F.3d 258, 263-64 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"To\n\nqualify as persecution, a person's experience must rise above\n\nunpleasantness, harassment, and even basic suffering.\").                     As for\n\nthe death of Sok's husband, the BIA and IJ permissibly found the\n\nevidence presented by Sok was too vague to meet the burden of\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\fproof.   See Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 571 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).   They could reasonably conclude that even if the car that\n\nstruck Sok's husband had been owned by the CPP, this did not\n\nestablish that Sok's husband was purposefully killed for his\n\npolitical activity.2   The record does not compel a finding of past\n\npersecution.\n\n          Nor was it unreasonable for the IJ to conclude that Sok\n\nhad failed to prove a well-founded fear of future persecution. Sok\n\nclaimed she fears she would be killed if she returned to Cambodia.\n\nBut the record does not compel the conclusion that this fear is\n\nobjectively reasonable.      See Nelson, 232 F.3d at 264-65.   The\n\nevidence the government had targeted her husband was not strong --\n\nthe connection between the government and the death of Sok's\n\nhusband is far from clear.    The IJ could also reasonably conclude\n\nthat the government would be unlikely to take action six years\n\nlater against Sok.\n\n          Sok argues that the IJ failed to consider the evidence\n\nsubmitted on the nature of Cambodia's government in determining\n\nthat Sok lacked a well-founded fear of future persecution. But the\n\nIJ did not ignore this evidence.    He explicitly acknowledged \"the\n\nharshness of the government in Cambodia\" in his oral decision and\n\n\n\n     2\n          Similarly, absent more evidence the BIA and IJ were not\ncompelled to conclude that the incident involving the two men on\nthe motorcycle was connected to her political activity or to the\ngovernment.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fstated during the hearing that he had read and would consider the\n\nState Department Country Reports on Cambodia.      In his opinion, the\n\nIJ is not required to dissect every piece of evidence presented.\n\nSee Pulisir v. Mukasey, 524 F.3d 302, 310 (1st Cir. 2008); Pan v.\n\nGonzales, 489 F.3d 80, 87 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n          The   IJ    also   properly   rejected   Sok's    claims   for\n\nwithholding of removal and protection under the CAT. Sok failed to\n\nmeet the burden of proof required to establish an asylum claim and\n\ntherefore necessarily failed to meet the more stringent burden\n\nrequired for a withholding of removal.      See Makhoul v. Ashcroft,\n\n387 F.3d 75, 82 (1st Cir. 2004); Khalil v. Ashcroft, 337 F.3d 50,\n\n56 (1st Cir. 2003).     The CAT does not apply because Sok has not\n\nalleged that she has suffered any treatment that could constitute\n\ntorture, see 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a), nor has she established that it\n\nis more likely than not that she would be tortured if she returned\n\nto Cambodia, see 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2).\n\n          The BIA's denial of Sok's claims for relief was supported\n\nby substantial evidence.\n\nB.        Due Process\n\n          Sok argues that the BIA erred in rejecting her claim that\n\na poor translation during her hearing was what caused her testimony\n\nto sound halting and unbelievable and that the IJ's failure to take\n\nthis into account violated her due process rights.         This claim is\n\nweak, since no meaningful complaint about the interpreter was\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fraised during the hearing.3    See Gishta v. Gonzales, 404 F.3d 972,\n\n978 (6th Cir. 2005); see also Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 375\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).   Moreover, Sok has not shown she was prejudiced by\n\nthe alleged deficiency.   See Lattab v. Ashcroft, 384 F.3d 8, 20-21\n\n(1st Cir. 2004); see also Gishta, 404 F.3d at 979.   The halting and\n\nconfused nature of Sok's testimony gave the IJ pause as to the\n\nveracity of some of Sok's claims.       But he ultimately made his\n\ndetermination while considering the evidence \"in the best possible\n\nlight for [Sok].\"     Even assuming that most of the events Sok\n\ndescribed actually took place, the IJ concluded that Sok could not\n\nmeet her evidentiary burden.    Thus it is not clear how the alleged\n\ndeficiency could have affected the outcome of the proceedings. Sok\n\nreceived a full and fair hearing.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          At one point, Sok's counsel raised the general contention\nthat everything Sok said was filtered through translation, so it\nwas impossible to know the exact words she was using. But this is\nunrelated to the deficiencies in Sok's testimony discussed by the\nIJ -- namely its vagueness and Sok's failure to discuss major bases\nof her claim without prompting from counsel.\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

Sok claimed she fears she would be killed if she returned to Cambodia. But the record does not compel the conclusion that this fear is objectively reasonable. <i>See </i><i>Nelson,</i> 232 F.3d at 264-65. The evidence the government had targeted her husband was not strong  the connection between the government and the death of Sok's husband is far from clear. The IJ could also reasonably conclude that the government would be unlikely to take action six years later against Sok.</p>\n<p>Sok argues that the IJ failed to consider the evidence submitted on the nature of Cambodia's government in determining that Sok lacked a well-founded fear of future persecution. But the IJ did not ignore this evidence. He explicitly acknowledged \"the harshness of the government in Cambodia\" in his oral decision and stated during the hearing that he had read and would consider the State Department Country Reports on Cambodia. In his opinion, the IJ is not required to dissect every piece of evidence presented. <i>See </i><i>Pulisir v. Mukasey,</i> 524 F.3d 302, 310 (1st Cir.2008); <i>Pan v. Gonzales,</i> 489 F.3d 80, 87 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>The IJ also properly rejected Sok's claims for withholding of removal and protection under the CAT. Sok failed to meet the burden of proof required to establish an asylum claim and therefore necessarily failed to meet the more stringent burden required for a withholding of removal. <i>See </i><i>Makhoul v. Ashcroft,</i> 387 F.3d 75, 82 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Khalil v. Ashcroft,</i> 337 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir.2003). The CAT does not apply because Sok has not alleged that she has suffered any treatment that could constitute torture, <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. § 208.18(a), nor has she established that it is more likely than not that she would be tortured if she returned to Cambodia, <i>see</i> 8 C.F.R. § 1208.16(c)(2).</p>\n<p>The BIA's denial of Sok's claims for relief was supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>Due Process</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Sok argues that the BIA erred in rejecting her claim that a poor translation during her hearing was what caused her testimony to sound halting and unbelievable and that the IJ's failure to take this into account violated her due process rights. This claim is weak, since no meaningful complaint about the interpreter was raised during the hearing.<sup>[3]</sup><i>See </i><i>Gishta v. Gonzales,</i> 404 F.3d 972, 978 (6th Cir.2005); <i>see also </i><i>Albathani v. INS,</i> 318 F.3d 365, 375 (1st Cir.2003).

The halting and confused nature of Sok's testimony gave the IJ pause as to the veracity of some of Sok's claims. But he ultimately made his determination while considering the evidence \"in the best possible light for [Sok].\" Even assuming that most of the events Sok described actually took place, the IJ concluded that Sok could not meet her evidentiary burden. Thus it is not clear how the alleged deficiency could have affected <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> the outcome of the proceedings.

We deny the petition for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Sok entered the United States on March 28, 2003, as a non-immigrant visitor for pleasure. She was authorized to remain in the United States through September 27, 2003, but overstayed. On April 13, 2004, the Department of Homeland Security initiated removal proceedings against Sok. Through counsel, Sok conceded her removability, but applied for asylum, withholding of removal, and protection under the CAT. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*45</span> A hearing was held before an Immigration Judge (\"IJ\") on March 17, 2006.</p>\n<p>We recount her testimony, cutting to its essence. Sok testified that she was 52 years old, a widow with one child, and that she had suffered persecution in Cambodia on account of her political activity. She and her husband sold shoes in a market in Phnom Penh. In 1995, she became involved with the Khmer Nation Party (\"KNP\"), campaigning and collecting donations on its behalf. A member of the rival Cambodian People's Party (\"CPP\") threatened her for this, saying that \"someday [her] life would be in danger.\"</p>\n<p>In 1997, Sok and her husband fled from Phnom Penh during a coup. She testified that when they returned to the city, they found their shop had been vandalized. Sok believed this was in retaliation for supporting the KNP.<sup>[1]</sup></p>\n<p>Sok testified that in 1998 she became an active member of the Sam Rainsy Party (\"SRP\"), which was challenging the CPP in an upcoming election. After the CPP won the election, Sok and her husband participated in a demonstration calling on Hun Sen, the CPP's leader, to step down. Sok saw police beat and arrest her husband. She was struck with a rifle butt and fell to the ground, but managed to escape and run home.</p>\n<p>Some time after that, a government official came to Sok's home and questioned her about her involvement in the protest. He told her she must cease her support for the SRP. In another incident, Sok said she and her husband were followed by two men on a motorcycle. The men fired shots, but Sok and her husband managed to escape without injuries.</p>\n<p>On November 17, 2002, Sok's husband was struck by a car and died. A friend who witnessed the accident told her the car belonged to the CPP and that it hit Sok's husband from behind. Sok believed her husband was killed for being active in the SRP. She testified that twice thereafter she was threatened by police and warned not to make any report or to blame the CPP for her husband's death. Sok also said she fears if she returned to Cambodia, she would be killed because of her connection to her husband.</p>\n<p>The IJ determined that Sok had not met her burden of proof required to establish eligibility for asylum, withholding of removal, or protection under the CAT. While he did not find Sok non-credible, he characterized her testimony as \"lost,\" \"confused, superficial, hesitant and inconsistent.\" Specifically, the IJ was troubled by Sok's \"halting\" responses to questions about the demonstration in which Sok and her husband were injured and Sok's inability to answer questions on this subject without prompting from her lawyer. The IJ concluded that Sok \"simply did not know what the basis of her political asylum claim was until she was refreshed.\" Beyond this, he found the details surrounding the death of Sok's husband to be \"very flimsy, at best.\" It is not believable, he said, that the police would bring Sok in to tell her \"not to make a report with respect to an accident that she didn't even witness.\"</p>\n<p>Even though he assumed that most of the events described by Sok took place, and examined Sok's testimony \"in the best possible light,\" the IJ concluded that Sok had failed to carry her burden of proof on any of her claims. The IJ rejected Sok's <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> claims and granted her voluntary departure.</p>\n<p>The BIA rejected Sok's appeal on July 12, 2007. It noted the \"numerous examples of ... deficiencies\" identified by the IJ in Sok's testimony and determined that the IJ had properly concluded that Sok failed to meet her burden of proof. The BIA stated that \"although testimony may in some cases be the only evidence available to prove an asylum applicant's claim, it must be believable, consistent, and sufficiently detailed.\" It concluded that her testimony did not meet this standard. Sok also argued to the BIA that her due process rights were violated because purported translation problems during the hearing caused her testimony to appear deficient. The BIA rejected this claim. It pointed out that Sok did not complain about the interpreter during the hearing and found that she had failed to show how any alleged inadequacies would have affected the outcome of the proceedings. Sok petitioned this court for review.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>Sok argues that the denial of her claims was not supported by substantial evidence and that translation problems in the hearing before the IJ violated her right to due process. Both arguments lack merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Substantial Evidence</i>\n</h2>\n<p>We review the BIA's findings under the deferential substantial evidence standard. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Kechichian v. Mukasey,</i> No. 07-1584, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203402\"><a href=\"/opinion/203402/kechichian-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">535</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">15</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2008).

We reverse only if \"any reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the contrary.\" 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B); <i>see also, e.g., </i><i>Chikkeur v. Mukasey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203124\"><a href=\"/opinion/203124/chikkeur-v-mukasey/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1381</span></a></span>, 1382-83 (1st Cir.2008). \"When the BIA adopts the IJ's opinion and discusses some of the bases for the IJ's decision, we have authority to review both the IJ's and the BIA's opinions.\" <i>Ouk v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202443\"><a href=\"/opinion/202443/ouk-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">108</span></a></span>, 110 (1st Cir.2006). Here, the findings of the IJ, adopted by the BIA, are supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n<p>To qualify for asylum, an alien must demonstrate that she \"suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution.\" <i>Chikkeur,</i> 514 F.3d at 1382 (citing 8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A)). The IJ determined that Sok had not met this burden in showing past persecution. Sok established that she and her husband were beaten at a protest in 1998. But this alone does not rise to the level of persecution. <i>See </i><i>Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201897\"><a href=\"/opinion/201897/palma-mazariegos-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.2005) (\"[P]ersecution requires more than a showing of either episodic violence or sporadic abuse.\"); <i>Nelson v.

As for the death of Sok's husband, the BIA and IJ permissibly found the evidence presented by Sok was too vague to meet the burden of proof. <i>See </i><i>Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 571 (1st Cir.1999).
