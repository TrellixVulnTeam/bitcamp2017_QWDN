Reginald C. Lindsay, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                  Torruella, Boudin and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Dr. Alexander Jourjine on brief pro se.\n     Joseph L. Kociubes, Jonathan M. Albano, Jason L. Watkins,\nFrancesca L. Miceli and Bingham McCutchen LLP, on brief for\nappellees.\n\n\n\n                             March 6, 2009\n\f           Per Curiam.     Alexander Jourjine filed suit against Nokia\n\nCorp.,   Nokia,   Inc.,    and   Nokia   Svenska    AB   for    defamation    and\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress.              Nokia Corp. is a\n\nFinnish corporation (hereinafter \"Nokia Finland\").               Nokia, Inc. is\n\na U.S. corporation incorporated in Delaware with a principal place\n\nof business in Dallas, Texas (hereinafter \"Nokia U.S.\").                  Nokia\n\nSvenska AB is a Swedish corporation (hereinafter \"Nokia Sweden\").\n\nNokia U.S. and Nokia Sweden are each subsidiaries of Nokia Finland,\n\nthe parent corporation.\n\n           Before trial, Nokia Sweden was dismissed for lack of in\n\npersonam jurisdiction.       At the close of the evidence, the court\n\ngranted Nokia U.S.'s request for judgment as a matter of law on the\n\nclaim against it for intentional infliction of emotional distress.1\n\nThe remaining claims went to the jury.\n\n           The    jury    rejected   the   one     remaining     claim   --   the\n\ndefamation claim -- against Nokia U.S.                It also rejected the\n\nintentional infliction of emotional distress claim against Nokia\n\nFinland.   As for the defamation claim, the jury found that Nokia\n\nFinland had negligently published one or more false and defamatory\n\nstatements of and concerning Jourjine that were not privileged (or,\n\nif privileged, the privilege was abused), but that the publication\n\ndid not cause Jourjine to suffer any injury.                   Accordingly, the\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Jourjine makes no developed argument directed at this ruling.\nWe deem any argument waived. United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1,\n17 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\fcourt entered a judgment in favor of the defendants.        Jourjine has\n\nappealed.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            Jourjine challenges the district court's dismissal of\n\nNokia Sweden for lack of in personam jurisdiction.          The district\n\ncourt concluded that Jourjine had failed to demonstrate that the\n\ncourt had specific jurisdiction over Nokia Sweden.2        We review, de\n\nnovo, the district court's decision.         Harlow v. Children's Hosp.,\n\n432 F.3d 50, 57 (1st Cir. 2005).         Upon de novo review, we agree\n\nwith the district court.       Jourjine failed to show any in-forum\n\nactivity by Nokia Sweden, much less contacts that were related to\n\nJourjine's   claims   of   defamation   or   intentional   infliction   of\n\nemotional distress.\n\n                                  II.\n\n            Jourjine contends that the jury instruction improperly\n\nprecluded a finding of defamation per se.           He suggests that a\n\ncorrect instruction on defamation per se would have required the\n\njury not only to determine whether the defendant \"was negligent in\n\nascertaining whether the statement was true or false\" but also\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Although Jourjine also argues that the district court had\ngeneral jurisdiction over Nokia Sweden, the district court\nconcluded that Jourjine had only argued specific jurisdiction,\nmaking but a passing reference to general jurisdiction in a\nfootnote to his memorandum. Jourjine has ignored this district\ncourt finding of an effective waiver.\n\n                                 - 3 -\n\fwhether the defendant was negligent in ascertaining whether the\n\nstatement was defamatory.\n\n              We need not decide whether Jourjine's present contention\n\nhas any merit.3      It is clear that this contention was affirmatively\n\nwaived   at    the   charge   conference      where   counsel   conceded     that\n\nJourjine's     claim    was   that,   if   there   was   negligence,    it    was\n\nnegligence in determining whether the statements were true or false\n\nand that, because he claimed it was defamatory per se, he was not\n\nclaiming the defendants were negligent in determining whether it\n\nwas defamatory.        Tr. 9/18/2007 at pp. 67-68.4\n\n              On appeal, Jourjine contends that, because the jury found\n\nthat Nokia Finland had defamed him, he was entitled to nominal\n\ndamages.      Jourjine, however, never requested an instruction on\n\nnominal damages and did not object either to the district court's\n\nfailure to instruct on nominal damages or the verdict form which\n\ndid not provide for assessment of nominal damages.              This claim is,\n\ntherefore, forfeit and the plain error standard applies.               Jourjine\n\nmakes no plain error argument.             In any event, we find no plain\n\nerror.   See Acevedo-Luis v. Pagan, 478 F.3d 35, 39 & n.3 (1st Cir.\n\n\n     3\n      And, in view of the fact that the jury did find one or more\nof the statements defamatory, Jourjine's present complaint that the\njury instruction precluded a finding of defamation per se is\nsomewhat puzzling.\n     4\n      We also reject Jourjine's contention that the jury\ninstructions excluded any possibility of finding malice. Jourjine\ndid not object to the court's instruction and his argument does not\ndemonstrate plain error by the court.\n\n                                      - 4 -\n\f2007) (finding no plain error in failing to issue a nominal damages\n\ninstruction); see also Lakian v. Globe Newspaper Co., 399 Mass.\n\n379, 383-84, 504 N.E.2d 1046, 1048-49, (1987) (holding that the\n\nfailure to award nominal damages is not reversible error when\n\nplaintiff did not object to the verdict form nor the absence of a\n\njury question directly related to nominal damages).5\n\n                               III.\n\n          Jourjine argues the merits of a postjudgment motion that\n\nhe filed in the district court pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 60(b).\n\nHowever, the denial of such a Rule 60(b) motion is not encompassed\n\nwithin an earlier-filed appeal of the underlying judgment.      It\n\nrequires a separately-filed notice of appeal.   Williams v. Chater,\n\n\n\n     5\n      Jourjine suggests that counsel objected after the verdict was\nrendered. The objection, however, was not specifically directed at\nthe court's failure to instruct on nominal damages.         Rather,\ncounsel argued that the jury, having found the statement to be\ndefamatory, was required to find damages. The court responded that\nthe jury could find the action wrongful but that Jourjine had\nsuffered no injury or, if Jourjine had suffered injury, he had not\ndemonstrated that the injury had been caused by the defamation.\nEven assuming that counsel's post-verdict position is correct,\ni.e., that a jury having found defamation is required to find\ndamages, counsel, nonetheless, did not request such an instruction,\ndid not object to the court's failure to give such an instruction,\nand did not object to the verdict form which did not provide for\nsuch a finding. We would find no plain error.\n     Jourjine makes a passing complaint that the district court\nfailed to mention \"special damages.\"      Under Massachusetts law,\nhowever, \"special damages\" refers to economic loss, Ravnikar v.\nBogojavlensky, 438 Mass. 627, 630, 782 N.E.2d 508, 511 (2003), and\nthe district court instructed on the recovery of compensatory\ndamages for economic loss.        The court's use of the term\n\"compensatory\" instead of \"special\", to which Jourjine did not\nobject, was not error.\n\n                              - 5 -\n\f87 F.3d 702, 705 (5th Cir. 1996); Goffman v. Gross, 59 F.3d 668,\n\n673 (7th Cir. 1995); Karras v. Karras, 16 F.3d 245, 247 (8th Cir.\n\n1994); see also Puerto Rico v. SS Zoe Colocotroni, 601 F.2d 39, 42\n\n(1st Cir. 1979) (noting that if the Rule 60(b) motion is denied by\n\nthe district court and the denial appealed, we will entertain a\n\nrequest to consolidate the Rule 60(b) appeal with the pending\n\nappeal from the final judgment where feasible) (emphasis added).\n\n          Jourjine failed to file a notice of appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's denial of his Rule 60(b) motion. Accordingly, the\n\narguments directed at the Rule 60(b) motion are not properly before\n\nus and we will not address them.\n\n                                 IV.\n\n          Jourjine argues that he should be permitted to raise new\n\nclaims in his appellate brief.     There is no basis for permitting\n\nthe raising of new claims.\n\n          The judgment of the district court entered on September\n\n20, 2007 is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              - 6 -\n\f",
