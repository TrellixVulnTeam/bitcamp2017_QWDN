Smith, Attorney, Office of Immigration Litigation,\nCivil Division, with whom Peter D. Keisler, Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, and Terri J.

An immigration judge (IJ) denied Yve Sumaya\n\nAmparo de Ocasio's petition for permanent resident status and\ngranted her request for voluntary departure after concluding that\n\nher marriage to Willy Ocasio was a sham.        The Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (BIA) affirmed. The petitioner contests the BIA's decision\nbecause Willy Ocasio's testimony was submitted by affidavit, and\n\nshe therefore did not have the opportunity to cross-examine him.\n\nWe affirm.\n\n           The petitioner, a citizen of the Dominican Republic,\n\nmarried Willy Ocasio, a United States citizen, in December 1993.\n\nIn March 1995, based on this marriage, the petitioner was lawfully\n\nadmitted   to   the   United   States   for   permanent   residence   on   a\n\nconditional basis.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1186(a)(1).         As part of the\n\nprocess for adjusting the petitioner's status from conditional to\n\nfull, permanent status, the petitioner and Ocasio appeared for an\n\ninterview before an Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)\n\nofficer in May 1997.1     See 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(1)(B).\n\n             At the interview, the petitioner testified that she and\nOcasio were living together as husband and wife.          Ocasio, however,\n\nstated that the marriage was a sham and that he had married the\n\npetitioner as a favor to the petitioner's brother and in exchange\n\nfor $2,000. Ocasio thereafter submitted an affidavit memorializing\n\n\n     1\n       On March 1, 2003, the INS ceased to exist as an agency\nwithin the Department of Justice. Its enforcement functions were\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security. See Homeland\nSecurity Act of 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135 (2002).\nBecause the events at issue here predate that reorganization, we\nrefer to the INS in this opinion.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fthis testimony.     Based on the interview and affidavit, the INS\n\nrevoked the petitioner's conditional status and charged her as a\n\nremovable alien.\n            Around the time of the INS's decision, the petitioner\n\nfiled for a divorce from Ocasio in Rhode Island state court.2       As\n\na result, the petitioner filed an application for a hardship waiver\n\npursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(4).         Under this section, an\n\nimmigrant spouse may receive permanent resident status, despite the\n\nbreakup of her marriage, if the spouse can establish, inter alia,\n\nthat she \"entered into [the    marriage] in good faith . . . .\"    Id.\nat § 1186a(c)(4)(B).     The INS examined the petitioner concerning\n\nthe breakup of her marriage and denied the hardship waiver because\nthe petitioner had presented false testimony concerning the bona\nfides of her marriage.\n\n            The petitioner then sought de novo review by an IJ of her\n\nrequest for a hardship waiver.    See 8 U.S.C. § 1186a(c)(3)(D).   At\nher May 17, 1999 hearing before the IJ, the petitioner claimed that\n\nthe INS had erred in concluding that she did not enter into the\nmarriage in good faith. The petitioner testified on her own behalf\nand presented documentary evidence, including her marriage license,\n\na birth certificate, tax returns, a marriage certificate, a joint\n\nbank account statement, utility and telephone bills, and the\n\ndivorce decree.     The INS responded by attempting to introduce\n\nOcasio's affidavit, but the petitioner objected because Ocasio was\n\nnot present to testify.   The IJ agreed that the affidavit could not\n\n     2\n         The petitioner's divorce became final on February 16, 1998.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fbe admitted until efforts were made to produce Ocasio.                     The IJ\n\nadjourned the proceedings until October 27, 1999.\n\n            On   June    4,   1999,   the    INS   issued   Ocasio    a   subpoena\ndirecting him to appear at the October 27th hearing.                 The subpoena\n\nwas successfully served on Ocasio by registered mail five days\n\nlater.   Ocasio, however, did not appear for the hearing.                  The INS\n\nattorney reported to the IJ that Ocasio's lawyer had told him that\n\nhe doubted that Ocasio \"would come because he thought he might have\n\npotential . . . criminal involvement if he were to come here and\n\ntestify.\"    The IJ then adjourned the hearing until May 3, 2000.\n\n            On April 18, 2000, the INS filed a motion with the IJ\n\nasking him to seek the United States District Court's assistance in\nproducing Ocasio to testify.          See 8 C.F.R. § 287.4(d) (authorizing\n\nIJ to request that the United States District Court issue an order\n\nrequiring a recalcitrant witness to comply with an immigration\ncourt subpoena).        Because of counsel's unavailability for the May\n3rd hearing, the proceeding was delayed until March 2, 2001.\n\n            Ocasio did not appear for the March 2nd hearing.                 As a\nsubstitute, the INS introduced authentication testimony from an INS\nofficer who was present when Ocasio signed the affidavit.                   After\n\nthe officer's testimony, the IJ admitted the affidavit.                       The\n\npetitioner did not object.\n\n            After admitting the affidavit, the IJ closed the hearing.\n\nHe then issued an oral decision rejecting the petitioner's request\n\nfor a hardship waiver and granting her request for voluntary\n\ndeparture to the Dominican Republic.               The petitioner appealed to\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fthe BIA on the ground that the Ocasio affidavit should not have\n\nbeen admitted into evidence. The BIA affirmed, concluding that the\n\nINS \"made attempts to compel [Ocasio's] presence for the hearing.\"\n          The only contested issue before us is whether the BIA\n\nacted within its authority in sustaining the IJ's admission of the\n\nOcasio affidavit.   The petitioner claims that the affidavit should\n\nhave been excluded because its admission made the proceeding\n\nfundamentally unfair.    We review this claim de novo.       See Aguilar-\n\nSolis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 568 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          \"The Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in INS\n\nproceedings, Henry v. INS, 74 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1996), but the\nless rigid constraints of due process impose outer limits based\nupon considerations of fairness and reliability.\"           Yongo v. INS,\n\n355 F.3d 27, 30 (1st Cir. 2004).     One of these outer limits is that\n\nthe INS may not use an affidavit from an absent witness \"unless the\nINS first establishes that, despite reasonable efforts, it was\nunable to secure the presence of the witness at the hearing.\"\n\nOlabanji v. INS, 973 F.2d 1232, 1234 (5th Cir. 1992) (quoting\n\nHernandez-Garcia v. INS, 882 F.2d 945, 948 (5th Cir. 1989); see\n\nSaidane v. INS, 129 F.3d 1063, 1065 (9th Cir. 1997); Dallo v. INS,\n\n765 F.2d 581, 586 (6th Cir. 1985).\n\n          The petitioner claims that the INS did not use adequate\n\nmeasures to   compel    Ocasio's   attendance   at   her   hearing.   The\n\npetitioner's argument suffers from a fatal threshold defect: she\n\nfailed to make this argument to the IJ or even object to the\n\nadmission of the affidavit.    Under the circumstances, the IJ would\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fhave been warranted to conclude that petitioner's counsel agreed\n\nthat, by the time of the March 2001 hearing, the INS had satisfied\n\nits obligation to make reasonable efforts to secure Ocasio's\npresence at the hearing.\n\n             An alien who does not object to the admissibility of\n\nevidence at her deportation proceeding forfeits any objection to\n\nthe admission of that evidence.            See Matter of Edwards, 20 I & N\n\nDec. 191, 199 n.4 (BIA 1990) (\"Because the respondent did not\n\nobject to the entry of this document into evidence at the hearing\n\nbelow, it is not appropriate for him to object on appeal.\"); see\nalso Ayyoub v. INS, 93 Fed. Appx. 828, 834 (6th Cir. 2004)\n\n(unpublished disposition) (rejecting similar claim because of the\npetitioner's failure to object to the affidavit's admission);\nFisher v. INS, 79 F.3d 955, 965 (9th Cir. 1996) (faulting alien's\n\ncounsel for failing to object to admission of affidavit of absent\ndeclarant). Because the petitioner's claim fails on this basis, we\ndo not reach her arguments regarding the fundamental fairness of\n\nthe IJ's reliance on Ocasio's affidavit.\n             The petitioner asks alternatively that we reinstate her\nvoluntary departure status and in its brief the INS stated its\n\nnonopposition to the request. We therefore reinstate the voluntary\n\ndeparture period granted by the BIA.\n\n             The petition for review is denied, the decision of the\n\nBoard   of   Immigration   Appeals    is    affirmed,   and   the   voluntary\n\ndeparture period is reinstated.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f",

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner, a citizen of the Dominican Republic, married Willy Ocasio, a United States citizen, in December 1993. In March 1995, based on this marriage, the petitioner was lawfully admitted to the United States for permanent residence on a conditional basis. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186(a)(1). As part of the process for adjusting the petitioner's status from conditional to full, permanent status, the petitioner and Ocasio appeared for an interview before an Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) officer in May 1997.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(1)(B).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the interview, the petitioner testified that she and Ocasio were living together as husband and wife. Ocasio, however, stated that the marriage was a sham and that he had married the petitioner as a favor to the petitioner's brother and in exchange for $2,000. Ocasio thereafter submitted an affidavit memorializing this testimony. Based on the interview and affidavit, the INS revoked the petitioner's conditional status and charged her as a removable alien.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Around the time of the INS's decision, the petitioner filed for a divorce from Ocasio in Rhode Island state court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> As a result, the petitioner filed an application for a hardship waiver pursuant to 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(4). Under this section, an immigrant spouse may receive permanent resident status, despite the breakup of her marriage, if the spouse can establish, <i>inter alia,</i> that she \"entered into [the marriage] in good faith....\" <i>Id.</i> at &#167; 1186a(c)(4)(B). The INS examined the petitioner concerning the breakup of her marriage and denied the hardship waiver because the petitioner had presented false testimony concerning the bona fides of her marriage.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioner then sought <i>de novo</i> review by an IJ of her request for a hardship waiver. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1186a(c)(3)(D). At her May 17, 1999 hearing before the IJ, the petitioner claimed that the INS had erred in concluding that she did not enter into the marriage in good faith. The petitioner testified on her own behalf and presented documentary evidence, including her marriage license, a birth certificate, tax returns, a marriage certificate, a joint bank account statement, utility and telephone bills, and the divorce decree. The INS responded by attempting to introduce Ocasio's affidavit, but the petitioner objected because Ocasio was not present to testify. The IJ agreed that the affidavit could not be admitted until efforts were made to produce Ocasio. The IJ adjourned the proceedings until October 27, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 4, 1999, the INS issued Ocasio a subpoena directing him to appear at the October 27th hearing. The subpoena was successfully served on Ocasio by registered mail five days later. Ocasio, however, did not appear for the hearing. The INS attorney reported to the IJ that Ocasio's lawyer had told him that he doubted that Ocasio \"would come because he thought he might have potential ... criminal involvement if he were to come here and testify.\" The IJ then adjourned the hearing until May 3, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 18, 2000, the INS filed a motion with the IJ asking him to seek the United States District Court's assistance in producing Ocasio to testify. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 287.4(d) (authorizing IJ to request that the United States District Court issue an order requiring a recalcitrant witness to comply with an immigration court subpoena). Because of counsel's unavailability for the May 3rd hearing, the proceeding was delayed until March 2, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ocasio did not appear for the March 2nd hearing. As a substitute, the INS introduced authentication testimony from an INS officer who was present when Ocasio signed the affidavit. After the officer's testimony, the IJ admitted the affidavit. The petitioner did not object.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After admitting the affidavit, the IJ closed the hearing. He then issued an oral decision rejecting the petitioner's request for a hardship waiver and granting her request for voluntary departure to the Dominican Republic. The petitioner appealed to the BIA on the ground that the Ocasio affidavit should not have been admitted into evidence. The BIA affirmed, concluding that the INS \"made attempts to compel [Ocasio's] presence for the hearing.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only contested issue before us is whether the BIA acted within its authority in sustaining the IJ's admission of the Ocasio affidavit. The petitioner claims that the affidavit should have been excluded because its admission made the proceeding fundamentally unfair. We review this claim <i>de novo. See Aguilar-Solis v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span>, 568 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"The Federal Rules of Evidence do not apply in INS proceedings, <i>Henry v.

The petitioner's argument suffers from a fatal threshold defect: she failed to make this argument to the IJ or even object to the admission of the affidavit. Under the circumstances, the IJ would have been warranted to conclude that petitioner's counsel agreed that, by the time of the March 2001 hearing, the INS had satisfied its obligation to make reasonable efforts to secure Ocasio's presence at the hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An alien who does not object to the admissibility of evidence at her deportation proceeding forfeits any objection to the admission of that evidence. <i>See Matter of Edwards,</i> 20 I &amp; N Dec. 191, 199 n. 4 (BIA 1990) (\"Because the respondent did not object to the entry of this document into evidence at the hearing below, it is not appropriate for him to object on appeal.\"); <i>see also Ayyoub v.
