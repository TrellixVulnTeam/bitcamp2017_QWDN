Jay A. García-Gregory, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                 Torruella, Lipez, and Howard,\n                        Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Gina Ismalia Gutiérrez-Galang, with whom Law Offices of\nPedro E. Ortiz-Álvarez, PSC, was on brief, for appellants.\n     Pablo R.

Defendants     appeal       from\n\ninterlocutory judgments denying their motions to dismiss for lack\n\nof jurisdiction.      The district court certified for interlocutory\n\nappeal, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b), the issue of whether the\n\nWorkforce Investment Act (\"WIA\"), 29 U.S.C. §§ 2801-2945, requires\n\nplaintiffs to exhaust administrative remedies before bringing a\n\nclaim under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for violation of their First Amendment\n\nrights.   Since we see no reason to depart from our general rule\n\nprohibiting interlocutory appeals from the denial of a motion to\n\ndismiss, we vacate the order allowing the interlocutory appeal as\n\nimprovidently granted.\n\n                                  I.   Background\n\n          Defendants     in    this     case   are   non-profit     partnerships\n\nbetween   neighboring        municipalities        in    Puerto     Rico;    these\n\npartnerships -- or consortiums, as they are termed -- are overseen\n\nby the municipalities' mayors and administered by various executive\n\nofficers, all of whom are also defendants. The consortiums operate\n\nunder WIA, the purpose of which is \"to provide workforce investment\n\nactivities,   through    statewide       and     local   workforce    investment\n\nsystems, that increase the employment, retention, and earnings of\n\nparticipants,   and     increase       occupational      skill    attainment       by\n\nparticipants,   and,    as    a    result,     improve   the     quality    of    the\n\nworkforce [and] reduce welfare dependency.\" 29 U.S.C. § 2811. The\n\nconsortiums employ administrative staff (\"plaintiffs\") on a one-\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fyear   contract    basis   to   provide   services   to   WIA   program\n\nbeneficiaries.\n\n          As a result of the November 7, 2000 general election, the\n\nconsortiums underwent a shift in political power, from the New\n\nProgressive Party (\"NPP\") to the Popular Democratic Party (\"PDP\").\n\nFollowing these events, defendants discharged plaintiffs' contracts\n\nwith the consortiums.\n\n             Plaintiffs subsequently sued under § 1983, the First and\n\nFourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution, and Puerto Rico\n\nlaw, alleging that political discrimination spurred these personnel\n\ndecisions.    Defendants moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter\n\njurisdiction, arguing that WIA precludes § 1983 claims because WIA\n\nprovides the exclusive administrative procedure for discrimination\n\nclaims.\n\n             The court denied defendants' motions to dismiss, holding\n\nthat Congress did not expressly or implicitly intend to foreclose\n\n§ 1983 claims under WIA.    Caraballo-Seda v. Rivera, 306 F. Supp. 2d\n\n108 (D.P.R. 2004); see also Delgado-Greo v. Trujillo, 270 F. Supp.\n\n2d 189 (D.P.R. 2003).1      The court, however, granted defendants'\n\nmotion for certification of interlocutory appeal pursuant to 28\n\nU.S.C. § 1292(b) on this determination.      The court's order stated\n\n\n\n1\n   Two other district courts in Puerto Rico arrived at similar\nholdings. See Borrero-Rodríguez v. Montalvo-Vázquez, 275 F. Supp.\n2d 127 (D.P.R. 2003); Torres Ramos v. Consorcio de la Montaña, 286\nF. Supp. 2d 126 (D.P.R. 2003).\n\n                                  -3-\n\fthat this issue \"involves a question of law as to which there is\n\nsubstantial   ground   for   difference   of    opinion,\"   and   that   an\n\nimmediate appeal \"may materially advance the ultimate determination\n\nof the litigation.\"     This Court granted defendants' petition to\n\nhear the discretionary appeal on November 18, 2003, and for the\n\nreasons set forth below, we vacate that order.\n\n                             II.   Analysis\n\n          Interlocutory appeals under § 1292(b) require an order\n\n(1) \"involv[ing] a controlling question of law,\" (2) \"as to which\n\nthere is substantial ground for difference of opinion,\" and (3) for\n\nwhich \"an immediate appeal from the order may materially advance\n\nthe ultimate termination of the litigation.\"        28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).\n\nWe have repeatedly emphasized that \"interlocutory certification\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1292(b) should be used sparingly and only in\n\nexceptional circumstances, and where the proposed intermediate\n\nappeal presents one or more difficult and pivotal questions of law\n\nnot settled by controlling authority.\"        Palandjian v. Pahlavi, 782\n\nF.2d 313, 314 (1st Cir. 1986) (quoting McGillicuddy v. Clements,\n\n746 F.2d 76 n.1 (1st Cir. 1984) (citing In re Heddendorf, 263 F.2d\n\n887, 888-89 (1st Cir. 1959))).\n\n          As a general rule, we do not grant interlocutory appeals\n\nfrom a denial of a motion to dismiss.     McGillicuddy, 746 F.2d at 76\n\nn.1.   In McGillicuddy, a case involving a denial of a motion to\n\ndismiss a multi-count complaint, we held that the district court\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fshould not have considered the interlocutory appeal in the first\n\nplace: \"[w]e would not normally allow an appeal from a denial of a\n\nmotion to dismiss, and, with the benefit of hindsight, we admit our\n\nerror in doing so in this case.\"           Id.     This reflects our policy\n\npreference against piecemeal litigation, see Heddendorf, 263 F.2d\n\nat 889, as well as prudential concerns about mootness, ripeness,\n\nand   lengthy    appellate     proceedings.         Thus,     the   \"fact   that\n\nappreciable     trial   time   may   be    saved   is   not    determinative,\"\n\nPalandjian, 782 F.2d at 314, and neither is the fact that the case\n\nhas \"tremendous implications\" or \"might materially advance the\n\nultimate termination of the litigation,\" Slade v. Shearson, Hammill\n\n& Co., Inc., 517 F.2d 398, 400 (2d Cir. 1974).\n\n          In the instant case, we see no reason to depart from our\n\ngeneral rule prohibiting interlocutory appeals from the denial of\n\na motion to dismiss.      Although the issue of whether WIA expressly\n\nor implicitly forecloses § 1983 suits is a \"controlling question of\n\nlaw,\" it has not met the other two factors of § 1292(b).               The fact\n\nthat two other district courts in Puerto Rico have arrived at a\n\nsimilar holding regarding WIA's non-preclusive effect on § 1983\n\nclaims, see Borrero-Rodríguez v. Montalvo-Vázquez, 275 F. Supp. 2d\n\n127 (D.P.R. 2003); Torres Ramos v. Consorcio de la Montaña, 286 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 126 (D.P.R. 2003), supports a finding that no \"substantial\n\nground for difference of opinion\" exists.               28 U.S.C. § 1292(b).\n\nMoreover, since the rest of the claims based on the same underlying\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\ffacts have proceeded in the district court, the interlocutory\n\nappeal on the WIA issue does not \"materially advance the ultimate\n\ntermination of the litigation.\"       Id.   Finally, we emphasize that\n\ninterlocutory appeals are granted at our \"discretion,\" id. (\"The\n\nCourt of Appeals which would have jurisdiction of an appeal of such\n\naction may thereupon, in its discretion, permit an appeal to be\n\ntaken from such order\") (emphasis added), and \"with the benefit of\n\nhindsight, we admit our error in doing so in this case,\" cf.\n\nMcGillicuddy, 746 F.2d at 76, n.1.\n\n          Thus,   we   vacate   the    initial   order   granting   the\n\ninterlocutory appeal as improvidently granted, and remand the issue\n\nto the district court for adjudication.\n\n          Vacated and Remanded.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f",

We have repeatedly emphasized that \"interlocutory certification under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1292(b) should be used sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances, and where the proposed intermediate appeal presents one or more difficult and pivotal questions of law not settled by controlling authority.\" <i>Palandjian v.

In <i>McGillicuddy,</i> a case involving a denial of a motion to dismiss a multi-count complaint, we held that the district court should not have considered the interlocutory appeal in the first place: \"[w]e would not normally allow an appeal from a denial of a motion to dismiss, and, with the benefit of hindsight, we admit our error in doing so in this case.\" <i>Id.</i> This reflects our policy preference against piecemeal litigation, <i>see Heddendorf,</i> 263 F.2d at 889, as well as prudential concerns about mootness, ripeness, and lengthy appellate proceedings. Thus, the \"fact that appreciable trial time may be saved is not determinative,\" <i>Palandjian,</i> 782 F.2d at 314, and neither is the fact that the case has \"tremendous implications\" or \"might materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation,\" <i>Slade v.

Although the issue of whether WIA expressly or implicitly forecloses &#167; 1983 suits is a \"controlling question of law,\" it has not met the other two factors of &#167; 1292(b). The fact that two other district courts in Puerto Rico have arrived at a similar holding regarding WIA's non-preclusive effect on &#167; 1983 claims, <i>see Borrero-Rodr&#237;guez v.

Moreover, since the rest of the claims based on the same underlying facts have proceeded in the district court, the interlocutory appeal on the WIA issue does not \"materially advance the ultimate termination of the litigation.\" <i>Id.</i> Finally, we emphasize that interlocutory appeals are granted at our \"discretion,\" <i>id.</i> (\"The Court of Appeals which would have jurisdiction of an appeal of such action may thereupon, in its <i>discretion,</i> permit an appeal to be taken from such order\") (emphasis added), and \"with the benefit of hindsight, we admit our error in doing so in this case,\" <i>cf.
