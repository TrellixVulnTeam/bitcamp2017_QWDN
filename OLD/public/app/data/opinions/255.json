BENDER, Commissioner of Correction,\n\n                          Respondent.\n\n\n          APPLICATION FOR PERMISSION TO FILE A SECOND\n              OR SUCCESSIVE HABEAS CORPUS PETITION\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                  Torruella, Boudin and Lipez,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     William Restucci pro se.\n     Carmen Ortiz, United States Attorney,       and    Annette   C.\nBenedetto, Assistant United States Attorney.\n\n\n\n                         March 15, 2010\n\f                 Per Curiam.     William Restucci has filed an application\n\nfor leave to file a \"second or successive\" habeas corpus petition\n\npursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b).1                     Restucci, who is currently\n\nserving a term of imprisonment for a 1995 voluntary manslaughter\n\nconviction in Massachusetts state court, has filed two prior\n\npetitions seeking habeas relief under 28 U.S.C. § 2254.                               In the\n\nfirst, Restucci challenged the constitutionality of his conviction\n\non various grounds, and his claims were denied on the merits.                            See\n\nRestucci v. Spencer, 249 F. Supp.2d 33 (D. Mass. 2003).                            The second\n\npetition,        in   which    Restucci      asserted       a   claim    of    ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel challenging the validity of his conviction,\n\nwas dismissed sua sponte by the district court as an unauthorized\n\nsecond or successive petition, and we subsequently denied leave to\n\nfile       it,    finding     that    it    failed     to       meet    the    gatekeeping\n\nrequirements          applicable     to    such    petitions.          See    28    U.S.C.   §\n\n2244(b).2\n\n\n       1\n      Petitioner has also filed a motion in which he appears to\nrequest that his state criminal case be \"transferred\" to federal\ncourt under 28 U.S.C. § 2254. Although it is framed differently,\nthe motion appears to seek leave of this court to file a § 2254\npetition asserting the same claims described in the initial\napplication. Accordingly, it is essentially duplicative and does\nnot require separate consideration.\n\n       2\n      Pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b)(2), a litigant may not file\na second or successive § 2254 petition unless:\n\n                 (A) the applicant shows that the claim relies\n                 on a new rule of constitutional law, made\n                 retroactive to cases on collateral review by\n\n                                             -2-\n\f          In   contrast   to   his    previous   petitions,   the   claims\n\nRestucci asserts in the instant application do not challenge the\n\nvalidity of the underlying conviction.        Instead, his claims arise\n\nfrom the Massachusetts Parole Board's denial of parole in May 2009\n\nand Restucci's alleged inability to appeal that denial through the\n\nstate's administrative and judicial processes. Although neither we\n\nnor the Supreme Court have specifically addressed whether a claim\n\nbased on the wrongful denial of parole is considered a \"second or\n\nsuccessive\" petition for purposes of 28 U.S.C. § 2244(b), the\n\ncourts of appeal that have decided the issue have concluded that\n\nsuch a claim is not \"second or successive,\" and therefore is not\n\nsubject to the § 2244(b) gatekeeping requirements, if the prisoner\n\ndid not have an opportunity to challenge the state's conduct in a\n\nprior § 2254 petition.    See, e.g., James v. Walsh, 308 F.3d 162,\n\n168 (2d Cir. 2002) (petition alleging miscalculation of conditional\n\nprison release date not \"second or successive\");          Pennington v.\n\n\n          the Supreme Court,           that   was   previously\n          unavailable; or\n\n          (B)(i) the factual predicate for the claim\n          could not have been discovered previously\n          through the exercise of due diligence; and\n\n             (ii) the facts underlying the claim, if\n          proven and viewed in light of the evidence as\n          a whole, would be sufficient to establish by\n          clear and convincing evidence that, but for\n          constitutional error, no reasonable factfinder\n          would have found the applicant guilty of the\n          underlying offense.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fNorris, 257 F.3d 857, 858-59 (8th Cir. 2001) (parole denial claim\n\nis not a \"second or successive\" claim).   See also Raineri v. United\n\nStates, 233 F.3d 96, 100 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"'The phrase \"second or\n\nsuccessive petition\" is a term of art,' designed to avoid abuse of\n\nthe writ\"); In re Cain, 137 F.3d 234, 236-37 (5th Cir. 1998)\n\n(concluding that \"Congress did not intend for the interpretation of\n\nthe phrase 'second or successive' to preclude federal district\n\ncourts from providing relief for an alleged procedural due process\n\nviolation relating to the administration of sentence of a prisoner\n\nwho has previously filed a petition challenging the validity of the\n\nconviction or sentence, but is nevertheless not abusing the writ\").\n\nWe agree that this is the only sensible reading of the statute; as\n\nthe Eighth Circuit noted in Crouch v. Norris, 251 F.3d 720 (8th\n\nCir. 2001), interpreting the term \"successive\" otherwise could\n\nforeclose state prisoners from challenging the constitutionality of\n\nthe execution of their sentences.     251 F.3d at 724-25; see also\n\nJames, 308 F.3d 162 (noting that 28 U.S.C. § 2254 is broader than\n\n28 U.S.C. § 2255 in that it allows a state prisoner to file a\n\nhabeas petition on the ground that he is \"in custody\" in violation\n\nof the Constitution or federal law.   28 U.S.C. § 2254(a)).\n\n          In this case, since Restucci's current claims arose well\n\nafter his prior habeas petitions and application for leave to file\n\na second or successive petition seeking review of his state court\n\nconviction were denied, he could not have raised them in the\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fearlier petitions; we therefore conclude, and the State agrees,\n\nthat the claims are not \"successive\" for purposes of § 2244(b).\n\nAccordingly, petitioner does not require authorization from this\n\ncourt prior to filing his parole-based claims in federal district\n\ncourt.\n\n          The application is dismissed as unnecessary with leave to\n\nre-file in the district court.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f",
