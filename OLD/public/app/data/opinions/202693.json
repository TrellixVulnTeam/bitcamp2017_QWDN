In this case, the district\n\ncourt eschewed any evaluation of the merits of a potentially\n\ndispositive   pretrial   motion   asserting    sovereign   and   qualified\n\nimmunity, instead denying the motion because it had been filed\n\nbeyond a clearly communicated deadline.       This interlocutory appeal\n\nensued.    After careful consideration, we conclude that we have\n\njurisdiction to entertain this appeal but that the district court\n\nacted within the encincture of its discretion in denying the\n\nbelated motion on temporal grounds.      The tale follows.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           In December of 2002, the plaintiffs (Digno E. Torres, his\n\nwife Betzaida Flores, and their daughter Joelly Torres-Flores)\n\nfiled a civil action in the United States District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Puerto Rico, in which they alleged that Torres-Flores,\n\nwhile attending high school, had been sexually harassed by the head\n\nof the school, Reynaldo Burgos.      Because the high school operates\n\nunder the aegis of the Puerto Rico Department of Education (the\n\nDepartment), the plaintiffs couched their claims against Burgos in\n\nterms of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.        They also named the Commonwealth of\n\nPuerto Rico as a defendant.       Building on the fact that the high\n\nschool receives federal funds, they couched their claims against\n\nthe Commonwealth in terms of Title IX of the Education Amendments\n\nof 1972.   See 20 U.S.C. §§ 1681-1688.    In that regard, they alleged\n\n\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fthat the Department had not taken appropriate action to rectify the\n\nsituation following its receipt of an administrative complaint.1\n\n           The   litigation   has   proceeded     in   fits   and   starts,\n\nprimarily because the parties have waged a number of pitched\n\nbattles on a wide variety of procedural fronts.           We recount here\n\nonly as much of this chiaroscuro history as is needed to put this\n\nappeal into perspective.\n\n           In May of 2004, the district court denied the defendants'\n\nmotions for dismissal of the section 1983 claims and for summary\n\njudgment on the Title IX claims.          Torres v. Puerto Rico, No. 02-\n\n2769, slip op. at 13 (D.P.R. May 5, 2004) (unpublished).            Because\n\nthis ukase rejected the defendants' asserted qualified immunity and\n\nEleventh   Amendment    defenses,    the     defendants   prosecuted     an\n\ninterlocutory appeal.    They simultaneously requested a stay of the\n\ndistrict court proceedings pending resolution of the appeal.\n\n           Neither the appeal nor the related stay request fared\n\nwell in this court.    Insofar as the Eleventh Amendment defense was\n\nconcerned, we dismissed the appeal without prejudice because the\n\nissue required further factual development and, thus, was not ripe\n\nfor interim appellate review.       See, e.g., Diaz v. Martinez, 112\n\nF.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1997); Stella v. Kelley, 63 F.3d 71, 74 (1st\n\n\n\n     1\n      The plaintiffs initially identified Burgos's supervisor and\nthe Puerto Rico Secretary of Education as additional defendants.\nNeither of these parties remains in the case, and we make no\nfurther mention of them.\n\n                                    -3-\n\fCir. 1995). We allowed Burgos's appeal to proceed on the qualified\n\nimmunity issue but refused to stay the district court proceedings\n\nsince his appeal seemed unlikely to succeed.   Shortly thereafter,\n\nBurgos dropped what remained of the appeal.\n\n          Meanwhile, the district court was struggling to keep the\n\ncase on track.   The court certified the defendants' appeal as \"a\n\nfrivolous one which is interposed solely for the purpose of delay\"\n\nand sanctioned the defendants for their dilatory tactics.2   These\n\ntactics rendered the original discovery deadline impracticable and\n\nforced the district court to vacate the trial date.      The court\n\nproceeded to set new deadlines: September 10, 2004, for completion\n\nof discovery and October 8 of the same year for the filing of\n\ndispositive motions.   The court unequivocally warned the parties\n\nthat \"[a]ny further delays or refusals to engage in discovery will\n\nresult in the imposition of further sanctions.\"\n\n          Despite this admonition, the parties sought a further\n\nextension of the discovery deadline.   Stating that its \"patience\n\n[was] at an end,\" the district court imposed monetary sanctions on\n\nboth sides. The record makes it perfectly plain, however, that the\n\ncourt placed the primary onus on the defendants; it sanctioned them\n\n\"[f]or their recalcitrant, defiant, and stubborn attitude and their\n\nrepeated and blatant disregard\" of court orders, and sanctioned the\n\n\n\n     2\n      The defendants filed a separate appeal from this order, which\nwe dismissed for lack of appellate jurisdiction.\n\n                               -4-\n\fplaintiffs   for    having     \"stood    idly      by\"   while    the   defendants\n\nlollygagged.3\n\n           Recognizing that discovery remained incomplete, the court\n\nextended   the    discovery    deadline       to   October   8,   2004,    and    the\n\ndeadline for filing dispositive motions to October 28, 2004.                      The\n\ncourt admonished, with conspicuous clarity, that (i) no further\n\nextensions   of    either     deadline    would     be   allowed    and    (ii)    no\n\ndispositive motions would be entertained after the designated date.\n\n           After vacating the original trial date, the district\n\ncourt fixed December 13, 2004, as the new trial date.                            At a\n\npretrial conference held on November 30, 2004 — after the discovery\n\nand dispositive motion deadlines had passed — the court informed\n\nthe parties that it had to vacate the anticipated trial date due to\n\nits crowded criminal calendar. Withal, the court did not resurrect\n\nor modify the expired discovery and dispositive motion deadlines.\n\nSimilarly, the court did not indicate any willingness to entertain\n\nlate-filed dispositive motions.           And in all events, no one moved\n\nfor leave to file dispositive motions out of time.\n\n           Notwithstanding this state of affairs, the defendants, on\n\nJanuary 14, 2005, filed a dispositive motion — a motion for\n\njudgment on the pleadings.       See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(c).             That filing\n\noccurred well beyond the court-appointed deadline for the filing of\n\n\n     3\n      Although the court eventually granted both parties' motions\nfor reconsideration of the monetary sanctions, its order\neffectively conveys the tenor of the proceedings at the time.\n\n                                        -5-\n\fdispositive motions.4     The district court's response was curt and\n\nto the point: the court denied the motion, noting \"that the\n\ndeadline for the filing of dispositive motions ha[d] long passed.\"\n\nThe court also propounded a second basis for denying the motion,\n\nobserving that the defendants had \"failed to include certified\n\ntranslations of their exhibits\" as required by the court's local\n\nrules.    This order forms the basis for the instant appeal — the\n\ndefendants' third interlocutory appeal in this case.\n\nII.   APPELLATE JURISDICTION\n\n           We   start   with   an   introspective   look   at   our   own\n\njurisdiction.    As a general rule, interlocutory orders are not\n\nimmediately appealable because they lack the requisite finality.\n\nSee Domegan v. Fair, 859 F.2d 1059, 1061 (1st Cir. 1988); see also\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1291.       Like every general rule, however, this rule\n\nadmits of certain exceptions.       The collateral order doctrine maps\n\nthe contours of one such exception.\n\n\n\n\n      4\n      While the district court labeled this deadline as a deadline\nfor the filing of summary judgment motions, the record makes\nmanifest both that the court intended the deadline to apply to all\ndispositive motions and that the parties knew that to be the case.\nTo their credit, the defendants have never suggested that they\nunderstood the deadline to be limited to summary judgment motions,\nnor have they argued — either here or in the court below — that the\ndeadline was inapplicable to their motion for judgment on the\npleadings. At any rate, that motion, though captioned as a motion\nfor judgment on the pleadings, explicitly relied upon deposition\ntranscripts and other information procured during discovery. It\nwas, therefore, the functional equivalent of a motion for summary\njudgment.\n\n                                    -6-\n\f           Under that doctrine, a district court's law-based denial\n\nof a pretrial motion that asserts a qualified immunity defense is\n\nimmediately appealable. See Mitchell v. Forsyth, 472 U.S. 511, 530\n\n(1985).   This is so, in part, because the defense conveys \"an\n\nentitlement not to be forced to litigate.\"        Id. at 527.     By like\n\ntoken — and for much the same reason — the law-based denial of a\n\npretrial motion that asserts a defense of Eleventh Amendment\n\nimmunity is immediately appealable.       See P.R. Aqued. & Sewer Auth.\n\nv. Metcalf & Eddy, Inc., 506 U.S. 139, 147 (1993).        The defendants\n\ncontend that, under these principles, we have jurisdiction to\n\nreview the challenged order now.\n\n           There is, however, another way to look at the matter.\n\nHere, the district court did not deny the defendants' motion on the\n\nmerits.   Viewed in terms of the district court's rationale, the\n\norder   seems   to   be   a   routine   case-management   order   —   and,\n\nordinarily, case-management orders are not amenable to immediate\n\nappellate review.    See, e.g., In re Recticel Foam Corp., 859 F.2d\n\n1000, 1003 (1st Cir. 1988).\n\n           The tension between these seemingly contradictory bodies\n\nof authority is more apparent than real.         We have held squarely\n\nthat because \"an asserted right not to stand trial is lost no less\n\nby a court's refusal to entertain a pre-trial immunity claim as by\n\nan erroneous denial of it on the merits,\" a district court's\n\nrefusal to consider the merits of a pretrial motion raising an\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\fimmunity defense — even a refusal couched as a case-management\n\norder — is immediately appealable.       Valiente v. Rivera, 966 F.2d\n\n21, 23 (1st Cir. 1992).       Since we are bound to adhere to prior\n\ncircuit precedent, see, e.g., United States v. Wogan, 938 F.2d\n\n1446, 1449 (1st Cir. 1991), we hold that we have jurisdiction over\n\nthis interlocutory appeal to the extent the appeal raises immunity\n\ndefenses.5\n\nIII.       ANALYSIS\n\n               Although the nature of the challenged order does not\n\ndeprive us of appellate jurisdiction, it does provide the prism\n\nthrough which we must view the lower court's decision.     Typically,\n\nwe would review the disposition of a motion for judgment on the\n\npleadings de novo.     See, e.g., Mass. Nurses Ass'n v. N. Adams Reg'l\n\nHosp., 467 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir. 2006).           Here, however, the\n\ndistrict court did not reach the merits but, rather, disposed of\n\nthe motion as a matter of case management.         Thus, a different\n\n\n       5\n      To the extent that the motion for judgment on the pleadings\nrested on other grounds, interlocutory review does not lie. See\nDomegan, 859 F.2d at 1061-62. Beyond that, the record reveals one\nfurther anomaly. Both in its brief and at oral argument in this\ncourt, the Commonwealth conceded that, as a condition of receiving\nfederal funding, it has waived its sovereign immunity from valid\nclaims under Title IX. See 42 U.S.C. § 2000d-7(a)(1); see also\nPederson v. La. State Univ., 213 F.3d 858, 875-76 (5th Cir. 2000);\nLitman v. George Mason Univ., 186 F.3d 544, 555 (4th Cir. 1999).\nThus, the Commonwealth does not appear to have a colorable legal\nargument with respect to its sovereign immunity defense.\nNevertheless, our jurisdiction seems clear as to the rejection of\nBurgos's qualified immunity defense to the section 1983 claims, see\nRosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez, 140 F.3d 312, 314-15 (1st Cir. 1998);\nValiente, 966 F.2d at 23, so we see no need to inquire further.\n\n                                   -8-\n\fstandard of review obtains: we examine challenged case-management\n\norders     solely   for   abuse   of   discretion.   See   Rosario-Diaz   v.\n\nGonzalez, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir. 1998).               Accordingly, the\n\nquestion we must answer is whether the district court abused its\n\ndiscretion in denying the motion by reason of the defendants'\n\nnoncompliance with a court-ordered deadline.6 As we explain below,\n\nthat question demands a negative answer.\n\n             We begin with bedrock: trial judges have an abiding\n\nresponsibility for the efficient management of the cases on their\n\ndockets.     To that end, the Civil Rules require a district judge to\n\nissue orders \"as soon as practicable\" fixing deadlines for the\n\ncompletion of discovery and the filing of dispositive motions.\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 16(b).        To help ensure that cases stay on track,\n\ndistrict judges are given express authority to sanction parties who\n\ndo not comply with these deadlines.           See Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(f).\n\n\"We have made it clear that district courts may punish such\n\ndereliction in a variety of ways, including but not limited to the\n\npreclusion of untimely motions . . . .\"         Rosario-Diaz, 140 F.3d at\n\n315.\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      To be sure, the district court initially mentioned a second\nground for refusing to entertain the motion: the defendants'\nfailure to furnish translations of documents accompanying its\nmotion.     That omission was rectified on a motion for\nreconsideration, so we assume, favorably to the defendants, that\nthe challenged order must stand or fall on the ground of\nuntimeliness.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f          Since the district court has first-line authority for\n\ncase-management decisions and is intimately familiar with the ebb\n\nand flow of the cases on its docket, an appellate court should\n\n\"step softly\" when it is asked to set aside a district court's\n\nchoice of sanctions for the violation of a case-management order.\n\nUnited States v. One 1987 BMW 325, 985 F.2d 655, 657 (1st Cir.\n\n1993).   It follows inexorably that a party attempting to convince\n\nus that the district court misgauged the situation faces a steep\n\nuphill climb.   See id.; see also Vélez v. Awning Windows, Inc., 375\n\nF.3d 35, 42 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          These principles apply equally when the trial court's\n\nsanctions intrude upon a defendant's ability to assert an immunity\n\ndefense before trial.    See, e.g., Guzmán-Rivera v. Rivera-Cruz, 98\n\nF.3d 664, 668 (1st Cir. 1996).    Although state entities and public\n\nofficials enjoy special protection from the vagaries of civil\n\nlitigation, this protection is not unlimited.        Because immunity\n\ndefenses may be raised at several different stages of a case, the\n\npotential for abuse is substantial.     For that reason, the right to\n\nassert an immunity defense must be balanced with the district\n\ncourt's obligation to ensure the \"just, speedy, and inexpensive\"\n\nresolution of cases.    Fed. R. Civ. P. 1.   With these considerations\n\nin mind, we have recognized that district courts may be justified\n\nin rebuffing pretrial attempts to assert immunity defenses if those\n\nattempts are not undertaken with a reasonable degree of diligence.\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fSee Guzmán-Rivera, 98 F.3d at 668; see also Ungar v. PLO, 402 F.3d\n\n274, 293 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            In this instance, we discern no basis for faulting the\n\ndistrict court's calibration of the decisional scales.               After all,\n\nthe defendants filed their motion a full eleven weeks after the\n\nexpiration of the court's extended deadline.                    In setting that\n\ndeadline,    the    court   had    stated    explicitly     that    no   further\n\nextensions would be given.          To make a bad situation worse, the\n\ndefendants did not even mention their planned course of action at\n\nthe pretrial conference, nor did they deign to seek leave of court\n\nbefore filing a motion that clearly violated the scheduling order.\n\n            It is difficult to imagine any circumstances in which a\n\ncourt should be expected to tolerate so brazen a flouting of its\n\ncase-management authority. The circumstances here are particularly\n\nunattractive: the defendants' actions were taken against a backdrop\n\nthat included an earlier finding that they had engaged in \"repeated\n\nand blatant disregard\" for the court's orders.             Under the doctrine\n\nof just desserts, a party who engages in a pattern of intransigent\n\nconduct is hard-put to complain when the court enforces its orders\n\naccording to their tenor.\n\n            The    defendants     attempt    to   blunt   the    force   of   this\n\nreasoning by noting the absence of a definite trial date (when it\n\nvacated the December 2004 trial date, the district court did not\n\nset a new one).      We rejected a virtually identical argument in an\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fearlier case where, as here, the district court did not predicate\n\nits denial of the motion on the imminence of trial but, rather, on\n\nthe need to sanction noncompliance with court orders. See Rosario-\n\nDiaz,       140     F.3d    at    316    (explaining     that   \"[l]itigants    could\n\ncomplicate exponentially the efficacious management of crowded\n\ndockets if left free to engage in the kind of dilatory behavior\n\nexhibited by the appellants as long as no firm trial date was in\n\nprospect\").          We see no reason to alter our stance today.7\n\n                  The defendants also suggest that they were unable to meet\n\nthe deadline for filing dispositive motions because their path to\n\nimmunity          was     not    clear   until     the   parties   reached     certain\n\nstipulations while preparing for the pretrial conference.8                        This\n\nargument is unsupported by the record.                   The district court denied\n\nthe defendants' earlier dispositive motions based primarily on the\n\nneed for the trier of fact to determine whether or not Burgos's\n\nacts        \"were       sufficiently     severe    to    compromise    the   victim's\n\neducational         opportunities        and   create    a   hostile   environment.\"\n\nTorres, supra, slip op. at 10.                   There are no stipulations in the\n\nrecord that can fairly be read to resolve this factual dispute.                    In\n\n\n       7\n      The defendants' reliance on Valiente, 966 F.2d at 23, is\nmisplaced. In Valiente, unlike in this case, the district court\npredicated its refusal to consider the defendants' dispositive\nmotion specifically on the imminence of the impending trial. See\nid.\n        8\n      The defendants make no persuasive explanation of why they\nwaited a full six weeks after the pretrial conference to file their\nmotion.\n\n                                            -12-\n\fall events, the defendants concede that the parties' contentions\n\nabout two of the incidents at issue — incidents involving Burgos\n\nand Torres-Flores — \"did differ substantially.\" Appellants' Br. at\n\n12.\n\n          Even if the freshly minted stipulations were as important\n\nas the defendants suggest, our conclusion would be the same.           The\n\ndistrict court was in the best position to assess the validity of\n\nthe proffered excuse for the untimely filing. The defendants could\n\nhave, but did not, ask that court to validate their excuse and\n\nextend the dispositive motion deadline on that basis.              Their\n\nfailure to do so speaks loudly about the insubstantiality of the\n\nexcuse.\n\n          We add a coda.   Whatever the merits of the excuse, trial\n\ncourts are not required to accept at face value litigants' reasons\n\nfor their failure to meet deadlines.        See Cordero-Soto v.

This interlocutory appeal ensued. After careful consideration, we conclude that we have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal but that the district court acted within the encincture of its discretion in denying the belated motion on temporal grounds. The tale follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December of 2002, the plaintiffs (Digno E. Torres, his wife Betzaida Flores, and their daughter Joelly Torres-Flores) filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, in which they alleged that Torres-Flores, while attending high school, had been sexually harassed by the head of the school, Reynaldo Burgos. Because the high school operates under the aegis of the Puerto Rico Department of Education (the Department), the plaintiffs couched their claims against Burgos in terms of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. They also named the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as a defendant. Building on the fact that the high school receives federal funds, they couched their claims against the Commonwealth in terms of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1681-1688. In that regard, they alleged that the Department had not taken appropriate action to rectify the situation following its receipt of an administrative complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The litigation has proceeded in fits and starts, primarily because the parties have waged a number of pitched battles on a wide variety of procedural fronts. We recount here only as much of this chiaroscuro history as is needed to put this appeal into perspective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May of 2004, the district court denied the defendants' motions for dismissal of the section 1983 claims and for summary judgment on the Title IX claims. <i>Torres v. Puerto Rico,</i> No. 02-2769, slip op. at 13 (D.P.R. May 5, 2004) (unpublished). Because this case rejected the defendants' asserted qualified immunity and Eleventh Amendment defenses, the defendants prosecuted an interlocutory appeal. They simultaneously requested a stay of the district court proceedings pending resolution of the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the appeal nor the related stay request fared well in this court. Insofar as the Eleventh Amendment defense was concerned, we dismissed the appeal without prejudice because the issue required further factual development and, thus, was not ripe for interim appellate review. <i>See, e.g., Diaz v. Martinez,</i> 112 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1997); <i>Stella v. Kelley,</i> 63 F.3d 71, 74 (1st Cir.1995). We allowed Burgos's appeal to proceed on the qualified immunity issue but refused to stay the district court proceedings since his appeal seemed unlikely to succeed. Shortly thereafter, Burgos dropped what remained of the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the district court was struggling to keep the case on track. The court certified the defendants' appeal as \"a frivolous one which is interposed solely for the purpose of delay\" and sanctioned the defendants for their dilatory tactics.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> These tactics rendered the original discovery deadline impracticable and forced the district court to vacate the trial date. The court proceeded to set new deadlines: September 10, 2004, for completion of discovery and October 8 of the same year for the filing of dispositive motions. The court unequivocally warned the parties that \"[a]ny further delays or refusals to engage in discovery will result in the imposition of further sanctions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this admonition, the parties sought a further extension of the discovery deadline. Stating that its \"patience [was] at an end,\" the district court imposed monetary sanctions on both sides. The record makes it perfectly plain, however, that the court placed the primary onus on the defendants; it sanctioned them \"[f]or their recalcitrant, defiant, and stubborn attitude and their repeated and blatant disregard\" of court orders, and sanctioned the plaintiffs for having \"stood idly by\" while the defendants lollygagged.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that discovery remained incomplete, the court extended the discovery deadline to October 8, 2004, and the deadline for filing dispositive motions to October 28, 2004. The court admonished, with conspicuous clarity, that (i) no further extensions of either deadline would be allowed and (ii) no dispositive motions would be entertained after the designated date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After vacating the original trial date, the district court fixed December 13, 2004, as the new trial date. At a pretrial conference held on November 30, 2004 &#8212; after the discovery and dispositive motion deadlines had passed &#8212; the court informed the parties that it had to vacate the anticipated trial date due to its crowded criminal calendar. Withal, the court did not resurrect or modify the expired discovery and dispositive motion deadlines. Similarly, the court did not indicate any willingness to entertain late-filed dispositive motions. And in all events, no one moved for leave to file dispositive motions out of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding this state of affairs, the defendants, on January 14, 2005, filed a dispositive motion &#8212; a motion for judgment on the pleadings. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). That filing occurred well beyond the court-appointed deadline for the filing of dispositive motions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The district court's response was curt and to the point: the court denied the motion, noting \"that the deadline for the filing of dispositive motions ha[d] long passed.\" The court also propounded a second basis for denying the motion, observing that the defendants had \"failed to include certified translations of their exhibits\" as required by the court's local rules. This order forms the basis for the instant appeal &#8212; the defendants' third interlocutory appeal in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with an introspective look at our own jurisdiction. As a general rule, interlocutory orders are not immediately appealable because they lack the requisite finality. <i>See Domegan v. Fair,</i> 859 F.2d 1059, 1061 (1st Cir.1988); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. Like every general rule, however, this rule admits of certain exceptions. The collateral order doctrine maps the contours of one such exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under that doctrine, a district court's law-based denial of a pretrial motion that asserts a qualified immunity defense is immediately appealable. <i>See Mitchell v. Forsyth,</i> 472 U.S. 511, 530, 105 S.Ct. 2806, 86 L.Ed.2d 411 (1985). This is so, in part, because the defense conveys \"an entitlement not to be forced to litigate.\" <i>Id.</i> at 527, 105 S.Ct. 2806. By like token &#8212; and for much the same reason &#8212; the law-based denial of a pretrial motion that asserts a defense of Eleventh Amendment immunity is immediately appealable. <i>See P.R. Aqued. &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.,</i> 506 U.S. 139, 147, 113 S.Ct. 684, 121 L.Ed.2d 605 (1993). The defendants contend that, under these principles, we have jurisdiction to review the challenged order now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, however, another way to look at the matter. Here, the district court did not deny the defendants' motion on the merits. Viewed in terms of the district court's rationale, the order seems to be a routine case-management order &#8212; and, ordinarily, case-management orders are not amenable to immediate appellate review. <i>See, e.g., In re Recticel Foam Corp.,</i> 859 F.2d 1000, 1003 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tension between these seemingly contradictory bodies of authority is more apparent than real. We have held squarely that because \"an asserted right not to stand trial is lost no less by a court's refusal to entertain a pre-trial immunity claim as by an erroneous denial of it on the merits,\" a district court's refusal to consider the merits of a pretrial motion raising an immunity defense &#8212; even a refusal couched as a case-management order &#8212; is immediately appealable. <i>Valiente v. Rivera,</i> 966 F.2d 21, 23 (1st Cir.1992). Since we are bound to adhere to prior circuit precedent, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Wogan,</i> 938 F.2d 1446, 1449 (1st Cir.1991), we hold that we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal to the extent the appeal raises immunity defenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the nature of the challenged order does not deprive us of appellate jurisdiction, it does provide the prism through which we must view the lower court's decision. Typically, we would review the disposition of a motion for judgment on the pleadings de novo. <i>See, e.g., Mass. Nurses Ass'n v. N. Adams Reg'l Hosp.,</i> 467 F.3d 27, 31 (1st Cir.2006). Here, however, the district court did not reach the merits but, rather, disposed of the motion as a matter of case management. Thus, a different standard of review obtains: we examine challenged case-management orders solely for abuse of discretion. <i>See Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez,</i> 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir.1998). Accordingly, the question we must answer is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion by reason of the defendants' noncompliance with a court-ordered deadline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> As we explain below, that question demands a negative answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with bedrock: trial judges have an abiding responsibility for the efficient management of the cases on their dockets. To that end, the Civil Rules require a district judge to issue orders \"as soon as practicable\" fixing deadlines for the completion of discovery and the filing of dispositive motions. Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b). To help ensure that cases stay on track, district judges are given express authority to sanction parties who do not comply with these deadlines. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(f). \"We have made it clear that district courts may punish such dereliction in a variety of ways, including but not limited to the preclusion of untimely motions....\" <i>Rosario-Diaz,</i> 140 F.3d at 315.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the district court has first-line authority for case-management decisions and is intimately familiar with the ebb and flow of the cases on its docket, an appellate court should \"step softly\" when it is asked to set aside a district court's choice of sanctions for the violation of a case-management order. <i>United States v. One 1987 BMW 325,</i> 985 F.2d 655, 657 (1st Cir.1993). It follows inexorably that a party attempting to convince us that the district court misgauged the situation faces a steep uphill climb. <i>See id.; see also V&#233;lez v. Awning Windows, Inc.,</i> 375 F.3d 35, 42 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These principles apply equally when the trial court's sanctions intrude upon a defendant's ability to assert an immunity defense before trial. <i>See, e.g., Guzm&#225;n-Rivera v. Rivera-Cruz,</i> 98 F.3d 664, 668 (1st Cir.1996). Although state entities and public officials enjoy special protection from the vagaries of civil litigation, this protection is not unlimited. Because immunity defenses may be raised at several different stages of a case, the potential for abuse is substantial. For that reason, the right to assert an immunity defense must be balanced with the district court's obligation to ensure the \"just, speedy, and inexpensive\" resolution of cases. Fed.R.Civ.P. 1. With these considerations in mind, we have recognized that district courts may be justified in rebuffing pretrial attempts to assert immunity defenses if those attempts are not undertaken with a reasonable degree of diligence. <i>See Guzm&#225;n-Rivera,</i> 98 F.3d at 668; <i>see also Ungar v. PLO,</i> 402 F.3d 274, 293 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, we discern no basis for faulting the district court's calibration of the decisional scales. After all, the defendants filed their motion a full eleven weeks after the expiration of the court's extended deadline. In setting that deadline, the court had stated explicitly that no further extensions would be given. To make a bad situation worse, the defendants did not even mention their planned course of action at the pretrial conference, nor did they deign to seek leave of court before filing a motion that clearly violated the scheduling order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is difficult to imagine any circumstances in which a court should be expected to tolerate so brazen a flouting of its case-management authority. The circumstances here are particularly unattractive: the defendants' actions were taken against a backdrop that included an earlier finding that they had engaged in \"repeated and blatant disregard\" for the court's orders. Under the doctrine of just desserts, a party who engages in a pattern of intransigent conduct is hard-put to complain when the court enforces its orders according to their tenor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants attempt to blunt the force of this reasoning by noting the absence of a definite trial date (when it vacated the December 2004 trial date, the district court did not set a new one). We rejected a virtually identical argument in an earlier case where, as here, the district court did not predicate its denial of the motion on the imminence of trial but, rather, on the need to sanction noncompliance with court orders. <i>See Rosario-Diaz,</i> 140 F.3d at 316 (explaining that \"[l]itigants could complicate exponentially the efficacious management of crowded dockets if left free to engage in the kind of dilatory behavior exhibited by the appellants as long as no firm trial date was in prospect\"). We see no reason to alter our stance today.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants also suggest that they were unable to meet the deadline for filing dispositive motions because their path to immunity was not clear until the parties reached certain stipulations while preparing for the pretrial conference.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> This argument is unsupported by the record. The district court denied the defendants' earlier dispositive motions based primarily on the need for the trier of fact to determine whether or not Burgos's acts \"were sufficiently severe to compromise the victim's educational opportunities and create a hostile environment.\" <i>Torres, supra,</i> slip op. at 10. There are no stipulations in the record that can fairly be read to resolve this factual dispute. In all events, the defendants concede that the parties' contentions about two of the incidents at issue &#8212; incidents involving Burgos and Torres-Flores &#8212; \"did differ substantially.\" Appellants' Br. at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the freshly minted stipulations were as important as the defendants suggest, our conclusion would be the same. The district court was in the best position to assess the validity of the proffered excuse for the untimely filing. The defendants could have, but did not, ask that court to validate their excuse and extend the dispositive motion deadline on that basis. Their failure to do so speaks loudly about the insubstantiality of the excuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a coda. Whatever the merits of the excuse, trial courts are not required to accept at face value litigants' reasons for their failure to meet deadlines. <i>See Cordero-Soto v. Island Finance, Inc.,</i> 418 F.3d 114, 117-18 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Jones v. Winnepesaukee Realty,</i> 990 F.2d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1993). That is particularly true where, as here, the parties offering the explanation have exhibited a pattern of dilatory conduct. <i>Cf. Spiller v. U.S.V. Labs., Inc.,</i> 842 F.2d 535, 537 (1st Cir.1988) (affirming sanctions when \"the history of foot-dragging evident in the record\" made it \"difficult to draw any other inference but that [the sanctioned party] did not intend to comply unless absolutely forced to do so\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Although we recognize the importance of defendants' rights to assert immunity defenses before trial, those rights are not sacrosanct. District courts have wide discretion to set reasonable deadlines for asserting such defenses, and they may impose condign sanctions on parties who do not comply. The sanction imposed here &#8212; effectively, disregard of a belated motion &#8212; was not an abuse of discretion. We therefore uphold the district court's order. The defendants, of course, remain free to assert their immunity defenses at trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Affirmed.</i> Costs are to be taxed in favor of the appellees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The plaintiffs initially identified Burgos's supervisor and the Puerto Rico Secretary of Education as additional defendants.

To their credit, the defendants have never suggested that they understood the deadline to be limited to summary judgment motions, nor have they argued &#8212; either here or in the court below &#8212; that the deadline was inapplicable to their motion for judgment on the pleadings. At any rate, that motion, though captioned as a motion for judgment on the pleadings, explicitly relied upon deposition transcripts and other information procured during discovery. It was, therefore, the functional equivalent of a motion for summary judgment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> To the extent that the motion for judgment on the pleadings rested on other grounds, interlocutory review does not lie<i>See Domegan,</i> 859 F.2d at 1061-62. Beyond that, the record reveals one further anomaly. Both in its brief and at oral argument in this court, the Commonwealth conceded that, as a condition of receiving federal funding, it has waived its sovereign immunity from valid claims under Title IX. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d-7(a)(1); <i>see also Pederson v. La. State Univ.,</i> 213 F.3d 858, 875-76 (5th Cir.2000); <i>Litman v. George Mason Univ.,</i> 186 F.3d 544, 555 (4th Cir.1999). Thus, the Commonwealth does not appear to have a colorable legal argument with respect to its sovereign immunity defense. Nevertheless, our jurisdiction seems clear as to the rejection of Burgos's qualified immunity defense to the section 1983 claims, <i>see Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez,</i> 140 F.3d 312, 314-15 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Valiente,</i> 966 F.2d at 23, so we see no need to inquire further.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> To be sure, the district court initially mentioned a second ground for refusing to entertain the motion: the defendants' failure to furnish translations of documents accompanying its motion.

This interlocutory appeal ensued. After careful consideration, we conclude that we have jurisdiction to entertain this appeal but that the district court acted within the encincture of its discretion in denying the belated motion on temporal grounds. The tale follows.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December of 2002, the plaintiffs (Digno E. Torres, his wife Betzaida Flores, and their daughter Joelly Torres-Flores) filed a civil action in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico, in which they alleged that Torres-Flores, while attending high school, had been sexually harassed by the head of the school, Reynaldo Burgos. Because the high school operates under the aegis of the Puerto Rico Department of Education (the Department), the plaintiffs couched their claims against Burgos in terms of 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1983. They also named the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico as a defendant. Building on the fact that the high school receives federal funds, they couched their claims against the Commonwealth in terms of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. <i>See</i> 20 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1681-1688. In that regard, they alleged that the Department had not taken appropriate action to rectify the situation following its receipt of an administrative complaint.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The litigation has proceeded in fits and starts, primarily because the parties have waged a number of pitched battles on a wide variety of procedural fronts. We recount here only as much of this chiaroscuro history as is needed to put this appeal into perspective.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In May of 2004, the district court denied the defendants' motions for dismissal of the section 1983 claims and for summary judgment on the Title IX claims. <i>Torres v. Puerto Rico,</i> No. 02-2769, slip op. at 13 (D.P.R. May 5, 2004) (unpublished). Because this case rejected the defendants' asserted qualified immunity and Eleventh Amendment defenses, the defendants prosecuted an interlocutory appeal. They simultaneously requested a stay of the district court proceedings pending resolution of the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither the appeal nor the related stay request fared well in this court. Insofar as the Eleventh Amendment defense was concerned, we dismissed the appeal without prejudice because the issue required further factual development and, thus, was not ripe for interim appellate review. <i>See, e.g., Diaz v. Martinez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197322\"><a href=\"/opinion/197322/rosario-diaz-v-diaz-martinez/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1997); <i>Stella v. Kelley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196256\"><a href=\"/opinion/196256/stella-v-kelley/\"><span class=\"volume\">63</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.1995). We allowed Burgos's appeal to proceed on the qualified immunity issue but refused to stay the district court proceedings since his appeal seemed unlikely to succeed. Shortly thereafter, Burgos dropped what remained of the appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, the district court was struggling to keep the case on track. The court certified the defendants' appeal as \"a frivolous one which is interposed solely for the purpose of delay\" and sanctioned the defendants for their dilatory tactics.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> These tactics rendered the original discovery deadline impracticable and forced the district court to vacate the trial date. The court proceeded to set new deadlines: September 10, 2004, for completion of discovery and October 8 of the same year for the filing of dispositive motions. The court unequivocally warned the parties that \"[a]ny further delays or refusals to engage in discovery will result in the imposition of further sanctions.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Despite this admonition, the parties sought a further extension of the discovery deadline. Stating that its \"patience [was] at an end,\" the district court imposed monetary sanctions on both sides. The record makes it perfectly plain, however, that the court placed the primary onus on the defendants; it sanctioned them \"[f]or their recalcitrant, defiant, and stubborn attitude and their repeated and blatant disregard\" of court orders, and sanctioned the plaintiffs for having \"stood idly by\" while the defendants lollygagged.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that discovery remained incomplete, the court extended the discovery deadline to October 8, 2004, and the deadline for filing dispositive motions to October 28, 2004. The court admonished, with conspicuous clarity, that (i) no further extensions of either deadline would be allowed and (ii) no dispositive motions would be entertained after the designated date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After vacating the original trial date, the district court fixed December 13, 2004, as the new trial date. At a pretrial conference held on November 30, 2004 &#8212; after the discovery and dispositive motion deadlines had passed &#8212; the court informed the parties that it had to vacate the anticipated trial date due to its crowded criminal calendar. Withal, the court did not resurrect or modify the expired discovery and dispositive motion deadlines. Similarly, the court did not indicate any willingness to entertain late-filed dispositive motions. And in all events, no one moved for leave to file dispositive motions out of time.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding this state of affairs, the defendants, on January 14, 2005, filed a dispositive motion &#8212; a motion for judgment on the pleadings. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(c). That filing occurred well beyond the court-appointed deadline for the filing of dispositive motions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The district court's response was curt and to the point: the court denied the motion, noting \"that the deadline for the filing of dispositive motions ha[d] long passed.\" The court also propounded a second basis for denying the motion, observing that the defendants had \"failed to include certified translations of their exhibits\" as required by the court's local rules. This order forms the basis for the instant appeal &#8212; the defendants' third interlocutory appeal in this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. APPELLATE JURISDICTION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with an introspective look at our own jurisdiction. As a general rule, interlocutory orders are not immediately appealable because they lack the requisite finality. <i>See Domegan v. Fair,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513189\"><a href=\"/opinion/513189/dennis-j-domegan-v-michael-v-fair/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1059</span></a></span>, 1061 (1st Cir.1988); <i>see also</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1291. Like every general rule, however, this rule admits of certain exceptions. The collateral order doctrine maps the contours of one such exception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under that doctrine, a district court's law-based denial of a pretrial motion that asserts a qualified immunity defense is immediately appealable. <i>See Mitchell v. Forsyth,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111481\"><a href=\"/opinion/111481/mitchell-v-forsyth/\"><span class=\"volume\">472</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">511</span></a></span>, 530, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111481\"><a href=\"/opinion/111481/mitchell-v-forsyth/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2806</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111481\"><a href=\"/opinion/111481/mitchell-v-forsyth/\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">411</span></a></span> (1985). This is so, in part, because the defense conveys \"an entitlement not to be forced to litigate.\" <i>Id.</i> at 527, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111481\"><a href=\"/opinion/111481/mitchell-v-forsyth/\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2806</span></a></span>. By like token &#8212; and for much the same reason &#8212; the law-based denial of a pretrial motion that asserts a defense of Eleventh Amendment immunity is immediately appealable. <i>See P.R. Aqued. &amp; Sewer Auth. v. Metcalf &amp; Eddy, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112800\"><a href=\"/opinion/112800/puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewer-authority-v-metcalf-eddy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">506</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">139</span></a></span>, 147, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112800\"><a href=\"/opinion/112800/puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewer-authority-v-metcalf-eddy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112800\"><a href=\"/opinion/112800/puerto-rico-aqueduct-and-sewer-authority-v-metcalf-eddy-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">121</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span> (1993). The defendants contend that, under these principles, we have jurisdiction to review the challenged order now.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, however, another way to look at the matter. Here, the district court did not deny the defendants' motion on the merits. Viewed in terms of the district court's rationale, the order seems to be a routine case-management order &#8212; and, ordinarily, case-management orders are not amenable to immediate appellate review. <i>See, e.g., In re Recticel Foam Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"513181\"><a href=\"/opinion/513181/in-re-recticel-foam-corporation-in-re-san-juan-dupont-plaza-hotel-fire/\"><span class=\"volume\">859</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1000</span></a></span>, 1003 (1st Cir.1988).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The tension between these seemingly contradictory bodies of authority is more apparent than real. We have held squarely that because \"an asserted right not to stand trial is lost no less by a court's refusal to entertain a pre-trial immunity claim as by an erroneous denial of it on the merits,\" a district court's refusal to consider the merits of a pretrial motion raising an immunity defense &#8212; even a refusal couched as a case-management order &#8212; is immediately appealable. <i>Valiente v. Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"584184\"><a href=\"/opinion/584184/iris-violeta-valiente-v-hon-ramon-luis-rivera-etc/\"><span class=\"volume\">966</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 23 (1st Cir.1992). Since we are bound to adhere to prior circuit precedent, <i>see, e.g., United States v. Wogan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"564953\"><a href=\"/opinion/564953/united-states-v-russell-h-wogan/\"><span class=\"volume\">938</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1446</span></a></span>, 1449 (1st Cir.1991), we hold that we have jurisdiction over this interlocutory appeal to the extent the appeal raises immunity defenses.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the nature of the challenged order does not deprive us of appellate jurisdiction, it does provide the prism through which we must view the lower court's decision. Typically, we would review the disposition of a motion for judgment on the pleadings de novo. <i>See, e.g., Mass. Nurses Ass'n v. N. Adams Reg'l Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">467</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></span>, 31 (1st Cir.2006). Here, however, the district court did not reach the merits but, rather, disposed of the motion as a matter of case management. Thus, a different standard of review obtains: we examine challenged case-management orders solely for abuse of discretion. <i>See Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197880\"><a href=\"/opinion/197880/rosario-diaz-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 315 (1st Cir.1998). Accordingly, the question we must answer is whether the district court abused its discretion in denying the motion by reason of the defendants' noncompliance with a court-ordered deadline.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> As we explain below, that question demands a negative answer.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with bedrock: trial judges have an abiding responsibility for the efficient management of the cases on their dockets. To that end, the Civil Rules require a district judge to issue orders \"as soon as practicable\" fixing deadlines for the completion of discovery and the filing of dispositive motions. Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b). To help ensure that cases stay on track, district judges are given express authority to sanction parties who do not comply with these deadlines. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(f). \"We have made it clear that district courts may punish such dereliction in a variety of ways, including but not limited to the preclusion of untimely motions....\" <i>Rosario-Diaz,</i> 140 F.3d at 315.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the district court has first-line authority for case-management decisions and is intimately familiar with the ebb and flow of the cases on its docket, an appellate court should \"step softly\" when it is asked to set aside a district court's choice of sanctions for the violation of a case-management order. <i>United States v. One 1987 BMW 325,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600264\"><a href=\"/opinion/600264/no-92-1827/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">655</span></a></span>, 657 (1st Cir.1993). It follows inexorably that a party attempting to convince us that the district court misgauged the situation faces a steep uphill climb. <i>See id.; see also V&#233;lez v. Awning Windows, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201113\"><a href=\"/opinion/201113/velez-cortes-v-awning-windows-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">375</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span>, 42 (1st Cir.2004).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These principles apply equally when the trial court's sanctions intrude upon a defendant's ability to assert an immunity defense before trial. <i>See, e.g., Guzm&#225;n-Rivera v. Rivera-Cruz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728080\"><a href=\"/opinion/728080/hector-guzmn-rivera-v-hector-rivera-cruz/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">664</span></a></span>, 668 (1st Cir.1996). Although state entities and public officials enjoy special protection from the vagaries of civil litigation, this protection is not unlimited. Because immunity defenses may be raised at several different stages of a case, the potential for abuse is substantial. For that reason, the right to assert an immunity defense must be balanced with the district court's obligation to ensure the \"just, speedy, and inexpensive\" resolution of cases. Fed.R.Civ.P. 1. With these considerations in mind, we have recognized that district courts may be justified in rebuffing pretrial attempts to assert immunity defenses if those attempts are not undertaken with a reasonable degree of diligence. <i>See Guzm&#225;n-Rivera,</i> 98 F.3d at 668; <i>see also Ungar v. PLO,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">274</span></span>, 293 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, we discern no basis for faulting the district court's calibration of the decisional scales. After all, the defendants filed their motion a full eleven weeks after the expiration of the court's extended deadline. In setting that deadline, the court had stated explicitly that no further extensions would be given. To make a bad situation worse, the defendants did not even mention their planned course of action at the pretrial conference, nor did they deign to seek leave of court before filing a motion that clearly violated the scheduling order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is difficult to imagine any circumstances in which a court should be expected to tolerate so brazen a flouting of its case-management authority. The circumstances here are particularly unattractive: the defendants' actions were taken against a backdrop that included an earlier finding that they had engaged in \"repeated and blatant disregard\" for the court's orders. Under the doctrine of just desserts, a party who engages in a pattern of intransigent conduct is hard-put to complain when the court enforces its orders according to their tenor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants attempt to blunt the force of this reasoning by noting the absence of a definite trial date (when it vacated the December 2004 trial date, the district court did not set a new one). We rejected a virtually identical argument in an earlier case where, as here, the district court did not predicate its denial of the motion on the imminence of trial but, rather, on the need to sanction noncompliance with court orders. <i>See Rosario-Diaz,</i> 140 F.3d at 316 (explaining that \"[l]itigants could complicate exponentially the efficacious management of crowded dockets if left free to engage in the kind of dilatory behavior exhibited by the appellants as long as no firm trial date was in prospect\"). We see no reason to alter our stance today.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants also suggest that they were unable to meet the deadline for filing dispositive motions because their path to immunity was not clear until the parties reached certain stipulations while preparing for the pretrial conference.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> This argument is unsupported by the record. The district court denied the defendants' earlier dispositive motions based primarily on the need for the trier of fact to determine whether or not Burgos's acts \"were sufficiently severe to compromise the victim's educational opportunities and create a hostile environment.\" <i>Torres, supra,</i> slip op. at 10. There are no stipulations in the record that can fairly be read to resolve this factual dispute. In all events, the defendants concede that the parties' contentions about two of the incidents at issue &#8212; incidents involving Burgos and Torres-Flores &#8212; \"did differ substantially.\" Appellants' Br. at 12.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the freshly minted stipulations were as important as the defendants suggest, our conclusion would be the same. The district court was in the best position to assess the validity of the proffered excuse for the untimely filing. The defendants could have, but did not, ask that court to validate their excuse and extend the dispositive motion deadline on that basis. Their failure to do so speaks loudly about the insubstantiality of the excuse.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add a coda. Whatever the merits of the excuse, trial courts are not required to accept at face value litigants' reasons for their failure to meet deadlines. <i>See Cordero-Soto v. Island Finance, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201762\"><a href=\"/opinion/201762/cordero-soto-v-island-finance-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">418</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">114</span></a></span>, 117-18 (1st Cir.2005); <i>Jones v. Winnepesaukee Realty,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"603794\"><a href=\"/opinion/603794/catherine-m-jones-v-winnepesaukee-realty/\"><span class=\"volume\">990</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 6 (1st Cir. 1993). That is particularly true where, as here, the parties offering the explanation have exhibited a pattern of dilatory conduct. <i>Cf. Spiller v. U.S.V. Labs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"503429\"><a href=\"/opinion/503429/michael-e-spiller-v-us-v-laboratories-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">842</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">535</span></a></span>, 537 (1st Cir.1988) (affirming sanctions when \"the history of foot-dragging evident in the record\" made it \"difficult to draw any other inference but that [the sanctioned party] did not intend to comply unless absolutely forced to do so\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">IV. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Although we recognize the importance of defendants' rights to assert immunity defenses before trial, those rights are not sacrosanct. District courts have wide discretion to set reasonable deadlines for asserting such defenses, and they may impose condign sanctions on parties who do not comply. The sanction imposed here &#8212; effectively, disregard of a belated motion &#8212; was not an abuse of discretion. We therefore uphold the district court's order.

To their credit, the defendants have never suggested that they understood the deadline to be limited to summary judgment motions, nor have they argued &#8212; either here or in the court below &#8212; that the deadline was inapplicable to their motion for judgment on the pleadings. At any rate, that motion, though captioned as a motion for judgment on the pleadings, explicitly relied upon deposition transcripts and other information procured during discovery. It was, therefore, the functional equivalent of a motion for summary judgment</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> To the extent that the motion for judgment on the pleadings rested on other grounds, interlocutory review does not lie<i>See Domegan,</i> 859 F.2d at 1061-62. Beyond that, the record reveals one further anomaly. Both in its brief and at oral argument in this court, the Commonwealth conceded that, as a condition of receiving federal funding, it has waived its sovereign immunity from valid claims under Title IX. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 2000d-7(a)(1); <i>see also Pederson v. La. State Univ.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">213</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">858</span></span>, 875-76 (5th Cir.2000); <i>Litman v.

Thus, the Commonwealth does not appear to have a colorable legal argument with respect to its sovereign immunity defense. Nevertheless, our jurisdiction seems clear as to the rejection of Burgos's qualified immunity defense to the section 1983 claims, <i>see Rosario-Diaz v. Gonzalez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197880\"><a href=\"/opinion/197880/rosario-diaz-v-gonzalez/\"><span class=\"volume\">140</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 314-15 (1st Cir.1998); <i>Valiente,</i> 966 F.2d at 23, so we see no need to inquire further.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> To be sure, the district court initially mentioned a second ground for refusing to entertain the motion: the defendants' failure to furnish translations of documents accompanying its motion.
