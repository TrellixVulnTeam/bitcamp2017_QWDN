Plaintiff-appellants Billings\n\nand Cheryl Mann, husband and wife, appeal from a district court\n\njudgment which (i) dismissed their claim that Chase Manhattan\n\nMortgage Company (“Chase”) violated the automatic stay provisions\n\nof the Bankruptcy Code, then (ii) denied their motions to amend the\n\ncomplaint.    We affirm the district court judgment.\n\n                                    I\n\n                                BACKGROUND\n\n            In 1993, the Manns and Chase entered into a $126,950\n\nmortgage loan and related security agreement which conveyed a lien\n\non   the   Manns’   principal   residence.   The   security   agreement\n\nprovided, inter alia:      “[Chase] may do and pay for whatever is\n\nnecessary to protect the value of the Property and [its] rights in\n\nthe Property . . . [including] paying reasonable attorneys’ fees.\n\n. . . Any amounts disbursed by [Chase] under this paragraph . . .\n\nshall become additional debt of the Borrower[s] secured by this\n\nSecurity Instrument.”1\n\n             After the Manns defaulted on their mortgage payments in\n\n1988, Chase fixed a date for a foreclosure sale and advised the\n\n\n\n\n      1\n      We review the summary judgment ruling de novo, accepting all\nrecord evidence in the light most condign to the Manns. See In re\nGosselin, 276 F.3d 70, 71-72 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n                                    2\n\fManns that it planned to inspect the property.2             On April 9, 1999,\n\nthe Manns filed their joint chapter 13 petition.\n\n              The $7,342.08 proof of claim submitted by Chase in the\n\nensuing chapter       13   proceedings       included   existing   loan-payment\n\narrearages ($5,698.55), as well as related prepetition attorney\n\nfees and inspection costs ($1,643.53).              Moreover, unbeknownst to\n\nthe Manns, Chase continued to accrue postpetition attorney fees\n\nagainst the Manns in its internal records, but neither submitted a\n\nproof of claim in the chapter 13 proceedings nor billed the Manns\n\nfor the postpetition fees.\n\n              The bankruptcy court order confirming the chapter 13 plan\n\n(i) allowed the $7,342 proof of claim filed by Chase, representing\n\nthe full mortgage arrearage and prepetition attorney fees, (ii)\n\ndirected the Manns to make all future mortgage payments directly to\n\nChase    as   and   when   due,3   and   (iii)   prescribed   that    unsecured\n\ncreditors were to receive not less than 17% on their allowed\n\nclaims.\n\n              Following the confirmation of their chapter 13 plan, the\n\nManns objected to the proof of claim filed by Chase, specifically\n\n\n     2\n      The district court rejected the contention that the\ninspection and foreclosure notifications issued by Chase violated\nthe terms of the Security Agreement. The Manns do not challenge\nthese rulings on appeal.\n     3\n      Unless otherwise provided in the chapter 13 plan, title to\nall property of the chapter 13 estate vests in the debtor upon\nconfirmation. See Barbosa v. Soloman, 235 F.3d 31, 37 (1st Cir.\n2000).\n\n                                         3\n\fchallenging its inclusion of $1,643.53 in prepetition attorney fees\n\nand inspection costs.         Before the bankruptcy court ruled on their\n\nobjection, however, the Manns withdrew it, opting instead to\n\ninstitute their putative class-action lawsuit in the United States\n\nDistrict Court for the District of Rhode Island.                The class-action\n\ncomplaint alleged, inter alia, that Chase willfully violated the\n\nautomatic stay provision, see Bankruptcy Code § 362, 11 U.S.C §\n\n362, in that, “subsequent to plaintiffs . . . filing bankruptcy,”\n\nChase continued to “charge” — viz., record charges in its internal\n\nloan files — the Manns for attorney fees and inspection fees\n\nincurred postpetition.\n\n            Following    discovery,        Chase   submitted    its   motion    for\n\nsummary judgment and the Manns submitted a motion to amend their\n\ncomplaint,    claiming       that   Chase    improperly      included    a    $2.00\n\nsurcharge in each of its prepetition inspection charges.                        The\n\nmotion to amend also sought to delete the Manns' earlier allegation\n\nthat Chase improperly had charged postpetition inspection fees.\n\nSubsequently, the Manns submitted another motion to amend their\n\ncomplaint    so   as    to    include      Raul    and   Jo-Ann     Rodrigues     as\n\ncoplaintiffs.     The second amended complaint asserted that Chase\n\nrecently had billed the Rodrigueses for $2,756.55 in postpetition\n\nattorney fees, notwithstanding its stated policy (reiterated in the\n\ninstant   appeal)      that    it   does    not    attempt     to   collect     such\n\npostpetition attorney fees from its mortgagors, provided they\n\n\n                                        4\n\fcomplete their chapter 13 plan payments and occasion no further\n\nmortgage-payment defaults.\n\n           The district court, in an unpublished opinion, directed\n\nsummary judgment against the Manns on their section 362 claim, then\n\ndenied their motions to amend the complaint.\n\n                                   II\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\nA.   The Automatic Stay\n\n           The Manns first contend that the mere recordation of\n\npostpetition, preconfirmation attorney fees incurred by Chase, on\n\nits internal   books,   violated   the       automatic   stay,    in    that    it\n\nconstituted either (i) “an[] act to obtain possession of the\n\nproperty of the estate or of property from the estate or to\n\nexercise   control   over   property    of    the   estate,”     11    U.S.C.    §\n\n362(a)(3), or (ii) “an[] act to create, perfect, or enforce any\n\nlien against property of the estate,” id. § 362(a)(5).                Of course,\n\nacts undertaken in violation of the automatic stay are not only\n\nvoid, see Soares v. Brockton Credit Union (In re Soares), 107 F.3d\n\n969, 976 (1st Cir. 1997), but may expose the violator to monetary\n\nsanctions as well, see 11 U.S.C § 362(h).\n\n           Generally speaking, the automatic stay prescribed in\n\nBankruptcy Code § 362(a) serves the salutary purpose of deterring\n\ncreditors from jockeying for advantage by, for instance:                       (i)\n\nseeking to convert an unsecured prepetition claim into a secured\n\n\n                                   5\n\fclaim; (ii) obtaining actual possession of property of the chapter\n\n13 estate; or (iii) attempting to perfect a judicial, statutory or\n\nother lien in such property.         See In re Soares, 107 F.3d at 975-76.\n\nThus, the automatic stay provision is designed to forfend against\n\nthe disorderly, piecemeal dismemberment of the debtor's estate\n\noutside the bankruptcy proceedings.          See id.\n\n             Viewed in this light, these postpetition bookkeeping\n\nentries by Chase did not implicate Bankruptcy Code § 362(a)(3),\n\nsince such unilateral accruals of amounts assertedly due, but in no\n\nmanner communicated to the debtor, the debtor's other creditors,\n\nthe bankruptcy court, nor any third party, plainly are not the sort\n\nof “act” Congress sought to proscribe.           See, e.g., In re Sims, 278\n\nB.R. 457, 471 (Bankr. E.D. Tenn. 2002) (noting that \"creditor could\n\nproduce all kinds of paperwork which if communicated to a debtor or\n\na    third    party    would   violate     the   stay,   but   absent      that\n\ncommunication, some overt act, or resulting effect on the debtor,\n\nno [§ 362] violation has occurred”) (collecting cases; emphasis\n\nadded).      Thus, the Manns' property, presently revested in them\n\nfollowing the confirmation of their chapter 13 plan, remains\n\nunaffected by the internal bookkeeping entries initiated by Chase.\n\nAs a consequence, absent any overt attempt by Chase to recover\n\nthese fees from the chapter 13 estate in the future, as (i) by\n\ninstituting collection proceedings which the Manns or the chapter\n\n13   estate    would   be   forced    to   defend   against,   or   (ii)    by\n\n\n                                       6\n\ftransmitting “harassing” communications to the Manns, the Chase\n\nbookkeeping entries represent mere unilateral notations regarding\n\nattorney fees which it assertedly incurred, thereby according it no\n\nidentifiable legal advantage over other creditors.\n\n            Nor did these mere bookkeeping entries, albeit effected\n\npostpetition      and    preconfirmation,     violate     Bankruptcy      Code    §\n\n362(a)(5).       The security agreement states that Chase may include\n\ncertain attorney fees in the Manns' loan balance.                Consequently,\n\nthese postpetition entries do indeed pose the prospect that the\n\namount due Chase, hence subject to its security interest, may\n\nincrease.       Nevertheless, a mere       potentiality of future liability\n\nreasonably      cannot   be   considered    the   “creation”     of   a   new    and\n\nenlarged lien.          The Manns have made no evidentiary proffer that\n\nChase has undertaken any action to modify its original record lien.\n\nAlthough    a    secured   creditor   may    record   a   lien   indicating       an\n\noriginal amount certain (e.g., the original loan balance), the\n\namount of a lien typically fluctuates during the term, as the\n\ndebtor repays the mortgage debt or other senior indebtedness, or as\n\nadditional charges accrue to their loan account.             Thus, until such\n\ntime as Chase initiates some external effort, either to fix or\n\nrecover upon, the amount of its secured or in rem indebtedness, the\n\n\n\n\n                                       7\n\flien       subsists    simply     as      a    recorded       prepetition      lien   of\n\nindeterminate value.4\n\n              The     case    authority       cited   by   the    Manns   is    plainly\n\ndistinguishable.             For instance, in In re Stark, 242 B.R. 866\n\n(Bankr. W.D.N.C. 1999), the bankruptcy court imposed subsection\n\n362(h) sanctions against a secured creditor on the grounds that (i)\n\nthe    loan    documents       accorded       the   secured    creditor   no    express\n\nauthority to assess postpetition inspection fees; and (ii) the\n\ncreditor nonetheless “attempted to collect” the inspection fees by\n\nmailing the debtors monthly statements reflecting the postpetition\n\ninspection fees.         Id. at 869, 872.5             Chase, on the other hand,\n\nnever communicated the attorney-fee charges to anyone; indeed, the\n\nManns would not have learned of these charges but for their\n\nsubsequent discovery proceedings before the district court. Cf. In\n\nre Soares, 107 F.3d at 975 (noting that automatic stay is designed\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      The proof of claim submitted by Chase in the chapter 13\nproceeding valued the secured claim at only $124,743.32. There is\nno indication that Chase included any postpetition attorney fees.\n       5\n      Similarly, in Fessenden v. Maine Savs. Bank (In re Nield), 95\nB.R. 259 (Bankr. D. Me. 1989), the secured creditor unilaterally\nremoved funds deposited in an escrow account, in the bank's\npossession, and which had been set aside to defray the insurance\npremiums and taxes on the mortgaged property as due. Id. at 260-\n61. And the court in In re Megan-Racine Assocs., Inc., 203 B.R.\n873 (Bankr. N.D.N.Y.), aff’d, 102 F.3d 671 (2d Cir. 1996), noted\nthat the creditor had “engaged in [the type of] self-help”\nprohibited under § 362 by unilaterally withdrawing sums from an\nescrow account in its possession. Id. at 878, 883.\n\n                                              8\n\fto   afford   debtors    “breathing      room”     free   from     creditor\n\n“harassment”).\n\nB.   Bankruptcy Code § 506(b)\n\n          Next, the Manns assert that Chase violated the automatic\n\nstay by failing to submit a preconfirmation request, pursuant to\n\nBankruptcy Code § 506(b),6 that any postpetition attorney fees be\n\nincluded in its allowed secured claim.           Chase contends, on the\n\nother hand, that the Manns waived any “claim” based on a § 506(b)\n\nviolation, by failing to include it in their several complaints.\n\n          Although Chase correctly states that the Manns failed to\n\nassert a § 506(b) “claim” in their various complaints,7 their\n\nargument was squarely raised and adequately preserved — as a\n\ntheoretical   adjunct   to   their   section     362   claim   —   in   their\n\n\n\n     6\n      Bankruptcy Code § 506(b) provides: “To the extent that an\nallowed secured claim is secured by property the value of which,\nafter any recovery under subsection (c) of this section, is greater\nthan the amount of such claim, there shall be allowed to the holder\nof such claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees,\ncosts, or charges provided for under the agreement under which such\nclaim arose.”    11 U.S.C. § 506(b).     Subsection 506(b) applies\nexclusively to postpetition fees accrued prior to confirmation of\nthe plan.    See 4 Lawrence P. King, Collier on Bankruptcy ¶\n506.05[3] (15th rev. ed. 2001).\n     7\n      The Manns never mentioned § 506(b) in their complaint, but\nsimply noted that Chase had made its postpetition internal\nbookkeeping entries “without obtaining court approval . . . [which]\nviolates the automatic stay.” These references reasonably could\nnot have placed the district court on fair notice that the Manns\nwere claiming a § 506(b) violation. Instead, the reference more\nplausibly implied simply that Chase was required to seek approval\nfrom the court for relief from the automatic stay pursuant to §\n362(d).\n\n                                     9\n\fopposition to summary judgment.            Citing five cases, the Manns\n\nasserted:     “The proper procedure for [Chase] to follow if it\n\ndesires to be compensated for post-petition charges, is to request\n\nCourt approval of those charges, pursuant to § 506 of the Code, and\n\nBankruptcy Rule 2016.”      In other words, the Manns contended that\n\nany unilateral imposition of postpetition fees by Chase must be\n\nviolative of § 362(a), given that the Code establishes specific\n\nprerequisites and a particular mechanism for imposing such fees,\n\nviz., § 506(b).\n\n            Nevertheless, the Manns' simple citation to Bankruptcy\n\nCode § 506(b) is insufficient to advance their § 362 claim on the\n\nmerits.     As a “significant exception” to the general rule that\n\ncreditors    cannot   recover      postpetition      fees    in   bankruptcy\n\nproceedings,   Bankruptcy   Code    §     506(b)   permits   an   oversecured\n\ncreditor to request that the bankruptcy court permit postpetition\n\nfees to be included in its oversecured claim, provided that the\n\npostpetition fees were (i) contemplated by the underlying contract;\n\nand (ii) “reasonable” in amount.          See 4 Lawrence P. King, Collier\n\non Bankruptcy ¶ 506.04[3] (15th rev. ed. 2001).              Since there are\n\nnumerous circumstances in which a chapter 13 discharge would not\n\nextinguish a secured claim, see Doral Mort. Corp. v. Echevarria (In\n\nre Echevarria), 212 B.R. 185, 187 (B.A.P. 1st Cir. 1997), § 506(b)\n\naccords secured creditors an advantageous prospect of recovering\n\nfull payment of their postpetition attorney fees.\n\n\n                                     10\n\f            As support for their contention, however, the Manns rely\n\nexclusively upon a series of unpublished bankruptcy court decisions\n\nwhich hold that a creditor’s failure to disclose, during the\n\nchapter 13 proceedings — e.g., by filing a proof of claim — its\n\ninternal recordation of such postpetition, preconfirmation attorney\n\nfees   on   its   internal   books   violates   §   506(b),   in   that   such\n\nnondisclosure frustrates the “fresh start” policy underlying the\n\nBankruptcy Code by precluding chapter 13 debtors from availing\n\nthemselves of a reasonable opportunity to satisfy (viz., discharge)\n\nsuch attorney fees through their chapter 13 plan.         See, e.g., In re\n\nSlick, No. 98-14378 (Bankr. S.D. Ala. May 10, 2002).               Assuming,\n\narguendo, the correctness of its holding, a matter we expressly\n\nrefrain from resolving, the Slick series of cases is readily\n\ndistinguishable.      That is to say, Slick directly holds that the\n\ncreditor’s nondisclosure violated § 506(b), rather than § 362, and\n\nthat the creditor’s fees were thus discharged.           Id., slip op. at\n\n12-13.\n\n            By contrast, the Manns neither contended before the\n\ndistrict court that Chase violated § 506(b), nor requested that the\n\ndistrict court declare the attorney fees discharged under their\n\nchapter 13 plan, but instead simply cited to § 506(b) as an adjunct\n\nto their § 362 claim asserting a violation of the automatic stay,\n\nviz., by way of statutory evidence informing the meaning of the\n\nterm “act” under § 362(a).       It is not surprising, therefore, that\n\n\n                                      11\n\fthe district court opinion did not rely upon § 506(b) as a discrete\n\nbasis for its decision.   Whatever the legal effect of the failure\n\nto submit an application or proof of claim under § 506(b), a matter\n\nwhich we need not resolve here,8 any such omission or waiver\n\nplainly would not constitute the sort of overt, affirmative act\n\nstayed by § 362(a).   Thus, the § 362 claim, as submitted by the\n\nManns, was properly dismissed by the district court.\n\n\n\n\n     8\n      Nevertheless, it is important to note that there is a serious\nquestion as to whether a discrete § 506(b) claim would be\nsufficiently ripe for adjudication at the present juncture.\nNormally, a claim is unripe where there are too many contingencies\nwhich might moot the claim. See, e.g., Bowen v. First Family Fin.\nServs., Inc., 233 F.3d 1331, 1340 n.7 (11th Cir. 2000). Chase has\nnever billed the Manns for these fees, nor communicated to any\nthird party its putative entitlement to the fees. Moreover, Chase\nrepresents on appeal that it will never seek to collect the fees\nunless the Manns were to default on their mortgage once again. See\nChamber of Commerce v. Reich, 57 F.3d 1099, 1100 (D.C. Cir. 1995)\n(in assessing ripeness, court should consider, inter alia, the\nhardship upon the parties were the court to withhold immediate\nreview of the claim). Although we might be reluctant to accept\nmere bald assurances regarding the latter contingency, it cannot be\nsaid with any confidence that its collection efforts are\ninevitable.\n          Second, although plainly not determinative on its own, we\nnote that the Manns have not yet completed their payments under the\nconfirmed plan. Unlike a chapter 11 debtor, which receives its\ndischarge upon plan confirmation, chapter 13 debtors obtain a\ndischarge only upon the successful completion of their required\npayments under the confirmed plan. See In re Roberts, 279 F.3d 91,\n93 n.1 (1st Cir. 2002). Should the Manns fail to do so, none of\ntheir debts would be discharged, let alone their putative\ncontractual    obligation   to   Chase   for   its    postpetition,\npreconfirmation attorney fees. Cf. In re Echevarria, 212 B.R. at\n188 (noting that creditor which waived recourse to § 506(b), until\ncompletion of confirmed plan, thereby waived right to collect §\n506(b) postpetition interest).\n\n                                12\n\fC.     The Motions to Amend the Complaint\n\n              Finally, we affirm the district court ruling rejecting\n\nthe motions to amend the Manns' complaint to plead new facts\n\nallegedly disclosed during discovery.                The Manns sought (i) to\n\nallege that Chase, absent any contractual authorization, added a\n\n$2.00 “surcharge” for each prepetition inspection charge posted to\n\ntheir mortgage loan account, and (ii) to add, as coplaintiffs, the\n\nRodrigueses, whom Chase recently had billed for the same type of\n\npostpetition, preconfirmation fees following the entry of the\n\nRodrigueses’ chapter 13 discharge, even though the Rodrigueses had\n\nnot defaulted again on their mortgage payments.\n\n              Trial court rulings on motions to amend a complaint are\n\nreviewed for abuse of discretion.              See Invest Almaz v. Temple-\n\nInland Forest Prods. Corp., 243 F.3d 57, 71 (1st Cir. 2001).                    Of\n\ncourse, the trial court may deny leave to amend, as a matter of\n\nlaw, where a proposed amendment would not cure the deficiencies in\n\nthe original complaint.        See Grant v. News Group Boston, Inc., 55\n\nF.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1995).        So it is here.\n\n              The first proposed amendment was defective due to the\n\nfact   that    the   Manns   failed    to    file   timely    objection   to   the\n\ninclusion of the subject surcharges in their chapter 13 plan.                   The\n\nsecond amendment was deficient in that (i) the Manns submitted an\n\ninsufficient Rule 56 proffer regarding their § 362 claim for the\n\npostpetition,        preconfirmation    attorney      fees,     and   (ii)     even\n\n\n                                        13\n\fassuming, arguendo, that the Rodrigueses held a viable claim under\n\neither § 362 or § 506(b), their standing did not confer standing\n\nupon the Manns.\n\n          Accordingly, the district court judgment is affirmed.\n\nThe parties shall bear their own costs.   SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                               14\n\f",

The security agreement provided, <i>inter alia:</i> \"[Chase] may do and pay for whatever is necessary to protect the value of the Property and [its] rights in the Property ... [including] paying reasonable attorneys' fees.... Any amounts disbursed by [Chase] under this paragraph ... shall become additional debt of the Borrower[s] secured by this Security Instrument.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Manns defaulted on their mortgage payments in 1988, Chase fixed a date for a foreclosure sale and advised the Manns that it planned to inspect the property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On April 9, 1999, the Manns filed their joint chapter 13 petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The $7,342.08 proof of claim submitted by Chase in the ensuing chapter 13 proceedings included existing loan-payment arrearages ($5,698.55), as well as related prepetition attorney fees and inspection costs ($1,643.53). Moreover, unbeknownst to the Manns, Chase continued to accrue <i>postpetition</i> attorney fees against the Manns in its internal records, but neither submitted a proof of claim in the chapter 13 proceedings nor billed the Manns for the postpetition fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court order confirming the chapter 13 plan (i) allowed the $7,342 proof of claim filed by Chase, representing the full mortgage arrearage and prepetition attorney fees, (ii) directed the Manns to make all future mortgage payments directly to Chase as and when due,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and (iii) prescribed that unsecured creditors were to receive not less than 17% on their allowed claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the confirmation of their chapter 13 plan, the Manns objected to the proof of claim filed by Chase, specifically challenging its inclusion of $1,643.53 in prepetition attorney fees and inspection costs. Before the bankruptcy court ruled on their objection, however, the Manns withdrew it, opting instead to institute their putative class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The class-action complaint alleged, <i>inter alia,</i> that Chase willfully violated the automatic stay provision, <i>see</i> Bankruptcy Code &#167; 362, 11 U.S.C &#167; 362, in that, \"subsequent to plaintiffs ... filing bankruptcy,\" Chase continued to \"charge\" &#8212; <i>viz., record</i> charges in its internal loan files &#8212; the Manns for attorney fees and inspection fees incurred postpetition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following discovery, Chase submitted its motion for summary judgment and the Manns submitted a motion to amend their complaint, claiming that Chase improperly included a $2.00 surcharge in each of its prepetition inspection charges. The motion to amend also sought to delete the Manns' earlier allegation that Chase improperly had charged postpetition inspection fees. Subsequently, the Manns submitted another motion to amend their complaint so as to include Raul and Jo-Ann Rodrigues as coplaintiffs. The second amended complaint asserted that Chase recently had billed the Rodrigueses for $2,756.55 in postpetition attorney fees, notwithstanding its stated policy (reiterated in the instant appeal) that it does not attempt to collect such postpetition attorney fees from its mortgagors, provided they complete their chapter 13 plan payments and occasion no further mortgage-payment defaults.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in an unpublished opinion, directed summary judgment against the Manns on their section 362 claim, then denied their motions to amend the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Automatic Stay</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Manns first contend that the mere recordation of postpetition, preconfirmation attorney fees incurred by Chase, on its internal books, violated the automatic stay, in that it constituted either (i) \"an[] act to obtain possession of the property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate,\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a)(3), or (ii) \"an[] act to create, perfect, or enforce any lien against property of the estate,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 362(a)(5). Of course, acts undertaken in violation of the automatic stay are not only void, <i>see Soares v. Brockton Credit Union</i> (<i>In re Soares</i>), 107 F.3d 969, 976 (1st Cir.1997), but may expose the violator to monetary sanctions as well, <i>see</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally speaking, the automatic stay prescribed in Bankruptcy Code &#167; 362(a) serves the salutary purpose of deterring creditors from jockeying for advantage by, for instance: (i) seeking to convert an unsecured prepetition claim into a secured claim; (ii) obtaining actual possession of property of the chapter 13 estate; or (iii) attempting to perfect a judicial, statutory or other lien in such property. <i>See In re Soares,</i> 107 F.3d at 975-76. Thus, the automatic stay provision is designed to forfend against the disorderly, piecemeal dismemberment of the debtor's estate outside the bankruptcy proceedings. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in this light, these postpetition bookkeeping entries by Chase did not implicate Bankruptcy Code &#167; 362(a)(3), since such unilateral accruals of amounts assertedly due, but in no manner communicated to the debtor, the debtor's other creditors, the bankruptcy court, nor any third party, plainly are not the sort of \"act\" Congress sought to proscribe. <i>See, e.g., In re Sims,</i> 278 B.R. 457, 471 (Bankr. E.D.Tenn.2002) (noting that \"creditor could produce all kinds of paperwork which <i>if communicated</i> to a debtor or a third party would violate the stay, but <i>absent that communication, some overt act, or resulting effect on the debtor, no</i> [&#167; 362] <i>violation has occurred</i>\") (collecting cases; emphasis added). Thus, the Manns' property, presently revested in them following the confirmation of their chapter 13 plan, remains unaffected by the internal bookkeeping entries initiated by Chase. As a consequence, absent any overt attempt by Chase to recover these fees from the chapter 13 estate in the future, as (i) by instituting collection proceedings which the Manns or the chapter 13 estate would be forced to defend against, or (ii) by transmitting \"harassing\" communications to the Manns, the Chase bookkeeping entries represent mere unilateral notations regarding attorney fees which it assertedly incurred, thereby according it no identifiable legal advantage over other creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did these mere bookkeeping entries, albeit effected postpetition and preconfirmation, violate Bankruptcy Code &#167; 362(a)(5). The security agreement states that Chase may include certain attorney fees in the Manns' loan balance. Consequently, these postpetition entries do indeed pose the prospect that the amount due Chase, hence subject to its security interest, may increase. Nevertheless, a mere potentiality of future liability reasonably cannot be considered the \"creation\" of a new and enlarged lien. The Manns have made no evidentiary proffer that Chase has undertaken any action to modify its original record lien. Although a secured creditor may record a lien indicating an original amount certain (<i>e.g.,</i> the original loan balance), the amount of a lien typically fluctuates during the term, as the debtor repays the mortgage debt or other senior indebtedness, or as additional charges accrue to their loan account. Thus, until such time as Chase initiates some external effort, either to fix or recover upon, the amount of its secured or <i>in rem</i> indebtedness, the lien subsists simply as a recorded prepetition lien of indeterminate value.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case authority cited by the Manns is plainly distinguishable. For instance, in <i>In re Stark,</i> 242 B.R. 866 (Bankr.W.D.N.C. 1999), the bankruptcy court imposed subsection 362(h) sanctions against a secured creditor on the grounds that (i) the loan documents accorded the secured creditor no express authority to assess postpetition inspection fees; and (ii) the creditor nonetheless \"attempted to collect\" the inspection fees by <i>mailing</i> the debtors monthly statements reflecting the postpetition inspection fees. <i>Id.</i> at 869, 872.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Chase, on the other hand, never communicated the attorney-fee charges to anyone; indeed, the Manns would not have learned of these charges but for their subsequent discovery proceedings before the <i>district court. Cf. In re Soares,</i> 107 F.3d at 975 (noting that automatic stay is designed to afford debtors \"breathing room\" free from creditor \"harassment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Bankruptcy Code &#167; 506(b)</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the Manns assert that Chase violated the automatic stay by failing to submit a preconfirmation request, pursuant to Bankruptcy Code &#167; 506(b),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> that any postpetition attorney fees be included in its allowed secured claim. Chase contends, on the other hand, that the Manns waived any \"claim\" based on a &#167; 506(b) violation, by failing to include it in their several complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Chase correctly states that the Manns failed to assert a &#167; 506(b) \"claim\" in their various complaints,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> their argument was squarely raised and adequately preserved &#8212; as a theoretical adjunct to their section 362 claim &#8212; in their opposition to summary judgment. Citing five cases, the Manns asserted: \"The proper procedure for [Chase] to follow if it desires to be compensated for post-petition charges, is to request Court approval of those charges, pursuant to &#167; 506 of the Code, and Bankruptcy Rule 2016.\" In other words, the Manns contended that any unilateral imposition of postpetition fees by Chase must be violative of &#167; 362(a), given that the Code establishes specific prerequisites and a particular mechanism for imposing such fees, <i>viz.,</i> &#167; 506(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the Manns' simple citation to Bankruptcy Code &#167; 506(b) is insufficient to advance their &#167; 362 claim on the merits. As a \"significant exception\" to the general rule that creditors cannot recover <i>postpetition</i> fees in bankruptcy proceedings, Bankruptcy Code &#167; 506(b) permits an oversecured creditor to request that the bankruptcy court permit postpetition fees to be included in its oversecured claim, provided that the postpetition fees were (i) contemplated by the underlying contract; and (ii) \"reasonable\" in amount. <i>See</i> 4 Lawrence P. King, <i>Collier on Bankruptcy</i> &#182; 506.04[3] (15th rev. ed.2001). Since there are numerous circumstances in which a chapter 13 discharge would not extinguish a secured claim, <i>see Doral Mort. Corp. v. Echevarria</i> (<i>In re Echevarria</i>), 212 B.R. 185, 187 (1st Cir. BAP 1997), &#167; 506(b) accords secured creditors an advantageous prospect of recovering full payment of their postpetition attorney fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As support for their contention, however, the Manns rely exclusively upon a series of unpublished bankruptcy court decisions which hold that a creditor's failure to disclose, during the chapter 13 proceedings &#8212; <i>e.g.,</i> by filing a proof of claim&#8212; its internal recordation of such postpetition, preconfirmation attorney fees on its internal books violates &#167; 506(b), in that such nondisclosure frustrates the \"fresh start\" policy underlying the Bankruptcy Code by precluding chapter 13 debtors from availing themselves of a reasonable opportunity to satisfy (<i>viz.,</i> discharge) such attorney fees through their chapter 13 plan. <i>See, e.g., In re Slick,</i> No. 98-14378 (Bankr. S.D.Ala. May 10, 2002). Assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> the correctness of its holding, a matter we expressly refrain from resolving, the <i>Slick</i> series of cases is readily distinguishable. That is to say, <i>Slick</i> directly holds that the creditor's nondisclosure violated &#167; 506(b), <i>rather than &#167; 362,</i> and that the creditor's fees were thus discharged. <i>Id.,</i> slip op. at 12-13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, the Manns neither contended before the district court that Chase violated &#167; 506(b), nor requested that the district court declare the attorney fees discharged under their chapter 13 plan, but instead simply cited to &#167; 506(b) as an <i>adjunct</i> to their &#167; 362 claim asserting a violation of the automatic stay, <i>viz.,</i> by way of statutory evidence informing the meaning of the term \"act\" under &#167; 362(a). It is not surprising, therefore, that the district court opinion did not rely upon &#167; 506(b) as a discrete basis for its decision. Whatever the legal effect of the failure to submit an application or proof of claim under &#167; 506(b), a matter which we need not resolve here,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> any such omission or waiver plainly would not constitute the sort of overt, affirmative act stayed by &#167; 362(a). Thus, the &#167; 362 claim, as submitted by the Manns, was properly dismissed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Motions to Amend the Complaint</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we affirm the district court ruling rejecting the motions to amend the Manns' complaint to plead new facts allegedly disclosed during discovery. The Manns sought (i) to allege that Chase, absent any contractual authorization, added a $2.00 \"surcharge\" for each prepetition inspection charge posted to their mortgage loan account, and (ii) to add, as coplaintiffs, the Rodrigueses, whom Chase recently had billed for the same type of postpetition, preconfirmation fees following the entry of the Rodrigueses' chapter 13 discharge, even though the Rodrigueses had not defaulted again on their mortgage payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial court rulings on motions to amend a complaint are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>See Invest Almaz v. Temple-Inland Forest Prods. Corp.,</i> 243 F.3d 57, 71 (1st Cir.2001). Of course, the trial court may deny leave to amend, as a matter of law, where a proposed amendment would not cure the deficiencies in the original complaint. <i>See Grant v. News Group Boston, Inc.,</i> 55 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1995). So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first proposed amendment was defective due to the fact that the Manns failed to file timely objection to the inclusion of the subject surcharges in their chapter 13 plan. The second amendment was deficient in that (i) the Manns submitted an insufficient Rule 56 proffer regarding their &#167; 362 claim for the postpetition, preconfirmation attorney fees, and (ii) even assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the Rodrigueses held a viable claim under either &#167; 362 or &#167; 506(b), their standing did not confer standing upon the Manns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, <i>the district court judgment is affirmed.

And the court in <i>In re Megan-Racine Assocs., Inc.,</i> 203 B.R. 873 (Bankr. N.D.N.Y.), <i>aff'd,</i> 102 F.3d 671 (2d Cir.1996), noted that the creditor had \"engaged in [the type of] self-help\" prohibited under &#167; 362 by unilaterally withdrawing sums from an escrow account in its possession. <i>Id.</i> at 878, 883.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Bankruptcy Code &#167; 506(b) provides: \"To the extent that an allowed secured claim is secured by property the value of which, after any recovery under subsection (c) of this section, is greater than the amount of such claim, there shall be allowed to the holder of such claim, interest on such claim, and any reasonable fees, costs, or charges provided for under the agreement under which such claim arose.\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 506(b). Subsection 506(b) applies exclusively to postpetition fees accrued<i>prior to confirmation</i> of the plan. <i>See</i> 4 Lawrence P. King, <i>Collier on Bankruptcy</i> &#182; 506.05[3] (15th rev. ed. 2001).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The Manns never mentioned &#167; 506(b) in their complaint, but simply noted that Chase had made its postpetition internal bookkeeping entries \"without obtaining court approval... [which] violates the automatic stay.\" These references reasonably could not have placed the district court on fair notice that the Manns were claiming a &#167; 506(b) violation. Instead, the reference more plausibly implied simply that Chase was required to seek approval from the court for relief from the automatic stay pursuant to &#167; 362(d)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Nevertheless, it is important to note that there is a serious question as to whether a discrete &#167; 506(b) claim would be sufficiently ripe for adjudication at the present juncture. Normally, a claim is unripe where there are too many contingencies which might moot the claim<i>See, e.g., Bowen v. First Family Fin. Servs., Inc.,</i> 233 F.3d 1331, 1340 n. 7 (11th Cir.2000). Chase has never billed the Manns for these fees, nor communicated to any third party its putative entitlement to the fees. Moreover, Chase represents on appeal that it will never seek to collect the fees unless the Manns were to default on their mortgage once again. <i>See Chamber of Commerce v. Reich,</i> 57 F.3d 1099, 1100 (D.C.Cir.1995) (in assessing ripeness, court should consider, <i>inter alia,</i> the hardship upon the parties were the court to withhold immediate review of the claim). Although we might be reluctant to accept mere bald assurances regarding the latter contingency, it cannot be said with any confidence that its collection efforts are inevitable.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Second, although plainly not determinative on its own, we note that the Manns have not yet completed their payments under the confirmed plan. Unlike a chapter 11 debtor, which receives its discharge upon plan confirmation, chapter 13 debtors obtain a discharge only upon the successful <i>completion</i> of their required payments under the confirmed plan. <i>See In re Roberts,</i> 279 F.3d 91, 93 n. 1 (1st Cir.2002). Should the Manns fail to do so, none of their debts would be discharged, let alone their putative contractual obligation to Chase for its postpetition, preconfirmation attorney fees. <i>Cf. In re Echevarria,</i> 212 B.R. at 188 (noting that creditor which waived recourse to &#167; 506(b), until <i>completion</i> of confirmed plan, thereby waived right to collect &#167; 506(b) postpetition interest).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The security agreement provided, <i>inter alia:</i> \"[Chase] may do and pay for whatever is necessary to protect the value of the Property and [its] rights in the Property ... [including] paying reasonable attorneys' fees.... Any amounts disbursed by [Chase] under this paragraph ... shall become additional debt of the Borrower[s] secured by this Security Instrument.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the Manns defaulted on their mortgage payments in 1988, Chase fixed a date for a foreclosure sale and advised the Manns that it planned to inspect the property.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On April 9, 1999, the Manns filed their joint chapter 13 petition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The $7,342.08 proof of claim submitted by Chase in the ensuing chapter 13 proceedings included existing loan-payment arrearages ($5,698.55), as well as related prepetition attorney fees and inspection costs ($1,643.53). Moreover, unbeknownst to the Manns, Chase continued to accrue <i>postpetition</i> attorney fees against the Manns in its internal records, but neither submitted a proof of claim in the chapter 13 proceedings nor billed the Manns for the postpetition fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bankruptcy court order confirming the chapter 13 plan (i) allowed the $7,342 proof of claim filed by Chase, representing the full mortgage arrearage and prepetition attorney fees, (ii) directed the Manns to make all future mortgage payments directly to Chase as and when due,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> and (iii) prescribed that unsecured creditors were to receive not less than 17% on their allowed claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following the confirmation of their chapter 13 plan, the Manns objected to the proof of claim filed by Chase, specifically challenging its inclusion of $1,643.53 in prepetition attorney fees and inspection costs. Before the bankruptcy court ruled on their objection, however, the Manns withdrew it, opting instead to institute their putative class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The class-action complaint alleged, <i>inter alia,</i> that Chase willfully violated the automatic stay provision, <i>see</i> Bankruptcy Code &#167; 362, 11 U.S.C &#167; 362, in that, \"subsequent to plaintiffs ... filing bankruptcy,\" Chase continued to \"charge\" &#8212; <i>viz., record</i> charges in its internal loan files &#8212; the Manns for attorney fees and inspection fees incurred postpetition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following discovery, Chase submitted its motion for summary judgment and the Manns submitted a motion to amend their complaint, claiming that Chase improperly included a $2.00 surcharge in each of its prepetition inspection charges. The motion to amend also sought to delete the Manns' earlier allegation that Chase improperly had charged postpetition inspection fees. Subsequently, the Manns submitted another motion to amend their complaint so as to include Raul and Jo-Ann Rodrigues as coplaintiffs. The second amended complaint asserted that Chase recently had billed the Rodrigueses for $2,756.55 in postpetition attorney fees, notwithstanding its stated policy (reiterated in the instant appeal) that it does not attempt to collect such postpetition attorney fees from its mortgagors, provided they complete their chapter 13 plan payments and occasion no further mortgage-payment defaults.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in an unpublished opinion, directed summary judgment against the Manns on their section 362 claim, then denied their motions to amend the complaint.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II</p>\n    <p class=\"center\">\n      <i>DISCUSSION</i>\n    </p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>The Automatic Stay</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Manns first contend that the mere recordation of postpetition, preconfirmation attorney fees incurred by Chase, on its internal books, violated the automatic stay, in that it constituted either (i) \"an[] act to obtain possession of the property of the estate or of property from the estate or to exercise control over property of the estate,\" 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(a)(3), or (ii) \"an[] act to create, perfect, or enforce any lien against property of the estate,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 362(a)(5). Of course, acts undertaken in violation of the automatic stay are not only void, <i>see Soares v. Brockton Credit Union</i> (<i>In re Soares</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197245\"><a href=\"/opinion/197245/soares-v-brockton-credit/\"><span class=\"volume\">107</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">969</span></a></span>, 976 (1st Cir.1997), but may expose the violator to monetary sanctions as well, <i>see</i> 11 U.S.C. &#167; 362(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Generally speaking, the automatic stay prescribed in Bankruptcy Code &#167; 362(a) serves the salutary purpose of deterring creditors from jockeying for advantage by, for instance: (i) seeking to convert an unsecured prepetition claim into a secured claim; (ii) obtaining actual possession of property of the chapter 13 estate; or (iii) attempting to perfect a judicial, statutory or other lien in such property. <i>See In re Soares,</i> 107 F.3d at 975-76. Thus, the automatic stay provision is designed to forfend against the disorderly, piecemeal dismemberment of the debtor's estate outside the bankruptcy proceedings. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed in this light, these postpetition bookkeeping entries by Chase did not implicate Bankruptcy Code &#167; 362(a)(3), since such unilateral accruals of amounts assertedly due, but in no manner communicated to the debtor, the debtor's other creditors, the bankruptcy court, nor any third party, plainly are not the sort of \"act\" Congress sought to proscribe. <i>See, e.g., In re Sims,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1850017\"><a href=\"/opinion/1850017/in-re-sims/\"><span class=\"volume\">278</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">457</span></a></span>, 471 (Bankr. E.D.Tenn.2002) (noting that \"creditor could produce all kinds of paperwork which <i>if communicated</i> to a debtor or a third party would violate the stay, but <i>absent that communication, some overt act, or resulting effect on the debtor, no</i> [&#167; 362] <i>violation has occurred</i>\") (collecting cases; emphasis added). Thus, the Manns' property, presently revested in them following the confirmation of their chapter 13 plan, remains unaffected by the internal bookkeeping entries initiated by Chase. As a consequence, absent any overt attempt by Chase to recover these fees from the chapter 13 estate in the future, as (i) by instituting collection proceedings which the Manns or the chapter 13 estate would be forced to defend against, or (ii) by transmitting \"harassing\" communications to the Manns, the Chase bookkeeping entries represent mere unilateral notations regarding attorney fees which it assertedly incurred, thereby according it no identifiable legal advantage over other creditors.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nor did these mere bookkeeping entries, albeit effected postpetition and preconfirmation, violate Bankruptcy Code &#167; 362(a)(5). The security agreement states that Chase may include certain attorney fees in the Manns' loan balance. Consequently, these postpetition entries do indeed pose the prospect that the amount due Chase, hence subject to its security interest, may increase. Nevertheless, a mere potentiality of future liability reasonably cannot be considered the \"creation\" of a new and enlarged lien. The Manns have made no evidentiary proffer that Chase has undertaken any action to modify its original record lien. Although a secured creditor may record a lien indicating an original amount certain (<i>e.g.,</i> the original loan balance), the amount of a lien typically fluctuates during the term, as the debtor repays the mortgage debt or other senior indebtedness, or as additional charges accrue to their loan account. Thus, until such time as Chase initiates some external effort, either to fix or recover upon, the amount of its secured or <i>in rem</i> indebtedness, the lien subsists simply as a recorded prepetition lien of indeterminate value.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case authority cited by the Manns is plainly distinguishable. For instance, in <i>In re Stark,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1844052\"><a href=\"/opinion/1844052/in-re-stark/\"><span class=\"volume\">242</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">866</span></a></span> (Bankr.W.D.N.C. 1999), the bankruptcy court imposed subsection 362(h) sanctions against a secured creditor on the grounds that (i) the loan documents accorded the secured creditor no express authority to assess postpetition inspection fees; and (ii) the creditor nonetheless \"attempted to collect\" the inspection fees by <i>mailing</i> the debtors monthly statements reflecting the postpetition inspection fees. <i>Id.</i> at 869, 872.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Chase, on the other hand, never communicated the attorney-fee charges to anyone; indeed, the Manns would not have learned of these charges but for their subsequent discovery proceedings before the <i>district court. Cf. In re Soares,</i> 107 F.3d at 975 (noting that automatic stay is designed to afford debtors \"breathing room\" free from creditor \"harassment\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Bankruptcy Code &#167; 506(b)</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next, the Manns assert that Chase violated the automatic stay by failing to submit a preconfirmation request, pursuant to Bankruptcy Code &#167; 506(b),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> that any postpetition attorney fees be included in its allowed secured claim. Chase contends, on the other hand, that the Manns waived any \"claim\" based on a &#167; 506(b) violation, by failing to include it in their several complaints.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Chase correctly states that the Manns failed to assert a &#167; 506(b) \"claim\" in their various complaints,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> their argument was squarely raised and adequately preserved &#8212; as a theoretical adjunct to their section 362 claim &#8212; in their opposition to summary judgment. Citing five cases, the Manns asserted: \"The proper procedure for [Chase] to follow if it desires to be compensated for post-petition charges, is to request Court approval of those charges, pursuant to &#167; 506 of the Code, and Bankruptcy Rule 2016.\" In other words, the Manns contended that any unilateral imposition of postpetition fees by Chase must be violative of &#167; 362(a), given that the Code establishes specific prerequisites and a particular mechanism for imposing such fees, <i>viz.,</i> &#167; 506(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nevertheless, the Manns' simple citation to Bankruptcy Code &#167; 506(b) is insufficient to advance their &#167; 362 claim on the merits. As a \"significant exception\" to the general rule that creditors cannot recover <i>postpetition</i> fees in bankruptcy proceedings, Bankruptcy Code &#167; 506(b) permits an oversecured creditor to request that the bankruptcy court permit postpetition fees to be included in its oversecured claim, provided that the postpetition fees were (i) contemplated by the underlying contract; and (ii) \"reasonable\" in amount. <i>See</i> 4 Lawrence P. King, <i>Collier on Bankruptcy</i> &#182; 506.04[3] (15th rev. ed.2001). Since there are numerous circumstances in which a chapter 13 discharge would not extinguish a secured claim, <i>see Doral Mort. Corp. v. Echevarria</i> (<i>In re Echevarria</i>), <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1535550\"><a href=\"/opinion/1535550/in-re-echevarria/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">B.R.</span> <span class=\"page\">185</span></a></span>, 187 (1st Cir. BAP 1997), &#167; 506(b) accords secured creditors an advantageous prospect of recovering full payment of their postpetition attorney fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As support for their contention, however, the Manns rely exclusively upon a series of unpublished bankruptcy court decisions which hold that a creditor's failure to disclose, during the chapter 13 proceedings &#8212; <i>e.g.,</i> by filing a proof of claim&#8212; its internal recordation of such postpetition, preconfirmation attorney fees on its internal books violates &#167; 506(b), in that such nondisclosure frustrates the \"fresh start\" policy underlying the Bankruptcy Code by precluding chapter 13 debtors from availing themselves of a reasonable opportunity to satisfy (<i>viz.,</i> discharge) such attorney fees through their chapter 13 plan. <i>See, e.g., In re Slick,</i> No. 98-14378 (Bankr. S.D.Ala. May 10, 2002). Assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> the correctness of its holding, a matter we expressly refrain from resolving, the <i>Slick</i> series of cases is readily distinguishable. That is to say, <i>Slick</i> directly holds that the creditor's nondisclosure violated &#167; 506(b), <i>rather than &#167; 362,</i> and that the creditor's fees were thus discharged. <i>Id.,</i> slip op. at 12-13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, the Manns neither contended before the district court that Chase violated &#167; 506(b), nor requested that the district court declare the attorney fees discharged under their chapter 13 plan, but instead simply cited to &#167; 506(b) as an <i>adjunct</i> to their &#167; 362 claim asserting a violation of the automatic stay, <i>viz.,</i> by way of statutory evidence informing the meaning of the term \"act\" under &#167; 362(a). It is not surprising, therefore, that the district court opinion did not rely upon &#167; 506(b) as a discrete basis for its decision. Whatever the legal effect of the failure to submit an application or proof of claim under &#167; 506(b), a matter which we need not resolve here,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> any such omission or waiver plainly would not constitute the sort of overt, affirmative act stayed by &#167; 362(a). Thus, the &#167; 362 claim, as submitted by the Manns, was properly dismissed by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>The Motions to Amend the Complaint</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we affirm the district court ruling rejecting the motions to amend the Manns' complaint to plead new facts allegedly disclosed during discovery. The Manns sought (i) to allege that Chase, absent any contractual authorization, added a $2.00 \"surcharge\" for each prepetition inspection charge posted to their mortgage loan account, and (ii) to add, as coplaintiffs, the Rodrigueses, whom Chase recently had billed for the same type of postpetition, preconfirmation fees following the entry of the Rodrigueses' chapter 13 discharge, even though the Rodrigueses had not defaulted again on their mortgage payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Trial court rulings on motions to amend a complaint are reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>See Invest Almaz v. Temple-Inland Forest Prods. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199312\"><a href=\"/opinion/199312/invest-almaz-v-temple-inland/\"><span class=\"volume\">243</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 71 (1st Cir.2001). Of course, the trial court may deny leave to amend, as a matter of law, where a proposed amendment would not cure the deficiencies in the original complaint. <i>See Grant v. News Group Boston, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">55</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></span>, 5 (1st Cir.1995). So it is here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first proposed amendment was defective due to the fact that the Manns failed to file timely objection to the inclusion of the subject surcharges in their chapter 13 plan. The second amendment was deficient in that (i) the Manns submitted an insufficient Rule 56 proffer regarding their &#167; 362 claim for the postpetition, preconfirmation attorney fees, and (ii) even assuming, <i>arguendo,</i> that the Rodrigueses held a viable claim under either &#167; 362 or &#167; 506(b), their standing did not confer standing upon the Manns.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Accordingly, <i>the district court judgment is affirmed.

Instead, the reference more plausibly implied simply that Chase was required to seek approval from the court for relief from the automatic stay pursuant to &#167; 362(d)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Nevertheless, it is important to note that there is a serious question as to whether a discrete &#167; 506(b) claim would be sufficiently ripe for adjudication at the present juncture. Normally, a claim is unripe where there are too many contingencies which might moot the claim<i>See, e.g., Bowen v. First Family Fin. Servs., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"771316\"><a href=\"/opinion/771316/ozie-bowen-on-behalf-of-himself-and-all-others-similarly-situated-v-first/\"><span class=\"volume\">233</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1331</span></a></span>, 1340 n. 7 (11th Cir.2000). Chase has never billed the Manns for these fees, nor communicated to any third party its putative entitlement to the fees. Moreover, Chase represents on appeal that it will never seek to collect the fees unless the Manns were to default on their mortgage once again. <i>See Chamber of Commerce v.

Although we might be reluctant to accept mere bald assurances regarding the latter contingency, it cannot be said with any confidence that its collection efforts are inevitable.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Second, although plainly not determinative on its own, we note that the Manns have not yet completed their payments under the confirmed plan. Unlike a chapter 11 debtor, which receives its discharge upon plan confirmation, chapter 13 debtors obtain a discharge only upon the successful <i>completion</i> of their required payments under the confirmed plan. <i>See In re Roberts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199824\"><a href=\"/opinion/199824/roberts-v-boyajian/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">91</span></a></span>, 93 n. 1 (1st Cir.2002). Should the Manns fail to do so, none of their debts would be discharged, let alone their putative contractual obligation to Chase for its postpetition, preconfirmation attorney fees. <i>Cf. In re Echevarria,</i> 212 B.R. at 188 (noting that creditor which waived recourse to &#167; 506(b), until <i>completion</i> of confirmed plan, thereby waived right to collect &#167; 506(b) postpetition interest).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
