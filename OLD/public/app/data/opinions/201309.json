In this case involving a claim\n\nfor maintenance and cure benefits by a seaman suffering from\n\nmultiple sclerosis, plaintiff-appellant Melodee Whitman (\"Whitman\")\n\nappeals from an order of the district court granting defendant-\n\nappellee Rick Miles's (\"Miles\") motion for summary judgment.                 We\n\naffirm.\n\n                               I.   Background\n\n            We review the entry of summary judgment de novo, viewing\n\nthe facts in the light most favorable to the party opposing summary\n\njudgment, in this case Whitman.            GTE Wireless, Inc. v. Cellexis\n\nInt'l, Inc., 341 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2003).               Summary judgment is\n\nappropriate     \"if    the     pleadings,       depositions,      answers   to\n\ninterrogatories,      and    admissions    on   file,     together   with   the\n\naffidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment\n\nas a matter of law.\"        Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n            On July 17, 2000, while working as a cook on Miles's\n\nship, the S/V Timberland, Whitman had to be driven to a hospital\n\nafter falling several times on the ship, burning herself while\n\ncooking, and experiencing other symptoms including fatigue, cold,\n\nnumbness,   and   incontinence.        Following     an    MRI,   Whitman   was\n\ndiagnosed with multiple sclerosis (\"MS\"), an autoimmune disease\n\nthat causes a person's immune system to attack healthy tissue in\n\nthe body.     Whitman has what is known as \"relapsing-remitting\" MS,\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fwhich is characterized by symptoms that manifest themselves in\n\nsporadic, unpredictable exacerbations that flare up and then die\n\ndown. Sometimes the symptoms completely clear; other times they do\n\nnot.     While not fatal, MS is a permanent disease with no known\n\ncure.1\n\n               On August 3, 2000, Whitman saw Dr. Judd Jensen for a\n\nfollow-up visit.          Dr. Jensen noted significant improvement in\n\nWhitman's      status   since    her    hospital   visit   on   July    17,   2000.\n\nDr. Jensen also reiterated that the MRI findings were strongly\n\nsuggestive of MS.         On August 15, 2000, Whitman saw Dr. Howard\n\nWeiner for an evaluation.            Dr. Weiner, an MS specialist, described\n\nWhitman's initial symptoms and MRI as classic for MS.                       After a\n\nneurologic examination, Dr. Weiner found that Whitman had a normal\n\ngait     and   there    were    no   other   motor,   cerebellar,      or   sensory\n\nfindings.       He also found that Whitman was continent and only had\n\nsome mild tingling feelings.\n\n               Shortly after Dr. Weiner's August 15 evaluation, Whitman\n\nbegan taking Betaseron, a disease-modifying medication that acts at\n\nthe cellular level to alter the immune system's response to MS.                  On\n\nOctober 4, 2000, Whitman saw Dr. Jensen and complained of numbness\n\nand loss of balance.           On November 17, 2000, Whitman again visited\n\nDr. Jensen, who noted that the recent exacerbation had resolved in\n\n\n\n1\n    In her brief, Whitman acknowledges that MS is a permanent\ndisease.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fa couple of days, that her neurologic examination was essentially\n\nnormal, and that she was asymptomatic.\n\n           Since July 2000, Whitman has had several exacerbations,\n\nwith symptoms including vision problems, memory loss, dizziness,\n\nlightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, numbness, leg spasms, partial\n\nparalysis to one side of her face, and foot drop.             Some, but not\n\nall, of these symptoms have faded or disappeared.          Whitman's last\n\nexacerbation occurred in November 2002.       Whitman also suffers from\n\ndepression, for which she takes medication.          Depression is common\n\namong patients with MS.\n\n           Through his insurer, Miles paid Whitman's medical bills\n\nfor her initial diagnosis and treatment.         Miles did not pay for any\n\nliving expenses or treatment after the diagnosis.          In August 2000,\n\nWhitman spoke by phone with Patrick O'Toole of Acadia Insurance\n\nCompany, which is Miles's insurer, and requested maintenance and\n\ncure benefits.     In a letter dated August 21, 2000, Acadia denied\n\nWhitman   benefits    beyond   the   emergency    treatment      and   initial\n\ndiagnosis.   On March 6, 2003, Whitman filed suit in            Maine federal\n\ndistrict court, seeking past and ongoing maintenance and cure\n\n(\"Count I\"), as well as attorney's fees for unreasonable refusal to\n\npay maintenance and cure (\"Count II\").       On August 28, 2003, Miles\n\nmoved for summary judgment.\n\n           Miles     originally   argued   that    his   duty    to    provide\n\nmaintenance and cure ended on July 18, 2000, when Whitman was first\n\n\n                                     -4-\n\fdiagnosed with MS.   At oral argument before the district court,\n\nMiles conceded that the duty to provide maintenance and cure\n\nextended for a short time after diagnosis, and agreed to pay for\n\nWhitman's medical expenses up to August 15, 2000.2   On November 20,\n\n2003, the district court partially granted Miles's motion for\n\nsummary judgment on Count I, finding that August 15, 2000 was the\n\ndate of maximum medical recovery.     The district court concluded\n\nthat Miles was entitled to summary judgment for \"all maintenance\n\nand cure after August 15, 2000, and for lodging expenses in their\n\nentirety.\"3   Whitman v. Miles, 294 F. Supp. 2d 117, 125 (D. Me.\n\n2003).   The district court also granted summary judgment on Count\n\nII.   This appeal followed.\n\n\n\n\n2\n   How the date August 15, 2000 was reached bears mentioning.\nMiles, relying on Calmar S.S. Corp. v. Taylor, 303 U.S. 525, 530\n(1938), conceded that his duty to provide maintenance and cure\ncontinued for a reasonable time after diagnosis. In its decision,\nthe district court noted that the standard in Calmar was superceded\nby the Shipowner's Liability Convention and found that under the\nConvention maintenance and cure benefits continue until the sailor\nis \"so far cured as possible\". Farrell v. United States, 336 U.S.\n511, 518 (1949). However, because Miles conceded liability for\nmaintenance and cure until August 15, 2000, the district court\nassumed that Miles's duty did not end before that date.         The\ndistrict court, using the test in Farrell, later found that\nAugust 15, 2000 was also the date of maximum medical recovery.\n3\n   The district court found that, because Whitman lived with a\nfriend and did not pay rent between July 18, 2000 and August 15,\n2000, Miles was not obligated to pay for her lodging.\n\n                                -5-\n\f                             II.    Discussion\n\nA.   Maintenance and Cure\n\n            \"Maintenance    and    cure    is   the   traditional   form   of\n\ncompensation paid to a seaman who becomes ill or injured aboard a\n\nvessel.\"     Richards v. Relentless, Inc., 341 F.3d 35, 40 n.1 (1st\n\nCir. 2003)(citing Calmar S.S. Corp. v. Taylor, 303 U.S. 525, 527-\n\n528 (1938)).    \"The duty of paying maintenance and cure falls to the\n\nowner of the vessel.\"      Id.    \"The term refers to the provision of,\n\nor payment for, food and lodging ('maintenance') as well as any\n\nnecessary health-care expenses ('cure') incurred during the period\n\nof recovery from an injury or malady.\"          Ferrara v. A. & V. Fishing,\n\nInc., 99 F.3d 449, 454 (1st Cir. 1996)(quoting LeBlanc v. B.G.T.\n\nCorp., 992 F.2d 394, 397 (1st Cir. 1999)(internal quotation marks\n\nomitted)).     The right to maintenance and cure applies only to\n\n\"seamen\" who are injured or fall ill while \"in service of the\n\nship.\"     LeBlanc, 992 F.2d at 396.         The right applies until the\n\nseaman is \"so far cured as possible.\"           Farrell v. United States,\n\n336 U.S. 511, 518 (1949); Ferrara, 99 F.3d at 454.\n\n             When a seaman's \"condition has stabilized and further\n\nprogress ended short of a full recovery, the seaman . . . is no\n\nlonger entitled to maintenance and cure.\"             In re RJF Int'l Corp.\n\nfor Exoneration from or Limitation of Liab., 354 F.3d 104, 106 (1st\n\nCir. 2004).    This point in time is known as the seaman's \"maximum\n\nmedical recovery.\"     Id. at 107 (citing Vaughan v. Atkinson, 369\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fU.S. 527, 531 (1962). However, treatment that is \"more than simply\n\npalliative, and would improve [the seaman's] medical condition\n\n. . . is enough to support an award of maintenance and cure in aid\n\nof permanent improvement short of a complete cure.\"           Id.\n\n            1.   Whether MS Can Be Improved Through Treatment\n\n            Whitman first argues that the district court erred in\n\nfinding that MS is incapable of being improved through treatment.\n\nWhitman bases this argument on the fact that she is being treated\n\nwith Betaseron, a disease-modifying drug that acts at the cellular\n\nlevel to alter the immune system's response to MS.        Whitman states\n\nthat the goals of her treatment include slowing, stabilizing,\n\narresting, or reversing her MS symptoms.        Relying on our decision\n\nin In re RJF, Whitman argues that this treatment is not palliative\n\nand will improve her medical condition.\n\n            Whitman's reliance on In re RJF is misplaced.           In that\n\ncase,   a   seaman   suffered   severe,   permanent   brain   damage   with\n\nsymptoms including muscle spasticity and contractions. Id. at 106.\n\nThe seaman's physicians provided evidence that further treatment,\n\nincluding rehabilitation directed in part at the muscle spasms,\n\nwould lessen the muscle ailments and result in further, although\n\nincomplete, cognitive improvement.          Id. at 107.       Because the\n\nevidence showed that further treatment would improve the seaman's\n\nunderlying condition, we found that the seaman had not reached the\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\fpoint of maximum medical recovery and that the shipowner's duty of\n\nmaintenance and cure continued.          Id.\n\n           In the instant case, Whitman concedes that her MS is\n\npermanent.      The question is whether Whitman's treatment would\n\nimprove   her      medical   condition   such   that   she   had   not,   as   of\n\nAugust 15, 2000, reached the point of maximum medical recovery.\n\nThe testimony of the doctors for both parties leaves no genuine\n\nissue of material fact that Whitman's treatment would, at best,\n\nslow or arrest the progression of her MS, but would not reverse her\n\nsymptoms or improve her condition beyond the point of maximum\n\nmedical recovery.\n\n             Dr.    Richard    Tenser,   Whitman's     treating     physician,\n\ntestified in his deposition that Whitman's condition had not\n\nimproved and had probably worsened.4            Dr. Tenser's testimony also\n\nindicated that, at best, he hoped treatment with Betaseron would\n\nslow or arrest the progression of Whitman's MS to prevent her from\n\nbecoming disabled:\n\n             Q.     Would you agree with me that it is more\n             likely than not that Ms. Whitman will at some\n             point in the future become disabled from her\n             MS?\n\n             A.     Again, a tough question.           I mean the\n             whole goal of her treatment is            to try to\n             prevent that. . .[S]he has pretty         severe MS.\n             Whether she will become disabled           or not, I\n\n\n4\n  While Dr. Tenser discussed improvement, he did so in the context\nof improvement from Whitman's last exacerbation, not improvement in\nher overall condition.\n\n                                     -8-\n\f           don't know. Obviously using the Betaseron to\n           try to prevent that, so do I want to\n           acknowledge that the medication will fail, I'm\n           reluctant to do that. I would just say that\n           she certainly has a significant chance of\n           becoming disabled.\n\n             Moreover, Whitman mentions several times that one of the\n\ngoals of her treatment is to reverse her symptoms.                           However,\n\nDr. Tenser never testified that this was the goal of her treatment.\n\nMiles's medical expert, Dr. Edward Collins, mentioned \"reversing\"\n\nsome of Whitman's symptoms in his deposition testimony, but not\n\nreversing the MS itself. Further, Dr. Collins noted that, while he\n\nhoped that treatment might reverse certain symptoms of MS, he was\n\nnot predicting that result.         He also later testified that the goal\n\nof her treatment was to slow the downward progression of Whitman's\n\nMS, and that an upward improvement would not occur.\n\n             The testimony of both doctors is very different from In\n\nre RJF, where the seaman's doctors opined that further treatment\n\nwould not merely arrest symptoms of the underlying condition, but\n\nwould improve the condition itself.            Id.        Further, in In re RJF,\n\nthe   testimony    of    the   shipowner's     doctors      left   room      for   the\n\nconclusion      that    further    treatment       could    lead   to     long-term\n\nimprovement of the seaman's condition.              Id.     In the instant case,\n\nDr.   Collins     explicitly      stated    that     no     reversal    or    upward\n\nimprovement in Whitman's condition would occur.\n\n           In sum, while Whitman's treatment may be necessary and\n\nbeneficial to her, its benefits relate to slowing or arresting the\n\n                                      -9-\n\fprogression of her disease.              We agree with the district court that\n\n\"[s]lowing or arresting a decline, while medically important,\n\nsimply is not the same as effecting an improvement . . . .\"\n\nWhitman, 294 F. Supp. 2d at 123.\n\n           2.    August 15, 2000\n\n           Whitman also argues that the district court erred in\n\nfinding that she was as improved as possible on August 15, 2000.\n\nAccording to Whitman, the district court should not have found that\n\nshe was as improved as possible on August 15, 2000, because nothing\n\nin the medical record at that time mentioned her condition as being\n\npermanent, she had not yet begun her treatment with Betaseron, and\n\nshe was later asymptomatic on November 17, 2000.\n\n           While       it    may    be     true    that    the     medical      record   on\n\nAugust 15, 2000 says nothing about Whitman's condition being\n\npermanent, it is        undisputed that Whitman had been diagnosed with\n\nMS by August 15, 2000.         By definition, MS is a permanent, incurable\n\ndisease.      There     was    no    need    for    a     doctor    to    use    the   word\n\n\"permanent\"     when    Whitman's          condition      was,     by    definition      and\n\nconcededly, permanent.\n\n           Regarding         the    fact    that    Whitman      had     not    yet    begun\n\ntreatment with Betaseron on August 15, 2000, both medical experts\n\ntestified that the goal of the Betaseron was to slow or arrest the\n\nprogression of MS.          There is no evidence that the goal or even the\n\n\n\n\n                                           -10-\n\fhope of the Betaseron treatment was to improve Whitman's condition\n\nbeyond where it was on August 15, 2000.\n\n           Finally, although Whitman was diagnosed in November 2000\n\nas asymptomatic, this diagnosis was made in the context of the most\n\nrecent    exacerbation    of     her    relapsing-remitting       MS.5      Her\n\nasymptomatic status on that date does not mean that her overall\n\ncondition had improved, but merely that the symptoms from her last\n\nexacerbation had died down.\n\n           Whitman first experienced symptoms in mid-July 2000 and\n\nhad to be hospitalized.        On August 15, 2000, Dr. Weiner found that\n\nthese symptoms had \"resolved,\" and Whitman began her treatment\n\nshortly   thereafter.      Whitman's          medical   expert,   Dr.    Tenser,\n\ntestified that Whitman has not improved during the course of her\n\ntreatment.    We therefore conclude that Whitman's condition has not\n\nimproved since August 15, 2000, and that date thus represents a\n\ndate when Whitman reached the point of maximum medical recovery.\n\n             3.   Depression\n\n           Whitman also argues that she suffers from depression as\n\na result of her MS, and that because her depression is curable, she\n\nis entitled to maintenance and cure for its treatment.                      The\n\ndistrict court did not determine whether Whitman is arguing that\n\n\n\n5\n    According to Whitman's physician Dr. Tenser, in relapsing-\nremitting MS, a patient has exacerbations when \"[n]eurologic\nsymptoms occur, [that] once again may clear completely or may clear\nincompletely.\"\n\n                                       -11-\n\fher depression is a symptom of MS or is a separate ailment, instead\n\nfinding that Whitman would not be entitled to maintenance and cure\n\nregardless of which argument she was making.             We agree.6\n\n           If    Whitman's   argument     is   that    her    depression     is   a\n\ndistinct ailment from her MS, giving rise to its own claim for\n\nmaintenance and cure, then she has failed to produce any evidence\n\nthat she began to suffer from depression while in the service of\n\nthe ship, an element on which she would have the burden of proof at\n\ntrial.     See    Celotex    Corp.   v.     Catrett,    477    U.S.   317,    322\n\n(1986)(\"[T]he plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of\n\nsummary judgment . . . against a party who fails to make a showing\n\nsufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to\n\nthat party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of\n\nproof at trial.\").\n\n           The alterative argument that Whitman's depression is a\n\nsymptom of her MS would not alter her eligibility for maintenance\n\nand cure. Our conclusion that August 15, 2000 is the date she\n\nreached maximum medical recovery precludes her from maintenance and\n\ncure benefits.    Whitman has produced no evidence that she suffered\n\nfrom depression as a symptom of her MS on or before August 15,\n\n2000.

Consultation of Whitman's Physician\n\n          Whitman's final argument is that maintenance and cure\n\nshould have continued until her physicians declared her condition\n\npermanent.        See   Vella   v.   Ford    Motor   Co.,   421   U.S.   1,   4-5\n\n(1975)(holding that maintenance and cure continues until a seaman's\n\ninjury is medically diagnosed as permanent); Hubbard v. Faros\n\nFisheries, Inc., 626 F.2d 196, 202 (1st Cir. 1980)(concluding that\n\na seaman \"was entitled to maintenance and cure until his physicians\n\ndiagnosed his condition as permanent\"). According to Whitman,\n\nMiles's insurance representative, Patrick O'Toole, terminated her\n\nmaintenance and cure benefits prior to consulting her physicians\n\nand without any evidence that Whitman's MS was permanent and\n\nincapable of being improved.         Whitman argues that the earliest the\n\ndiagnosis of permanency could have occurred was July 30, 2003, when\n\nMiles deposed her doctor.\n\n             In Vella, the Supreme Court quoted with approval a Second\n\nCircuit decision stating that \"[t]he shipowner is liable for\n\nmaintenance and cure only until the disease is cured or recognized\n\nas incurable.\"      Vella v. United States, 421 U.S. at 6 n.5 (quoting\n\n\n\n7\n   We do not address whether curing Whitman's depression would\neffectuate an improvement in her MS because it is clear that, even\nif this were the case, Whitman's condition would not improve beyond\nwhere it was on August 15, 2000.\n\n                                      -13-\n\fDesmond   v.

In the instant case, it is undisputed that, as\n\nof August 15, 2000, Whitman was diagnosed by her physicians as\n\nhaving MS, a disease that is by definition recognized as permanent\n\nand incurable.8       In this situation, we do not believe that a\n\nphysician must use the magic words \"permanent\" or \"incapable of\n\nbeing improved\" in a diagnosis.           We agree with the district court\n\nthat such a requirement \"would elevate form over substance.\"\n\nWhitman, 294 F. Supp. 2d at 124.            By August 15, 2000, Whitman had\n\nbeen diagnosed by her physicians with MS, a condition that is\n\nrecognized as incurable. Miles's obligation to provide maintenance\n\nand cure therefore ended by August 15, 2000.\n\nB.   Attorney's Fees\n\n              At trial, Whitman would have the burden of proving that\n\nMiles   was    \"callous,   willful,    or    recalcitrant\"    in    withholding\n\nmaintenance and cure payments.           See Robinson v. Pocahontas, Inc.,\n\n477 F.2d 1048, 1051 (1st Cir. 1973).          The district court found that\n\nMiles's refusal to pay maintenance and cure beyond the date of\n\nWhitman's diagnosis was not callous, willful, or recalcitrant. See\n\nWhitman, 294 F. Supp. 2d at 125.          Whitman argues that the district\n\ncourt erred because it failed to determine what Miles's insurance\n\nadjuster knew about MS, and from what source, when it terminated\n\n\n8\n   We note again that there is no dispute about whether MS is\npermanent because Whitman herself concedes that MS is a permanent\ndisease.\n\n                                      -14-\n\fWhitman's maintenance and cure benefits in August 2000.9         Whitman\n\nasks us to remand Count II for a factual determination on this\n\npoint.   However, it is Whitman who bears the burden at summary\n\njudgment of producing evidence that Miles was \"callous, willful, or\n\nrecalcitrant\"   in   denying   her   maintenance   and   cure   benefits.\n\nWhitman has produced no such evidence, and we therefore affirm the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment on Count II.               See\n\nCelotex Corp., 477 U.S. at 322-23.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n9\n   This argument appears to be based on a belief that, if the\ndistrict court found that Miles's insurer had not consulted\nWhitman's doctors or made a thorough examination of Whitman's\nmedical records before terminating maintenance and cure, then Miles\nwould have been callous, willful, or recalcitrant.\n\n                                 -15-\n\f",

Cellexis Int'l, Inc.,</i> 341 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2003). Summary judgment is appropriate \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed. R.Civ.P. 56(c).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On July 17, 2000, while working as a cook on Miles's ship, the <i>S/V Timberland,</i> Whitman had to be driven to a hospital after falling several times on the ship, burning herself while cooking, and experiencing other symptoms including fatigue, cold, numbness, and incontinence. Following an MRI, Whitman was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (\"MS\"), an autoimmune disease that causes a person's immune system to attack healthy tissue in the body. Whitman has what is known as \"relapsing-remitting\" MS, which is characterized by symptoms that manifest themselves in sporadic, unpredictable exacerbations that flare up and then die down. Sometimes the symptoms completely clear; other times they do not. While not fatal, MS is a permanent disease with no known cure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 3, 2000, Whitman saw Dr. Judd Jensen for a follow-up visit. Dr. Jensen noted significant improvement in Whitman's status since her hospital visit on July 17, 2000. Dr. Jensen also reiterated that the MRI findings were strongly suggestive of MS. On August 15, 2000, Whitman saw Dr. Howard Weiner for an evaluation. Dr. Weiner, an MS specialist, described Whitman's initial symptoms and MRI as classic for MS. After a neurologic examination, Dr. Weiner found that Whitman had a normal gait and there were no other motor, cerebellar, or sensory findings. He also found that Whitman was continent and only had some mild tingling feelings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after Dr. Weiner's August 15 evaluation, Whitman began taking Betaseron, a disease-modifying medication that acts at the cellular level to alter the immune system's response to MS. On October 4, 2000, Whitman saw Dr. Jensen and complained of numbness and loss of balance. On November 17, 2000, Whitman again visited Dr. Jensen, who noted that the recent exacerbation had resolved in a couple of days, that her neurologic examination was essentially normal, and that she was asymptomatic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since July 2000, Whitman has had several exacerbations, with symptoms including vision problems, memory loss, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, numbness, leg spasms, partial paralysis to one side of her face, and foot drop. Some, but not all, of these symptoms have faded or disappeared. Whitman's last exacerbation occurred in November 2002. Whitman also suffers from depression, for which she takes medication. Depression is common among patients with MS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through his insurer, Miles paid Whitman's medical bills for her initial diagnosis and treatment. Miles did not pay for any living expenses or treatment after the diagnosis. In August 2000, Whitman spoke by phone with Patrick O'Toole of Acadia Insurance Company, which is Miles's insurer, and requested maintenance and cure benefits. In a letter dated August 21, 2000, Acadia denied Whitman benefits beyond the emergency treatment and initial diagnosis. On March 6, 2003, Whitman filed suit in Maine federal district court, seeking past and ongoing maintenance and cure (\"Count I\"), as well as attorney's fees for unreasonable refusal to pay maintenance and cure (\"Count II\"). On August 28, 2003, Miles moved for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miles originally argued that his duty to provide maintenance and cure ended on July 18, 2000, when Whitman was first diagnosed with MS. At oral argument before the district court, Miles conceded that the duty to provide maintenance and cure extended for a short time after diagnosis, and agreed to pay for Whitman's medical expenses up to August 15, 2000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On November 20, 2003, the district court partially granted Miles's motion for summary judgment on Count I, finding that August 15, 2000 was the date of maximum medical recovery. The district court concluded that Miles was entitled to summary judgment for \"all maintenance and cure after August 15, 2000, and for lodging expenses in their entirety.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>Whitman v.

Whitman bases this argument on the fact that she is being treated with Betaseron, a disease-modifying drug that acts at the cellular level to alter the immune system's response to MS. Whitman states that the goals of her treatment include slowing, stabilizing, arresting, or reversing her MS symptoms. Relying on our decision in <i>In re RJF,</i> Whitman argues that this treatment is not palliative and will improve her medical condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitman's reliance on <i>In re RJF</i> is misplaced. In that case, a seaman suffered severe, permanent brain damage with symptoms including muscle spasticity and contractions. <i>Id.</i> at 106. The seaman's physicians provided evidence that further treatment, including rehabilitation directed in part at the muscle spasms, would lessen the muscle ailments <i>and</i> result in further, although incomplete, cognitive improvement. <i>Id.</i> at 107. Because the evidence showed that further treatment would improve the seaman's underlying condition, we found that the seaman had not reached the point of maximum medical recovery and that the shipowner's duty of maintenance and cure continued. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, Whitman concedes that her MS is permanent. The question is whether Whitman's treatment would improve her medical condition such that she had not, as of August 15, 2000, reached the point of maximum medical recovery. The testimony of the doctors for both parties leaves no genuine issue of material fact that Whitman's treatment would, at best, slow or arrest the progression of her MS, but would not reverse her symptoms or improve her condition beyond the point of maximum medical recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Richard Tenser, Whitman's treating physician, testified in his deposition that Whitman's condition had not improved and had probably worsened.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Dr. Tenser's testimony also indicated that, at best, he hoped treatment with Betaseron would slow or arrest the progression of Whitman's MS to prevent her from becoming disabled:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Would you agree with me that it is more likely than not that Ms. Whitman will at some point in the future become disabled from her MS? A. Again, a tough question. I mean the whole goal of her treatment is to try to prevent that...[S]he has pretty severe MS. Whether she will become disabled or not, I don't know. Obviously using the Betaseron to try to prevent that, so do I want to acknowledge that the medication will fail, I'm reluctant to do that. I would just say that she certainly has a significant chance of becoming disabled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Whitman mentions several times that one of the goals of her treatment is to reverse her symptoms. However, Dr. Tenser never testified that this was the goal of her treatment. Miles's medical expert, Dr. Edward Collins, mentioned \"reversing\" some of Whitman's symptoms in his deposition testimony, but not reversing the MS itself. Further, Dr. Collins noted that, while he hoped that treatment might reverse certain symptoms of MS, he was not predicting that result. He also later testified that the goal of her treatment was to slow the downward progression of Whitman's MS, and that an upward improvement would not occur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony of both doctors is very different from <i>In re RJF,</i> where the seaman's doctors opined that further treatment would not merely arrest symptoms of the underlying condition, but would improve the condition itself. <i>Id.</i> Further, in <i>In re RJF,</i> the testimony of the shipowner's doctors left room for the conclusion that further treatment could lead to long-term improvement of the seaman's condition. <i>Id.</i> In the instant case, Dr. Collins explicitly stated that no reversal or upward improvement in Whitman's condition would occur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, while Whitman's treatment may be necessary and beneficial to her, its benefits relate to slowing or arresting the progression of her disease. We agree with the district court that \"[s]lowing or arresting a decline, while medically important, simply is not the same as effecting an improvement....\" <i>Whitman,</i> 294 F.Supp.2d at 123.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>August 15, 2000</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitman also argues that the district court erred in finding that she was as improved as possible on August 15, 2000. According to Whitman, the district court should not have found that she was as improved as possible on August 15, 2000, because nothing in the medical record at that time mentioned her condition as being permanent, she had not yet begun her treatment with Betaseron, and she was later asymptomatic on November 17, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it may be true that the medical record on August 15, 2000 says nothing about Whitman's condition being permanent, it is undisputed that Whitman had been diagnosed with MS by August 15, 2000. By definition, MS is a permanent, incurable disease. There was no need for a doctor to use the word \"permanent\" when Whitman's condition was, by definition and concededly, permanent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the fact that Whitman had not yet begun treatment with Betaseron on August 15, 2000, both medical experts testified that the goal of the Betaseron was to slow or arrest the progression of MS. There is no evidence that the goal or even the hope of the Betaseron treatment was to improve Whitman's condition beyond where it was on August 15, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, although Whitman was diagnosed in November 2000 as asymptomatic, this diagnosis was made in the context of the most recent exacerbation of her relapsing-remitting MS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Her asymptomatic status on that date does not mean that her overall condition had improved, but merely that the symptoms from her last exacerbation had died down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitman first experienced symptoms in mid-July 2000 and had to be hospitalized. On August 15, 2000, Dr. Weiner found that these symptoms had \"resolved,\" and Whitman began her treatment shortly thereafter. Whitman's medical expert, Dr. Tenser, testified that Whitman has not improved during the course of her treatment. We therefore conclude that Whitman's condition has not improved since August 15, 2000, and that date thus represents a date when Whitman reached the point of maximum medical recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Depression</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitman also argues that she suffers from depression as a result of her MS, and that because her depression is curable, she is entitled to maintenance and cure for its treatment. The district court did not determine whether Whitman is arguing that her depression is a symptom of MS or is a separate ailment, instead finding that Whitman would not be entitled to maintenance and cure regardless of which argument she was making. We agree.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Whitman's argument is that her depression is a distinct ailment from her MS, giving rise to its own claim for maintenance and cure, then she has failed to produce any evidence that she began to suffer from depression while in the service of the ship, an element on which she would have the burden of proof at trial. <i>See Celotex Corp. v. Catrett,</i> 477 U.S. 317, 322, 106 S.Ct. 2548, 91 L.Ed.2d 265 (1986) (\"[T]he plain language of Rule 56(c) mandates the entry of summary judgment ... against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence of an element essential to that party's case, and on which that party will bear the burden of proof at trial.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The alternative argument that Whitman's depression is a symptom of her MS would not alter her eligibility for maintenance and cure. Our conclusion that August 15, 2000 is the date she reached maximum medical recovery precludes her from maintenance and cure benefits. Whitman has produced no evidence that she suffered from depression as a symptom of her MS on or before August 15, 2000. Even assuming that her depression could be cured, it would not improve her condition beyond where it was on August 15, 2000, when she was not suffering from depression.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Consultation of Whitman's Physician</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitman's final argument is that maintenance and cure should have continued until her physicians declared her condition permanent. <i>See Vella v. Ford Motor Co.,</i> 421 U.S. 1, 4-5, 95 S.Ct. 1381, 43 L.Ed.2d 682 (1975) (holding that maintenance and cure continues until a seaman's injury is medically diagnosed as permanent); <i>Hubbard v. Faros Fisheries, Inc.,</i> 626 F.2d 196, 202 (1st Cir.1980) (concluding that a seaman \"was entitled to maintenance and cure until his physicians diagnosed his condition as permanent\"). According to Whitman, Miles's insurance representative, Patrick O'Toole, terminated her maintenance and cure benefits prior to consulting her physicians and without any evidence that Whitman's MS was permanent and incapable of being improved. Whitman argues that the earliest the diagnosis of permanency could have occurred was July 30, 2003, when Miles deposed her doctor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Vella,</i> the Supreme Court quoted with approval a Second Circuit decision stating that \"[t]he shipowner is liable for maintenance and cure only until the disease is cured <i>or recognized as incurable.</i>\" <i>Vella v. Ford Motor,</i> 421 U.S. at 6 n. 5, 95 S.Ct. 1381 (quoting <i>Desmond v. United States,</i> 217 F.2d 948, 950 (2d Cir.1954) (emphasis added)). In the instant case, it is undisputed that, as of August 15, 2000, Whitman was diagnosed by her physicians as having MS, a disease that is by definition recognized as permanent and incurable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> In this situation, we do not believe that a physician must use the magic words \"permanent\" or \"incapable of being improved\" in a diagnosis. We agree with the district court that such a requirement \"would elevate form over substance.\" <i>Whitman,</i> 294 F.Supp.2d at 124.

The district court found that Miles's refusal to pay maintenance and cure beyond the date of Whitman's diagnosis was not callous, willful, or recalcitrant. <i>See Whitman,</i> 294 F.Supp.2d at 125. Whitman argues that the district court erred because it failed to determine what Miles's insurance adjuster knew about MS, and from what source, when it terminated Whitman's maintenance and cure benefits in August 2000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Whitman asks us to remand Count II for a factual determination on this point.

Following an MRI, Whitman was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (\"MS\"), an autoimmune disease that causes a person's immune system to attack healthy tissue in the body. Whitman has what is known as \"relapsing-remitting\" MS, which is characterized by symptoms that manifest themselves in sporadic, unpredictable exacerbations that flare up and then die down. Sometimes the symptoms completely clear; other times they do not. While not fatal, MS is a permanent disease with no known cure.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On August 3, 2000, Whitman saw Dr. Judd Jensen for a follow-up visit. Dr. Jensen noted significant improvement in Whitman's status since her hospital visit on July 17, 2000. Dr. Jensen also reiterated that the MRI findings were strongly suggestive of MS. On August 15, 2000, Whitman saw Dr. Howard Weiner for an evaluation. Dr. Weiner, an MS specialist, described Whitman's initial symptoms and MRI as classic for MS. After a neurologic examination, Dr. Weiner found that Whitman had a normal gait and there were no other motor, cerebellar, or sensory findings. He also found that Whitman was continent and only had some mild tingling feelings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Shortly after Dr. Weiner's August 15 evaluation, Whitman began taking Betaseron, a disease-modifying medication that acts at the cellular level to alter the immune system's response to MS. On October 4, 2000, Whitman saw Dr. Jensen and complained of numbness and loss of balance. On November 17, 2000, Whitman again visited Dr. Jensen, who noted that the recent exacerbation had resolved in a couple of days, that her neurologic examination was essentially normal, and that she was asymptomatic.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since July 2000, Whitman has had several exacerbations, with symptoms including vision problems, memory loss, dizziness, lightheadedness, nausea, vomiting, numbness, leg spasms, partial paralysis to one side of her face, and foot drop. Some, but not all, of these symptoms have faded or disappeared. Whitman's last exacerbation occurred in November 2002. Whitman also suffers from depression, for which she takes medication. Depression is common among patients with MS.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through his insurer, Miles paid Whitman's medical bills for her initial diagnosis and treatment. Miles did not pay for any living expenses or treatment after the diagnosis. In August 2000, Whitman spoke by phone with Patrick O'Toole of Acadia Insurance Company, which is Miles's insurer, and requested maintenance and cure benefits. In a letter dated August 21, 2000, Acadia denied Whitman benefits beyond the emergency treatment and initial diagnosis. On March 6, 2003, Whitman filed suit in Maine federal district court, seeking past and ongoing maintenance and cure (\"Count I\"), as well as attorney's fees for unreasonable refusal to pay maintenance and cure (\"Count II\"). On August 28, 2003, Miles moved for summary judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Miles originally argued that his duty to provide maintenance and cure ended on July 18, 2000, when Whitman was first diagnosed with MS. At oral argument before the district court, Miles conceded that the duty to provide maintenance and cure extended for a short time after diagnosis, and agreed to pay for Whitman's medical expenses up to August 15, 2000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> On November 20, 2003, the district court partially granted Miles's motion for summary judgment on Count I, finding that August 15, 2000 was the date of maximum medical recovery.

Whitman bases this argument on the fact that she is being treated with Betaseron, a disease-modifying drug that acts at the cellular level to alter the immune system's response to MS. Whitman states that the goals of her treatment include slowing, stabilizing, arresting, or reversing her MS symptoms. Relying on our decision in <i>In re RJF,</i> Whitman argues that this treatment is not palliative and will improve her medical condition.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitman's reliance on <i>In re RJF</i> is misplaced. In that case, a seaman suffered severe, permanent brain damage with symptoms including muscle spasticity and contractions. <i>Id.</i> at 106. The seaman's physicians provided evidence that further treatment, including rehabilitation directed in part at the muscle spasms, would lessen the muscle ailments <i>and</i> result in further, although incomplete, cognitive improvement. <i>Id.</i> at 107. Because the evidence showed that further treatment would improve the seaman's underlying condition, we found that the seaman had not reached the point of maximum medical recovery and that the shipowner's duty of maintenance and cure continued. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the instant case, Whitman concedes that her MS is permanent. The question is whether Whitman's treatment would improve her medical condition such that she had not, as of August 15, 2000, reached the point of maximum medical recovery. The testimony of the doctors for both parties leaves no genuine issue of material fact that Whitman's treatment would, at best, slow or arrest the progression of her MS, but would not reverse her symptoms or improve her condition beyond the point of maximum medical recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Dr. Richard Tenser, Whitman's treating physician, testified in his deposition that Whitman's condition had not improved and had probably worsened.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Dr. Tenser's testimony also indicated that, at best, he hoped treatment with Betaseron would slow or arrest the progression of Whitman's MS to prevent her from becoming disabled:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. Would you agree with me that it is more likely than not that Ms. Whitman will at some point in the future become disabled from her MS? A. Again, a tough question. I mean the whole goal of her treatment is to try to prevent that...[S]he has pretty severe MS. Whether she will become disabled or not, I don't know. Obviously using the Betaseron to try to prevent that, so do I want to acknowledge that the medication will fail, I'm reluctant to do that. I would just say that she certainly has a significant chance of becoming disabled.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Whitman mentions several times that one of the goals of her treatment is to reverse her symptoms. However, Dr. Tenser never testified that this was the goal of her treatment. Miles's medical expert, Dr. Edward Collins, mentioned \"reversing\" some of Whitman's symptoms in his deposition testimony, but not reversing the MS itself. Further, Dr. Collins noted that, while he hoped that treatment might reverse certain symptoms of MS, he was not predicting that result. He also later testified that the goal of her treatment was to slow the downward progression of Whitman's MS, and that an upward improvement would not occur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The testimony of both doctors is very different from <i>In re RJF,</i> where the seaman's doctors opined that further treatment would not merely arrest symptoms of the underlying condition, but would improve the condition itself. <i>Id.</i> Further, in <i>In re RJF,</i> the testimony of the shipowner's doctors left room for the conclusion that further treatment could lead to long-term improvement of the seaman's condition. <i>Id.</i> In the instant case, Dr. Collins explicitly stated that no reversal or upward improvement in Whitman's condition would occur.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, while Whitman's treatment may be necessary and beneficial to her, its benefits relate to slowing or arresting the progression of her disease. We agree with the district court that \"[s]lowing or arresting a decline, while medically important, simply is not the same as effecting an improvement....\" <i>Whitman,</i> 294 F.Supp.2d at 123.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>August 15, 2000</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitman also argues that the district court erred in finding that she was as improved as possible on August 15, 2000. According to Whitman, the district court should not have found that she was as improved as possible on August 15, 2000, because nothing in the medical record at that time mentioned her condition as being permanent, she had not yet begun her treatment with Betaseron, and she was later asymptomatic on November 17, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it may be true that the medical record on August 15, 2000 says nothing about Whitman's condition being permanent, it is undisputed that Whitman had been diagnosed with MS by August 15, 2000. By definition, MS is a permanent, incurable disease. There was no need for a doctor to use the word \"permanent\" when Whitman's condition was, by definition and concededly, permanent.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding the fact that Whitman had not yet begun treatment with Betaseron on August 15, 2000, both medical experts testified that the goal of the Betaseron was to slow or arrest the progression of MS. There is no evidence that the goal or even the hope of the Betaseron treatment was to improve Whitman's condition beyond where it was on August 15, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, although Whitman was diagnosed in November 2000 as asymptomatic, this diagnosis was made in the context of the most recent exacerbation of her relapsing-remitting MS.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Her asymptomatic status on that date does not mean that her overall condition had improved, but merely that the symptoms from her last exacerbation had died down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitman first experienced symptoms in mid-July 2000 and had to be hospitalized. On August 15, 2000, Dr. Weiner found that these symptoms had \"resolved,\" and Whitman began her treatment shortly thereafter. Whitman's medical expert, Dr. Tenser, testified that Whitman has not improved during the course of her treatment. We therefore conclude that Whitman's condition has not improved since August 15, 2000, and that date thus represents a date when Whitman reached the point of maximum medical recovery.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Depression</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whitman also argues that she suffers from depression as a result of her MS, and that because her depression is curable, she is entitled to maintenance and cure for its treatment. The district court did not determine whether Whitman is arguing that her depression is a symptom of MS or is a separate ailment, instead finding that Whitman would not be entitled to maintenance and cure regardless of which argument she was making.

Our conclusion that August 15, 2000 is the date she reached maximum medical recovery precludes her from maintenance and cure benefits. Whitman has produced no evidence that she suffered from depression as a symptom of her MS on or before August 15, 2000.

According to Whitman, Miles's insurance representative, Patrick O'Toole, terminated her maintenance and cure benefits prior to consulting her physicians and without any evidence that Whitman's MS was permanent and incapable of being improved. Whitman argues that the earliest the diagnosis of permanency could have occurred was July 30, 2003, when Miles deposed her doctor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Vella,</i> the Supreme Court quoted with approval a Second Circuit decision stating that \"[t]he shipowner is liable for maintenance and cure only until the disease is cured <i>or recognized as incurable.</i>\" <i>Vella v.

In the instant case, it is undisputed that, as of August 15, 2000, Whitman was diagnosed by her physicians as having MS, a disease that is by definition recognized as permanent and incurable.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> In this situation, we do not believe that a physician must use the magic words \"permanent\" or \"incapable of being improved\" in a diagnosis. We agree with the district court that such a requirement \"would elevate form over substance.\" <i>Whitman,</i> 294 F.Supp.2d at 124. By August 15, 2000, Whitman had been diagnosed by her physicians with MS, a condition that is recognized as incurable. Miles's obligation to provide maintenance and cure therefore ended by August 15, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

The district court found that Miles's refusal to pay maintenance and cure beyond the date of Whitman's diagnosis was not callous, willful, or recalcitrant. <i>See Whitman,</i> 294 F.Supp.2d at 125. Whitman argues that the district court erred because it failed to determine what Miles's insurance adjuster knew about MS, and from what source, when it terminated Whitman's maintenance and cure benefits in August 2000.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> Whitman asks us to remand Count II for a factual determination on this point. However, it is Whitman who bears the burden at summary judgment of producing evidence that Miles was \"callous, willful, or recalcitrant\" in denying her maintenance and cure benefits. Whitman has produced no such evidence, and we therefore affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment on Count II. <i>See Celotex Corp.,</i> 477 U.S. at 322-23, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111722\"><a href=\"/opinion/111722/celotex-corporation-v-myrtle-nell-catrett-administratrix-of-the-estate-of/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In its decision, the district court noted that the standard in <i>Calmar</i> was superceded by the Shipowner's Liability Convention and found that under the Convention maintenance and cure benefits continue until the sailor is \"so far cured as possible\". <i>Farrell v.
