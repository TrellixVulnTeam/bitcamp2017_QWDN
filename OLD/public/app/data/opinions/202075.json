This is an appeal and cross appeal\n\nof the district court's resolution, on remand from this court, of\n\ncompeting claims to a 42-foot motorized yacht, known variously as\n\nthe Lady B, the Lady B Gone, and the Cent'Anni (the vessel).              The\n\nvessel's owners, David and Joan Mullane, appeal the district\n\ncourt's rejection of their claim to a lien on the vessel.             Adele\n\nChambers and Jean Farese, who seized the vessel to satisfy debts of\n\nthe vessel's previous owner, appeal the district court's order that\n\nthey reimburse the Mullanes for storing the vessel during the\n\ncourse of the litigation.     We affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n           The facts have been recounted elsewhere.           This case has\n\nbeen tried twice, by two different district court judges, each of\n\nwhom published an opinion.        Mullane v. Chambers, 349 F. Supp. 2d\n\n190 (D. Mass. 2004); Mullane v. Chambers, 206 F. Supp. 2d 105 (D.\n\nMass. 2002).     It has been the subject of a published opinion by\n\nthis court.    Mullane v. Chambers, 333 F.3d 322 (1st Cir. 2003).          We\n\nreview only the details relevant to the issues before us.           Because\n\nthis case comes to us after a trial, we present the facts in the\n\nlight most favorable to the district court's judgment.           See Wilson\n\nv. Mar. Overseas Corp., 150 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n           In July 1998, the Mullanes bought the vessel from a trust\n\nestablished by Dr. David Murphy and his wife.            As consideration,\n\nthe   Mullanes   paid   $98,117   to    Eastern   Bank   to   discharge   the\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fpreferred ship's mortgage on the vessel in favor of the bank,1 paid\n\n$2,000 cash to Murphy and assumed a $40,000 lien Murphy owed to his\n\nown company.\n\n           The vessel was federally documented and listed on the\n\nregistry maintained by the United States Coast Guard.2                     In the\n\nnormal course of maritime affairs, transfer of the vessel and\n\ndischarge of the mortgage should have been recorded immediately\n\nwith the Coast Guard, in which case the public record would have\n\nshown that the Mullanes, not the Murphys, owned the vessel.                      46\n\nU.S.C. §§ 12101-12124, 31321.         For whatever reason, however, the\n\nsale and discharge were not recorded until September.                     In the\n\ninterim   --   for    all   of   August     --   the   public    record    showed\n\nerroneously    that   the   Murphys   owned      the   vessel,   subject    to   a\n\nmortgage in favor of Eastern Bank.\n\n           At the time he sold the vessel to the Mullanes, David\n\nMurphy was indebted to Chambers and Farese, both of whom had loaned\n\nhim money.     Chambers had obtained a $70,132 writ of execution\n\n\n\n1\n  A preferred ship's mortgage is a statutorily-created lien that\ncan be publicly registered, see infra note 2, and can be enforced\nin an admiralty court. See 46 U.S.C. § 31322 et seq.\n2\n  The Coast Guard maintains a \"national form of registration\" for\nvessels larger than five net tons. Vessels like the one involved\nin this case, larger than five net tons but not involved in any\ncommercial enterprise, may be registered at the option of the\nowner. See 46 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq. See also National Vessel\nDocumentation    Center:   Frequently    Asked   Questions,    at\nhttp://www.uscg.mil/hq/g-m/vdoc/faq.htm (last visited Jan. 24,\n2006).\n\n                                      -3-\n\fagainst Murphy, and Farese a writ for $27,612.                  But neither\n\nChambers nor Farese had attached any claim to the vessel until late\n\nAugust, when, acting on the information in the public record, they\n\narranged for sheriff's deputies to seize the vessel.\n\n             Chambers and Farese learned about the transfer from the\n\nMurphys to the Mullanes and the mortgage discharge hours after the\n\nseizure.     Nonetheless, they elected to press their claim to the\n\nvessel rather than attempt to satisfy Murphy's debt with property\n\nthat actually belonged to him.          Indeed -- according to their own\n\nstatements -- upon learning that the Eastern Bank mortgage on the\n\nvessel had been discharged, Chambers and Farese abandoned their\n\nplans to seize Murphy's condominium, which they also had arranged\n\nfor the sheriff's deputies to levy.                 They believed that the\n\nadditional equity in the vessel available after the mortgage\n\ndischarge     would     make   any   seizure   of   Murphy's   own    property\n\nunnecessary.\n\n             The Mullanes sued Farese, Chambers, and the Sheriff's\n\nDepartment that had seized the vessel.               They claimed that the\n\nseizure had been illegal, that they were entitled to unencumbered\n\nownership of the vessel, and that they were owed compensation for\n\ndamage to the vessel that occurred during the seizure.               The case\n\nlanded on the admiralty docket of the district court. See Mullane,\n\n333   F.3d   at   328   (concluding    admiralty    jurisdiction     correctly\n\ninvoked). The Mullanes arranged for the vessel to be arrested, see\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fFed. R. Civ. P. D, an action that prevented anyone from selling the\n\nvessel before litigation concluded. Initially, the vessel was held\n\nby the court.       At some relatively early point, however, the\n\nMullanes posted a $125,000 passbook savings account as security for\n\nthe vessel, and it was released to their custody.            See Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. E(5)(d).\n\n            After the first trial in this case, the district court\n\nfound that the Mullanes were bona-fide purchasers of the vessel who\n\nhad no notice of Chambers and Farese's claims.                The court also\n\nconcluded   that   the   seizure   of   the   vessel   was    improper   under\n\nMassachusetts law.       The district court restored the Mullanes'\n\nownership rights and ordered Chambers and Farese to pay $100,000 in\n\npunitive damages to the Mullanes, for what the district court\n\ntermed their \"wanton and reckless\" disregard of the Mullanes'\n\nrights.3\n\n            We vacated and remanded, concluding that Chambers and\n\nFarese were entitled to rely on the public record unless they had\n\nactual notice of the transfer to the Mullanes, and that they had\n\nadhered to Massachusetts law in seizing the vessel.             See Mullane,\n\n333 F.3d at 329-33.       We asked the district court to determine\n\nwhether Chambers and Farese had knowledge of the Mullanes' claim to\n\nthe vessel before they completed their seizure.              We noted that if\n\n\n\n3\n  The district court found that no relief was warranted on the\nMullanes' claims against the sheriff's department.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthe district court found that Chambers and Farese had knowledge of\n\nthe Mullanes' purchase, the court would need to determine whether\n\nthere was any merit in Chambers and Farese's claim that the\n\nMurphys'   sale   of     the   vessel    to    the    Mullanes   constituted   a\n\nfraudulent transfer under Massachusetts law.              (The district court\n\nhad   resolved    that    question      in    the    Mullanes'   favor   through\n\napplication of federal law, which we concluded did not govern the\n\ntransaction.)\n\n           On remand, the district court found that Chambers and\n\nFarese had no actual or constructive notice of the Mullanes'\n\npurchase at the time of the seizure (though they did within hours\n\nthereafter).4     Consequently, the district court determined that\n\nChambers and Farese had a valid claim on the vessel.               The parties\n\ndo not contest this determination on appeal.              Because the district\n\ncourt found that Chambers and Farese had valid liens on the vessel,\n\nit did not need to reexamine the fraudulent transfer issue.\n\n           Recognizing that application of 46 U.S.C. § 31321, the\n\nvessel documentation statute, would yield a \"harsh\" penalty on the\n\n\"innocent\" Mullanes, the district court invited briefing on whether\n\nthe Mullanes might be entitled to relief from that application, on\n\nadmiralty or analogous state law grounds.              The Mullanes suggested\n\n\n4\n  After our remand, the case was assigned to a different district\ncourt judge than the one who presided at the first trial. Due to\nthat judge's busy schedule, the case was reassigned to the Chief\nJudge, who presided at the second trial and entered the judgment\nthat we now review.\n\n                                        -6-\n\fonly that they were entitled to a maritime lien on the vessel,\n\nequal   in   value   to   the   Eastern     Bank   mortgage   that   they   had\n\ndischarged.     The district court determined that no such maritime\n\nlien existed.\n\n             Finally, the court ordered, \"in the interest of equity,\"\n\nthat Chambers and Farese \"reimburse the Mullanes for all reasonable\n\nstorage and insurance costs of the vessel incurred since the levy.\"\n\nThe Mullanes had incurred such charges by storing the vessel at\n\nvarious marinas during the course of the litigation as they tried\n\nto clear title to the vessel.\n\n                                      II.\n\nA.   The Mullanes' Appeal\n\n             At the conclusion of the second trial in this case, the\n\ndistrict court opined that relief might be possible on grounds\n\nthat, in light of Chambers and Farese's seizure, the Mullanes'\n\ndischarge of the Eastern Bank mortgage had unjustly enriched\n\nMurphy. Seeking to resolve the issue, the district court gave very\n\nspecific instructions:\n\n             I . . . need to have briefed the issue of . .\n             . the role that Dr. Mullane's discharge of the\n             preferred ships mortgage plays here. I'm not\n             here talking about simple appeals to equity. .\n             . .   I want to know everything there is to\n             know about this type of circumstance either\n             under the federal recording statute, and if we\n             can't find that let's go to the common law of\n             the several states which have recording\n             statutes.   When a creditor seeks to levy on\n             encumbered assets of the debtor, the creditor\n             takes those assets encumbered.     Here there\n\n                                -7-\n\f          appears no evidence but that Dr. Mullane was\n          innocent . . .. Dr. Mullane may be entitled\n          to . . . the equivalent of a preferred ship's\n          mortgage . . ..\n\nTr. Day 2, pp. 33-34 (emphasis added).\n\n          Whether or not an equitable subordination argument could\n\nhave been made on these facts, it was not made before the district\n\ncourt or before us, and so is waived.    Cf. Maryland National Bank\n\nv. The Vessel Madam Chapel, 46 F.3d 895, 901 (9th Cir. 1995)\n\n(recognizing   that   equitable   subordination   is   \"available    in\n\nadmiralty to resolve priority disputes\").     Instead, the Mullanes\n\nargued that they were entitled to a maritime lien on the vessel,\n\nwhich they argued had been created by their discharge of the\n\nEastern Bank mortgage.5   The holder of a maritime lien can look to\n\na vessel itself, in rem, to satisfy any resultant debt.             See\n\ngenerally 46 U.S.C. § 31301 et seq.; Fed. R. Civ. P. C(1)(a); 2-II\n\nBenedict on Admiralty (2004).     The Mullanes relied on 46 U.S.C.\n\n\n\n5\n  The Mullanes argue here, as they did in their motion for\nreconsideration before the district court, that they had asked not\nfor a maritime lien but for an equitable lien. But the Mullanes\ndid not forward any theory of law pursuant to which an equitable\nlien could be granted. While they included the term \"equitable\nlien\" in their post-trial motion, the Mullanes relied entirely on\ntwo maritime lien theories and asserted that Dr. Mullane was \"the\nholder of a maritime lien.\"      Pltfs. Post Trial Brief at 11.\nPerhaps the Mullanes mistakenly thought that their maritime lien\ntheories could create equitable liens. But see 2-III Benedict on\nAdmiralty § 24 (2005) (suggesting consensus that maritime liens\nare \"stricti jurris; they cannot be conferred on the theory of\nunjust enrichment or subrogation\"). At most, however, the Mullanes\nmade legal arguments spiked with exactly the kind of \"simple\nappeals to equity\" that the district court had asked them to avoid.\n\n                                  -8-\n\f§ 31342(a), the statute that creates a lien in favor of \"a person\n\nproviding necessaries to a vessel on the order of the owner.\"          See\n\nLake Charles Stevedores, Inc. v. Professor Vladimir Popov, MV, 199\n\nF.3d 220, 223-25 (5th Cir. 1999) (discussing generally maritime\n\nliens for necessaries).      The Mullanes also argued that they were\n\nentitled to a lien under the \"rule of advances,\" a common-law\n\nprinciple that awards liens to certain persons who do not provide\n\nnecessaries but do \"satisfy an outstanding or future lien\" on a\n\nvessel, typically by paying for necessaries that are provided by\n\nanother party.    2-III Benedict on Admiralty § 34 (2004).        See also\n\nWilkins v. Commercial Inv. Trust Corp., 153 F.3d 1273, 1276-78\n\n(11th Cir. 1998) (discussing rule of advances).\n\n           Under § 31342(a), a person provides a \"necessary\" by\n\nfurnishing \"goods or services . . . necessary to the continued\n\noperation of the vessel,\" in a manner that \"facilitates the flow of\n\ncommerce.\"     Payne v. S.S. Tropic Breeze, 423 F.2d 236, 241 (1st\n\nCir.   1970)   (discussing    predecessor    statute   to   §   31342(a)).\n\nClassically, \"necessaries\" are those things that allow a vessel to\n\nperform its ordinary functions, such as needed repairs to an engine\n\nor   foodstuffs   for   a   long   voyage.    See   Trinidad    Foundry   &\n\nFabricating, Ltd. v. M/V KAS Camilla, 966 F.2d 613, 614 n.2 (11th\n\nCir. 1992) (\"Necessaries are the items that a prudent owner would\n\nprovide to enable a ship to perform the functions for which she has\n\nbeen engaged\").    See also Bradford Marine, Inc. v. M/V Sea Falcon,\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\f64 F.3d 585, 589-90 (11th Cir. 1995) (discussing definition of\n\nnecessaries   and    concluding   that   attorney's      fees   incurred   in\n\ncollecting repair charges did not qualify as a necessary).\n\n            The rule of advances, like the doctrine of necessaries,\n\nfacilitates reimbursements of those who allow a vessel to perform\n\nits functions.       The difference is that the rule of advances\n\nprovides protection not to the person furnishing \"necessaries,\" but\n\nrather to a third person who pays for the goods and services that\n\nwould have given rise to a statutory maritime lien, on an assurance\n\nthat the vessel will be responsible for the debt.               Wilkins, 153\n\nF.3d at 1276.    See also The Emily Souder, 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 666\n\n(1873)    (holding   that   company,   which   on   request     of   American\n\nconsulate provided funds for repairs to American steamer stranded\n\nin Brazil, had maritime lien on the steamer); Universal Shipping\n\nInc. v. Panamanian Flag Barge, 563 F.2d 483 (1st Cir. 1976)\n\n(awarding maritime lien to third party that provided funds to allow\n\na vessel operator's purchase of \"supplies and other necessaries\").\n\n            On appeal, the Mullanes do not quibble with the district\n\ncourt's   conclusion   that   their    discharge    of   the    Eastern   Bank\n\nmortgage did not constitute a \"necessary\" but seek relief only\n\npursuant to the rule of advances.          We see at least two basic\n\nbarriers to the Mullanes' rule of advances theory, both also fatal\n\nto the Mullanes' § 31342(a) argument.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f           First, maritime liens, created pursuant to the rule of\n\nadvances   or   any   other   theory,   are   intended   to    safeguard   the\n\ninterests of \"strangers to the vessel,\" not vessel owners or those\n\nwho can control the vessel's affairs.            Sasportes v. M/V Sol de\n\nCopacabana, 581 F.2d 1204, 1208 (5th Cir. 1978).              \"Quite clearly,\n\nowners may not benefit by the advances rule.\"            2-III Benedict on\n\nAdmiralty § 34.       See also Medina v. Marvirazon Compania Naviera,\n\nS.A., 709 F.2d 124, 125 (1st Cir. 1983) (per curiam) (recognizing\n\nthat owners are not entitled to maritime liens).          This is because,\n\nas the district court recognized, maritime liens and the admiralty\n\njurisdiction that comes with them are a way of making the provision\n\nof services to vessels as safe and predictable as the provision of\n\nservices to land-based businesses.            A creditor with a maritime\n\nlien, not unlike the holder of a materialman's lien, can seek\n\npayment even if the person she negotiated with has absconded.              The\n\noverarching goal is keeping the channels of maritime commerce open\n\n-- by ensuring that people who service vessels have an efficient\n\nway of demanding reimbursement for their labor and are thus willing\n\nto perform the services necessary to keep vessels in operation.\n\nSee Payne, 423 F.2d at 240-41; see generally Benedict on Admiralty,\n\nsupra.     The Mullanes' discharge of Murphy's mortgage did not\n\nfurther these goals.\n\n           Second, even assuming that the Mullanes' purchase of the\n\nvessel effected a maritime lien by \"advance,\" the Mullanes already\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fhave   received    the   appropriate    compensation      for   that   advance:\n\nownership of the vessel.           The Mullanes entered into a contract\n\nwhereby they agreed to supply the funds to extinguish the Eastern\n\nBank mortgage in exchange for the vessel.                  Nothing else was\n\npromised.    The Mullanes' ownership rights were compromised not\n\nbecause the vessel's operator or owner failed to repay them for an\n\nadvance, but because, after they had been repaid in full -- and\n\nafter any maritime lien had been extinguished by satisfaction --\n\nthey   neglected    to   protect    their   rights   by   documenting    their\n\npurchase.\n\nB.   Chambers and Farese's Appeal\n\n            The district court granted the Mullanes' motion for\n\nreimbursement for the cost of storing the vessel during litigation,\n\nan expense they documented to the district court.                Chambers and\n\nFarese contend that the district court abused its discretion in so\n\ndoing.\n\n            It is well established that admiralty courts may award\n\nstorage charges on equitable grounds.           See The Ponzan, 274 U.S.\n\n117, 120-23 (1927) (recognizing authority of admiralty courts to\n\naward storage charges as flexible and equitable in nature); David\n\nForsht Assoc., Inc v. Transamerica ICS, Inc., 821 F.2d 1556, 1560-\n\n61 (11th Cir. 1987) (recognizing that storage charges in admiralty\n\nare created through equity).          See also Taino Lines, Inc. v. M/V\n\nConstance Pan Atl., 982 F.2d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1992) (recognizing\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fthat any reduction of an award of storage costs in admiralty is an\n\nequitable determination).    The district court has wide discretion\n\nin determining whether equitable relief in admiralty cases is\n\nappropriate.   Id.   We will not, on appeal, weigh the equities anew.\n\nRather, \"if there is a sound reason for the decision of the\n\n[district court], it does not matter that there are also sound\n\nreasons for the opposite result.\"       Boston & Maine Corp. v. First\n\nNat. Bank of Boston, 618 F.2d 137, 141 (1st Cir. 1980).      See also\n\nCertain Underwriters at Lloyds v. Kenco Marine Terminal, Inc., 81\n\nF.3d 871, 872-73 (9th Cir. 1996) (reviewing award of storage\n\nexpenses for abuse of discretion); Kingstate Oil v. M/V Green Star,\n\n815 F.2d 918, 922 (3d Cir. 1987) (same).\n\n          Essentially, Chambers and Farese argue that it was an\n\nabuse of discretion for the court to award storage charges because\n\nthe Mullanes, having posted a bond, could have enjoyed the use of\n\nthe vessel during the litigation.       However, there is no evidence\n\nthat the Mullanes did employ the vessel while the case was pending.\n\nThe record indicates that the vessel was damaged severely in the\n\ninitial seizure, and that its usefulness since has been limited.\n\nIn any case, we are not persuaded that the district court abused\n\nits discretion in allowing the motion for storage costs.\n\n          Storage costs were an inevitable consequence of the\n\nlitigation that we have recounted.      As we have discussed, vessels\n\nsubject to ownership disputes ordinarily are held in the custody of\n\n\n                                 -13-\n\fthe court during litigation.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. E; 28 U.S.C. §\n\n1921(a)(1)(E) (2000).   If the Mullanes had not posted security and\n\nserved as substitute custodians, the court would have been entitled\n\nto reimbursement for its storage costs.           Id.      And the court's\n\ncustodia legis expenses would have created a right superior to\n\nChambers and Farese's lien.         See 46 U.S.C. § 31326(b)(1); 2-IV\n\nBenedict on Admiralty § 51 (2005).         There is no indication on the\n\nrecord that the storage costs incurred by the Mullanes were any\n\ngreater than those that would have been incurred by the court.            The\n\nMullanes had an interest in maintaining the damaged vessel (which\n\nthey intended to use personally). Their expenditures to insure and\n\nstore the vessel during litigation benefitted all parties.            These\n\nwere good enough reasons for the district court to appoint them as\n\nthe vessel's custodians and to reimburse them for storage charges.\n\nSee David Forsht Assoc., 821 F.2d at 1561 (holding that where\n\nmultiple parties had claims to a vessel, the party that arrested\n\nthe vessel and served as substitute custodian should be entitled to\n\nreimbursement from the others, because that party benefitted all\n\nclaimants by safeguarding the vessel during litigation, at a cost\n\nlower than would have been assessed by the marshal).\n\n          Chambers   and   Farese    also    appear   to   argue   that   the\n\nMullanes should not be entitled to storage charges because they\n\ninitiated, but eventually lost, this lawsuit.               Again, we are\n\nunpersuaded.   This was not a frivolous suit.         It was a close case\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fthat required two district court trials, the first of which the\n\nMullanes won.        The district court found that the Mullanes were\n\n\"innocent\" parties, who fought at length, if unsuccessfully, to\n\nprevent their own property from being seized by another person's\n\ncreditors.     Their claim to the vessel was a plausible one.                In\n\nlight   of   these    facts,   we   discern   no   abuse   of   discretion   in\n\nreimbursing their storage charges.6           See Taino Lines, 982 F.2d at\n\n24 (no abuse of discretion in awarding custodia legis expenses\n\nwhere partially unsuccessful litigation \"was neither frivolous nor\n\nundertaken in bad faith\").\n\n                                      III.\n\n             The district court's order is affirmed in all respects.\n\nThe parties shall bear their own costs and fees.\n\n                      So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n6\n  Chambers and Farese also argue that Dr. Mullane forfeited the\nright to storage charges because, they contend, he documented the\nvessel's home port as in New Hampshire, where he intended to move\nit, rather than in Massachusetts, where it was at the time of the\nseizure, to avoid paying state sales tax on it.       We will not\nentertain this contention.     Before it allowed the Mullanes'\npetition for storage charges, the district court gave Chambers and\nFarese an opportunity to submit written objections. Chambers and\nFarese submitted a post-trial memorandum that did not include any\nreference to the sales tax issue. Accordingly, they waived the\nopportunity to make the argument they now attempt.      See In re\nWeinstein, 164 F.3d 677, 685 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n                                      -15-\n\f",

The vessel's owners, David and Joan Mullane, appeal the district court's rejection of their claim to a lien on the vessel. Adele Chambers and Jean Farese, who seized the vessel to satisfy debts of the vessel's previous owner, appeal the district court's order that they reimburse the Mullanes for storing the vessel during the course of the litigation.

This case has been tried twice, by two different district court judges, each of whom published an opinion. <i>Mullane v. Chambers,</i> 349 F.Supp.2d 190 (D.Mass.2004); <i>Mullane v. Chambers,</i> 206 F.Supp.2d 105 (D.Mass.2002). It has been the subject of a published opinion by this court. <i>Mullane v. Chambers,</i> 333 F.3d 322 (1st Cir.2003). We review only the details relevant to the issues before us. Because this case comes to us after a trial, we present the facts in the light most favorable to the district court's judgment. <i>See Wilson v. Mar. Overseas Corp.,</i> 150 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1998).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In July 1998, the Mullanes bought the vessel from a trust established by Dr. David Murphy and his wife. As consideration, the Mullanes paid $98,117 to Eastern Bank to discharge the preferred ship's mortgage on the vessel in favor of the bank,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> paid $2,000 cash to Murphy and assumed a $40,000 lien Murphy owed to his own company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The vessel was federally documented and listed on the registry maintained by the United States Coast Guard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In the normal course of maritime affairs, transfer of the vessel and discharge of the mortgage should have been recorded immediately with the Coast Guard, in which case the public record would have shown that the Mullanes, not the Murphys, owned the vessel. 46 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12101-12124, 31321. For whatever reason, however, the sale and discharge were not recorded until September. In the interim&#8212;for all of August&#8212;the public record showed erroneously that the Murphys owned the vessel, subject to a mortgage in favor of Eastern Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time he sold the vessel to the Mullanes, David Murphy was indebted to Chambers and Farese, both of whom had loaned him money. Chambers had obtained a $70,132 writ of execution against Murphy, and Farese a writ for $27,612. But neither Chambers nor Farese had attached any claim to the vessel until late August, when, acting on the information in the public record, they arranged for sheriff's deputies to seize the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chambers and Farese learned about the transfer from the Murphys to the Mullanes and the mortgage discharge hours after the seizure. Nonetheless, they elected to press their claim to the vessel rather than attempt to satisfy Murphy's debt with property that actually belonged to him. Indeed&#8212;according to their own statements&#8212;upon learning that the Eastern Bank mortgage on the vessel had been discharged, Chambers and Farese abandoned their plans to seize Murphy's condominium, which they also had arranged for the sheriff's deputies to levy. They believed that the additional equity in the vessel available after the mortgage discharge would make any seizure of Murphy's own property unnecessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Mullanes sued Farese, Chambers, and the Sheriff's Department that had seized the vessel. They claimed that the seizure had been illegal, that they were entitled to unencumbered ownership of the vessel, and that they were owed compensation for damage to the vessel that occurred during the seizure. The case landed on the admiralty docket of the district court. <i>See Mullane,</i> 333 F.3d at 328 (concluding admiralty jurisdiction correctly invoked). The Mullanes arranged for the vessel to be arrested, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. D, an action that prevented anyone from selling the vessel before litigation concluded. Initially, the vessel was held by the court. At some relatively early point, however, the Mullanes posted a $125,000 passbook savings account as security for the vessel, and it was released to their custody. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. E(5)(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the first trial in this case, the district court found that the Mullanes were bona-fide purchasers of the vessel who had no notice of Chambers and Farese's claims. The court also concluded that the seizure of the vessel was improper under Massachusetts law. The district court restored the Mullanes' ownership rights and ordered Chambers and Farese to pay $100,000 in punitive damages to the Mullanes, for what the district court termed their \"wanton and reckless\" disregard of the Mullanes' rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We vacated and remanded, concluding that Chambers and Farese were entitled to rely on the public record unless they had actual notice of the transfer to the Mullanes, and that they had adhered to Massachusetts law in seizing the vessel. <i>See Mullane,</i> 333 F.3d at 329-33. We asked the district court to determine whether Chambers and Farese had knowledge of the Mullanes' claim to the vessel before they completed their seizure. We noted that if the district court found that Chambers and Farese had knowledge of the Mullanes' purchase, the court would need to determine whether there was any merit in Chambers and Farese's claim that the Murphys' sale of the vessel to the Mullanes constituted a fraudulent transfer under Massachusetts law. (The district court had resolved that question in the Mullanes' favor through application of federal law, which we concluded did not govern the transaction.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court found that Chambers and Farese had no actual or constructive notice of the Mullanes' purchase at the time of the seizure (though they did within hours thereafter).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Consequently, the district court determined that Chambers and Farese had a valid claim on the vessel. The parties do not contest this determination on appeal. Because the district court found that Chambers and Farese had valid liens on the vessel, it did not need to reexamine the fraudulent transfer issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that application of 46 U.S.C. &#167; 31321, the vessel documentation statute, would yield a \"harsh\" penalty on the \"innocent\" Mullanes, the district court invited briefing on whether the Mullanes might be entitled to relief from that application, on admiralty or analogous state law grounds. The Mullanes suggested only that they were entitled to a maritime lien on the vessel, equal in value to the Eastern Bank mortgage that they had discharged. The district court determined that no such maritime lien existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court ordered, \"in the interest of equity,\" that Chambers and Farese \"reimburse the Mullanes for all reasonable storage and insurance costs of the vessel incurred since the levy.\" The Mullanes had incurred such charges by storing the vessel at various marinas during the course of the litigation as they tried to clear title to the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Mullanes' Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the second trial in this case, the district court opined that relief might be possible on grounds that, in light of Chambers and Farese's seizure, the Mullanes' discharge of the Eastern Bank mortgage had unjustly enriched Murphy. Seeking to resolve the issue, the district court gave very specific instructions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I . . . need to have briefed the issue of. . . the role that Dr. Mullane's discharge of the preferred ships mortgage plays here. I'm not here talking about simple appeals to equity. . . . <i>I want to know everything there is to know</i> about this type of circumstance either under the federal recording statute, and if we can't find that <i>let's go to the common law of the several states which have recording statutes.</i> When a creditor seeks to levy on encumbered assets of the debtor, the creditor takes those assets encumbered. Here there appears no evidence but that Dr. Mullane was innocent. . . . Dr. Mullane may be entitled to . . . the equivalent of a preferred ship's mortgage. . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Tr.

Maryland National Bank v. The Vessel Madam Chapel,</i> 46 F.3d 895, 901 (9th Cir.1995) (recognizing that equitable subordination is \"available in admiralty to resolve priority disputes\"). Instead, the Mullanes argued that they were entitled to a maritime lien on the vessel, which they argued had been created by their discharge of the Eastern Bank mortgage.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The holder of a maritime lien can look to a vessel itself, <i>in rem,</i> to satisfy any resultant debt. <i>See generally</i> 46 U.S.C. &#167; 31301 <i>et seq.;</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. C(1)(a); 2-II Benedict on Admiralty (2004). The Mullanes relied on 46 U.S.C. &#167; 31342(a), the statute that creates a lien in favor of \"a person providing necessaries to a vessel on the order of the owner.\" <i>See Lake Charles Stevedores, Inc. v. PROFESSOR VLADIMIR POPOV, MV,</i> 199 F.3d 220, 223-25 (5th Cir.1999) (discussing generally maritime liens for necessaries). The Mullanes also argued that they were entitled to a lien under the \"rule of advances,\" a common-law principle that awards liens to certain persons who do not provide necessaries but do \"satisfy an outstanding or future lien\" on a vessel, typically by paying for necessaries that are provided by another party. 2-III Benedict on Admiralty &#167; 34 (2004). <i>See also Wilkins v. Commercial Inv. Trust Corp.,</i> 153 F.3d 1273, 1276-78 (11th Cir.1998) (discussing rule of advances).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under &#167; 31342(a), a person provides a \"necessary\" by furnishing \"goods or services . . . necessary to the continued operation of the vessel,\" in a manner that \"facilitates the flow of commerce.\" <i>Payne v. S.S. Tropic Breeze,</i> 423 F.2d 236, 241 (1st Cir.1970) (discussing predecessor statute to &#167; 31342(a)). Classically, \"necessaries\" are those things that allow a vessel to perform its ordinary functions, such as needed repairs to an engine or foodstuffs for a long voyage. <i>See Trinidad Foundry &amp; Fabricating, Ltd. v. M/V KAS Camilla,</i> 966 F.2d 613, 614 n. 2 (11th Cir.1992) (\"Necessaries are the items that a prudent owner would provide to enable a ship to perform the functions for which she has been engaged\"). <i>See also Bradford Marine, Inc. v. M/V Sea Falcon,</i> 64 F.3d 585, 589-90 (11th Cir.1995) (discussing definition of necessaries and concluding that attorney's fees incurred in collecting repair charges did not qualify as a necessary).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The rule of advances, like the doctrine of necessaries, facilitates reimbursements of those who allow a vessel to perform its functions. The difference is that the rule of advances provides protection not to the person furnishing \"necessaries,\" but rather to a third person who pays for the goods and services that would have given rise to a statutory maritime lien, on an assurance that the vessel will be responsible for the debt. <i>Wilkins,</i> 153 F.3d at 1276. <i>See also The Emily Souder,</i> 84 U.S. (17 Wall.) 666, 21 L.Ed. 683 (1873) (holding that company, which on request of American consulate provided funds for repairs to American steamer stranded in Brazil, had maritime lien on the steamer); <i>Universal Shipping Inc. v. Panamanian Flag Barge,</i> 563 F.2d 483 (1st Cir.1976) (awarding maritime lien to third party that provided funds to allow a vessel operator's purchase of \"supplies and other necessaries\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, the Mullanes do not quibble with the district court's conclusion that their discharge of the Eastern Bank mortgage did not constitute a \"necessary\" but seek relief only pursuant to the rule of advances. We see at least two basic barriers to the Mullanes' rule of advances theory, both also fatal to the Mullanes' &#167; 31342(a) argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, maritime liens, created pursuant to the rule of advances or any other theory, are intended to safeguard the interests of \"strangers to the vessel,\" not vessel owners or those who can control the vessel's affairs. <i>Sasportes v. M/V Sol de</i> <i>Copacabana,</i> 581 F.2d 1204, 1208 (5th Cir. 1978). \"Quite clearly, owners may not benefit by the advances rule.\" 2-III Benedict on Admiralty &#167; 34. <i>See also Medina v. Marvirazon Compania Naviera, S.A.,</i> 709 F.2d 124, 125 (1st Cir.1983) (per curiam) (recognizing that owners are not entitled to maritime liens). This is because, as the district court recognized, maritime liens and the admiralty jurisdiction that comes with them are a way of making the provision of services to vessels as safe and predictable as the provision of services to land-based businesses. A creditor with a maritime lien, not unlike the holder of a materialman's lien, can seek payment even if the person she negotiated with has absconded. The overarching goal is keeping the channels of maritime commerce open&#8212;by ensuring that people who service vessels have an efficient way of demanding reimbursement for their labor and are thus willing to perform the services necessary to keep vessels in operation. <i>See Payne,</i> 423 F.2d at 240-41; <i>see generally</i> Benedict on Admiralty, <i>supra.</i> The Mullanes' discharge of Murphy's mortgage did not further these goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even assuming that the Mullanes' purchase of the vessel effected a maritime lien by \"advance,\" the Mullanes already have received the appropriate compensation for that advance: ownership of the vessel. The Mullanes entered into a contract whereby they agreed to supply the funds to extinguish the Eastern Bank mortgage in exchange for the vessel. Nothing else was promised. The Mullanes' ownership rights were compromised not because the vessel's operator or owner failed to repay them for an advance, but because, after they had been repaid in full-and after any maritime lien had been extinguished by satisfaction-they neglected to protect their rights by documenting their purchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Chambers and Farese's Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court granted the Mullanes' motion for reimbursement for the cost of storing the vessel during litigation, an expense they documented to the district court. Chambers and Farese contend that the district court abused its discretion in so doing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is well established that admiralty courts may award storage charges on equitable grounds. <i>See The Poznan,</i> 274 U.S. 117, 120-23, 47 S.Ct. 482, 71 L.Ed. 955 (1927) (recognizing authority of admiralty courts to award storage charges as flexible and equitable in nature); <i>Donald Forsht Assoc., Inc. v. Transamerica ICS, Inc.,</i> 821 F.2d 1556, 1560-61 (11th Cir. 1987) (recognizing that storage charges in admiralty are created through equity). <i>See also Taino Lines, Inc. v. M/V Constance Pan Atl.,</i> 982 F.2d 20, 24 (1st Cir. 1992) (recognizing that any reduction of an award of storage costs in admiralty is an equitable determination). The district court has wide discretion in determining whether equitable relief in admiralty cases is appropriate. <i>Id.</i> We will not, on appeal, weigh the equities anew. Rather, \"if there is a sound reason for the decision of the [district court], it does not matter that there are also sound reasons for the opposite result.\" <i>Boston &amp; Maine Corp. v. First Nat. Bank of Boston,</i> 618 F.2d 137, 141 (1st Cir.1980). <i>See also Certain Underwriters at Lloyds v.

However, there is no evidence that the Mullanes did employ the vessel while the case was pending. The record indicates that the vessel was damaged severely in the initial seizure, and that its usefulness since had been limited. In any case, we are not persuaded that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the motion for storage costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Storage costs were an inevitable consequence of the litigation that we have recounted. As we have discussed, vessels subject to ownership disputes ordinarily are held in the custody of the court during litigation. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. E; 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1921(a)(1)(E) (2000). If the Mullanes had not posted security and served as substitute custodians, the court would have been entitled to reimbursement for its storage costs. <i>Id.</i> And the court's <i>custodia legis</i> expenses would have created a right superior to Chambers and Farese's lien. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. &#167; 31326(b)(1); 2-IV Benedict on Admiralty &#167; 51 (2005). There is no indication on the record that the storage costs incurred by the Mullanes were any greater than those that would have been incurred by the court. The Mullanes had an interest in maintaining the damaged vessel (which they intended to use personally). Their expenditures to insure and store the vessel during litigation benefitted all parties. These were good enough reasons for the district court to appoint them as the vessel's custodians and to reimburse them for storage charges. <i>See Donald Forsht Assoc.,</i> 821 F.2d at 1561 (holding that where multiple parties had claims to a vessel, the party that arrested the vessel and served as substitute custodian should be entitled to reimbursement from the others, because that party benefitted all claimants by safeguarding the vessel during litigation, at a cost lower than would have been assessed by the marshal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chambers and Farese also appear to argue that the Mullanes should not be entitled to storage charges because they initiated, but eventually lost, this lawsuit. Again, we are unpersuaded. This was not a frivolous suit. It was a close case that required two district court trials, the first of which the Mullanes won. The district court found that the Mullanes were \"innocent\" parties, who fought at length, if unsuccessfully, to prevent their own property from being seized by another person's creditors. Their claim to the vessel was a plausible one. In light of these facts, we discern no abuse of discretion in reimbursing their storage charges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Taino Lines,</i> 982 F.2d at 24 (no abuse of discretion in awarding <i>custodia legis</i> expenses where partially unsuccessful litigation \"was neither frivolous nor undertaken in bad faith\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's order is <i>affirmed</i> in all respects.

We will not entertain this contention. Before it allowed the Mullanes' petition for storage charges, the district court gave Chambers and Farese an opportunity to submit written objections. Chambers and Farese submitted a post-trial memorandum that did not include any reference to the sales tax issue. Accordingly, they waived the opportunity to make the argument they now attempt<i>See In re Weinstein,</i> 164 F.3d 677, 685 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

As consideration, the Mullanes paid $98,117 to Eastern Bank to discharge the preferred ship's mortgage on the vessel in favor of the bank,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> paid $2,000 cash to Murphy and assumed a $40,000 lien Murphy owed to his own company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The vessel was federally documented and listed on the registry maintained by the United States Coast Guard.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In the normal course of maritime affairs, transfer of the vessel and discharge of the mortgage should have been recorded immediately with the Coast Guard, in which case the public record would have shown that the Mullanes, not the Murphys, owned the vessel. 46 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 12101-12124, 31321. For whatever reason, however, the sale and discharge were not recorded until September. In the interim&#8212;for all of August&#8212;the public record showed erroneously that the Murphys owned the vessel, subject to a mortgage in favor of Eastern Bank.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the time he sold the vessel to the Mullanes, David Murphy was indebted to Chambers and Farese, both of whom had loaned him money. Chambers had obtained a $70,132 writ of execution against Murphy, and Farese a writ for $27,612. But neither Chambers nor Farese had attached any claim to the vessel until late August, when, acting on the information in the public record, they arranged for sheriff's deputies to seize the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chambers and Farese learned about the transfer from the Murphys to the Mullanes and the mortgage discharge hours after the seizure. Nonetheless, they elected to press their claim to the vessel rather than attempt to satisfy Murphy's debt with property that actually belonged to him. Indeed&#8212;according to their own statements&#8212;upon learning that the Eastern Bank mortgage on the vessel had been discharged, Chambers and Farese abandoned their plans to seize Murphy's condominium, which they also had arranged for the sheriff's deputies to levy. They believed that the additional equity in the vessel available after the mortgage discharge would make any seizure of Murphy's own property unnecessary.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Mullanes sued Farese, Chambers, and the Sheriff's Department that had seized the vessel. They claimed that the seizure had been illegal, that they were entitled to unencumbered ownership of the vessel, and that they were owed compensation for damage to the vessel that occurred during the seizure. The case landed on the admiralty docket of the district court. <i>See Mullane,</i> 333 F.3d at 328 (concluding admiralty jurisdiction correctly invoked). The Mullanes arranged for the vessel to be arrested, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. D, an action that prevented anyone from selling the vessel before litigation concluded. Initially, the vessel was held by the court. At some relatively early point, however, the Mullanes posted a $125,000 passbook savings account as security for the vessel, and it was released to their custody. <i>See</i> Fed. R.Civ.P. E(5)(d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the first trial in this case, the district court found that the Mullanes were bona-fide purchasers of the vessel who had no notice of Chambers and Farese's claims. The court also concluded that the seizure of the vessel was improper under Massachusetts law. The district court restored the Mullanes' ownership rights and ordered Chambers and Farese to pay $100,000 in punitive damages to the Mullanes, for what the district court termed their \"wanton and reckless\" disregard of the Mullanes' rights.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We vacated and remanded, concluding that Chambers and Farese were entitled to rely on the public record unless they had actual notice of the transfer to the Mullanes, and that they had adhered to Massachusetts law in seizing the vessel. <i>See Mullane,</i> 333 F.3d at 329-33. We asked the district court to determine whether Chambers and Farese had knowledge of the Mullanes' claim to the vessel before they completed their seizure. We noted that if the district court found that Chambers and Farese had knowledge of the Mullanes' purchase, the court would need to determine whether there was any merit in Chambers and Farese's claim that the Murphys' sale of the vessel to the Mullanes constituted a fraudulent transfer under Massachusetts law. (The district court had resolved that question in the Mullanes' favor through application of federal law, which we concluded did not govern the transaction.)</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the district court found that Chambers and Farese had no actual or constructive notice of the Mullanes' purchase at the time of the seizure (though they did within hours thereafter).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Consequently, the district court determined that Chambers and Farese had a valid claim on the vessel. The parties do not contest this determination on appeal. Because the district court found that Chambers and Farese had valid liens on the vessel, it did not need to reexamine the fraudulent transfer issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Recognizing that application of 46 U.S.C. &#167; 31321, the vessel documentation statute, would yield a \"harsh\" penalty on the \"innocent\" Mullanes, the district court invited briefing on whether the Mullanes might be entitled to relief from that application, on admiralty or analogous state law grounds. The Mullanes suggested only that they were entitled to a maritime lien on the vessel, equal in value to the Eastern Bank mortgage that they had discharged. The district court determined that no such maritime lien existed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the court ordered, \"in the interest of equity,\" that Chambers and Farese \"reimburse the Mullanes for all reasonable storage and insurance costs of the vessel incurred since the levy.\" The Mullanes had incurred such charges by storing the vessel at various marinas during the course of the litigation as they tried to clear title to the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. The Mullanes' Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the conclusion of the second trial in this case, the district court opined that relief might be possible on grounds that, in light of Chambers and Farese's seizure, the Mullanes' discharge of the Eastern Bank mortgage had unjustly enriched Murphy. Seeking to resolve the issue, the district court gave very specific instructions:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I . . . need to have briefed the issue of. . . the role that Dr. Mullane's discharge of the preferred ships mortgage plays here.

C(1)(a); 2-II Benedict on Admiralty (2004). The Mullanes relied on 46 U.S.C. &#167; 31342(a), the statute that creates a lien in favor of \"a person providing necessaries to a vessel on the order of the owner.\" <i>See Lake Charles Stevedores, Inc. v.

The Mullanes also argued that they were entitled to a lien under the \"rule of advances,\" a common-law principle that awards liens to certain persons who do not provide necessaries but do \"satisfy an outstanding or future lien\" on a vessel, typically by paying for necessaries that are provided by another party. 2-III Benedict on Admiralty &#167; 34 (2004). <i>See also Wilkins v.

This is because, as the district court recognized, maritime liens and the admiralty jurisdiction that comes with them are a way of making the provision of services to vessels as safe and predictable as the provision of services to land-based businesses. A creditor with a maritime lien, not unlike the holder of a materialman's lien, can seek payment even if the person she negotiated with has absconded. The overarching goal is keeping the channels of maritime commerce open&#8212;by ensuring that people who service vessels have an efficient way of demanding reimbursement for their labor and are thus willing to perform the services necessary to keep vessels in operation. <i>See Payne,</i> 423 F.2d at 240-41; <i>see generally</i> Benedict on Admiralty, <i>supra.</i> The Mullanes' discharge of Murphy's mortgage did not further these goals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, even assuming that the Mullanes' purchase of the vessel effected a maritime lien by \"advance,\" the Mullanes already have received the appropriate compensation for that advance: ownership of the vessel. The Mullanes entered into a contract whereby they agreed to supply the funds to extinguish the Eastern Bank mortgage in exchange for the vessel. Nothing else was promised. The Mullanes' ownership rights were compromised not because the vessel's operator or owner failed to repay them for an advance, but because, after they had been repaid in full-and after any maritime lien had been extinguished by satisfaction-they neglected to protect their rights by documenting their purchase.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B.

However, there is no evidence that the Mullanes did employ the vessel while the case was pending. The record indicates that the vessel was damaged severely in the initial seizure, and that its usefulness since had been limited. In any case, we are not persuaded that the district court abused its discretion in allowing the motion for storage costs.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Storage costs were an inevitable consequence of the litigation that we have recounted. As we have discussed, vessels subject to ownership disputes ordinarily are held in the custody of the court during litigation. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. E; 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1921(a)(1)(E) (2000). If the Mullanes had not posted security and served as substitute custodians, the court would have been entitled to reimbursement for its storage costs. <i>Id.</i> And the court's <i>custodia legis</i> expenses would have created a right superior to Chambers and Farese's lien. <i>See</i> 46 U.S.C. &#167; 31326(b)(1); 2-IV Benedict on Admiralty &#167; 51 (2005). There is no indication on the record that the storage costs incurred by the Mullanes were any greater than those that would have been incurred by the court. The Mullanes had an interest in maintaining the damaged vessel (which they intended to use personally). Their expenditures to insure and store the vessel during litigation benefitted all parties. These were good enough reasons for the district court to appoint them as the vessel's custodians and to reimburse them for storage charges. <i>See Donald Forsht Assoc.,</i> 821 F.2d at 1561 (holding that where multiple parties had claims to a vessel, the party that arrested the vessel and served as substitute custodian should be entitled to reimbursement from the others, because that party benefitted all claimants by safeguarding the vessel during litigation, at a cost lower than would have been assessed by the marshal).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Chambers and Farese also appear to argue that the Mullanes should not be entitled to storage charges because they initiated, but eventually lost, this lawsuit. Again, we are unpersuaded. This was not a frivolous suit. It was a close case that required two district court trials, the first of which the Mullanes won. The district court found that the Mullanes were \"innocent\" parties, who fought at length, if unsuccessfully, to prevent their own property from being seized by another person's creditors. Their claim to the vessel was a plausible one. In light of these facts, we discern no abuse of discretion in reimbursing their storage charges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Taino Lines,</i> 982 F.2d at 24 (no abuse of discretion in awarding <i>custodia legis</i> expenses where partially unsuccessful litigation \"was neither frivolous nor undertaken in bad faith\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court's order is <i>affirmed</i> in all respects.

But the Mullanes did not forward any theory of law pursuant to which an equitable lien could be granted. While they included the term \"equitable lien\" in their post-trial motion, the Mullanes relied entirely on two maritime lien theories and asserted that Dr. Mullane was \"the holder of a maritime lien.\" Pltfs. Post Trial Brief at 11. Perhaps the Mullanes mistakenly thought that their maritime lien theories could create equitable liens. <i>But see</i> 2-III Benedict on Admiralty &#167; 24 (2005) (suggesting consensus that maritime liens are \"<i>stricti jurris;</i> they cannot be conferred on the theory of unjust enrichment or subrogation\"). At most, however, the Mullanes made legal arguments spiked with exactly the kind of \"simple appeals to equity\" that the district court had asked them to avoid.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Chambers and Farese also argue that Dr. Mullane forfeited the right to storage charges because, they contend, he documented the vessel's home port as in New Hampshire, where he intended to move it, rather than in Massachusetts, where it was at the time of the seizure, to avoid paying state sales tax on it. We will not entertain this contention. Before it allowed the Mullanes' petition for storage charges, the district court gave Chambers and Farese an opportunity to submit written objections. Chambers and Farese submitted a post-trial memorandum that did not include any reference to the sales tax issue. Accordingly, they waived the opportunity to make the argument they now attempt<i>See In re Weinstein,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198278\"><a href=\"/opinion/198278/patriot-portfolio-v-weinstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">164</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">677</span></a></span>, 685 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
