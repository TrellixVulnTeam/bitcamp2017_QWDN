Plaintiff Zoraida Montalvo (hereinafter\n\n“Zoraida” or the “daughter”) appeals from the judgment of the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico\n\ndismissing as time-barred her suit alleging malpractice by the\n\nproviders of medical care to her deceased mother, Juana Montalvo-\n\nColón (hereinafter “Juana” or the “mother”).     Because we conclude\n\nthat Zoraida brought the action within the time allowed by the\n\napplicable statute of limitations, we vacate the judgment and\n\nremand for further proceedings.\n\n                               BACKGROUND\n\n     From February 1999 to February 2003, the Defendants provided\n\nmedical care to Juana.    In February 2003, she was diagnosed for the\n\nfirst time with lung cancer.    She then traveled to New York, where\n\nshe was admitted to St. Vincent’s Hospital on Staten Island and was\n\nfound to have terminal, Stage IV lung cancer.     She was discharged\n\non March 5, 2003 and remained in New York with her daughter Zoraida\n\nuntil her death a month and a half later, on April 20, 2003.\n\n     On April 20, 2004,1 one year after her mother’s death, Zoraida\n\nfiled a complaint in the United States District Court for Puerto\n\nRico.       Under Puerto Rico’s general tort statute, 31 L.P.R.A. §\n\n\n\n\n        1\n      On June 22, 2004, the initial, April 20, 2004 complaint was\ndismissed without prejudice because Plaintiff lacked local counsel.\nPlaintiff re-filed the complaint on June 21, 2005. The parties\nagree that April 20, 2004 is the relevant filing date for statute\nof limitations purposes.\n\n                                 - 3 -\n\f5141,2    the   suit   claimed   entitlement   to    damages   for   medical\n\nmalpractice on two different theories.              One claim, brought by\n\nZoraida as administrator and heir of her mother’s estate, sought\n\ndamages for the pain suffered by her mother as the result of the\n\nDefendants’ malpractice. The second claim was Zoraida’s personal\n\nclaim, seeking damages for her own emotional suffering (as well as\n\nexpenses incurred) as the result of the Defendants’ malpractice\n\nwhich resulted in the wrongful death of her mother.3\n\n     The Defendants moved for summary judgment on the theory that\n\nthe suit was untimely under Puerto Rico’s one year limitation\n\nperiod.    They took the position that the claims had accrued by\n\nMarch 5, 2003, the date Juana was discharged from St. Vincent’s\n\nhospital with a diagnosis of advanced, terminal cancer, which gave\n\nnotice to both mother and daughter of any failure on the part of\n\nthe Defendants to diagnose properly.           Because the suit was not\n\nfiled until more than one year later, they argued it was untimely.\n\n     The court granted summary judgment, finding the suit untimely.\n\n\n     2\n      The Puerto Rico tort statute provides: “A person who by an\nact or omission causes damage to another through fault or\nnegligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.”    31\nL.P.R.A. § 5141.\n     3\n      Under Puerto Rico law, the tort of wrongful death gives rise\nto two separate actions: “one is the personal action of the\noriginal victim of the accident for the damages that the same\nsuffered; and the other, the action which corresponds exclusively\nand by own right to the deceased’s close relatives for the damages\nthe death of their predecessor caused them.” Viuda de Delgado v.\nBoston Ins. Co., 101 D.P.R. 598, 602 (1973), translation available\nat 1973 WL 35626.\n\n                                   - 4 -\n\fThe court reasoned that the claims accrued during February or March\n\n2003 when Zoraida and her mother heard the diagnosis of the New\n\nYork doctors at which time they knew or should have known of the\n\ninadequacy of the medical care received in Puerto Rico.      Because\n\nthe suit was not brought until April 20, 2004, which was more than\n\na year after the district court found the claim had accrued, the\n\ncourt ruled that it was barred by the statute of limitations.\n\nMontalvo v. González Amparo, Civ. No. 05-1665 (JAF) (D.P.R. Feb.\n\n20, 2008).\n\n                               DISCUSSION\n\n     “We review the district court’s decision to grant defendant’s\n\nmotion for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds de\n\nnovo, construing the record in the light most favorable to the\n\nnon-moving party.”   Douglas v. York County, 433 F.3d 143, 149 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).   “We will affirm if, based on our independent review of\n\nthe evidentiary record, there is no genuine issue of material fact\n\nand the undisputed facts indicate that the moving party is entitled\n\nto judgment as a matter of law.”         Id. (citing Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n56(c)).\n\nI.   Statute of Limitations\n\n     A federal court sitting in diversity applies the choice of law\n\nrules of the forum state.     See Day & Zimmerman, Inc. v. Challoner,\n\n423 U.S. 3, 4 (1975).   “Puerto Rico applies the law of the place of\n\nthe tort, the lex loci delicti”; accordingly, Puerto Rico law\n\n\n                                 - 5 -\n\fgoverns the action. Jiminez Puig v. Avis Rent-a-Car Sys., 574 F.2d\n\n37,   40   (1st     Cir.   1978).        When     applying    Puerto     Rico       law   to\n\nsubstantive matters, Puerto Rico courts also apply Puerto Rico’s\n\nstatute       of   limitations,     as    well     as   the   concomitant           tolling\n\nprovisions         of   those    statutes.         Valedon      Martinez       v.     Hosp.\n\nPresbiteriano de la Comunidad, Inc., 806 F.2d 1128, 1133 (1st Cir.\n\n1986).\n\n      The limitation period for actions brought under § 5141 is one\n\nyear “from the time the aggrieved person had knowledge thereof.”\n\n31 L.P.R.A. § 5298(2).           Accordingly, the claims are not barred if\n\nthey accrued on or after April 20, 2003 (one year before the\n\ninitial complaint was filed) or if the statute of limitations was\n\ntolled to that date.\n\n      The district court determined that the claims had accrued by\n\nMarch    5,    2003,    when    Juana    was    discharged      from    St.    Vincent’s\n\nHospital with a diagnosis of advanced cancer, and found no basis\n\nfor tolling the one-year statute.               We disagree, and find that each\n\nof Plaintiff’s claims was within the limitations period.\n\n      A.      Zoraida’s Personal Claim\n\n      Section 5141 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, as construed                            by\n\nthe   courts       of   Puerto    Rico,    provides      that    a     close    relative\n\n(including a child) of a victim of a tort may sue for her own\n\nmental suffering occasioned by the suffering of the direct victim\n\nof the tort, without need to show that the plaintiff incurred\n\n\n                                          - 6 -\n\feither physical injury or economic loss.    See Correa v. Hosp. San\n\nFrancisco, 69 F.3d 1184, 1197 (1st Cir. 1995)(explaining that under\n\nthis section, “mental suffering is generally just as compensable as\n\nphysical harm”   (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting Burke\n\nv. Compagnie Nationale Air France, 699 F.Supp. 1016, 1018 (D.P.R.\n\n1988))); see also Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Gonzalez Rivera, 358\n\nF.2d 480, 483 (1st Cir. 1966) (“[I]t is clear that under Puerto\n\nRican law the sons and daughters of [a person] who was injured as\n\na result of the wrongful act of the defendant, have a right of\n\naction for mental suffering, anguish and anxiety caused to them by\n\nreason of their father’s injuries.       In other words, sons and\n\ndaughters have a sufficiently close relatio[n]ship to their injured\n\nfather to come within the scope of . . . Section [5141]; and their\n\nresulting mental pain, suffering and anguish are recognized as an\n\nelement of damages.”).      Zoraida’s complaint alleges that she\n\n(Zoraida) suffered damages in the form of “serious mental anguish\n\nand moral pain as a result of the death of” her mother, as well as\n\nfuneral expenses, and therefore states her own personal claim for\n\nthe wrongful death of her mother.\n\n     Under Puerto Rico law, such a claim for wrongful death “arises\n\nat the time of death.” Arturet-Vélez v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,\n\n429 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir. 2005).       The date of accrual for the\n\ndaughter’s personal claim was therefore no earlier than April 20,\n\n2003, the day her mother died, and her complaint, filed on April\n\n\n                               - 7 -\n\f20, 2004, was within the one-year statute of limitations.\n\n     B.    Zoraida’s Inherited Claim\n\n     Puerto    Rico   law     provides    that       a    decedent’s    claim   for\n\ntortiously inflicted pain and suffering sustained by the decedent\n\nprior to death can be transmitted to her heirs.                       See Morel v.\n\nDaimler Chrysler AG, 558 F. Supp. 2d 147, 148 (D.P.R. 2007) (“The\n\nPuerto Rico Supreme Court has generally determined that a civil\n\ncause of action to redress bodily injuries or moral suffering\n\nsustained prior to death may be transmitted to one’s heirs so long\n\nas the cause of action is not ‘so personalized that it depends on\n\nthe continued natural life of the deceased.’” (quoting Viuda de\n\nDelgado, 101 D.P.R. at        602)).    In addition to her personal claim\n\nfor her own suffering, Zoraida, as administratrix and heir of her\n\nmother’s estate, brings such a claim seeking damages for her\n\nmother’s    suffering    as    a   result      of    the    Defendants’    medical\n\nmalpractice.\n\n     The    Defendants      contend      that       the    mother’s     claim   was\n\nextinguished by prescription one year after the diagnosis at the\n\nNew York hospital in February 2003 made her aware of the earlier\n\nfailure of the Defendants to diagnose her cancer.                However, under\n\nPuerto Rico law, the statute of limitations for such a claim is\n\nextended by operation of 32 L.P.R.A. § 255.\n\n     Section 255 provides: “If a person entitled to bring an action\n\ndies before the expiration of the term limited for the commencement\n\n\n                                       - 8 -\n\fthereof, and the cause of action survives, an action may be\n\ncommenced by his representatives, after the expiration of that\n\ntime, and within one year [of] his death.”                 32 L.P.R.A. § 255\n\n(alteration in original). Juana died on April 20, 2003, within the\n\none-year limitations period that applied to her malpractice claim.\n\nHer claim survived in her heirs.        Therefore under § 255, suit could\n\nbe “commenced by [her] representative” after the expiration of the\n\ndecedent’s time to bring the claim, within one year of Juana’s\n\ndeath.     Zoraida brought the suit within one year of her mother’s\n\ndeath.     The suit is therefore timely.4\n\n      The Defendants argue that Plaintiff should not be permitted to\n\nrely on § 255 because she did not cite that section in her papers\n\nin   the   district   court.     It    is   true   that,   “[o]rdinarily,   an\n\nappellant who has not proffered a particular claim or defense in\n\nthe district court ‘may not unveil it in the court of appeals.’”\n\nNat’l Ass’n of Soc. Workers v. Harwood, 69 F.3d 622, 627 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (emphasis added).        See also United States v. Slade, 980 F.2d\n\n27, 31 (1st Cir. 1992) (“[A] party is not at liberty to articulate\n\nspecific arguments for the first time on appeal simply because the\n\ngeneral issue was before the district court.”); McCoy v. Mass.\n\n\n\n      4\n      The Defendants contend § 255 applies only to estates\nconstituted under Puerto Rico law and is therefore inapplicable to\nJuana’s estate established under New York law. This misreads §\n255, which extends the statute of limitations for such inherited\nclaims without suggesting in any way that it applies only to\nestates probated in Puerto Rico.\n\n                                      - 9 -\n\fInst. of Tech., 950 F.2d 13, 22 n.7 (1st Cir. 1991) (“Courts are\n\nentitled to expect represented parties to incorporate all relevant\n\narguments in the papers that directly address a pending motion.”).\n\nWe nevertheless reject the Defendants’ argument for two reasons.\n\nFirst, whether a contention has or has not been raised in a\n\nproceeding is not always absolutely clear; it is at times a matter\n\nof degree.     In this instance, Plaintiff had put before the court\n\nthe relevant facts and had argued correctly that the date of\n\naccrual of her claim was the date of her mother’s death.                   Second,\n\nas we made clear in Harwood, the rule that forbids reliance on\n\nappeal    on   a   theory    not    fully   explained   in   the    lower    court\n\nproceeding “in the last analysis, . . .           is a matter of discretion\n\n. . . [which] admits of an occasional exception.”            Harwood, 69 F.3d\n\nat 627.   In that case, we allowed the defendants to raise a defense\n\nwhich they had completely omitted from their arguments in the\n\ndistrict court.           We noted several factors that supported our\n\ndecision to allow an exception to the customary principle, some of\n\nwhich are applicable here as well.             First, it was “not a case in\n\nwhich, by neglecting to raise the issue in a timely manner, a\n\nlitigant has deprived the court of appeals of useful factfinding.\n\n. . . [T]he omitted issue [was] purely legal in nature.”                    Id. at\n\n627.      Second,    as     here,   “the    omitted   argument     [was]    highly\n\npersuasive, a circumstance that often inclines a court to entertain\n\na pivotal argument for the first time on appeal.”                    Id. at 628\n\n\n                                      - 10 -\n\f(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).             The Defendants\n\noffer no refutation of Plaintiff’s argument based on § 255. Third,\n\n“[w]e [saw] no special prejudice or inequity to the [adversary]. .\n\n. . The absence of unfairness has a definite bearing on a decision\n\nto overlook this type of a procedural default.”            Id.   There would\n\nbe no unfairness here in giving Plaintiff the extension of time to\n\nsue provided by the law of Puerto Rico.            Finally, “the omission\n\n[was]    entirely    inadvertent   .   .   .   [and]   yielded   no   tactical\n\nadvantage.”    Id.\n\n     It is true that two of the factors we relied on in Harwood are\n\nnot present here. Those were the “constitutional magnitude” of the\n\nbelated proffer, and that it “implicate[d] matters of great public\n\nmoment,” which factor we described as “perhaps [the] most salient”\n\nfor our decision.      Id.   Nonetheless, we think Plaintiff should be\n\npermitted on this record to rely on § 255.             Considering the fact\n\nthat the issue was raised, albeit in incomplete fashion, in the\n\ndistrict court, together with the several factors enumerated above\n\nthat favor granting Plaintiff a reprieve, we have concluded that\n\nthis is an instance in which a party will be allowed on appeal to\n\nrely on an argument of law which the party did not develop in the\n\ndistrict court as fully as it should have.5\n\n\n     5\n      The Defendants also contend that Zoraida was ineligible to\nbring the inherited claim for her mother’s suffering for the\nbenefit of the mother’s heirs because at the time she brought suit\nshe had not yet been named administratrix of her mother’s estate.\nThe Defendants’ motion to dismiss in the district court was based,\n\n                                   - 11 -\n\f                                CONCLUSION\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment of the\n\ndistrict   court   dismissing    the   suit,   and   remand   for   further\n\nproceedings.6   Costs are taxed in favor of the Appellant.\n\n\n\n\nin part, on that theory, but the district court made no ruling on\nit. As the Defendants acknowledge, however, Zoraida has since been\nappointed by a New York court as administratrix of her mother’s\nestate. Even if it would have been appropriate to dismiss without\nprejudice before the qualification of an administrator, it appears\nthat deficiency has since been cured. We leave the issue to be\ndealt with in the first instance in the district court in the event\nthe Defendants make a new motion upon remand.\n     6\n      The Defendants contend Zoraida’s claim for her mother’s pain\nand suffering should be dismissed for lack of diversity because her\nmother Juana, like the defendants, was a domiciliary of Puerto\nRico. The district court did not address this contention. We leave\nit to the district court to consider in the first instance.\n\n                                  - 12 -\n\f",

Pagan with whom The Pagan Law Firm, P.C. was on brief for appellant.</p>\n<p>Hector E. Ramírez-Carbo with whom Ramonita Dieppa Gonzalez and Vivas &amp; Vivas Law Office were on brief for appellees.</p>\n<p>Before LYNCH, Chief Judge, LEVAL<sup>[*]</sup> and LIPEZ, Circuit Judges.</p>\n<p>LEVAL, Circuit Judge.</p>\n<p>Plaintiff Zoraida Montalvo (hereinafter \"Zoraida\" or the \"daughter\") appeals from the judgment of the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico dismissing as time-barred her suit alleging malpractice by the providers of medical care to her deceased mother, Juana Montalvo-Colón (hereinafter \"Juana\" or the \"mother\"). Because we conclude that Zoraida brought the action within the time allowed by the applicable statute of limitations, we vacate the judgment and remand for further proceedings.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>From February 1999 to February 2003, the Defendants provided medical care to Juana. In February 2003, she was diagnosed for the first time with lung cancer. She then traveled to New York, where she was admitted to St. Vincent's Hospital on Staten Island and was found to have terminal, Stage IV lung cancer. She was discharged on March 5, 2003 and remained in New York with her daughter Zoraida until her death a month and a half later, on April 20, 2003.</p>\n<p>On April 20, 2004,<sup>[1]</sup> one year after her mother's death, Zoraida filed a complaint in the United States District Court for Puerto Rico. Under Puerto Rico's general tort statute, 31 L.P.R.A. § 5141,<sup>[2]</sup> the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*46</span> suit claimed entitlement to damages for medical malpractice on two different theories. One claim, brought by Zoraida as administrator and heir of her mother's estate, sought damages for the pain suffered by her mother as the result of the Defendants' malpractice. The second claim was Zoraida's personal claim, seeking damages for her own emotional suffering (as well as expenses incurred) as the result of the Defendants' malpractice which resulted in the wrongful death of her mother.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The Defendants moved for summary judgment on the theory that the suit was untimely under Puerto Rico's one year limitation period. They took the position that the claims had accrued by March 5, 2003, the date Juana was discharged from St. Vincent's hospital with a diagnosis of advanced, terminal cancer, which gave notice to both mother and daughter of any failure on the part of the Defendants to diagnose properly. Because the suit was not filed until more than one year later, they argued it was untimely.</p>\n<p>The court granted summary judgment, finding the suit untimely. The court reasoned that the claims accrued during February or March 2003 when Zoraida and her mother heard the diagnosis of the New York doctors at which time they knew or should have known of the inadequacy of the medical care received in Puerto Rico. Because the suit was not brought until April 20, 2004, which was more than a year after the district court found the claim had accrued, the court ruled that it was barred by the statute of limitations. <i>Montalvo v. González-Amparo,</i> Civ. No. 05-1665(JAF) (D.P.R. Feb. 20, 2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>\"We review the district court's decision to grant defendant's motion for summary judgment on statute of limitations grounds de novo, construing the record in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\" <i>Douglas v. York County,</i> 433 F.3d 143, 149 (1st Cir.2005). \"We will affirm if, based on our independent review of the evidentiary record, there is no genuine issue of material fact and the undisputed facts indicate that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" <i>Id.</i> (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c)).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. Statute of Limitations</h2>\n<p>A federal court sitting in diversity applies the choice of law rules of the forum state. <i>See </i><i>Day &amp; Zimmermann Inc. v. Challoner,</i> 423 U.S. 3, 4, 96 S.Ct. 167, 46 L.Ed.2d 3 (1975). \"Puerto Rico applies the law of the place of the tort, the lex loci delicti\"; accordingly, Puerto Rico law governs the action. <i>Jimenez Puig v. Avis Rent a Car Sys.,</i> 574 F.2d 37, 40 (1st Cir.1978). When applying Puerto Rico law to substantive matters, Puerto Rico courts also apply Puerto Rico's statute of limitations, as well as the concomitant tolling provisions of those statutes. <i>Valedon Martinez v. Hosp. Presbiteriano de la Comunidad, Inc.,</i> 806 F.2d 1128, 1133 (1st Cir.1986).</p>\n<p>The limitation period for actions brought under § 5141 is one year \"from the time the aggrieved person had knowledge <span class=\"star-pagination\">*47</span> thereof.\" 31 L.P.R.A. § 5298(2). Accordingly, the claims are not barred if they accrued on or after April 20, 2003 (one year before the initial complaint was filed) or if the statute of limitations was tolled to that date.</p>\n<p>The district court determined that the claims had accrued by March 5, 2003, when Juana was discharged from St. Vincent's Hospital with a diagnosis of advanced cancer, and found no basis for tolling the one-year statute. We disagree, and find that each of Plaintiff's claims was within the limitations period.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Zoraida's Personal Claim</h2>\n<p>Section 5141 of the Puerto Rico Civil Code, as construed by the courts of Puerto Rico, provides that a close relative (including a child) of a victim of a tort may sue for her own mental suffering occasioned by the suffering of the direct victim of the tort, without need to show that the plaintiff incurred either physical injury or economic loss. <i>See </i><i>Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco,</i> 69 F.3d 1184, 1197 (1st Cir.1995)(explaining that under this section, \"mental suffering is generally just as compensable as physical harm\" (internal quotation marks omitted) (quoting <i>Burke v. Compagnie Nationale Air France,</i> 699 F.Supp. 1016, 1018 (D.P.R.1988))); <i>see also </i><i>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Gonzalez Rivera,</i> 358 F.2d 480, 483 (1st Cir.1966) (\"[I]t is clear that under Puerto Rican law the sons and daughters of [a person] who was injured as a result of the wrongful act of the defendant, have a right of action for mental suffering, anguish and anxiety caused to them by reason of their father's injuries. In other words, sons and daughters have a sufficiently close relatio[n]ship to their injured father to come within the scope of ... Section [5141]; and their resulting mental pain, suffering and anguish are recognized as an element of damages.\"). Zoraida's complaint alleges that she (Zoraida) suffered damages in the form of \"serious mental anguish and moral pain as a result of the death of\" her mother, as well as funeral expenses, and therefore states her own personal claim for the wrongful death of her mother.</p>\n<p>Under Puerto Rico law, such a claim for wrongful death \"arises at the time of death.\" <i>Arturet-Vélez v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.,</i> 429 F.3d 10, 14 (1st Cir.2005). The date of accrual for the daughter's personal claim was therefore no earlier than April 20, 2003, the day her mother died, and her complaint, filed on April 20, 2004, was within the one-year statute of limitations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Zoraida's Inherited Claim</h2>\n<p>Puerto Rico law provides that a decedent's claim for tortiously inflicted pain and suffering sustained by the decedent prior to death can be transmitted to her heirs. <i>See </i><i>Morel v. Daimler Chrysler AG,</i> 558 F.Supp.2d 147, 148 (D.P.R.2007) (\"The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has generally determined that a civil cause of action to redress bodily injuries or moral suffering sustained prior to death may be transmitted to one's heirs so long as the cause of action is not `so personalized that it depends on the continued natural life of the deceased.'\" (quoting <i>Viuda de Delgado,</i> 101 D.P.R. at 602)). In addition to her personal claim for her own suffering, Zoraida, as administratrix and heir of her mother's estate, brings such a claim seeking damages <i>for her mother's suffering</i> as a result of the Defendants' medical malpractice.</p>\n<p>The Defendants contend that the mother's claim was extinguished by prescription one year after the diagnosis at the New York hospital in February 2003 made her aware of the earlier failure of the Defendants to diagnose her cancer. However, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> under Puerto Rico law, the statute of limitations for such a claim is extended by operation of 32 L.P.R.A. § 255.</p>\n<p>Section 255 provides: \"If a person entitled to bring an action dies before the expiration of the term limited for the commencement thereof, and the cause of action survives, an action may be commenced by his representatives, after the expiration of that time, and within one year [of] his death.\" 32 L.P.R.A. § 255 (alteration in original). Juana died on April 20, 2003, within the one-year limitations period that applied to her malpractice claim. Her claim survived in her heirs. Therefore under § 255, suit could be \"commenced by [her] representative\" after the expiration of the decedent's time to bring the claim, within one year of Juana's death. Zoraida brought the suit within one year of her mother's death. The suit is therefore timely.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The Defendants argue that Plaintiff should not be permitted to rely on § 255 because she did not cite that section in her papers in the district court. It is true that, \"<i>[o]rdinarily,</i> an appellant who has not proffered a particular claim or defense in the district court `may not unveil it in the court of appeals.'\" <i>Nat'l Ass'n of Soc. Workers v. Harwood,</i> 69 F.3d 622, 627 (1st Cir.1995) (emphasis added). <i>See also </i><i>United States v. Slade,</i> 980 F.2d 27, 31 (1st Cir.1992) (\"[A] party is not at liberty to articulate specific arguments for the first time on appeal simply because the general issue was before the district court.\"); <i>McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.,</i> 950 F.2d 13, 22 n. 7 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Courts are entitled to expect represented parties to incorporate all relevant arguments in the papers that directly address a pending motion.\"). We nevertheless reject the Defendants' argument for two reasons. First, whether a contention has or has not been raised in a proceeding is not always absolutely clear; it is at times a matter of degree. In this instance, Plaintiff had put before the court the relevant facts and had argued correctly that the date of accrual of her claim was the date of her mother's death. Second, as we made clear in <i>Harwood,</i> the rule that forbids reliance on appeal on a theory not fully explained in the lower court proceeding \"in the last analysis, ... is a matter of discretion ... [which] admits of an occasional exception.\" <i>Harwood,</i> 69 F.3d at 627. In that case, we allowed the defendants to raise a defense which they had completely omitted from their arguments in the district court. We noted several factors that supported our decision to allow an exception to the customary principle, some of which are applicable here as well. First, it was \"not a case in which, by neglecting to raise the issue in a timely manner, a litigant has deprived the court of appeals of useful factfinding.... [T]he omitted issue [was] purely legal in nature.\" <i>Id.</i> at 627. Second, as here, \"the omitted argument [was] highly persuasive, a circumstance that often inclines a court to entertain a pivotal argument for the first time on appeal.\" <i>Id.</i> at 628 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Defendants offer no refutation of Plaintiff's argument based on § 255. Third, \"[w]e [saw] no special prejudice or inequity to the [adversary].... The absence of unfairness has a definite bearing on a decision to overlook this type of a procedural default.\" <i>Id.</i> There would be no unfairness here in giving Plaintiff the extension of time to sue provided by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> the law of Puerto Rico. Finally, \"the omission [was] entirely inadvertent ... [and] yielded no tactical advantage.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>It is true that two of the factors we relied on in <i>Harwood</i> are not present here. Those were the \"constitutional magnitude\" of the belated proffer, and that it \"implicate[d] matters of great public moment,\" which factor we described as \"perhaps [the] most salient\" for our decision. <i>Id.</i> Nonetheless, we think Plaintiff should be permitted on this record to rely on § 255. Considering the fact that the issue was raised, albeit in incomplete fashion, in the district court, together with the several factors enumerated above that favor granting Plaintiff a reprieve, we have concluded that this is an instance in which a party will be allowed on appeal to rely on an argument of law which the party did not develop in the district court as fully as it should have.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment of the district court dismissing the suit, and remand for further proceedings.<sup>[6]</sup> Costs are taxed in favor of the Appellant.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Second Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  On June 22, 2004, the initial, April 20, 2004 complaint was dismissed without prejudice because Plaintiff lacked local counsel. Plaintiff re-filed the complaint on June 21, 2005. The parties agree that April 20, 2004 is the relevant filing date for statute of limitations purposes.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Puerto Rico tort statute provides: \"A person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\" 31 L.P.R.A. § 5141.</p>\n<p>[3]  Under Puerto Rico law, the tort of wrongful death gives rise to two separate actions: \"one is the personal action of the original victim of the accident for the damages that the same suffered; and the other, the action which corresponds exclusively and by own right to the deceased's close relatives for the damages the death of their predecessor caused them.\" <i>Viuda de Delgado v. Boston Ins. Co.,</i> 101 D.P.R. 598, 602 (1973), <i>translation available at</i> 1973 WL 35626.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Defendants contend § 255 applies only to estates constituted under Puerto Rico law and is therefore inapplicable to Juana's estate established under New York law. This misreads § 255, which extends the statute of limitations for such inherited claims without suggesting in any way that it applies only to estates probated in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Defendants also contend that Zoraida was ineligible to bring the inherited claim for her mother's suffering for the benefit of the mother's heirs because at the time she brought suit she had not yet been named administratrix of her mother's estate. The Defendants' motion to dismiss in the district court was based, in part, on that theory, but the district court made no ruling on it. As the Defendants acknowledge, however, Zoraida has since been appointed by a New York court as administratrix of her mother's estate. Even if it would have been appropriate to dismiss without prejudice before the qualification of an administrator, it appears that deficiency has since been cured. We leave the issue to be dealt with in the first instance in the district court in the event the Defendants make a new motion upon remand.</p>\n<p>[6]  The Defendants contend Zoraida's claim for her mother's pain and suffering should be dismissed for lack of diversity because her mother Juana, like the defendants, was a domiciliary of Puerto Rico. The district court did not address this contention. We leave it to the district court to consider in the first instance.</p>\n\n</div>",

Daimler Chrysler AG,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2531259\"><a href=\"/opinion/2531259/morel-v-daimler-chrysler-ag/\"><span class=\"volume\">558</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">147</span></a></span>, 148 (D.P.R.2007) (\"The Puerto Rico Supreme Court has generally determined that a civil cause of action to redress bodily injuries or moral suffering sustained prior to death may be transmitted to one's heirs so long as the cause of action is not `so personalized that it depends on the continued natural life of the deceased.'\" (quoting <i>Viuda de Delgado,</i> 101 D.P.R. at 602)). In addition to her personal claim for her own suffering, Zoraida, as administratrix and heir of her mother's estate, brings such a claim seeking damages <i>for her mother's suffering</i> as a result of the Defendants' medical malpractice.</p>\n<p>The Defendants contend that the mother's claim was extinguished by prescription one year after the diagnosis at the New York hospital in February 2003 made her aware of the earlier failure of the Defendants to diagnose her cancer. However, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*48</span> under Puerto Rico law, the statute of limitations for such a claim is extended by operation of 32 L.P.R.A. § 255.</p>\n<p>Section 255 provides: \"If a person entitled to bring an action dies before the expiration of the term limited for the commencement thereof, and the cause of action survives, an action may be commenced by his representatives, after the expiration of that time, and within one year [of] his death.\" 32 L.P.R.A. § 255 (alteration in original). Juana died on April 20, 2003, within the one-year limitations period that applied to her malpractice claim. Her claim survived in her heirs. Therefore under § 255, suit could be \"commenced by [her] representative\" after the expiration of the decedent's time to bring the claim, within one year of Juana's death. Zoraida brought the suit within one year of her mother's death. The suit is therefore timely.<sup>[4]</sup></p>\n<p>The Defendants argue that Plaintiff should not be permitted to rely on § 255 because she did not cite that section in her papers in the district court. It is true that, \"<i>[o]rdinarily,</i> an appellant who has not proffered a particular claim or defense in the district court `may not unveil it in the court of appeals.'\" <i>Nat'l Ass'n of Soc. Workers v. Harwood,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"707518\"><a href=\"/opinion/707518/national-association-of-social-workers-v-john-b-harwood/\"><span class=\"volume\">69</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">622</span></a></span>, 627 (1st Cir.1995) (emphasis added). <i>See also </i><i>United States v. Slade,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"595481\"><a href=\"/opinion/595481/united-states-v-frances-slade/\"><span class=\"volume\">980</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 31 (1st Cir.1992) (\"[A] party is not at liberty to articulate specific arguments for the first time on appeal simply because the general issue was before the district court.\"); <i>McCoy v. Mass. Inst. of Tech.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"572652\"><a href=\"/opinion/572652/james-l-mccoy-administrator-of-the-electrical-workers-trust-funds-etc-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 22 n. 7 (1st Cir.1991) (\"Courts are entitled to expect represented parties to incorporate all relevant arguments in the papers that directly address a pending motion.\"). We nevertheless reject the Defendants' argument for two reasons. First, whether a contention has or has not been raised in a proceeding is not always absolutely clear; it is at times a matter of degree. In this instance, Plaintiff had put before the court the relevant facts and had argued correctly that the date of accrual of her claim was the date of her mother's death. Second, as we made clear in <i>Harwood,</i> the rule that forbids reliance on appeal on a theory not fully explained in the lower court proceeding \"in the last analysis, ... is a matter of discretion ... [which] admits of an occasional exception.\" <i>Harwood,</i> 69 F.3d at 627. In that case, we allowed the defendants to raise a defense which they had completely omitted from their arguments in the district court. We noted several factors that supported our decision to allow an exception to the customary principle, some of which are applicable here as well. First, it was \"not a case in which, by neglecting to raise the issue in a timely manner, a litigant has deprived the court of appeals of useful factfinding.... [T]he omitted issue [was] purely legal in nature.\" <i>Id.</i> at 627. Second, as here, \"the omitted argument [was] highly persuasive, a circumstance that often inclines a court to entertain a pivotal argument for the first time on appeal.\" <i>Id.</i> at 628 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted). The Defendants offer no refutation of Plaintiff's argument based on § 255. Third, \"[w]e [saw] no special prejudice or inequity to the [adversary].... The absence of unfairness has a definite bearing on a decision to overlook this type of a procedural default.\" <i>Id.</i> There would be no unfairness here in giving Plaintiff the extension of time to sue provided by <span class=\"star-pagination\">*49</span> the law of Puerto Rico. Finally, \"the omission [was] entirely inadvertent ... [and] yielded no tactical advantage.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>It is true that two of the factors we relied on in <i>Harwood</i> are not present here. Those were the \"constitutional magnitude\" of the belated proffer, and that it \"implicate[d] matters of great public moment,\" which factor we described as \"perhaps [the] most salient\" for our decision. <i>Id.</i> Nonetheless, we think Plaintiff should be permitted on this record to rely on § 255. Considering the fact that the issue was raised, albeit in incomplete fashion, in the district court, together with the several factors enumerated above that favor granting Plaintiff a reprieve, we have concluded that this is an instance in which a party will be allowed on appeal to rely on an argument of law which the party did not develop in the district court as fully as it should have.<sup>[5]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we vacate the judgment of the district court dismissing the suit, and remand for further proceedings.<sup>[6]</sup> Costs are taxed in favor of the Appellant.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Second Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  On June 22, 2004, the initial, April 20, 2004 complaint was dismissed without prejudice because Plaintiff lacked local counsel. Plaintiff re-filed the complaint on June 21, 2005. The parties agree that April 20, 2004 is the relevant filing date for statute of limitations purposes.</p>\n<p>[2]  The Puerto Rico tort statute provides: \"A person who by an act or omission causes damage to another through fault or negligence shall be obliged to repair the damage so done.\" 31 L.P.R.A. § 5141.</p>\n<p>[3]  Under Puerto Rico law, the tort of wrongful death gives rise to two separate actions: \"one is the personal action of the original victim of the accident for the damages that the same suffered; and the other, the action which corresponds exclusively and by own right to the deceased's close relatives for the damages the death of their predecessor caused them.\" <i>Viuda de Delgado v. Boston Ins. Co.,</i> 101 D.P.R. 598, 602 (1973), <i>translation available at</i> 1973 WL 35626.</p>\n<p>[4]  The Defendants contend § 255 applies only to estates constituted under Puerto Rico law and is therefore inapplicable to Juana's estate established under New York law. This misreads § 255, which extends the statute of limitations for such inherited claims without suggesting in any way that it applies only to estates probated in Puerto Rico.</p>\n<p>[5]  The Defendants also contend that Zoraida was ineligible to bring the inherited claim for her mother's suffering for the benefit of the mother's heirs because at the time she brought suit she had not yet been named administratrix of her mother's estate. The Defendants' motion to dismiss in the district court was based, in part, on that theory, but the district court made no ruling on it. As the Defendants acknowledge, however, Zoraida has since been appointed by a New York court as administratrix of her mother's estate. Even if it would have been appropriate to dismiss without prejudice before the qualification of an administrator, it appears that deficiency has since been cured. We leave the issue to be dealt with in the first instance in the district court in the event the Defendants make a new motion upon remand.</p>\n<p>[6]  The Defendants contend Zoraida's claim for her mother's pain and suffering should be dismissed for lack of diversity because her mother Juana, like the defendants, was a domiciliary of Puerto Rico. The district court did not address this contention. We leave it to the district court to consider in the first instance.</p>\n\n</div>",
