Frieda       Evelyne   applied     for   asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the federal regulations\n\nimplementing     the   Convention      Against     Torture       (\"CAT\").     An\n\nimmigration judge (\"IJ\") denied all of Evelyne's claims and ordered\n\nher removed.     She appealed to the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(\"BIA\"), which affirmed.       Evelyne now petitions for review of the\n\nBIA's denial of her appeal.       After careful consideration, we deny\n\nthe petition.\n\n                         I.    FACTUAL BACKGROUND\n\n          Evelyne, a Christian Protestant from Indonesia, entered\n\nthe United States on June 15, 2001 on a nonimmigrant visa and\n\nremained past the authorized date.           On November 2, 2001, she filed\n\nan application to extend or change her nonimmigrant status, which\n\nis apparently still pending.           Subsequently, the Immigration and\n\nNaturalization    Service      (\"INS\")    commenced     removal     proceedings\n\nagainst her.     In response to the INS notice to appear, Evelyne\n\nadmitted that she had remained in the United States beyond the time\n\nallowed by her visa in violation of 8 U.S.C. § 1227(a)(1)(B).\n\nA.R. 654-55.     She petitioned the IJ for asylum, withholding of\n\nremoval, and CAT relief.\n\n          A    hearing   was    held   before    the   IJ   at   which   Evelyne\n\ntestified that she had suffered mistreatment in Indonesia on\n\naccount of her Christian faith.          She described an incident in 1998\n\nin which purported Muslim radicals had punched her in the chest.\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fIn 1999, Muslims from a nearby mosque threw rocks at her house and\n\ntold her that the Christian prayer services she was holding were\n\ndisturbing them in the mosque; this and a later similar incident\n\nprompted her to discontinue such services.   Evelyne also described\n\na 2001 incident in which her house was ransacked, items were\n\nstolen, and anti-Christian graffiti was painted on the walls while\n\nshe was away.   She testified that her children continued to live in\n\nIndonesia after she came to the United States.   At a certain point\n\nin the hearing the IJ took over the questioning of Evelyne, and\n\nmuch of her testimony was given in response to the IJ's questions.\n\n          The IJ found that the Government had satisfied its burden\n\nof proving by clear and convincing evidence that Evelyne was\n\nremovable: she had conceded removability, and the mere fact that\n\nher visa extension application was still pending did not amount to\n\nan automatic extension.   The IJ found further that Evelyne did not\n\nqualify for asylum, withholding of removal, or CAT relief:    while\n\nshe had been a victim of religious discrimination, she had not\n\nshown that she had suffered past persecution, or that she had an\n\nobjectively reasonable basis for her fear of future persecution.\n\nThe BIA affirmed, and held additionally that the IJ had not\n\ndeprived Evelyne of a full and fair opportunity to present her case\n\nby conducting much of the examination himself.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f            Evelyne   appeals        the   BIA's   findings    that   she     was\n\nremovable, that she was not eligible for asylum,1 and that the IJ\n\ndid not deprive her of a full and fair opportunity to present her\n\ncase.    We address these items in turn.\n\n                               II.    DISCUSSION\n\n            A.   Standard of Review\n\n            We normally review decisions of the BIA and not those of\n\nimmigration judges; however, where, as here, the BIA has adopted\n\nand affirmed findings of the IJ, we also review the adopted portion\n\nof the IJ's decision.     Simo v. Gonzáles, 445 F.3d 7, 11 (1st Cir.\n\n2006); Vásquez v. INS, 177 F.3d 62, 64 (1st Cir. 1999).               We review\n\nthe BIA's legal conclusions de novo, with appropriate deference to\n\nthe agency's interpretation of the underlying statute in accordance\n\nwith    administrative   law    principles.        Molina     De   Massenet    v.\n\nGonzáles, 485 F.3d 661, 663 (1st Cir. 2007).          In asylum claims, the\n\nCourt reviews the factual findings of the BIA and the IJ under the\n\n\"substantial evidence\" standard, reversing only if the evidence of\n\nrecord would compel a reasonable factfinder to make a contrary\n\n\n\n\n1\n   Evelyne asks us to review her asylum claim, but apparently does\nnot contest the denial of her claims for withholding of removal and\nCAT relief. In any event, she clearly failed to raise these two\nclaims in her brief before the BIA, and thereby waived her right to\nhave this court consider them. Makhoul v. Ashcroft, 387 F.3d 75, 80\n(1st Cir. 2004) (\"[T]heories not advanced before the BIA may not be\nsurfaced for the first time in a petition for judicial review of\nthe BIA's final order.\").\n\n                                       -4-\n\fdetermination.     Stroni v. Gonzáles, 454 F.3d 82, 87 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).\n\n          B.   Did the BIA Err in Finding Removability?\n\n          Evelyne argues that the BIA erred in holding that the\n\nGovernment proved by clear and convincing evidence that she was\n\nremovable, as required by 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A).       We disagree.\n\nRelying on Evelyne's admission to having entered the United States\n\non a nonimmigrant tourist visa and staying beyond the allowed date\n\nof December 13, 2001, the BIA found that the Government had\n\ndischarged   its   burden   of   proving   removability   by   clear   and\n\nconvincing evidence.   It further found that Evelyne failed to meet\n\nher burden of producing evidence not known to the Government of her\n\nauthorization to remain.     We see no error in this determination.\n\nOnce Evelyne admitted her removability, the IJ and the BIA were\n\nfree to conclude that the Government had established removability.\n\nSee 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c). Moreover, as the IJ correctly held, the\n\nmere fact that Evelyne filed an application to extend her visa did\n\nnot have the effect of automatically extending it until it was\n\ndisposed of.   See Samimi v. INS, 714 F.2d 992, 994 (9th Cir. 1983)\n\n(\"[A]n immigrant is deportable as an overstay when his period of\n\nadmission expires unless he receives an extension.\" (emphasis\n\nadded) (original emphasis removed)); Matter of Teberen, 15 I. & N.\n\nDec. 689, 691 (BIA 1976).        If the rule were otherwise, any alien\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fcould extend her stay for months or even years simply by filing an\n\nextension application.\n\n            C.    Did the BIA Err               in    Finding   that    Evelyne   Was\n            Ineligible for Asylum?\n\n            Evelyne also argues that the BIA incorrectly determined\n\nthat she had suffered mere discrimination -- and not persecution --\n\nin Indonesia, that she did not have a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution, and that she was consequently ineligible for asylum.\n\nAs a prerequisite to asylum eligibility, \"an alien bears the burden\n\nof establishing that [she] is a refugee.\"                    Aguilar-Solís v. INS,\n\n168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir. 1999).                   A refugee is someone who is\n\nunwilling or unable to return to her country of nationality because\n\nshe has been persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution\n\non   the   basis    of   one   of   the    grounds      in   the   Immigration     and\n\nNationality Act; religion is one such ground.                          See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(42)(A).          To establish a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution,       the   applicant    must      demonstrate        \"both   a   genuine\n\nsubjective fear and an objectively reasonable fear of persecution\n\non a protected ground.\"         Civil v. INS, 140 F.3d 52, 55 (1st Cir.\n\n1988).     However, if the applicant makes a satisfactory showing of\n\npast persecution, \"a rebuttable presumption arises that her fear of\n\nfuture persecution is well founded.\"                  Nikijuluw v. Gonzáles, 427\n\nF.3d 115, 120 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n            There is no single definition of \"persecution.\"                    As this\n\nCourt has stated:        \"We know . . . that persecution encompasses more\n\n                                          -6-\n\fthan   threats      to    life   or     freedom,      .    .    .    but    less    than   mere\n\nharassment or annoyance . . . .                      Between these broad margins,\n\ncourts have tended to consider the subject on an ad hoc basis.\"\n\nAguilar-Solís,           168     F.3d     at        569-70      (citations           omitted).\n\nFurthermore, \"an applicant qualifies for asylum only when he\n\nsuffers persecution that is the direct result of government action,\n\ngovernment-supported           action,        or    government's           unwillingness     or\n\ninability to control private conduct.\" Nikijuluw, 427 F.3d at 121.\n\n           We find nothing in the record that would compel us to\n\ndisagree with the BIA's determination that Evelyne did not suffer\n\npast persecution, and that she lacks a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.        While Evelyne has been the target of some anti-\n\nChristian acts -- most notably the ransacking and defacing of her\n\nhouse2 -- none of these incidents is serious enough to \"rise above\n\nunpleasantness, harassment, . . . [or] basic suffering.\" Nelson v.\n\nINS, 232 F.3d 258, 263 (1st Cir. 2000).                             Moreover, all of the\n\nincidents in question appear to have been sporadic, see Palma-\n\nMazariegos     v.    Gonzáles,          428    F.3d       30,       37   (1st      Cir.    2005)\n\n(persecution requires more than sporadic abuse), and perpetrated by\n\nprivate individuals, not persons acting on behalf or with the\n\nsupport of the Indonesian government.                      Furthermore, although the\n\n\n\n2\n   Contrary to Evelyne's assertion, the IJ did specifically take\nthis incident into account in determining that Evelyne had not\nsuffered past discrimination, although he did not discuss it in\ndetail. I.J. Dec. at 4.\n\n                                              -7-\n\fIndonesian government's human rights record is admittedly far from\n\nimmaculate, the evidence of record is simply insufficient to compel\n\na finding that it is unwilling or unable to control violence\n\nagainst the Christian minority.           Finally, the fact that Evelyne's\n\nchildren continue to reside in Indonesia cuts strongly against her\n\nclaim   of    a     well-founded   fear    of   future     persecution.         Cf.\n\nAguilar-Solís, 168 F.3d at 573 (\"[T]he fact that close relatives\n\ncontinue to live peacefully in the alien's homeland undercuts the\n\nalien's claim that persecution awaits his return.\").\n\n             D. Did the BIA Err in Finding That Evelyne Was Not\n             Deprived of Due Process?\n\n             Lastly, Evelyne argues that the way in which the IJ\n\nconducted     her    immigration   hearing      violated    her    right   to    \"a\n\nreasonable opportunity to present evidence [on her] own behalf.\"\n\nBaires v. INS, 856 F.2d 89, 91 (9th Cir. 1988).3              From our review\n\nof the record, it appears that the IJ took over the questioning of\n\nEvelyne to clarify her meandering direct testimony.                The BIA found\n\nthat, despite this conduct, Evelyne had been provided with a full\n\nand fair opportunity to present her case.                We agree.     Although\n\naliens facing removal enjoy the right to a fair opportunity to be\n\nheard, Ishak v. Gonzáles, 422 F.3d 22, 32 (1st Cir. 2005), the IJ\n\nretains      broad    discretion   over     the   conduct     of    immigration\n\nproceedings, and may interrogate and cross-examine the alien and\n\n\n3\n   We review de novo whether an IJ's conduct has violated due\nprocess. Aguilar-Solís, 168 F.3d at 568.\n\n                                      -8-\n\fany witnesses.   See id. at 31; 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(b)(1).   While the\n\nIJ here evinced some impatience at the disjointed pace of Evelyne's\n\ndirect examination, he remained squarely within the bounds of\n\nproper behavior in asking the questions he did.     Cf. Ishak, 422\n\nF.3d at 31; Aguilar-Solís, 168 F.3d at 568.      It should also be\n\nnoted that he gave Evelyne's counsel the opportunity to raise\n\nfurther issues before closing the hearing, and counsel availed\n\nhimself of this opportunity.    As we have stated in the past, \"[a]\n\njudge who plays an active, but even-handed, role in keeping the\n\nfocus of the inquiry sharp is to be commended, not condemned.\"   Id.\n\nat 569.\n\n                         III.   CONCLUSION\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f",

Did the BIA Err in Finding Removability?\n\n          Evelyne argues that the BIA erred in holding that the\n\nGovernment proved by clear and convincing evidence that she was\n\nremovable, as required by 8 U.S.C. § 1229a(c)(3)(A).       We disagree.\n\nRelying on Evelyne's admission to having entered the United States\n\non a nonimmigrant tourist visa and staying beyond the allowed date\n\nof December 13, 2001, the BIA found that the Government had\n\ndischarged   its   burden   of   proving   removability   by   clear   and\n\nconvincing evidence.   It further found that Evelyne failed to meet\n\nher burden of producing evidence not known to the Government of her\n\nauthorization to remain.     We see no error in this determination.\n\nOnce Evelyne admitted her removability, the IJ and the BIA were\n\nfree to conclude that the Government had established removability.\n\nSee 8 C.F.R. § 1240.10(c). Moreover, as the IJ correctly held, the\n\nmere fact that Evelyne filed an application to extend her visa did\n\nnot have the effect of automatically extending it until it was\n\ndisposed of.

A refugee is someone who is\n\nunwilling or unable to return to her country of nationality because\n\nshe has been persecuted or has a well-founded fear of persecution\n\non   the   basis    of   one   of   the    grounds      in   the   Immigration     and\n\nNationality Act; religion is one such ground.                          See 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1101(a)(42)(A).          To establish a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution,       the   applicant    must      demonstrate        \"both   a   genuine\n\nsubjective fear and an objectively reasonable fear of persecution\n\non a protected ground.\"         Civil v.

While Evelyne has been the target of some anti-\n\nChristian acts -- most notably the ransacking and defacing of her\n\nhouse2 -- none of these incidents is serious enough to \"rise above\n\nunpleasantness, harassment, . . .

Furthermore, although the\n\n\n\n2\n   Contrary to Evelyne's assertion, the IJ did specifically take\nthis incident into account in determining that Evelyne had not\nsuffered past discrimination, although he did not discuss it in\ndetail.

Finally, the fact that Evelyne's\n\nchildren continue to reside in Indonesia cuts strongly against her\n\nclaim   of    a     well-founded   fear    of   future     persecution.         Cf.\n\nAguilar-Solís, 168 F.3d at 573 (\"[T]he fact that close relatives\n\ncontinue to live peacefully in the alien's homeland undercuts the\n\nalien's claim that persecution awaits his return.\").\n\n             D. Did the BIA Err in Finding That Evelyne Was Not\n             Deprived of Due Process?\n\n             Lastly, Evelyne argues that the way in which the IJ\n\nconducted     her    immigration   hearing      violated    her    right   to    \"a\n\nreasonable opportunity to present evidence [on her] own behalf.\"\n\nBaires v.

The BIA found\n\nthat, despite this conduct, Evelyne had been provided with a full\n\nand fair opportunity to present her case.                We agree.

It should also be\n\nnoted that he gave Evelyne's counsel the opportunity to raise\n\nfurther issues before closing the hearing, and counsel availed\n\nhimself of this opportunity.
