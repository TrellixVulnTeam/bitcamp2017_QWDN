The State of Maine\n                                        \n\nhas  enacted  a  law (hereinafter  \"the  Act\")  prohibiting a\n\nperson  from soliciting property from the general public that\n\ntangibly  benefits any  law  enforcement officer,  agency  or\n\nassociation.1     Violations  of  the  Act  are  declared  to\n\ncontravene the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act, and they may\n\nbe enjoined and penalized civilly.   Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\n\n5,   209 (West 1992).\n\n          Plaintiffs comprise a  coalition of police  unions,\n\nindividual   law   enforcement   officers,   a   professional\n\nfundraiser and a  private citizen.2  They sued  in the United\n\nStates District  Court for the District of  Maine pursuant to\n\n                    \n\n1.  Entitled  the \"Solicitation  by Law  Enforcement Officers\nAct,\" the statute provides that:\n     A  person may not solicit property from the general\n     public  when the  property  or  any  part  of  that\n     property in any way tangibly benefits, is  intended\n     to tangibly benefit or is represented to be for the\n     tangible  benefit of  any law  enforcement officer,\n     law   enforcement   agency   or   law   enforcement\n     association.\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 25,   3702-A (1992).\n\n2.  Plaintiffs include the Auburn Police Union, the  Portland\nPolice Benevolent Association, and  the Lewiston Police Union\n     all  of  which  come within  the  definition  of a  \"law\nenforcement  association\" as defined  in Me. Rev.  Stat. Ann.\ntit.  25,    3701(2); Leonard  Dexter,  Kevin MacDonald,  and\nDavid  B. Chamberlain     all  of  whom are  officers of  law\nenforcement  associations;   R.H.  McKnight   Co.,  Inc.,   a\ncorporation  in the business of fundraising and promotions on\nbehalf   of   law   enforcement   officers,   agencies,   and\nassociations through sale  of advertising and  publication of\ntrade   magazines,  programs   and  handbooks;   and  Charles\nUnderwood,  a  private  citizen who  wishes  to  advertise in\npolice  publications   and   to  receive   copies  of   those\npublications.\n\n                             -3-\n\n42 U.S.C.    1983, seeking to enjoin  the Act and to  have it\n\ndeclared unconstitutional  under  the  First  and  Fourteenth\n\nAmendments to the United States Constitution.  \n\n          While declaring  that the provision  for injunctive\n\nenforcement was  an  unconstitutional  prior  restraint,  the\n\ndistrict court otherwise upheld  the Act against  plaintiffs'\n\noverbreadth  and equal protection challenges.  Both the State\n\nof  Maine and  plaintiffs  appeal.   We  vacate the  district\n\ncourt's determination  that the  injunctive relief  provision\n\namounts to an  impermissible prior restraint, and  affirm the\n\ndistrict court's  upholding of the  constitutionality of  the\n\nAct.\n\n                              I.\n\n          As the Act was originally enacted in 1977, its sole\n\nexception was  for  solicitations  by or  on  behalf  of  law\n\nenforcement  officers  campaigning  for  election  to  public\n\noffice     an exception still in  existence.   Me. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn. tit. 25,   3703.  In 1983, the Act was  amended to allow\n\ngame wardens to sell historical publications describing state\n\nparks.3  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 25,   3702.\n\n                    \n\n3.  After  the  1983  amendment,  section  3702 provided  the\nfollowing:\n          No  person  may   solicit  property  from  the\n     general  public when the  property, or any  part of\n     it, in any way benefits, is intended to  benefit or\n     is represented  to be  for the benefit  of any  law\n     enforcement officer, law enforcement  agency or law\n     enforcement  association,  except  that  any  state\n     warden service  association may offer for  sale, by\n\n                             -4-\n\n          In 1983, Maine's Attorney General brought an action\n\nunder the  Unfair Trade  Practices Act,  Me. Rev.  Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 5,     205-A  to 214, against  the Maine  State Troopers\n\nAssociation (\"M.S.T.A.\")    a law enforcement association  as\n\ndefined  in Me.  Rev. Stat.  Ann. tit.  25,    3701(2)     to\n\nenjoin  the   M.S.T.A.  from  engaging  in  solicitations  in\n\nviolation of    3702.  The Attorney General  alleged that the\n\nM.S.T.A. had sold and offered to sell advertisements to Maine\n\nbusinesses  for insertion in  its magazine, \"The  Maine State\n\nTrooper.\"        The    M.S.T.A.   challenged    the    Act's\n\n                    \n\n     persons  other  than  wardens  or  members  of  the\n     association, to  members of the  public guide books\n     or  handbooks  containing   historical  reviews  or\n     descriptions  of  services,  except  that  on   the\n     request of a nonmember the  association may provide\n     that person with  the copies requested for  sale by\n     that  person.   No advertisements  may  be sold  or\n     included in these publications, except greetings or\n     complimentary  statements  from members  or  former\n     members  which  shall  give the  full  name  of the\n     member  or former member.   A stated  rate for this\n     advertisement space shall be published and no funds\n     in excess  of that stated  rate may be  accepted by\n     the association for space.\n          A record of  receipts and sales for  space and\n     sales  of   the  publication  shall   be  kept  and\n     available  to  the  public  during  normal  working\n     hours.\n          All  proceeds   from  these  sales   shall  be\n     expended for direct  charitable services to members\n     or  their  spouses, widows,  children,  widowers or\n     parents  and may  not  be  used  for  buildings  or\n     equipment,   construction    or   maintenance    or\n     entertainment of members.\n          Any violation of this chapter shall constitute\n     a  violation of  Title 5,  chapter  10, the  unfair\n     trade practices laws.\nMe. Rev. Stat. tit. 25,   3702.\n\n                             -5-\n\nconstitutionality, and  the case  went to  the Maine  Supreme\n\nJudicial Court  (the \"Law Court\"),  which in 1985  upheld the\n\nAct  as constitutional.   See State  v. Maine  State Troopers\n                                                             \n\nAss'n (\"MSTA\"),  491 A.2d  538 (Me.),  appeal dismissed,  474\n                                                       \n\nU.S. 802 (1985).\n\n          The Law  Court found  that Maine  had a  compelling\n\ninterest  in avoiding police  coercion.  It  found irrelevant\n\nthe subjective intent of the solicitor and the absence of any\n\ncomplaint of  coercion:   \". . . at least  the appearance  of\n\ncoercion  inheres  in  every solicitation  on  behalf  of law\n\nenforcement,\" undermining \"the integrity of the office.\"  Id.\n                                                             \n\nat  542-43.   The  Law  Court noted  the  Maine Legislature's\n\nfinding that \"[s]olicitation  by a law enforcement  agency is\n\ninherently coercive.\"  Id.   In the court's view, the State's\n                          \n\ninterest \"in protecting the reputation of its law enforcement\n\nbodies is undeniably substantial.   Indeed, we would be  hard\n\npressed to suggest  a weightier interest.\"  Id.   Holding the\n                                               \n\nstatute   not  to  be  \"fatally  overbroad,\"  the  Law  Court\n\nemphasized that \"the integrity of the State's law enforcement\n\nagents  is cast  in doubt  with every  solicitation on  their\n\nbehalf.\"  Id.  Thus the court found the Act constitutional.  \n             \n\n          The Law Court, however,  affirmed the lower court's\n\ndecision  that under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the\n\nFourteenth  Amendment, the State could not impose any greater\n\nrestrictions  on the  solicitation  activities of  other  law\n\n                             -6-\n\nenforcement officers  than were  imposed upon  state wardens.\n\nId. at 544.4   The Maine State  Troopers Association appealed\n   \n\nfrom the  Law Court's  decision to the  Supreme Court  of the\n\nUnited  States, which summarily dismissed the appeal for want\n\nof a substantial federal question. Maine State Troopers Ass'n\n                                                             \n\nv. Maine, 474 U.S. 802 (1985).\n        \n\n          In  1989,  following  the Supreme  Court's  summary\n\ndismissal  of the  appeal  in  MSTA,  the  Maine  Legislature\n                                   \n\namended  the  Act so  as  to  permit  the Department  of  the\n\nAttorney General to charge for the cost of consumer education\n\nmaterials.  Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 25,    3706.  The Legislature\n\nadditionally  amended the Act  to permit solicitations  for a\n\nperiod of one year, later  extended an additional six months,\n\nto raise  funds for the  construction of a memorial  to slain\n\npolice  officers.  Priv. &amp;  Spec. Laws 1989,  Ch. 47; Priv. &amp;\n\nSpec. Laws 1990, Ch. 114.\n\n          In  1990,  the  same  plaintiffs  who  brought  the\n\npresent suit challenged  the constitutionality of the  Act in\n\nthe federal  district  court.   See  Auburn Police  Union  v.\n                                                         \n\nTierney (\"Auburn I\"),  756 F. Supp.  610 (D. Me. 1991).   The\n                  \n\ndistrict court affirmed the magistrate judge, who ruled in  a\n\ncomprehensive  opinion  that   the  Supreme  Court's  summary\n\n                    \n\n4.  The  Law Court affirmed  the lower court's  judgment that\nthe M.S.T.A. should  be permitted to sell  their publications\nto  the  general  public, subject  to  the  same restrictions\nimposed on  associations of state  wardens by Me.  Rev. Stat.\nAnn. tit. 25,   3702.\n\n                             -7-\n\ndismissal of  MSTA was  not a binding  precedent because  the\n                  \n\nLegislature's   enactment  of   the   above  exceptions   had\n\nundermined  MSTA's  premise  that  all  solicitation  by  law\n                \n\nenforcement   officers   and  organizations   is   inherently\n\ncoercive.   Id.  at 616.5   The court  held that the  Act was\n               \n\nunconstitutionally overbroad  and invalid on its face because\n\n\"[a]  complete  prohibition  on police  solicitation  is  not\n\nnarrowly  tailored to  Maine's  evident  interest in  banning\n\nsome,  but not  all, such solicitation.\"   Id.  at 618.   The\n                                              \n\ncourt  further  concluded  that the  Act  violated  the Equal\n\nProtection  Clause of  the  Fourteenth Amendment  because the\n\nState  could  not  demonstrate   a  substantial  governmental\n\ninterest  in permitting police solicitation for a memorial to\n\nslain  officers, while  prohibiting  police solicitation  for\n\nother  causes.   Id. at  619.   Finally,  the district  court\n                    \n\ndetermined that the  Act constituted  an impermissible  prior\n\nrestraint because  it \"silences by fiat an entire category of\n\ncharitable solicitation.\"   Id. at  618.  The State  of Maine\n                               \n\ndid not appeal in that case.\n\n          Instead, in  1991, the  Maine Legislature  repealed\n\nthe exemptions, except for the exemption for solicitations by\n\n                    \n\n5.  The magistrate judge rejected arguments that MSTA and the\n                                                     \ncase before  him turned  on \"very  different\" facts  and that\npost-MSTA developments undermined MSTA's precedential value.\n                                      \n\n                             -8-\n\nor on behalf  of law enforcement officers running  for public\n\noffice.6  The  Legislature then reenacted the  prohibition on\n\nsolicitations with  one  material change     the  Legislature\n\nadded the word \"tangibly\" prior to the word \"benefits\" in the\n\nnew      3702-A  so  as   to  \"clarif[y]  that  the   ban  on\n\nsolicitations applies only when  the solicitations provide  a\n\ntangible benefit to law enforcement.\"   Sen. Amend. B to L.D.\n\n1682 (115th Legis. 1991).\n\n          In  October  1991, the  Department of  the Attorney\n\nGeneral  proposed rules under the Unfair Trade Practices Act,\n\nMe.  Rev.  Stat.  Ann.  tit.  5,    207,  defining  the  word\n\n\"tangibly\"  as used in    3702-A.7   Me. Dep't of  Att'y Gen.\n\n26-239  (1991).   These rules  provide  that \"a  solicitation\n\nwhich is  completely unrelated  to law  enforcement officers,\n\nalthough  it increases good will toward law enforcement, does\n\nnot  confer  a tangible  benefit,\" whereas  \"[a] solicitation\n\n                    \n\n6.  In  addition to  repealing  the  exception  allowing  the\nDepartment of the Attorney General  to charge for the cost of\nconsumer education materials, Me. Rev. Stat.  Ann. tit. 25,  \n3706, the Legislature repealed the exception permitting State\nWarden  Service  associations  to sell  guide  books  but not\nadvertisements, Me. Rev.  Stat. Ann. tit. 25,    3702, and an\nexception  permitting non-law  enforcement  officers to  sell\nadvertising  in publications  of  the  Department  of  Inland\nFisheries and Wildlife, Me. Rev.  Stat. Ann. tit. 25,   3705.\nThe  Private and  Special  Laws  permitting solicitations  to\nraise  funds for  the  construction of  a  memorial to  slain\npolice officers  expired by their  own terms.  Priv.  &amp; Spec.\nLaws 1989, Ch. 47; Priv. &amp; Spec. Laws 1990, Ch. 114.\n\n7.  The Attorney General has  rulemaking authority under  the\nUnfair Trade Practices  Act.  Me. Rev.  Stat.

The   \"Rules  Concerning   Unfair  Trade   Practices  and\nCharitable Solicitations by Law Enforcement Officers\" provide\nthe following:\n\n     109.1    SOLICITATIONS  THAT  TANGIBLY BENEFIT  LAW\n     ENFORCEMENT\n\n          A   solicitation  tangibly   benefits  a   law\n     enforcement agency, officer, or association if  the\n     proceeds of that solicitation are used, represented\n     to be used, or intended to be used to support a law\n     enforcement  program   or  purpose   which  a   law\n     enforcement agency  or association  otherwise would\n     have  to fund through  its own budgeting mechanism.\n     Examples  of solicitations  which tangibly  benefit\n     law enforcement are as follows:  (1) A solicitation\n     which raises  money from  community members  to pay\n     for  the purchase of  equipment for a  local police\n     department; (2) A  solicitation to send an  officer\n     into school classrooms  to conduct anti-drug  abuse\n     training (the money paying for the officer's salary\n     and   for  education   materials);   and  (3)   The\n     solicitation of funds for erection of a monument to\n     memorialize slain officers, which was permitted  by\n     prior law, Priv. &amp; Spec. Laws 1989, ch. 47.\n\n     109.2  SOLICITATIONS THAT  DO NOT TANGIBLY  BENEFIT\n     LAW ENFORCEMENT\n\n          A   solicitation   of   money   for   purposes\n     completely  unrelated to  law enforcement,  such as\n     for  a charity  unrelated to law  enforcement, does\n     not confer a  tangible benefit  on law  enforcement\n     even if the solicitation effort increases good will\n     toward law  enforcement.   For  example, if  police\n     officers  engage  in  solicitations  of  money  for\n     earthquake  victims in South America, and if no law\n     enforcement   agency,   officer,   or   association\n     receives, is intended to receive, or is represented\n     to receive any of the proceeds of the solicitation,\n     then that  solicitation program  will not  tangibly\n                                              \n     benefit law enforcement.\n\n                             -10-\n\n          Plaintiffs  brought the  present suit  on September\n\n27, 1991,  seeking a  declaratory judgment  that    3702-A is\n\nboth  facially   unconstitutional  and   unconstitutional  as\n\napplied.    Preliminary  and  permanent  injunctions  against\n\nenforcement of    3702-A were requested.   Several plaintiffs\n\nalleged  that they  wanted to  solicit  advertising from  the\n\nbusiness  community  and  to place  those  advertisements  in\n\npolice magazines like the \"Maine State Trooper,\" and that the\n\nAct  prohibited this  conduct.   According  to plaintiffs,   \n\n3702-A  violates the First  and Fourteenth Amendments because\n\nit   is   unconstitutionally   overbroad,   serves   as    an\n\nimpermissible prior restraint on their freedom of speech, and\n\ndenies to them the equal protection of the laws.\n\n          The  district court  held  that  the provision  for\n\nenforcement of the  Act through injunctive relief  created an\n\nimpermissible  prior  restraint.   Otherwise,  it  upheld the\n\nconstitutionality of    3702-A.   See Auburn Police  Union v.\n                                                          \n\nCarpenter  (\"Auburn  II\"), 798  F. Supp.  819 (D.  Me. 1992).\n         \n\nPlaintiffs appeal, arguing that the Act is unconstitutionally\n\noverinclusive and underinclusive.   Maine argues in  response\n\nthat the United  States Supreme Court's summary  dismissal of\n\nthe  appeal in  MSTA must  be  accorded binding  precedential\n                    \n\neffect on the  issues of overbreadth and  underinclusiveness.\n\nEven  if the  Supreme  Court's  summary  dismissal  does  not\n\n                    \n\nMe. Dep't of Att'y Gen. ch. 109.\n\n                             -11-\n\ncontrol, Maine  argues  that the  Act  must still  be  upheld\n\nbecause  it  is  narrowly  tailored  to  serve  a  compelling\n\ninterest.    Maine  also appeals  from  the  district court's\n\ndeclaration that the  injunctive relief provision constitutes\n\nan impermissible prior restraint. \n\n                             II.\n\n          This appeal presents difficult  questions.  We must\n\ndecide,  first, what  issues are  foreclosed  by the  Supreme\n\nCourt's  dismissal  for want  of  a federal  question  of the\n\nappeal  in MSTA.   And,  if any  of the First  and Fourteenth\n               \n\nAmendment issues raised  by appellants are not  foreclosed by\n\nMSTA, we must decide them.\n    \n\n          In  the enabling  Act, the  Maine  Legislature said\n\nthat the Act: \n\n          clarifies and reaffirms  that the primary\n          and  compelling  purpose  underlying  the\n          laws   governing   solicitation   by  law\n          enforcement officers is  to eliminate the\n          coercion    that    is     inherent    in\n          solicitations  by and  on  behalf of  law\n          enforcement officers by  prohibiting such\n          solicitations.   When  a law  enforcement\n          officer  solicits   from  a   prospective\n          donor,  the  donor may  not  feel totally\n          free to  reject the  request in light  of\n          the officer's position . . . .\n\nPriv. &amp;  Spec. Laws 1991,  Ch. 510   5.   We set  forth in an\n\nappendix the full text of this section of the enabling Act.\n\n          In challenging  the Act, appellants contend it goes\n\nfar beyond what is constitutionally permissible and necessary\n\nto   address  whatever   valid  concerns   exist  about   the\n\n                             -12-\n\ncoerciveness of police solicitations.  Appellants insist that\n\nsuch dangers,  if any, must  be regulated more  narrowly, for\n\nexample, by legislation prohibiting  solicitation by officers\n\nin uniform,  or requiring that  solicitation be done  only by\n\npersons who are not themselves police officers.   The present\n\ntotal  ban on solicitation by  any \"person\" when the property\n\nor any  part of it \"in any way tangibly benefits, is intended\n\nto tangibly benefit or is  represented to be for the tangible\n\nbenefit  of  any  law  enforcement  officer  . . . agency  or\n\n. . . association,\" is  said to be  unconstitutionally broad,\n\nforeclosing  innocent  actions  and  speech  that  could  not\n\npossibly cause any of the evils the Maine Legislature  fears.\n\nFor   example,  the  Act  would  bar  placing  an  unattended\n\ncollection box for  a police charity in a  public place, even\n\nthough doing this could not, appellants say, exert a coercive\n\ninfluence.   Appellants say that  the Act does not  adopt, as\n\nthe  First Amendment requires, the least restrictive means to\n\naddress  the evil  of police  coercion;  that it  is a  prior\n\nrestraint, not  only  because  of  the  conferred  injunctive\n\npowers but because of its overall scheme; and that it offends\n\nother constitutional principles.\n\n          These  issues are not easy given the protection our\n\nConstitution  affords speech  and speech-related  activities.\n\nNonetheless, we conclude that the Maine  Legislature's effort\n\nto deal with the dangers of police solicitation is within its\n\n                             -13-\n\nconstitutional authority.   We hold that the  Supreme Court's\n\ndismissal of  the MSTA appeal  is binding on  the overbreadth\n                      \n\nissue, and that  appellants' remaining constitutional  claims\n\nare insufficient.\n\n          A.

In such\n\na  case, we  review the  district  court's determinations  de\n                                                             \n\nnovo.  Brewer v.

Maine   denies  that   the  Act   is\n\ncontent-based, arguing that    3702-A prohibits only  the act\n                                                             \n\nof  soliciting  for  something  that  tangibly  benefits  law\n\nenforcement.   According  to the  State, the  content  of the\n\nsolicitation    i.e., whether the  message is that funds  are\n\nneeded for more equipment, to advocate strengthening the drug\n\nlaws, or to promote capital punishment  legislation    is not\n\nrelevant to   3702-A's ban on solicitation.\n\n          But while the Act may not regulate the details of a\n\ngiven solicitation, the fact remains that it applies to,  and\n\nprohibits, only certain  types of solicitation, necessitating\n\nan  examination of the content of  each solicitation in order\n\nto determine whether  the Act's criteria are implicated.  The\n\nSupreme Court has  pointed to \"the reality  that solicitation\n\n                             -15-\n\nis  characteristically   intertwined  with   informative  and\n\nperhaps persuasive  speech  seeking  support  for  particular\n\ncauses or  for particular  views on  economic, political,  or\n\nsocial  issues, and for the reality that without solicitation\n\nthe  flow of  such  information  and  advocacy  would  likely\n\ncease.\"   Shaumburg v.

Like the court below, we conclude that the\n\nAct falls on the side  of content-based regulation.  As such,\n\nit  is  subject  to  \"exacting  First  Amendment  scrutiny.\"9\n\nRiley v. National Fed'n of the Blind, Inc., 487 U.S. 781, 788\n                                          \n\n(1988).\n\n          B.

Perhaps it might be argued    although Maine has not done\nso     that the  Act is content-neutral  because it  seeks to\nprevent only the harmful \"secondary effects\" of solicitation,\ni.e., the implied coercion inherent in solicitation on behalf\nof  law enforcement  personnel, with  the  resulting loss  of\nintegrity.   Restrictions based on the content of speech that\nseek to regulate  only the \"secondary effects\"  of the speech\nhave,  in  certain  situations,  been deemed  content-neutral\nbecause they \"serve purposes unrelated to the content  of the\nexpression.\"  Ward v. Rock  Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791\n                                          \n(1989);  see Renton v.

But  even if\n                       \nthis argument had not been  waived, it is doubtful that these\ncases,  involving  very   dissimilar  facts  and   regulatory\nschemes, would  apply here.  Cf.

Ct. at 2549\n                                        \n(listeners' reactions to speech are not \"secondary effects\").\nIn  any event,  we need  not enter  into the  thicket of  the\n\"secondary effects\" doctrine, as we conclude, infra, that, to\n                                                   \nthe  extent not  controlled by  the  Supreme Court's  summary\ndismissal of the  MSTA appeal, the Act survives the stringent\n                      \nscrutiny applicable to content-based regulation.\n\n                             -16-\n\n          We  move  to  Maine's  argument  that  the  summary\n\ndismissal  of the appeal in MSTA by  the Supreme Court of the\n                                \n\nUnited States is  entitled to binding precedential  effect on\n\nthe issues of overbreadth and underinclusiveness.10  \n\n          The  Supreme  Court's  summary  disposition  of  an\n\nappeal to  it is an  adjudication on the merits  that must be\n\nfollowed  by lower courts,  subject, of course,  to any later\n\ndevelopments  that alter  or erode  its authority.

We need, therefore, to\n       \n\ndetermine  the \"reach  and content\"  of  the Supreme  Court's\n\ndismissal of  the appeal  in MSTA for  want of  a substantial\n                                 \n\nfederal question.

Instead,  we   should  examine   the\n\njurisdictional  statement filed in  the Supreme Court  of the\n\nUnited States and  any other relevant aid to  construction in\n\norder   to  ascertain   what   issues  were   \"presented  and\n\nnecessarily decided\" by the Court's summary dismissal.12 \n\n          Examining   the   MSTA   jurisdictional  statement,\n                                \n\ntogether  with the accompanying papers filed with the Supreme\n\nCourt and the opinions of  the lower courts, we conclude that\n\nappellants in MSTA specifically presented the issue of facial\n                  \n\noverbreadth,  including  whether  the  Act  was broader  than\n\njustified  by the underlying  state interest, to  the Supreme\n\nCourt.  We think the Court was obliged to have considered and\n\n                    \n\n12.  Besides contesting whether the current case presents the\nsame  issues that were  involved in MSTA,  plaintiffs contend\n                                        \nthat  the  facts  in  the  instant case  and  MSTA  are  very\n                                                  \ndifferent; that MSTA deviated from established constitutional\n                    \nprinciples  and   broke  new  ground;   and  that   doctrinal\ndevelopments have  undercut the  precedential value  of MSTA.\n                                                            \nLike  the district  court in  Auburn I,  we find  these three\n                                      \ncontentions lack merit.   756 F.  Supp. at 614.   Unlike  the\ncourt in  Auburn I,  however, we also  conclude that  MSTA is\n                                                          \nentitled  to binding  precedential  value  on  the  issue  of\nsubstantial overbreadth.\n\n                             -19-\n\nto have rejected this issue  as a predicate to its dismissing\n\nof the  appeal for  want of  a substantial  federal question.\n\nThe issue of so-called underinclusiveness, however,  does not\n\nso clearly appear in the papers, and later changes in the Act\n\nfurther  erode the  present  bearing of  MSTA on  that topic.\n                                             \n\nTherefore, the  dismissal in  MSTA is binding  upon us  as to\n                                  \n\noverbreadth, but is not binding as to underinclusiveness, nor\n\nbinding as to certain \"as applied\" issues the plaintiffs have\n\nraised.  We turn first to overbreadth.\n\n          In  the strict sense, overbreadth is a doctrine for\n\nfacially invalidating  a statute  that is  \"so broad  that it\n\n'may inhibit the  constitutionally protected speech  of third\n\nparties.'\"  N.Y. State Club Ass'n v. New York, 487 U.S. 1, 11\n                                             \n\n(1988) (quoting  Members of City  Council of  Los Angeles  v.\n                                                         \n\nTaxpayers for Vincent,  466 U.S. 789,  798 (1984)); Regan  v.\n                                                         \n\nTime, Inc.,  468 U.S. 641, 651 n.7 (1984).

The  overbreadth \"must not only  be real,\n\nbut substantial as well, judged in relation to the  statute's\n\nplainly legitimate sweep.\"  New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747,\n                                              \n\n770 (1982). \n\n          Plaintiffs  argue that the Act is overbroad in this\n\nclassic sense.   For example,  without themselves necessarily\n\n                             -20-\n\nwishing  to engage in such conduct, they note that solicitors\n\nmay wish  to put out  unattended collection boxes  to receive\n\npolice  donations.   This, they  say,  would be  noncoercive,\n\nsince  no one would know  who donated or  did not donate, yet\n\nthe  Act would prohibit it.   Similarly, plaintiffs point out\n\nthat  hypothetical  private  citizens,  unconnected with  the\n\npolice, are prevented by the Act from soliciting donations to\n\nlaw   enforcement  from   friends       for  instance,   from\n\nvoluntarily soliciting funds to buy a new cruiser for a local\n\ndepartment.   This, too, is said to be  an example of how the\n\nAct  sweeps too  broadly,  prohibiting protected  conduct  by\n\nthird parties.13  \n\n          Classic  overbreadth,  however,   was  an  argument\n\nspecifically  presented  to  the Supreme  Court  in  the MSTA\n                                                             \n\nappeal  and necessarily  rejected by  its  dismissal of  that\n\nappeal for want of a substantial federal question.\n\n                    \n\n13.  One can  also hypothesize, for  purposes of  overbreadth\nanalysis, other arguably unconstitutional applications of the\nAct.   For  example, the  Act might  be construed  to prevent\nprivate citizens  from asking for  money to lobby for  a bill\nthat  raises police  salaries.   However,  because the  Act's\nprohibition runs only against fundraising for  the \"tangible\"\nbenefit  of  law  enforcement, the  Maine  courts  might well\nreject  any such  interpretation.  Speculative readings  like\nthis would seem best decided,  if ever sought to be enforced,\nin an  \"as-applied\"  lawsuit,  rather  than  hypothesized  in\nadvance  for purposes of facial overbreadth analysis.  In any\ncase, as  discussed infra,  we consider  the issue of  facial\n                         \noverbreadth to be  foreclosed by the Supreme  Court's summary\ndismissal of the MSTA appeal.  \n                     \n\n                             -21-\n\n          When so  dismissing, the  Supreme Court  had before\n\nit,  both in M.S.T.A.'s  jurisdictional statement and  in its\n\nnotice  of appeal, appellants'  explicit contention  that the\n\nAct  was overbroad.   And,  as noted  supra, the  Law Court's\n                                           \n\nunderlying  opinion from  which appeal  was  being taken  had\n\nspecifically discussed and rejected  overbreadth as a  ground\n\nfor invalidating the Act.\n\n          It is true  that in first describing  the questions\n\npresented on appeal,  M.S.T.A.'s jurisdictional statement    \n\nafter  setting  out the  terms  of  the  Act     defined  the\n\nquestion only as  whether or not the Act  \"violates the First\n\nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\"\n\nLater,  however, under  the heading  of  \"Stated Reasons  for\n\nPlenary  Consideration,\" the  jurisdictional statement  urged\n\nupon the Court the desirability of its being able to question\n\ncounsel as  to  \"the overbreadth  doctrine.\"   In a  footnote\n\nappended to that suggestion, M.S.T.A. stated,\n\n          \"From the outset,  appellant has asserted\n          the  overbreadth  doctrine  of  NAACP  v.\n                                               \n          Button, 371 U.S. 415 (1963).\"  \n                \n\nIn NAACP, the Court had stated, among other comments relevant\n        \n\nto  overbreadth,  \"Furthermore,  the instant  decree  may  be\n\ninvalid  if  it  prohibits   privileged  exercises  of  First\n\nAmendment rights whether or not the record disclosed that the\n\npetitioner has engaged in privileged conduct.\"  Id. at 432.  \n                                                   \n\n                             -22-\n\n          That overbreadth was specifically presented to, and\n\nrejected by, the  Supreme Court is underscored  by M.S.T.A.'s\n\nstatement in its  notice of appeal to the  Supreme Court that\n\nappeal was taken from the portion of the Law Court's decision\n\nthat \"the  statute in question  is not overbroad.\"   We find,\n\ntherefore, that in denying the MSTA appeal, the Supreme Court\n                                   \n\nwas  expressly  presented  with,   and  must  therefore  have\n\nrejected,  the argument  that  the  Act was  unconstitutional\n\nunder the First Amendment because of overbreadth.  \n\n          We  think  the  Court's  rejection  of  overbreadth\n\nsubsumed, besides the \"classic\" overbreadth described  above,\n\nanother common variety of facial overbreadth claim.  The term\n\n\"overbreadth\" is used in First Amendment contexts not only to\n\ninvalidate  statutes that  are  so broad  as  to inhibit  the\n\nconstitutionally protected  speech of  third parties,  supra,\n                                                            \n\nbut  to facially invalidate statutes that inhibit free speech\n\nand  are  unsupported  by  a  sufficiently  compelling  state\n\ninterest or are  not tailored narrowly  to such an  interest.\n\nSee Secretary of  Maryland v.

We so  conclude\n\nnot  alone from  the Law  Court's own  ruling in  MSTA, which\n                                                      \n\nexpressly  found both  a compelling  state  interest and  the\n\nrequisite  narrow tailoring, but from express language in the\n\njurisdictional statement submitted by M.S.T.A. when appealing\n\nto the  Supreme Court  from the Law  Court's ruling.  In that\n\nstatement, as already  noted, the terms of the challenged Act\n\nwere  set  forth  and  an  appeal  on  First  and  Fourteenth\n\nAmendment grounds noted.   M.S.T.A. then went on to  complain\n\nthat the  Law Court had held that the Act \"in fact interferes\n\nwith  First  Amendment freedoms,  but  that compelling  state\n\ninterests  exist which  permit the  interference.\"   M.S.T.A.\n\ncharacterized  the  Law  Court's version  of  the  compelling\n\ninterest as \"the  interest of the State  in the image of  its\n\n                    \n\n14.  As later sections of this opinion demonstrate, we do not\nregard the  Court's denial of  appeal in MSTA as  barring our\n                                             \nconsideration  of  claims  attacking the  sufficiency  of the\nState's  compelling  interest   based  on  underinclusiveness\n(equal protection) grounds.\n\n                             -24-\n\nlaw enforcement officers\" and as \"an intangible harm\" allowed\n\nin  the Law Court  to \"deprive law  enforcement associations,\n\nand others, of  protected First Amendment rights.\"   M.S.T.A.\n\nurged summary  reversal because  the \"Law  Court, absent  any\n\nevidence  of actual or perceived coercion, apparently assumed\n\nthe  compelling state  interest  into  existence  based  upon\n\ncomments  in the legislative  history of the  Act.\"  M.S.T.A.\n\nurged the  Supreme Court     if unwilling to reverse  the Law\n\nCourt summarily    to question counsel as to \"the broad sweep\n\nof the State's alleged compelling interest, together with the\n\nappellant's assertion of the 'overbreadth doctrine.'\"   These\n\nstatements  were prefaced  by mention  of  the trial  court's\n\nfinding  that appellants  had  not engaged  \"in  any form  of\n\ncoercion or otherwise used their official position to solicit\n\nadvertising,\"  a comment supportive of other remarks that the\n\nLaw Court had  rested the State's compelling  interest solely\n\non  a need  to conserve  the \"image\"  of its  law enforcement\n\nofficers.\n\n          We think  the above statements  necessarily alerted\n\nthe Supreme  Court to a  claim of \"overbreadth\" based  on the\n\nnotion that the Act's burdens on speech went beyond any truly\n\ncompelling state interest.\n\n          The  challenged  language  of  the present  Act  is\n\nvirtually identical in  all material respects to  the statute\n\nfound to  be  constitutional in  MSTA.   The  key  difference\n                                     \n\n                             -25-\n\nbetween the current  version of the Act, Me.  Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 25,   3702-A, and the prior version of the Act, Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 25,    3702, is that the current version  now\n\nprovides that  the prohibition on  solicitation applies  only\n\nwhen  solicitation \"tangibly\"  benefits  any law  enforcement\n\nofficer, agency or  association.  This clarifies  that police\n\nsolicitation   for  charitable   causes   unrelated  to   law\n\nenforcement is not barred.   Arguably, under the old  statute\n\nsuch solicitation was barred because  it intangibly benefited\n\nlaw  enforcement  by  providing good  will.    Even assuming,\n\nhowever, that the  addition of the word  \"tangible\" to modify\n\n\"benefits\" in the present version worked a substantive change\n\nin  the law,  that change  only narrowed  the breadth  of the\n\nAct's prohibition.   Because    3702-A is even  narrower than\n\nthe  former   3702, the  Supreme Court's summary dismissal of\n\nMSTA, in  which the  Supreme Court  necessarily rejected  the\n    \n\noverbreadth  and  compelling  interest  challenges  described\n\nabove, is binding precedent on whether    3702-A is overbroad\n\nin  the senses  just discussed.

As  the  magistrate  judge  wrote  in   his  Recommended\nDecision:  \"the proverbial egg cannot be unscrambled.\"  \n\n                             -28-\n\nsolicitations  that  intangibly  benefit  the  police,  e.g.,\n\nsolicitations  by police officers  for a public  charity; (2)\n\nthe  Act permits solicitations  that benefit  state officials\n\nother than law enforcement officers;  and (3) The Act permits\n\nsolicitations   on  behalf   of   law  enforcement   officers\n\ncampaigning for public office.  While the latter distinctions\n\nwere present  in the statute upheld in MSTA, the issue of the\n                                           \n\nAct's  alleged  underinclusiveness  and  its  effect  on  the\n\ncompelling  state interest supporting the Act were not raised\n\nin either the Maine courts or in the jurisdictional statement\n\nto  the Supreme  Court.17   Because  the issue  of the  Act's\n\npurported underinclusiveness was not presented to the Supreme\n\nCourt in MSTA, the Supreme  Court's summary dismissal of that\n             \n\ncase is  not binding precedent  on this issue.   See Illinois\n                                                             \n\nState Bd.  of Elections,  440 U.S.  at 183 (\"Questions  which\n                       \n\nmerely lurk in the record are not resolved, and no resolution\n\nof them may be inferred.\") (internal quotation omitted).\n\n          The  State  contends   that  the  Act's   purported\n\nunderinclusiveness  does not render it unconstitutional.  The\n\nState relies,  as did  the district court,  on the  Hatch Act\n\ncases,  see,  e.g.,  United  States  Civil  Serv.

In the  Hatch Act  cases, the\n\nSupreme  Court  upheld  restrictions  on  partisan  political\n\nactivity  by  civil  servants  even  though  other  types  of\n\npolitical activity were not similarly restricted.  But, while\n\nhelpful to  some degree, the Hatch  Act cases are not  on all\n\nfours.  The  Hatch Act cases  rest upon the  notion that  the\n\ngovernment has special rights to restrict  partisan political\n\nspeech of its  employees and on its property.

The Hatch  Act cases  are inapplicable  to the\n\nquestion   of  whether   a   statute  is   unconstitutionally\n\nunderinclusive when that statute, like the Maine Act at issue\n\nhere, restricts  the speech of the general  citizenry as well\n\nas that of public employees.\n\n          When a content-based regulation restricts both  the\n\nspeech  of public  employees and  the  general citizenry,  it\n\n\"simply  cannot  be  defended  on  the  ground  that  partial\n\n                             -30-\n\nprohibitions may effect  partial relief.\"  Florida  Star, 491\n                                                        \n\nU.S. at  540.

See,  e.g.,\n                                                       \n     Williamson v. Lee  Optical Co., 348 U.S.  483, 488-\n                                   \n     489   (1955).     This  presumption   of  statutory\n     validity,   however,   has   less   force  when   a\n     classification  turns  on  the  subject  matter  of\n     expression.  \"[A]bove all else, the First Amendment\n     means  that government  has  no  power to  restrict\n     expression because  of its message,  its ideas, its\n     subject matter, or  its content.\"  Police  Dept. of\n                                                        \n     Chicago v.

While  the\n\nSupreme  Court has occasionally  cited the lack  of empirical\n\nevidence as a further ground  for striking down a restriction\n\non  speech,  see,  e.g.,  Peel  v.  Attorney  Registration  &amp;\n                                                             \n\nDisciplinary  Comm'n,  496  U.S. 91,  106  (1990) (plurality)\n                    \n\n(\"Given the complete  absence of any evidence  of deception,\"\n\nCourt rejects state's contention that attorney's  advertising\n\nwas actually misleading),  the Court  has never  laid down  a\n\ncategorical  rule requiring that  empirical evidence be shown\n\nto  support every  statutory  restriction  on  speech.20    A\n\ncategorical  requirement would be unwise, we think, given the\n\ndifficulty  of  securing  definitive empirical  evidence  for\n\nunquantifiable issues of this sort. \n\n          The    Maine    Legislature's    conclusion   seems\n\nintuitively reasonable that  solicitations    even when  made\n\nby  law  enforcement  personnel      for charitable  purposes\n\nunrelated to law  enforcement are not as  inherently coercive\n\nas  solicitations  that   tangibly  benefit  law  enforcement\n\nofficers, agencies  or associations.

The police  occupy a\n\nunique role.   They are empowered to enforce  a wide array of\n\ncriminal laws  and to protect  the property and lives  of the\n\ngeneral citizenry.  To do this they are armed, given enhanced\n\narrest powers, and  given access to information  networks and\n\nother tools denied to most citizens.  Police necessarily have\n\nconsiderable on-the-spot authority of a discretionary sort   \n\nwhether  to give  or withhold  a traffic  ticket, to  make an\n\narrest, or to  notice or disregard a violation.   While even-\n\nhanded  treatment is the  ideal, officers may,  and sometimes\n\ndo, enforce  laws in  a less than  neutral manner.   For this\n\nreason, citizens and local businesses will try to stay on the\n\ngood side of  police, fearing    whether or  not correctly   \n\nthat   a  miffed  police  officer  and  his  associates  will\n\nretaliate, or will turn their backs when most needed.  Hence,\n\n                             -36-\n\nthe Maine  Legislature could reasonably conclude  that police\n\nsolicitation has a special potential for coercion not present\n\nin solicitation by other officials.  \n\n          Plaintiffs'  third example  of the  Act's purported\n\nunderinclusiveness     the  exception  for  solicitations  on\n\nbehalf  of law enforcement officers running for public office\n\n    is  also  unavailing.

We,\n                           \n\ntherefore,  agree  with  the district  court  that  the First\n\nAmendment  right of  law enforcement  officers  to engage  in\n\ncampaign speech provides a substantial  justification for the\n\nAct's  exemption of  such  speech  from  its  prohibition  on\n\n                             -37-\n\nsolicitation.21    See   Austin,  494  U.S.  at   668  (media\n                               \n\nexemption from  prohibition  on  corporations  using  general\n\ntreasury funds to support state candidate  elections \"ensures\n\nthat the  Act does  not hinder  or prevent  the institutional\n\npress from  reporting on,  and  publishing editorials  about,\n\nnewsworthy events\").\n\n          As  the State can  furnish \"clear reasons\"  for the\n\nasserted  exemptions from  the  Act's  prohibitions, and  the\n\nreasons are  not only  clear but rational,  we hold  that the\n\nMaine Act is not unconstitutionally underinclusive.\n\n          D. As Applied Challenge\n                                 \n\n          Plaintiffs argue that  the Act is  unconstitutional\n\nas applied to the activities  of plaintiff R.H. McKnight Co.,\n\na professional  fundraiser and  publisher of  law enforcement\n\n                    \n\n21.  To   the  extent  that  coercion  is  caused  by  police\nsolicitations  for   campaign  fundraising,  the   State  has\nattempted  to minimize it by imposing certain restrictions on\nsuch solicitations.   For example, Me.  Rev. Stat. Ann.  tit.\n25,      3711  prohibits  solicitations  by  law  enforcement\nofficers while  in uniform.   Section 3712 prohibits  any law\nenforcement officer  running for a nonpartisan  public office\nfrom  soliciting on his own behalf.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\n25,   3712.   Section 3713 prohibits  the use of  coercion in\nsolicitations.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 25,   3713.  Section\n3714 makes a violation of these restrictions a Class E crime.\nMe.  Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 25,    3714.  Other restrictions on\nlaw enforcement  officers  running for  elective  office  are\ncontained  in  statute,  union  contracts  and   departmental\nregulations.   See  Me.  Rev.  Stat. Ann.  tit.  30-A,    355\n                  \n(Pamph. 1991) (regulating political  activity of sheriffs and\ndeputy sheriffs).   Together, these restrictions serve  as an\neffective accommodation of  the First Amendment right  of the\npolice  to  engage  in  political  speech  with  the  State's\ninterest  in   preventing   coercion   inherent   in   police\nsolicitation.\n\n                             -38-\n\nmagazines; plaintiff Charles Underwood, a private citizen who\n\nwishes  to advertise in  such magazines;22 and  the plaintiff\n\nlaw  enforcement association which  wishes to disseminate the\n\nmagazines.23     Plaintiffs   contend   that  the   sale   of\n\nadvertising in law  enforcement publications like  the \"Maine\n\nState  Trooper\"  is  a noncoercive  undertaking.   Plaintiffs\n\npoint specifically to the allegedly noncoercive nature of the\n\nsystem  of solicitation  designed by  R.H.  McKnight Co.,  in\n\nwhich telephone solicitors supposedly make it clear that they\n\nare not police  officers, and the names of persons who do not\n\npurchase  advertisements are  not  directly released  to  the\n\nsponsoring law enforcement organization.24\n\n                    \n\n22.  We  note that  plaintiff  Underwood  can  raise  no  \"as\napplied\"  challenge with regard to his  right to advertise in\nthe  police magazines, as  the statute does  not prohibit him\nfrom  advertising but from being  solicited to advertise.  As\n                                           \nsuch, his  claim is  rightly considered  along with  those of\nplaintiff R.H. McKnight Co. and the plaintiff law enforcement\nassociation.\n\n23.  It  is debatable  whether plaintiffs  can  bring an  as-\napplied  challenge  in  the  context  of  a   pre-enforcement\ndeclaratory  judgment action.  See United States v. Gaudreau,\n                                                            \n860  F.2d 357,  360-61 (10th  Cir. 1988)  (\"In  a declaratory\njudgment action no  one has been charged so  the court cannot\nevaluate the statute as applied.\").  Rather  than embark upon\ntechnicalities,  however,   we  prefer   to  consider   their\narguments on the merits.\n\n24.    A  sample script utilized  by R.H.

The   International\n     Brotherhood of  Police Officers  Local #  414 is  a\n     non-profit   organization,    not   a    charitable\n     organization.    Therefore,  your  payment  can  be\n\n                             -40-\n\n          Contrary to  plaintiffs' view,  we think  the Maine\n\nLegislature could believe that solicitation of advertisements\n\nto benefit law enforcement is inherently coercive because the\n\npersons  solicited will  experience  pressure to  purchase an\n\nadvertisement so that  their support of law  enforcement will\n\nbecome known  to police or  so that their  failure to  buy an\n\nadvertisement will  not be  noticed.   The Legislature  could\n\nreasonably  doubt   that  the   solicitations  would   become\n\nnoncoercive  merely  because the  names of  those who  do not\n\npurchase  advertisements were promised not to be disclosed to\n\nthe police.  The advertisements will be public.  Accordingly,\n\nlaw enforcement  officers will  be aware  of who  contributed\n\nand,  by  the  absence  of advertisements,  of  who  did  not\n\ncontribute.   Moreover, those solicited may not believe, even\n\nif  they  are   assured,  that  their   names  will  not   be\n\ncommunicated.   The Law Court in  MSTA was of the  view that,\n                                      \n\nquite apart  from  actual coercion,  the  state's  legitimate\n\ninterest included  maintaining the good  public reputation of\n\n                    \n\n     deducted as an advertising expense only.  Thank you\n     for your support.  With your help we are able to go\n     forward.   The telephone call you received was from\n     a representative of the publishing company and  not\n     a member of the Police Department.  Officers do not\n     elect  to solicit as  it may unduly  influence your\n     decision.   If you have any questions, please don't\n     hesitate to ask.\n\n                             -41-\n\nits   police.    We   are  not  persuaded   that  plaintiffs'\n\nalternatives would necessarily answer that concern.\n\n          Because plaintiffs'  proposed solicitations  remain\n\ninherently coercive, or at least do not remove the appearance\n\nof  coercion and  favoritism, we reject  plaintiffs' argument\n\nthat the Act is unconstitutional as applied.\n\n          E. Prior Restraint\n                            \n\n          Any   violation  of   the   Act's  prohibition   on\n\nsolicitation  that  tangibly  benefits   law  enforcement  is\n\nconsidered  a violation of  the Maine Unfair  Trade Practices\n\nAct.  Me.  Rev. Stat. tit. 25,   3702-A.  The Act, therefore,\n\ncan  be enforced either through civil penalties or injunctive\n\nrelief.     Finding  that  enforcement  of  the  Act  through\n\ninjunctive  relief would  constitute  an impermissible  prior\n\nrestraint, the district court  declared the injunctive relief\n\nprovision  of the Act  to be  unconstitutional.25   While the\n\n                    \n\n25.  Plaintiffs actually argued to the district court, and to\nthis  court,  that  the  Act's  categorical   prohibition  on\nsolicitation,   in    and   of    itself,   constitutes    an\nunconstitutional prior  restraint.  According  to plaintiffs,\nthe Act constitutes a prior restraint because it \"silences by\nfiat  an entire category of charitable solicitation.\"  Auburn\n                                                             \nI, 756 F. Supp.  at 618.  In this respect,  argue plaintiffs,\n \nthe Act  is \"a form  of censorship; it prejudges  rather than\npunishes after the  fact.\"  Id.   Plaintiffs further  contend\n                               \nthat  barring   solicitation  of  funds  is   a  particularly\neffective  prior restraint  because law  enforcement agencies\nwill not have the financial resources to spread their message\nto the general public.\n     The  district   court  correctly   rejected  plaintiffs'\narguments  that the  entire Act  should be  invalidated  as a\nprior restraint.    Under plaintiffs'  analysis,  almost  any\nregulation  of speech would  be considered a  prior restraint\n\n                             -42-\n\ndistrict   court's  concern   that  injunctions   are  rarely\n\ntolerated in the  First Amendment context is  understandable,\n\nwe think the court acted improperly in invalidating the Act's\n\ninjunctive relief provision on its face.\n\n          A prior restraint  is a government  regulation that\n\nlimits or  conditions in  advance the  exercise of  protected\n\nFirst Amendment activity.

Although the  classic  form  of  prior restraint\n\ninvolves  an  administrative licensing  scheme, see  Jews for\n                                                             \n\nJesus, Inc.  v.

While the  Supreme Court has  cautioned that\n\"[b]road  prophylactic rules in  the area of  free expression\nare suspect,\"   Riley, 487 U.S.  at 801, the Court  has never\n                     \nsaid that  a  categorical ban  on speech  is a  per se  prior\nrestraint.    Instead, the  Court  has,  for  the most  part,\ncarefully   limited   the   prior   restraint   doctrine   to\nadministrative and judicial orders prohibiting speech  before\nit is actually uttered.\n\n                             -43-\n\n714  (1971); Organization for  a Better Austin  v.

The  Supreme Court has\n\nexplained the rationale behind this heavy presumption against\n\nprior restraints as follows:\n\n          Behind the distinction is a theory deeply\n          etched  in  our  law:    a  free  society\n          prefers  to  punish  the  few  who  abuse\n          rights of speech after they break the law\n                                \n          than  to  throttle  them and  all  others\n          beforehand.   It is  always difficult  to\n          know in  advance what an  individual will\n          say, and the  line between legitimate and\n          illegitimate  speech is  often so  finely\n          drawn  that  the  risks  of  freewheeling\n          censorship are formidable.\n\nSoutheastern Promotions Ltd., 420 U.S. at 559.\n                            \n\n          The Supreme  Court, however, \"has  never held  that\n\nall  injunctions are impermissible.\"  Pittsburgh Press Co. v.\n                                                          \n\nPittsburgh  Comm'n  on  Human Relations,  413  U.S.  376, 390\n                                       \n\n(1973).   \"The  special vice  of  a prior  restraint is  that\n\ncommunication  will  be  suppressed, either  directly  or  by\n\ninducing excessive caution in the speaker, before an adequate\n\ndetermination that it is unprotected by the First Amendment.\"\n\nId.   An injunction that  is narrowly tailored, based  upon a\n   \n\n                             -44-\n\ncontinuing  course of  repetitive  speech,  and granted  only\n\nafter a final  adjudication on the merits that  the speech is\n\nunprotected does not constitute an unlawful  prior restraint.\n\nSee  id.; Securities  &amp;  Exchange Comm'n  v.  Wall St.  Publ.\n                                                             \n\nInstitute, Inc.,  851 F.2d  365, 370 (D.C.  Cir. 1988).   The\n               \n\nMaine  courts may interpret the statute  or apply it so as to\n\navoid  the issuance of  ex parte  restraining orders  or even\n\ntemporary injunctions,  using  their  equitable  powers  only\n\nfollowing full hearings and final adjudications.\n\n          Because plaintiffs brought this action seeking pre-\n\nenforcement  declaratory relief,  there  is, at  present,  no\n\ninjunction  restraining  solicitation  activities.    Without\n\nhaving  before  us  the  concrete  example  of  a  particular\n\ninjunction, it  is difficult, if  not impossible,  for us  to\n\ndetermine whether the prior restraint doctrine has or will be\n\nviolated.26   See American  Library Ass'n  v.

Injunctions, in  this respect, are  distinguishable from\nadministrative  licensing   schemes  that   constitute  prior\nrestraints.   \"[W]hen  a  licensing statute  vests  unbridled\ndiscretion in a government official over whether to permit or\ndeny expressive activity,  one who is subject to  the law may\nchallenge it facially without the necessity of first applying\nfor, and being denied, a  license.\"  Lakewood v.

The  court's  declaration  that  the  Act's\n             \n\nprovision  for  enforcement  through   injunctive  relief  is\n\nunconstitutional is reversed.  \n                            \n\n          Costs to the State of Maine.\n\n                             -46-\n\n                           APPENDIX\n                                   \n\n                        STATE OF MAINE\n\n     An Act to Amend the Laws Concerning Solicitation by\n                   Law Enforcement Officers\n\nBe it enacted by the People of the State of Maine as follows:\n\n. . . .\n\n          Sec. 5.   Legislative intent.  It is  the intent of\n          Sec. 5.   Legislative intent.\n\nthe Legislature to  repeal all exceptions to  the prohibition\n\nagainst solicitation  by law  enforcement agencies,  officers\n\nand associations.   The  Legislature finds  that the  various\n\nexceptions  to the  prohibition enacted  over  the years,  in\n\nfact,  have led to inherently coercive solicitations and that\n\nthose  exceptions ultimately undermine  the integrity  of law\n\nenforcement.  As a consequence, the Legislature repeals these\n\nexceptions and reenacts  the prohibition on  solicitations by\n\nor  on behalf  of law enforcement.   The  Legislature further\n\nfinds that solicitations for charitable purposes unrelated to\n\nlaw  enforcement  activities  are  not  inherently   coercive\n\nbecause the person  solicited will know that  law enforcement\n\nagencies  or officers do  not gain any  tangible benefit and,\n\nconsequently will  not be concerned  with who donates.   This\n\nAct clarifies and  reaffirms that the primary  and compelling\n\npurpose  underlying the  laws governing  solicitation  by law\n\nenforcement officers  is to  eliminate the  coercion that  is\n\ninherent in solicitations by and on behalf of law enforcement\n\n                             -47-\n\nofficers  by  prohibiting  such solicitations.    When  a law\n\nenforcement officer solicits  from a  prospective donor,  the\n\ndonor  may not  feel totally  free to  reject the  request in\n\nlight of the  officer's position.  This  occurs regardless of\n\nthe   subjective  intent  of   the  officer  to   coerce  the\n\nprospective  donor.    In  addition  to  the  effect  on  the\n\nprospective donor, the  appearance of the transaction  to 3rd\n\npersons may undermine  public confidence in the  integrity of\n\nthe  public  office.   At  least the  appearance  of coercion\n\ninheres in  every  solicitation that  tangibly  benefits  law\n\nenforcement  agents   and  the   appearance  undermines   the\n\nintegrity of  the office.    The Legislature  finds that  the\n\nState has a  compelling interest in preserving  the integrity\n\nof law enforcement officers and finds that regulating all law\n\nenforcement   solicitations   that   tangibly   benefit   law\n\nenforcement  is  necessary to  promote this  compelling state\n\ninterest.\n\n[Priv. &amp; Spec.

The State of Maine\n                                        \n\nhas  enacted  a  law (hereinafter  \"the  Act\")  prohibiting a\n\nperson  from soliciting property from the general public that\n\ntangibly  benefits any  law  enforcement officer,  agency  or\n\nassociation.1     Violations  of  the  Act  are  declared  to\n\ncontravene the Maine Unfair Trade Practices Act, and they may\n\nbe enjoined and penalized civilly.   Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\n\n5,   209 (West 1992).\n\n          Plaintiffs comprise a  coalition of police  unions,\n\nindividual   law   enforcement   officers,   a   professional\n\nfundraiser and a  private citizen.2  They sued  in the United\n\nStates District  Court for the District of  Maine pursuant to\n\n                    \n\n1.  Entitled  the \"Solicitation  by Law  Enforcement Officers\nAct,\" the statute provides that:\n     A  person may not solicit property from the general\n     public  when the  property  or  any  part  of  that\n     property in any way tangibly benefits, is  intended\n     to tangibly benefit or is represented to be for the\n     tangible  benefit of  any law  enforcement officer,\n     law   enforcement   agency   or   law   enforcement\n     association.\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 25,   3702-A (1992).\n\n2.  Plaintiffs include the Auburn Police Union, the  Portland\nPolice Benevolent Association, and  the Lewiston Police Union\n     all  of  which  come within  the  definition  of a  \"law\nenforcement  association\" as defined  in Me. Rev.  Stat. Ann.\ntit.  25,    3701(2); Leonard  Dexter,  Kevin MacDonald,  and\nDavid  B. Chamberlain     all  of  whom are  officers of  law\nenforcement  associations;   R.H.  McKnight   Co.,  Inc.,   a\ncorporation  in the business of fundraising and promotions on\nbehalf   of   law   enforcement   officers,   agencies,   and\nassociations through sale  of advertising and  publication of\ntrade   magazines,  programs   and  handbooks;   and  Charles\nUnderwood,  a  private  citizen who  wishes  to  advertise in\npolice  publications   and   to  receive   copies  of   those\npublications.\n\n                             -3-\n\n42 U.S.C.    1983, seeking to enjoin  the Act and to  have it\n\ndeclared unconstitutional  under  the  First  and  Fourteenth\n\nAmendments to the United States Constitution.  \n\n          While declaring  that the provision  for injunctive\n\nenforcement was  an  unconstitutional  prior  restraint,  the\n\ndistrict court otherwise upheld  the Act against  plaintiffs'\n\noverbreadth  and equal protection challenges.  Both the State\n\nof  Maine and  plaintiffs  appeal.   We  vacate the  district\n\ncourt's determination  that the  injunctive relief  provision\n\namounts to an  impermissible prior restraint, and  affirm the\n\ndistrict court's  upholding of the  constitutionality of  the\n\nAct.\n\n                              I.\n\n          As the Act was originally enacted in 1977, its sole\n\nexception was  for  solicitations  by or  on  behalf  of  law\n\nenforcement  officers  campaigning  for  election  to  public\n\noffice     an exception still in  existence.   Me. Rev. Stat.\n\nAnn. tit. 25,   3703.  In 1983, the Act was  amended to allow\n\ngame wardens to sell historical publications describing state\n\nparks.3  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 25,   3702.\n\n                    \n\n3.  After  the  1983  amendment,  section  3702 provided  the\nfollowing:\n          No  person  may   solicit  property  from  the\n     general  public when the  property, or any  part of\n     it, in any way benefits, is intended to  benefit or\n     is represented  to be  for the benefit  of any  law\n     enforcement officer, law enforcement  agency or law\n     enforcement  association,  except  that  any  state\n     warden service  association may offer for  sale, by\n\n                             -4-\n\n          In 1983, Maine's Attorney General brought an action\n\nunder the  Unfair Trade  Practices Act,  Me. Rev.  Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 5,     205-A  to 214, against  the Maine  State Troopers\n\nAssociation (\"M.S.T.A.\")    a law enforcement association  as\n\ndefined  in Me.  Rev. Stat.  Ann. tit.  25,    3701(2)     to\n\nenjoin  the   M.S.T.A.  from  engaging  in  solicitations  in\n\nviolation of    3702.  The Attorney General  alleged that the\n\nM.S.T.A. had sold and offered to sell advertisements to Maine\n\nbusinesses  for insertion in  its magazine, \"The  Maine State\n\nTrooper.\"        The    M.S.T.A.   challenged    the    Act's\n\n                    \n\n     persons  other  than  wardens  or  members  of  the\n     association, to  members of the  public guide books\n     or  handbooks  containing   historical  reviews  or\n     descriptions  of  services,  except  that  on   the\n     request of a nonmember the  association may provide\n     that person with  the copies requested for  sale by\n     that  person.   No advertisements  may  be sold  or\n     included in these publications, except greetings or\n     complimentary  statements  from members  or  former\n     members  which  shall  give the  full  name  of the\n     member  or former member.   A stated  rate for this\n     advertisement space shall be published and no funds\n     in excess  of that stated  rate may be  accepted by\n     the association for space.\n          A record of  receipts and sales for  space and\n     sales  of   the  publication  shall   be  kept  and\n     available  to  the  public  during  normal  working\n     hours.\n          All  proceeds   from  these  sales   shall  be\n     expended for direct  charitable services to members\n     or  their  spouses, widows,  children,  widowers or\n     parents  and may  not  be  used  for  buildings  or\n     equipment,   construction    or   maintenance    or\n     entertainment of members.\n          Any violation of this chapter shall constitute\n     a  violation of  Title 5,  chapter  10, the  unfair\n     trade practices laws.\nMe.

It  found irrelevant\n\nthe subjective intent of the solicitor and the absence of any\n\ncomplaint of  coercion:   \". . . at least  the appearance  of\n\ncoercion  inheres  in  every solicitation  on  behalf  of law\n\nenforcement,\" undermining \"the integrity of the office.\"  Id.\n                                                             \n\nat  542-43.   The  Law  Court noted  the  Maine Legislature's\n\nfinding that \"[s]olicitation  by a law enforcement  agency is\n\ninherently coercive.\"  Id.   In the court's view, the State's\n                          \n\ninterest \"in protecting the reputation of its law enforcement\n\nbodies is undeniably substantial.   Indeed, we would be  hard\n\npressed to suggest  a weightier interest.\"  Id.   Holding the\n                                               \n\nstatute   not  to  be  \"fatally  overbroad,\"  the  Law  Court\n\nemphasized that \"the integrity of the State's law enforcement\n\nagents  is cast  in doubt  with every  solicitation on  their\n\nbehalf.\"  Id.  Thus the court found the Act constitutional.  \n             \n\n          The Law Court, however,  affirmed the lower court's\n\ndecision  that under  the  Equal  Protection  Clause  of  the\n\nFourteenth  Amendment, the State could not impose any greater\n\nrestrictions  on the  solicitation  activities of  other  law\n\n                             -6-\n\nenforcement officers  than were  imposed upon  state wardens.\n\nId. at 544.4   The Maine State  Troopers Association appealed\n   \n\nfrom the  Law Court's  decision to the  Supreme Court  of the\n\nUnited  States, which summarily dismissed the appeal for want\n\nof a substantial federal question.

Me. Rev. Stat. tit. 25,    3706.  The Legislature\n\nadditionally  amended the Act  to permit solicitations  for a\n\nperiod of one year, later  extended an additional six months,\n\nto raise  funds for the  construction of a memorial  to slain\n\npolice  officers.

The\n                  \n\ndistrict court affirmed the magistrate judge, who ruled in  a\n\ncomprehensive  opinion  that   the  Supreme  Court's  summary\n\n                    \n\n4.  The  Law Court affirmed  the lower court's  judgment that\nthe M.S.T.A. should  be permitted to sell  their publications\nto  the  general  public, subject  to  the  same restrictions\nimposed on  associations of state  wardens by Me.

Id.  at 616.5   The court  held that the  Act was\n               \n\nunconstitutionally overbroad  and invalid on its face because\n\n\"[a]  complete  prohibition  on police  solicitation  is  not\n\nnarrowly  tailored to  Maine's  evident  interest in  banning\n\nsome,  but not  all, such solicitation.\"   Id.  at 618.   The\n                                              \n\ncourt  further  concluded  that the  Act  violated  the Equal\n\nProtection  Clause of  the  Fourteenth Amendment  because the\n\nState  could  not  demonstrate   a  substantial  governmental\n\ninterest  in permitting police solicitation for a memorial to\n\nslain  officers, while  prohibiting  police solicitation  for\n\nother  causes.   Id. at  619.   Finally,  the district  court\n                    \n\ndetermined that the  Act constituted  an impermissible  prior\n\nrestraint because  it \"silences by fiat an entire category of\n\ncharitable solicitation.\"   Id. at  618.  The State  of Maine\n                               \n\ndid not appeal in that case.\n\n          Instead, in  1991, the  Maine Legislature  repealed\n\nthe exemptions, except for the exemption for solicitations by\n\n                    \n\n5.

For  example, if  police\n     officers  engage  in  solicitations  of  money  for\n     earthquake  victims in South America, and if no law\n     enforcement   agency,   officer,   or   association\n     receives, is intended to receive, or is represented\n     to receive any of the proceeds of the solicitation,\n     then that  solicitation program  will not  tangibly\n                                              \n     benefit law enforcement.\n\n                             -10-\n\n          Plaintiffs  brought the  present suit  on September\n\n27, 1991,  seeking a  declaratory judgment  that    3702-A is\n\nboth  facially   unconstitutional  and   unconstitutional  as\n\napplied.    Preliminary  and  permanent  injunctions  against\n\nenforcement of    3702-A were requested.   Several plaintiffs\n\nalleged  that they  wanted to  solicit  advertising from  the\n\nbusiness  community  and  to place  those  advertisements  in\n\npolice magazines like the \"Maine State Trooper,\" and that the\n\nAct  prohibited this  conduct.   According  to plaintiffs,   \n\n3702-A  violates the First  and Fourteenth Amendments because\n\nit   is   unconstitutionally   overbroad,   serves   as    an\n\nimpermissible prior restraint on their freedom of speech, and\n\ndenies to them the equal protection of the laws.\n\n          The  district court  held  that  the provision  for\n\nenforcement of the  Act through injunctive relief  created an\n\nimpermissible  prior  restraint.   Otherwise,  it  upheld the\n\nconstitutionality of    3702-A.

Maine  also appeals  from  the  district court's\n\ndeclaration that the  injunctive relief provision constitutes\n\nan impermissible prior restraint. \n\n                             II.\n\n          This appeal presents difficult  questions.  We must\n\ndecide,  first, what  issues are  foreclosed  by the  Supreme\n\nCourt's  dismissal  for want  of  a federal  question  of the\n\nappeal  in MSTA.   And,  if any  of the First  and Fourteenth\n               \n\nAmendment issues raised  by appellants are not  foreclosed by\n\nMSTA, we must decide them.\n    \n\n          In  the enabling  Act, the  Maine  Legislature said\n\nthat the Act: \n\n          clarifies and reaffirms  that the primary\n          and  compelling  purpose  underlying  the\n          laws   governing   solicitation   by  law\n          enforcement officers is  to eliminate the\n          coercion    that    is     inherent    in\n          solicitations  by and  on  behalf of  law\n          enforcement officers by  prohibiting such\n          solicitations.   When  a law  enforcement\n          officer  solicits   from  a   prospective\n          donor,  the  donor may  not  feel totally\n          free to  reject the  request in light  of\n          the officer's position . . . .\n\nPriv. &amp;  Spec. Laws 1991,  Ch. 510   5.   We set  forth in an\n\nappendix the full text of this section of the enabling Act.\n\n          In challenging  the Act, appellants contend it goes\n\nfar beyond what is constitutionally permissible and necessary\n\nto   address  whatever   valid  concerns   exist  about   the\n\n                             -12-\n\ncoerciveness of police solicitations.  Appellants insist that\n\nsuch dangers,  if any, must  be regulated more  narrowly, for\n\nexample, by legislation prohibiting  solicitation by officers\n\nin uniform,  or requiring that  solicitation be done  only by\n\npersons who are not themselves police officers.   The present\n\ntotal  ban on solicitation by  any \"person\" when the property\n\nor any  part of it \"in any way tangibly benefits, is intended\n\nto tangibly benefit or is  represented to be for the tangible\n\nbenefit  of  any  law  enforcement  officer  . . . agency  or\n\n. . . association,\" is  said to be  unconstitutionally broad,\n\nforeclosing  innocent  actions  and  speech  that  could  not\n\npossibly cause any of the evils the Maine Legislature  fears.\n\nFor   example,  the  Act  would  bar  placing  an  unattended\n\ncollection box for  a police charity in a  public place, even\n\nthough doing this could not, appellants say, exert a coercive\n\ninfluence.   Appellants say that  the Act does not  adopt, as\n\nthe  First Amendment requires, the least restrictive means to\n\naddress  the evil  of police  coercion;  that it  is a  prior\n\nrestraint, not  only  because  of  the  conferred  injunctive\n\npowers but because of its overall scheme; and that it offends\n\nother constitutional principles.\n\n          These  issues are not easy given the protection our\n\nConstitution  affords speech  and speech-related  activities.\n\nNonetheless, we conclude that the Maine  Legislature's effort\n\nto deal with the dangers of police solicitation is within its\n\n                             -13-\n\nconstitutional authority.   We hold that the  Supreme Court's\n\ndismissal of  the MSTA appeal  is binding on  the overbreadth\n                      \n\nissue, and that  appellants' remaining constitutional  claims\n\nare insufficient.\n\n          A.

Instead,  we   should  examine   the\n\njurisdictional  statement filed in  the Supreme Court  of the\n\nUnited States and  any other relevant aid to  construction in\n\norder   to  ascertain   what   issues  were   \"presented  and\n\nnecessarily decided\" by the Court's summary dismissal.12 \n\n          Examining   the   MSTA   jurisdictional  statement,\n                                \n\ntogether  with the accompanying papers filed with the Supreme\n\nCourt and the opinions of  the lower courts, we conclude that\n\nappellants in MSTA specifically presented the issue of facial\n                  \n\noverbreadth,  including  whether  the  Act  was broader  than\n\njustified  by the underlying  state interest, to  the Supreme\n\nCourt.

Unlike  the\ncourt in  Auburn I,  however, we also  conclude that  MSTA is\n                                                          \nentitled  to binding  precedential  value  on  the  issue  of\nsubstantial overbreadth.\n\n                             -19-\n\nto have rejected this issue  as a predicate to its dismissing\n\nof the  appeal for  want of  a substantial  federal question.\n\nThe issue of so-called underinclusiveness, however,  does not\n\nso clearly appear in the papers, and later changes in the Act\n\nfurther  erode the  present  bearing of  MSTA on  that topic.\n                                             \n\nTherefore, the  dismissal in  MSTA is binding  upon us  as to\n                                  \n\noverbreadth, but is not binding as to underinclusiveness, nor\n\nbinding as to certain \"as applied\" issues the plaintiffs have\n\nraised.

For example,  without themselves necessarily\n\n                             -20-\n\nwishing  to engage in such conduct, they note that solicitors\n\nmay wish  to put out  unattended collection boxes  to receive\n\npolice  donations.   This, they  say,  would be  noncoercive,\n\nsince  no one would know  who donated or  did not donate, yet\n\nthe  Act would prohibit it.   Similarly, plaintiffs point out\n\nthat  hypothetical  private  citizens,  unconnected with  the\n\npolice, are prevented by the Act from soliciting donations to\n\nlaw   enforcement  from   friends       for  instance,   from\n\nvoluntarily soliciting funds to buy a new cruiser for a local\n\ndepartment.   This, too, is said to be  an example of how the\n\nAct  sweeps too  broadly,  prohibiting protected  conduct  by\n\nthird parties.13  \n\n          Classic  overbreadth,  however,   was  an  argument\n\nspecifically  presented  to  the Supreme  Court  in  the MSTA\n                                                             \n\nappeal  and necessarily  rejected by  its  dismissal of  that\n\nappeal for want of a substantial federal question.\n\n                    \n\n13.  One can  also hypothesize, for  purposes of  overbreadth\nanalysis, other arguably unconstitutional applications of the\nAct.   For  example, the  Act might  be construed  to prevent\nprivate citizens  from asking for  money to lobby for  a bill\nthat  raises police  salaries.   However,  because the  Act's\nprohibition runs only against fundraising for  the \"tangible\"\nbenefit  of  law  enforcement, the  Maine  courts  might well\nreject  any such  interpretation.  Speculative readings  like\nthis would seem best decided,  if ever sought to be enforced,\nin an  \"as-applied\"  lawsuit,  rather  than  hypothesized  in\nadvance  for purposes of facial overbreadth analysis.  In any\ncase, as  discussed infra,  we consider  the issue of  facial\n                         \noverbreadth to be  foreclosed by the Supreme  Court's summary\ndismissal of the MSTA appeal.  \n                     \n\n                             -21-\n\n          When so  dismissing, the  Supreme Court  had before\n\nit,  both in M.S.T.A.'s  jurisdictional statement and  in its\n\nnotice  of appeal, appellants'  explicit contention  that the\n\nAct  was overbroad.   And,  as noted  supra, the  Law Court's\n                                           \n\nunderlying  opinion from  which appeal  was  being taken  had\n\nspecifically discussed and rejected  overbreadth as a  ground\n\nfor invalidating the Act.\n\n          It is true  that in first describing  the questions\n\npresented on appeal,  M.S.T.A.'s jurisdictional statement    \n\nafter  setting  out the  terms  of  the  Act     defined  the\n\nquestion only as  whether or not the Act  \"violates the First\n\nand Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\"\n\nLater,  however, under  the heading  of  \"Stated Reasons  for\n\nPlenary  Consideration,\" the  jurisdictional statement  urged\n\nupon the Court the desirability of its being able to question\n\ncounsel as  to  \"the overbreadth  doctrine.\"   In a  footnote\n\nappended to that suggestion, M.S.T.A. stated,\n\n          \"From the outset,  appellant has asserted\n          the  overbreadth  doctrine  of  NAACP  v.\n                                               \n          Button, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106514\"><a href=\"/opinion/106514/naacp-v-button/\"><span class=\"volume\">371</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">415</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (1963).\"  \n                \n\nIn NAACP, the Court had stated, among other comments relevant\n        \n\nto  overbreadth,  \"Furthermore,  the instant  decree  may  be\n\ninvalid  if  it  prohibits   privileged  exercises  of  First\n\nAmendment rights whether or not the record disclosed that the\n\npetitioner has engaged in privileged conduct.\"  Id. at 432.  \n                                                   \n\n                             -22-\n\n          That overbreadth was specifically presented to, and\n\nrejected by, the  Supreme Court is underscored  by M.S.T.A.'s\n\nstatement in its  notice of appeal to the  Supreme Court that\n\nappeal was taken from the portion of the Law Court's decision\n\nthat \"the  statute in question  is not overbroad.\"   We find,\n\ntherefore, that in denying the MSTA appeal, the Supreme Court\n                                   \n\nwas  expressly  presented  with,   and  must  therefore  have\n\nrejected,  the argument  that  the  Act was  unconstitutional\n\nunder the First Amendment because of overbreadth.  \n\n          We  think  the  Court's  rejection  of  overbreadth\n\nsubsumed, besides the \"classic\" overbreadth described  above,\n\nanother common variety of facial overbreadth claim.

As later sections of this opinion demonstrate, we do not\nregard the  Court's denial of  appeal in MSTA as  barring our\n                                             \nconsideration  of  claims  attacking the  sufficiency  of the\nState's  compelling  interest   based  on  underinclusiveness\n(equal protection) grounds.\n\n                             -24-\n\nlaw enforcement officers\" and as \"an intangible harm\" allowed\n\nin  the Law Court  to \"deprive law  enforcement associations,\n\nand others, of  protected First Amendment rights.\"   M.S.T.A.\n\nurged summary  reversal because  the \"Law  Court, absent  any\n\nevidence  of actual or perceived coercion, apparently assumed\n\nthe  compelling state  interest  into  existence  based  upon\n\ncomments  in the legislative  history of the  Act.\"  M.S.T.A.\n\nurged the  Supreme Court     if unwilling to reverse  the Law\n\nCourt summarily    to question counsel as to \"the broad sweep\n\nof the State's alleged compelling interest, together with the\n\nappellant's assertion of the 'overbreadth doctrine.'\"   These\n\nstatements  were prefaced  by mention  of  the trial  court's\n\nfinding  that appellants  had  not engaged  \"in  any form  of\n\ncoercion or otherwise used their official position to solicit\n\nadvertising,\"  a comment supportive of other remarks that the\n\nLaw Court had  rested the State's compelling  interest solely\n\non  a need  to conserve  the \"image\"  of its  law enforcement\n\nofficers.\n\n          We think  the above statements  necessarily alerted\n\nthe Supreme  Court to a  claim of \"overbreadth\" based  on the\n\nnotion that the Act's burdens on speech went beyond any truly\n\ncompelling state interest.\n\n          The  challenged  language  of  the present  Act  is\n\nvirtually identical in  all material respects to  the statute\n\nfound to  be  constitutional in  MSTA.   The  key  difference\n                                     \n\n                             -25-\n\nbetween the current  version of the Act, Me.  Rev. Stat. Ann.\n\ntit. 25,   3702-A, and the prior version of the Act, Me. Rev.\n\nStat. Ann. tit. 25,    3702, is that the current version  now\n\nprovides that  the prohibition on  solicitation applies  only\n\nwhen  solicitation \"tangibly\"  benefits  any law  enforcement\n\nofficer, agency or  association.  This clarifies  that police\n\nsolicitation   for  charitable   causes   unrelated  to   law\n\nenforcement is not barred.   Arguably, under the old  statute\n\nsuch solicitation was barred because  it intangibly benefited\n\nlaw  enforcement  by  providing good  will.    Even assuming,\n\nhowever, that the  addition of the word  \"tangible\" to modify\n\n\"benefits\" in the present version worked a substantive change\n\nin  the law,  that change  only narrowed  the breadth  of the\n\nAct's prohibition.   Because    3702-A is even  narrower than\n\nthe  former   3702, the  Supreme Court's summary dismissal of\n\nMSTA, in  which the  Supreme Court  necessarily rejected  the\n    \n\noverbreadth  and  compelling  interest  challenges  described\n\nabove, is binding precedent on whether    3702-A is overbroad\n\nin  the senses  just discussed.

According  to  plaintiffs, the  Legislature's\n\nformer enactment of  these now-defunct exceptions permanently\n\nundermined  the Act's  compelling  interest.16   We disagree.\n\nWe know of  no precedent for invalidating a  statute based on\n\nrepealed exceptions:   the Maine legislature, having restored\n\nthe statute something close to its original form, is entitled\n\nto the same respect afforded to its original judgment.\n\n          While we reject plaintiffs' assertion that repealed\n\nexceptions to the Act prevent  Maine from ever again having a\n\ncompelling interest in prohibiting solicitation beneficial to\n\nlaw enforcement, we  take more seriously  plaintiffs' further\n\ncontention  that extant exceptions  to the Act  undermine the\n                       \n\nState's assertion of a compelling state interest.  Plaintiffs\n\nidentify   three  such  exceptions,  said  to  make  the  Act\n\nunconstitutionally  underinclusive:    (1)  The  Act  permits\n\n                    \n\n16.  As  the  magistrate  judge  wrote  in   his  Recommended\nDecision:  \"the proverbial egg cannot be unscrambled.\"  \n\n                             -28-\n\nsolicitations  that  intangibly  benefit  the  police,  e.g.,\n\nsolicitations  by police officers  for a public  charity; (2)\n\nthe  Act permits solicitations  that benefit  state officials\n\nother than law enforcement officers;  and (3) The Act permits\n\nsolicitations   on  behalf   of   law  enforcement   officers\n\ncampaigning for public office.  While the latter distinctions\n\nwere present  in the statute upheld in MSTA, the issue of the\n                                           \n\nAct's  alleged  underinclusiveness  and  its  effect  on  the\n\ncompelling  state interest supporting the Act were not raised\n\nin either the Maine courts or in the jurisdictional statement\n\nto  the Supreme  Court.17   Because  the issue  of the  Act's\n\npurported underinclusiveness was not presented to the Supreme\n\nCourt in MSTA, the Supreme  Court's summary dismissal of that\n             \n\ncase is  not binding precedent  on this issue.

The police  occupy a\n\nunique role.   They are empowered to enforce  a wide array of\n\ncriminal laws  and to protect  the property and lives  of the\n\ngeneral citizenry.  To do this they are armed, given enhanced\n\narrest powers, and  given access to information  networks and\n\nother tools denied to most citizens.  Police necessarily have\n\nconsiderable on-the-spot authority of a discretionary sort   \n\nwhether  to give  or withhold  a traffic  ticket, to  make an\n\narrest, or to  notice or disregard a violation.   While even-\n\nhanded  treatment is the  ideal, officers may,  and sometimes\n\ndo, enforce  laws in  a less than  neutral manner.   For this\n\nreason, citizens and local businesses will try to stay on the\n\ngood side of  police, fearing    whether or  not correctly   \n\nthat   a  miffed  police  officer  and  his  associates  will\n\nretaliate, or will turn their backs when most needed.  Hence,\n\n                             -36-\n\nthe Maine  Legislature could reasonably conclude  that police\n\nsolicitation has a special potential for coercion not present\n\nin solicitation by other officials.  \n\n          Plaintiffs'  third example  of the  Act's purported\n\nunderinclusiveness     the  exception  for  solicitations  on\n\nbehalf  of law enforcement officers running for public office\n\n    is  also  unavailing.

We,\n                           \n\ntherefore,  agree  with  the district  court  that  the First\n\nAmendment  right of  law enforcement  officers  to engage  in\n\ncampaign speech provides a substantial  justification for the\n\nAct's  exemption of  such  speech  from  its  prohibition  on\n\n                             -37-\n\nsolicitation.21    See   Austin,  494  U.S.  at   668  (media\n                               \n\nexemption from  prohibition  on  corporations  using  general\n\ntreasury funds to support state candidate  elections \"ensures\n\nthat the  Act does  not hinder  or prevent  the institutional\n\npress from  reporting on,  and  publishing editorials  about,\n\nnewsworthy events\").\n\n          As  the State can  furnish \"clear reasons\"  for the\n\nasserted  exemptions from  the  Act's  prohibitions, and  the\n\nreasons are  not only  clear but rational,  we hold  that the\n\nMaine Act is not unconstitutionally underinclusive.\n\n          D.

McKnight Co.,\n\na professional  fundraiser and  publisher of  law enforcement\n\n                    \n\n21.  To   the  extent  that  coercion  is  caused  by  police\nsolicitations  for   campaign  fundraising,  the   State  has\nattempted  to minimize it by imposing certain restrictions on\nsuch solicitations.   For example, Me.  Rev. Stat. Ann.  tit.\n25,      3711  prohibits  solicitations  by  law  enforcement\nofficers while  in uniform.   Section 3712 prohibits  any law\nenforcement officer  running for a nonpartisan  public office\nfrom  soliciting on his own behalf.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit.\n25,   3712.   Section 3713 prohibits  the use of  coercion in\nsolicitations.  Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 25,   3713.  Section\n3714 makes a violation of these restrictions a Class E crime.\nMe.  Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 25,    3714.  Other restrictions on\nlaw enforcement  officers  running for  elective  office  are\ncontained  in  statute,  union  contracts  and   departmental\nregulations.   See  Me.  Rev.  Stat. Ann.  tit.  30-A,    355\n                  \n(Pamph. 1991) (regulating political  activity of sheriffs and\ndeputy sheriffs).   Together, these restrictions serve  as an\neffective accommodation of  the First Amendment right  of the\npolice  to  engage  in  political  speech  with  the  State's\ninterest  in   preventing   coercion   inherent   in   police\nsolicitation.\n\n                             -38-\n\nmagazines; plaintiff Charles Underwood, a private citizen who\n\nwishes  to advertise in  such magazines;22 and  the plaintiff\n\nlaw  enforcement association which  wishes to disseminate the\n\nmagazines.23     Plaintiffs   contend   that  the   sale   of\n\nadvertising in law  enforcement publications like  the \"Maine\n\nState  Trooper\"  is  a noncoercive  undertaking.   Plaintiffs\n\npoint specifically to the allegedly noncoercive nature of the\n\nsystem  of solicitation  designed by  R.H.  McKnight Co.,  in\n\nwhich telephone solicitors supposedly make it clear that they\n\nare not police  officers, and the names of persons who do not\n\npurchase  advertisements are  not  directly released  to  the\n\nsponsoring law enforcement organization.24\n\n                    \n\n22.  We  note that  plaintiff  Underwood  can  raise  no  \"as\napplied\"  challenge with regard to his  right to advertise in\nthe  police magazines, as  the statute does  not prohibit him\nfrom  advertising but from being  solicited to advertise.  As\n                                           \nsuch, his  claim is  rightly considered  along with  those of\nplaintiff R.H. McKnight Co. and the plaintiff law enforcement\nassociation.\n\n23.  It  is debatable  whether plaintiffs  can  bring an  as-\napplied  challenge  in  the  context  of  a   pre-enforcement\ndeclaratory  judgment action.  See United States v.

The Legislature  could\n\nreasonably  doubt   that  the   solicitations  would   become\n\nnoncoercive  merely  because the  names of  those who  do not\n\npurchase  advertisements were promised not to be disclosed to\n\nthe police.  The advertisements will be public.  Accordingly,\n\nlaw enforcement  officers will  be aware  of who  contributed\n\nand,  by  the  absence  of advertisements,  of  who  did  not\n\ncontribute.   Moreover, those solicited may not believe, even\n\nif  they  are   assured,  that  their   names  will  not   be\n\ncommunicated.

We   are  not  persuaded   that  plaintiffs'\n\nalternatives would necessarily answer that concern.\n\n          Because plaintiffs'  proposed solicitations  remain\n\ninherently coercive, or at least do not remove the appearance\n\nof  coercion and  favoritism, we reject  plaintiffs' argument\n\nthat the Act is unconstitutional as applied.\n\n          E. Prior Restraint\n                            \n\n          Any   violation  of   the   Act's  prohibition   on\n\nsolicitation  that  tangibly  benefits   law  enforcement  is\n\nconsidered  a violation of  the Maine Unfair  Trade Practices\n\nAct.  Me.  Rev. Stat. tit. 25,   3702-A.  The Act, therefore,\n\ncan  be enforced either through civil penalties or injunctive\n\nrelief.     Finding  that  enforcement  of  the  Act  through\n\ninjunctive  relief would  constitute  an impermissible  prior\n\nrestraint, the district court  declared the injunctive relief\n\nprovision  of the Act  to be  unconstitutional.25   While the\n\n                    \n\n25.  Plaintiffs actually argued to the district court, and to\nthis  court,  that  the  Act's  categorical   prohibition  on\nsolicitation,   in    and   of    itself,   constitutes    an\nunconstitutional prior  restraint.  According  to plaintiffs,\nthe Act constitutes a prior restraint because it \"silences by\nfiat  an entire category of charitable solicitation.\"  Auburn\n                                                             \nI, 756 F.

Plaintiffs further  contend\n                               \nthat  barring   solicitation  of  funds  is   a  particularly\neffective  prior restraint  because law  enforcement agencies\nwill not have the financial resources to spread their message\nto the general public.\n     The  district   court  correctly   rejected  plaintiffs'\narguments  that the  entire Act  should be  invalidated  as a\nprior restraint.    Under plaintiffs'  analysis,  almost  any\nregulation  of speech would  be considered a  prior restraint\n\n                             -42-\n\ndistrict   court's  concern   that  injunctions   are  rarely\n\ntolerated in the  First Amendment context is  understandable,\n\nwe think the court acted improperly in invalidating the Act's\n\ninjunctive relief provision on its face.\n\n          A prior restraint  is a government  regulation that\n\nlimits or  conditions in  advance the  exercise of  protected\n\nFirst Amendment activity.

Legislative intent.  It is  the intent of\n          Sec. 5.   Legislative intent.\n\nthe Legislature to  repeal all exceptions to  the prohibition\n\nagainst solicitation  by law  enforcement agencies,  officers\n\nand associations.   The  Legislature finds  that the  various\n\nexceptions  to the  prohibition enacted  over  the years,  in\n\nfact,  have led to inherently coercive solicitations and that\n\nthose  exceptions ultimately undermine  the integrity  of law\n\nenforcement.  As a consequence, the Legislature repeals these\n\nexceptions and reenacts  the prohibition on  solicitations by\n\nor  on behalf  of law enforcement.   The  Legislature further\n\nfinds that solicitations for charitable purposes unrelated to\n\nlaw  enforcement  activities  are  not  inherently   coercive\n\nbecause the person  solicited will know that  law enforcement\n\nagencies  or officers do  not gain any  tangible benefit and,\n\nconsequently will  not be concerned  with who donates.   This\n\nAct clarifies and  reaffirms that the primary  and compelling\n\npurpose  underlying the  laws governing  solicitation  by law\n\nenforcement officers  is to  eliminate the  coercion that  is\n\ninherent in solicitations by and on behalf of law enforcement\n\n                             -47-\n\nofficers  by  prohibiting  such solicitations.    When  a law\n\nenforcement officer solicits  from a  prospective donor,  the\n\ndonor  may not  feel totally  free to  reject the  request in\n\nlight of the  officer's position.  This  occurs regardless of\n\nthe   subjective  intent  of   the  officer  to   coerce  the\n\nprospective  donor.    In  addition  to  the  effect  on  the\n\nprospective donor, the  appearance of the transaction  to 3rd\n\npersons may undermine  public confidence in the  integrity of\n\nthe  public  office.   At  least the  appearance  of coercion\n\ninheres in  every  solicitation that  tangibly  benefits  law\n\nenforcement  agents   and  the   appearance  undermines   the\n\nintegrity of  the office.    The Legislature  finds that  the\n\nState has a  compelling interest in preserving  the integrity\n\nof law enforcement officers and finds that regulating all law\n\nenforcement   solicitations   that   tangibly   benefit   law\n\nenforcement  is  necessary to  promote this  compelling state\n\ninterest.\n\n[Priv. &amp; Spec.
