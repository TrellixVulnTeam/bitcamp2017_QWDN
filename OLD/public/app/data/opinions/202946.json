Petitioners Minya Zeru and her\n\nhusband, Russom Ghebrai, both natives and citizens of Eritrea,\n\napplied for asylum on the basis of past persecution and a fear of\n\nfuture persecution.    The petitioners premised their application on\n\ngovernment   harassment   of   Zeru   due   to   her   membership   in   an\n\norganization that advocated Eritrean independence when that country\n\nbelonged to Ethiopia; the organization now opposes the incumbent\n\nEritrean government.    Following hearings conducted over the course\n\nof almost five years, an Immigration Judge (IJ) found petitioners'\n\ntestimony to be not credible, that they had not established past\n\npersecution, and that, in any event, there was no basis for a claim\n\nof future persecution.    The IJ thus denied the asylum application.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed in a per curiam\n\norder.\n\n          Zeru and Ghebrai moved to reopen by challenging the\n\ncredibility determination and alleging ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel during the asylum appeal to the BIA.           The BIA denied the\n\nmotion.\n\n          Zeru and Ghebrai petition for review of both the denial\n\nof asylum and the denial of the motion to reopen.         The petition is\n\nsupported by an amicus brief on behalf of various groups concerned\n\nwith the rights of refugees and torture victims.        We affirm both of\n\nthe BIA orders and deny the petitions for review.\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f                                   I.\n\nA.           Denial of Claims for Relief\n\n             Zeru arrived in the United States on December 20, 1994.\n\nHer non-immigrant business visa allowed her to remain in the United\n\nStates until July 20, 1995.    In October 1995, she filed for asylum\n\nand for withholding of removal and was interviewed by an asylum\n\nofficer. Zeru's case was transferred to the Immigration Court. In\n\nFebruary 1998, both Zeru and Ghebrai, who had overstayed his visa\n\nas   well,    received   Notices   to    Appear   charging   them   with\n\nremovability.     Zeru and Ghebrai conceded removability, but both\n\nsought asylum, withholding of removal, voluntary departure, and\n\nrelief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) based on Zeru's\n\nassertions of political persecution.\n\n             An IJ heard testimony from Zeru and Ghebrai on five\n\noccasions between January 20, 1999, and March 21, 2002.1       In those\n\ninitial hearings before the original IJ, Zeru testified to the\n\nfollowing facts.     She was born in 1968 in Massawa, then a part of\n\nEthiopia.     From the age of fifteen, Zeru began pamphleteering and\n\nengaging in fundraising activities on behalf of the Eritrean\n\nLiberation Front-Revolutionary Council (ELF-RC), a political group\n\ndevoted to Eritrean independence and the establishment of a multi-\n\n\n\n     1\n          The IJ continued the first hearing, in which he heard\ntestimony from Zeru, due to concerns about the quality of the\ninterpreter.   Zeru began her testimony anew, with a different\ninterpreter, at the next hearing on August 27, 1999.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fparty democratic system of government.            Zeru kept her political\n\nactivities secret from her family, fearing retribution from various\n\npolitical opponents. One rival separatist group in particular, the\n\nEritrean Peoples' Liberation Front (EPLF), opposed the ELF-RC's\n\nagenda in favor of single-party rule.\n\n            Zeru testified that she was arrested in 1987 by Ethiopian\n\nsoldiers acting on a tip from the EPLF, and endured a six-month\n\nperiod of imprisonment ending on January 27, 1988.               She testified\n\nthat she was raped, and that she was beaten numerous times by her\n\njailors.     Following     her   release,     Zeru     spent    six    months   in\n\noutpatient treatment for depression in Ethiopia.\n\n            Within a year of her release from imprisonment, Zeru\n\nresumed fundraising for the ELF-RC.            By that time, she had met\n\nGhebrai, a physician who worked in a state-run hospital.                    Zeru\n\ntestified   that   she    did   not   tell   Ghebrai    about    her   political\n\nactivities or her prior imprisonment.          Zeru and Ghebrai testified\n\nthat they were married in January 1990.\n\n            The EPLF defeated the Ethiopian military in 1991 and took\n\npower in Eritrea.        Zeru testified that Eritrean security forces\n\n(according to Zeru, effectively the same organization as the former\n\nEPLF) began harassing her in 1993, following a failed coup attempt.\n\nOn two occasions, security officers detained Zeru and interrogated\n\nher in security forces offices near her import business in Asmara.\n\nThen, in September 1994, Eritrean officers detained Zeru for a ten-\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fhour interrogation.     According to testimony that Zeru gave in\n\nAugust 1999, one of her interrogators held a gun to her head and\n\nthreatened to kill her.     Zeru testified that she had \"never felt\n\nworse\" than during that encounter.\n\n           After the September 1994 incident, Zeru sought the advice\n\nof a friend who worked as a secretary with the Eritrean security\n\nforces.    In November, the friend warned her that her name had\n\nappeared on a list of ELF-RC members, and that she was in grave\n\ndanger.    Leaving the country, her friend said, was her \"only\n\noption.\"   At that point, Zeru told Ghebrai about her political\n\nactivities and her history of harassment by government officials.\n\nZeru testified that she obtained a visa and passport through her\n\nsecretary friend and left Eritrea.     This was more than six years\n\nafter her 1987-88 imprisonment. Zeru arrived in Boston in December\n\n1994 and resided with a cousin in Portland, Maine.    She was eight\n\nmonths pregnant with her second child at the time.\n\n           Zeru testified that she did not contact her family after\n\nleaving Eritrea, and that she had not been in communication with\n\nthem until recently.   Nor did Zeru have any contact with Ghebrai,\n\nbut communicated with him in occasional messages conveyed through\n\na relative.   Ghebrai entered the United States in March of 1996, on\n\na short-term visa to study medicine in Los Angeles, but initially\n\nhad no contact with Zeru.   Ghebrai did not join Zeru in Maine until\n\ncompleting six months of medical training.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f            A new IJ was assigned to petitioners' case in 2003.         He\n\nreviewed the record, including petitioners' previous testimony, and\n\nheld a full day of hearings on November 26, 2003.         Zeru and Ghebrai\n\nreiterated their prior testimony.           Zeru stated during direct\n\nevidence that she had been raped once, at the start of her\n\nimprisonment in 1987.      Later, following cross examination and in\n\nresponse to questioning by the IJ, Zeru said there were two\n\ninstances of rape, the second just before her release.\n\n            Petitioners also presented an affidavit and testimony\n\nfrom a fact witness named Efrem Weldemichael.             Weldemichael, a\n\nnative of Eritrea and a United States citizen, testified that he\n\nwas an ELF-RC executive committee member in the United States.\n\nWeldemichael testified that he knew Zeru as an ELF-RC member when\n\nthey were both in Ethiopia during the mid-1980s; he also testified\n\nthat he heard reports from other ELF-RC members in 1987 or 1988\n\nthat Zeru was imprisoned by the Ethiopian government.\n\n            The IJ also heard from Dr. Melissa Wattenberg, a clinical\n\npsychologist specializing in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),\n\nwhom petitioners presented as an expert witness.           Wattenberg was\n\nnot   a   treating   psychologist   and   did   not   provide   therapeutic\n\nservices to Zeru.      Rather, at the request of Zeru's counsel, she\n\ninterviewed Zeru about her experiences during two meetings in\n\nOctober and November of 1998, almost four years after Zeru entered\n\nthe country, and produced a detailed Assessment Report dated\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fDecember 1999. That report summarized Zeru's oral statement of her\n\nown history and concluded that \"Ms. Zeru meets criterion for\n\ncurrent moderate PTSD, and moderate depression.\"                    The report also\n\nopined that Zeru \"is a sincere and reliable reporter of her own\n\nexperience.\"      Zeru told Wattenberg that she had been raped three\n\ntimes, which differed from her hearing testimony.\n\n            Zeru's attorney sought to use Wattenberg's testimony to\n\nestablish   the    contents     of     her    report    and    to    assess   Zeru's\n\ncredibility.       The   IJ   admitted       the    report    into    evidence   and\n\nindicated that he need not hear testimony duplicative of the\n\nreport's contents.       Zeru's counsel stated that she had no other\n\nquestions for Wattenberg, and rested on the contents of the report.\n\n            The IJ also reviewed petitioners' documentary evidence\n\nduring the November 26, 2003, hearing. The hearing opened with the\n\nIJ pointing out that Ghebrai failed to bring his original passport,\n\nincluding the relevant visa page, to the hearing.                       Petitioners\n\npresented the IJ with a letter they had written to the hospital in\n\nEritrea where Zeru had allegedly received treatment following her\n\n1987-88 incarceration, but they were unable to produce the hospital\n\nrecords requested in the letter.               Zeru also produced an ELF-RC\n\nidentification      card      issued     at        Zeru's     request    from    the\n\norganization's office in Bonn, Germany, in 1998.                     Zeru testified\n\nthat she did not carry such a card in Eritrea, but that she\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fobtained it because she \"was asked to produce this to prove my\n\nmembership.\"\n\n            Zeru    also   entered   into     evidence    an   official        letter\n\nsignifying her release from the prison where she was held in\n\nEthiopia. Zeru testified that she possessed the letter since 1995.\n\nZeru's attorney explained that the document could not be verified\n\nby the United States Embassy in Addis Ababa because petitioners had\n\nsent a copy instead of the original document to the embassy.\n\n            Finally,       petitioners        submitted        their         marriage\n\ncertificate.       They sent the certificate for verification to the\n\nUnited States Embassy in Asmara, but the embassy responded that\n\nZeru's date of birth as listed on the certificate conflicted with\n\nthe date recorded in Asmara municipal records.                       In addition,\n\ncertain information on the certificate, including the bride's date\n\nof birth and the date of the marriage contract, had been covered\n\nwith white-out and typed over.                The IJ admitted all of the\n\ndocuments into evidence, noting that he would \"give them what\n\nweight I deem is appropriate.\"\n\n            On     December   29,    2003,     the   IJ   denied       the    asylum\n\napplication and ordered petitioners' removal.                  The IJ based his\n\ndecision on adverse credibility findings for Zeru and Ghebrai, a\n\nlack   of   corroborating     evidence       requested    by   IJs     during     the\n\nproceedings, and the submission of apparently fraudulent documents.\n\nWe describe some, but not all, of the IJ's findings.                   The IJ gave\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fa number of reasons for his credibility determinations.                 Among\n\nthem, he pointed out that Zeru claimed on different occasions to\n\nhave been raped once, twice, or three times.           The IJ noted that\n\neven if he was willing to ignore the contradiction in Zeru's\n\ntestimony between whether she was raped once or twice during her\n\nsix-month detention, he was still concerned that Zeru had told\n\nWattenberg   that   she   was   raped     three    times.    It   was    the\n\ninconsistency between her testimony to the IJ and her report to\n\nWattenberg that the IJ found material and relevant.         The IJ stated\n\nthat \"it would not be unusual for a victim of trauma to confuse\n\ndates or sequences of events, but it would be very unusual . . . to\n\nsimply forget that an event occurred.\"            The IJ recited numerous\n\nother inconsistencies in petitioners' testimony relating to their\n\nbackgrounds, their marriage, their experiences in Eritrea, and\n\ntheir work histories.\n\n          The IJ noted that Zeru had been asked to produce specific\n\ndocuments to corroborate her claim and failed to do so.                   For\n\nexample, the IJ noted that she had testified that her uncle was\n\narrested in 1993 for involvement in a coup attempt and that the\n\narrest was very well publicized.        She was directed at a hearing on\n\nAugust 27, 1999, to obtain news reports or other information to\n\nsubstantiate the arrest.    Yet at the hearing on November 26, 2003,\n\nshe neither produced the documents nor had an explanation for her\n\nfailure to do so.\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f          In    addition,     the   documents    petitioners        did   submit\n\ncontained inconsistencies and evident alterations detracting from\n\npetitioners' claims.     The IJ recounted the bases for his findings\n\nthat the prison release letter,2 the marriage certificate3 and other\n\ndocumentary evidence offered by petitioners were fraudulent.\n\n          The IJ further observed that petitioners' demeanor during\n\nthe November 26, 2003, hearing belied their believability.                The IJ\n\nnot only found Ghebrai to be wholly incredible, but also that he\n\nhad given fraudulent testimony under oath.              Indeed, the IJ found\n\nthat he doubted the testimony of both petitioners even as to their\n\nidentities and whether they were husband and wife.\n\n          The IJ also made an adverse credibility finding as to\n\nWeldemichael.      The   IJ    pointed     out   that    in   his    affidavit,\n\nWeldemichael stated that he first met Zeru in Ethiopia in 1983 and\n\nsaw her \"a couple of time[s]\" in that context.                At the hearing,\n\nhowever, Weldemichael insisted that he first met Zeru in 1986, and\n\nonly met her once in Ethiopia.           The IJ also found it incredible\n\n\n     2\n          For example, the IJ found it telling that though Zeru\nsaid she had the letter in her possession since as early as 1995,\nshe did not present it to the asylum officer at her interview. He\nfound the document most likely had been recently fabricated to\nsupport her testimony.\n     3\n          The IJ suspected that the certificate was fraudulent\nbecause of the unexplained presence of white-out on the document,\nthe discrepancy regarding Zeru's purported date of birth between\nthe certificate and Asmara municipal records, and the fact that the\nUnited States Embassy could not determine whether the certificate\nwas genuine.    The IJ also pointed out that petitioners could\nprovide no other documentary evidence of their marriage.\n\n                                    -10-\n\fthat although Weldemichael purported to be an ELF-RC leader in\n\nEthiopia, and although he had heard reports of Zeru's imprisonment\n\ndue to her ELF-RC affiliation, Weldemichael never took enough\n\ninterest in Zeru's plight to investigate Zeru's condition in prison\n\nor whether she was released before the two met again in the United\n\nStates in 1994.      The IJ also observed Weldemichael's demeanor and\n\nstated that he \"simply cannot find that Mr. W[e]ldemichael was\n\ncredible.\"\n\n              Because petitioners' testimony was not credible, and\n\nbecause their corroborating evidence was not only insufficient to\n\nsupport their claims, but in fact contradicted them, the IJ found\n\nthat   Zeru    and   Ghebrai   had    failed   to   establish   either   past\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution following their\n\nreturn   to    Eritrea.    See    8   C.F.R.   §    1208.13(a)-(b)   (asylum\n\napplicants bear burden of proof to establish refugee status); see\n\nalso Singh v. Gonzales, 413 F.3d 156, 159 (1st Cir. 2005) (citing\n\nDiab v. Ashcroft, 397 F.3d 35, 39 (1st Cir. 2005)) (stating that\n\ncorroborating evidence may bolster the testimony of a less than\n\nentirely credible alien).        In concluding that petitioners had not\n\nestablished past persecution, the IJ found that petitioners had\n\nshown neither that they suffered any harm nor that they had\n\nestablished a nexus to one of the five statutory grounds for\n\nestablishing refugee status. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.13(b)(1).      The IJ also separately rejected the claims that\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fpetitioners would suffer persecution on their return or had a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution.           See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(2).\n\nThe IJ noted that petitioners' close relatives continued to live\n\npeacefully in Eritrea. Indeed, Zeru's brother was in the military,\n\nand her family continued to live in the same home and run the\n\nfamily business, unmolested by the Eritrean government.                  The IJ\n\nalso denied petitioners' applications for withholding of removal,\n\nprotection under the CAT, and voluntary departure.4\n\n            Zeru and Ghebrai retained a new attorney, Solomon Bekele,\n\nfor their appeal to the BIA.         On appeal, petitioners insisted they\n\nhad established past persecution.            They claimed that the IJ erred\n\nin   his    credibility    finding       because   he    improperly     demanded\n\nauthenticated documentary evidence to prove petitioners' claims.\n\nThey also objected to the IJ's use of demeanor in finding Zeru and\n\nGhebrai incredible.\n\n            Petitioners    described       inconsistencies        regarding    the\n\nnumber of Zeru's rapes as \"minor\" and explained them as lapses in\n\nmemory due to the passage of time.            Petitioners also claimed that\n\nthe second IJ did not observe proper procedures applicable upon\n\nassigning    a   new   judge   to   an    immigration     case.      Petitioners\n\nadditionally     argued   that      because    Zeru     had   established     past\n\n\n     4\n          Petitioners' brief does not advance any arguments\nregarding their claims for withholding of removal, protection under\nthe CAT, or voluntary departure. Those claims accordingly have\nbeen waived for purposes of this petition. See Dine v. Gonzales,\n464 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                      -12-\n\fpersecution, petitioners were entitled to a finding of well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution and a grant of their withholding of\n\nremoval claim.     Finally, petitioners made a perfunctory argument\n\nthat they qualified for protection under the CAT.\n\n            On February 7, 2006, the BIA affirmed, incorporating an\n\nearlier August 3, 2005 per curiam order. The BIA upheld both the\n\nlack   of    credibility       finding     and     the    finding    that   the\n\ninconsistencies were not sufficiently explained.               The BIA noted\n\nthat   it   did   not   find    persuasive       Zeru's   argument   that   the\n\ninconsistencies were caused by lapses of memory.               Further, that\n\nargument    did   not   explain    inconsistencies        in   Ghebrai's    and\n\nWeldemichael's testimony. The BIA also noted that the IJ allowably\n\nconsidered the demeanor of the witnesses.\n\n            The BIA also found a lack of corroborating evidence. The\n\nBIA noted that Zeru's immediate family members continued to reside\n\nin Eritrea without harm.           As to the argument that this was\n\nexplained by the fact that her family members were politically\n\ninactive, the BIA noted that was inconsistent with her husband's\n\ntestimony that he was not politically active, but nonetheless he\n\nhad been threatened repeatedly by security agents. In turn, it was\n\nimplausible that the husband, had he been threatened by government\n\nagents, would have been granted a passport and permitted to travel\n\nto the United States.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f            The BIA also addressed petitioners' argument regarding\n\nthe assignment of a new IJ to their case.       The BIA's decision made\n\nclear that the IJ complied with the requirement that he familiarize\n\nhimself with the record and so state on the record.        In fact, the\n\nIJ's opinion made repeated reference to details of petitioners'\n\ntestimony given in hearings presided over by the previous IJ.\n\nB.          Motion to Reopen\n\n            Zeru and Ghebrai, represented by new counsel, filed a\n\nmotion to reopen on May 5, 2006.        The motion was based on alleged\n\nnew information about Zeru's PTSD and on alleged ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel stemming from Bekele's representation during\n\nthe initial appeal.\n\n            Zeru and Ghebrai offered evidence tending to show that\n\nZeru's PTSD had worsened.      Zeru's evidence was that she suffered a\n\nbreakdown upon learning of her imminent deportation to Eritrea and\n\nwas hospitalized on November 12, 2005, for depression and suicidal\n\nthoughts.     Zeru submitted a letter from Dr. John Mirczak, a\n\npsychiatrist who treated her after her release from the hospital,\n\ndated February 1, 2006, and stating that Zeru suffered severe PTSD\n\nas a result of        \"multiple gang rapes . . . suffered while a\n\npolitical prisoner in Eritrea.\"         The letter further stated that\n\nZeru's symptoms would worsen if she were to return to Eritrea.\n\nPetitioners    also    submitted    a     \"supplementary   psychological\n\nassessment\" from Dr. Mirczak dated April 27, 2006.          Dr. Mirczak\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fwrote that \"what can sometimes happen with trauma patients is that\n\nthey may dissociate\" and that their memories \"may be repressed.\"\n\nThe    supplemental     assessment     does     not    explicitly      ascribe    such\n\nsymptoms to Zeru.\n\n             The    motion     also   relied    on     three   other    letters       to\n\npetitioners' attorneys from mental health professionals regarding\n\nZeru's PTSD diagnosis.           The first, from a staff member at the\n\nPsychiatric Institute of Washington named Dianne Carlson, explained\n\nthat Zeru had flashbacks to her imprisonment and rapes, and that\n\nZeru used dissociation and denial to avoid re-experiencing past\n\ntraumas.      The     second    letter    contained      the   impressions       of    a\n\npsychologist, Jane McGoldrick, who met with Zeru twice in April\n\n2006.    McGoldrick wrote that Zeru referred in her meetings to her\n\nrape and torture, but that she was \"too tearful and distressed to\n\nreport details\" of those episodes. McGoldrick asserted that Zeru's\n\nrecovery was contingent upon the success of her asylum claim.\n\n             Finally, the motion to reopen presented a lengthy letter\n\nfrom    F.   Barton    Evans,     a   forensic        psychologist     retained       by\n\npetitioners' counsel to review the Wattenberg report and provide a\n\n\"literature        review\"   regarding     PTSD.         The   letter     aimed       at\n\ncontradicting the IJ's statement that \"it would not be unusual for\n\na victim of trauma to confuse dates or sequences of events, but it\n\nwould be very unusual for a victim of trauma to simply forget that\n\nan event occurred.\" The IJ was referring to the difference between\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fZeru's testimony and what she told Wattenberg about the number of\n\ndifferent occasions on which she had been raped.                     Evans wrote that\n\nWattenberg's affidavit negated the IJ's statement because of its\n\nreference to Zeru \"recall[ing] feeling dissociated from her body\n\nduring these rapes\" and \"utiliz[ing] avoidant strategies.\"                       Evans\n\ncited several psychological studies for the proposition that PTSD\n\nvictims may suffer inconsistent recall of traumatic events.                       Evans\n\nwrote that \"from the perspective of the psychology of trauma, the\n\npresence of dissociative symptoms in fact adds believability to\n\n[Zeru's] report.\" Petitioners' motion to reopen explained that all\n\nof    the   foregoing         letters    \"challenged      the   credibility     finding\n\nstemming from Zeru's differing statements regarding the number of\n\ntimes she was raped.\"\n\n                 Zeru   and    Ghebrai    claimed       ineffective     assistance   of\n\ncounsel      because     \"Bekele's       work     was    egregiously    deficient    in\n\npreparation of\" the asylum appeal.                      This was so because Bekele\n\nfailed      to    address      adequately    in    his    brief   the    IJ's   adverse\n\ncredibility findings in general, and in particular \"the most\n\nimportant ground of appeal, namely the virtual elimination of the\n\ntestimony of [Wattenberg,] who was in the best position to address\n\n. . . Zeru's credibility.\"                  Petitioners argued that Bekele's\n\nfailures amounted to a due process violation. The motion to reopen\n\ndid   not    address      the    IJ's    decisions       regarding    withholding    of\n\nremoval, the CAT, or voluntary departure.\n\n\n                                            -16-\n\f           The BIA denied the motion to reopen on August 22, 2006,\n\nin a four-page, closely reasoned order discussing, inter alia, the\n\nspecifics of the new medical evidence.       The BIA noted the limited\n\nnature of the new evidence.       Mirczak's letter opined that Zeru's\n\nmemory \"could have been [a]ffected by dissociation, but overall she\n\nis being factual about the brutality that happened.\"          McGoldrick,\n\nwho said the disorder Zeru was suffering \"often has as symptoms\"\n\nmemory problems and amnesia for aspects of traumatic experiences,\n\ndid not say that Zeru suffered those symptoms.          The BIA stressed\n\nthat Evans did not even conduct a direct examination of Zeru.\n\n           The   BIA   met   head-on   Evans's   criticism   of   the   IJ's\n\nstatement that \"it would not be unusual for a victim of trauma to\n\nconfuse dates of sequences of events, but it would be very unusual\n\nfor a victim of trauma to simply forget that an event occurred.\"\n\nEven accepting Evans's criticism, the BIA held that it would not\n\nlikely have changed the outcome of the proceeding, for several\n\nreasons.    Zeru's inconsistent statements about the number of\n\noccasions on which she was raped were not the sole basis for the\n\nlack of credibility finding, which rested on numerous independent\n\ninconsistencies as well as upon the IJ's assessment of Zeru's\n\ndemeanor. Also, Zeru had failed to provide corroborating evidence.\n\nThe entire body of medical evidence rested on the credibility of\n\nher reports to the doctor, but the IJ had, based on substantial\n\nevidence, found her not to be credible in her reporting of her\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fhistory. Further, the basic PTSD diagnosis evidence was before the\n\nBIA in the prior appeal and had been considered.\n\n              As to the ineffective assistance claim, the BIA reasoned\n\nthat it also failed because even considering the new evidence and\n\nnew emphasis on the effects of trauma on memory (the argument prior\n\ncounsel, it was argued, should have made), the respondent still had\n\nnot demonstrated that the outcome might have differed.\n\n              Zeru and Ghebrai timely petitioned to this court for\n\nreview of the BIA's rejection of their asylum appeal and the\n\nBoard's denial of the motion to reopen.\n\n                                      II.\n\n              Petitioners urge this court that \"the Petition for Review\n\nof the Motion [to Reopen] should . . . be held to be the functional\n\nequivalent of the direct appeal\" such that the two petitions would\n\nbe reviewed under the same standard and with reference to the\n\nentire administrative record.            Based on this misunderstanding,\n\npetitioners conflate their arguments challenging the denial of\n\nasylum and the denial of the motion to reopen.\n\n              The two petitions are legally distinct.           See Keo Chan v.\n\nGonzales, 413 F.3d 161, 165 n.3 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[T]he legal\n\nseparateness of the denial of the asylum claim and the motion to\n\nreopen   is    demonstrated   by   the   fact     that   each   is   a   separate\n\nappealable order.\"); see also 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(A) (\"[T]he\n\ncourt    of    appeals   shall     decide   the     petition     only    on   the\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fadministrative record on which the order of removal is based.\")\n\n(emphasis added).       We review them separately according to their\n\nrespective records and standards of review.               See, e.g., Zeng v.\n\nGonzales, 436 F.3d 26, 29, 32 (1st Cir. 2006); Olujoke v. Gonzales,\n\n411 F.3d 16, 21, 23 (1st Cir. 2005); Fesseha v. Ashcroft, 333 F.3d\n\n13, 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nA.            Denial of Asylum\n\n              Petitioners challenge the denial of asylum by attacking\n\nthe IJ's credibility findings.           Petitioners assert that the IJ did\n\nnot give sufficient weight to evidence provided by Wattenberg, who\n\n\"would have been able to address the impact of PTSD on Ms. Zeru's\n\nmemory and ability to recollect certain events related to her\n\ntrauma.\"      This is dispositive, petitioners argue, because they\n\ncharacterize the IJ's credibility finding as turning on Zeru's\n\ninconsistent testimony as to the number of times she was raped\n\nafter her imprisonment in 1987.             Petitioners also argue that the\n\ncredibility      finding,     to   the    extent   it   was    based   on     other\n\ninconsistent testimony or deficiencies in corroborating evidence,\n\nwas   based    on   trivial   or   immaterial      evidence.     We    hold    that\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the IJ's findings and deny the\n\npetition for review.\n\n              We must affirm an IJ's findings of fact, including the\n\ncredibility of witnesses, if they are \"supported by reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fwhole.\"    INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992) (quoting\n\n8 U.S.C. § 1105a(a)(4)) (internal quotation marks omitted).                           An\n\nIJ's credibility determinations demand deference where (1) the\n\ndiscrepancies and omissions described by the IJ are actually\n\npresent in the record; (2) those discrepancies and omissions\n\nprovide     specific     and     cogent     reasons      to     conclude      that   the\n\npetitioners provided incredible testimony regarding facts central\n\nto the merits of the asylum claim; and (3) petitioners do not\n\nprovide    a   convincing       explanation        for    the     discrepancies      and\n\nomissions.     Zheng v. Gonzales, 464 F.3d 60, 63 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(citing Hoxha v. Gonzales, 446 F.3d 210, 214 (1st Cir. 2006)).\n\n            The IJ based his findings of incredibility on, inter\n\nalia,    numerous     inconsistencies        in    Zeru's       testimony.       First,\n\nalthough Zeru told Wattenberg that she had been gang raped three\n\ntimes during her imprisonment from 1987-88, she testified to the IJ\n\nthat she had been raped once, and then later, that she had been\n\nraped twice.         Second, Zeru testified in August 1999 that in\n\nSeptember 1994, Eritrean security officers interrogated her for ten\n\nhours, at one point pointing a gun at her and threatening to kill\n\nher.    She testified that the encounter terrified her.                      In November\n\n2003,     however,     Zeru    described         the    episode    as    a    four-hour\n\nquestioning,    and     stated    that     she    did    not    take    the   officers'\n\nwarnings seriously.            Third, Zeru told Wattenberg that she met\n\nGhebrai when working at a pharmacy owned by her father.                               In\n\n\n                                          -20-\n\fcontrast, Zeru testified to the IJ that they met at the government\n\nhospital where Ghebrai worked and where Zeru did volunteer work.\n\nFourth, Zeru testified in 2000 that she completed twelfth grade,\n\nwhile in 2003 she testified that she attended school until the\n\ntenth grade.     Fifth, Zeru gave inconsistent testimony as to how\n\nlong she owned her own business in Asmara and what products her\n\nstore sold.\n\n           As to Ghebrai's testimony, the IJ noted inconsistencies\n\nas to when he learned of Zeru's participation in the ELF-RC, as\n\nwell as conflicting testimony regarding the location of Ghebrai's\n\nalleged encounters with Eritrean security forces searching for Zeru\n\nafter her departure to the United States.           The IJ also stressed\n\nthat Ghebrai's demeanor during his November 2003 testimony \"was one\n\nof a person who completely lacked v[e]racity.\"\n\n           Morever, the IJ cited discrepancies and omissions in the\n\npetitioners' corroborating documentary evidence that bolstered his\n\ndetermination of incredibility.        The document that Zeru offered as\n\nproof of her 1987-88 imprisonment could not be authenticated when\n\nshe sent a copy to the United States Embassy in Ethiopia.              There\n\nwere reasons to doubt another important document.              Petitioners'\n\nmarriage   certificate    revealed     an    inconsistency     with   Asmara\n\nmunicipal records regarding Zeru's date of birth, and the whited-\n\nout   document   displayed   signs    of    tampering.   The    documentary\n\nproblems continued:      Zeru testified that hospital records were\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\favailable in Eritrea to corroborate her outpatient treatment for\n\ndepression in 1988.    In spite of being advised by an IJ to obtain\n\nthose documents, and in spite of the fact that her family lives in\n\nproximity to the hospital in Eritrea, Zeru was able neither to\n\nproduce the hospital records nor to explain why she did not produce\n\nthem.   Nor was Zeru able to produce business records or the\n\nmandatory annual government permits for the business in Asmara that\n\nshe testified at various times to having operated for either one\n\nyear or for three and a half years.       Petitioners were not even able\n\nto produce, at an IJ's request, income tax filings, employment-\n\nrelated documents, or any other documents that could corroborate\n\nthat they were indeed married.\n\n          Petitioners      concede,       appropriately,       that   these\n\ndiscrepancies    are   \"specific    and    cogent\"   to    a    finding   of\n\nincredibility, and that some of them \"do go to the heart of the\n\nasylum claim.\"   Petitioners seem to suggest, however, that had the\n\nIJ given due weight to Wattenberg's testimony, her diagnosis of\n\nPTSD would have adequately explained the discrepancies in Zeru's\n\ntestimony regarding traumatic events, especially variations in the\n\nnumber of alleged rapes.\n\n          During their direct appeal to the BIA, petitioners did\n\nnot challenge the credibility determination on grounds that the\n\ninconsistencies resulted from PTSD. Instead, petitioners attempted\n\nat that stage to explain away testimonial inconsistencies as \"the\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fresult of memory laps[e]\" due to the passage of time between events\n\nin Eritrea and the asylum hearings.      Issues not raised before the\n\nBIA generally may not be raised for the first time on a petition\n\nfor review.      Bernal-Vallejo v. INS, 195 F.3d 56, 64 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n            Even construing petitioners' arguments in front of the\n\nBIA as encompassing the PTSD theory, however, we cannot conclude\n\nthat \"any reasonable adjudicator\" would be compelled to disagree\n\nwith the IJ's credibility determination. 8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).\n\nWattenberg's     Assessment   Report    was    based        on   Zeru's   oral\n\nrepresentations    to   Wattenberg,    which   the     IJ    concluded    were\n\nuntrustworthy.\n\n            Even so, the IJ did not ignore the report or Wattenberg's\n\ndiagnosis of Zeru as suffering from PTSD.               The IJ expressly\n\nacknowledged that \"it would not be unusual for a victim of trauma\n\nto confuse dates or sequences of events.\"            The IJ expressed his\n\ndoubt that such an effect would be sufficient to explain Zeru's\n\ndisparate statement to Wattenberg and her testimony as to the\n\nnumber of times she was raped.     No evidence was ever submitted by\n\npetitioners to contradict that specific doubt. Indeed, no specific\n\nevidence was submitted to the BIA on this point until the motion to\n\nreopen, when Evans addressed it in his letter, and he had not even\n\nmet Zeru.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\f              Further,    even       assuming       arguendo      the   accuracy     of\n\nWattenberg's diagnosis of PTSD, petitioners do not claim that PTSD\n\nclouded Zeru's testimony regarding non-traumatic facts of life such\n\nas dates of birth, educational level, where she met her future\n\nspouse,   or    how    long    she   owned   her      own   business.         Nor   does\n\nWattenberg's report offer any explanation of the many gaps and\n\ncontradictions within petitioners' documentary evidence.                      Taken as\n\na    whole,    the    record   available       to    the    BIA   at    the   time   of\n\npetitioners' direct appeal provides substantial evidence in support\n\nof the IJ's credibility determination.\n\nB.            Denial of Motion to Reopen\n\n              Petitioners challenge the BIA's denial of the motion to\n\nreopen on two grounds.          They first assert a due process violation\n\nresulting from an alleged ineffective assistance of counsel during\n\nthe appeal of the asylum proceedings to the BIA.                    They also argue\n\nthat the BIA erred in discounting the newly presented evidence of\n\nZeru's PTSD in denying the motion to reopen.\n\n              Motions to reopen deportation proceedings are disfavored\n\ndue to the \"strong public interest in bringing litigation to a\n\nclose . . . promptly.\"           Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 20 (quoting INS v.\n\nAbudu, 485 U.S. 94, 107 (1988)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe normal deference granted agency decisions on motions to reopen\n\napplies with greater force in the immigration context because of\n\nthe implications for foreign relations.                Ven v. Ashcroft, 386 F.3d\n\n\n                                        -24-\n\f357, 360 (1st Cir. 2004) (citing Abudu, 485 U.S. at 110).                 We\n\nreview the BIA's denial of a motion to reopen for abuse of\n\ndiscretion, reversing the denial \"only if the BIA 'misread the law'\n\nor acted 'in an arbitrary or capricious fashion.'\"            Fesseha, 333\n\nF.3d at 20 (quoting Carter v. INS, 90 F.3d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1996)).\n\n            A motion to reopen proceedings before the BIA must state\n\n\"new facts that will be proven at a hearing to be held if the\n\nmotion is granted.\"    8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1).        The evidence sought\n\nto   be   offered   must   be    material    and   neither   available   nor\n\ndiscoverable at the former hearing. Id. Ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel claims, in certain circumstances, may satisfy these general\n\nrequirements.    Saakian v. INS, 252 F.3d 21, 25 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            While aliens in deportation proceedings do not enjoy a\n\nSixth Amendment right to counsel, they have due process rights in\n\ndeportation proceedings.        Id. at 24.   As an \"integral part\" of this\n\nprocedural due process, aliens in deportation proceedings have a\n\nstatutory right to be represented by counsel at their own expense.\n\nId. (quoting Batanic v. INS, 12 F.3d 662, 667 (7th Cir. 1993)); see\n\nalso 8 U.S.C. § 1362.       \"Ineffective assistance of counsel in a\n\ndeportation proceeding is a denial of due process only if the\n\nproceeding was so fundamentally unfair that the alien was prevented\n\nfrom reasonably presenting his case.\"         Lozada v. INS, 857 F.2d 10,\n\n13 (1st Cir. 1988) (quoting Ramirez-Durazo v. INS, 794 F.2d 491,\n\n499-500 (9th Cir. 1996)) (internal quotation marks omitted).             To\n\n\n                                     -25-\n\fsucceed on an ineffective assistance of counsel claim, petitioners\n\nmust show \"a reasonable probability of prejudice\" resulting from\n\ntheir former representation.         Saakian, 252 F.3d at 25.\n\n            The gravamen of petitioners' argument before the BIA and\n\nthis court is that their appeal of the denial of asylum was\n\nprejudiced by Bekele's failure to challenge adequately the IJ's\n\ncredibility determination.           Petitioners peg their arguments to\n\ncounsel's    failure   to    argue    that       Wattenberg's   PTSD      diagnosis\n\nexplained the inconsistencies and undercut the lack of credibility\n\nfinding.\n\n            Neither the IJ nor the BIA rested either solely or\n\nnecessarily on Zeru's inconsistent testimony concerning traumatic\n\npast events in denying petitioners asylum.                 The BIA noted in its\n\ndenial of the motion to reopen that it had reviewed Wattenberg's\n\nreport and testimony.        The Board, informed by that information,\n\nconcluded that although petitioners had challenged some of the IJ's\n\nbases for his credibility determination, the board \"[did] not find\n\nthat [petitioners] have demonstrated that all bases . . . were\n\nerroneous.\"      Therefore, even if Bekele's initial appeal were\n\ndeficient in some respects, petitioners have failed to demonstrate\n\nthat the result would have been any different given their present\n\narguments.     In    addition,     \"the    Board's        careful   attention    to\n\n[petitioners']      motion   to   reopen     .    .   .   negated   any    possible\n\n\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\fviolation\" of petitioners' Fifth Amendment rights.                 Lozada, 857\n\nF.2d at 14.\n\n           Petitioners raise another due process issue related to\n\nWattenberg's     testimony.    Petitioners     argue   the    IJ    improperly\n\nlimited Wattenberg's testimony and thereby \"deprived Ms. Zeru of\n\nthe opportunity to present fundamental evidence critical to her\n\ncase.\"   Petitioners misstate the record.5        During the November 26,\n\n2003 hearing, the IJ admitted Wattenberg's Assessment Report into\n\nevidence   and   allowed   petitioners'     attorney   an    opportunity     to\n\nexamine Wattenberg beyond the report.          Counsel declined to do so.\n\nFollowing the government's cross-examination of Wattenberg, the IJ\n\noffered petitioners' counsel an opportunity to conduct redirect\n\nquestioning; counsel again declined.           Petitioners do not claim\n\ntheir representation before the IJ was deficient.              Further, the\n\nrecord reveals that the IJ reviewed Wattenberg's report in detail.\n\nPetitioners received a full and fair opportunity to present their\n\nexpert testimony.     That the IJ considered Wattenberg's testimony\n\nand reasonably discounted its evidentiary weight does not offend\n\nthe Fifth Amendment.\n\n           Finally,    petitioners     claim    that   the   BIA     erred   in\n\ndiscounting the new evidence of Zeru's PTSD accompanying the motion\n\nto reopen.     The BIA considered that evidence but concluded that\n\n\n     5\n          Unfortunately,      Zeru   has mischaracterized the record\nthroughout her brief,         and    amici have relied upon those\nmischaracterizations.\n\n                                     -27-\n\f\"evidence of [Zeru's] need for psychiatric care in late 2005 is not\n\na   sufficient        basis    to    overturn     the    comprehensive,        adverse\n\ncredibility finding from December 2003.\"                      Indeed, petitioners'\n\n\"new\" evidence simply reiterates Wattenberg's previous diagnosis of\n\nPTSD.     The    petitioners'        brief   concedes         that    \"[a]ll   of   this\n\ninformation could have been provided by Dr. Wattenberg if she had\n\nbeen given a chance to testify fully\" at the asylum hearings.\n\nWattenberg      was    given    that    chance.         The    PTSD    diagnosis     was\n\nconsidered during the asylum proceedings and before the BIA.                          We\n\ncannot say the BIA erred in holding the additional evidence of\n\nZeru's PTSD did not present \"new facts\" justifying a motion to\n\nreopen.     8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); cf. Lemus v. Gonzales, 489 F.3d\n\n399, 401 (1st Cir. 2007).              The BIA did not act arbitrarily or\n\ncapriciously in denying petitioners' motion.\n\n            We acknowledge the assistance provided by the brief filed\n\nby amici.    Zeru and amici correctly argue that the IJ and the BIA,\n\nin assessing credibility of aliens who are victims of trauma and\n\nconsequently suffer from PTSD, should be mindful that serious\n\nmemory problems are a common symptom of PTSD.                        See Br. of Amici\n\nCuriae in Support of the Pet'rs 18-19.                  They also correctly argue\n\nthat expert medical evidence may assist the agency.                      Id. 27-28.\n\n            The record reveals that the BIA and IJ adhered to both\n\nprinciples in this case.            The IJ explicitly recognized that trauma\n\nvictims may give discrepant testimony. The IJ articulated his view\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\fthat   this    did    not    explain    the    discrepancies     between    Zeru's\n\ntestimony and her report to Wattenberg as to the number of rapes.\n\nZeru's evidence did not dispute this drawing of the line by the IJ.\n\nContrary to Zeru's claim that the BIA rejected the new evidence of\n\nZeru's medical condition in 2005, the BIA carefully considered that\n\nevidence, as described.\n\n              Amici also join Zeru in arguing that she was not given a\n\nfair chance to respond to doubts about her credibility.                    Not so.\n\nThere is no presumption that an alien seeking refugee status is\n\ncredible.      Nor is there an assumption that if the IJ has not made\n\nan express finding of non-credibility, the alien's testimony must\n\nbe taken as credible.         The burden of persuasion is Zeru's, 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.13(a), and that requires her to put forth sufficiently\n\ncredible testimony or other evidence to establish her eligibility\n\nfor asylum.\n\n              It was, or should have been, self-evident to Zeru and her\n\ncounsel      that    there    were    weaknesses      in   her   case   from   her\n\npresentation of evidence alone.            First, on the issue of the number\n\nof   times     she   had     been    raped,    she   was   inconsistent.       The\n\ninconsistency between her testimony to the IJ on that point and her\n\nstatements     to    Wattenberg      was   obvious.        Second,   Wattenberg's\n\naffidavit attempted to respond by saying that Zeru \"recall[ed]\n\nfeeling dissociated from her body\" during the rapes and adverted to\n\navoidance as a symptom of her PTSD.            Wattenberg was not barred from\n\n\n                                        -29-\n\fgiving further testimony on this point or from explaining the\n\ndiscrepancies.           Third, Zeru had the opportunity and means to\n\nprovide competent corroborative evidence. The documentary evidence\n\nshe presented appeared to be fraudulent. Fourth, during the course\n\nof the hearing, the IJ made it clear he had reason to doubt Zeru's\n\nclaims.       During one colloquy between Zeru and the IJ during the\n\nNovember 23, 2003, hearing, the IJ specifically pressed Zeru on\n\ninconsistencies between her testimony and facts contained in the\n\nWattenberg report.         For instance, the IJ asked Zeru multiple times\n\nwhether there were only two rapes during her imprisonment in\n\nEthiopia.       The IJ elicited Zeru's unequivocal denial that a third\n\nrape had occurred.          Thus Zeru herself contradicted what she told\n\nWattenberg.       The IJ also asked Zeru whether her father ever owned\n\na pharmacy, as stated in the Wattenberg report. Zeru answered that\n\nhe did not.      As for petitioners' suspect documentary evidence, the\n\nIJ indicated during the hearings that he had reason to believe they\n\nwere       fraudulent.     These   exchanges   put   petitioners   and   their\n\nattorney on notice of the IJ's misgivings, but petitioners never\n\noffered satisfactory explanations for any of these discrepancies.6\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          To the extent Zeru and amici argue that as a mechanical\nmatter the IJ must always, before the end of proceedings,\narticulate a belief that a petitioner is not credible and provide\nan additional opportunity to respond, we reject the argument.\nNeither the regulations nor procedural due process require such a\nprocedure. Indeed, it would be unusual.\n\n                                      -30-\n\f          There may be cases in which the failure by an IJ or the\n\nBIA to give due consideration to expert evidence regarding PTSD\n\njustifies dislodging a decision of the Board.     Cf. Mukamusoni v.\n\nAshcroft, 390 F.3d 110, 122-23 (1st Cir. 2004).     For the reasons\n\ndescribed, this is not such a case.\n\n          We affirm the decisions of the BIA.\n\n\n\n\n                              -31-\n\f",

Petitioners Minya Zeru and her\n\nhusband, Russom Ghebrai, both natives and citizens of Eritrea,\n\napplied for asylum on the basis of past persecution and a fear of\n\nfuture persecution.    The petitioners premised their application on\n\ngovernment   harassment   of   Zeru   due   to   her   membership   in   an\n\norganization that advocated Eritrean independence when that country\n\nbelonged to Ethiopia; the organization now opposes the incumbent\n\nEritrean government.    Following hearings conducted over the course\n\nof almost five years, an Immigration Judge (IJ) found petitioners'\n\ntestimony to be not credible, that they had not established past\n\npersecution, and that, in any event, there was no basis for a claim\n\nof future persecution.    The IJ thus denied the asylum application.\n\nThe Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) affirmed in a per curiam\n\norder.\n\n          Zeru and Ghebrai moved to reopen by challenging the\n\ncredibility determination and alleging ineffective assistance of\n\ncounsel during the asylum appeal to the BIA.           The BIA denied the\n\nmotion.\n\n          Zeru and Ghebrai petition for review of both the denial\n\nof asylum and the denial of the motion to reopen.         The petition is\n\nsupported by an amicus brief on behalf of various groups concerned\n\nwith the rights of refugees and torture victims.        We affirm both of\n\nthe BIA orders and deny the petitions for review.\n\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f                                   I.\n\nA.           Denial of Claims for Relief\n\n             Zeru arrived in the United States on December 20, 1994.\n\nHer non-immigrant business visa allowed her to remain in the United\n\nStates until July 20, 1995.    In October 1995, she filed for asylum\n\nand for withholding of removal and was interviewed by an asylum\n\nofficer. Zeru's case was transferred to the Immigration Court. In\n\nFebruary 1998, both Zeru and Ghebrai, who had overstayed his visa\n\nas   well,    received   Notices   to    Appear   charging   them   with\n\nremovability.     Zeru and Ghebrai conceded removability, but both\n\nsought asylum, withholding of removal, voluntary departure, and\n\nrelief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT) based on Zeru's\n\nassertions of political persecution.\n\n             An IJ heard testimony from Zeru and Ghebrai on five\n\noccasions between January 20, 1999, and March 21, 2002.1       In those\n\ninitial hearings before the original IJ, Zeru testified to the\n\nfollowing facts.     She was born in 1968 in Massawa, then a part of\n\nEthiopia.     From the age of fifteen, Zeru began pamphleteering and\n\nengaging in fundraising activities on behalf of the Eritrean\n\nLiberation Front-Revolutionary Council (ELF-RC), a political group\n\ndevoted to Eritrean independence and the establishment of a multi-\n\n\n\n     1\n          The IJ continued the first hearing, in which he heard\ntestimony from Zeru, due to concerns about the quality of the\ninterpreter.   Zeru began her testimony anew, with a different\ninterpreter, at the next hearing on August 27, 1999.\n\n                                   -3-\n\fparty democratic system of government.            Zeru kept her political\n\nactivities secret from her family, fearing retribution from various\n\npolitical opponents. One rival separatist group in particular, the\n\nEritrean Peoples' Liberation Front (EPLF), opposed the ELF-RC's\n\nagenda in favor of single-party rule.\n\n            Zeru testified that she was arrested in 1987 by Ethiopian\n\nsoldiers acting on a tip from the EPLF, and endured a six-month\n\nperiod of imprisonment ending on January 27, 1988.               She testified\n\nthat she was raped, and that she was beaten numerous times by her\n\njailors.     Following     her   release,     Zeru     spent    six    months   in\n\noutpatient treatment for depression in Ethiopia.\n\n            Within a year of her release from imprisonment, Zeru\n\nresumed fundraising for the ELF-RC.            By that time, she had met\n\nGhebrai, a physician who worked in a state-run hospital.                    Zeru\n\ntestified   that   she    did   not   tell   Ghebrai    about    her   political\n\nactivities or her prior imprisonment.          Zeru and Ghebrai testified\n\nthat they were married in January 1990.\n\n            The EPLF defeated the Ethiopian military in 1991 and took\n\npower in Eritrea.        Zeru testified that Eritrean security forces\n\n(according to Zeru, effectively the same organization as the former\n\nEPLF) began harassing her in 1993, following a failed coup attempt.\n\nOn two occasions, security officers detained Zeru and interrogated\n\nher in security forces offices near her import business in Asmara.\n\nThen, in September 1994, Eritrean officers detained Zeru for a ten-\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\fhour interrogation.     According to testimony that Zeru gave in\n\nAugust 1999, one of her interrogators held a gun to her head and\n\nthreatened to kill her.     Zeru testified that she had \"never felt\n\nworse\" than during that encounter.\n\n           After the September 1994 incident, Zeru sought the advice\n\nof a friend who worked as a secretary with the Eritrean security\n\nforces.    In November, the friend warned her that her name had\n\nappeared on a list of ELF-RC members, and that she was in grave\n\ndanger.    Leaving the country, her friend said, was her \"only\n\noption.\"   At that point, Zeru told Ghebrai about her political\n\nactivities and her history of harassment by government officials.\n\nZeru testified that she obtained a visa and passport through her\n\nsecretary friend and left Eritrea.     This was more than six years\n\nafter her 1987-88 imprisonment. Zeru arrived in Boston in December\n\n1994 and resided with a cousin in Portland, Maine.    She was eight\n\nmonths pregnant with her second child at the time.\n\n           Zeru testified that she did not contact her family after\n\nleaving Eritrea, and that she had not been in communication with\n\nthem until recently.   Nor did Zeru have any contact with Ghebrai,\n\nbut communicated with him in occasional messages conveyed through\n\na relative.   Ghebrai entered the United States in March of 1996, on\n\na short-term visa to study medicine in Los Angeles, but initially\n\nhad no contact with Zeru.   Ghebrai did not join Zeru in Maine until\n\ncompleting six months of medical training.\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f            A new IJ was assigned to petitioners' case in 2003.         He\n\nreviewed the record, including petitioners' previous testimony, and\n\nheld a full day of hearings on November 26, 2003.         Zeru and Ghebrai\n\nreiterated their prior testimony.           Zeru stated during direct\n\nevidence that she had been raped once, at the start of her\n\nimprisonment in 1987.      Later, following cross examination and in\n\nresponse to questioning by the IJ, Zeru said there were two\n\ninstances of rape, the second just before her release.\n\n            Petitioners also presented an affidavit and testimony\n\nfrom a fact witness named Efrem Weldemichael.             Weldemichael, a\n\nnative of Eritrea and a United States citizen, testified that he\n\nwas an ELF-RC executive committee member in the United States.\n\nWeldemichael testified that he knew Zeru as an ELF-RC member when\n\nthey were both in Ethiopia during the mid-1980s; he also testified\n\nthat he heard reports from other ELF-RC members in 1987 or 1988\n\nthat Zeru was imprisoned by the Ethiopian government.\n\n            The IJ also heard from Dr. Melissa Wattenberg, a clinical\n\npsychologist specializing in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD),\n\nwhom petitioners presented as an expert witness.           Wattenberg was\n\nnot   a   treating   psychologist   and   did   not   provide   therapeutic\n\nservices to Zeru.      Rather, at the request of Zeru's counsel, she\n\ninterviewed Zeru about her experiences during two meetings in\n\nOctober and November of 1998, almost four years after Zeru entered\n\nthe country, and produced a detailed Assessment Report dated\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fDecember 1999. That report summarized Zeru's oral statement of her\n\nown history and concluded that \"Ms. Zeru meets criterion for\n\ncurrent moderate PTSD, and moderate depression.\"                    The report also\n\nopined that Zeru \"is a sincere and reliable reporter of her own\n\nexperience.\"      Zeru told Wattenberg that she had been raped three\n\ntimes, which differed from her hearing testimony.\n\n            Zeru's attorney sought to use Wattenberg's testimony to\n\nestablish   the    contents     of     her    report    and    to    assess   Zeru's\n\ncredibility.       The   IJ   admitted       the    report    into    evidence   and\n\nindicated that he need not hear testimony duplicative of the\n\nreport's contents.       Zeru's counsel stated that she had no other\n\nquestions for Wattenberg, and rested on the contents of the report.\n\n            The IJ also reviewed petitioners' documentary evidence\n\nduring the November 26, 2003, hearing. The hearing opened with the\n\nIJ pointing out that Ghebrai failed to bring his original passport,\n\nincluding the relevant visa page, to the hearing.                       Petitioners\n\npresented the IJ with a letter they had written to the hospital in\n\nEritrea where Zeru had allegedly received treatment following her\n\n1987-88 incarceration, but they were unable to produce the hospital\n\nrecords requested in the letter.               Zeru also produced an ELF-RC\n\nidentification      card      issued     at        Zeru's     request    from    the\n\norganization's office in Bonn, Germany, in 1998.                     Zeru testified\n\nthat she did not carry such a card in Eritrea, but that she\n\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fobtained it because she \"was asked to produce this to prove my\n\nmembership.\"\n\n            Zeru    also   entered   into     evidence    an   official        letter\n\nsignifying her release from the prison where she was held in\n\nEthiopia. Zeru testified that she possessed the letter since 1995.\n\nZeru's attorney explained that the document could not be verified\n\nby the United States Embassy in Addis Ababa because petitioners had\n\nsent a copy instead of the original document to the embassy.\n\n            Finally,       petitioners        submitted        their         marriage\n\ncertificate.       They sent the certificate for verification to the\n\nUnited States Embassy in Asmara, but the embassy responded that\n\nZeru's date of birth as listed on the certificate conflicted with\n\nthe date recorded in Asmara municipal records.                       In addition,\n\ncertain information on the certificate, including the bride's date\n\nof birth and the date of the marriage contract, had been covered\n\nwith white-out and typed over.                The IJ admitted all of the\n\ndocuments into evidence, noting that he would \"give them what\n\nweight I deem is appropriate.\"\n\n            On     December   29,    2003,     the   IJ   denied       the    asylum\n\napplication and ordered petitioners' removal.                  The IJ based his\n\ndecision on adverse credibility findings for Zeru and Ghebrai, a\n\nlack   of   corroborating     evidence       requested    by   IJs     during     the\n\nproceedings, and the submission of apparently fraudulent documents.\n\nWe describe some, but not all, of the IJ's findings.                   The IJ gave\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fa number of reasons for his credibility determinations.                 Among\n\nthem, he pointed out that Zeru claimed on different occasions to\n\nhave been raped once, twice, or three times.           The IJ noted that\n\neven if he was willing to ignore the contradiction in Zeru's\n\ntestimony between whether she was raped once or twice during her\n\nsix-month detention, he was still concerned that Zeru had told\n\nWattenberg   that   she   was   raped     three    times.    It   was    the\n\ninconsistency between her testimony to the IJ and her report to\n\nWattenberg that the IJ found material and relevant.         The IJ stated\n\nthat \"it would not be unusual for a victim of trauma to confuse\n\ndates or sequences of events, but it would be very unusual . . . to\n\nsimply forget that an event occurred.\"            The IJ recited numerous\n\nother inconsistencies in petitioners' testimony relating to their\n\nbackgrounds, their marriage, their experiences in Eritrea, and\n\ntheir work histories.\n\n          The IJ noted that Zeru had been asked to produce specific\n\ndocuments to corroborate her claim and failed to do so.                   For\n\nexample, the IJ noted that she had testified that her uncle was\n\narrested in 1993 for involvement in a coup attempt and that the\n\narrest was very well publicized.        She was directed at a hearing on\n\nAugust 27, 1999, to obtain news reports or other information to\n\nsubstantiate the arrest.    Yet at the hearing on November 26, 2003,\n\nshe neither produced the documents nor had an explanation for her\n\nfailure to do so.\n\n\n                                  -9-\n\f          In    addition,     the   documents    petitioners        did   submit\n\ncontained inconsistencies and evident alterations detracting from\n\npetitioners' claims.     The IJ recounted the bases for his findings\n\nthat the prison release letter,2 the marriage certificate3 and other\n\ndocumentary evidence offered by petitioners were fraudulent.\n\n          The IJ further observed that petitioners' demeanor during\n\nthe November 26, 2003, hearing belied their believability.                The IJ\n\nnot only found Ghebrai to be wholly incredible, but also that he\n\nhad given fraudulent testimony under oath.              Indeed, the IJ found\n\nthat he doubted the testimony of both petitioners even as to their\n\nidentities and whether they were husband and wife.\n\n          The IJ also made an adverse credibility finding as to\n\nWeldemichael.      The   IJ    pointed     out   that    in   his    affidavit,\n\nWeldemichael stated that he first met Zeru in Ethiopia in 1983 and\n\nsaw her \"a couple of time[s]\" in that context.                At the hearing,\n\nhowever, Weldemichael insisted that he first met Zeru in 1986, and\n\nonly met her once in Ethiopia.           The IJ also found it incredible\n\n\n     2\n          For example, the IJ found it telling that though Zeru\nsaid she had the letter in her possession since as early as 1995,\nshe did not present it to the asylum officer at her interview. He\nfound the document most likely had been recently fabricated to\nsupport her testimony.\n     3\n          The IJ suspected that the certificate was fraudulent\nbecause of the unexplained presence of white-out on the document,\nthe discrepancy regarding Zeru's purported date of birth between\nthe certificate and Asmara municipal records, and the fact that the\nUnited States Embassy could not determine whether the certificate\nwas genuine.    The IJ also pointed out that petitioners could\nprovide no other documentary evidence of their marriage.\n\n                                    -10-\n\fthat although Weldemichael purported to be an ELF-RC leader in\n\nEthiopia, and although he had heard reports of Zeru's imprisonment\n\ndue to her ELF-RC affiliation, Weldemichael never took enough\n\ninterest in Zeru's plight to investigate Zeru's condition in prison\n\nor whether she was released before the two met again in the United\n\nStates in 1994.      The IJ also observed Weldemichael's demeanor and\n\nstated that he \"simply cannot find that Mr. W[e]ldemichael was\n\ncredible.\"\n\n              Because petitioners' testimony was not credible, and\n\nbecause their corroborating evidence was not only insufficient to\n\nsupport their claims, but in fact contradicted them, the IJ found\n\nthat   Zeru    and   Ghebrai   had    failed   to   establish   either   past\n\npersecution or a well-founded fear of persecution following their\n\nreturn   to    Eritrea.    See    8   C.F.R.   §    1208.13(a)-(b)   (asylum\n\napplicants bear burden of proof to establish refugee status); see\n\nalso Singh v.

In concluding that petitioners had not\n\nestablished past persecution, the IJ found that petitioners had\n\nshown neither that they suffered any harm nor that they had\n\nestablished a nexus to one of the five statutory grounds for\n\nestablishing refugee status. 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(B)(i); 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.13(b)(1).      The IJ also separately rejected the claims that\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fpetitioners would suffer persecution on their return or had a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution.           See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(2).\n\nThe IJ noted that petitioners' close relatives continued to live\n\npeacefully in Eritrea. Indeed, Zeru's brother was in the military,\n\nand her family continued to live in the same home and run the\n\nfamily business, unmolested by the Eritrean government.                  The IJ\n\nalso denied petitioners' applications for withholding of removal,\n\nprotection under the CAT, and voluntary departure.4\n\n            Zeru and Ghebrai retained a new attorney, Solomon Bekele,\n\nfor their appeal to the BIA.         On appeal, petitioners insisted they\n\nhad established past persecution.            They claimed that the IJ erred\n\nin   his    credibility    finding       because   he    improperly     demanded\n\nauthenticated documentary evidence to prove petitioners' claims.\n\nThey also objected to the IJ's use of demeanor in finding Zeru and\n\nGhebrai incredible.\n\n            Petitioners    described       inconsistencies        regarding    the\n\nnumber of Zeru's rapes as \"minor\" and explained them as lapses in\n\nmemory due to the passage of time.            Petitioners also claimed that\n\nthe second IJ did not observe proper procedures applicable upon\n\nassigning    a   new   judge   to   an    immigration     case.      Petitioners\n\nadditionally     argued   that      because    Zeru     had   established     past\n\n\n     4\n          Petitioners' brief does not advance any arguments\nregarding their claims for withholding of removal, protection under\nthe CAT, or voluntary departure.

Gonzales,\n</pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202438\"><a href=\"/opinion/202438/dine-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">464</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 93 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                      -12-\n\fpersecution, petitioners were entitled to a finding of well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution and a grant of their withholding of\n\nremoval claim.     Finally, petitioners made a perfunctory argument\n\nthat they qualified for protection under the CAT.\n\n            On February 7, 2006, the BIA affirmed, incorporating an\n\nearlier August 3, 2005 per curiam order. The BIA upheld both the\n\nlack   of    credibility       finding     and     the    finding    that   the\n\ninconsistencies were not sufficiently explained.               The BIA noted\n\nthat   it   did   not   find    persuasive       Zeru's   argument   that   the\n\ninconsistencies were caused by lapses of memory.               Further, that\n\nargument    did   not   explain    inconsistencies        in   Ghebrai's    and\n\nWeldemichael's testimony. The BIA also noted that the IJ allowably\n\nconsidered the demeanor of the witnesses.\n\n            The BIA also found a lack of corroborating evidence. The\n\nBIA noted that Zeru's immediate family members continued to reside\n\nin Eritrea without harm.           As to the argument that this was\n\nexplained by the fact that her family members were politically\n\ninactive, the BIA noted that was inconsistent with her husband's\n\ntestimony that he was not politically active, but nonetheless he\n\nhad been threatened repeatedly by security agents. In turn, it was\n\nimplausible that the husband, had he been threatened by government\n\nagents, would have been granted a passport and permitted to travel\n\nto the United States.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -13-\n\f            The BIA also addressed petitioners' argument regarding\n\nthe assignment of a new IJ to their case.       The BIA's decision made\n\nclear that the IJ complied with the requirement that he familiarize\n\nhimself with the record and so state on the record.        In fact, the\n\nIJ's opinion made repeated reference to details of petitioners'\n\ntestimony given in hearings presided over by the previous IJ.\n\nB.          Motion to Reopen\n\n            Zeru and Ghebrai, represented by new counsel, filed a\n\nmotion to reopen on May 5, 2006.        The motion was based on alleged\n\nnew information about Zeru's PTSD and on alleged ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel stemming from Bekele's representation during\n\nthe initial appeal.\n\n            Zeru and Ghebrai offered evidence tending to show that\n\nZeru's PTSD had worsened.      Zeru's evidence was that she suffered a\n\nbreakdown upon learning of her imminent deportation to Eritrea and\n\nwas hospitalized on November 12, 2005, for depression and suicidal\n\nthoughts.     Zeru submitted a letter from Dr. John Mirczak, a\n\npsychiatrist who treated her after her release from the hospital,\n\ndated February 1, 2006, and stating that Zeru suffered severe PTSD\n\nas a result of        \"multiple gang rapes . . . suffered while a\n\npolitical prisoner in Eritrea.\"         The letter further stated that\n\nZeru's symptoms would worsen if she were to return to Eritrea.\n\nPetitioners    also    submitted    a     \"supplementary   psychological\n\nassessment\" from Dr. Mirczak dated April 27, 2006.          Dr. Mirczak\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\fwrote that \"what can sometimes happen with trauma patients is that\n\nthey may dissociate\" and that their memories \"may be repressed.\"\n\nThe    supplemental     assessment     does     not    explicitly      ascribe    such\n\nsymptoms to Zeru.\n\n             The    motion     also   relied    on     three   other    letters       to\n\npetitioners' attorneys from mental health professionals regarding\n\nZeru's PTSD diagnosis.           The first, from a staff member at the\n\nPsychiatric Institute of Washington named Dianne Carlson, explained\n\nthat Zeru had flashbacks to her imprisonment and rapes, and that\n\nZeru used dissociation and denial to avoid re-experiencing past\n\ntraumas.      The     second    letter    contained      the   impressions       of    a\n\npsychologist, Jane McGoldrick, who met with Zeru twice in April\n\n2006.    McGoldrick wrote that Zeru referred in her meetings to her\n\nrape and torture, but that she was \"too tearful and distressed to\n\nreport details\" of those episodes. McGoldrick asserted that Zeru's\n\nrecovery was contingent upon the success of her asylum claim.\n\n             Finally, the motion to reopen presented a lengthy letter\n\nfrom    F.   Barton    Evans,     a   forensic        psychologist     retained       by\n\npetitioners' counsel to review the Wattenberg report and provide a\n\n\"literature        review\"   regarding     PTSD.         The   letter     aimed       at\n\ncontradicting the IJ's statement that \"it would not be unusual for\n\na victim of trauma to confuse dates or sequences of events, but it\n\nwould be very unusual for a victim of trauma to simply forget that\n\nan event occurred.\" The IJ was referring to the difference between\n\n\n                                         -15-\n\fZeru's testimony and what she told Wattenberg about the number of\n\ndifferent occasions on which she had been raped.                     Evans wrote that\n\nWattenberg's affidavit negated the IJ's statement because of its\n\nreference to Zeru \"recall[ing] feeling dissociated from her body\n\nduring these rapes\" and \"utiliz[ing] avoidant strategies.\"                       Evans\n\ncited several psychological studies for the proposition that PTSD\n\nvictims may suffer inconsistent recall of traumatic events.                       Evans\n\nwrote that \"from the perspective of the psychology of trauma, the\n\npresence of dissociative symptoms in fact adds believability to\n\n[Zeru's] report.\" Petitioners' motion to reopen explained that all\n\nof    the   foregoing         letters    \"challenged      the   credibility     finding\n\nstemming from Zeru's differing statements regarding the number of\n\ntimes she was raped.\"\n\n                 Zeru   and    Ghebrai    claimed       ineffective     assistance   of\n\ncounsel      because     \"Bekele's       work     was    egregiously    deficient    in\n\npreparation of\" the asylum appeal.                      This was so because Bekele\n\nfailed      to    address      adequately    in    his    brief   the    IJ's   adverse\n\ncredibility findings in general, and in particular \"the most\n\nimportant ground of appeal, namely the virtual elimination of the\n\ntestimony of [Wattenberg,] who was in the best position to address\n\n. . . Zeru's credibility.\"                  Petitioners argued that Bekele's\n\nfailures amounted to a due process violation. The motion to reopen\n\ndid   not    address      the    IJ's    decisions       regarding    withholding    of\n\nremoval, the CAT, or voluntary departure.\n\n\n                                            -16-\n\f           The BIA denied the motion to reopen on August 22, 2006,\n\nin a four-page, closely reasoned order discussing, inter alia, the\n\nspecifics of the new medical evidence.       The BIA noted the limited\n\nnature of the new evidence.       Mirczak's letter opined that Zeru's\n\nmemory \"could have been [a]ffected by dissociation, but overall she\n\nis being factual about the brutality that happened.\"          McGoldrick,\n\nwho said the disorder Zeru was suffering \"often has as symptoms\"\n\nmemory problems and amnesia for aspects of traumatic experiences,\n\ndid not say that Zeru suffered those symptoms.          The BIA stressed\n\nthat Evans did not even conduct a direct examination of Zeru.\n\n           The   BIA   met   head-on   Evans's   criticism   of   the   IJ's\n\nstatement that \"it would not be unusual for a victim of trauma to\n\nconfuse dates of sequences of events, but it would be very unusual\n\nfor a victim of trauma to simply forget that an event occurred.\"\n\nEven accepting Evans's criticism, the BIA held that it would not\n\nlikely have changed the outcome of the proceeding, for several\n\nreasons.    Zeru's inconsistent statements about the number of\n\noccasions on which she was raped were not the sole basis for the\n\nlack of credibility finding, which rested on numerous independent\n\ninconsistencies as well as upon the IJ's assessment of Zeru's\n\ndemeanor. Also, Zeru had failed to provide corroborating evidence.\n\nThe entire body of medical evidence rested on the credibility of\n\nher reports to the doctor, but the IJ had, based on substantial\n\nevidence, found her not to be credible in her reporting of her\n\n\n                                   -17-\n\fhistory. Further, the basic PTSD diagnosis evidence was before the\n\nBIA in the prior appeal and had been considered.\n\n              As to the ineffective assistance claim, the BIA reasoned\n\nthat it also failed because even considering the new evidence and\n\nnew emphasis on the effects of trauma on memory (the argument prior\n\ncounsel, it was argued, should have made), the respondent still had\n\nnot demonstrated that the outcome might have differed.\n\n              Zeru and Ghebrai timely petitioned to this court for\n\nreview of the BIA's rejection of their asylum appeal and the\n\nBoard's denial of the motion to reopen.\n\n                                      II.\n\n              Petitioners urge this court that \"the Petition for Review\n\nof the Motion [to Reopen] should . . . be held to be the functional\n\nequivalent of the direct appeal\" such that the two petitions would\n\nbe reviewed under the same standard and with reference to the\n\nentire administrative record.            Based on this misunderstanding,\n\npetitioners conflate their arguments challenging the denial of\n\nasylum and the denial of the motion to reopen.\n\n              The two petitions are legally distinct.

Denial of Asylum\n\n              Petitioners challenge the denial of asylum by attacking\n\nthe IJ's credibility findings.           Petitioners assert that the IJ did\n\nnot give sufficient weight to evidence provided by Wattenberg, who\n\n\"would have been able to address the impact of PTSD on Ms. Zeru's\n\nmemory and ability to recollect certain events related to her\n\ntrauma.\"      This is dispositive, petitioners argue, because they\n\ncharacterize the IJ's credibility finding as turning on Zeru's\n\ninconsistent testimony as to the number of times she was raped\n\nafter her imprisonment in 1987.             Petitioners also argue that the\n\ncredibility      finding,     to   the    extent   it   was    based   on     other\n\ninconsistent testimony or deficiencies in corroborating evidence,\n\nwas   based    on   trivial   or   immaterial      evidence.     We    hold    that\n\nsubstantial evidence supports the IJ's findings and deny the\n\npetition for review.\n\n              We must affirm an IJ's findings of fact, including the\n\ncredibility of witnesses, if they are \"supported by reasonable,\n\nsubstantial, and probative evidence on the record considered as a\n\n\n                                         -19-\n\fwhole.\"    INS v.

First,\n\nalthough Zeru told Wattenberg that she had been gang raped three\n\ntimes during her imprisonment from 1987-88, she testified to the IJ\n\nthat she had been raped once, and then later, that she had been\n\nraped twice.         Second, Zeru testified in August 1999 that in\n\nSeptember 1994, Eritrean security officers interrogated her for ten\n\nhours, at one point pointing a gun at her and threatening to kill\n\nher.    She testified that the encounter terrified her.                      In November\n\n2003,     however,     Zeru    described         the    episode    as    a    four-hour\n\nquestioning,    and     stated    that     she    did    not    take    the   officers'\n\nwarnings seriously.            Third, Zeru told Wattenberg that she met\n\nGhebrai when working at a pharmacy owned by her father.                               In\n\n\n                                          -20-\n\fcontrast, Zeru testified to the IJ that they met at the government\n\nhospital where Ghebrai worked and where Zeru did volunteer work.\n\nFourth, Zeru testified in 2000 that she completed twelfth grade,\n\nwhile in 2003 she testified that she attended school until the\n\ntenth grade.     Fifth, Zeru gave inconsistent testimony as to how\n\nlong she owned her own business in Asmara and what products her\n\nstore sold.\n\n           As to Ghebrai's testimony, the IJ noted inconsistencies\n\nas to when he learned of Zeru's participation in the ELF-RC, as\n\nwell as conflicting testimony regarding the location of Ghebrai's\n\nalleged encounters with Eritrean security forces searching for Zeru\n\nafter her departure to the United States.           The IJ also stressed\n\nthat Ghebrai's demeanor during his November 2003 testimony \"was one\n\nof a person who completely lacked v[e]racity.\"\n\n           Morever, the IJ cited discrepancies and omissions in the\n\npetitioners' corroborating documentary evidence that bolstered his\n\ndetermination of incredibility.        The document that Zeru offered as\n\nproof of her 1987-88 imprisonment could not be authenticated when\n\nshe sent a copy to the United States Embassy in Ethiopia.              There\n\nwere reasons to doubt another important document.              Petitioners'\n\nmarriage   certificate    revealed     an    inconsistency     with   Asmara\n\nmunicipal records regarding Zeru's date of birth, and the whited-\n\nout   document   displayed   signs    of    tampering.   The    documentary\n\nproblems continued:      Zeru testified that hospital records were\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\favailable in Eritrea to corroborate her outpatient treatment for\n\ndepression in 1988.    In spite of being advised by an IJ to obtain\n\nthose documents, and in spite of the fact that her family lives in\n\nproximity to the hospital in Eritrea, Zeru was able neither to\n\nproduce the hospital records nor to explain why she did not produce\n\nthem.   Nor was Zeru able to produce business records or the\n\nmandatory annual government permits for the business in Asmara that\n\nshe testified at various times to having operated for either one\n\nyear or for three and a half years.       Petitioners were not even able\n\nto produce, at an IJ's request, income tax filings, employment-\n\nrelated documents, or any other documents that could corroborate\n\nthat they were indeed married.\n\n          Petitioners      concede,       appropriately,       that   these\n\ndiscrepancies    are   \"specific    and    cogent\"   to    a    finding   of\n\nincredibility, and that some of them \"do go to the heart of the\n\nasylum claim.\"   Petitioners seem to suggest, however, that had the\n\nIJ given due weight to Wattenberg's testimony, her diagnosis of\n\nPTSD would have adequately explained the discrepancies in Zeru's\n\ntestimony regarding traumatic events, especially variations in the\n\nnumber of alleged rapes.\n\n          During their direct appeal to the BIA, petitioners did\n\nnot challenge the credibility determination on grounds that the\n\ninconsistencies resulted from PTSD. Instead, petitioners attempted\n\nat that stage to explain away testimonial inconsistencies as \"the\n\n\n                                   -22-\n\fresult of memory laps[e]\" due to the passage of time between events\n\nin Eritrea and the asylum hearings.      Issues not raised before the\n\nBIA generally may not be raised for the first time on a petition\n\nfor review.      Bernal-Vallejo v.

The IJ expressly\n\nacknowledged that \"it would not be unusual for a victim of trauma\n\nto confuse dates or sequences of events.\"            The IJ expressed his\n\ndoubt that such an effect would be sufficient to explain Zeru's\n\ndisparate statement to Wattenberg and her testimony as to the\n\nnumber of times she was raped.     No evidence was ever submitted by\n\npetitioners to contradict that specific doubt. Indeed, no specific\n\nevidence was submitted to the BIA on this point until the motion to\n\nreopen, when Evans addressed it in his letter, and he had not even\n\nmet Zeru.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -23-\n\f              Further,    even       assuming       arguendo      the   accuracy     of\n\nWattenberg's diagnosis of PTSD, petitioners do not claim that PTSD\n\nclouded Zeru's testimony regarding non-traumatic facts of life such\n\nas dates of birth, educational level, where she met her future\n\nspouse,   or    how    long    she   owned   her      own   business.         Nor   does\n\nWattenberg's report offer any explanation of the many gaps and\n\ncontradictions within petitioners' documentary evidence.                      Taken as\n\na    whole,    the    record   available       to    the    BIA   at    the   time   of\n\npetitioners' direct appeal provides substantial evidence in support\n\nof the IJ's credibility determination.\n\nB.            Denial of Motion to Reopen\n\n              Petitioners challenge the BIA's denial of the motion to\n\nreopen on two grounds.          They first assert a due process violation\n\nresulting from an alleged ineffective assistance of counsel during\n\nthe appeal of the asylum proceedings to the BIA.                    They also argue\n\nthat the BIA erred in discounting the newly presented evidence of\n\nZeru's PTSD in denying the motion to reopen.\n\n              Motions to reopen deportation proceedings are disfavored\n\ndue to the \"strong public interest in bringing litigation to a\n\nclose . . . promptly.\"           Fesseha, 333 F.3d at 20 (quoting INS v.\n\nAbudu, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112016\"><a href=\"/opinion/112016/ins-v-abudu/\"><span class=\"volume\">485</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">94</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 107 (1988)) (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\nThe normal deference granted agency decisions on motions to reopen\n\napplies with greater force in the immigration context because of\n\nthe implications for foreign relations.

Saakian, 252 F.3d at 25.\n\n            The gravamen of petitioners' argument before the BIA and\n\nthis court is that their appeal of the denial of asylum was\n\nprejudiced by Bekele's failure to challenge adequately the IJ's\n\ncredibility determination.           Petitioners peg their arguments to\n\ncounsel's    failure   to    argue    that       Wattenberg's   PTSD      diagnosis\n\nexplained the inconsistencies and undercut the lack of credibility\n\nfinding.\n\n            Neither the IJ nor the BIA rested either solely or\n\nnecessarily on Zeru's inconsistent testimony concerning traumatic\n\npast events in denying petitioners asylum.                 The BIA noted in its\n\ndenial of the motion to reopen that it had reviewed Wattenberg's\n\nreport and testimony.        The Board, informed by that information,\n\nconcluded that although petitioners had challenged some of the IJ's\n\nbases for his credibility determination, the board \"[did] not find\n\nthat [petitioners] have demonstrated that all bases . . . were\n\nerroneous.\"      Therefore, even if Bekele's initial appeal were\n\ndeficient in some respects, petitioners have failed to demonstrate\n\nthat the result would have been any different given their present\n\narguments.     In    addition,     \"the    Board's        careful   attention    to\n\n[petitioners']      motion   to   reopen     .    .   .   negated   any    possible\n\n\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\fviolation\" of petitioners' Fifth Amendment rights.                 Lozada, 857\n\nF.2d at 14.\n\n           Petitioners raise another due process issue related to\n\nWattenberg's     testimony.    Petitioners     argue   the    IJ    improperly\n\nlimited Wattenberg's testimony and thereby \"deprived Ms. Zeru of\n\nthe opportunity to present fundamental evidence critical to her\n\ncase.\"   Petitioners misstate the record.5        During the November 26,\n\n2003 hearing, the IJ admitted Wattenberg's Assessment Report into\n\nevidence   and   allowed   petitioners'     attorney   an    opportunity     to\n\nexamine Wattenberg beyond the report.          Counsel declined to do so.\n\nFollowing the government's cross-examination of Wattenberg, the IJ\n\noffered petitioners' counsel an opportunity to conduct redirect\n\nquestioning; counsel again declined.           Petitioners do not claim\n\ntheir representation before the IJ was deficient.              Further, the\n\nrecord reveals that the IJ reviewed Wattenberg's report in detail.\n\nPetitioners received a full and fair opportunity to present their\n\nexpert testimony.     That the IJ considered Wattenberg's testimony\n\nand reasonably discounted its evidentiary weight does not offend\n\nthe Fifth Amendment.\n\n           Finally,    petitioners     claim    that   the   BIA     erred   in\n\ndiscounting the new evidence of Zeru's PTSD accompanying the motion\n\nto reopen.     The BIA considered that evidence but concluded that\n\n\n     5\n          Unfortunately,      Zeru   has mischaracterized the record\nthroughout her brief,         and    amici have relied upon those\nmischaracterizations.\n\n                                     -27-\n\f\"evidence of [Zeru's] need for psychiatric care in late 2005 is not\n\na   sufficient        basis    to    overturn     the    comprehensive,        adverse\n\ncredibility finding from December 2003.\"                      Indeed, petitioners'\n\n\"new\" evidence simply reiterates Wattenberg's previous diagnosis of\n\nPTSD.     The    petitioners'        brief   concedes         that    \"[a]ll   of   this\n\ninformation could have been provided by Dr. Wattenberg if she had\n\nbeen given a chance to testify fully\" at the asylum hearings.\n\nWattenberg      was    given    that    chance.         The    PTSD    diagnosis     was\n\nconsidered during the asylum proceedings and before the BIA.                          We\n\ncannot say the BIA erred in holding the additional evidence of\n\nZeru's PTSD did not present \"new facts\" justifying a motion to\n\nreopen.     8 C.F.R. § 1003.2(c)(1); cf. Lemus v. Gonzales, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202778\"><a href=\"/opinion/202778/lemus-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">489</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">399</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 401 (1st Cir. 2007).              The BIA did not act arbitrarily or\n\ncapriciously in denying petitioners' motion.\n\n            We acknowledge the assistance provided by the brief filed\n\nby amici.    Zeru and amici correctly argue that the IJ and the BIA,\n\nin assessing credibility of aliens who are victims of trauma and\n\nconsequently suffer from PTSD, should be mindful that serious\n\nmemory problems are a common symptom of PTSD.                        See Br. of Amici\n\nCuriae in Support of the Pet'rs 18-19.                  They also correctly argue\n\nthat expert medical evidence may assist the agency.                      Id. 27-28.\n\n            The record reveals that the BIA and IJ adhered to both\n\nprinciples in this case.            The IJ explicitly recognized that trauma\n\nvictims may give discrepant testimony. The IJ articulated his view\n\n\n                                         -28-\n\fthat   this    did    not    explain    the    discrepancies     between    Zeru's\n\ntestimony and her report to Wattenberg as to the number of rapes.\n\nZeru's evidence did not dispute this drawing of the line by the IJ.\n\nContrary to Zeru's claim that the BIA rejected the new evidence of\n\nZeru's medical condition in 2005, the BIA carefully considered that\n\nevidence, as described.\n\n              Amici also join Zeru in arguing that she was not given a\n\nfair chance to respond to doubts about her credibility.                    Not so.\n\nThere is no presumption that an alien seeking refugee status is\n\ncredible.      Nor is there an assumption that if the IJ has not made\n\nan express finding of non-credibility, the alien's testimony must\n\nbe taken as credible.         The burden of persuasion is Zeru's, 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 1208.13(a), and that requires her to put forth sufficiently\n\ncredible testimony or other evidence to establish her eligibility\n\nfor asylum.\n\n              It was, or should have been, self-evident to Zeru and her\n\ncounsel      that    there    were    weaknesses      in   her   case   from   her\n\npresentation of evidence alone.            First, on the issue of the number\n\nof   times     she   had     been    raped,    she   was   inconsistent.       The\n\ninconsistency between her testimony to the IJ on that point and her\n\nstatements     to    Wattenberg      was   obvious.        Second,   Wattenberg's\n\naffidavit attempted to respond by saying that Zeru \"recall[ed]\n\nfeeling dissociated from her body\" during the rapes and adverted to\n\navoidance as a symptom of her PTSD.            Wattenberg was not barred from\n\n\n                                        -29-\n\fgiving further testimony on this point or from explaining the\n\ndiscrepancies.           Third, Zeru had the opportunity and means to\n\nprovide competent corroborative evidence. The documentary evidence\n\nshe presented appeared to be fraudulent. Fourth, during the course\n\nof the hearing, the IJ made it clear he had reason to doubt Zeru's\n\nclaims.       During one colloquy between Zeru and the IJ during the\n\nNovember 23, 2003, hearing, the IJ specifically pressed Zeru on\n\ninconsistencies between her testimony and facts contained in the\n\nWattenberg report.         For instance, the IJ asked Zeru multiple times\n\nwhether there were only two rapes during her imprisonment in\n\nEthiopia.       The IJ elicited Zeru's unequivocal denial that a third\n\nrape had occurred.          Thus Zeru herself contradicted what she told\n\nWattenberg.       The IJ also asked Zeru whether her father ever owned\n\na pharmacy, as stated in the Wattenberg report. Zeru answered that\n\nhe did not.      As for petitioners' suspect documentary evidence, the\n\nIJ indicated during the hearings that he had reason to believe they\n\nwere       fraudulent.     These   exchanges   put   petitioners   and   their\n\nattorney on notice of the IJ's misgivings, but petitioners never\n\noffered satisfactory explanations for any of these discrepancies.6\n\n\n\n\n       6\n          To the extent Zeru and amici argue that as a mechanical\nmatter the IJ must always, before the end of proceedings,\narticulate a belief that a petitioner is not credible and provide\nan additional opportunity to respond, we reject the argument.\nNeither the regulations nor procedural due process require such a\nprocedure. Indeed, it would be unusual.\n\n                                      -30-\n\f          There may be cases in which the failure by an IJ or the\n\nBIA to give due consideration to expert evidence regarding PTSD\n\njustifies dislodging a decision of the Board.

For the reasons\n\ndescribed, this is not such a case.\n\n          We affirm the decisions of the BIA.\n\n\n\n\n                              -31-\n\f</pre>",
