Ivan E. Irizarry, an employee of\n\nthe United States Small Business Administration (SBA), sued his\n\nemployer and several SBA employees         (collectively, the government)\n\nto challenge his transfer from Puerto Rico to Illinois as being\n\nunconstitutionally motivated by his political affiliation with the\n\nDemocratic   Party.      The    district   dismissed   the    complaint   and\n\nIrizarry appeals.      We affirm.\n\n          We review the dismissal order de novo.               See Roth v.\n\nUnited States, 952 F.2d 611, 613 (1st Cir. 1991).            In so doing, we\n\naccept the well-pleaded facts as true and draw all inferences in\n\nfavor of Irizarry.      See In re Colonial Mortg. Bankers Corp., 324\n\nF.3d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 2003).        We will affirm the dismissal of the\n\ncomplaint only if the well-pleaded facts fail to establish the\n\ngovernment's liability under some actionable legal theory.                See\n\nRodi v. S. New England Sch. of Law, 389 F.3d 5, 13 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          Prior to the 2000 presidential election, Irizarry worked\n\nas the Director of the SBA for Puerto Rico and the United States\n\nVirgin Islands.       In this position, Irizarry was covered by the\n\nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CRSA), Pub. L. 95-454 (codified\n\nin various provisions of Title 5 of the United States Code).\n\n          After   the    2000    election,    prominent   members   of    the\n\nRepublican Party in Puerto Rico began to pressure senior officials\n\nin the new administration to install Republicans as the heads of\n\nthe local offices of federal agencies.             As a result of this\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fpressure,      the   SBA   reassigned   Irizarry   to     the    post   of   Deputy\n\nDistrict Director for the District of Illinois.                 This transfer did\n\nnot change Irizarry's grade or pay.\n\n               Believing that the transfer violated his constitutional\n\nrights to free speech, free association, and due process, Irizarry\n\nfiled suit in federal district court in Puerto Rico.                    He sought\n\nreview of the action under the Administrative Procedures Act, 5\n\nU.S.C.    §§    701-706,    damages,    see   Bivens    v.    Six   Unknown   Fed.\n\nNarcotics Agents, 403 U.S. 388 (1971), and equitable relief in the\n\nform of reinstatement to his prior position.                 Before filing suit,\n\nIrizarry did not file an administrative complaint before the Office\n\nof Special Counsel (OSC) of the Merit System Protection Board\n\n(MSPB).\n\n               The   government   moved   to    dismiss       the   complaint   on\n\nalternate grounds: (1) Irizarry failed to file the administrative\n\ncomplaint that Congress intended as the exclusive means by which\n\nunconstitutionally transferred civil servants can obtain relief;\n\n(2) even if filing an administrative complaint is not the only way\n\nto obtain relief, it is a prerequisite to suing in federal court.\n\nThe district court accepted the government's first argument, ruling\n\nthat the CSRA precluded Irizarry from initiating a court action\n\nbecause he was limited to the remedies provided by the CSRA.                    We\n\ndo not reach this issue because we agree with the government's\n\nalternate argument:         that Irizarry was required, but failed, to\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fexhaust       his    administrative        remedies.          See,     e.g.,     Crellin\n\nTechnologies v. Equipmentlease Corp., 18 F.3d 1, 13 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n(appeals court may affirm the dismissal of a complaint on any\n\nindependently sufficient ground).\n\n              Congress      passed   the    CSRA     to    \"replace    the     haphazard\n\narrangements for administrative and judicial review of personnel\n\naction\" for civil service employees \"with an integrated scheme of\n\nadministrative        and    judicial      review,    designed       to    balance     the\n\nlegitimate interests of various categories of federal employees\n\nwith the needs of sound and efficient administration.\"                              United\n\nStates v. Fausto, 484 U.S. 439, 444-45 (1988).                   The CSRA provides\n\nremedies for prohibited personnel actions by federal agencies, 5\n\nU.S.C.    §    2302(a)(1),      which      include        employment      actions    that\n\ncontravene      an    employee's      constitutional          rights,      see   id.     §\n\n2301(b)(2).         Under the facts alleged by Irizarry, his transfer\n\ncould qualify.       See Rutan v. Republican Party of Ill., 497 U.S. 62,\n\n73-74 (1990) (holding that a transfer of a public employee on\n\naccount of political affiliation can violate the First Amendment).\n\n              The CSRA provides different remedial schemes depending on\n\nthe severity of the personnel action at issue.                            For the most\n\ndrastic actions, such as discharge, an employee is entitled to\n\nappeal the agency's decision directly to the MSPB.                           5 U.S.C. §\n\n7513(d).      If the employee does not prevail before the MSPB, she may\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fseek judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the\n\nFederal Circuit.    Id. § 7703.\n\n          An employee may not challenge a transfer by means of a\n\ndirect   appeal    to    the   MSPB.         Instead,    she   must   file   an\n\nadministrative complaint with the OSC. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 1212(a)(2),\n\n1214(a)(1)(A), 2302(a)(2)(A)(iv).            The OSC must \"investigate . . .\n\nto the extent necessary to determine whether there are reasonable\n\ngrounds to believe that a prohibited personnel action has occurred,\n\nexists, or is to be taken.\"            Id. § 1214(a)(1)(A).       If the OSC\n\ndetermines that such grounds exist, it may request that the agency\n\nrescind the action and, if the agency declines, petition the MSPB\n\nto take appropriate remedial steps.           See id. §§ 1214(b)(2)(B),(C).\n\nThe OSC is generally required to act on an administrative complaint\n\nwithin 240 days.        See id. § 1214(b)(2)(A).        If the OSC terminates\n\nthe investigation because it does not find reasonable grounds to\n\nconclude that a prohibited personnel action has or will occur, the\n\nOSC must tell the complaining employee the reason for its action.\n\nSee id. § 1214(a)(2)(A).\n\n          The CSRA does not provide for review by the MSPB or an\n\nArticle III court of an OSC decision to terminate an investigation\n\ninto an employee's complaint.1          The government argues that this\n\n\n     2\n      The CSRA contains an exception, not applicable here, which\nallows an employee to appeal to the MSPB (and eventually to the\nFederal Circuit) from the OSC's decision to terminate an\ninvestigation into a whistleblower claim.      See 5 U.S.C. §§\n1214(a)(3), 2302(b)(8).\n\n                                       -5-\n\fcongressional silence indicates that the OSC procedure is the\n\nexclusive avenue to relief.          Irizarry counters that, because the\n\nOSC's decision to intervene is discretionary, the CSRA does not\n\nprovide an adequate remedy to vindicate constitutional rights.\n\nTherefore,    Irizarry    contends    he    may   sue   in   federal   court   to\n\nvindicate his constitutional claim.           We assume arguendo that some\n\nform of Article III review is available to Irizarry, even though it\n\nis not expressly provided for by the CSRA.              Cf. Dugan v. Ramsay,\n\n727   F.2d   192,   194-95   (1st    Cir.   1984)   (federal    civil   servant\n\napplicant held entitled to obtain review of a personnel decision in\n\nfederal court because, under the CSRA, the claim could not find its\n\nway to the MSPB).2       Nevertheless, as we will explain, Irizarry's\n\n\n      2\n      Because we affirm on other grounds, we do not address the\ngovernment's contention that Dugan is so out-of-step with recent\nSupreme Court precedent that it is no longer good law. We do note,\nhowever, that Dugan was decided several years before the Court\nrecognized the preclusive effect of the CSRA in Fausto, 484 U.S. at\n455. We note also that several (although not all) of our sister\ncircuits have concluded that the CSRA precludes federal lawsuits\nfiled after the OSC has declined to act on an employee's claim.\nCompare Saul v. United States, 928 F.2d 829, 835-843 (9th Cir.\n1991) (barring action); Lombardi v. Small Business Admin., 889 F.2d\n959, 961(10th Cir. 1989)(same); Pinar v. Dole, 747 F.2d 899, 910-\n911 (4th Cir. 1984) (same) with Mitchum v. Hurt, 73 F.3d 30, 35 (3d\nCir. 1995) (allowing federal court action by federal employee to\nobtain injunctive relief); Spagnola v. Mathis, 859 F.2d 223, 229\n(D.C. Cir. 1988) (en banc) (per curiam) (same).\n     While we do not decide whether Dugan remains good law, we do\nreject the government's assertion that we effectively overruled\nDugan in Berrios v. Dep't of the Army, 884 F.2d 28 (1st Cir. 1989).\nIn Berrios, we held that the plaintiff could not sue over his\ndischarge because the CSRA provided his exclusive remedy and did\nnot include a direct action in federal district court. Id. at 31.\nBerrios is distinguishable because, unlike here, the CSRA provided\nthat the plaintiff could obtain review of his discharge at the\n\n                                      -6-\n\fcomplaint was properly dismissed because he did not exhaust his\n\nremedies by first filing a complaint with the OSC.3\n\n            Requiring exhaustion of administrative remedies serves\n\nimportant purposes.      See McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 144\n\n(1992).   It protects administrative agency authority and promotes\n\njudicial efficiency.     See id.; see also Portela-Gonzalez v. Sec'y\n\nof the Navy, 109 F.3d 74, 77 (1st Cir. 1997).                It also prevents\n\nlitigants   from    bypassing   Congress'     carefully      crafted   remedial\n\nscheme.     See Andrade v. Lauer, 729 F.2d 1475, 1484 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1984).\n\n            These   policy    goals,    and   the    lack   of   countervailing\n\ninterests, favor requiring a federal employee to file a claim with\n\nthe OSC before repairing to federal court.             \"The CSRA established\n\na   comprehensive    system    for   reviewing      personnel    actions   taken\n\nagainst federal employees.\"          Fausto, 484 U.S. at 455.        Permitting\n\nan employee to bypass the OSC entirely would permit the employee to\n\navoid the remedial scheme that Congress enacted, even though\n\n\nFederal Circuit.     See id.\n      3\n      We reject Irizarry's contention that we took a contrary\nposition in Dugan, 727 F.2d at 194. In Dugan, the plaintiff filed\nsuit in federal district court without first filing a claim with\nthe OSC.   Id.   The district court, sua sponte, dismissed the\ncomplaint on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to exhaust\nadministrative remedies. Id. We reversed. Id. In so doing, we\nrelied on the government's concession that the plaintiff did not\nhave to file a claim with the OSC as a prerequisite to filing a\nsuit in federal court.    Id.   In light of this concession, we\nconcluded that the government had waived its entitlement to raise\nthe administrative exhaustion bar. Id. Not so here.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fnothing in the CSRA suggests that Congress intended resort to the\n\nOCS to be optional.    Cf. Velazquez-Rivera v. Danzig, 234 F.3d 790,\n\n794 (1st Cir. 2000) (ruling that plaintiff forfeited any federal\n\ncourt review of his termination by not following the procedures set\n\nforth in the CSRA).    By contrast, requiring exhaustion permits the\n\nfederal agency to correct the violation or to explain its decision.\n\nThis promotes agency authority and accountability.        See Martin v.\n\nUnited States Env. Protection Agency, 271 F. Supp. 2d 38, 45\n\n(D.D.C. 2000).     Moreover, the OSC remedy provides a method for\n\nresolving   many   employment   disputes   without   turning   them   into\n\nfederal cases. This reduces the caseload of the federal courts and\n\nrelieves the courts from serving as \"super personnel boards.\"\n\nDiPrio v. Taft, 584 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1978).4\n\n            Irizarry argues that he should have been excused from\n\ncomplaining to the OSC because the OSC has discretion whether to\n\nact on his administrative complaint and need not address the\n\nmerits.   The D.C. Circuit rejected this same argument:\n\n\n\n\n     4\n      Several courts, which may permit an employee in Irizarry's\nposition to sue in federal court, require administrative\nexhaustion.   See Weaver v. United States Info. Agency, 87 F.3d\n1429, 1433-34 (D.C. Cir. 1996) (dismissing the plaintiff's claim\nthat an oral admonishment violated his right to free speech because\nthe plaintiff did not first file the claim with the OSC); see also\nMartin, 271 F. Supp. 2d at 45 (dismissing suit for failure to\nexhaust OSC remedy); United States v. Perdeaux, 33 F. Supp. 2d 187,\n190 (E.D.N.Y. 1999) (similar).    But see Mitchum, 73 F.3d at 35\n(permitting federal employee to pursue claim for injunctive relief\nwithout exhausting administrative remedies).\n\n                                  -8-\n\f            Although the OSC discretion adds an\n            element of uncertainty that is distinct\n            from the ordinary vicissitudes of agency\n            proceedings, Congress evidently thought\n            it adequate in view of the relatively\n            minor character of the wrongs whose\n            redress is left to OSC discretion,\n            perhaps fearing that a universal right of\n            appeal to the MSPB would cause trivial\n            claims to delay and crowd out more\n            serious ones.\n\nWeaver v. United States Info. Agency, 87 F.3d 1429, 1433-34 (D.C.\n\nCir. 1996).   This reasoning comports with the Supreme Court's and\n\nthis court's decisions mandating that federal employees comply\n\nwith the CSRA's remedial procedures. See Fausto, 484 U.S. at 455;\n\n Velazquez-Rivera, 234 F.3d at 794; Berrios, 884 F.2d at 884.\n\n            A discriminatory transfer of the sort Irizarry allegedly\n\nsuffered is not a trivial slight.           But we think it clear that\n\nCongress intended that complaints about such transfers be directed\n\nto the OSC.      If federal court review is available to Irizarry at\n\nall,   it   is     only   available     following   the   exhaustion   of\n\nadministrative remedies.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\f",

In this position, Irizarry was covered by the\n\nCivil Service Reform Act of 1978 (CRSA), Pub. L. 95-454 (codified\n\nin various provisions of Title 5 of the United States Code).\n\n          After   the    2000    election,    prominent   members   of    the\n\nRepublican Party in Puerto Rico began to pressure senior officials\n\nin the new administration to install Republicans as the heads of\n\nthe local offices of federal agencies.             As a result of this\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fpressure,      the   SBA   reassigned   Irizarry   to     the    post   of   Deputy\n\nDistrict Director for the District of Illinois.                 This transfer did\n\nnot change Irizarry's grade or pay.\n\n               Believing that the transfer violated his constitutional\n\nrights to free speech, free association, and due process, Irizarry\n\nfiled suit in federal district court in Puerto Rico.                    He sought\n\nreview of the action under the Administrative Procedures Act, 5\n\nU.S.C.    §§    701-706,    damages,    see   Bivens    v.

Before filing suit,\n\nIrizarry did not file an administrative complaint before the Office\n\nof Special Counsel (OSC) of the Merit System Protection Board\n\n(MSPB).\n\n               The   government   moved   to    dismiss       the   complaint   on\n\nalternate grounds: (1) Irizarry failed to file the administrative\n\ncomplaint that Congress intended as the exclusive means by which\n\nunconstitutionally transferred civil servants can obtain relief;\n\n(2) even if filing an administrative complaint is not the only way\n\nto obtain relief, it is a prerequisite to suing in federal court.\n\nThe district court accepted the government's first argument, ruling\n\nthat the CSRA precluded Irizarry from initiating a court action\n\nbecause he was limited to the remedies provided by the CSRA.

For the most\n\ndrastic actions, such as discharge, an employee is entitled to\n\nappeal the agency's decision directly to the MSPB.                           5 U.S.C. §\n\n7513(d).      If the employee does not prevail before the MSPB, she may\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\fseek judicial review in the United States Court of Appeals for the\n\nFederal Circuit.    Id. § 7703.\n\n          An employee may not challenge a transfer by means of a\n\ndirect   appeal    to    the   MSPB.         Instead,    she   must   file   an\n\nadministrative complaint with the OSC. See 5 U.S.C. §§ 1212(a)(2),\n\n1214(a)(1)(A), 2302(a)(2)(A)(iv).            The OSC must \"investigate . . .\n\nto the extent necessary to determine whether there are reasonable\n\ngrounds to believe that a prohibited personnel action has occurred,\n\nexists, or is to be taken.\"            Id. § 1214(a)(1)(A).       If the OSC\n\ndetermines that such grounds exist, it may request that the agency\n\nrescind the action and, if the agency declines, petition the MSPB\n\nto take appropriate remedial steps.           See id. §§ 1214(b)(2)(B),(C).\n\nThe OSC is generally required to act on an administrative complaint\n\nwithin 240 days.        See id. § 1214(b)(2)(A).        If the OSC terminates\n\nthe investigation because it does not find reasonable grounds to\n\nconclude that a prohibited personnel action has or will occur, the\n\nOSC must tell the complaining employee the reason for its action.\n\nSee id. § 1214(a)(2)(A).\n\n          The CSRA does not provide for review by the MSPB or an\n\nArticle III court of an OSC decision to terminate an investigation\n\ninto an employee's complaint.1          The government argues that this\n\n\n     2\n      The CSRA contains an exception, not applicable here, which\nallows an employee to appeal to the MSPB (and eventually to the\nFederal Circuit) from the OSC's decision to terminate an\ninvestigation into a whistleblower claim.      See 5 U.S.C. §§\n1214(a)(3), 2302(b)(8).\n\n                                       -5-\n\fcongressional silence indicates that the OSC procedure is the\n\nexclusive avenue to relief.          Irizarry counters that, because the\n\nOSC's decision to intervene is discretionary, the CSRA does not\n\nprovide an adequate remedy to vindicate constitutional rights.\n\nTherefore,    Irizarry    contends    he    may   sue   in   federal   court   to\n\nvindicate his constitutional claim.           We assume arguendo that some\n\nform of Article III review is available to Irizarry, even though it\n\nis not expressly provided for by the CSRA.              Cf. Dugan v.

See id.\n      3\n      We reject Irizarry's contention that we took a contrary\nposition in Dugan, 727 F.2d at 194. In Dugan, the plaintiff filed\nsuit in federal district court without first filing a claim with\nthe OSC.   Id.   The district court, sua sponte, dismissed the\ncomplaint on the ground that the plaintiff had failed to exhaust\nadministrative remedies. Id. We reversed. Id.

Not so here.\n\n                                       -7-\n\fnothing in the CSRA suggests that Congress intended resort to the\n\nOCS to be optional.    Cf. Velazquez-Rivera v.

Moreover, the OSC remedy provides a method for\n\nresolving   many   employment   disputes   without   turning   them   into\n\nfederal cases.
