The government challenges a\n\ndownward departure in the sentencing of Alfred Craven, a leader of\n\nan   elaborate    marijuana       trafficking    venture   that   operated   for\n\nseveral years in California and Massachusetts.             The district court\n\nfound that Craven, a former drug user, had demonstrated such\n\n“extraordinary rehabilitation” in changing his lifestyle prior to\n\nhis arrest that he was entitled to a 37-month downward departure in\n\nhis sentence.         The government contests this finding, citing a\n\nrecord of eighteen disciplinary violations by the defendant during\n\nhis presentencing detention.            We reverse.\n\n                 I.        Factual and Procedural Background\n\n           This       is    not   the   first   occasion   on   which   we   have\n\nconsidered the sentence of Alfred Craven.              See United States v.\n\nCraven, 239 F.3d 91 (1st Cir. 2001).                We recite the pertinent\n\nbackground in brief, leaving some of the details to our earlier\n\nopinion.      See id.       In June 1999, Craven pleaded guilty to nine\n\ncrimes committed in connection with his role in a longstanding\n\nmarijuana distribution scheme.             After a series of hearings, the\n\ndistrict court (Gertner, J.) granted a 37-month downward departure\n\nfor extraordinary rehabilitation, sentencing Craven to 151 months\n\nin prison.1    In reaching its decision, the district court relied on\n\n\n      1\n      Craven otherwise would have been subject to a sentence of 188\nto 235 months, a sentencing-range calculation that already included\n(1) a 3-level acceptance-of-responsibility reduction, and (2) an\nadjustment of his criminal history category from III to I on the\nground that the presentence report's category-III classification\n\n                                         -2-\n\fan ex parte conversation with an expert witness appointed by the\n\ncourt to evaluate Craven’s claims of rehabilitation from drug\n\naddiction. The government appealed, alleging that (1) the district\n\ncourt abused its discretion in relying on its conversation with the\n\nexpert    in    its   sentencing    determination,       and    (2)   the   record\n\notherwise       failed    to   support       a   finding       of   extraordinary\n\nrehabilitation.        Agreeing with the first of the government’s two\n\ncontentions, we vacated and remanded for re-sentencing before\n\nanother judge.        See generally id.\n\n               On remand, the district court (Tauro, J.) heard the in-\n\ncourt testimony and cross-examination of the expert witness whose\n\nex parte conversation with the first sentencing judge had been the\n\nsubject of the government’s first appeal.2              Dr. Laurence Weisman,\n\na   clinical     psychologist,     testified     that   he   had    met   with   the\n\ndefendant on one occasion in January 2000 and had reviewed his\n\npresentence report. According to his interview with the defendant,\n\n\n\noverstated Craven's culpability.\n      2\n      In a hearing prior to the testimony of the expert witness,\nJudge Tauro stated that he had reached the same preliminary\nconclusions regarding sentencing that Judge Gertner had reached\nbefore her ex parte conversation with the witness, stating \"I am\njust where Judge Gertner was when she responded that she didn’t\nhave enough to do anything with respect to the changed\ncircumstances and his redemption.      And I agree with her with\nrespect to all the other issues of the gun [enhancement], all that.\nIt is exactly the same as where she was.\" Judge Tauro said that he\nwould hear from the expert in court, and that if he was \"impressed\nwith his testimony,\" then he would \"probably give [Craven] the same\nsentence as [Judge Gertner] did.”\n\n                                       -3-\n\fCraven had struggled with drug addiction throughout his life but\n\nhad stopped using drugs and alcohol about a year before his arrest,\n\nat a time when he was aware that he was the subject of a criminal\n\ninvestigation.     Craven had also become more involved in caring for\n\nhis young son and had begun working a full-time job.                   Dr. Weisman\n\ntestified that Craven had demonstrated “significant insight and\n\nresponsibility for his behaviors,” and had recognized a need to\n\nturn his life around by addressing his drug addiction.                   According\n\nto Dr. Weisman, Craven was “intent [o]n taking responsibility for\n\nhimself     and        changing      .     .         .      his        lifestyle.\n\n           Dr.     Weisman    had    reviewed    Craven’s          presentencing\n\ndisciplinary records prior to testifying, although he had not seen\n\nthem   during    his   original   evaluation    of       Craven   in   2000.    He\n\ntestified that Craven’s disciplinary problems had not changed his\n\nearlier opinion about the prognosis for Craven. In his 2000 expert\n\nreport, Dr. Weisman had concluded:\n\n           As with any individual attempting to overcome\n           a background of addiction and criminal\n           lifestyle, the prognosis remains guardedly\n           optimistic if the individual participates in a\n           comprehensive, longterm recovery program. Mr.\n           Craven appears to have demonstrated both the\n           willingness and capability which would make\n           him a good candidate to succeed.\n\n(emphasis in original).      Dr. Weisman's opinion remained unchanged\n\nlargely because Craven's misconduct during presentencing detention\n\nwas not “beyond the norm” of what he would expect from someone who\n\nis incarcerated. As Dr. Weisman recalled the disciplinary records,\n\n                                     -4-\n\fCraven had had a dispute with a guard and had been found with\n\nhomemade alcohol.    But he had not been violent or cruel towards\n\nanyone.\n\n            On   cross-examination,   Dr.   Weisman    was   asked   about\n\nparticular incidents in which Craven had been disciplined.             The\n\ndisciplinary records documented eighteen episodes of misconduct,\n\nincluding incidents in which Craven had punched one inmate in the\n\nface with a closed fist, headbutted another, and repeatedly elbowed\n\na third in the face while holding him down.            Craven was also\n\ndisciplined for numerous incidents of insubordination.3         Also, as\n\nDr. Weisman had acknowledged on direct, Craven was once found in\n\npossession of homemade alcohol.\n\n            In response to this questioning, Dr. Weisman conceded\n\nthat some of the incidents were violent.       But he concluded that\n\nCraven was in an environment where there was a lot of fighting and\n\nthat Craven’s behavior was better than other inmates’ because he\n\nwould at least “cuff up,” or allow himself to be handcuffed, when\n\nultimately ordered to do so by an officer.            Dr. Weisman found\n\nCraven’s willingness to respond to an order to be significant for\n\n\n\n     3\n      According to one report, Craven was once found kicking his\ncell door. When the door was opened to allow a cellmate to leave\nfor kitchen duty, Craven ran out of the cell, yelling that the\nofficer who had opened the door was “going to get hurt” and was “a\nfucking asshole.” On another occasion, when an officer told Craven\nto stop kicking his cell door and making disruptive animal noises,\nCraven told the officer to take his disciplinary report and “wipe\n[his] ass with it, that’s all it’s good for.”\n\n                                -5-\n\fsomeone who was raised without discipline or structure.                          Dr.\n\nWeisman testified that his conclusion regarding Craven’s prognosis\n\nremained the same despite these incidents, stating that “within the\n\nextremes of a perfect record and an out-of-control, unmanageable\n\nend at the other, clearly he falls within limits that in my mind\n\nstill bode for the same outcome and the same intervention.”\n\n             The district court sentenced Craven to 151 months, which\n\nconstituted a 37-month downward departure from the 188- to 235-\n\nmonth range to which he otherwise would have been subject.                        The\n\nsentence was     identical     to    the   sentence      imposed   by    the   first\n\nsentencing    judge.     The   district        court    found   that    Craven   had\n\ndemonstrated extraordinary rehabilitation by refraining from drug\n\nuse and drug sales for a period of nearly two years prior to his\n\narrest.   The court noted that the defendant’s disciplinary record\n\nafter his first sentencing was good, and described the defendant’s\n\nprior disciplinary violations as “a period of aberrant behavior\n\nthat the doctor himself explained.             It’s as though it was some sort\n\nof   pressure   cooker   that       he   was    going    into   and     the    doctor\n\nunderstands that.” In its statement of reasons, the district court\n\nconcluded:\n\n             Defendant's post offense rehabilitation is so\n             extraordinary as to warrant the downward\n             departure.    The court has found that the\n             defendant's fundamental change in attitude and\n             radical alteration in lifestyle entitle the\n             defendant to the downward departure.\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\f                                II.      Analysis\n\n            As   in   Craven       I,   we    begin    by     acknowledging       that\n\n“[o]rdinarily, presentence rehabilitation is not a permissible\n\nground for departure because it can be factored adequately into the\n\nsentencing equation by an acceptance-of-responsibility credit.”\n\nCraven, 239 F.2d at 99 (citing U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual §\n\n3E1.1, cmt. n.1(g)). Even so, in extraordinary circumstances, such\n\na departure may be appropriate.              See id.       In determining whether\n\nthese circumstances are present, we engage in a three-pronged\n\nanalysis:\n\n            we evaluate whether the circumstances cited by\n            the district court are sufficiently unusual to\n            justify the departure. If so, we next inquire\n            into   whether    those   circumstances    are\n            adequately documented in the record. If the\n            departure clears these two hurdles, we then\n            measure its reasonableness.\n\nId.   The defendant bears the burden of proving that he is eligible\n\nfor a downward departure.          United States v. Sachdev, 279 F.3d 25,\n\n28 (1st Cir. 2002).          The parties dispute whether we should give\n\nsome deference to the district court’s findings in the wake of the\n\nPROTECT Act, Pub. L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650 (2003); see United\n\nStates v. Frazier, 340 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir. 2003), but we need not\n\nresolve this issue because we find that the downward departure is\n\nnot   sustainable     even     under    the    more    deferential        tripartite\n\nstandard.    See United States v. Sanchez, --- F.3d ---, Nos. 02-\n\n2504,   02-2566,      2004    WL    32864,     at     *7    (1st   Cir.    Jan.    7,\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\f2004)(reviewing           a    departure       claim    without      determining    which\n\nstandard of review applies by using the more defendant-friendly of\n\nthe standards).\n\n               Looking to the first of the three applicable questions,\n\nthe    only    identified            bases    for    concluding    that   extraordinary\n\nrehabilitation had occurred were the district court's findings that\n\nthere had been a presentencing period of almost two years without\n\ndrug       selling   or       drug    use,4    that    there   had    been    a   \"radical\n\nalteration\" in Craven's lifestyle, and that Craven’s prison record\n\nhad been clean in the two years after sentencing.                            The question\n\nbefore us is whether the district court acted within its discretion\n\nin concluding that this rehabilitation is so extraordinary that it\n\nmerits a downward departure.5                   As we noted in Craven I, “[t]he\n\ntouchstone of extraordinary rehabilitation is a fundamental change\n\nin attitude.”         Craven, 239 F.3d at 100.                    There, we expressed\n\nconsiderable skepticism as to whether a downward departure would be\n\nappropriate in light of Craven's presentencing disciplinary record.\n\n\n       4\n      The defendant in fact had stated that he had ceased drug use\napproximately thirteen months prior to his arrest.\n       5\n      In two prior cases, we have rejected downward departures on\nthe basis of rehabilitation from drug addiction. See United States\nv. Rushby, 936 F.2d 41, 43 (1st Cir. 1991); United States v. Sklar,\n920 F.2d 107, 117 (1st Cir. 1990). Craven attempts to distinguish\nthese cases because the defendants’ rehabilitative efforts in\nRushby and Sklar began after their respective arrests. In Craven\nI we found this distinction to be insignificant, noting the\ndistrict court’s finding that Craven was aware that he was the\nsubject of a criminal investigation before he began his\nrehabilitation efforts.\n\n                                               -8-\n\fSee id.      We left open the possibility, however, that some portion\n\nof the ex parte communication between the court and the expert\n\nwitness (later recounted as in-court testimony on remand) might\n\nhave rendered Craven's situation unique.                        See id. at 100-01.\n\n              We are no more persuaded by the defendant's evidence of\n\nrehabilitation          on     remand    than    we    were     in    Craven    I.      Surely\n\nextraordinary       rehabilitation             means   something       more     than    merely\n\nbehaving lawfully after years of criminal activity.                             Even if the\n\ndefendant's conduct in the period preceding his arrest could meet\n\nthe high threshold for a downward departure, his disruptive and\n\nsometimes     violent          behavior        while   detained        before       sentencing\n\nundermines        his    claim     of     extraordinary         rehabilitation.             Dr.\n\nWeisman's testimony that Craven's conduct was \"within the extremes\"\n\nof   what    he    would        expect    from    someone       who    was     adjusting     to\n\nincarceration hardly distinguishes the defendant from the heartland\n\nof   other    offenders          who     claim     rehabilitation.             Under    these\n\ncircumstances,           the     district        court's      finding        that     Craven's\n\nrehabilitation          was     different       from   the    ordinary       case     was   not\n\nplausible.        Cf. United States v. Cunningham, 201 F.3d 20, 28 (1st\n\nCir. 2000).        Because we so find, we do not address whether the\n\ncircumstances           cited     by     the    district      court     were        adequately\n\ndocumented, or whether the departure was reasonable.\n\n                                   III.         Conclusion\n\n             For    the        foregoing       reasons,    we    reverse       the    downward\n\n\n                                                -9-\n\fdeparture   and   remand   for   resentencing   within   the   applicable\n\nguidelines sentencing range of 188 to 235 months.\n\n            So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\f",

Dr. Weisman's opinion remained unchanged largely because Craven's misconduct during presentencing detention was not \"beyond the norm\" of what he would expect from someone who is incarcerated. As Dr. Weisman recalled the disciplinary records, Craven had had a dispute with a guard and had been found with homemade alcohol. But he had not been violent or cruel towards anyone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On cross-examination, Dr. Weisman was asked about particular incidents in which Craven had been disciplined. The disciplinary records documented eighteen episodes of misconduct, including incidents in which Craven had punched one inmate in the face with a closed fist, head-butted another, and repeatedly elbowed a third in the face while holding him down. Craven was also disciplined for numerous incidents of insubordination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Also, as Dr. Weisman had acknowledged on direct, Craven was once found in possession of homemade alcohol.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In response to this questioning, Dr. Weisman conceded that some of the incidents were violent. But he concluded that Craven was in an environment where there was a lot of fighting and that Craven's behavior was better than other inmates' because he would at least \"cuff up,\" or allow himself to be handcuffed, when ultimately ordered to do so by an officer. Dr. Weisman found Craven's willingness to respond to an order to be significant for someone who was raised without discipline or structure. Dr. Weisman testified that his conclusion regarding Craven's prognosis remained the same despite these incidents, stating that \"within the extremes of a perfect record and an out-of-control, unmanageable end at the other, clearly he falls within limits that in my mind still bode for the same outcome and the same intervention.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court sentenced Craven to 151 months, which constituted a 37-month downward departure from the 188- to 235-month range to which he otherwise would have been subject. The sentence was identical to the sentence imposed by the first sentencing judge. The district court found that Craven had demonstrated extraordinary rehabilitation by refraining from drug use and drug sales for a period of nearly two years prior to his arrest. The court noted that the defendant's disciplinary record after his first sentencing was good, and described the defendant's prior disciplinary violations as \"a period of aberrant behavior that the doctor himself explained. It's as though it was some sort of pressure cooker that he was going into and the doctor understands that.\" In its statement of reasons, the district court concluded:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant's post offense rehabilitation is so extraordinary as to warrant the downward departure.

Even so, in extraordinary circumstances, such a departure may be appropriate. <i>See id.</i> In determining whether these circumstances are present, we engage in a three-pronged analysis:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">we evaluate whether the circumstances cited by the district court are sufficiently unusual to justify the departure.

Sachdev,</i> 279 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir.2002). The parties dispute whether we should give some deference to the district court's findings in the wake of the PROTECT Act, Pub.L. No. 108-21, 117 Stat. 650 (2003); <i>see United States v. Frazier,</i> 340 F.3d 5, 14 (1st Cir.2003), but we need not resolve this issue because we find that the downward departure is not sustainable even under the more deferential tripartite standard. <i>See United States v.

There, we expressed considerable skepticism as to whether a downward departure would be appropriate in light of Craven's presentencing disciplinary record. <i>See id.</i> We left open the possibility, however, that some portion of the ex parte communication between the court and the expert witness (later recounted as in-court testimony on remand) might have rendered Craven's situation unique. <i>See id.</i> at 100-01.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are no more persuaded by the defendant's evidence of rehabilitation on remand than we were in <i>Craven I.</i> Surely <i>extraordinary</i> rehabilitation means something more than merely behaving lawfully after years of criminal activity. Even if the defendant's conduct in the period preceding his arrest could meet the high threshold for a downward departure, his disruptive and sometimes violent behavior while detained before sentencing undermines his claim of extraordinary rehabilitation. Dr. Weisman's testimony that Craven's conduct was \"within the extremes\" of what he would expect from someone who was adjusting to incarceration hardly distinguishes the defendant from the heartland of other offenders who claim rehabilitation. Under these circumstances, the district court's finding that Craven's rehabilitation was different from the ordinary case was not plausible. <i>Cf. United States v.

We recite the pertinent background in brief, leaving some of the details to our earlier opinion. <i>See id.</i> In June 1999, Craven pleaded guilty to nine crimes committed in connection with his role in a longstanding marijuana distribution scheme. After a series of hearings, the district court (Gertner, J.) granted a 37-month downward departure for extraordinary rehabilitation, sentencing Craven to 151 months in prison.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> In reaching its decision, the district court relied on an ex parte conversation with an expert witness appointed by the court to evaluate Craven's claims of rehabilitation from drug addiction. The government appealed, alleging that (1) the district court abused its discretion in relying on its conversation with the expert in its sentencing determination, and (2) the record otherwise failed to support a finding of extraordinary rehabilitation.

According to his interview with the defendant, Craven had struggled with drug addiction throughout his life but had stopped using drugs and alcohol about a year before his arrest, at a time when he was aware that he was the subject of a criminal investigation. Craven had also become more involved in caring for his young son and had begun working a full-time job. Dr. Weisman testified that Craven had demonstrated \"significant insight and responsibility for his behaviors,\" and had recognized a need to turn his life around by addressing his drug addiction.
