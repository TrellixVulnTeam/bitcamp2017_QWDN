This case concerns the grounds for\n\nestablishing the liability of a hospital under the Emergency\n\nMedical   Treatment   and    Active     Labor      Act    (EMTALA),     42   U.S.C.\n\n§ 1395dd.     EMTALA requires hospitals to provide emergency room\n\npatients with an appropriate medical screening designed to identify\n\nemergency conditions.       Contending that Hospital Interamericano de\n\nMedicina Avanzada, Inc.-Humacao (HIMA) provided such a minimal\n\nscreening   for   Narciso    Figueroa       that   it     could   not   be   deemed\n\nappropriate, the plaintiffs appeal the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment to HIMA.       We affirm.\n\n                              I.   Background\n\n            In reviewing an award of summary judgment, we \"view the\nentire record in the light most hospitable to the party opposing\n\nsummary judgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in that\nparty's favor.\"    Griggs-Ryan v. Smith, 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir.\n\n1990).    We state the facts accordingly.\n\n            On October 2, 1998, at approximately 9:50 P.M., Maria del\nCarmen Guadalupe took her husband, Narciso Figueroa, to the Yabucoa\nDiagnostic and Treatment Center (YDTC).                  Figueroa was suffering\nfrom urinary retention, edema in his legs, high blood pressure, and\n\npain. The YDTC referred Figueroa to HIMA, where he arrived at 1:05\n\nA.M. on October 3, 1998, accompanied by del Carmen Guadalupe.                   By\n\nthis time, Figueroa was also suffering from increased respiratory\n\ndifficulty, a dry cough, fever, and drowsiness.\n\n     When he arrived at HIMA, Figueroa was joined by his niece, a\n\nnurse who worked at the hospital (but was off duty at the time).\n\n                                      -2-\n\fShe spoke to the doctor on call, Dr. Samuel Negron Agosto.                        While\n\ndel Carmen Guadalupe filled out paperwork at the front desk of the\n\nhospital, Dr. Negron Agosto examined                  Figueroa.      Atlhough there\nwere other patients in the emergency room, Figueroa was examined\n\nbefore them. At least two nurses also attended to Figueroa, taking\n\nhis vital signs, drawing blood, and arranging for an x-ray of his\nchest.     The nurses also checked the Foley catheter (designed to\n\ndrain urine) that had been attached to Figueroa before he arrived.\n\nFigueroa was conscious the whole time, communicating to family\n\nmembers and health care workers.\n\n       After reviewing an x-ray, Dr. Negron Agosto diagnosed Figueroa\n\nwith bronchial pneumonia.           In her deposition, del Carmen Guadalupe\n\nclaimed that Dr. Negron Agosto told Figueroa's niece (the nurse)\nthat   Figueroa      could   be    discharged        because   \"nobody     dies     from\n\n[bronchial pneumonia].\"            Before del Carmen Guadalupe left with\n\nFigueroa, Dr. Negron Agosto gave her some medicine and told her to\ngive it to Figueroa once they got home and to return to the\n\nhospital    the   next   day      to    pick    up   the   x-ray.        Figueroa    was\n\ndischarged at about 3:00 A.M., and del Carmen Guadalupe drove him\n\nback home by 5:00 A.M.            He was conscious and speaking during the\n\njourney, and did not complain about his treatment at the hospital.\n\n       After del Carmen Guadalupe and Figueroa returned to their\n\nhome, they looked for the medicine, but could not find it.                       Rather\n\nthan     returning     for   a     replacement,        they    decided      to    rest.\n\nUnfortunately,       Figueroa's        condition     continued      to   deteriorate,\n\nprompting del Carmen Guadalupe to take him to another hospital,\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fRyder Memorial Hospital. Figueroa was pronounced dead upon arrival\n\nat Ryder at 1:45 P.M.     Dr. Yocasta Brugal of the Forensic Sciences\n\nInstitute of Puerto Rico performed an autopsy on Figueroa and\nestablished the cause of death as bilateral bronchial pneumonia.\n\n     Plaintiffs, heirs of Figueroa, filed a complaint against HIMA\n\nand Dr. Samuel Negron Agosto on September 22, 1999, charging them\nwith violations of EMTALA and medical malpractice under Puerto\n\nRican law.     After discovery, HIMA filed a motion for summary\n\njudgment and/or to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs failed to\n\nstate a claim under EMTALA.          HIMA argued that summary judgment was\n\nappropriate because undisputed facts demonstrated that the hospital\n\nhad given Figueroa an appropriate screening examination comparable\n\nto the screening it would have given any patient with substantially\nsimilar symptoms.       It also moved the district court to dismiss\n\nwithout prejudice the malpractice claims.\n\n     To    oppose   the   summary      judgment   motion,    the   plaintiffs\nsubmitted hospital reports, records, and policies, a deposition\n\nfrom del Carmen Guadalupe, and a letter and deposition from their\n\nexpert, Dr. David R. Nateman, Medical Director of the Emergency\n\nServices   Department     of   the    Baptist   Hospital    of   Miami.   Dr.\n\nNateman's report concluded that both the Hospital and Dr. Negron\n\nAgosto\n\n     fell below the standards of medical care for failing to\n     diagnose a life-threatening medical condition which resulted\n     in the death of Narcisco [sic] Figueroa.    In addition, by\n     providing an inadequate medical screening at [the hospital],\n     the patient was not afforded the right of determination of\n     medical stability and therefore was illegally transferred\n     which resulted in a violation of EMTALA.\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f      On June 22, 2001, the district court granted HIMA's motion for\n\nsummary judgment with respect to the plaintiffs' EMTALA claim, and\ndismissed without prejudice their supplemental malpractice claims.\nThe plaintiffs appeal from this decision.\n\n                              II. EMTALA Standards\n\n      The    parties      agree    that   HIMA     provided    Figueroa     with    a\n\nscreening; they disagree over whether it was an \"appropriate\n\nmedical     screening\"     under    the   terms     of   EMTALA.     42    U.S.C.   §\n1395dd(a).        HIMA argues that a plaintiff can prevail under EMTALA\n\nonly if she can demonstrate that the hospital offered no screening\n\nat   all,    or    deviated   from    its       standard   screening      procedures\napplicable to other patients with similar conditions.1                      As HIMA\nputs it     in     its   brief,   \"[w]hat       EMTALA   prohibits   is    disparate\n\nscreening or no screening at all.\"               Although appellants agree with\n\nthe disparate screening standard, they also contend that a hospital\ncan violate EMTALA if its screening is so cursory or inadequate\n\nthat it is tantamount to no medical screening.                     As we explain,\n\nneither party has it exactly right.\n\n\n      1\n       For the sake of convenience, in the remainder of this\nopinion we will refer to HIMA as the only defendant in this case.\nAs a physician, Dr. Negron Agosto may be immune from EMTALA\nliability. While we have \"not decided the issue whether EMTALA\nprovides a cause of action against individual physicians, all\ncircuits that have done so have found that it does not.\" Lebron v.\nAshford Presbyterian Cmty. Hosp., 995 F. Supp. 241, 244 (D.P.R.\n1998) (citing Eberhardt v. City of Los Angeles, 62 F.3d 1253 (9th\nCir. 1995); King v. Ahrens, 16 F.3d 265 (8th Cir. 1994); Delaney\nv. Cade, 986 F.2d 387 (10th Cir. 1993); Baber v. Hosp. Corp. of\nAmerica, 977 F.2d 872 (4th Cir. 1992);      Gatewood v. Washington\nHealthcare Corp., 933 F.2d 1037 (D.C.Cir. 1991)). Since we decide\nthat EMTALA was not violated here, we need not decide the question\nof physician liability in this case.\n\n                                          -5-\n\f      By its terms, EMTALA is designed to assure that any person\n\nvisiting a covered hospital's emergency room is screened for an\nemergency medical condition and is stabilized if such a condition\nexists.2   With respect to screening, it requires the following:\n\n      In the case of a hospital that has a hospital emergency\n      department, if any individual . . . comes to the\n      emergency department and a request is made on the\n      individual's behalf for examination or treatment for a\n      medical condition, the hospital must provide for an\n      appropriate medical screening examination within the\n      capability of the hospital's emergency department,\n      including ancillary services routinely available to the\n      emergency department, to determine whether or not an\n      emergency medical condition (within the meaning of\n      subsection (e)(1) of this section) exists.\n\n42   U.S.C.   §   1395dd(a).    EMTALA          does   not   define    the   term\n\n\"appropriate medical screening examination.\"                 However, it does\n\nindicate that the purpose of the screening is to identify an\n\"emergency medical condition.\"        An emergency medical condition is\n\ndefined as\n\n      a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms\n      of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that\n      the absence of immediate medical attention could\n      reasonably be expected to result in--\n           (i) placing the health of the individual (or, with\n           respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the\n           woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy,\n           (ii) serious impairment to bodily functions, or\n           (iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or\n           part[.]\n\n42   U.S.C.   §   1395dd(e)(1)(A).         To    identify    such     conditions,\nhospitals are expected to employ            \"ancillary services routinely\n\navailable to the emergency department.\"                42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(a).\n\n     2\n       A covered hospital is defined as a \"hospital that has\nentered into a provider agreement under section 1395cc of this\ntitle.\" 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(e)(2). Both sides agree that HIMA is\ncovered by EMTALA.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fHowever, they are not liable for failing to conduct examinations\n\n(or parts thereof) that are not \"within the capability of the\nhospital's emergency department.\"            42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(a).\n       With    the    statutory   language     as    a    guide,    we    have    said\n\npreviously that \"[t]he essence of [EMTALA's] screening requirement\nis   that     there   be   some   screening    procedure,        and     that    it   be\nadministered even-handedly.\"           Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco, 69\n\nF.3d 1184, 1192 (1st Cir. 1995).        Thus, there is both a substantive\nand a procedural component to an appropriate medical screening\nunder EMTALA: \"[a] hospital fulfills its statutory duty to screen\n\npatients in its emergency room if it provides for a screening\n\nexamination reasonably calculated to identify critical medical\n\nconditions that may be afflicting symptomatic patients and provides\nthat   level    of    screening    uniformly    to       all   those     who    present\n\nsubstantially similar complaints.\"            Id.; see also Jackson v. East\n\nBay Hosp., 246 F.3d 1248, 1256 (9th Cir. 2001) (\"We hold that a\nhospital      satisfies     EMTALA's   'appropriate            medical    screening'\n\nrequirement if it provides a patient with an examination comparable\n\nto the one offered to other patients presenting similar symptoms,\n\nunless the examination is so cursory that it is not 'designed to\n\nidentify acute and severe symptoms that alert the physician of the\n\nneed for immediate medical attention to prevent serious bodily\n\ninjury.'\" (quoting Eberhardt v. City of Los Angeles, 62 F.3d 1253,\n\n1257 (9th Cir. 1995))).\n\n\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\f                  III. Applying the Legal Standards\n\nA. Reasonably Calculated to Identify Critical Medical Conditions\n\n     In pressing their claim that HIMA failed to provide Figueroa\n\nwith an appropriate medical screening under the terms of EMTALA,\n\nplaintiffs argued that \"[t]he medical examination and treatment\n\n[offered    to   Figueroa]    .    .    .    was    totally    inadequate   and\n\ninappropriate for a man in his condition.\"                In moving for summary\n\njudgment in response to this claim, HIMA focused on concessions\n\nelicited from the plaintiffs' expert witness, Dr. Nateman, during\n\nhis deposition. Although Dr. Nateman concluded that there had been\nan \"improper screening,\" he also conceded that he could not be\ncertain    whether    Figueroa     suffered        from   a   \"life-threatening\n\ncondition\" when he arrived at HIMA. Dr. Nateman also admitted that\nFigueroa was treated rapidly at the hospital, noting that Figueroa\n\"was triaged, [had] some vital signs done, had a physical exam by\n\nthe doctor, and chest x-rays [and] laboratory tests were ordered.\"\n     Figueroa's      wife,   del    Carmen     Guadalupe,      confirmed    this\ntestimony in her deposition.        She also testified that Figueroa was\n\ngiven medication at the emergency room.              She stated that, at the\nclose of their visit, she was given a prescription and told to come\n\nback in the morning for the x-rays.                Del Carmen Guadalupe also\n\nstated at the deposition that her husband did not appear to be in\n\ncritical condition when he left the hospital with her:\n\n     Q:   [B]y five in the morning . . . your husband was doing well\n     in   the car.\n     A:   Yes.\n     Q:   That is, conscious and talking and all that.\n     A:   Yes.\n\n                                       -8-\n\f     Q.   Did he express any complaints about the way he was attended\n     in   there?\n     A:   No.\n     Q:   Some sort of malcontent?\n     A:   No.\n     Q:   You personally, did you feel you were attended?\n     A:   Yes.\n\nGiven the concessions of Dr. Nateman and del Carmen Guadalupe, HIMA\nargues that it was clear that HIMA's screening of Figueroa was\nreasonably    calculated        to     identify   critical       medical    conditions\nafflicting him.\n     In response, the plaintiffs argue that, while this screening\nexamination     may      have    been    adequate       for    many    emergency     room\n\npatients, it was \"totally inadequate and inappropriate for a man in\n\n[Figueroa's] condition.\"             According to Dr. Nateman, Figueroa's co-\n\nmorbid    conditions--his            obesity,     age    (51),        edematous     legs,\ncatheterization, and high respiration rate--made him a \"vascular\n\nnightmare waiting to happen,\" a man with an obvious \"potential for\n\ndeath.\"      Dr. Nateman concluded that an appropriate screening\nexamination        would        have     included,        at      a      minimum,        an\n\nelectrocardiogram, a fuller assessment of Figueroa's respiratory\n\nfunction,    and    an    immediate      reading    of    the    chest     x-ray    by    a\nradiologist.3       At the very least, say the                    plaintiffs, these\n\n\n\n     3\n       Dr. Nateman's deposition suggests that Figueroa's chest x-\nrays were examined twice--once at about 2:00 A.M. (by the doctor on\ncall), and then again at 11:05 A.M. (by a radiologist).         Dr.\nNateman stated that the doctor on call clearly misdiagnosed\nFigueroa, in part because \"his chest x-rays were not normal.\"\nHowever, Dr. Nateman also admitted that he did not have the x-rays\nwith him at the deposition, and therefore could not answer an\nattorney's question as to whether \"the reading by the emergency\nroom doctor [was] obviously wrong, or . . . [was] reasonably\nmisread [by a non-radiologist].\"\n\n                                          -9-\n\fcontentions created a \"genuine issue of material fact\" regarding\n\nthe    appropriateness    of     the    screening    examination       offered   to\nFigueroa.\n        Although plaintiffs' arguments have some force, they ignore\n\nthe important distinction between an EMTALA claim and a malpractice\nclaim.     EMTALA does not \"create a cause of action for medical\nmalpractice,\"      and        \"faulty      screening,      in      a   particular\ncase . . . does not contravene the statute. \"                Correa, 69 F.3d at\n\n1192-93.    Dr. Nateman's criticisms of HIMA's diagnosis of Figueroa\nin the emergency room are indistinguishable from the standard of\n\ncare criticisms that one would hear from an expert in a malpractice\n\ncase triggered by a misdiagnosis.               Under EMTALA the issue is not\n\nwhat     deficiencies    in     the     standard    of    emergency    room    care\ncontributed to a misdiagnosis.                See Gatewood, 933 F.2d at 1041\n\n(observing that EMTALA is not intended \"to ensure each emergency\n\nroom patient a correct diagnosis\").              Rather, the issue is whether\nthe procedures     followed      in     the   emergency    room,   even   if   they\n\nresulted in a misdiagnosis, were reasonably calculated to identify\n\nthe patient’s critical medical condition. Dr. Nateman's criticisms\n\ndo not address this precisely formulated EMTALA standard.\n\n       Moreover, whereas malpractice liability usually attaches when\n\na health care provider fails to adhere to a \"general professional\n\nstandard\" of care, W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the\n\nLaw of Torts § 32, at 188 (1984), EMTALA only requires \"an\n\nappropriate medical screening examination within the capability of\n\n\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fthe hospital's emergency department.\"    42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(a).   As\n\nthe Fourth Circuit has observed:\n     This section establishes a standard which will of\n     necessity be individualized for each hospital, since\n     hospital emergency departments have varying capabilities.\n     Had Congress intended to require hospitals to provide a\n     screening examination which comported with generally\n     accepted medical standards, it could have clearly\n     specified a national standard.        Nor do we believe\n     Congress intended to create a negligence standard based\n     on each hospital's capability. EMTALA is no substitute\n     for state law medical malpractice actions.\nBaber, 977 F.2d at 879-80.     Although Dr. Nateman criticized HIMA\nfor failing to perform certain tests for Figueroa, plaintiffs\n\noffered no evidence indicating that such tests were within HIMA's\n\ncapability.   For example, Dr. Nateman stated during his deposition\nthat, at his hospital, he would test \"oxygen saturation [for]\n\nanybody who comes in with any kind of respiratory complaints.\"\n\nHowever, he also admitted that he did not know \"if [HIMA has] the\nmachine necessary for such a test.\"     Dr. Nateman suggested that\n\nHIMA should have had a radiologist examine Figueroa's x-rays as\n\nsoon as they were developed.   However, he also said that he had \"no\nidea\" whether the hospital's radiology department was in full\n\noperation at that time.   Plaintiffs offered no evidence that HIMA\n\nhad an electrocardiogram machine available, or had staff on hand\n\nqualified to perform a \"respiratory differential\"--two other items\nDr. Nateman deemed essential to an \"appropriate medical screening\n\nexamination.\"   A claim of inappropriate medical screening based on\n\na failure to provide certain diagnostic tests must at least address\nwhether the hospital was capable of performing such tests. Because\n\nplaintiffs failed to present such evidence or evidence that HIMA's\n\n                                -11-\n\fscreening was not \"reasonably calculated to identify critical\n\nmedical conditions,\" Correa, 69 F.3d at 1192, summary judgment for\nHIMA on the substantive component of EMTALA was appropriate.\n\n\n\nB. Disparate Treatment\n\n      The district court concluded that the plaintiffs’ failure to\n\n\"submit any . . . policies on the initial screening standards of\n\nDefendant HIMA\" was \"a fatal flaw in their case.\"                 Without that\nevidence, the district court concluded, the plaintiffs could not\n\ndemonstrate that HIMA gave Figueroa a more cursory screening than\n\nit gave to other patients with substantially similar symptoms.\nAlthough we affirm the decision to grant summary judgment on the\ndisparate    treatment    claim,      we    do   not   agree   that    the   claim\n\nnecessarily failed because the plaintiffs did not submit the\n\nscreening policies of HIMA.                Although they are effective for\ndemonstrating      disparate   treatment,        written    hospital   screening\n\npolicies may not exist, and therefore cannot be necessary to a\n\ndisparate treatment determination.4\n      Moreover, \"'we may affirm [a summary judgment] order on any\n\nground revealed by the record.'\" McGurn v. Bell Microproducts,\n\n284   F.3d   86,   91   (1st   Cir.    2002)     (quoting    Houlton   Citizens'\n\nCoalition v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir. 1999)).\n\n\n      4\n        If evidence of such written screening policies were\nindispensable to EMTALA liability, a hospital could avoid liability\nsimply by failing to generate them. A \"hospital cannot simply hide\nbehind [a] lack of standard emergency room procedures.\" Power v.\nArlington Hosp. Assoc., 42 F.3d 851, 858 (4th Cir. 1994) (internal\nquotation marks omitted).\n\n                                      -12-\n\fPlaintiffs failed to submit any evidence establishing that HIMA\n\ntreated Figueroa any differently than it treated other patients\nwith substantially similar symptoms.        HIMA submitted an affidavit\nfrom its president, Carlos Pineiro Crespo, stating that \"there were\n\nno deviations on Mr. Figueroa's case from the standard treatment\nHIMA offers persons in Mr. Figueroa's condition.\"               The plaintiffs\ncannot contradict this assertion because they have not addressed\nthe baseline level of screening prevailing at HIMA.                     At his\ndeposition, Dr. Nateman was asked whether \"there was [sic] any\ndeviations of the standard treatment that [HIMA] gives to people in\n\nthe condition of Mr. Figueroa,\" and he replied \"I can't comment on\n\nthat.     I'm not sure.\"    The plaintiffs made no effort to compare\n\nFigueroa's    screening    with   screenings    of     other    HIMA   patients\nsuffering from substantially similar symptoms.             By submitting no\n\ntestimony    regarding    the   baseline   of   care    which    the   hospital\n\nprovides, the plaintiffs failed to raise a genuine question of\nmaterial fact on the issue of differential treatment.\n\n        The plaintiffs argue that the hospital may not have revealed\n\nits screening procedures during discovery, and that subsequent\nfact-finding might reveal this crucial evidence.               They claim that\n\n\"[w]hen Defendants control the information, in essence controlling\n\nthe keys to the dismissal, the dismissal should not be granted,\"\n\nOrtiz v. Mennonite Gen. Hosp., 106 F. Supp. 2d 327, 331 (D.P.R.\n\n2000).     However, in Ortiz, the hospital clearly gave evasive\n\nanswers to interrogatories--something the plaintiffs here do not\n\nallege.     Id.   Moreover, while they now imply that HIMA may be\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fconcealing the relevant documents, the plaintiffs assured the\n\ndistrict court on October 27, 2000, that \"Defendant HIMA-Humacao\nhas answered all discovery submitted by the plaintiffs.\" Given\ntheir failure to press for the relevant documentation at that\n\ntime, they cannot now claim that the mere allegation of disparate\ntreatment raises a genuine issue of material fact over whether\ndisparate     treatment     actually   occurred.        \"A   genuine     issue   of\nmaterial fact does not spring into being simply because a litigant\nclaims that one exists [or] 'promise[s] to produce admissible\nevidence at trial.'\"        Griggs, 904 F.2d at 115 (quoting Garside v.\n\nOsco Drug, Inc., 895 F.2d 46, 49 (1st Cir. 1990)).\n\n                              IV. Stabilization\n\n     In   addition     to   a   medical    screening     requirement,      EMTALA\n\nmandates that hospitals stabilize patients with emergency medical\n\nconditions before releasing them.                See 42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(b)\n\n(requiring \"stabilizing treatment for emergency medical conditions\n\nand labor\").     In a footnote at the conclusion of their brief, the\n\nplaintiffs claim that, although they charged HIMA with violating\nthe stabilization requirement in their complaint, \"the district\n\ncourt   did   not   address     [whether      HIMA   complied    with]   EMTALA's\nstabilization requirement.\"            However, the district court did\n\nexplain why the stabilization requirement does not apply to this\ncase: \"If no emergency condition is detected, there is no duty to\nstabilize.\"     The district court's inquiry properly ended after it\n\ndetermined that Figueroa's screening was neither inadequate nor\ninequitable,     and   that     the    screening      revealed    no     emergency\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\fcondition.     A   hospital    is   only   \"required   to   stabilize\"   an\n\nindividual if \"the hospital determines that the individual has an\nemergency medical condition.\"          42 U.S.C. § 1395dd(b)(1).         The\ndistrict court correctly applied the statute to this case.\n\n                              V.    Conclusion\n\n     For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the district court\n\nis affirmed.   Each side shall bear its own costs.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -15-\n\f",

EMTALA requires hospitals to provide emergency room patients with an appropriate medical screening designed to identify emergency conditions. Contending that Hospital Interamericano de Medicina Avanzada, Inc.-Humacao (HIMA) provided such a minimal screening for Narciso Figueroa that it could not be deemed appropriate, the plaintiffs appeal the district court's grant of summary judgment to HIMA. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reviewing an award of summary judgment, we \"view the entire record in the light most hospitable to the party opposing summary judgment, indulging all reasonable inferences in that party's favor.\" <i>Griggs-Ryan v. Smith,</i> 904 F.2d 112, 115 (1st Cir.1990). We state the facts accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 2, 1998, at approximately 9:50 P.M., Maria del Carmen Guadalupe took her husband, Narciso Figueroa, to the Yabucoa Diagnostic and Treatment Center (YDTC). Figueroa was suffering from urinary retention, edema in his legs, high blood pressure, and pain. The YDTC referred Figueroa to HIMA, where he arrived at 1:05 A.M. on October 3, 1998, accompanied by del Carmen Guadalupe. By this time, Figueroa was also suffering from increased respiratory difficulty, a dry cough, fever, and drowsiness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When he arrived at HIMA, Figueroa was joined by his niece, a nurse who worked at the hospital (but was off duty at the time). She spoke to the doctor on call, Dr. Samuel Negron Agosto. While del Carmen Guadalupe filled out paperwork at the front desk of the hospital, Dr. Negron Agosto examined Figueroa. Although there were other patients in the emergency room, Figueroa was examined before them. At least two nurses also attended to Figueroa, taking his vital signs, drawing blood, and arranging for an x-ray of his chest. The nurses also checked the Foley catheter (designed to drain urine) that had been attached to Figueroa before he arrived. Figueroa was conscious the whole time, communicating to family members and health care workers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing an x-ray, Dr. Negron Agosto diagnosed Figueroa with bronchial pneumonia. In her deposition, del Carmen Guadalupe claimed that Dr. Negron Agosto told Figueroa's niece (the nurse) that Figueroa could be discharged because \"nobody dies from [bronchial pneumonia].\" Before del Carmen Guadalupe left with Figueroa, Dr. Negron Agosto gave her some medicine and told her to give it to Figueroa once they got home and to return to the hospital the next day to pick up the x-ray. Figueroa was discharged at about 3:00 A.M., and del Carmen Guadalupe drove him back home by 5:00 A.M. He was conscious and speaking during the journey, and did not complain about his treatment at the hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After del Carmen Guadalupe and Figueroa returned to their home, they looked for the medicine, but could not find it. Rather than returning for a replacement, they decided to rest. Unfortunately, Figueroa's condition continued to deteriorate, prompting del Carmen Guadalupe to take him to another hospital, Ryder Memorial Hospital. Figueroa was pronounced dead upon arrival at Ryder at 1:45 P.M. Dr. Yocasta Brugal of the Forensic Sciences Institute of Puerto Rico performed an autopsy on Figueroa and established the cause of death as bilateral bronchial pneumonia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs, heirs of Figueroa, filed a complaint against HIMA and Dr. Samuel Negron Agosto on September 22, 1999, charging them with violations of EMTALA and medical malpractice under Puerto Rican law. After discovery, HIMA filed a motion for summary judgment and/or to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim under EMTALA. HIMA argued that summary judgment was appropriate because undisputed facts demonstrated that the hospital had given Figueroa an appropriate screening examination comparable to the screening it would have given any patient with substantially similar symptoms. It also moved the district court to dismiss without prejudice the malpractice claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To oppose the summary judgment motion, the plaintiffs submitted hospital reports, records, and policies, a deposition from del Carmen Guadalupe, and a letter and deposition from their expert, Dr. David R. Nateman, Medical Director of the Emergency Services Department of the Baptist Hospital of Miami. Dr. Nateman's report concluded that both the Hospital and Dr. Negron Agosto</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">fell below the standards of medical care for failing to diagnose a life-threatening medical condition which resulted in the death of Narcisco [sic] Figueroa. In addition, by providing an inadequate medical screening at [the hospital], the patient was not afforded the right of determination of medical stability and therefore was illegally transferred which resulted in a violation of EMTALA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 22, 2001, the district court granted HIMA's motion for summary judgment with respect to the plaintiffs' EMTALA claim, and dismissed without prejudice their supplemental malpractice claims. The plaintiffs appeal from this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. EMTALA Standards</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that HIMA provided Figueroa with a screening; they disagree over whether it was an \"appropriate medical screening\" under the terms of EMTALA. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(a). HIMA argues that a plaintiff can prevail under EMTALA only if she can demonstrate that the hospital offered no screening at all, or deviated from its standard screening procedures applicable to other patients with similar conditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> As HIMA puts it in its brief, \"[w]hat EMTALA prohibits is disparate screening or no screening at all.\" Although appellants agree with the disparate screening standard, they also contend that a hospital can violate EMTALA if its screening is so cursory or inadequate that it is tantamount to no medical screening. As we explain, neither party has it exactly right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, EMTALA is designed to assure that any person visiting a covered hospital's emergency room is screened for an emergency medical condition and is stabilized if such a condition exists.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> With respect to screening, it requires the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of a hospital that has a hospital emergency department, if any individual ... comes to the emergency department and a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, the hospital must provide for an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital's emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition (within the meaning of subsection (e)(1) of this section) exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(a). EMTALA does not define the term \"appropriate medical screening examination.\" However, it does indicate that the purpose of the screening is to identify an \"emergency medical condition.\" An emergency medical condition is defined as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) serious impairment to bodily functions, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(e)(1)(A). To identify such conditions, hospitals are expected to employ \"ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(a). However, they are not liable for failing to conduct examinations (or parts thereof) that are not \"within the capability of the hospital's emergency department.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the statutory language as a guide, we have said previously that \"[t]he essence of [EMTALA's] screening requirement is that there be some screening procedure, and that it be administered even-handedly.\" <i>Correa v. Hosp. San Francisco,</i> 69 F.3d 1184, 1192 (1st Cir.1995). Thus, there is both a substantive and a procedural component to an appropriate medical screening under EMTALA: \"[a] hospital fulfills its statutory duty to screen patients in its emergency room if it provides for a screening examination reasonably calculated to identify critical medical conditions that may be afflicting symptomatic patients and provides that level of screening uniformly to all those who present substantially similar complaints.\" <i>Id.; see also Jackson v. East Bay Hosp.,</i> 246 F.3d 1248, 1256 (9th Cir.2001) (\"We hold that a hospital satisfies EMTALA's `appropriate medical screening' requirement if it provides a patient with an examination comparable to the one offered to other patients presenting similar symptoms, unless the examination is so cursory that it is not `designed to identify acute and severe symptoms that alert the physician of the need for immediate medical attention to prevent serious bodily injury.'\" (quoting <i>Eberhardt v. City of Los Angeles,</i> 62 F.3d 1253, 1257 (9th Cir.1995))).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III. Applying the Legal Standards</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. Reasonably Calculated to Identify Critical Medical Conditions</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In pressing their claim that HIMA failed to provide Figueroa with an appropriate medical screening under the terms of EMTALA, plaintiffs argued that \"[t]he medical examination and treatment [offered to Figueroa] ... was totally inadequate and inappropriate for a man in his condition.\" In moving for summary judgment in response to this claim, HIMA focused on concessions elicited from the plaintiffs' expert witness, Dr. Nateman, during his deposition. Although Dr. Nateman concluded that there had been an \"improper screening,\" he also conceded that he could not be certain whether Figueroa suffered from a \"life-threatening condition\" when he arrived at HIMA. Dr. Nateman also admitted that Figueroa was treated rapidly at the hospital, noting that Figueroa \"was triaged, [had] some vital signs done, had a physical exam by the doctor, and chest x-rays [and] laboratory tests were ordered.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa's wife, del Carmen Guadalupe, confirmed this testimony in her deposition. She also testified that Figueroa was given medication at the emergency room. She stated that, at the close of their visit, she was given a prescription and told to come back in the morning for the x-rays. Del Carmen Guadalupe also stated at the deposition that her husband did not appear to be in critical condition when he left the hospital with her:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: [B]y five in the morning ... your husband was doing well in the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: That is, conscious and talking and all that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q.

EMTALA does not \"create a cause of action for medical malpractice,\" and \"faulty screening, in a particular case ... does not contravene the statute.\" <i>Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1192-93. Dr. Nateman's criticisms of HIMA's diagnosis of Figueroa in the emergency room are indistinguishable from the standard of care criticisms that one would hear from an expert in a malpractice case triggered by a misdiagnosis. Under EMTALA the issue is not what deficiencies in the standard of emergency room care contributed to a misdiagnosis. <i>See Gatewood,</i> 933 F.2d at 1041 (observing that EMTALA is not intended \"to ensure each emergency room patient a correct diagnosis\"). Rather, the issue is whether the procedures followed in the emergency room, even if they resulted in a misdiagnosis, were reasonably calculated to identify the patient's critical medical condition. Dr. Nateman's criticisms do not address this precisely formulated EMTALA standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, whereas malpractice liability usually attaches when a health care provider fails to adhere to a \"general professional standard\" of care, W. Page Keeton et al., <i>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts</i> &#167; 32, at 188 (1984), EMTALA only requires \"an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital's emergency department.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(a). As the Fourth Circuit has observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This section establishes a standard which will of necessity be individualized for each hospital, since hospital emergency departments have varying capabilities. Had Congress intended to require hospitals to provide a screening examination which comported with generally accepted medical standards, it could have clearly specified a national standard. Nor do we believe Congress intended to create a negligence standard based on each hospital's capability. EMTALA is no substitute for state law medical malpractice actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Baber,</i> 977 F.2d at 879-80. Although Dr. Nateman criticized HIMA for failing to perform certain tests for Figueroa, plaintiffs offered no evidence indicating that such tests were within HIMA's capability. For example, Dr. Nateman stated during his deposition that, at his hospital, he would test \"oxygen saturation [for] anybody who comes in with any kind of respiratory complaints.\" However, he also admitted that he did not know \"if [HIMA has] the machine necessary for such a test.\" Dr. Nateman suggested that HIMA should have had a radiologist examine Figueroa's x-rays as soon as they were developed. However, he also said that he had \"no idea\" whether the hospital's radiology department was in full operation at that time. Plaintiffs offered no evidence that HIMA had an electrocardiogram machine available, or had staff on hand qualified to perform a \"respiratory differential\" &#8212; two other items Dr. Nateman deemed essential to an \"appropriate medical screening examination.\" A claim of inappropriate medical screening based on a failure to provide certain diagnostic tests must at least address whether the hospital was capable of performing such tests. Because plaintiffs failed to present such evidence or evidence that HIMA's screening was not \"reasonably calculated to identify critical medical conditions,\" <i>Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1192, summary judgment for HIMA on the substantive component of EMTALA was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Disparate Treatment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that the plaintiffs' failure to \"submit any ... policies on the initial screening standards of Defendant HIMA\" was \"a fatal flaw in their case.\" Without that evidence, the district court concluded, the plaintiffs could not demonstrate that HIMA gave Figueroa a more cursory screening than it gave to other patients with substantially similar symptoms. Although we affirm the decision to grant summary judgment on the disparate treatment claim, we do not agree that the claim necessarily failed because the plaintiffs did not submit the screening policies of HIMA. Although they are effective for demonstrating disparate treatment, written hospital screening policies may not exist, and therefore cannot be necessary to a disparate treatment determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, \"`we may affirm [a summary judgment] order on any ground revealed by the record.'\" <i>McGurn v. Bel-Microproducts,</i> 284 F.3d 86, 91 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>Houlton Citizens' Coalition v. Town of Houlton,</i> 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir.1999)). Plaintiffs failed to submit any evidence establishing that HIMA treated Figueroa any differently than it treated other patients with substantially similar symptoms. HIMA submitted an affidavit from its president, Carlos Pineiro Crespo, stating that \"there were no deviations on Mr. Figueroa's case from the standard treatment HIMA offers persons in Mr. Figueroa's condition.\" The plaintiffs cannot contradict this assertion because they have not addressed the baseline level of screening prevailing at HIMA. At his deposition, Dr. Nateman was asked whether \"there was [sic] any deviations of the standard treatment that [HIMA] gives to people in the condition of Mr. Figueroa,\" and he replied \"I can't comment on that. I'm not sure.\" The plaintiffs made no effort to compare Figueroa's screening with screenings of other HIMA patients suffering from substantially similar symptoms. By submitting no testimony regarding the baseline of care which the hospital provides, the plaintiffs failed to raise a genuine question of material fact on the issue of differential treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue that the hospital may not have revealed its screening procedures during discovery, and that subsequent fact-finding might reveal this crucial evidence. They claim that \"[w]hen Defendants control the information, in essence controlling the keys to the dismissal, the dismissal should not be granted,\" <i>Ortiz v. Mennonite Gen. Hosp.,</i> 106 F.Supp.2d 327, 331 (D.P.R.2000). However, in <i>Ortiz,</i> the hospital clearly gave evasive answers to interrogatories &#8212; something the plaintiffs here do not allege. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, while they now imply that HIMA may be concealing the relevant documents, the plaintiffs assured the district court on October 27, 2000, that \"Defendant HIMA-Humacao has answered all discovery submitted by the plaintiffs.\" Given their failure to press for the relevant documentation at that time, they cannot now claim that the mere allegation of disparate treatment raises a genuine issue of material fact over whether disparate treatment actually occurred. \"A genuine issue of material fact does not spring into being simply because a litigant claims that one exists [or] `promise[s] to produce admissible evidence at trial.'\" <i>Griggs,</i> 904 F.2d at 115 (quoting <i>Garside v.

Stabilization</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to a medical screening requirement, EMTALA mandates that hospitals stabilize patients with emergency medical conditions before releasing them. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(b) (requiring \"stabilizing treatment for emergency medical conditions and labor\"). In a footnote at the conclusion of their brief, the plaintiffs claim that, although they charged HIMA with violating the stabilization requirement in their complaint, \"the district court did not address [whether HIMA complied with] EMTALA's stabilization requirement.\" However, the district court did explain why the stabilization requirement does not apply to this case: \"If no emergency condition is detected, there is no duty to stabilize.\" The district court's inquiry properly ended after it determined that Figueroa's screening was neither inadequate nor inequitable, and that the screening revealed no emergency condition. A hospital is only \"required to stabilize\" an individual if \"the hospital determines that the individual has an emergency medical condition.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(b)(1). The district court correctly applied the statute to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.

EMTALA requires hospitals to provide emergency room patients with an appropriate medical screening designed to identify emergency conditions. Contending that Hospital Interamericano de Medicina Avanzada, Inc.-Humacao (HIMA) provided such a minimal screening for Narciso Figueroa that it could not be deemed appropriate, the plaintiffs appeal the district court's grant of summary judgment to HIMA.

We state the facts accordingly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 2, 1998, at approximately 9:50 P.M., Maria del Carmen Guadalupe took her husband, Narciso Figueroa, to the Yabucoa Diagnostic and Treatment Center (YDTC). Figueroa was suffering from urinary retention, edema in his legs, high blood pressure, and pain. The YDTC referred Figueroa to HIMA, where he arrived at 1:05 A.M. on October 3, 1998, accompanied by del Carmen Guadalupe. By this time, Figueroa was also suffering from increased respiratory difficulty, a dry cough, fever, and drowsiness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When he arrived at HIMA, Figueroa was joined by his niece, a nurse who worked at the hospital (but was off duty at the time). She spoke to the doctor on call, Dr. Samuel Negron Agosto. While del Carmen Guadalupe filled out paperwork at the front desk of the hospital, Dr. Negron Agosto examined Figueroa. Although there were other patients in the emergency room, Figueroa was examined before them. At least two nurses also attended to Figueroa, taking his vital signs, drawing blood, and arranging for an x-ray of his chest. The nurses also checked the Foley catheter (designed to drain urine) that had been attached to Figueroa before he arrived. Figueroa was conscious the whole time, communicating to family members and health care workers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing an x-ray, Dr. Negron Agosto diagnosed Figueroa with bronchial pneumonia. In her deposition, del Carmen Guadalupe claimed that Dr. Negron Agosto told Figueroa's niece (the nurse) that Figueroa could be discharged because \"nobody dies from [bronchial pneumonia].\" Before del Carmen Guadalupe left with Figueroa, Dr. Negron Agosto gave her some medicine and told her to give it to Figueroa once they got home and to return to the hospital the next day to pick up the x-ray. Figueroa was discharged at about 3:00 A.M., and del Carmen Guadalupe drove him back home by 5:00 A.M. He was conscious and speaking during the journey, and did not complain about his treatment at the hospital.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After del Carmen Guadalupe and Figueroa returned to their home, they looked for the medicine, but could not find it. Rather than returning for a replacement, they decided to rest. Unfortunately, Figueroa's condition continued to deteriorate, prompting del Carmen Guadalupe to take him to another hospital, Ryder Memorial Hospital. Figueroa was pronounced dead upon arrival at Ryder at 1:45 P.M. Dr. Yocasta Brugal of the Forensic Sciences Institute of Puerto Rico performed an autopsy on Figueroa and established the cause of death as bilateral bronchial pneumonia.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Plaintiffs, heirs of Figueroa, filed a complaint against HIMA and Dr. Samuel Negron Agosto on September 22, 1999, charging them with violations of EMTALA and medical malpractice under Puerto Rican law. After discovery, HIMA filed a motion for summary judgment and/or to dismiss, arguing that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim under EMTALA. HIMA argued that summary judgment was appropriate because undisputed facts demonstrated that the hospital had given Figueroa an appropriate screening examination comparable to the screening it would have given any patient with substantially similar symptoms. It also moved the district court to dismiss without prejudice the malpractice claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To oppose the summary judgment motion, the plaintiffs submitted hospital reports, records, and policies, a deposition from del Carmen Guadalupe, and a letter and deposition from their expert, Dr. David R. Nateman, Medical Director of the Emergency Services Department of the Baptist Hospital of Miami. Dr. Nateman's report concluded that both the Hospital and Dr. Negron Agosto</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">fell below the standards of medical care for failing to diagnose a life-threatening medical condition which resulted in the death of Narcisco [sic] Figueroa. In addition, by providing an inadequate medical screening at [the hospital], the patient was not afforded the right of determination of medical stability and therefore was illegally transferred which resulted in a violation of EMTALA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 22, 2001, the district court granted HIMA's motion for summary judgment with respect to the plaintiffs' EMTALA claim, and dismissed without prejudice their supplemental malpractice claims. The plaintiffs appeal from this decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. EMTALA Standards</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties agree that HIMA provided Figueroa with a screening; they disagree over whether it was an \"appropriate medical screening\" under the terms of EMTALA. 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(a). HIMA argues that a plaintiff can prevail under EMTALA only if she can demonstrate that the hospital offered no screening at all, or deviated from its standard screening procedures applicable to other patients with similar conditions.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> As HIMA puts it in its brief, \"[w]hat EMTALA prohibits is disparate screening or no screening at all.\" Although appellants agree with the disparate screening standard, they also contend that a hospital can violate EMTALA if its screening is so cursory or inadequate that it is tantamount to no medical screening. As we explain, neither party has it exactly right.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By its terms, EMTALA is designed to assure that any person visiting a covered hospital's emergency room is screened for an emergency medical condition and is stabilized if such a condition exists.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> With respect to screening, it requires the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the case of a hospital that has a hospital emergency department, if any individual ... comes to the emergency department and a request is made on the individual's behalf for examination or treatment for a medical condition, the hospital must provide for an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital's emergency department, including ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department, to determine whether or not an emergency medical condition (within the meaning of subsection (e)(1) of this section) exists.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(a). EMTALA does not define the term \"appropriate medical screening examination.\" However, it does indicate that the purpose of the screening is to identify an \"emergency medical condition.\" An emergency medical condition is defined as</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a medical condition manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(ii) serious impairment to bodily functions, or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(iii) serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part[.]</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(e)(1)(A). To identify such conditions, hospitals are expected to employ \"ancillary services routinely available to the emergency department.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(a). However, they are not liable for failing to conduct examinations (or parts thereof) that are not \"within the capability of the hospital's emergency department.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">With the statutory language as a guide, we have said previously that \"[t]he essence of [EMTALA's] screening requirement is that there be some screening procedure, and that it be administered even-handedly.\" <i>Correa v.

Thus, there is both a substantive and a procedural component to an appropriate medical screening under EMTALA: \"[a] hospital fulfills its statutory duty to screen patients in its emergency room if it provides for a screening examination reasonably calculated to identify critical medical conditions that may be afflicting symptomatic patients and provides that level of screening uniformly to all those who present substantially similar complaints.\" <i>Id.; see also Jackson v.

Although Dr. Nateman concluded that there had been an \"improper screening,\" he also conceded that he could not be certain whether Figueroa suffered from a \"life-threatening condition\" when he arrived at HIMA. Dr. Nateman also admitted that Figueroa was treated rapidly at the hospital, noting that Figueroa \"was triaged, [had] some vital signs done, had a physical exam by the doctor, and chest x-rays [and] laboratory tests were ordered.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Figueroa's wife, del Carmen Guadalupe, confirmed this testimony in her deposition. She also testified that Figueroa was given medication at the emergency room. She stated that, at the close of their visit, she was given a prescription and told to come back in the morning for the x-rays. Del Carmen Guadalupe also stated at the deposition that her husband did not appear to be in critical condition when he left the hospital with her:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: [B]y five in the morning ... your husband was doing well in the car.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q: That is, conscious and talking and all that.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A: Yes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q.

EMTALA does not \"create a cause of action for medical malpractice,\" and \"faulty screening, in a particular case ... does not contravene the statute.\" <i>Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1192-93. Dr. Nateman's criticisms of HIMA's diagnosis of Figueroa in the emergency room are indistinguishable from the standard of care criticisms that one would hear from an expert in a malpractice case triggered by a misdiagnosis. Under EMTALA the issue is not what deficiencies in the standard of emergency room care contributed to a misdiagnosis. <i>See Gatewood,</i> 933 F.2d at 1041 (observing that EMTALA is not intended \"to ensure each emergency room patient a correct diagnosis\"). Rather, the issue is whether the procedures followed in the emergency room, even if they resulted in a misdiagnosis, were reasonably calculated to identify the patient's critical medical condition. Dr. Nateman's criticisms do not address this precisely formulated EMTALA standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, whereas malpractice liability usually attaches when a health care provider fails to adhere to a \"general professional standard\" of care, W. Page Keeton et al., <i>Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts</i> &#167; 32, at 188 (1984), EMTALA only requires \"an appropriate medical screening examination within the capability of the hospital's emergency department.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(a). As the Fourth Circuit has observed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This section establishes a standard which will of necessity be individualized for each hospital, since hospital emergency departments have varying capabilities. Had Congress intended to require hospitals to provide a screening examination which comported with generally accepted medical standards, it could have clearly specified a national standard. Nor do we believe Congress intended to create a negligence standard based on each hospital's capability. EMTALA is no substitute for state law medical malpractice actions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Baber,</i> 977 F.2d at 879-80. Although Dr. Nateman criticized HIMA for failing to perform certain tests for Figueroa, plaintiffs offered no evidence indicating that such tests were within HIMA's capability. For example, Dr. Nateman stated during his deposition that, at his hospital, he would test \"oxygen saturation [for] anybody who comes in with any kind of respiratory complaints.\" However, he also admitted that he did not know \"if [HIMA has] the machine necessary for such a test.\" Dr. Nateman suggested that HIMA should have had a radiologist examine Figueroa's x-rays as soon as they were developed. However, he also said that he had \"no idea\" whether the hospital's radiology department was in full operation at that time. Plaintiffs offered no evidence that HIMA had an electrocardiogram machine available, or had staff on hand qualified to perform a \"respiratory differential\" &#8212; two other items Dr. Nateman deemed essential to an \"appropriate medical screening examination.\" A claim of inappropriate medical screening based on a failure to provide certain diagnostic tests must at least address whether the hospital was capable of performing such tests. Because plaintiffs failed to present such evidence or evidence that HIMA's screening was not \"reasonably calculated to identify critical medical conditions,\" <i>Correa,</i> 69 F.3d at 1192, summary judgment for HIMA on the substantive component of EMTALA was appropriate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Disparate Treatment</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court concluded that the plaintiffs' failure to \"submit any ... policies on the initial screening standards of Defendant HIMA\" was \"a fatal flaw in their case.\" Without that evidence, the district court concluded, the plaintiffs could not demonstrate that HIMA gave Figueroa a more cursory screening than it gave to other patients with substantially similar symptoms. Although we affirm the decision to grant summary judgment on the disparate treatment claim, we do not agree that the claim necessarily failed because the plaintiffs did not submit the screening policies of HIMA. Although they are effective for demonstrating disparate treatment, written hospital screening policies may not exist, and therefore cannot be necessary to a disparate treatment determination.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, \"`we may affirm [a summary judgment] order on any ground revealed by the record.'\" <i>McGurn v.

Plaintiffs failed to submit any evidence establishing that HIMA treated Figueroa any differently than it treated other patients with substantially similar symptoms. HIMA submitted an affidavit from its president, Carlos Pineiro Crespo, stating that \"there were no deviations on Mr. Figueroa's case from the standard treatment HIMA offers persons in Mr. Figueroa's condition.\" The plaintiffs cannot contradict this assertion because they have not addressed the baseline level of screening prevailing at HIMA. At his deposition, Dr. Nateman was asked whether \"there was [sic] any deviations of the standard treatment that [HIMA] gives to people in the condition of Mr. Figueroa,\" and he replied \"I can't comment on that. I'm not sure.\" The plaintiffs made no effort to compare Figueroa's screening with screenings of other HIMA patients suffering from substantially similar symptoms. By submitting no testimony regarding the baseline of care which the hospital provides, the plaintiffs failed to raise a genuine question of material fact on the issue of differential treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The plaintiffs argue that the hospital may not have revealed its screening procedures during discovery, and that subsequent fact-finding might reveal this crucial evidence. They claim that \"[w]hen Defendants control the information, in essence controlling the keys to the dismissal, the dismissal should not be granted,\" <i>Ortiz v. Mennonite Gen. Hosp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2510728\"><a href=\"/opinion/2510728/fuentes-ortiz-v-mennonite-general-hosp/\"><span class=\"volume\">106</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">327</span></a></span>, 331 (D.P.R.2000). However, in <i>Ortiz,</i> the hospital clearly gave evasive answers to interrogatories &#8212; something the plaintiffs here do not allege. <i>Id.</i> Moreover, while they now imply that HIMA may be concealing the relevant documents, the plaintiffs assured the district court on October 27, 2000, that \"Defendant HIMA-Humacao has answered all discovery submitted by the plaintiffs.\" Given their failure to press for the relevant documentation at that time, they cannot now claim that the mere allegation of disparate treatment raises a genuine issue of material fact over whether disparate treatment actually occurred. \"A genuine issue of material fact does not spring into being simply because a litigant claims that one exists [or] `promise[s] to produce admissible evidence at trial.'\" <i>Griggs,</i> 904 F.2d at 115 (quoting <i>Garside v.

Stabilization</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to a medical screening requirement, EMTALA mandates that hospitals stabilize patients with emergency medical conditions before releasing them. <i>See</i> 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(b) (requiring \"stabilizing treatment for emergency medical conditions and labor\"). In a footnote at the conclusion of their brief, the plaintiffs claim that, although they charged HIMA with violating the stabilization requirement in their complaint, \"the district court did not address [whether HIMA complied with] EMTALA's stabilization requirement.\" However, the district court did explain why the stabilization requirement does not apply to this case: \"If no emergency condition is detected, there is no duty to stabilize.\" The district court's inquiry properly ended after it determined that Figueroa's screening was neither inadequate nor inequitable, and that the screening revealed no emergency condition. A hospital is only \"required to stabilize\" an individual if \"the hospital determines that the individual has an emergency medical condition.\" 42 U.S.C. &#167; 1395dd(b)(1). The district court correctly applied the statute to this case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.
