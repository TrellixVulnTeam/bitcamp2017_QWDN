D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                  Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                Selya, and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Robert C. Andrews, on brief for defendant, appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, and Paula D. Silsby,\nUnited States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n\n                            August 21, 2006\n\f           Per Curiam.     Defendant Aman Taffere (\"Taffere\") appeals\n\nfrom his within-guidelines sentence on the sole ground that the\n\ndistrict court erred in failing to consider the 100:1 crack/cocaine\n\nratio as imposing more punishment than necessary.         The disposition\n\nof this appeal is governed by this court's decisions in United\n\nStates v. Pho, 433 F.3d 53 (1st Cir. 2006), and United States v.\n\nNavedo-Concepción, 450 F.3d 54 (1st Cir. 2006), both of which post-\n\ndated Taffere's sentencing.\n\n           Taffere attempts to avoid Pho's holding that a sentencing\n\ncourt may not categorically substitute a 20:1 crack-to-powder\n\ncocaine ratio for the 100:1 ratio provided in the guidelines, Pho,\n\n433 F.3d at 64, by conceding that such a categorical substitution,\n\nwhich he sought below, is now precluded but arguing that the court\n\nnevertheless should have considered the crack/powder disparity in\n\ndetermining   whether    the   resulting    sentence    was   greater   than\n\nnecessary under 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).       That argument is unavailing.\n\n           Although Pho left open the possibility that \"the nature\n\nof the contraband and/or the severity of a projected guideline\n\nsentence may . . . be taken into account on a case-by-case basis,\"\n\nid. at 65, Taffere points to no case-specific circumstances that\n\nwould   require   a   lesser   sentence   here.   The    judge   explicitly\n\nconsidered the only potentially mitigating circumstances brought to\n\nhis attention by defense counsel--Taffere's difficult adjustment to\n\nlife in the United States, to which he had immigrated at a young\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fage     from    the   Sudan,   and   his   post-conviction       efforts   at\n\nrehabilitation,       including   obtaining   his    GED--but    nevertheless\n\nconcluded that a lesser sentence would not fulfill the criteria set\n\nforth    in     section   3553(a),   including      deterrence    and   public\n\nprotection, and that a reduction based on the crack/powder cocaine\n\ndifferential would create rather than avoid sentencing disparity\n\namong different judges and districts. In imposing a sentence below\n\nthe statutory minimum (pursuant to the safety valve) and just one\n\nmonth above the bottom of the applicable guidelines range, the\n\njudge expressed his hope that the relatively light sentence would\n\nafford Taffere the opportunity for rehabilitation.               He also took\n\ninto account Taffere's strong family ties by recommending that he\n\nbe imprisoned in Pennsylvania, where his family had relatives with\n\nwhom they could stay while visiting him.         Under Navedo-Concepción,\n\n450 F.3d at 58, the \"not greater than necessary\" language of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(a) requires no further explanation of why a still\n\nlighter sentence would be inadequate.\n\n               Accordingly, the sentence is affirmed.       See 1st Cir. R.\n\n27(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\f",
