Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Selya and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n    William S. Smith on Anders brief for appellant.\n\n\n\n                           June 23, 2004\n\f           Per Curiam.   In this direct criminal appeal, counsel for\n\nthe appellant filed a motion to withdraw and a brief under Anders\n\nv. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967).             We grant the motion to\n\nwithdraw and affirm appellant's conviction and sentence as provided\n\nherein.    We publish our opinion in order to ensure the uniform\n\ndisposition of other pending criminal appeals raising substantially\n\nthe same issue as this case.1\n\n           Appellant Bernard Lewandowski pled guilty to being a\n\nfelon in possession of a firearm and was sentenced as an armed\n\ncareer criminal. The district court imposed a prison term followed\n\nby a term of supervised release.           The court also           imposed a\n\nspecial condition of release requiring Lewandowski to participate\n\nin a drug treatment program with periodic drug testing.                As the\n\nrecord indicates, Lewandowski is a long-time heroin addict who\n\nacknowledges that he needs treatment if he is to abstain from\n\nfuture criminal activity.\n\n           In   reviewing   the   record   in   this   case,   we    found   a\n\npotentially troublesome boilerplate condition of supervised release\n\nin the judgment form used by the district court (AO 245B, Rev.\n\n9/00).    The condition requires appellant to \"submit to one drug\n\ntest within 15 days of release from imprisonment and at least two\n\n\n\n     1\n      Prior to issuing this opinion, we gave the parties an\nopportunity to comment on our approach. Counsel for the appellant\nelected not to respond, and the government advised us that it had\nno objection.\n\n                                   -2-\n\fperiodic tests thereafter.\"2         Thus, by using this judgment form,\n\nthe district court arguably specified only the minimum number of\n\ndrug tests -- three -- that Lewandowski was required to undergo\n\nwhile on supervised release.          As we recently held, however, 18\n\nU.S.C. ยง 3583(d) \"requires courts to determine the maximum number\n\nof drug tests to be performed beyond the statutory minimum of\n\nthree.\"   United States v. Melendez-Santana, 353 F.3d 93, 106 (1st\n\nCir. 2003) (emphasis supplied).         In that case, we invalidated a\n\nsupervised      release   condition        explicitly     delegating    that\n\ndetermination to the probation officer.          Here, there was no such\n\nexplicit delegation, and we do not believe that any such delegation\n\nwas intended.     But the court's order did not definitively declare\n\nwho was to determine the maximum number of drug tests, and,\n\ninasmuch as the probation officer has the responsibility for\n\nmonitoring the defendant while on supervised release, counsel\n\nconceivably could argue that there was an implicit delegation to\n\nthe probation officer.\n\n             There is no need to ask counsel for an advocate's brief,\n\nhowever, as we may construe the supervised release condition to\n\navoid any delegation problem.        See, e.g., United States v. Schave,\n\n186   F.3d    839,   843-44   (7th    Cir.    1999)     (adopting   limiting\n\n\n\n      2\n      We view this condition, which was mandated by 18 U.S.C. ยง\n3583(d), as separate from the special condition of supervised\nrelease that required appellant to attend a treatment program that\nincluded drug testing.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fconstruction     of   supervised     release   condition      to   avoid\n\nconstitutional problems).     We construe the condition to cap the\n\nnumber of drug tests at three, i.e., to state both the maximum and\n\nminimum number of tests.     In effect, we read the words \"at least\"\n\nout of the condition as imposed, so that it requires only three\n\ndrug tests during the supervised release term.         Our interpretation\n\ndoes not affect the number of drug tests that may be ordered in\n\nconsequence of the treatment program that Lewandowski must attend\n\nwhile on supervised release.       See supra note 2.\n\n          As this opinion indicates, district judges using the\n\nboilerplate form at issue here who wish to require more than the\n\nstatutory minimum of three drug tests must make that clear at\n\nsentencing.    They must either state the maximum number of tests or\n\ndescribe a suitable range.    See Melendez-Santana, 353 F.3d at 103.\n\nIn addition, probation officers who monitor supervisees subject to\n\nthe drug testing condition we consider here may not require more\n\nthan the minimum three tests without obtaining a modification of\n\nthe condition under 18 U.S.C. ยง 3583(e).\n\n          Apart from the delegation issue, we have found no other\n\nnon-frivolous issue in our review of the record.            Accordingly,\n\ncounsel may withdraw. See Anders, 386 U.S. at 744 (indicating that\n\ncourt of appeals may allow counsel to withdraw if the appeal is\n\n\"wholly frivolous\").\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f          We    grant   counsel's    motion    to   withdraw and affirm\n\nappellant's    conviction.    We    affirm    appellant's   sentence   as\n\nconstrued herein.   The appeal is terminated.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f",
