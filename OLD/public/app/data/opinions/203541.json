Paul J. Barbadoro,         U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Paul H. Cossette on brief pro se.\n     T. David Plourde, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Thomas P.\nColantuono, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          October 27, 2008\n\f             Per Curiam.    Appellant Paul H. Cossette has appealed the\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of the U.S. Dept. of Agriculture\n\n(USDA) on Cossette's claim that the USDA failed to hire him due to\n\nage discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination in\n\nEmployment Act, 29 U.S.C. ยง 621 et seq.             We review, de novo, the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment.               Arroyo-Audifred v.\n\nVerizon Wireless, Inc., 527 F.3d 215, 217 (1st Cir. 2008) (reciting\n\nstandard of review).\n\n             Upon de novo review, we affirm, essentially for the\n\nreasons stated in the district court's opinion.                   Cossette v.\n\nJohanns, 525 F.2d 242 (D. N.H. 2007).           We need only briefly address\n\nhere Cossette's appellate claims.             Despite Cossette's insistence\n\nthat   the   \"specialized    experience\"       required   was   restricted   to\n\nfinancially-based experience, the record supports the legitimacy of\n\nthe    USDA's   interpretation     of     its     \"specialized     experience\"\n\nqualification to require the particular knowledge, skills, and\n\nabilities that is typically in or related to the natural resources\n\nassociated with the position sought.            As Cossette did not possess\n\nthis specialized experience, he was not qualified for the position\n\nand,   thus,    did   not   make   out    a     prima   facie    case   of   age\n\ndiscrimination. See Arroyo-Audifred v. Verizon Wireless, Inc., 527\n\nF.3d at 219 (setting out what constitutes a prima facie case).\n\nAnd, since Cossette did not make out a prima facie case of age\n\ndiscrimination, Cossette's complaint that the district court failed\n\n                                    -2-\n\fto address his argument of disparate treatment is misplaced.                  See\n\nPrescott v. Higgins, 538 F.3d 32, 40-41 (1st Cir. 2008) (a claim of\n\ndisparate treatment is legally insufficient if claimant not able to\n\nmeet prima facie burden of showing that he is qualified for the\n\nposition).\n\n             Finally, the district court did not abuse its discretion\n\nin denying either Cossette's motion for reconsideration or his\n\nmotion to amend that motion for reconsideration.                Ruiz Rivera v.\n\nPfizer Pharmaceuticals, LLC, 521 F.3d 76, 81 (1st Cir.) (reciting\n\nstandard of review), petition for cert. filed, 77 U.S.L.W. 3001\n\n(Jun. 19, 2008).            In seeking reconsideration, Cossette simply\n\nrestated arguments that the court had already properly rejected and\n\nin   seeking    to    amend    that   motion     Cossette   sought    to   proffer\n\ndocuments that were neither newly discovered nor, in any event,\n\ncreated a genuine issue of material fact as to whether Cossette was\n\nqualified for the position.           See U.S. Steel v. M. DeMatteo Const.\n\nCo.,   315     F.3d   43,     52   (1st   Cir.   2002)   (documents    in   one's\n\npossession, even if unreviewed, do not constitute newly discovered\n\nevidence).\n\n             The judgment of the district court entered on December 4,\n\n2007 is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f",
