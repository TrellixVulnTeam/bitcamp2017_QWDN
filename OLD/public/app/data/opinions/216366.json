Nathaniel M. Gorton, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                  Torruella, Boudin and Lipez,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Timothy G. Watkins, Federal Public Defender, on brief for\nappellant.\n     Kelly Begg Lawrence, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Carmen M.\nOrtiz, United States Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n                           May 9, 2011\n\f          Per Curiam.   Robert Adams pled guilty to being a felon-\n\nin-possession, in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1), and was\n\nsentenced on April 14, 2010, to 110 months imprisonment.    A week\n\nprior, i.e., on April 7, 2010, the U.S. Sentencing Commission had\n\nvoted to eliminate the \"recency\" points assessed by § 4A1.1(e).\n\nThat proposed amendment (\"Amendment 742\") became effective on\n\nNovember 1, 2010.   Amendment 742 is not listed as a retroactive\n\namendment in § 1B1.10(c).   Had Amendment 742 either been effective\n\nas of, or retroactive to, April 14, 2010, Adams's criminal history\n\ncategory (\"CHC\") would have been CHC V, instead of CHC VI, and his\n\nguideline sentencing range (\"GSR\") would have been 100-120 months,\n\nrather than 110-120 months.\n\n          Adams concedes that his GSR was properly calculated\n\npursuant to the guidelines as they existed at the time of his April\n\n14, 2010 sentencing and he also concedes that Amendment 742 is not\n\nretroactive. Nonetheless, Adams argues that his 110 month sentence\n\nis unreasonable and the district court, having been apprised by his\n\ncounsel at the sentencing hearing of the Commission's policy\n\nchange, abused its discretion in sentencing him based on a GSR that\n\nwas only applicable to him due to the addition of \"recency\" points.\n\nIn particular, Adams cites to the district court's remarks that it\n\ngives the guidelines respectful consideration \"because they are a\n\nproduct of careful study, based on extensive, empirical evidence.\"\n\nAdams points out that the Commission decided to eliminate \"recency\"\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fpoints precisely because recidivism data demonstrated that there is\n\nno empirical justification for the addition of \"recency\" points.\n\n            We   find   no   abuse   of   discretion.   United     States   v.\n\nBunchan, 626 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir. 2010) (reciting standard of\n\nreview), cert. denied, 131 S.Ct. 1579 (U.S. Feb. 28, 2011) (No. 10-\n\n8537).     The district court clearly did not think that Adams's\n\ncriminal history was overstated.          In denying Adams's request for a\n\ndownward variance to 84 months (an issue that Adams does not pursue\n\non appeal), the court cited to Adams's demonstrated recidivism,\n\nreferring to Adams's \"persistent and unrelenting criminal conduct\"\n\nand the fact that Adams had \"proven time and again that you are a\n\nvery dangerous and violent criminal who needs to be incarcerated to\n\nprotect the public and the potential victims of your crimes.\"               It\n\nrecited that Adams had already received a break with respect to the\n\ncharging in the case, since Adams could have been charged with a\n\ndrug offense and classified as a career offender with a drastically\n\nincreased GSR.     A career offender criminal history category is CHC\n\nVI.   And, the government averred that Adams's resulting GSR as a\n\ncareer offender would have been 188-235 months. The concern of the\n\nSentencing Commission that prompted the elimination of § 4A1.1(e)\n\n-- that \"recency\" points have excessive weight in the determination\n\nof the applicable GSR and only minimally improve the ability of the\n\ncriminal    history     score   to   predict   the   defendant's    risk    of\n\nrecidivism -- has little impact in this case.           The two \"recency\"\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fpoints triggered the CHC VI in this case.      But Adams could just\n\nhave easily been classified as a career offender, triggering the\n\nsame CHC VI, demonstrating that CHC VI did not overstate his\n\ncriminal history.   And, the concern that \"recency\" points are poor\n\npredictors of a risk of recidivism is simply overshadowed by\n\nAdams's own exhibited history of recidivism.\n\n          While Adams correctly notes that we have previously\n\nremanded cases for reconsideration of a sentence in light of a\n\nlater amendment to the guidelines that reflected a change in\n\nCommission policy, even where that amendment had not been made\n\nretroactive, we find neither United States v. Godin, 522 F.3d 133\n\n(1st Cir. 2008), nor United States v. Ahrendt, 560 F.3d 69 (1st\n\nCir. 2009), controlling here. In Adams's case, unlike either Godin\n\nor Ahrendt, the district court was made aware at sentencing of the\n\nproposed guideline amendment and, from aught that appears, the\n\ncourt was unmoved by the prospect of the elimination of the\n\n\"recency\" points.   The doubt triggering our concern in Godin and\n\nAhrendt that the district court would reconsider the sentences in\n\nlight of the now-revised thinking of the Commission is absent here.\n\nDecisions such as Godin turn in part on a fact specific judgment\n\nthat a different result might well be reached on remand in light of\n\nthe circumstances in the case.   This judgment may not be common but\n\nwe think that in the interests of justice the possibility of such\n\na remand should be preserved.\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f           Lastly, the several courts of appeals to have considered\n\nthe   issue   have     rejected       claims   of     error,     substantive\n\nunreasonableness, and/or declined to remand for a district court's\n\nreconsideration   of   a   criminal    sentence     imposed    prior   to   the\n\nelimination of the guidelines' \"recency\" points. See United States\n\nv. Ball, 2011 WL 925454 (3d Cir. 2011) (finding sentence was not\n\nsubstantively unreasonable where district court declined to vary\n\nCHC based on proposed elimination of \"recency\" points);                United\n\nStates v. Gonzalez-Molina, 2011 WL 280842 (5th Cir. 2011) (denying\n\na remand for district court to consider Amendment 742 for a\n\nsentence imposed prior to November 1, 2010);          In re Anderson, 2011\n\nWL 240779 (3d Cir. 2011) (denying writs of mandamus and audita\n\nquerela to compel district court, pursuant to Amendment 742, to\n\nreduce sentence imposed prior to November 1, 2010); United States\n\nv. Gadsden, 2011 WL 179621 (3d Cir. 2011) (finding no district\n\ncourt error in assigning recency points under guidelines applicable\n\nat time of sentencing, despite later enactment of Amendment 742),\n\ncert. denied, ___ S.Ct. ___ (U.S. Apr 25, 2011) (No. 10-9782);\n\nUnited States v.
