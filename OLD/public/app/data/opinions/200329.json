Marwan Youssef Albathani, a native\n\nand citizen of Lebanon, petitions for review of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeal's (BIA's) summary affirmance of an Immigration\n\nJudge's denial of his application for asylum, withholding of\n\ndeportation, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against\n\nTorture.   His case raises a challenge, new for this court, to the\n\nvalidity of the BIA's streamlining procedures adopted in 1999.    8\n\nC.F.R. ยง 3.1(a)(7)(2002)(amended by 67 Fed. Reg. 54,878 (Aug. 26,\n\n2002)).\n\n           Albathani, a Maronite Christian, sought asylum on the\n\nbasis that he feared persecution by members of Hezbollah active in\n\nLebanon.   He arrived in the United States in January 1999 without\n\nany valid documents permitting entry. He was taken into custody by\n\nthe INS and had an initial interview and a subsequent credible fear\n\ninterview; he was found to have a credible fear of persecution.   He\n\nwas allowed to remain in the United States pending a hearing on his\n\nasylum and other claims.    At the hearing in September 2000, the\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) found Albathani's story not credible and\n\ndenied his application.    Her finding was affirmed by the BIA in a\n\nsummary affirmance under 8 C.F.R. ยง 3.1(a)(7).\n\n           Albathani challenges this ruling on several grounds: both\n\nthat his hearing before the IJ denied him due process of law, for\n\nseveral reasons, and that the summary affirmance procedure itself\n\nviolates due process. Additionally, an amici curiae brief filed by\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fthe American Immigration Law Foundation, the New England Chapter of\n\nthe American Immigration Lawyers Association, and the Massachusetts\n\nLaw Reform Institute argues that the summary affirmance procedure\n\nalso violates rules of administrative law.1             We affirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n               From the 1940s to the 1970s, political power has been\n\nshared    in     Lebanon     between     members   of   different     religious\n\ncommunities.         The president is traditionally a Maronite Christian,\n\nwhile    the    prime    minister   is   traditionally    a   Sunni   Muslim.\n\nLebanon's Parliament is also divided on a system of proportional\n\nrepresentation based on religion.              This compromise broke down in\n\nthe 1970s, however.         Between 1975 and 1990, Lebanon was wracked by\n\nconflict, both between Lebanese Christians and Muslims, and among\n\nforeign forces.         According to the State Department, non-Lebanese\n\nmilitary forces control much of the country.            See Malek v. INS, 198\n\nF.3d 1016, 1018 (7th Cir. 2000).                A variety of militias are\n\nassociated with different groups in Lebanon, both foreign and\n\ndomestic.      The conflict between two of those militias is pertinent\n\nhere: the Lebanese Forces, a rightist, Christian militia, and\n\nHezbollah, an Islamicist militia with foreign support.\n\n               The    Lebanese Forces was affiliated with the Christian\n\nPhalangist militia, a Maronite group which had fought against\n\n\n\n     1\n        We express our appreciation to amici for their valuable\nassistance.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fMuslim nationalists in 1975, touching off Lebanon's civil war.\n\nThe Lebanese Forces was founded in 1976.      In 1991, it was licensed\n\nas a political party, but in 1994 it was banned and a number of\n\nmembers were arrested because of alleged involvement in the bombing\n\nof a church.    The leader of the Lebanese Forces, Samir Geagea, was\n\nalso arrested and charged with the murder of a political rival.         In\n\n1995, Geagea was found guilty and sentenced to death, although the\n\nsentence was commuted to life imprisonment.        Subsequently, Geagea\n\nwas charged with the 1987 assassination of Muslim Prime Minister\n\nRashid Karami. Other members of the Lebanese Forces were convicted\n\nof a 1996 bus bombing in Syria which killed eleven people.\n\n             Hezbollah, meanwhile, is a Shia Muslim political group\n\nbacked by Iran.       It became prominent in the mid-1980s in battles\n\nagainst Israeli forces in southern Lebanon.        In Lebanon, Hezbollah\n\noperates in the Bekaa Valley, the southern suburbs of Beirut, and\n\nsouthern Lebanon.      It is known or suspected to have been involved\n\nin terrorist attacks including the truck bombings of the U.S.\n\nEmbassy and marine barracks in Beirut in October 1983.           See U.S.\n\nDep't   of   State,    Background   Information   on   Foreign   Terrorist\n\nOrganizations (Oct. 8, 1999), available at http:/www.state.gov/\n\nwww/global/terrorism/fto_info_1999.html.          On November 2, 2001,\n\nHezbollah was added to the list of terrorists and groups linked to\n\nterrorism covered by Executive Order No. 13,224, 66 Fed. Reg.\n\n49,079 (Sept. 23, 2001), which blocked access to their assets. See\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fU.S. Dep't of State, Comprehensive List of Terrorists and Groups\n\nIdentified    Under   Executive   Order   13224,   available   at   http:\n\nwww.state.gov/s/ct/rls/fs/2001/6531.htm.\n\n            Marwan Albathani, a Maronite Christian, was born in\n\nLebanon on November 15, 1973, and grew up in the midst of this\n\nconflict.     Members of his family were involved in the Lebanese\n\nForces, including an older brother, who was a captain of the\n\nLebanese Forces in the Dikwane district of Beirut. Albathani lived\n\nin Beirut, as did some of his sisters and brothers.      His father and\n\nother sisters lived in Deir El-Ahmar, approximately two hours to\n\nthe east of Beirut.     Other of his relatives lived in the United\n\nStates.   Albathani sometimes worked in Beirut, sometimes not; when\n\nhe worked it was as either a car mechanic or a car dealer.\n\nAlbathani asserted that after persecution by members of Hezbollah\n\nhe decided to flee Lebanon.\n\n             Albathani traveled to Cyprus in November 1998, where he\n\napplied for a tourist visa to the United States but did not seek\n\nrefugee status.    On his application, Albathani claimed that he was\n\nmarried, that he worked as an electrician, that he had no relatives\n\nin the United States, and that he had no intention of working or\n\nstudying in the United States (all untrue).           Albathani's visa\n\napplication was denied.      Albathani then returned to Cyprus in\n\nJanuary 1999, with a visa to Panama, purchased a plane ticket to\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fPanama by way of London and Miami, and got off in Miami on January\n\n14.    He was immediately taken into custody by INS officers.\n\nA.    Initial INS Interview\n\n            That day an INS officer with a translator interviewed\n\nAlbathani. Albathani said he was \"escaping from Lebanon because of\n\nthe Hezbollah,\" which was harassing him because he was not Muslim.\n\nHe said that he was a car salesman, and that both his mother and\n\nbrother resided legally in the United States.    Albathani admitted\n\nthat he had no intention of going to Panama and wanted to stay in\n\nthe United States.      Based on this initial interview, the INS\n\nofficer scheduled a further credible fear interview.\n\nB.    Credible Fear Interview\n\n            During his credible fear interview on January 27, 1999,\n\nthree different interpreters were required before one was found who\n\ncould understand Albathani's difficult accent.   Albathani told the\n\ninterviewing INS officer that he had served as a \"regular soldier\"\n\nin the Lebanese Forces for five years.    His problems began in the\n\nmid-1990s; at that time whenever he visited his family in Deir El-\n\nAhmar he was stopped and questioned by members of Hezbollah.     On\n\none occasion, three months before he left Lebanon, according to\n\nAlbathani, he was stopped for four hours.   He and his brother were\n\ntied up, Albathani was slapped in the face, they were placed in the\n\ntrunk of a car, and robbed of $1,200 and some jewelry.    Albathani\n\nattributed this to Hezbollah knowledge that he was a member of the\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fLebanese Forces. He said that he was arrested \"several times,\" but\n\ncould not provide a specific number.       He had to leave Lebanon\n\nbecause he feared being kidnapped by Hezbollah members.\n\n          Based on this interview, Albathani was found to have a\n\ncredible fear of prosecution based on membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, namely the Lebanese Forces.    The officer found that\n\nhe was credible, that his testimony was \"detailed, internally\n\nconsistent, consistent [with] country conditions and any other\n\nextrinsic evidence,\" and that there was a \"significant possibility\n\nthat he ... could establish eligibility for asylum.\" Albathani was\n\nsubsequently allowed to move from Miami to New Hampshire, where his\n\nfamily was located.2\n\nC.   Asylum Hearing\n\n          Albathani had submitted an application for asylum on\n\nOctober 14, 1999, in Miami.      He admitted his illegal entry and\n\nconceded deportability.    His application for asylum described two\n\nassaults by Hezbollah.    In the first, in April 1996, he claimed he\n\nwas stopped, interrogated, jailed in the town of Vaibalk, beaten\n\nand left by a roadside.   He said he was then picked up and taken to\n\na hospital, where he remained in a coma for over two weeks.   In the\n\nsecond, more than two years later, he asserted he was again stopped\n\n\n\n     2\n        Once in the United States, Albathani was arrested twice,\nonce for using someone else's credit card (although he claimed to\nbe merely trying to return it), and once for selling alcohol to a\nminor.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fand   beaten,   robbed   of   his    car    and   money,   and   his    life    was\n\nthreatened.     Albathani     said    that   this   assault      took   place    in\n\nDecember 1998, although in both his credible fear interview and the\n\nsubsequent hearing before the IJ he dated it earlier, in either\n\nSeptember or October 1998.          No mention is made of a later threat.\n\nAlbathani also described his work in the Lebanese Forces in greater\n\ndetail, alleging that he had been a member since 1989, that he\n\nworked as a secretary from 1989 to 1992, and that from 1992 to 1998\n\nhe served as bodyguard for the group's leader.               Albathani sought\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations\n\nConvention Against Torture.\n\n           Albathani's asylum hearing took place in Boston, after he\n\nwas granted a change of venue from Miami.             In the hearing before\n\nthe IJ on September 28, 2000, Albathani had one interpreter; the IJ\n\nexpressed concerns that the interpreter had not brought an Arabic\n\ndictionary and had engaged in numerous colloquies with Albathani.\n\nAlbathani was the only witness.\n\n           Albathani testified about two beatings on the road to his\n\nparents' house which were sketched out in his asylum application.\n\nWe summarize what he said.            The Lebanese Forces had ceased to\n\nparticipate as a political party as of 1995, and \"had fallen\n\napart,\" prior to both incidents.             The area around his parents'\n\nhouse was controlled by Hezbollah.           Hezbollah had a list of names\n\nof those who had served in the Lebanese Forces.                  In 1996, when\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fdriving alone, Albathani was stopped by individuals he recognized\n\nas Hezbollah because of distinctive flags on their cars.                They\n\nasked for his ID, took all his belongings, blindfolded him and hit\n\nhim.   Albathani lost consciousness during the beating and woke up\n\nin a hospital. Albathani reported this to the police, who declined\n\nto get involved with Hezbollah-related incidents. When asked if he\n\nhad a copy of the police report, the interpreter reported his reply\n\nas, \"No, he wasn't worried about the problem, [w]hen they told me\n\nthat they can't help me when it comes to Hezbollah.\"\n\n           In the next two years, there were no further incidents.\n\nThat was because Albathani was so afraid he did not go out.             When\n\nquestioned on this point he replied he did not mean he was afraid\n\nto go out, or to leave the house in Beirut, but he did not dare\n\ndrive to see his parents.     He did, however, travel to Syria and\n\nreturn to Lebanon sometime in the fall of 1998, shortly before the\n\nsecond beating.   As to the 1998 incident, Albathani testified            to\n\nthe following.     In   September    or   October   1998,   Albathani    was\n\ntravelling with his younger brother and a friend to his parents'\n\nhouse when they were stopped at a Hezbollah roadblock.          Albathani\n\nwas again asked for his ID, his belongings were taken, and he was\n\nbeaten on his head and hands.    Hezbollah asked him how long he had\n\nbeen with the Lebanese Forces.      Afraid, he denied he had ever been.\n\nAs he was being beaten, his captors told him \"say that you were in\n\nthe Lebanese Forces, otherwise you die.\"       Albathani was again left\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\funconscious, and woke up in a hospital.            His younger brother was\n\nblindfolded, but not beaten or robbed.\n\n            On both occasions, Albathani's cars -- both Mercedes --\n\nwere stolen by Hezbollah.     He had scars on his back, hands and head\n\nas a result of the two beatings.         The IJ suggested that photographs\n\nof them should be submitted so it would be in the record, but\n\ndeclined to make a closer firsthand examination of the scars.            The\n\nrecord shows the IJ had a clear view of petitioner during the\n\nhearing.\n\n            In December 1998, members of the Hezbollah went to\n\nAlbathani's sister's house and told her \"if he stays over here he\n\nshould consider death for himself.          The first time he was able to\n\nrun away, but now it's going to be death for him.\"                  Shortly\n\nthereafter, he looked for help to leave Lebanon.                The message\n\ntriggered his flight to the United States in January 1999.\n\n            During   the   period   of    the   incidents,   Albathani   left\n\nLebanon twice: once to Syria for two days, and once to Cyprus for\n\ntwo days.     He returned to Lebanon each time.         While in Cyprus in\n\nNovember 1998, he filled out a visa application, which contained\n\nfalsehoods.    During the hearing before the IJ, he explained the\n\nfalsehoods by saying that someone else, possibly his brother,\n\nfilled out the application; he just signed it.\n\n            The IJ rendered an oral decision the same day as the\n\nhearing.    She rejected Albathani's claim for relief under the\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fConvention Against Torture because he had not shown injury at the\n\nhands of the government. She also rejected Albathani's application\n\nfor   asylum     and    withholding        of   deportation.             The      IJ    found\n\nAlbathani's      testimony     not    credible,        noted      that       he   ran    into\n\ndifficulty with Hezbollah only when he drove the road to his\n\nparents' house, credited that he had been robbed but observed that\n\nhis brother (who was with him during the incident) was neither\n\nharmed nor robbed, and commented that Albathani had returned to\n\nLebanon from Cyprus after the incidents.\n\n           The IJ found Albathani's testimony not credible for a\n\nnumber of reasons.           The details of the incidents varied from\n\ntelling to telling, and there were internal contradictions in his\n\naccount.    For example, he claimed at the asylum hearing to be\n\nunconscious    after     the   1998    beating,        but    said      in    the      earlier\n\ninterview that he and his brother had been slapped and their money\n\ntaken, they were forced into the trunk of a car, and driven to a\n\n\"dark   place\"    and    left.       Not    only      did    he   not    mention         being\n\nunconscious,      he    even   described        the    place      he     was      confined.\n\nMoreover, in the later account, Albathani said that his brother was\n\nunharmed, not placed in the trunk of a car, and did not have\n\nanything stolen from him.            The IJ concluded that this, and other\n\ninconsistencies, were material differences that made Albathani a\n\n\"less than credible witness.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f            The   IJ   also   noted   that     Albathani     had   not   produced\n\ncorroborative evidence in the form of testimony by relatives who\n\nwere in the United States. His mother lived in Boston and recently\n\nhad become an American citizen, but, for whatever reason, had left\n\nthe country two weeks before the scheduled hearing before the IJ.\n\nShe might have confirmed his testimony that she was at his hospital\n\nbedside after the 1998 incident.             He also had an uncle in Boston\n\nand his brother and cousin lived in the United States, none of whom\n\ntestified on his behalf.\n\n            The IJ cited Albathani's abuse of immigration procedures,\n\nboth   in   filling     out   the     application      for    a    tourist   visa\n\nfraudulently, and in not filing for admission to the United States\n\nas a refugee from persecution at the United States Embassy in\n\nCyprus.     See generally 8 U.S.C. ยง 1158 (2000)(describing normal\n\nasylum procedures).\n\n            The IJ also questioned whether the attacks were motivated\n\nby political reasons, noting that Albathani was robbed on both\n\noccasions, and deprived of not one but two Mercedes.                He also lost\n\na large amount of money -- $1,200 by his own account in one\n\nincident -- and gold jewelry.         She concluded, \"At least one of the\n\nmotives of the person stopping the car clearly appears to be\n\nrobbery.\"\n\n            Finally,    the   IJ    surmised    that   Albathani     could   have\n\navoided further incidents by relocation, either by leaving Lebanon,\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\for by changing his behavior. She cited Albathani's visits to Syria\n\nand Cyprus as evidence of his ability to avoid persecution without\n\nseeking   asylum    in   the   United    States.       She   concluded   that\n\nAlbathani's \"goal was to come to the United States,\" not to avoid\n\npersecution.     The IJ also focused on the fact that both incidents\n\ntook place in a single location -- the road between Beirut and Deir\n\nEl-Ahmar.     She suggested that Albathani could have avoided the\n\nproblem in Lebanon by seeking alternative routes or means of\n\ntransportation to his parents' home.\n\n            In sum, the IJ concluded that Albathani had not shown a\n\ncredible fear of persecution on one of the statutory grounds for\n\nasylum.     Because he failed to meet the test for asylum, he could\n\nnot meet the more stringent test for withholding of removal.               He\n\nalso was not entitled to relief under Article 3 of the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture as he had not shown he had been tortured at the\n\nhands of the government.3        The IJ ordered him deported from the\n\nUnited States.     Albathani appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA on\n\nOctober   28,   2000.    On    April    9,   2002,   utilizing   the   summary\n\n\n\n\n     3\n        The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85,\nwas implemented in the United States by the Foreign Affairs Reform\nand Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-277, ยง 2242, 112\nStat. 2681-761 (codified at 8 U.S.C. ยง 1231 (2000)). Article 3\nprohibits states from returning individuals to other states where\nthere are substantial grounds for believing they would be subject\nto torture.\n\n                                   -13-\n\faffirmance procedure, the BIA affirmed without opinion the results\n\nof the IJ's decision.\n\n                                          II.\n\n            Petitioner characterizes his challenge of the IJ/BIA\n\ndecision as being on due process grounds.                        He does not directly\n\nraise a claim that the decision is not supported by substantial\n\nevidence,    but    asserts     instead         that       the   decision      improperly\n\noverlooked evidence, that the judge improperly hurried the hearing\n\nalong, and that she berated the interpreter.                     The first ground is,\n\nin our view, just a variation on a substantial evidence challenge,\n\nand so we apply the usual substantial evidence standard.                               See,\n\ne.g., Mediouni v. INS, 314 F.3d 24, 26 (1st Cir. 2002); Cordero-\n\nTrejo v. INS, 40 F.3d 482, 487 (1st Cir. 1994).                     Determinations of\n\neligibility for asylum or withholding deportation are conclusive\n\n\"if supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a               whole.\"      INS v. Elias-Zacharias, 502\n\nU.S. 478, 481 (1992)(internal quotation omitted).\n\n            \"To    reverse     the   BIA     finding        we   must   find    that   the\n\nevidence not only supports that conclusion, but compels it.\"                           Id.\n\nat   481   n.1;   see   also    8    U.S.C.      ยง   1252    (b)(4)(B)(2000)(\"[T]he\n\nadministrative      findings        of    fact       are    conclusive      unless     any\n\nreasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary.\"); Aguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 569 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (no reversal unless \"the record evidence would compel a\n\n\n                                          -14-\n\freasonable factfinder to make a contrary determination\").                 Merely\n\nidentifying    alternative       findings   that   could   be    supported    by\n\nsubstantial    evidence     is    insufficient     to   supplant    the    BIA's\n\nfindings.     See Arkansas v. Oklahoma, 503 U.S. 91, 113 (1992).\n\n            The INS is not entitled to extreme deference, although\n\nour review is deferential.         Gailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 44 (1st\n\nCir. 1998).     Review of the BIA's decisions is conducted on the\n\nbasis of the entire record, not merely the evidence that supports\n\nthe BIA's conclusions.      Id.    Additionally, this \"court reviews the\n\nBIA's legal conclusions de novo, although it gives deference, where\n\nappropriate, to the agency's interpretation of the underlying\n\nstatute in accordance with administrative law principles.\"                 Debab\n\nv. INS, 163 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 1998) (internal quotation\n\nomitted).\n\n            Because   the    \"more    likely     than   not\"    standard     for\n\nwithholding deportation is more stringent than that for asylum, a\n\npetitioner unable to satisfy the asylum standard fails, a fortiori,\n\nto satisfy the former.       Mediouni, 314 F.3d at 27.          \"[W]ithholding\n\nis mandatory if an alien 'establishes that it is more likely than\n\nnot that he would be subject to persecution on one of the specified\n\ngrounds.'\"      INS v.

For that\n\nreason, we consider first the denial of Albathani's application for\n\nasylum.\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\f                                 III.\n\nA.   Denial of the Application for Asylum\n\n           The burden of proof for establishing eligibility for\n\nasylum lies on the petitioner.        8 C.F.R. ยง 208.13(a).       Applicants\n\nmust show either past persecution or well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution.     Id. ยง 208.13(b).      Such past or future persecution\n\nmust be based on \"race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nparticular     social   group,   or     political   opinion.\"        Id.   ยง\n\n208.13(b)(1).    The    petitioner    bears   the   burden   of    providing\n\n\"conclusive evidence\" that he was targeted on any of the five\n\ngrounds.   Velรกsquez v. Ashcroft, No. 01-1741, 2002 WL 31904478, at\n\n*2 (1st Cir. Dec. 30, 2002); see, e.g., Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at\n\n571 (finding that petitioner failed to carry his burden in proving\n\npast persecution because his account lacked the requisite degree of\n\nspecificity, and because \"the vague evidence of alleged persecution\n\nthat the petitioner adduced failed to establish a sufficient nexus\n\nbetween the events that he described and any ground enumerated\").\n\n             Here, we conduct our substantial evidence review of the\n\nIJ's decision regarding asylum and withholding of deportation,4\n\nrather than the BIA's opinion.          \"Ordinarily, Courts of Appeals\n\nreview decisions of the [BIA], and not those of an IJ.             When the\n\nBIA does not render its own opinion, however, and either defers\n\n\n\n     4\n        Albathani does not appeal the IJ's decision regarding his\nclaim under the Convention Against Torture.\n\n                                     -16-\n\f[to] or adopts the opinion of the IJ, a Court of Appeals must then\n\nreview the decision of the IJ.\"       Gao v. Ashcroft, 299 F.3d 266, 271\n\n(3d Cir. 2002).\n\n           The   burden   was   on    Albathani   to    show   that   he   was\n\npersecuted based on his membership in a particular social group, or\n\nfor his political opinions.      See 8 C.F.R. ยง 208.13(b).        We assume\n\narguendo that membership in the Lebanese Forces satisfies the\n\n\"particular social group or political opinion\" categories.                 The\n\ndifficulty for Albathani is that the IJ did not find him credible\n\non these claims.    Accepting that he had been robbed and beaten by\n\nHezbollah, the IJ did not find this to be persecution based on one\n\nof the five categories.     The record provides adequate reason for\n\ndoubt.   The two incidents on the road may well have been, as the IJ\n\nsuggested, nothing more than the robbery of someone driving a\n\nMercedes with cash in his pocket.       The IJ thought Albathani's fear\n\nof persecution was undercut by his twice returning to Lebanon after\n\ntrips abroad.\n\n           It is true that the IJ did not specifically comment on\n\nhis evidence -- a significant omission -- that Hezbollah later\n\nvisited his sister's house and threatened him, and that this visit\n\nled him to seek refuge in the United States.           But there was reason\n\nto doubt the event occurred; only Albathani's word established it,\n\nand there was a conspicuous lack of corroborating evidence from his\n\nfamily members in America.       This is not an instance of the INS\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fimproperly   insisting     on   evidence    that    was    not     likely    to    be\n\navailable to a refugee.         See, e.g., Gailius, 147 F.3d at 45-46.\n\nThere is nothing in the record to establish that Albathani was\n\ndenied   communication     with    his    family    in    America.          He    was\n\nrepresented by counsel, and his cousin was present at one hearing\n\nwith him.    Indeed, Albathani was living with his brother in New\n\nHampshire at the time of the hearing, and his aunt was present at\n\nan earlier hearing.      He was also in contact with his older brother,\n\nthen in Brazil, who had been in the Lebanese Forces and could have\n\ncorroborated much of his story.\n\n            Petitioner    argues   that    the     IJ    ignored    evidence       of\n\nAlbathani's limited capacities in making her decision.                 We do not\n\nfind support for this.      The IJ's decision acknowledges Albathani's\n\nlimited education (he left school at 15) and claim that he had head\n\n\"trouble\" since his beatings in her decision. His inarticulateness\n\nat the hearing was recognized by both the IJ and his own counsel.\n\nThe IJ also noted Albathani's tendency to \"fluctuate\" on dates\n\nduring the hearing, but did not rely on such changes in her\n\ndecision.    For example, during the hearing Albathani initially\n\ntestified that his travel to Syria took place in 1999, even though\n\nhe had already left for the United States by that date.                     He also\n\ndemonstrated a tendency to agree with whatever assertion was put to\n\nhim. During cross-examination, Albathani said that during his trip\n\nto Syria, he had received passport stamps from both the Syrian and\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fLebanese border guards, testimony which was belied by his passport.\n\nThe IJ took these limitations into account, commenting during the\n\nhearing that she did not \"hold [his inarticulateness] against him.\"\n\n          Albathani's inconsistency problems go well beyond mere\n\nfluctuations.       He showed a pattern of embellishing his story. In\n\neach context, Albathani added a new incident.                            He originally\n\ndescribed a single beating (the 1998 one) in his credible fear\n\ninterview.      He    did    not     mention      at       that   time    that   he     was\n\nhospitalized    as    a     result    of       this    beating.          Then,   in    his\n\napplication,    Albathani      added       a    1996       incident,     complete      with\n\nhospitalization and a coma, as well as expanding the later incident\n\nto include almost a week's hospitalization. At the hearing itself,\n\nAlbathani mentioned for the first time a second incident in 1998,\n\nthe December threat delivered to his sister.                      Given this pattern,\n\nwe find adequate support for the IJ's reservations regarding\n\nAlbathani's credibility.\n\n             As petitioner points out, some instances in the record\n\nsupport his credibility. One example is his correct identification\n\nof a Lebanese Forces commander.                It is also true that the IJ did\n\nnot explicitly discuss the Country Conditions Report for Lebanon,\n\nadmitted into evidence, other than as useful background.                              These\n\nReports provide some support for Albathani's claimed fear of\n\nkidnapping    and    murder.       Hezbollah          is   reported      to   detain    and\n\nmistreat prisoners from groups to which it is opposed.                        There is no\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fevidence, however, of a pattern of kidnappings by Hezbollah in the\n\nlast decade, although kidnapping was widespread during the civil\n\nwar.       But these Reports would not have straightened out the\n\ninconsistencies in Albathani's own stories.\n\n             On our review of the entire record, we do not find\n\nevidence sufficient to compel reversal of the denial of Albathani's\n\nasylum claim.5     He, a fortiori, fails to satisfy the standard for\n\nwithholding of deportation. See Velรกsquez, 2002 WL 31904478, at *4\n\nn.2.\n\nB.   Due Process\n\n             Albathani raises before us a challenge he did not raise\n\nin such terms before the BIA: a procedural due process challenge to\n\nthe IJ's conduct of his hearing.    He alleges that the IJ improperly\n\nberated the interpreter, rushed the hearing along, sharply cross-\n\nexamined him, and refused to examine evidence of his beatings in\n\nthe form of scars.     Respondent says that any due process claim is\n\nwaived.     See Mendes v. INS, 197 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 1999)(holding\n\nthat petitioner \"waived his due process claim by failing to raise\n\nit at his deportation hearing, at his hearing for suspension of\n\ndeportation, or before the BIA\").       We bypass the waiver question\n\n\n\n\n       5\n        Albathani, citing Matter of Pula, 19 I. & N. Dec. 467 (BIA\n1987), says the INS gave too much weight to the circumvention of\norderly refugee procedures. The criticism is misplaced -- this was\nnot the sole or even primary focus of the IJ.\n\n                                 -20-\n\fbecause the claim is easily determined to be meritless, and because\n\nhe raised similar arguments, under a different label, to the BIA.\n\n            As an unadmitted alien present in the United States,\n\nAlbathani's due process rights are limited. See Kaplan v. Tod, 267\n\nU.S. 228, 230 (1925) (presence in the country immaterial because\n\nexcluded alien \"was still in theory of law at the boundary line and\n\nhad gained no foothold in the United States\").           As a result, many\n\nconstitutional protections are unavailable to Albathani.                See\n\nZadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001); see also Shaughnessy\n\nv. United States ex rel. Mezei, 345 U.S. 206, 212 (1953) (\"Whatever\n\nthe procedure authorized by Congress is, it is due process as far\n\nas an alien denied entry is concerned.\") (internal quotation\n\nomitted).\n\n            Moreover, even if Albathani were an admitted alien, the\n\nproblems he describes still would not rise to the level of a due\n\nprocess violation.       Albathani's real complaint is that he may have\n\nbeen misunderstood and that his lack of credibility was simply a\n\nfunction of bad interpreting. But there is nothing to suggest this\n\nis   so.    At   the    hearing,   neither   Albathani   nor   his   counsel\n\nquestioned the accuracy of the translation by the interpreter at\n\nthe IJ hearing.        Even now, Albathani does not identify points in\n\nthe hearing where the translation was inaccurate or misleading.\n\n            The IJ was, at times, short in her treatment of the\n\ninterpreter, but may have had cause.             \"[O]rdinary efforts at\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fcourtroom administration\" do not mean that the hearing was unfair,\n\neven where the judge was \"stern and short-tempered.\"     Morales v.\n\nINS, 208 F.3d 323, 327 (1st Cir. 2000).         Similarly, the IJ's\n\nattempts to expedite proceedings are \"not the stuff of which a due\n\nprocess violation can be fashioned.\"     Aguilar-Solis, 168 F.3d at\n\n569.       Indeed, Albathani's own counsel sought to expedite the\n\nhearing so that he could keep a scheduled court appearance that\n\nafternoon.     The IJ's cross-examination of Albathani is expressly\n\nauthorized by regulation.      See 8 C.F.R. 208.9(c) (\"The asylum\n\nofficer shall have authority to . . . question the applicant and\n\nany witnesses.\").    Moreover, with regard to the scars, Albathani's\n\ncounsel chose not to request more time to submit photographs.\n\n             Albathani had a full and fair hearing.\n\n                                  IV.\n\n             Petitioner, supported by amici, challenges the BIA's\n\naffirmance without opinion (AWO) procedure under which the IJ's\n\ndecision was upheld.      Petitioner claims that AWO violates due\n\nprocess; amici argue that it violates rules of administrative law.6\n\nBoth say there must be a more substantive statement of the reasons\n\nfor the BIA's decision.\n\n\n\n       6\n       Although amici may not present legal theories not argued by\nthe parties, see Lane v. First Nat'l Bank of Boston, 871 F.2d 166,\n175 (1st Cir. 1989)(an amicus may not \"interject into a case issues\nwhich the litigants, whatever their reasons might be, have chosen\nto ignore\"), we view amici in this case as presenting variations on\nthe arguments presented by Albathani.\n\n                                 -22-\n\f          The context of the claim is important.           An alien has no\n\nconstitutional    right    to   any     administrative    appeal    at   all.\n\nGuentchev v. INS, 77 F.3d 1036, 1037 (7th Cir. 1996); see also\n\nAbney v. United States, 431 U.S. 651, 656 (1977)(no constitutional\n\nright to appeal in criminal cases).          Nor has Congress given aliens\n\nany   statutory    right   to    an     administrative    appeal.        Such\n\nadministrative appeal rights as exist are created by regulations\n\npromulgated by the Attorney General.          See 8 C.F.R. ยง 3.1(b)(2002).\n\n          The Attorney General first adopted the AWO procedure at\n\nissue in 1999.     Rather than the usual three-member review, the\n\n\"affirmance without opinion\" procedure allowed for review of a case\n\nby a single member, who would affirm the IJ's decision with the\n\nstatement: \"The Board affirms, without opinion, the result of the\n\ndecision below.\"     8 C.F.R. ยง 3.1(a)(7)(iii) (2002).7             The AWO\n\nprocedure was limited to certain categories of cases, designated by\n\nthe Chairman of the BIA, see id. at (7)(i).              Once the case was\n\nselected by the Chairman, one-member review was permissible where\n\nthe Board member found that the case fit certain criteria:\n\n          (ii) The single Board Member to whom a case is assigned\n          may affirm the decision of the Service or the Immigration\n          Judge, without opinion, if the Board Member determines\n          that the result reached in the decision under review was\n          correct; that any errors in the decision under review\n          were harmless or nonmaterial; and that\n\n\n\n      7\n         The September 25, 2002 amendment to the regulations\nrestructured this section. See 67 Fed. Reg. 54,878 (Aug. 26, 2002)\n(to be codified at 8 C.F.R. ยง 3.1(e)(4)).\n\n                                      -23-\n\f          (A) the issue on appeal is squarely controlled by\n          existing Board or federal court precedent and does not\n          involve the application of precedent to a novel fact\n          situation; or\n          (B) the factual and legal questions raised on appeal are\n          so insubstantial that three-Member review is not\n          warranted.\n          (iii) If the Board Member determines that the decision\n          should be affirmed without opinion, the Board shall issue\n          an order that reads as follows: \"The Board affirms,\n          without opinion, the result of the decision below. The\n          decision   below   is,  therefore,   the   final   agency\n          determination. See 8 CFR 3.1(a)(7).\" An order affirming\n          without opinion, issued under authority of this\n          provision, shall not include further explanation or\n          reasoning. Such an order approves the result reached in\n          the decision below; it does not necessarily imply\n          approval of all of the reasoning of that decision, but\n          does signify the Board's conclusion that any errors in\n          the decision of the Immigration Judge or the Service were\n          harmless or nonmaterial.\n\nId. at (a)(7).8   A further provision provided for the single member\n\nto return the case for full three-member consideration in the event\n\nthat he or she determined that it was not suitable for one-member\n\ndetermination.    Id. at (7)(iv).\n\n\n\n\n     8\n        According to amici, the procedure was used sparingly until\nearly 2002. In February 2002, the Attorney General proposed new\nrules that would, inter alia, increase the range of cases that\ncould be reviewed under AWO procedure, and reduce the Board from 23\nmembers to 11 members.      The intent of the new rules was to\neliminate the backlog of pending cases by reducing the amount of\ntime allotted to each one. Since these new rules did not go into\neffect until September 2002, amici argue they had an immediate\nimpact by causing Board members who wished to retain their jobs to\nhurry through as many AWO cases as possible. Albathani's case,\namici argue, was heard under the 1999 regulations, but as part of\na rush to meet new expectations. Nonetheless, this appeal only\nconcerns the 1999 regulations under which his case was decided.\n\n                                -24-\n\f            Promulgation of the AWO regulations is within the power\n\nof the INS.9    \"[A]dministrative agencies should be free to fashion\n\ntheir own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry\n\ncapable    of   permitting   them    to    discharge      their   multitudinous\n\nduties.\"    Vt. Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. v. Natural Res. Def.\n\nCouncil, Inc., 435 U.S. 519, 543 (1978).\n\n            Petitioner   and   amici      present   two    theories   in   their\n\nchallenge to the AWO procedure.        The first is that the BIA decision\n\nis the final decision and a BIA summary affirmance does not provide\n\na reasoned basis for review.        The second is that a one-line summary\n\naffirmance provides no way for courts to police the BIA to see that\n\nit is actually doing its job according to the regulations it has\n\npromulgated. Albathani and amici argue that the 1999 AWO procedure\n\nviolates a basic principle of administrative law: the requirement\n\nthat agencies provide reasoned bases for their decision.                     As\n\nclassically formulated in SEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194\n\n(1946):\n\n            If the administrative action is to be tested by the basis\n            upon which it purports to rest, that basis must be set\n\n\n     9\n       It is possible that the outcome of increased use of summary\nprocedures will be to shift the backlog to the federal courts of\nappeal. Indeed, the Ninth Circuit is already projecting a dramatic\nthree-fold increase in the number of immigration appeals since\n2001. See L. Getter & J. Peterson, Speedier Rate of Deportation\nRulings Assailed, L.A. Times, Jan. 5, 2003, at A1. The highly-\nexpedited nature of the review may prompt even more appeals to the\ncourts. Still, as amici point out, many non-citizens are unable to\nafford legal counsel and do not have pro bono counsel, and this may\nchill their willingness to go to court.\n\n                                     -25-\n\f           forth with such clarity as to be understandable. It will\n           not do for a court to be compelled to guess at the theory\n           underlying the agency's action; nor can a court be\n           expected to chisel that which must be precise from what\n           the agency has left vague and indecisive.\n\nId. at 196-97.    But both overlook the plain language of Chenery,\n\nwhich   refers   to   agencies    in    their   entirety,    not   individual\n\ncomponents of agencies.       Here, the relevant agency -- the INS --\n\nhas presented a statement of reasons for its decision, albeit from\n\nthe IJ rather than the BIA.         Chenery does not require that this\n\nstatement come from the BIA rather than the IJ.\n\n           The BIA can adopt, without further explication, the IJ's\n\nopinion.   See Chen v. INS, 87 F.3d 5, 8 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"[W]e join\n\neight of our sister circuits in ruling that the Board need not\n\nwrite at length merely to repeat the IJ's findings of fact and his\n\nreasons for denying the requested relief, but, rather, having given\n\nindividualized consideration to a particular case, may simply state\n\nthat it affirms the IJ's decision for the reasons set forth in that\n\ndecision.\") (listing cases).\n\n           The   contention      here    is   that   the   AWO   procedure    is\n\ndistinguishable from Chen because it permits affirmance without\n\nopinion even when the BIA disagrees with the IJ's reasoning.                 The\n\nAWO regulation does indeed allow such an affirmance.               Because the\n\nsummary affirmance is only of the \"result\" and not the reasoning,\n\nthis means that courts of appeals are forced to review a decision\n\nwhich may or may not contain the reasoning of the BIA.              The court\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fthus reviews the BIA decision without knowing its basis.            The\n\nsummary affirmance scheme does create these problems, but they do\n\nnot render the scheme a violation of due process or render judicial\n\nreview impossible.    Nor does the scheme violate any statute.\n\n          The courts will continue to have the IJ's decision and\n\nthe record upon which it is based available for review.        See also\n\n8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(b)(4)(A) (\"[T]he court of Appeals shall decide the\n\npetition only on the administrative record on which the order of\n\nremoval is based.\").        This permits a court to carry out an\n\nintelligent review.\n\n          In functional terms, if the BIA does not independently\n\nstate a correct ground for affirmance in a case in which the\n\nreasoning proffered by the IJ is faulty, the BIA risks reversal on\n\nappeal.    One   of   the   several     justifications   for   Chenery's\n\nrequirement for explicit reasons derives from a limitation on the\n\ncourts' ability to substitute different grounds.         \"[A] reviewing\n\ncourt . . . must judge the propriety of such action solely by the\n\ngrounds invoked by the agency.    If those grounds are inadequate or\n\nimproper, the court is powerless to affirm the administrative\n\naction by substituting what it considers to be a more adequate or\n\nproper basis.\"   Chenery, 332 U.S. at 196; see also Fed. Power\n\nComm'n v. Texaco, Inc., 417 U.S. 380, 397 (1974) (\"[A]n agency's\n\norder must be upheld, if at all, on the same basis articulated in\n\n\n\n\n                                 -27-\n\fthe    order    by   the    agency   itself.\").10      In     short,   if   the    BIA\n\nidentifies an alternative satisfactory ground for upholding denial\n\nof asylum in a case with an otherwise unsatisfactory decision by\n\nthe IJ, it must state it or risk remand.             Ordinarily, the case will\n\nbe remanded to the agency, and the agency will not, in the end,\n\nhave saved any time or effort.\n\n               The more serious argument is that the very nature of the\n\none-line summary affirmance may mean that BIA members are not in\n\nfact engaged in the review required by regulation and courts will\n\nnot be able to tell.            Immigration decisions, especially in asylum\n\ncases, may have life or death consequences, and so the costs of\n\nerror are very high.              Amici point out that this fear is not\n\nabstract in light of the huge caseload faced by only 19 BIA\n\nmembers.       For example, the Board member who denied Albathani's\n\nappeal is recorded as having decided over 50 cases on October 31,\n\n2002, a rate of one every ten minutes over the course of a nine-\n\nhour    day.      See      L.   Getter   &   J.   Peterson,    Speedier     Rate   of\n\nDeportation Rulings Assailed, L.A. Times, Jan. 5, 2003, at A1.\n\n               In fact, it has taken us considerably longer than one day\n\nto review this case, and the record of the hearing itself could not\n\nbe reviewed in ten minutes.              In general, even when the IJ decides\n\nthe alien is not credible, there must be review of the record\n\n\n       10\n        Albathani argues that this very rule proves his point --\nthe court should know the true reasons for the BIA's action. Our\nanswer above applies to this as well.\n\n                                          -28-\n\fbefore the IJ by the BIA.   The BIA itself has, on review of the\n\nrecord, rejected lack of credibility determinations by the IJ.\n\nFurther, as we noted in Gailius, 147 F.3d at 47, there must be\n\nreasons for disbelief of uncontradicted testimony.   But our review\n\nhere confirms that if there were any deviation from what the\n\nregulations required of the single BIA member (and there is no\n\nreason to think there is any), then the error would be harmless.\n\nThere was a basis for affirmance and for summary affirmance.\n\n          Were there evidence of systemic violation by the BIA of\n\nits regulations, this would be a different case.     We would then\n\nhave to face, inter alia, the INS's claim that the decision to\n\nstreamline an immigration appeal is not reviewable by the courts\n\nbecause these are matters committed to agency discretion.   But see\n\nAbbott Labs. v. Gardner, 387 U.S. 136, 140 (1967) (presumption of\n\nreviewability of agency actions), abrogated in part by Califano v.\n\nSanders, 430 U.S. 99, 105 (1977) (holding that the APA is not to be\n\ninterpreted as an implied grant of subject-matter jurisdiction over\n\nagency decisions); Goncalves v. Reno, 144 F.3d 110, 127 (1st Cir.\n\n1998), cert. denied, 526 U.S. 1004 (1999) (upholding judiciary's\n\nrole in determining whether an agency's interpretation of a statute\n\nis permissible); cf. Saakian v. INS, 252 F.3d 21, 25-27 (1st Cir.\n\n2001)(remanding case where BIA failed to apply its own rules).   We\n\nare not willing, however, in the absence of such evidence, to infer\n\nfrom these numbers alone that the required review is not taking\n\n\n                               -29-\n\fplace.   Courts themselves use \"summary affirmance\" or \"summary\n\ndisposition\" procedures in which parties may receive one-line\n\ndispositions of their appeals.   See, e.g., 1st Cir. R. 27.1.   These\n\nare workload management devices that acknowledge the reality of\n\nhigh caseloads.   They do not, either alone or in combination with\n\ncaseload statistics, establish that the required review is not\n\ntaking place.\n\n          For these reasons, the challenges to the AWO procedure\n\nare rejected.\n\n                                  V.\n\n          The decision of the BIA is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\f",

Marwan Youssef Albathani, a native\n\nand citizen of Lebanon, petitions for review of the Board of\n\nImmigration Appeal's (BIA's) summary affirmance of an Immigration\n\nJudge's denial of his application for asylum, withholding of\n\ndeportation, and relief under the United Nations Convention Against\n\nTorture.   His case raises a challenge, new for this court, to the\n\nvalidity of the BIA's streamlining procedures adopted in 1999.    8\n\nC.F.R. ยง 3.1(a)(7)(2002)(amended by 67 Fed. Reg. 54,878 (Aug. 26,\n\n2002)).\n\n           Albathani, a Maronite Christian, sought asylum on the\n\nbasis that he feared persecution by members of Hezbollah active in\n\nLebanon.   He arrived in the United States in January 1999 without\n\nany valid documents permitting entry. He was taken into custody by\n\nthe INS and had an initial interview and a subsequent credible fear\n\ninterview; he was found to have a credible fear of persecution.   He\n\nwas allowed to remain in the United States pending a hearing on his\n\nasylum and other claims.    At the hearing in September 2000, the\n\nImmigration Judge (IJ) found Albathani's story not credible and\n\ndenied his application.    Her finding was affirmed by the BIA in a\n\nsummary affirmance under 8 C.F.R. ยง 3.1(a)(7).\n\n           Albathani challenges this ruling on several grounds: both\n\nthat his hearing before the IJ denied him due process of law, for\n\nseveral reasons, and that the summary affirmance procedure itself\n\nviolates due process. Additionally, an amici curiae brief filed by\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fthe American Immigration Law Foundation, the New England Chapter of\n\nthe American Immigration Lawyers Association, and the Massachusetts\n\nLaw Reform Institute argues that the summary affirmance procedure\n\nalso violates rules of administrative law.1             We affirm.\n\n                                         I.\n\n               From the 1940s to the 1970s, political power has been\n\nshared    in     Lebanon     between     members   of   different     religious\n\ncommunities.         The president is traditionally a Maronite Christian,\n\nwhile    the    prime    minister   is   traditionally    a   Sunni   Muslim.\n\nLebanon's Parliament is also divided on a system of proportional\n\nrepresentation based on religion.              This compromise broke down in\n\nthe 1970s, however.         Between 1975 and 1990, Lebanon was wracked by\n\nconflict, both between Lebanese Christians and Muslims, and among\n\nforeign forces.         According to the State Department, non-Lebanese\n\nmilitary forces control much of the country.            See Malek v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767060\"><a href=\"/opinion/767060/boutros-malek-v-immigration-and-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">198</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1016</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1018 (7th Cir. 2000).                A variety of militias are\n\nassociated with different groups in Lebanon, both foreign and\n\ndomestic.      The conflict between two of those militias is pertinent\n\nhere: the Lebanese Forces, a rightist, Christian militia, and\n\nHezbollah, an Islamicist militia with foreign support.\n\n               The    Lebanese Forces was affiliated with the Christian\n\nPhalangist militia, a Maronite group which had fought against\n\n\n\n     1\n        We express our appreciation to amici for their valuable\nassistance.\n\n                                         -3-\n\fMuslim nationalists in 1975, touching off Lebanon's civil war.\n\nThe Lebanese Forces was founded in 1976.      In 1991, it was licensed\n\nas a political party, but in 1994 it was banned and a number of\n\nmembers were arrested because of alleged involvement in the bombing\n\nof a church.    The leader of the Lebanese Forces, Samir Geagea, was\n\nalso arrested and charged with the murder of a political rival.         In\n\n1995, Geagea was found guilty and sentenced to death, although the\n\nsentence was commuted to life imprisonment.        Subsequently, Geagea\n\nwas charged with the 1987 assassination of Muslim Prime Minister\n\nRashid Karami. Other members of the Lebanese Forces were convicted\n\nof a 1996 bus bombing in Syria which killed eleven people.\n\n             Hezbollah, meanwhile, is a Shia Muslim political group\n\nbacked by Iran.       It became prominent in the mid-1980s in battles\n\nagainst Israeli forces in southern Lebanon.        In Lebanon, Hezbollah\n\noperates in the Bekaa Valley, the southern suburbs of Beirut, and\n\nsouthern Lebanon.      It is known or suspected to have been involved\n\nin terrorist attacks including the truck bombings of the U.S.\n\nEmbassy and marine barracks in Beirut in October 1983.

Members of his family were involved in the Lebanese\n\nForces, including an older brother, who was a captain of the\n\nLebanese Forces in the Dikwane district of Beirut. Albathani lived\n\nin Beirut, as did some of his sisters and brothers.      His father and\n\nother sisters lived in Deir El-Ahmar, approximately two hours to\n\nthe east of Beirut.     Other of his relatives lived in the United\n\nStates.   Albathani sometimes worked in Beirut, sometimes not; when\n\nhe worked it was as either a car mechanic or a car dealer.\n\nAlbathani asserted that after persecution by members of Hezbollah\n\nhe decided to flee Lebanon.\n\n             Albathani traveled to Cyprus in November 1998, where he\n\napplied for a tourist visa to the United States but did not seek\n\nrefugee status.    On his application, Albathani claimed that he was\n\nmarried, that he worked as an electrician, that he had no relatives\n\nin the United States, and that he had no intention of working or\n\nstudying in the United States (all untrue).           Albathani's visa\n\napplication was denied.      Albathani then returned to Cyprus in\n\nJanuary 1999, with a visa to Panama, purchased a plane ticket to\n\n\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fPanama by way of London and Miami, and got off in Miami on January\n\n14.    He was immediately taken into custody by INS officers.\n\nA.    Initial INS Interview\n\n            That day an INS officer with a translator interviewed\n\nAlbathani. Albathani said he was \"escaping from Lebanon because of\n\nthe Hezbollah,\" which was harassing him because he was not Muslim.\n\nHe said that he was a car salesman, and that both his mother and\n\nbrother resided legally in the United States.    Albathani admitted\n\nthat he had no intention of going to Panama and wanted to stay in\n\nthe United States.      Based on this initial interview, the INS\n\nofficer scheduled a further credible fear interview.\n\nB.    Credible Fear Interview\n\n            During his credible fear interview on January 27, 1999,\n\nthree different interpreters were required before one was found who\n\ncould understand Albathani's difficult accent.   Albathani told the\n\ninterviewing INS officer that he had served as a \"regular soldier\"\n\nin the Lebanese Forces for five years.    His problems began in the\n\nmid-1990s; at that time whenever he visited his family in Deir El-\n\nAhmar he was stopped and questioned by members of Hezbollah.     On\n\none occasion, three months before he left Lebanon, according to\n\nAlbathani, he was stopped for four hours.   He and his brother were\n\ntied up, Albathani was slapped in the face, they were placed in the\n\ntrunk of a car, and robbed of $1,200 and some jewelry.    Albathani\n\nattributed this to Hezbollah knowledge that he was a member of the\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fLebanese Forces. He said that he was arrested \"several times,\" but\n\ncould not provide a specific number.       He had to leave Lebanon\n\nbecause he feared being kidnapped by Hezbollah members.\n\n          Based on this interview, Albathani was found to have a\n\ncredible fear of prosecution based on membership in a particular\n\nsocial group, namely the Lebanese Forces.    The officer found that\n\nhe was credible, that his testimony was \"detailed, internally\n\nconsistent, consistent [with] country conditions and any other\n\nextrinsic evidence,\" and that there was a \"significant possibility\n\nthat he ... could establish eligibility for asylum.\" Albathani was\n\nsubsequently allowed to move from Miami to New Hampshire, where his\n\nfamily was located.2\n\nC.   Asylum Hearing\n\n          Albathani had submitted an application for asylum on\n\nOctober 14, 1999, in Miami.      He admitted his illegal entry and\n\nconceded deportability.    His application for asylum described two\n\nassaults by Hezbollah.    In the first, in April 1996, he claimed he\n\nwas stopped, interrogated, jailed in the town of Vaibalk, beaten\n\nand left by a roadside.   He said he was then picked up and taken to\n\na hospital, where he remained in a coma for over two weeks.   In the\n\nsecond, more than two years later, he asserted he was again stopped\n\n\n\n     2\n        Once in the United States, Albathani was arrested twice,\nonce for using someone else's credit card (although he claimed to\nbe merely trying to return it), and once for selling alcohol to a\nminor.\n\n                                 -7-\n\fand   beaten,   robbed   of   his    car    and   money,   and   his    life    was\n\nthreatened.     Albathani     said    that   this   assault      took   place    in\n\nDecember 1998, although in both his credible fear interview and the\n\nsubsequent hearing before the IJ he dated it earlier, in either\n\nSeptember or October 1998.          No mention is made of a later threat.\n\nAlbathani also described his work in the Lebanese Forces in greater\n\ndetail, alleging that he had been a member since 1989, that he\n\nworked as a secretary from 1989 to 1992, and that from 1992 to 1998\n\nhe served as bodyguard for the group's leader.               Albathani sought\n\nasylum, withholding of removal, and relief under the United Nations\n\nConvention Against Torture.\n\n           Albathani's asylum hearing took place in Boston, after he\n\nwas granted a change of venue from Miami.             In the hearing before\n\nthe IJ on September 28, 2000, Albathani had one interpreter; the IJ\n\nexpressed concerns that the interpreter had not brought an Arabic\n\ndictionary and had engaged in numerous colloquies with Albathani.\n\nAlbathani was the only witness.\n\n           Albathani testified about two beatings on the road to his\n\nparents' house which were sketched out in his asylum application.\n\nWe summarize what he said.            The Lebanese Forces had ceased to\n\nparticipate as a political party as of 1995, and \"had fallen\n\napart,\" prior to both incidents.             The area around his parents'\n\nhouse was controlled by Hezbollah.           Hezbollah had a list of names\n\nof those who had served in the Lebanese Forces.                  In 1996, when\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fdriving alone, Albathani was stopped by individuals he recognized\n\nas Hezbollah because of distinctive flags on their cars.                They\n\nasked for his ID, took all his belongings, blindfolded him and hit\n\nhim.   Albathani lost consciousness during the beating and woke up\n\nin a hospital. Albathani reported this to the police, who declined\n\nto get involved with Hezbollah-related incidents. When asked if he\n\nhad a copy of the police report, the interpreter reported his reply\n\nas, \"No, he wasn't worried about the problem, [w]hen they told me\n\nthat they can't help me when it comes to Hezbollah.\"\n\n           In the next two years, there were no further incidents.\n\nThat was because Albathani was so afraid he did not go out.             When\n\nquestioned on this point he replied he did not mean he was afraid\n\nto go out, or to leave the house in Beirut, but he did not dare\n\ndrive to see his parents.     He did, however, travel to Syria and\n\nreturn to Lebanon sometime in the fall of 1998, shortly before the\n\nsecond beating.   As to the 1998 incident, Albathani testified            to\n\nthe following.     In   September    or   October   1998,   Albathani    was\n\ntravelling with his younger brother and a friend to his parents'\n\nhouse when they were stopped at a Hezbollah roadblock.          Albathani\n\nwas again asked for his ID, his belongings were taken, and he was\n\nbeaten on his head and hands.    Hezbollah asked him how long he had\n\nbeen with the Lebanese Forces.      Afraid, he denied he had ever been.\n\nAs he was being beaten, his captors told him \"say that you were in\n\nthe Lebanese Forces, otherwise you die.\"       Albathani was again left\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\funconscious, and woke up in a hospital.            His younger brother was\n\nblindfolded, but not beaten or robbed.\n\n            On both occasions, Albathani's cars -- both Mercedes --\n\nwere stolen by Hezbollah.     He had scars on his back, hands and head\n\nas a result of the two beatings.         The IJ suggested that photographs\n\nof them should be submitted so it would be in the record, but\n\ndeclined to make a closer firsthand examination of the scars.            The\n\nrecord shows the IJ had a clear view of petitioner during the\n\nhearing.\n\n            In December 1998, members of the Hezbollah went to\n\nAlbathani's sister's house and told her \"if he stays over here he\n\nshould consider death for himself.          The first time he was able to\n\nrun away, but now it's going to be death for him.\"                  Shortly\n\nthereafter, he looked for help to leave Lebanon.                The message\n\ntriggered his flight to the United States in January 1999.\n\n            During   the   period   of    the   incidents,   Albathani   left\n\nLebanon twice: once to Syria for two days, and once to Cyprus for\n\ntwo days.     He returned to Lebanon each time.         While in Cyprus in\n\nNovember 1998, he filled out a visa application, which contained\n\nfalsehoods.    During the hearing before the IJ, he explained the\n\nfalsehoods by saying that someone else, possibly his brother,\n\nfilled out the application; he just signed it.\n\n            The IJ rendered an oral decision the same day as the\n\nhearing.    She rejected Albathani's claim for relief under the\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\fConvention Against Torture because he had not shown injury at the\n\nhands of the government. She also rejected Albathani's application\n\nfor   asylum     and    withholding        of   deportation.             The      IJ    found\n\nAlbathani's      testimony     not    credible,        noted      that       he   ran    into\n\ndifficulty with Hezbollah only when he drove the road to his\n\nparents' house, credited that he had been robbed but observed that\n\nhis brother (who was with him during the incident) was neither\n\nharmed nor robbed, and commented that Albathani had returned to\n\nLebanon from Cyprus after the incidents.\n\n           The IJ found Albathani's testimony not credible for a\n\nnumber of reasons.           The details of the incidents varied from\n\ntelling to telling, and there were internal contradictions in his\n\naccount.    For example, he claimed at the asylum hearing to be\n\nunconscious    after     the   1998    beating,        but    said      in    the      earlier\n\ninterview that he and his brother had been slapped and their money\n\ntaken, they were forced into the trunk of a car, and driven to a\n\n\"dark   place\"    and    left.       Not    only      did    he   not    mention         being\n\nunconscious,      he    even   described        the    place      he     was      confined.\n\nMoreover, in the later account, Albathani said that his brother was\n\nunharmed, not placed in the trunk of a car, and did not have\n\nanything stolen from him.            The IJ concluded that this, and other\n\ninconsistencies, were material differences that made Albathani a\n\n\"less than credible witness.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f            The   IJ   also   noted   that     Albathani     had   not   produced\n\ncorroborative evidence in the form of testimony by relatives who\n\nwere in the United States. His mother lived in Boston and recently\n\nhad become an American citizen, but, for whatever reason, had left\n\nthe country two weeks before the scheduled hearing before the IJ.\n\nShe might have confirmed his testimony that she was at his hospital\n\nbedside after the 1998 incident.             He also had an uncle in Boston\n\nand his brother and cousin lived in the United States, none of whom\n\ntestified on his behalf.\n\n            The IJ cited Albathani's abuse of immigration procedures,\n\nboth   in   filling     out   the     application      for    a    tourist   visa\n\nfraudulently, and in not filing for admission to the United States\n\nas a refugee from persecution at the United States Embassy in\n\nCyprus.     See generally 8 U.S.C. ยง 1158 (2000)(describing normal\n\nasylum procedures).\n\n            The IJ also questioned whether the attacks were motivated\n\nby political reasons, noting that Albathani was robbed on both\n\noccasions, and deprived of not one but two Mercedes.                He also lost\n\na large amount of money -- $1,200 by his own account in one\n\nincident -- and gold jewelry.         She concluded, \"At least one of the\n\nmotives of the person stopping the car clearly appears to be\n\nrobbery.\"\n\n            Finally,    the   IJ    surmised    that   Albathani     could   have\n\navoided further incidents by relocation, either by leaving Lebanon,\n\n\n                                      -12-\n\for by changing his behavior. She cited Albathani's visits to Syria\n\nand Cyprus as evidence of his ability to avoid persecution without\n\nseeking   asylum    in   the   United    States.       She   concluded   that\n\nAlbathani's \"goal was to come to the United States,\" not to avoid\n\npersecution.     The IJ also focused on the fact that both incidents\n\ntook place in a single location -- the road between Beirut and Deir\n\nEl-Ahmar.     She suggested that Albathani could have avoided the\n\nproblem in Lebanon by seeking alternative routes or means of\n\ntransportation to his parents' home.\n\n            In sum, the IJ concluded that Albathani had not shown a\n\ncredible fear of persecution on one of the statutory grounds for\n\nasylum.     Because he failed to meet the test for asylum, he could\n\nnot meet the more stringent test for withholding of removal.               He\n\nalso was not entitled to relief under Article 3 of the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture as he had not shown he had been tortured at the\n\nhands of the government.3        The IJ ordered him deported from the\n\nUnited States.     Albathani appealed the IJ's decision to the BIA on\n\nOctober   28,   2000.    On    April    9,   2002,   utilizing   the   summary\n\n\n\n\n     3\n        The Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or\nDegrading Treatment or Punishment, Dec. 10, 1984, 1465 U.N.T.S. 85,\nwas implemented in the United States by the Foreign Affairs Reform\nand Restructuring Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-277, ยง 2242, 112\nStat. 2681-761 (codified at 8 U.S.C. ยง 1231 (2000)). Article 3\nprohibits states from returning individuals to other states where\nthere are substantial grounds for believing they would be subject\nto torture.\n\n                                   -13-\n\faffirmance procedure, the BIA affirmed without opinion the results\n\nof the IJ's decision.\n\n                                          II.\n\n            Petitioner characterizes his challenge of the IJ/BIA\n\ndecision as being on due process grounds.                        He does not directly\n\nraise a claim that the decision is not supported by substantial\n\nevidence,    but    asserts     instead         that       the   decision      improperly\n\noverlooked evidence, that the judge improperly hurried the hearing\n\nalong, and that she berated the interpreter.                     The first ground is,\n\nin our view, just a variation on a substantial evidence challenge,\n\nand so we apply the usual substantial evidence standard.

See 8 C.F.R. ยง 208.13(b).        We assume\n\narguendo that membership in the Lebanese Forces satisfies the\n\n\"particular social group or political opinion\" categories.                 The\n\ndifficulty for Albathani is that the IJ did not find him credible\n\non these claims.    Accepting that he had been robbed and beaten by\n\nHezbollah, the IJ did not find this to be persecution based on one\n\nof the five categories.     The record provides adequate reason for\n\ndoubt.   The two incidents on the road may well have been, as the IJ\n\nsuggested, nothing more than the robbery of someone driving a\n\nMercedes with cash in his pocket.       The IJ thought Albathani's fear\n\nof persecution was undercut by his twice returning to Lebanon after\n\ntrips abroad.\n\n           It is true that the IJ did not specifically comment on\n\nhis evidence -- a significant omission -- that Hezbollah later\n\nvisited his sister's house and threatened him, and that this visit\n\nled him to seek refuge in the United States.           But there was reason\n\nto doubt the event occurred; only Albathani's word established it,\n\nand there was a conspicuous lack of corroborating evidence from his\n\nfamily members in America.       This is not an instance of the INS\n\n\n                                     -17-\n\fimproperly   insisting     on   evidence    that    was    not     likely    to    be\n\navailable to a refugee.         See, e.g., Gailius, 147 F.3d at 45-46.\n\nThere is nothing in the record to establish that Albathani was\n\ndenied   communication     with    his    family    in    America.          He    was\n\nrepresented by counsel, and his cousin was present at one hearing\n\nwith him.    Indeed, Albathani was living with his brother in New\n\nHampshire at the time of the hearing, and his aunt was present at\n\nan earlier hearing.      He was also in contact with his older brother,\n\nthen in Brazil, who had been in the Lebanese Forces and could have\n\ncorroborated much of his story.\n\n            Petitioner    argues   that    the     IJ    ignored    evidence       of\n\nAlbathani's limited capacities in making her decision.                 We do not\n\nfind support for this.      The IJ's decision acknowledges Albathani's\n\nlimited education (he left school at 15) and claim that he had head\n\n\"trouble\" since his beatings in her decision. His inarticulateness\n\nat the hearing was recognized by both the IJ and his own counsel.\n\nThe IJ also noted Albathani's tendency to \"fluctuate\" on dates\n\nduring the hearing, but did not rely on such changes in her\n\ndecision.    For example, during the hearing Albathani initially\n\ntestified that his travel to Syria took place in 1999, even though\n\nhe had already left for the United States by that date.                     He also\n\ndemonstrated a tendency to agree with whatever assertion was put to\n\nhim. During cross-examination, Albathani said that during his trip\n\nto Syria, he had received passport stamps from both the Syrian and\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fLebanese border guards, testimony which was belied by his passport.\n\nThe IJ took these limitations into account, commenting during the\n\nhearing that she did not \"hold [his inarticulateness] against him.\"\n\n          Albathani's inconsistency problems go well beyond mere\n\nfluctuations.       He showed a pattern of embellishing his story. In\n\neach context, Albathani added a new incident.                            He originally\n\ndescribed a single beating (the 1998 one) in his credible fear\n\ninterview.      He    did    not     mention      at       that   time    that   he     was\n\nhospitalized    as    a     result    of       this    beating.          Then,   in    his\n\napplication,    Albathani      added       a    1996       incident,     complete      with\n\nhospitalization and a coma, as well as expanding the later incident\n\nto include almost a week's hospitalization. At the hearing itself,\n\nAlbathani mentioned for the first time a second incident in 1998,\n\nthe December threat delivered to his sister.                      Given this pattern,\n\nwe find adequate support for the IJ's reservations regarding\n\nAlbathani's credibility.\n\n             As petitioner points out, some instances in the record\n\nsupport his credibility. One example is his correct identification\n\nof a Lebanese Forces commander.                It is also true that the IJ did\n\nnot explicitly discuss the Country Conditions Report for Lebanon,\n\nadmitted into evidence, other than as useful background.                              These\n\nReports provide some support for Albathani's claimed fear of\n\nkidnapping    and    murder.       Hezbollah          is   reported      to   detain    and\n\nmistreat prisoners from groups to which it is opposed.

But these Reports would not have straightened out the\n\ninconsistencies in Albathani's own stories.\n\n             On our review of the entire record, we do not find\n\nevidence sufficient to compel reversal of the denial of Albathani's\n\nasylum claim.5     He, a fortiori, fails to satisfy the standard for\n\nwithholding of deportation.

Once the case was\n\nselected by the Chairman, one-member review was permissible where\n\nthe Board member found that the case fit certain criteria:\n\n          (ii) The single Board Member to whom a case is assigned\n          may affirm the decision of the Service or the Immigration\n          Judge, without opinion, if the Board Member determines\n          that the result reached in the decision under review was\n          correct; that any errors in the decision under review\n          were harmless or nonmaterial; and that\n\n\n\n      7\n         The September 25, 2002 amendment to the regulations\nrestructured this section.

In February 2002, the Attorney General proposed new\nrules that would, inter alia, increase the range of cases that\ncould be reviewed under AWO procedure, and reduce the Board from 23\nmembers to 11 members.      The intent of the new rules was to\neliminate the backlog of pending cases by reducing the amount of\ntime allotted to each one. Since these new rules did not go into\neffect until September 2002, amici argue they had an immediate\nimpact by causing Board members who wished to retain their jobs to\nhurry through as many AWO cases as possible. Albathani's case,\namici argue, was heard under the 1999 regulations, but as part of\na rush to meet new expectations. Nonetheless, this appeal only\nconcerns the 1999 regulations under which his case was decided.\n\n                                -24-\n\f            Promulgation of the AWO regulations is within the power\n\nof the INS.9    \"[A]dministrative agencies should be free to fashion\n\ntheir own rules of procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry\n\ncapable    of   permitting   them    to    discharge      their   multitudinous\n\nduties.\"    Vt.

Indeed, the Ninth Circuit is already projecting a dramatic\nthree-fold increase in the number of immigration appeals since\n2001. See L. Getter & J. Peterson, Speedier Rate of Deportation\nRulings Assailed, L.A. Times, Jan. 5, 2003, at A1. The highly-\nexpedited nature of the review may prompt even more appeals to the\ncourts.

But both overlook the plain language of Chenery,\n\nwhich   refers   to   agencies    in    their   entirety,    not   individual\n\ncomponents of agencies.       Here, the relevant agency -- the INS --\n\nhas presented a statement of reasons for its decision, albeit from\n\nthe IJ rather than the BIA.         Chenery does not require that this\n\nstatement come from the BIA rather than the IJ.\n\n           The BIA can adopt, without further explication, the IJ's\n\nopinion.   See Chen v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196819\"><a href=\"/opinion/196819/feng-chen-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">87</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">5</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 8 (1st Cir. 1996) (\"[W]e join\n\neight of our sister circuits in ruling that the Board need not\n\nwrite at length merely to repeat the IJ's findings of fact and his\n\nreasons for denying the requested relief, but, rather, having given\n\nindividualized consideration to a particular case, may simply state\n\nthat it affirms the IJ's decision for the reasons set forth in that\n\ndecision.\") (listing cases).\n\n           The   contention      here    is   that   the   AWO   procedure    is\n\ndistinguishable from Chen because it permits affirmance without\n\nopinion even when the BIA disagrees with the IJ's reasoning.                 The\n\nAWO regulation does indeed allow such an affirmance.               Because the\n\nsummary affirmance is only of the \"result\" and not the reasoning,\n\nthis means that courts of appeals are forced to review a decision\n\nwhich may or may not contain the reasoning of the BIA.              The court\n\n\n                                       -26-\n\fthus reviews the BIA decision without knowing its basis.            The\n\nsummary affirmance scheme does create these problems, but they do\n\nnot render the scheme a violation of due process or render judicial\n\nreview impossible.    Nor does the scheme violate any statute.\n\n          The courts will continue to have the IJ's decision and\n\nthe record upon which it is based available for review.        See also\n\n8 U.S.C. ยง 1252(b)(4)(A) (\"[T]he court of Appeals shall decide the\n\npetition only on the administrative record on which the order of\n\nremoval is based.\").        This permits a court to carry out an\n\nintelligent review.\n\n          In functional terms, if the BIA does not independently\n\nstate a correct ground for affirmance in a case in which the\n\nreasoning proffered by the IJ is faulty, the BIA risks reversal on\n\nappeal.    One   of   the   several     justifications   for   Chenery's\n\nrequirement for explicit reasons derives from a limitation on the\n\ncourts' ability to substitute different grounds.         \"[A] reviewing\n\ncourt . . . must judge the propriety of such action solely by the\n\ngrounds invoked by the agency.

Ordinarily, the case will\n\nbe remanded to the agency, and the agency will not, in the end,\n\nhave saved any time or effort.\n\n               The more serious argument is that the very nature of the\n\none-line summary affirmance may mean that BIA members are not in\n\nfact engaged in the review required by regulation and courts will\n\nnot be able to tell.            Immigration decisions, especially in asylum\n\ncases, may have life or death consequences, and so the costs of\n\nerror are very high.              Amici point out that this fear is not\n\nabstract in light of the huge caseload faced by only 19 BIA\n\nmembers.       For example, the Board member who denied Albathani's\n\nappeal is recorded as having decided over 50 cases on October 31,\n\n2002, a rate of one every ten minutes over the course of a nine-\n\nhour    day.

In general, even when the IJ decides\n\nthe alien is not credible, there must be review of the record\n\n\n       10\n        Albathani argues that this very rule proves his point --\nthe court should know the true reasons for the BIA's action.

But our review\n\nhere confirms that if there were any deviation from what the\n\nregulations required of the single BIA member (and there is no\n\nreason to think there is any), then the error would be harmless.\n\nThere was a basis for affirmance and for summary affirmance.\n\n          Were there evidence of systemic violation by the BIA of\n\nits regulations, this would be a different case.     We would then\n\nhave to face, inter alia, the INS's claim that the decision to\n\nstreamline an immigration appeal is not reviewable by the courts\n\nbecause these are matters committed to agency discretion.

We\n\nare not willing, however, in the absence of such evidence, to infer\n\nfrom these numbers alone that the required review is not taking\n\n\n                               -29-\n\fplace.   Courts themselves use \"summary affirmance\" or \"summary\n\ndisposition\" procedures in which parties may receive one-line\n\ndispositions of their appeals.   See, e.g., 1st Cir. R. 27.1.   These\n\nare workload management devices that acknowledge the reality of\n\nhigh caseloads.   They do not, either alone or in combination with\n\ncaseload statistics, establish that the required review is not\n\ntaking place.\n\n          For these reasons, the challenges to the AWO procedure\n\nare rejected.\n\n                                  V.\n\n          The decision of the BIA is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -30-\n\f</pre>",
