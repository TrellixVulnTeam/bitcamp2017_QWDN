Rya W. Zobel,    U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                         Lynch, Chief Judge,\n\n                  Boudin and Lipez, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Kevin J. Reddington for appellant.\n     Sara Miron Bloom, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nMichael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           October 8, 2008\n\f          BOUDIN, Circuit Judge.     Rafael Vasquez appeals from his\n\nconviction for drug and gun offenses.        Based on evidence at the\n\nsuppression hearing and trial, a brief sketch of the background\n\nevents is as follows.\n\n          On December 13, 2005, acting on a tip regarding a likely\n\ndrug delivery, police officers stopped a car near the parking lot\n\nof a restaurant in Fall River, Massachusetts, and ordered the\n\noccupants to exit.    As Vasquez exited from the passenger side, he\n\ntold the officers that he had a gun, which they took from him.         The\n\nfemale driver, exiting from the other side, dropped a plastic bag\n\nseemingly containing drugs; and Vasquez shouted that the crack\n\nbelonged to him and that the driver had nothing to do with it.\n\n          Vasquez was charged with possession of cocaine base with\n\nintent to distribute, 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1) (2000), possession of\n\na firearm in relation to a crime of drug trafficking, 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c)(1)(A) (2000), and being a felon in possession of a firearm\n\nand ammunition, 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (2000).        A jury convicted\n\nVasquez on all three counts, and he was sentenced to concurrent\n\nfive year terms for the first and third offenses, and a consecutive\n\nfive years for the second offense, as required by 18 U.S.C. §\n\n924(c)(1)(A).   This appeal followed.\n\n          Vasquez's   principal   argument   on   appeal   is   that   the\n\ndistrict court should have suppressed his statements acknowledging\n\nthat the drugs were his, his admission that he possessed the gun\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\fand the gun itself. He says that no reasonable suspicion justified\n\na stop of the car, nor did probable cause exist to warrant what he\n\ncharacterizes as a de facto arrest.               Following a suppression\n\nhearing prior to trial, the judge had refused to suppress the\n\nevidence, finding that a reliable informant's tip and the officers’\n\nobservation of suspicious activity during surveillance provided\n\nadequate justification for the officers’ actions.\n\n            The district judge credited the testimony of Detective\n\nJacob, who testified at the suppression hearing as to the origin of\n\nthe tip; that finding is reviewed only for clear error,1 and\n\nVasquez does not contest it.         Jacob said that the tip was received\n\nby   an   informant;   that    the    informant    had   provided   reliable\n\ninformation to him personally as to drug deals in August, September\n\nand October 2005; and in each instance a search warrant issued and\n\nthe suspects were convicted.\n\n            The district court also ruled that although the informant\n\nhad himself been arraigned in early September 2005 for forgery and\n\nwriting   false   checks,     he   remained   \"clearly    reliable\"   as   an\n\ninformant, two of the three earlier tips having been furnished\n\n\n\n      1\n      United States v. Jones, 523 F.3d 31, 36 (1st Cir. 2008)\n(\"When considering challenges to a district court's denial of a\nmotion to suppress, we ordinarily review findings of fact for clear\nerror and conclusions of law de novo.\"); United States v.\nCunningham, 201 F.3d 20, 28 (1st Cir. 2000) (\"[I]n absence of clear\nerror, credibility assessments 'are exclusively within the province\nof the sentencing court.'\") (quoting United States v. Olivier-Diaz,\n13 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1993))).\n\n                                      -3-\n\fafter   the    arraignment.         A    sufficiently      specific     tip    from   an\n\ninformant of proven reliability can establish probable cause for an\n\narrest, not merely a Terry stop.                United States v. Link, 238 F.3d\n\n106,    109-10   (1st   Cir.    2001).           Given   his    accurate   tips,      the\n\ninformant's own criminal background did not prevent the police from\n\nreasonably relying upon his information.                       See United States v.\n\nBrown, 500 F.3d 48, 54-56 (1st Cir. 2007).\n\n              Further, the informant had said that a Hispanic man named\n\n\"Raffe\"--about 30 years old with black hair--would be driven by a\n\nfemale driver in a white Toyota Corolla to the parking lot in order\n\nto deliver a package of crack cocaine.               Just before the arrest, the\n\ndefendant had entered the parking lot in a white Toyota Corolla,\n\ndriven by a woman.          This, of course, tended to \"corroborate that\n\ncertain      events   had   taken       place    exactly   as     the   [confidential\n\ninformant] had predicted.\"              Brown, 500 F.3d at 56.\n\n              Finally, the police testified that the car's driving\n\npattern was unusual: the car drove slowly around the parking lot as\n\nVasquez and the driver peered into the parked cars, the car exited\n\nthe    lot    without   stopping,         drove    onto    a    highway,      and   then\n\nimmediately turned off it and returned to the street next to the\n\nparking lot.     It was at this point that the police, now having more\n\nthan ample probable cause, halted the car, ordered the passengers\n\nout and secured the gun and drugs.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -4-\n\f             Vasquez makes several other preserved arguments, but none\n\nrequires much comment.          The district court refused to dismiss a\n\njuror who said that he supported gun control laws but could be\n\nimpartial.    Such rulings are reviewed for abuse of discretion, see\n\nUnited States v. Martí-Lón, 524 F.3d 295, 300 (1st Cir. 2008), and\n\nthere   is   no    indication   of    any        such   abuse   in   this    instance.\n\nFurther, the juror turned out to be an alternate and was dismissed\n\nbefore deliberations began.\n\n             Vasquez also says that the evidence was insufficient to\n\nshow that the gun he surrendered at his arrest was carried during\n\nand in relation to a drug trafficking crime. Although the argument\n\nwas preserved by motion for acquittal, Vasquez clearly brought the\n\ngun to the scene with the drugs, and the jury was entitled to\n\nconclude that the gun had sufficient \"potential of facilitating\"\n\nthe drug trafficking offense for which Vasquez was convicted.\n\nSmith v. United States, 508 U.S. 223, 238 (1993) (quoting United\n\nStates v. Stewart, 779 F.2d 538, 540 (9th Cir. 1985)).                      No more is\n\nrequired.\n\n             The remaining claims of error--for example, challenging\n\nsupposed errors in the jury instructions--were not preserved.                      We\n\nhave    examined    each   under     the    demanding      plain     error   standard\n\napplicable in such cases, United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725\n\n(1993), but find that none even comes close.                    Defense counsel on\n\nappeal is entitled to search the record for such unpreserved claims\n\n\n                                           -5-\n\fand call such claims to our attention, but they do not in this\n\ninstance warrant separate discussion.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f",
