Norwood, Senior Litigation Counsel, on brief for respondent.\n\n\n\n\n                             August 25, 2006\n\f            Per Curiam. Manash Ali, a native of Pakistan and citizen\n\nof Bangladesh, petitions for review of a final order of the Board\n\nof Immigration Appeals affirming an immigration judge's decision to\n\ndeny his applications for asylum, withholding of removal, and\n\nrelief under the Convention Against Torture (CAT).            We deny the\n\npetition.\n\n            Ali testified at his asylum hearing that he was raised in\n\nBangladesh, where he and his family were active members of the\n\nJatiya political party.     Ali was involved in recruiting new party\n\nmembers, attended political meetings, and went to demonstrations\n\nwith his father, a local party leader.       In 1986, Ali's father ran\n\nfor a seat in the Bangladeshi Parliament.        Though his father was\n\nnot elected, his mother served as a \"selected woman\" member of\n\nParliament from 1986 to 1990.      Also during that time, Ali's uncle\n\nwas an information minister for the government.\n\n            In   1989,   there   was   significant   social    unrest   in\n\nBangladesh due to a power struggle among the Jatiya Party (which\n\nwas then in power), the Bangladesh National Party (BNP), and the\n\nAwami League. During this period, the Bangladeshi police protected\n\nthe Ali family home.     In June, while traveling by car with several\n\nother members of the Jatiya Party, Ali passed through a BNP\n\ndemonstration.     The demonstrators pulled Ali out of the car and\n\nbeat him with rocks and sticks.          Ali thereafter applied for a\n\nstudent visa.    Over a year later, in September 1990, Ali obtained\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fthe visa and entered the United States.   The visa authorized him to\n\nremain in the country only until June 1995, but he never left.\n\n          The BNP came into power in 1990.   Late in 1992, police in\n\nBangladesh issued a warrant for Ali's arrest.     Ali believes that\n\nthe arrest warrant was motivated by his ties to the Jatiya Party,\n\nas most members of the party, including his younger brother and\n\nuncle, were served with arrest warrants.     According to Ali, his\n\nbrother and uncle were imprisoned, beaten, and denied food, clean\n\nwater, and adequate sleeping conditions.        Ali testified that\n\nshortly after his parents were served with his arrest warrant, he\n\nfiled an application for political asylum and withholding of\n\nremoval with the Immigration and Naturalization Service.1      Even\n\nthough his warrant was served over a decade ago, Ali claims\n\ngovernmental officials continue to look for him.\n\n          In July 2002, removal proceedings were commenced against\n\nAli for overstaying his visa.   Conceding removability, Ali renewed\n\nhis requests for asylum and withholding of removal, and added a new\n\nrequest for relief under the CAT.\n\n          Following a hearing, the immigration judge denied these\n\nrequests in an order that characterized Ali's testimony as \"general\n\nand meager and unconvincing,\" and that found that the alleged\n\n\n\n     1\n      In March 2003, the functions of the INS were transferred to\nthe new Department of Homeland Security. See Homeland Security Act\nof 2002, Pub. L. No. 107-296, § 471, 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified\nas amended at 6 U.S.C. § 291(a)).\n\n                                -3-\n\fbeating in 1989 did not rise to the level of persecution.                            The\n\njudge also rejected Ali's assertion of a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution, questioning the authenticity of the proffered\n\narrest warrant as an original or authenticated copy because it\n\ncontained    the     notation      \"signature     illegible\"     rather       than    a\n\nsignature, illegible or not.             The judge also disbelieved Ali's\n\ncontention    that       the   warrant   caused    him   to    file     the    asylum\n\napplication, in view of the fact that the application was filed\n\nmore than eight months prior to the date of the warrant.                  Moreover,\n\nthe judge found no reason to believe that the warrant had been\n\nissued because of Ali's political affiliation.                Finally, the judge\n\nfound no evidence establishing that any government official of\n\nBangladesh was seeking to torture Ali.               In lieu of removal, the\n\njudge granted Ali voluntary departure.             The Board affirmed without\n\nopinion.\n\n            Where the Board summarily adopts the immigration judge's\n\ndecision, we review the reasoning of the immigration judge.                         See\n\nChen v. Gonzales, 418 F.3d 110, 113 (1st Cir. 2005).                    A denial of\n\nasylum must stand unless \"the petitioner's evidence would compel a\n\nreasonable factfinder to conclude that relief was warranted.\"\n\nSettenda v. Ashcroft, 377 F.3d 89, 93 (1st Cir. 2004).                   Therefore,\n\nwe will uphold the immigration judge's determinations so long as\n\nthey are \"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative\n\nevidence     on    the    record    considered     as    a    whole.\"         INS     v.\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fElias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            Eligibility for asylum requires proof of \"persecution or\n\na well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\nopinion.\"   8 U.S.C. §§ 1101(a)(42)(A), 1158(b)(1).               Applicants can\n\nsatisfy that burden either by proving past persecution or a well-\n\nfounded fear of persecution that is both subjectively genuine and\n\nobjectively reasonable.       See Ang v. Gonzales, 430 F.3d 50, 57 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).\n\n            Ali asserts that his testimony should be deemed credible\n\nand that he provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate both past\n\npersecution and a well-founded fear of future persecution. He also\n\nargues that he should have been granted withholding of removal or\n\nrelief under CAT.\n\n            Ali   testified     to    a     single     incident     of   alleged\n\npersecution: his beating in 1989 by a group of BNP demonstrators.\n\nEvidence of a single encounter is ordinarily not sufficient to\n\nestablish persecution, particularly where, as here, the applicant\n\nremained in the country for a significant period of time following\n\nthe incident.     See Topalli v. Gonzales, 417 F.3d 128, 132 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (differentiating \"systematic treatment that rose to the level\n\nof   past   persecution\"   from      \"isolated       incidents\");    Bocova   v.\n\nGonzales, 412 F.3d 257, 263 (1st Cir. 2005) (\"[M]istreatment\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fordinarily   must   entail   more   than   sporadic   abuse   in   order    to\n\nconstitute persecution.\"). Just as importantly, Ali provided scant\n\nevidence linking this incident to his political beliefs.              Other\n\nthan his own conclusory and unexplained testimony that the BNP\n\ndemonstrators recognized him, among six occupants of a vehicle, as\n\na member of the Jatiya Party, Ali did not offer any evidence that\n\nthe beating was motivated by his political affiliation.                    See\n\nRomilus v. Ashcroft, 385 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2004) (holding that an\n\nasylum applicant is required to \"provide some evidence of\" his\n\npersecutor's motivations) (quoting Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at\n\n483).    Vague and unsubstantiated testimony does not compel a\n\nconclusion that Ali was persecuted because of his politics.                See\n\nAguilar-Solis v. INS, 168 F.3d 565, 571 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          Ali also failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution based on his political beliefs. Even assuming that the\n\nproffered arrest warrant is authentic, there is no evidence that it\n\nwas issued because of Ali's political affiliation or that Ali would\n\nbe unfairly prosecuted.2     See Ngure v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 975, 991\n\n(8th Cir. 2004) (\"Criminal prosecution for violation of a fairly\n\nadministered law does not constitute persecution.\").\n\n          Likewise, the immigration judge was not compelled to find\n\na well-founded fear on the basis of Ali's testimony regarding the\n\n\n     2\n      Ali acknowledged that the warrant charges him with violations\nof the Bangladesh Penal Code, but he did not provide information\nconcerning specifically what crimes he allegedly committed.\n\n                                    -6-\n\farrest and imprisonment of his uncle and brother.          Again, there is\n\nno evidence, apart from Ali's conclusory statements, that their\n\npolitical   beliefs   triggered    their   arrests   and   their   alleged\n\nmistreatment.3    Ali admitted that his brother and his uncle were\n\nfreed from prison years ago, and that they, along with Ali's\n\nparents, currently reside safely in Bangladesh.             Indeed, Ali's\n\nmother and brother work at a school that is registered with the\n\ngovernment of Bangladesh. Finally, the United States Department of\n\nState Country Reports undercut Ali's claims.         They indicate that\n\nthe international community deemed the 2001 elections in Bangladesh\n\nfair and free, and that Bangladesh is now governed by a four-party\n\nalliance which includes the Jatiya Party.\n\n            Because Ali has not satisfied the standard for asylum, he\n\ncannot not meet the more stringent standard for withholding of\n\nremoval. See Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, 398 F.3d 120, 123 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).    Ali's claim for entitlement to relief under the CAT\n\nalso fails. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish, by\n\nspecific objective evidence, that it is \"more likely than not\" that\n\nhe will be tortured by or with the consent or acquiescence of a\n\npublic official upon his return to the proposed country of removal.\n\nSee Romilus, 385 F.3d at 8.       The immigration judge properly found\n\nthat Ali had offered no evidence establishing that anyone in\n\n\n     3\n      Given the existence of several internal inconsistencies and\nimplausibilities in Ali's testimony overall, we cannot fault the\nimmigration judge for viewing that testimony with skepticism.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fBangladesh, much less a government official, is seeking to torture\n\nhim.4\n\n            The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n      Ali also argues that he should have been granted asylum as a\nmatter of discretion. Because Ali failed to present this argument\nto the Board, we will not consider it. See Opere v. INS, 267 F.3d\n10, 14 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n                                 -8-\n\f",

Just as importantly, Ali provided scant\n\nevidence linking this incident to his political beliefs.              Other\n\nthan his own conclusory and unexplained testimony that the BNP\n\ndemonstrators recognized him, among six occupants of a vehicle, as\n\na member of the Jatiya Party, Ali did not offer any evidence that\n\nthe beating was motivated by his political affiliation.                    See\n\nRomilus v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201241\"><a href=\"/opinion/201241/romilus-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">385</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 7 (1st Cir. 2004) (holding that an\n\nasylum applicant is required to \"provide some evidence of\" his\n\npersecutor's motivations) (quoting Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. at\n\n483).    Vague and unsubstantiated testimony does not compel a\n\nconclusion that Ali was persecuted because of his politics.                See\n\nAguilar-Solis v. INS, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198342\"><a href=\"/opinion/198342/aguilar-solis-v-ins/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 571 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n          Ali also failed to demonstrate a well-founded fear of\n\npersecution based on his political beliefs. Even assuming that the\n\nproffered arrest warrant is authentic, there is no evidence that it\n\nwas issued because of Ali's political affiliation or that Ali would\n\nbe unfairly prosecuted.2     See Ngure v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"786130\"><a href=\"/opinion/786130/joseph-ngure-v-john-d-ashcroft-attorney-general-of-the-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">367</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 991\n\n(8th Cir. 2004) (\"Criminal prosecution for violation of a fairly\n\nadministered law does not constitute persecution.\").\n\n          Likewise, the immigration judge was not compelled to find\n\na well-founded fear on the basis of Ali's testimony regarding the\n\n\n     2\n      Ali acknowledged that the warrant charges him with violations\nof the Bangladesh Penal Code, but he did not provide information\nconcerning specifically what crimes he allegedly committed.\n\n                                    -6-\n\farrest and imprisonment of his uncle and brother.          Again, there is\n\nno evidence, apart from Ali's conclusory statements, that their\n\npolitical   beliefs   triggered    their   arrests   and   their   alleged\n\nmistreatment.3    Ali admitted that his brother and his uncle were\n\nfreed from prison years ago, and that they, along with Ali's\n\nparents, currently reside safely in Bangladesh.             Indeed, Ali's\n\nmother and brother work at a school that is registered with the\n\ngovernment of Bangladesh. Finally, the United States Department of\n\nState Country Reports undercut Ali's claims.         They indicate that\n\nthe international community deemed the 2001 elections in Bangladesh\n\nfair and free, and that Bangladesh is now governed by a four-party\n\nalliance which includes the Jatiya Party.\n\n            Because Ali has not satisfied the standard for asylum, he\n\ncannot not meet the more stringent standard for withholding of\n\nremoval. See Rodriguez-Ramirez v. Ashcroft, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201454\"><a href=\"/opinion/201454/rodriguez-ramirez-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">398</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">120</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 123 (1st\n\nCir. 2005).    Ali's claim for entitlement to relief under the CAT\n\nalso fails. To obtain such relief, an applicant must establish, by\n\nspecific objective evidence, that it is \"more likely than not\" that\n\nhe will be tortured by or with the consent or acquiescence of a\n\npublic official upon his return to the proposed country of removal.\n\nSee Romilus, 385 F.3d at 8.       The immigration judge properly found\n\nthat Ali had offered no evidence establishing that anyone in\n\n\n     3\n      Given the existence of several internal inconsistencies and\nimplausibilities in Ali's testimony overall, we cannot fault the\nimmigration judge for viewing that testimony with skepticism.\n\n                                    -7-\n\fBangladesh, much less a government official, is seeking to torture\n\nhim.4\n\n            The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n        4\n      Ali also argues that he should have been granted asylum as a\nmatter of discretion. Because Ali failed to present this argument\nto the Board, we will not consider it. See Opere v.
