Walter F. and Sarah O.\n\nSorenson, appeal the dismissal of their action for damages against\n\nH & R Block, Inc. and others (collectively “Block”).   Our review of\n\nthe issues raised by the Sorensons on appeal discloses no error,\n\nand we affirm.\n\n          Mr. Sorenson, an airline pilot who also owns a small\n\nbusiness, used Block to prepare his state and federal income tax\n\nreturns for years.    Apparently no problems emerged from this\n\nassociation until preparation of the returns for tax year 1993.\n\nThen, however, disputes arose because Mr. Sorenson insisted on\n\nclaiming certain income tax deductions contrary to Block’s advice.\n\nMr. Sorenson ultimately prevailed and the deductions were made; but\n\nlater he was subjected to audits by the Massachusetts Department of\n\nRevenue (DOR) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).      Although\n\nmatters with the taxing authorities were settled, Mr. Sorenson paid\n\nthe DOR over $8,000 and the IRS over $45,000 in back taxes,\n\ninterest, and penalties for the tax years 1993, 1994, and 1995.\n\n          The Sorensons brought this action against Block seeking\n\n$5 million in damages, asserting claims for negligence; breach of\n\nfiduciary duty; professional malpractice; intentional or negligent\n\ninfliction of emotional distress; breach of contract; breach of the\n\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing; intentional or negligent\n\nmisrepresentation; loss of consortium; and false and deceptive\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\ftrade practices under Massachusetts statutes.1               Plaintiffs and\n\ndefendants both moved for summary judgment.            After a studious and\n\ncareful consideration of all the issues, the district court granted\n\nsummary judgment to Block, except for a specific breach of contract\n\nclaim and a trade practices claim.2          On those, the court granted\n\njudgment to the Sorensons and awarded total damages of $630.\n\n             The genesis of the dispute between the parties occurred\n\non March 3, 1994 during an interview for the purpose of preparing\n\nMr. Sorenson’s      1993   returns.     At   that    meeting,    Mr.   Sorenson\n\ninsisted that he was entitled to claim a deduction from taxable\n\nincome for expenses he incurred in campaigning for local political\n\noffice. He also insisted upon a charitable deduction for left over\n\nfood he had given to a charity when his wedding was cancelled.3\n\n             The   preparer   and   supervisory      personnel   advised    Mr.\n\nSorenson those deductions were improper.            Unwilling to accept that\n\nadvice, Mr. Sorenson called Block’s headquarters to protest. Among\n\nhis complaints was his dissatisfaction with the service he had\n\nreceived from Karl Brandenburg, the district manager under whose\n\ndirection the Sorenson return was being prepared.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Although not an original party to the action, having filed a\nbrief in this court on the discovery issues raised in the district\ncourt, the IRS was added as a party to this appeal.\n     2\n         Sorenson v. H & R Block,Inc., 2002 WL 31194868 (D. Mass.)\n     3\n         Apparently he had no receipts for those donations.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            During that conversation, Mr. Sorenson told Linda Murphy,\n\nMr. Brandenburg’s supervisor, that he was going to a local Block\n\noffice “in an hour” to sign the necessary form to have his return\n\nfiled electronically.        He demanded a resolution from Ms. Murphy of\n\nwhether his campaign expenses were deductible before he signed the\n\ndocument.    Without having received a response to that demand, Mr.\n\nSorenson nonetheless signed the form permitting electronic filing\n\nof his return on March 16, 1994.        The return claimed the deductions\n\nquestioned by Block.\n\n            In July of 1994, the DOR commenced an audit of Mr.\n\nSorenson’s state returns, ultimately determining he had improperly\n\ndeclared a Massachusetts domicile.          Consequently, DOR disallowed\n\ndeductions based on that claim as well as other employee business\n\nexpenses    and   assessed    Mr.   Sorenson   $8,322.93   in   back    taxes,\n\ninterest, and penalties.\n\n            In June 1995, the IRS notified Mr. Sorenson of an audit\n\nof his 1993 federal return.         Mr. Sorenson was instructed to attend\n\na meeting with an auditor and to provide supporting information for\n\ndeductions he had taken including charitable contributions and\n\nemployee expenses.     Mr. Brandenburg accompanied Mr. Sorenson to at\n\nleast two meetings with IRS Agent Paul Lounsbury, the auditor.\n\n            Before the first meeting, Mr. Brandenburg told Agent\n\nLounsbury he knew the reason for the audit and stated he “wished”\n\nhe had the “courage” to report Mr. Sorenson to the IRS.                He also\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fshowed Agent Lounsbury a number of Block’s internal memoranda\n\nconcerning Mr. Sorensons’s 1993 return, including a memo Mr.\n\nBrandenburg had written to Ms. Murphy describing the return as\n\n“Fraud in Capital Letters.”\n\n            At a subsequent meeting, in Mr. Sorenson’s presence,\n\nAgent Lounsbury asked for a paper copy of the 1993 return.                     In\n\nresponse, Mr. Brandenburg handed over a file which contained not\n\nonly the return but also copies of Block’s internal memos and a\n\nletter to Mr. Sorenson that Mr. Brandenburg had prepared but had\n\nnot sent.      The parties agree that at that time, Mr. Sorenson did\n\nnot know those documents were in the file or even existed.                 Whether\n\nMr. Brandenburg knew the Block papers were in the file when he gave\n\nit to Agent Lounsbury is unresolved.\n\n            In late 1996, Mr. Sorenson hired an attorney to represent\n\nhim in the audit process which, by that time, had grown to include\n\ntax years 1992 through 1995.          About a year later, the attorney was\n\ninformed    the   case   had   been    turned   over    to    the   IRS   Criminal\n\nInvestigation Division.        The underlying circumstances behind the\n\ninvestigation were the deductions Mr. Sorenson had claimed on his\n\nreturns and other subsequent actions for which he was responsible.\n\n            Mr. Sorenson had applied for a bank loan in connection\n\nwith his business.         In support of that loan application, he\n\nobtained “amended returns” for 1994 and 1995 which indicated an\n\nincome   for    that   business   substantially        more   than   the    income\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fdisclosed    in    the   returns   he   actually    filed   for   those   years.\n\nAlthough the “amended returns” were used in connection with the\n\nloan application, they were never filed with the IRS.\n\n             After six months, IRS closed the criminal investigation\n\nand returned the Sorenson file for a continuation of the civil\n\naudit.   By then, however, the statute of limitations for recovery\n\nof back taxes for 1992 through 1994 had expired, leaving for\n\npossible recovery by the IRS only the penalties for civil fraud for\n\nthose years.\n\n             Mr. Sorenson ultimately settled with the IRS. In exchange\n\nfor an agreement by the Service not to pursue civil fraud penalties\n\nfor any year, Mr. Sorenson waived the statute of limitations on\n\nordinary assessments for 1994.           He also agreed to pay $46,439 in\n\nback taxes (deemed negligently unpaid) for 1994 and 1995, plus\n\ninterest and non-fraud penalties.\n\n             On the basis of these essential facts, the Sorensons\n\ncontend the district court erred on many issues.             We review a grant\n\nof summary judgment de novo, Douglas v. York County, 360 F.3d 286,\n\n290 (1st Cir. 2004), and, because cross motions for summary judgment\n\nwere filed, we have considered each motion separately and drawn\n\ninferences against each movant in turn.              See Reich v. John Alden\n\nLife Ins. Co., 126 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 1997).                 Employing these\n\nstandards,    we    conclude   none     of    the   Sorensons’    arguments   is\n\npersuasive.\n\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fI.   Fiduciary Responsibility of a Tax Preparer.\n\n            The Sorensons first assert that as a tax preparer, Block\n\nhad a fiduciary responsibility to them which Block breached in\n\nseveral ways.    Although the Sorensons’ counsel admits he has found\n\n“no case in Massachusetts which holds that tax preparers owe a\n\nfiduciary duty to their clients,”4 he nonetheless argues such a\n\nfiduciary duty arises when trust is reposed in one who has “a great\n\ndisparity of knowledge or expertise in a commercial setting.”             He\n\nbuttresses that theory by relying principally upon Green v. H & R\n\nBlock, Inc., 735 A.2d 1039 (Md. 1999) and Basile v. H & R Block,\n\nInc., 761 A.2d 1115 (Pa. 2000), to craft an argument that there is\n\nan agency relationship between a taxpayer and a tax preparer.\n\nCounsel then segues into a contention that the agency relationship\n\ngives rise to a fiduciary responsibility owed to the taxpayer by the\n\npreparer.   As the district court correctly recognized, however, the\n\nrationale is inapposite because it is dependent upon a theory of\n\nagency    recognized   in   Maryland     and   Pennsylvania   but   not   in\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n            As the district court noted, Massachusetts courts have\n\naccepted the Restatement’s view that the essential ingredients of an\n\nagency relationship are: 1) the agent’s power to alter the legal\n\nrelationships between the principal and third parties; 2) a fiduciary\n\nrelationship toward the principal regarding matters within the scope\n\n      4\n      The district court was less equivocal.    It said there is\nnone, and it was not going to break new ground.\n\n                                   -8-\n\fof the agency; and 3) the principal’s right to control the agent’s\n\nconduct in matters within the scope of the agency.         See Thornton v.\n\nHarvard Univ., 2 F. Supp. 2d. 89, 95 (D. Mass. 1998); Sabel v. Mead\n\nJohnson & Co., 737 F. Supp. 135, 138 (D. Mass. 1990) (citing the\n\nRestatement (Second) of Agency §§ 12 -14 (1958)); United States v.\n\nFerber, 266 F. Supp. 90, 100 (D. Mass. 1997).\n\n             The district court concluded two of the three requirements\n\nof an agency relationship between Mr. Sorenson and Block were\n\nunproved. Block did not have the power to alter Mr. Sorensons’ legal\n\nrelationships with others, nor did Mr. Sorenson have the capacity to\n\ncontrol Block’s conduct in the preparation of tax returns.             These\n\nconclusions have patent support in the record.\n\n             Having failed to prove the essential elements of an agency\n\nrelationship, the Sorensons’ basic premise fails, and with it, the\n\ncontention     that   Block   breached    fiduciary   duties.   With    that\n\nconclusion, we do not consider allied arguments they assert.\n\nII.   Compelling Disclosure of IRS Source.\n\n             The Sorensons next argue the district court erred by\n\ndenying their motion to compel the IRS to disclose the name of the\n\nperson who provided the Service with information about Mr. Sorenson’s\n\ntax returns.    They contend the denial of this information “unfairly\n\nprejudiced” them, postulating the disclosure would have permitted\n\nthem to show the court Block “received a benefit from turning in\n\nSorenson.”     With this evidence, they could have proved “additional\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fdamages flowing from this wrongdoing.”              Moreover, the information\n\ncould have “bolster[ed] their claims for breach of contract and\n\nunfair and deceptive business practices at trial.”\n\n             This discovery dispute is governed by a stringent standard\n\nof review.    We will intervene in discovery matters only upon a clear\n\nshowing of manifest injustice, that is, where the lower court’s\n\ndiscovery    order   was   plainly   wrong    and   resulted   in   substantial\n\nprejudice to the aggrieved party.           Faigin v. Kelly, 184 F.3d 67, 84\n\n(1st Cir. 1999); Mack v. Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. Inc., 871\n\nF.2d 179, 186 (1st Cir. 1989).        The Sorensons have failed to clear\n\nthis high hurdle.\n\n             The   District   Director   instructed     IRS    employees   being\n\ndeposed in this case that they could testify about any conversations\n\nwith Block employees pertinent to Mr. Sorenson’s taxes, but they were\n\nnot to disclose any information or records that would reveal a\n\nconfidential source.       Faced with the issue of whether the identity\n\nof the informant was discoverable, the magistrate judge, in an order\n\nlater adopted by the district judge, ruled it was not.                The court\n\nreasoned the issue was governed by the Administrative Procedure Act,\n\n5 U.S.C. § 702, because the government is not a party to this action.\n\n             The APA proscribes overruling any agency action that is\n\nnot “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not\n\nin accordance with law.”          5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).             Viewing the\n\nstatutory prohibition of disclosing “return information” under 26\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fU.S.C. § 6103, and the broad inclusory language of that statute, see\n\nChamberlain v. Kurtz, 589 F.2d 827, 837 (5th Cir. 1979), the court\n\nconcluded the refusal to reveal the identity of the informant did not\n\nrise to the level required for an order compelling disclosure.               That\n\nholding is not plainly wrong.\n\nIII.     Damages.\n\n               The district court concluded Block had a contractual\n\nobligation to keep confidential the contents of Mr. Sorenson’s\n\nreturns, and this obligation was breached for tax year 1993.                    As\n\ndamages, the court awarded the cost of the preparation of those\n\nreturns.       The Sorensons now argue they are entitled to foreseeable\n\nand consequential damages for the penalties and interest Mr. Sorenson\n\nhad to pay, contending under the common law they must be placed in\n\nthe same position they would have occupied had the contract not been\n\nbreached.\n\n               The district court held there is “no basis under any\n\ntheory    of    recovery   to   shift   responsibility     for   the   amount   of\n\nSorenson’s unpaid back taxes.           These are Sorenson’s responsibility,\n\nhowever they came to be discovered.              And, absent some contractual\n\nobligation, I decline to permit recovery of interest and penalties\n\nas well.”      (emphasis in original).         We see no error in this holding.\n\nMoreover, Sorensons’ proof was inadequate to show              causation between\n\nBlock’s         actions         and     those        claimed      damages.\n\n               The Sorensons also argue the district court erred by\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fgranting summary judgment to Block on the Sorensons’ claim of damages\n\nfor unauthorized disclosure of information prior to the filing of the\n\n1993   return.    They   argue   the    evidence   “strongly   supports   the\n\ninference that a Block employee turned in Sorenson.”             They do not\n\nstate what other damages resulted from this alleged breach but\n\ncontend only they should have been able to go to trial on the\n\ninference.    The district court held there was no evidence to support\n\nthe claim of breach and refused to award preparation fees for 1991,\n\n1992, 1994, and 1995.        Again, this holding is supported by the\n\nrecord.\n\n             The Sorensons also maintain the district court erred by\n\ndenying   them   emotional   distress    damages,   contending    there    are\n\nunresolved material issues of fact applicable to that claim.              They\n\nargue additional damages should have been awarded for breach of\n\ncontract and infliction of emotional distress.\n\n             The court denied those damages, finding no evidence to\n\nsupport them. Although broadly arguing principles in which emotional\n\ndamages could apply to either claim, short of conclusory factual\n\ninferences not warranted by the record, the Sorensons fail to show\n\nspecific facts that demonstrate the error of the district court’s\n\njudgment.\n\n             For example, although the district court found no evidence\n\neither plaintiff suffered the “severe distress” essential to their\n\nclaims, they have shown us no reason why that finding is faulty.\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fIndeed, the court observed the very essence of their claim was\n\nundercut by virtue of Mr. Sorenson’s “continu[ing] to work as a\n\ncommercial airline pilot throughout the relevant period, and without\n\nany reports (by him or by the physicians who examined him every six\n\nmonths) of distress.”   We are not persuaded the district court erred\n\nby granting Block summary judgment on this claim.\n\nIV.   Denial of Motion for Reconsideration.\n\n           The Sorensons contend the district court should have\n\ngranted their motion for reconsideration for several reasons.    Once\n\nagain, our standard of review of this issue is limited.     “[O]nce a\n\nmotion . . . for summary judgment has been granted, the district\n\ncourt has substantial discretion in deciding whether to reopen the\n\nproceedings in order to allow the unsuccessful party to introduce new\n\nmaterial or argue a new theory.”     Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, 118 F.3d\n\n10, 13 (1st Cir. 1997)(quoting Mackin v. City of Boston, 969 F.2d\n\n1273, 1279 (1st Cir. 1992)).    “Consequently, we will overturn the\n\ntrial court’s decision on such a matter only if an appellant can\n\npersuade us that the refusal to grant favorable consideration was a\n\nclear abuse of discretion.”    Id.   The Sorensons fail to make that\n\nshowing.\n\n           The Sorensons argue the district court erred in not\n\nreconsidering their claim that Block‘s conduct constituted unfair and\n\ndeceptive business practices as that term is defined in Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch 93A, § 2.    They assert a breach of contract coupled with\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fconduct that is “immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous”\n\nmeets that definition.     The district court held “[t]here is nothing\n\nimmoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous in making a disclosure\n\nof suspected fraud to the IRS, even if it was a breach of Block’s\n\ncontractual obligation of confidentiality.”          Because we are in full\n\nagreement with that holding, we cannot say the district court’s\n\nruling on this issue was a clear abuse of discretion.\n\nV.   Other Issues.\n\n             The Sorensons contend the conduct of H & R Block and\n\nBrandenburg was “outrageous in character and extreme in degree” and\n\n“beyond   all   possible   bounds   of   decency.”      They   add,   “Block,\n\nBrandenburg, and other employees, went to great lengths to cause\n\nSorensons severe emotional distress, all in their effort to punish\n\nSorenson and to protect Brandenburg and Block from tax preparer\n\npenalties.”     Specific factual evidence justifying this hyperbole is\n\nnot cited.    In a similar vein, the Sorensons assert Mr. Sorenson had\n\nto undergo a DOR audit, IRS civil and criminal audits, and “such\n\nbetrayal exceeds all possible bounds of decency and is absolutely\n\natrocious.”     We find no facts in the record that justify these\n\ncharacterizations either.       Moreover, the arguments conveniently\n\noverlook the fact that the tax deductions that were at the bottom of\n\nthe Sorensons’ difficulty were taken only because of Mr. Sorenson’s\n\ninsistence and contrary to the advice given to him by Block.           We are\n\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fnot inclined to reverse the district court on the basis of these arguments.\n\n             After entry of the order granting summary judgment on the\n\nmajor issues, the district court directed the parties to work towards\n\nframing those remaining for final judgment so the court and parties\n\ncould avoid “further investment of extensive resources at the trial\n\ncourt level.”       In response, Block moved for summary judgment in the\n\nmaximum   amount        of    damages     previously   found    by   the   court.   In\n\ncontrast, the Sorensons moved for reconsideration as previously\n\nnoted.    Not only did the court find no new issues in the motion, but\n\nalso it denied the Sorensons’ attempt to present new evidence.                      The\n\ncourt    held    the    “expert     opinion”       plaintiffs    offered   to   support\n\nreconsideration comprised evidence that would be inadmissible and\n\nwould not affect the results already reached by the court.\n\n             Now the Sorensons claim this procedure caused them “unfair\n\nprejudice” because it came about before they could exercise their\n\n“absolute       right    to    a   jury    trial.”     This     argument   is   without\n\nsubstance.       As we have already noted, the denial of reconsideration\n\nwas proper. Moreover, the parties’ “right to trial” had already been\n\nprecluded by the grant of summary judgment.\n\n             The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -15-\n\f",

Walter F. and Sarah O.\n\nSorenson, appeal the dismissal of their action for damages against\n\nH & R Block, Inc. and others (collectively “Block”).   Our review of\n\nthe issues raised by the Sorensons on appeal discloses no error,\n\nand we affirm.\n\n          Mr. Sorenson, an airline pilot who also owns a small\n\nbusiness, used Block to prepare his state and federal income tax\n\nreturns for years.    Apparently no problems emerged from this\n\nassociation until preparation of the returns for tax year 1993.\n\nThen, however, disputes arose because Mr. Sorenson insisted on\n\nclaiming certain income tax deductions contrary to Block’s advice.\n\nMr. Sorenson ultimately prevailed and the deductions were made; but\n\nlater he was subjected to audits by the Massachusetts Department of\n\nRevenue (DOR) and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).      Although\n\nmatters with the taxing authorities were settled, Mr. Sorenson paid\n\nthe DOR over $8,000 and the IRS over $45,000 in back taxes,\n\ninterest, and penalties for the tax years 1993, 1994, and 1995.\n\n          The Sorensons brought this action against Block seeking\n\n$5 million in damages, asserting claims for negligence; breach of\n\nfiduciary duty; professional malpractice; intentional or negligent\n\ninfliction of emotional distress; breach of contract; breach of the\n\ncovenant of good faith and fair dealing; intentional or negligent\n\nmisrepresentation; loss of consortium; and false and deceptive\n\n\n\n\n                               -3-\n\ftrade practices under Massachusetts statutes.1               Plaintiffs and\n\ndefendants both moved for summary judgment.            After a studious and\n\ncareful consideration of all the issues, the district court granted\n\nsummary judgment to Block, except for a specific breach of contract\n\nclaim and a trade practices claim.2          On those, the court granted\n\njudgment to the Sorensons and awarded total damages of $630.\n\n             The genesis of the dispute between the parties occurred\n\non March 3, 1994 during an interview for the purpose of preparing\n\nMr. Sorenson’s      1993   returns.     At   that    meeting,    Mr.   Sorenson\n\ninsisted that he was entitled to claim a deduction from taxable\n\nincome for expenses he incurred in campaigning for local political\n\noffice. He also insisted upon a charitable deduction for left over\n\nfood he had given to a charity when his wedding was cancelled.3\n\n             The   preparer   and   supervisory      personnel   advised    Mr.\n\nSorenson those deductions were improper.            Unwilling to accept that\n\nadvice, Mr. Sorenson called Block’s headquarters to protest. Among\n\nhis complaints was his dissatisfaction with the service he had\n\nreceived from Karl Brandenburg, the district manager under whose\n\ndirection the Sorenson return was being prepared.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      Although not an original party to the action, having filed a\nbrief in this court on the discovery issues raised in the district\ncourt, the IRS was added as a party to this appeal.\n     2\n         Sorenson v. H & R Block,Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2002</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">31194868</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (D. Mass.)\n     3\n         Apparently he had no receipts for those donations.\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            During that conversation, Mr. Sorenson told Linda Murphy,\n\nMr. Brandenburg’s supervisor, that he was going to a local Block\n\noffice “in an hour” to sign the necessary form to have his return\n\nfiled electronically.        He demanded a resolution from Ms. Murphy of\n\nwhether his campaign expenses were deductible before he signed the\n\ndocument.    Without having received a response to that demand, Mr.\n\nSorenson nonetheless signed the form permitting electronic filing\n\nof his return on March 16, 1994.        The return claimed the deductions\n\nquestioned by Block.\n\n            In July of 1994, the DOR commenced an audit of Mr.\n\nSorenson’s state returns, ultimately determining he had improperly\n\ndeclared a Massachusetts domicile.          Consequently, DOR disallowed\n\ndeductions based on that claim as well as other employee business\n\nexpenses    and   assessed    Mr.   Sorenson   $8,322.93   in   back    taxes,\n\ninterest, and penalties.\n\n            In June 1995, the IRS notified Mr. Sorenson of an audit\n\nof his 1993 federal return.         Mr. Sorenson was instructed to attend\n\na meeting with an auditor and to provide supporting information for\n\ndeductions he had taken including charitable contributions and\n\nemployee expenses.     Mr. Brandenburg accompanied Mr. Sorenson to at\n\nleast two meetings with IRS Agent Paul Lounsbury, the auditor.\n\n            Before the first meeting, Mr. Brandenburg told Agent\n\nLounsbury he knew the reason for the audit and stated he “wished”\n\nhe had the “courage” to report Mr. Sorenson to the IRS.                He also\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fshowed Agent Lounsbury a number of Block’s internal memoranda\n\nconcerning Mr. Sorensons’s 1993 return, including a memo Mr.\n\nBrandenburg had written to Ms. Murphy describing the return as\n\n“Fraud in Capital Letters.”\n\n            At a subsequent meeting, in Mr. Sorenson’s presence,\n\nAgent Lounsbury asked for a paper copy of the 1993 return.                     In\n\nresponse, Mr. Brandenburg handed over a file which contained not\n\nonly the return but also copies of Block’s internal memos and a\n\nletter to Mr. Sorenson that Mr. Brandenburg had prepared but had\n\nnot sent.      The parties agree that at that time, Mr. Sorenson did\n\nnot know those documents were in the file or even existed.                 Whether\n\nMr. Brandenburg knew the Block papers were in the file when he gave\n\nit to Agent Lounsbury is unresolved.\n\n            In late 1996, Mr. Sorenson hired an attorney to represent\n\nhim in the audit process which, by that time, had grown to include\n\ntax years 1992 through 1995.          About a year later, the attorney was\n\ninformed    the   case   had   been    turned   over    to    the   IRS   Criminal\n\nInvestigation Division.        The underlying circumstances behind the\n\ninvestigation were the deductions Mr. Sorenson had claimed on his\n\nreturns and other subsequent actions for which he was responsible.\n\n            Mr. Sorenson had applied for a bank loan in connection\n\nwith his business.         In support of that loan application, he\n\nobtained “amended returns” for 1994 and 1995 which indicated an\n\nincome   for    that   business   substantially        more   than   the    income\n\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\fdisclosed    in    the   returns   he   actually    filed   for   those   years.\n\nAlthough the “amended returns” were used in connection with the\n\nloan application, they were never filed with the IRS.\n\n             After six months, IRS closed the criminal investigation\n\nand returned the Sorenson file for a continuation of the civil\n\naudit.   By then, however, the statute of limitations for recovery\n\nof back taxes for 1992 through 1994 had expired, leaving for\n\npossible recovery by the IRS only the penalties for civil fraud for\n\nthose years.\n\n             Mr. Sorenson ultimately settled with the IRS. In exchange\n\nfor an agreement by the Service not to pursue civil fraud penalties\n\nfor any year, Mr. Sorenson waived the statute of limitations on\n\nordinary assessments for 1994.           He also agreed to pay $46,439 in\n\nback taxes (deemed negligently unpaid) for 1994 and 1995, plus\n\ninterest and non-fraud penalties.\n\n             On the basis of these essential facts, the Sorensons\n\ncontend the district court erred on many issues.

Fiduciary Responsibility of a Tax Preparer.\n\n            The Sorensons first assert that as a tax preparer, Block\n\nhad a fiduciary responsibility to them which Block breached in\n\nseveral ways.    Although the Sorensons’ counsel admits he has found\n\n“no case in Massachusetts which holds that tax preparers owe a\n\nfiduciary duty to their clients,”4 he nonetheless argues such a\n\nfiduciary duty arises when trust is reposed in one who has “a great\n\ndisparity of knowledge or expertise in a commercial setting.”             He\n\nbuttresses that theory by relying principally upon Green v. H & R\n\nBlock, Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1889510\"><a href=\"/opinion/1889510/green-v-h-r-block-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">735</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1039</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Md. 1999) and Basile v.

As the district court correctly recognized, however, the\n\nrationale is inapposite because it is dependent upon a theory of\n\nagency    recognized   in   Maryland     and   Pennsylvania   but   not   in\n\nMassachusetts.\n\n            As the district court noted, Massachusetts courts have\n\naccepted the Restatement’s view that the essential ingredients of an\n\nagency relationship are: 1) the agent’s power to alter the legal\n\nrelationships between the principal and third parties; 2) a fiduciary\n\nrelationship toward the principal regarding matters within the scope\n\n      4\n      The district court was less equivocal.    It said there is\nnone, and it was not going to break new ground.\n\n                                   -8-\n\fof the agency; and 3) the principal’s right to control the agent’s\n\nconduct in matters within the scope of the agency.

Mead\n\nJohnson & Co., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1446408\"><a href=\"/opinion/1446408/sabel-v-mead-johnson-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">135</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 138 (D. Mass. 1990) (citing the\n\nRestatement (Second) of Agency §§ 12 -14 (1958)); United States v.\n\nFerber, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">266</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">90</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 100 (D. Mass. 1997).\n\n             The district court concluded two of the three requirements\n\nof an agency relationship between Mr. Sorenson and Block were\n\nunproved. Block did not have the power to alter Mr. Sorensons’ legal\n\nrelationships with others, nor did Mr. Sorenson have the capacity to\n\ncontrol Block’s conduct in the preparation of tax returns.             These\n\nconclusions have patent support in the record.\n\n             Having failed to prove the essential elements of an agency\n\nrelationship, the Sorensons’ basic premise fails, and with it, the\n\ncontention     that   Block   breached    fiduciary   duties.   With    that\n\nconclusion, we do not consider allied arguments they assert.\n\nII.   Compelling Disclosure of IRS Source.\n\n             The Sorensons next argue the district court erred by\n\ndenying their motion to compel the IRS to disclose the name of the\n\nperson who provided the Service with information about Mr. Sorenson’s\n\ntax returns.    They contend the denial of this information “unfairly\n\nprejudiced” them, postulating the disclosure would have permitted\n\nthem to show the court Block “received a benefit from turning in\n\nSorenson.”     With this evidence, they could have proved “additional\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fdamages flowing from this wrongdoing.”              Moreover, the information\n\ncould have “bolster[ed] their claims for breach of contract and\n\nunfair and deceptive business practices at trial.”\n\n             This discovery dispute is governed by a stringent standard\n\nof review.    We will intervene in discovery matters only upon a clear\n\nshowing of manifest injustice, that is, where the lower court’s\n\ndiscovery    order   was   plainly   wrong    and   resulted   in   substantial\n\nprejudice to the aggrieved party.

Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. Inc., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"520577\"><a href=\"/opinion/520577/thomasina-mack-v-the-great-atlantic-and-pacific-tea-company-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">871</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">179</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 186 (1st Cir. 1989).        The Sorensons have failed to clear\n\nthis high hurdle.\n\n             The   District   Director   instructed     IRS    employees   being\n\ndeposed in this case that they could testify about any conversations\n\nwith Block employees pertinent to Mr. Sorenson’s taxes, but they were\n\nnot to disclose any information or records that would reveal a\n\nconfidential source.       Faced with the issue of whether the identity\n\nof the informant was discoverable, the magistrate judge, in an order\n\nlater adopted by the district judge, ruled it was not.                The court\n\nreasoned the issue was governed by the Administrative Procedure Act,\n\n5 U.S.C. § 702, because the government is not a party to this action.\n\n             The APA proscribes overruling any agency action that is\n\nnot “arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or otherwise not\n\nin accordance with law.”          5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A).             Viewing the\n\nstatutory prohibition of disclosing “return information” under 26\n\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fU.S.C. § 6103, and the broad inclusory language of that statute, see\n\nChamberlain v. Kurtz, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"362343\"><a href=\"/opinion/362343/bart-b-chamberlain-jr-etc-plaintiff-appellee-cross-v-jerome-kurtz/\"><span class=\"volume\">589</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">827</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 837 (5th Cir. 1979), the court\n\nconcluded the refusal to reveal the identity of the informant did not\n\nrise to the level required for an order compelling disclosure.               That\n\nholding is not plainly wrong.\n\nIII.     Damages.\n\n               The district court concluded Block had a contractual\n\nobligation to keep confidential the contents of Mr. Sorenson’s\n\nreturns, and this obligation was breached for tax year 1993.                    As\n\ndamages, the court awarded the cost of the preparation of those\n\nreturns.       The Sorensons now argue they are entitled to foreseeable\n\nand consequential damages for the penalties and interest Mr. Sorenson\n\nhad to pay, contending under the common law they must be placed in\n\nthe same position they would have occupied had the contract not been\n\nbreached.\n\n               The district court held there is “no basis under any\n\ntheory    of    recovery   to   shift   responsibility     for   the   amount   of\n\nSorenson’s unpaid back taxes.           These are Sorenson’s responsibility,\n\nhowever they came to be discovered.              And, absent some contractual\n\nobligation, I decline to permit recovery of interest and penalties\n\nas well.”      (emphasis in original).         We see no error in this holding.\n\nMoreover, Sorensons’ proof was inadequate to show              causation between\n\nBlock’s         actions         and     those        claimed      damages.\n\n               The Sorensons also argue the district court erred by\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fgranting summary judgment to Block on the Sorensons’ claim of damages\n\nfor unauthorized disclosure of information prior to the filing of the\n\n1993   return.    They   argue   the    evidence   “strongly   supports   the\n\ninference that a Block employee turned in Sorenson.”             They do not\n\nstate what other damages resulted from this alleged breach but\n\ncontend only they should have been able to go to trial on the\n\ninference.    The district court held there was no evidence to support\n\nthe claim of breach and refused to award preparation fees for 1991,\n\n1992, 1994, and 1995.        Again, this holding is supported by the\n\nrecord.\n\n             The Sorensons also maintain the district court erred by\n\ndenying   them   emotional   distress    damages,   contending    there    are\n\nunresolved material issues of fact applicable to that claim.              They\n\nargue additional damages should have been awarded for breach of\n\ncontract and infliction of emotional distress.\n\n             The court denied those damages, finding no evidence to\n\nsupport them. Although broadly arguing principles in which emotional\n\ndamages could apply to either claim, short of conclusory factual\n\ninferences not warranted by the record, the Sorensons fail to show\n\nspecific facts that demonstrate the error of the district court’s\n\njudgment.\n\n             For example, although the district court found no evidence\n\neither plaintiff suffered the “severe distress” essential to their\n\nclaims, they have shown us no reason why that finding is faulty.\n\n\n\n                                   -12-\n\fIndeed, the court observed the very essence of their claim was\n\nundercut by virtue of Mr. Sorenson’s “continu[ing] to work as a\n\ncommercial airline pilot throughout the relevant period, and without\n\nany reports (by him or by the physicians who examined him every six\n\nmonths) of distress.”   We are not persuaded the district court erred\n\nby granting Block summary judgment on this claim.\n\nIV.   Denial of Motion for Reconsideration.\n\n           The Sorensons contend the district court should have\n\ngranted their motion for reconsideration for several reasons.    Once\n\nagain, our standard of review of this issue is limited.     “[O]nce a\n\nmotion . . . for summary judgment has been granted, the district\n\ncourt has substantial discretion in deciding whether to reopen the\n\nproceedings in order to allow the unsuccessful party to introduce new\n\nmaterial or argue a new theory.”     Aybar v. Crispin-Reyes, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197430\"><a href=\"/opinion/197430/aybar-v-crispin-reyes/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">10</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 13 (1st Cir. 1997)(quoting Mackin v. City of Boston, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"587240\"><a href=\"/opinion/587240/lawrence-mackin-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">969</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>\n\n<span class=\"page\">1273</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1279 (1st Cir. 1992)).    “Consequently, we will overturn the\n\ntrial court’s decision on such a matter only if an appellant can\n\npersuade us that the refusal to grant favorable consideration was a\n\nclear abuse of discretion.”    Id.   The Sorensons fail to make that\n\nshowing.\n\n           The Sorensons argue the district court erred in not\n\nreconsidering their claim that Block‘s conduct constituted unfair and\n\ndeceptive business practices as that term is defined in Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch 93A, § 2.    They assert a breach of contract coupled with\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fconduct that is “immoral, unethical, oppressive, or unscrupulous”\n\nmeets that definition.     The district court held “[t]here is nothing\n\nimmoral, unethical, oppressive or unscrupulous in making a disclosure\n\nof suspected fraud to the IRS, even if it was a breach of Block’s\n\ncontractual obligation of confidentiality.”          Because we are in full\n\nagreement with that holding, we cannot say the district court’s\n\nruling on this issue was a clear abuse of discretion.\n\nV.   Other Issues.\n\n             The Sorensons contend the conduct of H & R Block and\n\nBrandenburg was “outrageous in character and extreme in degree” and\n\n“beyond   all   possible   bounds   of   decency.”      They   add,   “Block,\n\nBrandenburg, and other employees, went to great lengths to cause\n\nSorensons severe emotional distress, all in their effort to punish\n\nSorenson and to protect Brandenburg and Block from tax preparer\n\npenalties.”     Specific factual evidence justifying this hyperbole is\n\nnot cited.    In a similar vein, the Sorensons assert Mr. Sorenson had\n\nto undergo a DOR audit, IRS civil and criminal audits, and “such\n\nbetrayal exceeds all possible bounds of decency and is absolutely\n\natrocious.”     We find no facts in the record that justify these\n\ncharacterizations either.       Moreover, the arguments conveniently\n\noverlook the fact that the tax deductions that were at the bottom of\n\nthe Sorensons’ difficulty were taken only because of Mr. Sorenson’s\n\ninsistence and contrary to the advice given to him by Block.           We are\n\n\n\n\n                                    -14-\n\fnot inclined to reverse the district court on the basis of these arguments.\n\n             After entry of the order granting summary judgment on the\n\nmajor issues, the district court directed the parties to work towards\n\nframing those remaining for final judgment so the court and parties\n\ncould avoid “further investment of extensive resources at the trial\n\ncourt level.”       In response, Block moved for summary judgment in the\n\nmaximum   amount        of    damages     previously   found    by   the   court.   In\n\ncontrast, the Sorensons moved for reconsideration as previously\n\nnoted.    Not only did the court find no new issues in the motion, but\n\nalso it denied the Sorensons’ attempt to present new evidence.                      The\n\ncourt    held    the    “expert     opinion”       plaintiffs    offered   to   support\n\nreconsideration comprised evidence that would be inadmissible and\n\nwould not affect the results already reached by the court.\n\n             Now the Sorensons claim this procedure caused them “unfair\n\nprejudice” because it came about before they could exercise their\n\n“absolute       right    to    a   jury    trial.”     This     argument   is   without\n\nsubstance.       As we have already noted, the denial of reconsideration\n\nwas proper. Moreover, the parties’ “right to trial” had already been\n\nprecluded by the grant of summary judgment.\n\n             The judgment of the district court is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                            -15-\n\f</pre>",
