Langer with whom Marshall J. Tinkle and Tompkins,\nClough, Hirshon & Langer, P.A. were on brief for defendant.\n     David J. Perkins with whom Perkins Olson, P.A. was on brief\nfor plaintiffs.\n\n\n\n                           December 19, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            BOUDIN, Chief Judge.     During a construction project, a\n\nbarge owned by one project subcontractor, Weeks Marine, Inc.\n\n(\"Weeks\"),   collided   with   underwater   railways   located    on    the\n\nproperty of another project subcontractor, Reed & Reed, Inc.\n\n(\"Reed\"). The ultimate question on this appeal is whether a damage\n\nclaim against Weeks by Reed and its insurer is barred by a so-\n\ncalled waiver-of-subrogation provision embedded in the complex\n\ncontractual scheme governing the project.\n\n            In 1998, Bath Iron Works (\"BIW\") and Clark Builders of\n\nMaine (\"Clark\") entered into a construction contract (\"BIW-Clark\n\ncontract\") to build a land-level transfer facility for BIW on the\n\nKennebec River.    Clark subcontracted with Atkinson Construction\n\n(\"Atkinson\"),   which   in   turn   subcontracted   work   separately    to\n\nCallahan Brothers (\"Callahan\") and Weeks.      Callahan--a union-labor\n\naffiliate of Reed--entered into a subcontract with Reed, engaging\n\nReed to construct marine railway tracks (\"ways\") in a riverside\n\nyard owned by Reed across the river from the main BIW facility.\n\n            Callahan intended to use the Reed ways to move a number\n\nof large concrete blocks (called \"landing grids\"), weighing about\n\n400 tons each, into the Kennebec River for transport by Weeks to\n\nthe main construction site for use as dry-dock supports.         Callahan\n\nalso separately leased from Reed the yard in which the ways were to\n\nbe built.    Thus, Callahan could manufacture the grids at Reed's\n\nyard and transport them to the river via the constructed ways.\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fWeeks would then pick up the grids from the river end of the ways\n\nand transport them across the river by barge.\n\n            After the ways were completed in the summer of 2000, the\n\nbarge   transports    commenced.        During       one    of    the    transports,\n\noccurring    on   October    11,    2000,    the    Weeks       barge   damaged    the\n\nsubmerged    ways;   the    ways,   although       part    of    the    leased   yard,\n\nremained Reed's property and were available for future use by Reed\n\nin its own right.          The damage was repaired, and the transfers\n\ncontinued.    In due course, the damage caused by Weeks to Reed's\n\nways was reimbursed by Reed's property insurer, St. Paul Fire and\n\nMarine (\"St. Paul\").\n\n            Reed and St. Paul then brought suit in district court\n\nagainst Weeks, and after a bench trial, the court found Weeks\n\nliable for negligence, awarding Reed and St. Paul $298,100 in\n\ndamages--the amount the court found necessary to restore the ways\n\nto their pre-collision condition.              Weeks now appeals from the\n\njudgment; Reed cross-appeals (an unnecessary step) to support the\n\njudgment on alternative grounds not adopted by the district court.\n\n            In the district court, much of the controversy centered\n\naround a waiver-of-subrogation clause invoked by Weeks as barring\n\nrecovery by Reed (and therefore by St. Paul as the subrogee\n\nstanding in Reed's shoes).          The clause was contained in Exhibit E\n\nto the Atkinson-Callahan contract and provided as follows:\n\n            10. Waiver of Subrogation - To the extent that\n            a loss is covered by insurance in force, and\n\n                                       -3-\n\f            recovery is made for such loss, the BIW and\n            Contractor and Subcontractor's [sic] hereby\n            mutually release each other from liability and\n            waive all rights of subrogation and all rights\n            of recovery against each other for any loss\n            insured   against   under   their   respective\n            policies (including extended coverage), no\n            matter how caused, it being understood that\n            the damaged party will look solely to its\n            insurer for reimbursement. BIW shall require\n            all Subcontractors to similarly waive their\n            rights of subrogation in each of their\n            respective construction contracts with respect\n            to the work.\n\n            Exhibit    E,     obscurely     drafted    in    the   tradition    of\n\ninsurance    policies       and   related    documents,      described   a    BIW-\n\ncontrolled insurance regime for subcontractors on the project but\n\nalso contemplated that some subcontractors might not be covered by\n\nthis regime and imposed separate requirements upon them.                     It is\n\nunclear whether the waiver provision, placed between provisions\n\ndirected at the two different groups, applied to both groups or\n\nonly the former.\n\n            Even greater confusion attended the question whether\n\nExhibit E, whatever its meaning as to covered parties, applied to\n\nReed at all.      It was not attached to the Callahan-Reed contract,\n\nnor   was   it   specifically     mentioned    in     that   contract.       Weeks,\n\nhowever, asserted that Exhibit E bound Reed because of language in\n\nthe Callahan-Reed contract that stated, inter alia, that\n\n            the    GENERAL   CONTRACT    documents   are\n            incorporated in this agreement by this\n            reference, with the same force and effect as\n            if same were set forth at length herein; and\n            that the SUBCONTRACTOR will be bound by any\n\n                                       -4-\n\f             and all contract documents insofar as they\n             relate in any part or in any way, directly or\n             indirectly, to the work covered by this\n             agreement.1\n\nWhether     Exhibit   E   constituted   one   of   the   \"general   contract\n\ndocuments\" was disputed.\n\n             Following a bench trial, the district court made a number\n\nof findings that strongly suggested that the waiver provision would\n\napply to Reed for any damage that occurred to Reed's property in\n\nthe course of its work under the Callahan-Reed contract.            However,\n\nthe district court also concluded that the damage had occurred\n\nafter Reed had completed its basic work (construction of the ways),\n\nand that the waiver provision had no effect on Reed's rights as a\n\nproperty owner to collect from Weeks for damage later caused by\n\nWeeks to Reed's property.\n\n             On appeal, Weeks urges that the district court read the\n\nwaiver provision too narrowly.      Reed not only defends the district\n\ncourt's rationale for deciding in Reed's favor, but also argues\n\nthat it (Reed) was never bound by Exhibit E at all, or, if it was,\n\nthat the waiver provision did not apply because Reed was not part\n\n\n     1\n         A companion provision in the Callahan-Reed contract stated:\n\n     Except as modified by this Subcontract, Subcontractor\n     agrees to adhere to and be bound to the Contractor by all\n     of the provisions of the General Contract and to the\n     contract   documents   affecting   subcontractor's   work\n     hereunder, and, insofar as its work is concerned, to\n     assume towards the Contractor all of the duties,\n     obligations and liabilities that the Contractor assumes\n     toward the Owner.\n\n                                    -5-\n\fof the BIW-controlled insurance program (and--Reed asserts--the\n\nwaiver applied only to such participants).                Weeks contests these\n\npropositions and, among other assertions, argues that Callahan and\n\nReed are alter egos.\n\n             It is uncertain whether this tangled dispute, with its\n\nidiosyncratic documentation, has a \"right\" answer in any meaningful\n\nsense, and given the litigation expenses, it is a mystery why it\n\nwas   not   settled.         Still,   it    must   now   be    decided.      As    to\n\nconstruction of contract language, our review is plenary, Principal\n\nMut. Life Ins. Co. v. Racal-Datacom, Inc., 233 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.\n\n2000),    but   as    to    application,    some   deference     is   due    to   the\n\nfactfinder, Bolton v. Taylor, 367 F.3d 5, 7-8 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n             In our view, the principle embodied in the district\n\ncourt's     reading    of    the   waiver   provision     is   correct      and   its\n\napplication to these facts, although a close call, should be\n\nsustained.      For the purposes of analysis, we assume arguendo that\n\nExhibit E was incorporated into the Callahan-Reed contract so far\n\nas it might be applicable to the present dispute.2\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      The district court found that the \"general contract\" referred\nto in the Callahan-Reed contract is the Atkinson-Callahan contract\n(rather than the BIW-Clark contract), and that Exhibit E was\nincorporated as a whole into this contract. The district court did\nnot address the separate Reed claim that even if Exhibit E does\napply, it applies only to subcontractors enrolled in the BIW-\nsponsored insurance program--an issue not easily resolved on this\nrecord.\n\n                                       -6-\n\f           Even if Exhibit E applied to Reed, however, it waived\n\nReed's rights against Weeks only insofar as they were within the\n\nscope of the provision.         In delineating the scope of the waiver\n\nprovision, the district court held that the waiver would apply only\n\nto claims related to Reed's work under the Callahan-Reed contract.\n\nIt stressed that the contract by its explicit terms incorporated\n\nprovisions associated with the general contract only so far as they\n\n\"relate[d]\" to or \"affect[ed]\" Reed's \"work\" for Callahan.\n\n           Weeks' broadest argument to the contrary is that the\n\nwaiver provision blocks any claims by Reed against Weeks (at least\n\nso far as they are covered by insurance); but this ignores the\n\n\"related\"/\"affected\" language.         Weeks claims, in its reply brief,\n\nthat the \"related to\" language does not modify or delimit the\n\nincorporation of the \"general contract\" to which Exhibit E is an\n\nannex;   but   a   careful   reading     of   the     Callahan-Reed      contract\n\nindicates otherwise.\n\n           Weeks'     argument     turns      upon     the     fact     that    the\n\nincorporation      provisions   quoted     above     (see    note   1   above   and\n\naccompanying text) use the related/affected phrases to qualify\n\n\"contract documents,\" and Weeks says that this does not include the\n\n\"general contract\" itself.        Yet this distinction is debatable as\n\ngrammar and artificial in substance.                 Furthermore, the phrase\n\n\"insofar as its [Reed's] work is concerned\" in the closing sentence\n\nof the second incorporation provision (note 1, above) is clearly\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\faddressed to the \"duties, obligations and liabilities\" imposed\n\npursuant to the general contract.\n\n           Weeks' argument also proves too much.      Suppose that two\n\nyears after Reed had finished all association with the BIW project,\n\na Weeks barge in the middle of the river slipped loose and\n\neventually drifted into Reed's ways, damaging them again. It could\n\nhardly be thought that such an incident was covered by a waiver\n\nclause framed to govern work that Reed had long completed.        Thus,\n\nat most, the waiver provision applies to claims by Reed related to\n\nor arising out of the work that Reed contracted to perform under\n\nthe Callahan-Reed contract.\n\n           Even so narrowed, it is a close question whether the\n\nincident is sufficiently tied to Reed's contracted-for work to come\n\nwithin the waiver provision.   The district court found as follows:\n\n                By October 11, 2000, Reed & Reed had\n           completed the ways and therefore completed the\n           work covered by its subcontract with Callahan.\n           Reed & Reed's claim in this lawsuit stems not\n           from any injury it suffered as a subcontractor\n           building the ways, but from an injury it\n           suffered as property owner.\n\nAfter Reed completed its work, the district court stated, it was\n\nmerely a property owner renting its yard and ways to Callahan and\n\n\"Reed did not waive its right as a property owner to recover for\n\ndamage negligently inflicted upon its property\" by Weeks.\n\n           In Weeks' favor is Maine case law supporting a generous\n\nreading   of   waiver-of-subrogation   clauses   in   the   interest   of\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\favoiding litigation--a central aim of such clauses.      See, e.g.,\n\nReliance Nat'l Indem. v. Knowles Indus. Servs., Corp., 868 A.2d\n\n220, 225-27 (Me. 2005); Willis Realty Assocs. v. Cimino Constr.\n\nCo., 623 A.2d 1287, 1288 (Me. 1993).    This is reinforced by some\n\nlanguage in the incorporation clauses that extends all contract\n\nprovisions to Reed \"insofar as they relate in any part or in any\n\nway, directly or indirectly, to the work covered by\" the Callahan-\n\nReed contract.\n\n           Yet what that \"work\" encompassed remains in dispute.\n\nAccording to Reed, its work was to construct the ways.    According\n\nto Weeks, even though Reed had completed its basic task of building\n\nthe ways well before the October 11 accident, it had ongoing\n\nancillary duties (e.g., to repair defects in its work found within\n\none year), and--Weeks argues--Reed's own conduct after it had\n\ncompleted construction shows that its \"work\" had not been completed\n\nat the time of the accident.\n\n           The contract language itself is not especially helpful to\n\nWeeks.   Nearly all of the items listed in the scope of work clause\n\nclearly deal with the construction and general setup of the ways;\n\nnone directly references any sort of post-construction duties. The\n\nduty-to-repair-defects provision does extend beyond the completion\n\nof the ways, but it is a limited, contingent obligation, and the\n\ndistrict court's findings as to the cause of the accident attribute\n\n\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fit to Weeks' negligent operations, not to any defect in the\n\noriginal construction.\n\n           This brings us to Weeks' claim that Reed's actual conduct\n\nshowed that its work extended beyond the completion of the ways.\n\n\"The   parties     to   an    agreement   know   best    what   they   meant,\"\n\nRestatement (Second) of Contracts § 202 cmt. g (1981), and thus the\n\nparties' subsequent course of performance may be instructive in\n\ncontract interpretation.         Id. § 202(4).   But much of Reed's post-\n\nconstruction conduct, such as sending construction details to\n\nAtkinson and permitting Atkinson to shorten one of the ways (both\n\ncompleted prior to the October 11 incident), could as easily be\n\ntaken to demarcate the completion of Reed's own work.\n\n           Weeks argues that Reed was involved in more substantial\n\npost-construction activities, such as monitoring the loading of the\n\ngrids and assisting Weeks in the loading process.               The record is\n\nfar from clear as to whether Reed in fact took part in such\n\nactivities.      Given the deference due to the factfinder, we accept\n\nthe district court's characterization.\n\n           In sum, by the time of the accident, Reed had completed\n\nthe ways and merely permitted the use of its ways for the launching\n\nof the concrete blocks.        This latter engagement was not done in the\n\nperformance   of    the      Callahan-Reed   contract;    there   is   nothing\n\nwhatsoever in that contract about such an obligation.             Reed's ways\n\nwere made available to Callahan for launching the grids or for any\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fother purpose by virtue of Callahan's separate lease of the yard\n\nfrom    Reed--a   lease   that   (as   the    district    court   pointed    out)\n\ncontains no waiver-of-subrogation clause.\n\n            The outcome admittedly turns on formalities: the formal\n\ncorporate separation of two close affiliates--Callahan and Reed--\n\nand the formal separation of Reed's construction work for Callahan\n\nfrom its lease of its property to Callahan.              These separations, in\n\nturn, derived in part from the irrelevant fact that Reed was a non-\n\nunion contractor; otherwise, Reed might have contracted directly\n\nwith Atkinson to build the ways and launch the grids.\n\n            Weeks contests the respect given to the formal separation\n\nbetween Callahan and Reed, arguing that two passages in its post-\n\ntrial brief to the district court raised a veil-piercing claim.\n\nThese    passages--which    contain     only   passing     references   to    the\n\npossibility that Reed and Callahan may not be independent entities-\n\n-do not represent a developed argument. The veil-piercing argument\n\nis thus unavailable on appeal.          Daigle v. Me. Med. Ctr., Inc., 14\n\nF.3d 684, 687 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            Finally, focusing upon the Callahan-Reed lease, Weeks\n\nargues that the lease required Callahan, not Weeks, to indemnify\n\nReed for any damage to the yard (including the ways), and did not\n\ngive Reed a right of action against anyone other than Callahan.               On\n\nthe contrary, Reed was not obliged to collect from Callahan, and\n\nthe lease did not surrender potential Reed claims against third\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fparties.   As the owner, Reed was free (so far as the lease was\n\nconcerned) to sue anyone who negligently damaged its yard or ways.\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -12-\n\f",

However, the district court also concluded that the damage had occurred <i>after</i> Reed had completed its basic work (construction of the ways), and that the waiver provision had no effect on Reed's rights as a property owner to collect from Weeks for damage later caused by Weeks to Reed's property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal, Weeks urges that the district court read the waiver provision too narrowly. Reed not only defends the district court's rationale for deciding in Reed's favor, but also argues that it (Reed) was never bound by Exhibit E at all, or, if it was, that the waiver provision did not apply because Reed was not part of the BIW-controlled insurance program (and&#8212;Reed asserts&#8212;the waiver applied only to such participants).

Still, it must now be decided. As to construction of contract language, our review is plenary, <i>Principal Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Racal-Datacom, Inc.,</i> 233 F.3d 1, 3 (1st Cir.2000), but as to application, some deference is due to the factfinder, <i>Bolton v.

For the purposes of analysis, we assume <i>arguendo</i> that Exhibit E was incorporated into the Callahan-Reed contract so far as it might be applicable to the present dispute.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if Exhibit E applied to Reed, however, it waived Reed's rights against Weeks <i>only insofar as they were within the scope of the provision.</i> In delineating the scope of the waiver provision, the district court held that the waiver would apply only to claims related to Reed's work under the Callahan-Reed contract. It stressed that the contract by its explicit terms incorporated provisions associated with the general contract only so far as they \"relate[d]\" to or \"affect[ed]\" Reed's \"work\" for Callahan.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weeks' broadest argument to the contrary is that the waiver provision blocks any claims by Reed against Weeks (at least so far as they are covered by insurance); but this ignores the \"related\"/\"affected\" language. Weeks claims, in its reply brief, that the \"related to\" language does not modify or delimit the incorporation of the \"general contract\" to which Exhibit E is an annex; but a careful reading of the Callahan-Reed contract indicates otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weeks' argument turns upon the fact that the incorporation provisions quoted above (<i>see</i> note 1 above and accompanying text) use the related/affected phrases to qualify \"contract documents,\" and Weeks says that this does not include the \"general contract\" itself. Yet this distinction is debatable as grammar and artificial in substance. Furthermore, the phrase \"insofar as its [Reed's] work is concerned\" in the closing sentence of the second incorporation provision (note 1, above) is clearly addressed to the \"duties, obligations and liabilities\" imposed pursuant to the general contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weeks' argument also proves too much. Suppose that two years after Reed had finished all association with the BIW project, a Weeks barge in the middle of the river slipped loose and eventually drifted into Reed's ways, damaging them again. It could hardly be thought that such an incident was covered by a waiver clause framed to govern work that Reed had long completed. Thus, at most, the waiver provision applies to claims by Reed related to or arising out of the work that Reed contracted to perform under the Callahan-Reed contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so narrowed, it is a close question whether the incident is sufficiently tied to Reed's contracted-for work to come within the waiver provision. The district court found as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By October 11, 2000, Reed &amp; Reed had completed the ways and therefore completed the work covered by its subcontract with Callahan. Reed &amp; Reed's claim in this lawsuit stems not from any injury it suffered as a subcontractor building the ways, but from an injury it suffered as property owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Reed completed its work, the district court stated, it was merely a property owner renting its yard and ways to Callahan and \"Reed did not waive its right as a property owner to recover for damage negligently inflicted upon its property\" by Weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Weeks' favor is Maine case law supporting a generous reading of waiver-of-subrogation clauses in the interest of avoiding litigation&#8212;a central aim of such clauses. <i>See, e.g., Reliance Nat'l Indem. v. Knowles Indus. Servs., Corp.,</i> 868 A.2d 220, 225-27 (Me.2005); <i>Willis Realty Assocs. v. Cimino Constr. Co.,</i> 623 A.2d 1287, 1288 (Me.1993). This is reinforced by some language in the incorporation clauses that extends all contract provisions to Reed \"insofar as they relate in any part or in any way, directly or indirectly, to the work covered by\" the Callahan-Reed contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet what that \"work\" encompassed remains in dispute. According to Reed, its work was to construct the ways. According to Weeks, even though Reed had completed its basic task of building the ways well before the October 11 accident, it had ongoing ancillary duties (<i>e.g.,</i> to repair defects in its work found within one year), and&#8212;Weeks argues&#8212;Reed's own conduct after it had completed construction shows that its \"work\" had not been completed at the time of the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contract language itself is not especially helpful to Weeks. Nearly all of the items listed in the scope of work clause clearly deal with the construction and general setup of the ways; none directly references any sort of post-construction duties. The duty-to-repair-defects provision does extend beyond the completion of the ways, but it is a limited, contingent obligation, and the district court's findings as to the cause of the accident attribute it to Weeks' negligent operations, not to any defect in the original construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Weeks' claim that Reed's actual conduct showed that its work extended beyond the completion of the ways. \"The parties to an agreement know best what they meant,\" <i>Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i> &#167; 202 cmt. g (1981), and thus the parties' subsequent course of performance may be instructive in contract interpretation. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 202(4). But much of Reed's post-construction conduct, such as sending construction details to Atkinson and permitting Atkinson to shorten one of the ways (both completed prior to the October 11 incident), could as easily be taken to demarcate the completion of Reed's own work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weeks argues that Reed was involved in more substantial post-construction activities, such as monitoring the loading of the grids and assisting Weeks in the loading process. The record is far from clear as to whether Reed in fact took part in such activities. Given the deference due to the factfinder, we accept the district court's characterization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, by the time of the accident, Reed had completed the ways and merely permitted the use of its ways for the launching of the concrete blocks. This latter engagement was <i>not</i> done in the performance of the Callahan-Reed contract; there is nothing whatsoever in that contract about such an obligation. Reed's ways were made available to Callahan for launching the grids or for any other purpose by virtue of Callahan's separate lease of the yard from Reed&#8212;a lease that (as the district court pointed out) contains no waiver-of-subrogation clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The outcome admittedly turns on formalities: the formal corporate separation of two close affiliates&#8212;Callahan and Reed&#8212;and the formal separation of Reed's construction work <i>for</i> Callahan from its lease of its property <i>to</i> Callahan. These separations, in turn, derived in part from the irrelevant fact that Reed was a non-union contractor; otherwise, Reed might have contracted directly with Atkinson to build the ways and launch the grids.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weeks contests the respect given to the formal separation between Callahan and Reed, arguing that two passages in its post-trial brief to the district court raised a veil-piercing claim. These passages&#8212;which contain only passing references to the possibility that Reed and Callahan may not be independent entities&#8212;do not represent a developed argument. The veil-piercing argument is thus unavailable on appeal. <i>Daigle v. Me. Med. Ctr., Inc.,</i> 14 F.3d 684, 687 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, focusing upon the Callahan-Reed lease, Weeks argues that the lease required Callahan, not Weeks, to indemnify Reed for any damage to the yard (including the ways), and did not give Reed a right of action against anyone other than Callahan. On the contrary, Reed was not obliged to collect from Callahan, and the lease did not surrender potential Reed claims against third parties. As the owner, Reed was free (so far as the lease was concerned) to sue anyone who negligently damaged its yard or ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A companion provision in the Callahan-Reed contract stated:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Except as modified by this Subcontract, Subcontractor agrees to adhere to and be bound to the Contractor by all of the provisions of the General Contract and to the contract documents affecting subcontractor's work hereunder, and, insofar as its work is concerned, to assume towards the Contractor all of the duties, obligations and liabilities that the Contractor assumes toward the Owner.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court found that the \"general contract\" referred to in the Callahan-Reed contract is the Atkinson-Callahan contract (rather than the BIW-Clark contract), and that Exhibit E was incorporated as a whole into this contract.

(\"Weeks\"), collided with underwater railways located on the property of another project subcontractor, Reed &amp; Reed, Inc. (\"Reed\"). The ultimate question on this appeal is whether a damage claim against Weeks by Reed and its insurer is barred by a so-called waiver-of-subrogation provision embedded in the complex contractual scheme governing the project.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1998, Bath Iron Works (\"BIW\") and Clark Builders of Maine (\"Clark\") entered into a construction contract (\"BIW-Clark contract\") to build a land-level transfer facility for BIW on the Kennebec River. Clark subcontracted with Atkinson Construction (\"Atkinson\"), which in turn subcontracted work separately to Callahan Brothers (\"Callahan\") and Weeks. Callahan&#8212;a union-labor affiliate of Reed&#8212;entered into a subcontract with Reed, engaging Reed to construct marine railway tracks (\"ways\") in a riverside yard owned by Reed across the river from the main BIW facility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Callahan intended to use the Reed ways to move a number of large concrete blocks (called \"landing grids\"), weighing about 400 tons each, into the Kennebec River for transport by Weeks to the main construction site for use as dry-dock supports. Callahan also separately leased from Reed the yard in which the ways were to be built. Thus, Callahan could manufacture the grids at Reed's yard and transport them to the river via the constructed ways. Weeks would then pick up the grids from the river end of the ways and transport them across the river by barge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the ways were completed in the summer of 2000, the barge transports commenced.

Weeks claims, in its reply brief, that the \"related to\" language does not modify or delimit the incorporation of the \"general contract\" to which Exhibit E is an annex; but a careful reading of the Callahan-Reed contract indicates otherwise.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weeks' argument turns upon the fact that the incorporation provisions quoted above (<i>see</i> note 1 above and accompanying text) use the related/affected phrases to qualify \"contract documents,\" and Weeks says that this does not include the \"general contract\" itself. Yet this distinction is debatable as grammar and artificial in substance. Furthermore, the phrase \"insofar as its [Reed's] work is concerned\" in the closing sentence of the second incorporation provision (note 1, above) is clearly addressed to the \"duties, obligations and liabilities\" imposed pursuant to the general contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weeks' argument also proves too much. Suppose that two years after Reed had finished all association with the BIW project, a Weeks barge in the middle of the river slipped loose and eventually drifted into Reed's ways, damaging them again. It could hardly be thought that such an incident was covered by a waiver clause framed to govern work that Reed had long completed. Thus, at most, the waiver provision applies to claims by Reed related to or arising out of the work that Reed contracted to perform under the Callahan-Reed contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so narrowed, it is a close question whether the incident is sufficiently tied to Reed's contracted-for work to come within the waiver provision. The district court found as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By October 11, 2000, Reed &amp; Reed had completed the ways and therefore completed the work covered by its subcontract with Callahan. Reed &amp; Reed's claim in this lawsuit stems not from any injury it suffered as a subcontractor building the ways, but from an injury it suffered as property owner.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Reed completed its work, the district court stated, it was merely a property owner renting its yard and ways to Callahan and \"Reed did not waive its right as a property owner to recover for damage negligently inflicted upon its property\" by Weeks.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Weeks' favor is Maine case law supporting a generous reading of waiver-of-subrogation clauses in the interest of avoiding litigation&#8212;a central aim of such clauses. <i>See, e.g., Reliance Nat'l Indem. v. Knowles Indus. Servs., Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">868</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 225-27 (Me.2005); <i>Willis Realty Assocs. v. Cimino Constr. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">623</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1287</span></span>, 1288 (Me.1993). This is reinforced by some language in the incorporation clauses that extends all contract provisions to Reed \"insofar as they relate in any part or in any way, directly or indirectly, to the work covered by\" the Callahan-Reed contract.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Yet what that \"work\" encompassed remains in dispute. According to Reed, its work was to construct the ways. According to Weeks, even though Reed had completed its basic task of building the ways well before the October 11 accident, it had ongoing ancillary duties (<i>e.g.,</i> to repair defects in its work found within one year), and&#8212;Weeks argues&#8212;Reed's own conduct after it had completed construction shows that its \"work\" had not been completed at the time of the accident.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contract language itself is not especially helpful to Weeks. Nearly all of the items listed in the scope of work clause clearly deal with the construction and general setup of the ways; none directly references any sort of post-construction duties. The duty-to-repair-defects provision does extend beyond the completion of the ways, but it is a limited, contingent obligation, and the district court's findings as to the cause of the accident attribute it to Weeks' negligent operations, not to any defect in the original construction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This brings us to Weeks' claim that Reed's actual conduct showed that its work extended beyond the completion of the ways. \"The parties to an agreement know best what they meant,\" <i>Restatement (Second) of Contracts</i> &#167; 202 cmt. g (1981), and thus the parties' subsequent course of performance may be instructive in contract interpretation. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 202(4). But much of Reed's post-construction conduct, such as sending construction details to Atkinson and permitting Atkinson to shorten one of the ways (both completed prior to the October 11 incident), could as easily be taken to demarcate the completion of Reed's own work.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weeks argues that Reed was involved in more substantial post-construction activities, such as monitoring the loading of the grids and assisting Weeks in the loading process. The record is far from clear as to whether Reed in fact took part in such activities. Given the deference due to the factfinder, we accept the district court's characterization.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, by the time of the accident, Reed had completed the ways and merely permitted the use of its ways for the launching of the concrete blocks. This latter engagement was <i>not</i> done in the performance of the Callahan-Reed contract; there is nothing whatsoever in that contract about such an obligation. Reed's ways were made available to Callahan for launching the grids or for any other purpose by virtue of Callahan's separate lease of the yard from Reed&#8212;a lease that (as the district court pointed out) contains no waiver-of-subrogation clause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The outcome admittedly turns on formalities: the formal corporate separation of two close affiliates&#8212;Callahan and Reed&#8212;and the formal separation of Reed's construction work <i>for</i> Callahan from its lease of its property <i>to</i> Callahan. These separations, in turn, derived in part from the irrelevant fact that Reed was a non-union contractor; otherwise, Reed might have contracted directly with Atkinson to build the ways and launch the grids.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Weeks contests the respect given to the formal separation between Callahan and Reed, arguing that two passages in its post-trial brief to the district court raised a veil-piercing claim. These passages&#8212;which contain only passing references to the possibility that Reed and Callahan may not be independent entities&#8212;do not represent a developed argument. The veil-piercing argument is thus unavailable on appeal. <i>Daigle v. Me. Med. Ctr., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195171\"><a href=\"/opinion/195171/daigle-v-maine-medical/\"><span class=\"volume\">14</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">684</span></a></span>, 687 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, focusing upon the Callahan-Reed lease, Weeks argues that the lease required Callahan, not Weeks, to indemnify Reed for any damage to the yard (including the ways), and did not give Reed a right of action against anyone other than Callahan. On the contrary, Reed was not obliged to collect from Callahan, and the lease did not surrender potential Reed claims against third parties. As the owner, Reed was free (so far as the lease was concerned) to sue anyone who negligently damaged its yard or ways.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> A companion provision in the Callahan-Reed contract stated:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Except as modified by this Subcontract, Subcontractor agrees to adhere to and be bound to the Contractor by all of the provisions of the General Contract and to the contract documents affecting subcontractor's work hereunder, and, insofar as its work is concerned, to assume towards the Contractor all of the duties, obligations and liabilities that the Contractor assumes toward the Owner.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The district court found that the \"general contract\" referred to in the Callahan-Reed contract is the Atkinson-Callahan contract (rather than the BIW-Clark contract), and that Exhibit E was incorporated as a whole into this contract.
