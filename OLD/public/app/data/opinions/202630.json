This diversity action was\n\nbrought in the United States District Court for the District of\n\nMaine   in   February   2006     by   Frank   Wetmore    (“Wetmore”)    against\n\nMacdonald, Page, Schatz, Fletcher & Co., LLC (“Macdonald Page”), a\n\nMaine limited liability company none of whose members shares\n\nWetmore’s Massachusetts citizenship.           Wetmore’s complaint alleges\n\nthat Macdonald Page committed professional negligence, breach of\n\ncontract     and   negligent    misrepresentation       when   it   appraised   a\n\nbusiness in which Wetmore was a shareholder for less than half its\n\nactual value.\n\n             When Macdonald Page moved to dismiss the action under\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. (“Rule”) 12(b)(6), a magistrate judge recommended\n\ngranting its motion, and the district court then upheld that\n\nrecommendation.      Wetmore has filed a timely appeal challenging the\n\ndismissal.\n\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\n\n             As taught in such cases as Epstein v. C.R. Bard, Inc.,\n\n460 F.3d 183, 187 (1st Cir. 2006):\n\n             We review a Rule 12(b)(6) dismissal de novo,\n             considering all well-pleaded facts in the\n             complaint to be true.\n\nThat familiar principle adheres to the seminal teaching of Conley\n\nv. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-56 (1957) that “a complaint should not\n\nbe dismissed for failure to state a claim unless it appears beyond\n\ndoubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fhis claim which would entitle him to relief.”                 To that end, in\n\naddition to the acceptance of all well-pleaded allegations and all\n\nreasonable inferences from those allegations as well, Nisselson v.\n\nLernout, 469 F.3d 143, 150 (1st Cir. 2006) explains:\n\n            Facts distilled in that fashion may be\n            augmented by reference to (i) documents\n            annexed to it [the complaint] or fairly\n            incorporated into it, and (ii) matters\n            susceptible to judicial notice.\n\n                                    BACKGROUND\n\n            Wetmore’s complaint concerns the sale of his stock in\n\nPortland Shellfish Company, Inc. (“Company”), a Maine-based close\n\ncorporation whose chief business is processing live shellfish.                  As\n\none of the two owners, Wetmore held 300 voting and 150 non-voting\n\nshares of Company stock, while the remaining 300 voting shares were\n\nheld by Donna Holden.     Ms. Holden’s husband Jeff (hereafter simply\n\n“Holden”) served as President of the Company and managed its daily\n\noperations, including production, procurement and sales.\n\n            Under the Company’s Shareholders’ and Officers’ Agreement\n\n(“Agreement,”   attached       to   the    complaint   as    an    exhibit),   the\n\nCompany’s   board   of   directors        was   restricted    to    two   members:\n\nWetmore and Holden.       By late 2001 number of disagreements had\n\narisen between Wetmore and the Holdens over the management and\n\ndirection of the Company.           After unsuccessful efforts to resolve\n\nthose   differences,     the   Holdens       invoked   the   deadlock-breaking\n\nprovision of Agreement §11.5.5:\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f     In the event the operations of the Company are impaired\n     because of deadlock on the board of directors, the\n     shareholders agree that they shall each have the right to\n     acquire the other shareholder’s stock, as follows. In\n     the event of a deadlock, the directors shall hire an\n     accountant at MacDonald Page & Co., South Portland,\n     Maine, to determine the value of the outstanding shares.\n     Once the value is reported to the directors by the\n     accountant, the directors shall call a meeting, each\n     shareholder shall have the right to buy out the other\n     shareholder(s)’ interest, at a price equal to or greater\n     than the price determined by the accountant. The highest\n     offer made by any shareholder at the meeting shall be\n     binding upon the other shareholder(s). The shareholder\n     who is acquiring the stock shall be required to close on\n     the acquisition within 90 days of the meeting of the\n     shareholders.\n\n          In   accordance    with   that   provision,   Wetmore      and   the\n\nHoldens retained Macdonald Page to evaluate the Company’s shares by\n\nidentifying the fair market value of a 100% common equity interest.\n\nIn its engagement letter Macdonald Page defined “fair market\n\nvalue”:\n\n     The price at which the property would change hands\n     between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither\n     being under a compulsion to buy or sell and both having\n     reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.\n\n          As called for by the Agreement and Macdonald Page’s\n\nengagement   letter,   it   delivered     its   valuation   report   to    the\n\nCompany, estimating “the fair market value of the common stock of\n\n[the Company] at June 30, 2002, to be approximately $1,090,000.”\n\nMs. Holden then offered to purchase Wetmore’s shares at a price\n\nequal to 60% (Wetmore’s proportionate share) of Macdonald Page’s\n\nvaluation.   Wetmore, however, resisted that offer and countered by\n\noffering $1.25 million for Ms. Holden’s shares if Holden would sign\n\n                                    -4-\n\fa non-compete agreement.         Alternatively Wetmore offered to join in\n\nselling the Company to a third party.\n\n            In   response   the    Holdens    rejected     both   of     Wetmore’s\n\noffers. Ms. Holden insisted that Wetmore was obligated to sell his\n\nshares pursuant to Agreement §11.5.5, stating that she would sue if\n\nhe refused.      Facing the threat of litigation, Wetmore sold his\n\nshares to Ms. Holden for $750,705, a price that represented 60% of\n\nthe Macdonald Page evaluation after adjustment to eliminate a 7%\n\n“marketability discount” included in Macdonald Page’s report.\n\n            As stated at the outset, Wetmore’s Complaint asserts that\n\nMacdonald Page’s valuation “was well less than half the actual\n\nvalue” of the Company’s total stock, which Wetmore attributes to\n\nfactors including Macdonald Page’s disregard for “commonly accepted\n\nand   reliable    methods   of    valuation   in   favor    of    less   reliable\n\nmethods.”        More   specifically,    Count     I   charges     professional\n\nnegligence, Count II charges breach of contract and Count III\n\ncharges negligent misrepresentation.\n\n                        REQUIRED ELEMENTS OF PROOF\n\n            All three of Wetmore’s claims stem from the common\n\nlaw--two sound in tort, one in contract.           And all three were found\n\nwanting by the district court based on its determination that\n\nWetmore would be unable to prove causation, a critical element in\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\feach.1\n\n            Thus Graves v. S.E. Downey Land Surveyor, P.A., 885 A.2d\n\n779, 782 (Me. 2005)(emphasis added) instructs that “[t]he plaintiff\n\nin a professional negligence action must establish the appropriate\n\nstandard of care, demonstrate that the defendant deviated from that\n\nstandard, and prove that the deviation caused the plaintiff’s\n\ndamages.”    Similarly, Maine Energy Recovery Co. v. United Steel\n\nStructures, Inc., 724 A.2d 1248, 1250 (Me. 1999)(emphasis added)\n\nidentifies the required elements of proof in a breach of contract\n\naction as comprising “(1) breach of a material contract term;\n\n(2) causation; and (3) damages.”   Finally, Chapman v. Rideout, 568\n\nA.2d 829, 830 (Me. 1990) holds that Maine recognizes the tort of\n\nnegligent misrepresentation as defined in Restatement (Second) of\n\nTorts, §552(1) (1977)(emphasis added)):\n\n     One who, in the course of his business, profession or\n     employment, or in any other transaction in which he has\n     a pecuniary interest, supplies false information for the\n     guidance of others in their business transactions, is\n     subject to liability for pecuniary loss caused to them by\n     their justifiable reliance upon the information, if he\n     fails to exercise reasonable care or competence in\n     obtaining or communicating the information.\n\n            With all other components of each of Wetmore’s theories\n\nof recovery plainly being met by his complaint’s allegations, the\n\ncentral issue on this appeal is whether Wetmore’s well-pleaded\n\n\n\n     1\n        Throughout this opinion we look to the substantive law of\nMaine, which Agreement §15 designates as providing the rules of\ndecision.\n\n                                 -6-\n\ffacts support a claim that Macdonald Page’s negligent valuation\n\ncaused him to receive less than fair market value for his shares.\n\nWe turn to that question.\n\n                                CAUSATION ELEMENT\n\n               As we have said in Napier v. F/V Deesie, Inc., 454 F.3d\n\n61, 68 (1st Cir. 2006), “[i]n order for the negligent act to\n\nconstitute         proximate   cause,   the   act    or   omission   must   be    a\n\nsubstantial factor in bringing about the harm and the injury\n\nincurred must have been a reasonably foreseeable consequence.”2\n\nMerriam v. Wanger, 757 A.2d 778, 780-81 (Me. 2000) has put the same\n\nconcept in these terms:\n\n       Evidence is sufficient to support a finding of proximate\n       cause if the evidence and inferences that may reasonably\n       be drawn from the evidence indicate that the negligence\n       played a substantial part in bringing about or actually\n       causing the injury or damage and that the injury or\n       damage was either a direct result or a reasonably\n       foreseeable consequence of the negligence.      The mere\n       possibility of such causation is not enough, and when the\n       matter remains one of pure speculation or conjecture, or\n       even if the probabilities are evenly balanced, a\n       defendant is entitled to judgment.\n\n               Notably, Merriam does not insist that a defendant’s\n\nconduct must be the only cause of the harm--instead it must have\n\ncontributed substantially to the harm suffered.               We therefore look\n\nto the question whether under the facts as pleaded a reasonable\n\njury       could   conclude    that   Macdonald     Page’s   negligence     was   a\n\n\n\n       2\n        Although Napier was a case sounding in admiralty, its\nstated principles of proximate causation are universally applied.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fsubstantial factor in Wetmore’s recieving less than the full market\n\nvalue of his shares.\n\n           According to the district court, Wetmore cannot establish\n\ncausation because “[n]othing in the Agreement or in the other\n\nfactual allegations of the complaint required the plaintiff to\n\naccept Donna Holden’s offer.”         Instead “[a]ll he had to do was\n\noffer her the same amount or more per share for her shares than she\n\nhad offered him for his.”         It was the district court’s view that\n\nthe deadlock provision required Wetmore to accept Ms. Holden’s\n\noffer only if and when he determined that he was unwilling to offer\n\nmore money per share to purchase her stock.          Through the district\n\ncourt’s lens Wetmore “had many options, ranging from challenging\n\nthe appraisal in any of a number of ways to offering Donna Holden\n\nthe same amount per share to offering her more per share.”\n\n           In that light the district court ultimately held that\n\nMacdonald Page’s valuation was not and could not have been a cause,\n\nsubstantial or otherwise, of Wetmore’s loss.          We disagree.\n\n           Under the Agreement the parties, in the event of a\n\ndeadlock, were required to hire Macdonald Page in what would be the\n\nfirst   step   in   potentially    resolving   the   stalemate.      It   was\n\nMacdonald Page’s role to provide a valuation that the parties would\n\nuse to begin a bidding process.            As the plain language of the\n\nAgreement put it, the purpose of the Macdonald Page valuation was\n\n“to determine the value of the outstanding shares” so that at the\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fensuing shareholders’ meeting “each shareholder shall have the\n\nright to buy out the other shareholder(s)’ interest, at a price\n\nequal to or greater than the price determined by the accountant”\n\n(emphasis added).     In brief, Macdonald Page’s figure was to serve\n\nas a floor--the lowest possible bid.           To say that a negligently-\n\narrived-at valuation that set an artificially low floor would not\n\nhave a substantial effect on a shareholder in Wetmore’s position\n\nignores the logic of cause and effect.\n\n             Importantly, Wetmore was under no compulsion to enter the\n\nactive bidding process.       If for any reason he felt himself unable\n\nto compete on a level playing field after acquiring total ownership\n\nof the Company (it will be remembered that the Holdens would be\n\nfree to engage in the same business post-sale, with Holden having\n\nthe operating experience that Wetmore lacks), he had the absolute\n\nright to accept Ms. Holden’s offer so long as it equaled or\n\nexceeded Macdonald Page’s valuation figure.            And that meant he had\n\nthe right to rely on Macdonald Page to generate a valuation that\n\nset a fair price for the shares.\n\n             Instead, under the allegations of the complaint that must\n\nbe   accepted   as   gospel   for   present    purposes,    Macdonald     Page\n\nimproperly promulgated a figure that was less than half the true\n\nvalue   of   Wetmore’s   shares.     To   be   sure,    Wetmore   could   have\n\nresponded by offering Ms. Holden more for her shares, but being\n\nlimited to that route deprived him of the full benefit of his\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fbargain by foreclosing his opportunity to sell at a fair price.\n\nOnce Macdonald Page rendered its negligent undervaluation of the\n\nCompany, it was too late--indeed, impossible--for Wetmore to choose\n\nto exercise that equally absolute right.           Wetmore’s allegations\n\nthus offer far more than “pure speculation or conjecture” (Merriam,\n\n757 A.2d at 781) as to Macdonald Page’s improper valuation being a\n\nsubstantial factor in Wetmore’s asserted loss.\n\n           It should be added that Wetmore’s injury was entirely\n\nforeseeable.    What Macdonald Page’s alleged misfeasance imposed on\n\nWetmore was precisely the type of bind that shareholders in a close\n\ncorporation seek to avoid when they include buy-sell provisions in\n\ntheir agreements. Protections afforded by buy-sell provisions that\n\nset a bidding floor are fully meaningful only if the initial\n\nvaluation of the company is performed accurately.          Otherwise, as\n\nhere, the distortion of that base valuation skews the entire\n\nprocess.\n\n           In   this   instance   the    parties   selected   a   buy-sell\n\nprovision that would have been evenhanded if the valuation had been\n\nproperly arrived at.    By contrast, it is entirely foreseeable that\n\na shareholder who receives an improperly low bid based on a\n\nnegligently-reached valuation will suffer a loss based on the\n\nundervaluation of his or her shares.         And here Macdonald Page’s\n\nengagement letter expressly confirmed its own understanding that\n\nits valuation would play a key role in the bidding process:\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f      We understand that our valuation conclusion will be used\n      in conjunction with the Company’s “Shareholder’s and\n      Officer’s Agreement” dated February 1, 1994, paragraph\n      11.5.5....\n\nTo   argue   that     Wetmore’s     loss   was     not    foreseeable     would    be\n\ndisingenuous, given that plain language confirming Macdonald Page’s\n\nduty to the Company’s shareholders.\n\n             In its decision the district court also reasoned that if\n\nMacdonald Page’s valuation had been higher, there is no guaranty\n\nthat Ms. Holden would have made an offer.                We too lack an unclouded\n\ncrystal   ball   to    tell    us   what   would    have     transpired    had    the\n\nvaluation been performed without negligence.                  There are multiple\n\npossibilities, including the prospect that an unsuccessful bidding\n\nprocess might for example have led the parties to resolve their\n\ndifferences, breaking their deadlock, or might instead have led to\n\nthe invocation of Maine’s statutory provision for the resolution of\n\ncorporate deadlocks.          But such speculation plays no part in the\n\ndetermination at the pleading stage whether Wetmore has stated a\n\ncognizable claim--he clearly has. We emphasize that there are many\n\nfactual questions and matters of proof that remain unresolved, but\n\nthose will require a more developed record--they simply are not\n\nbefore us at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage.\n\n                                    CONCLUSION\n\n             For the reasons that have been stated here we REVERSE the\n\ndistrict court’s dismissal of Wetmore’s complaint and REMAND for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                       -11-\n\f",

(“Company”), a Maine-based close\n\ncorporation whose chief business is processing live shellfish.                  As\n\none of the two owners, Wetmore held 300 voting and 150 non-voting\n\nshares of Company stock, while the remaining 300 voting shares were\n\nheld by Donna Holden.     Ms. Holden’s husband Jeff (hereafter simply\n\n“Holden”) served as President of the Company and managed its daily\n\noperations, including production, procurement and sales.\n\n            Under the Company’s Shareholders’ and Officers’ Agreement\n\n(“Agreement,”   attached       to   the    complaint   as    an    exhibit),   the\n\nCompany’s   board   of   directors        was   restricted    to    two   members:\n\nWetmore and Holden.       By late 2001 number of disagreements had\n\narisen between Wetmore and the Holdens over the management and\n\ndirection of the Company.           After unsuccessful efforts to resolve\n\nthose   differences,     the   Holdens       invoked   the   deadlock-breaking\n\nprovision of Agreement §11.5.5:\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\f     In the event the operations of the Company are impaired\n     because of deadlock on the board of directors, the\n     shareholders agree that they shall each have the right to\n     acquire the other shareholder’s stock, as follows. In\n     the event of a deadlock, the directors shall hire an\n     accountant at MacDonald Page & Co., South Portland,\n     Maine, to determine the value of the outstanding shares.\n     Once the value is reported to the directors by the\n     accountant, the directors shall call a meeting, each\n     shareholder shall have the right to buy out the other\n     shareholder(s)’ interest, at a price equal to or greater\n     than the price determined by the accountant. The highest\n     offer made by any shareholder at the meeting shall be\n     binding upon the other shareholder(s). The shareholder\n     who is acquiring the stock shall be required to close on\n     the acquisition within 90 days of the meeting of the\n     shareholders.\n\n          In   accordance    with   that   provision,   Wetmore      and   the\n\nHoldens retained Macdonald Page to evaluate the Company’s shares by\n\nidentifying the fair market value of a 100% common equity interest.\n\nIn its engagement letter Macdonald Page defined “fair market\n\nvalue”:\n\n     The price at which the property would change hands\n     between a willing buyer and a willing seller, neither\n     being under a compulsion to buy or sell and both having\n     reasonable knowledge of relevant facts.\n\n          As called for by the Agreement and Macdonald Page’s\n\nengagement   letter,   it   delivered     its   valuation   report   to    the\n\nCompany, estimating “the fair market value of the common stock of\n\n[the Company] at June 30, 2002, to be approximately $1,090,000.”\n\nMs. Holden then offered to purchase Wetmore’s shares at a price\n\nequal to 60% (Wetmore’s proportionate share) of Macdonald Page’s\n\nvaluation.   Wetmore, however, resisted that offer and countered by\n\noffering $1.25 million for Ms. Holden’s shares if Holden would sign\n\n                                    -4-\n\fa non-compete agreement.         Alternatively Wetmore offered to join in\n\nselling the Company to a third party.\n\n            In   response   the    Holdens    rejected     both   of     Wetmore’s\n\noffers. Ms. Holden insisted that Wetmore was obligated to sell his\n\nshares pursuant to Agreement §11.5.5, stating that she would sue if\n\nhe refused.      Facing the threat of litigation, Wetmore sold his\n\nshares to Ms. Holden for $750,705, a price that represented 60% of\n\nthe Macdonald Page evaluation after adjustment to eliminate a 7%\n\n“marketability discount” included in Macdonald Page’s report.\n\n            As stated at the outset, Wetmore’s Complaint asserts that\n\nMacdonald Page’s valuation “was well less than half the actual\n\nvalue” of the Company’s total stock, which Wetmore attributes to\n\nfactors including Macdonald Page’s disregard for “commonly accepted\n\nand   reliable    methods   of    valuation   in   favor    of    less   reliable\n\nmethods.”        More   specifically,    Count     I   charges     professional\n\nnegligence, Count II charges breach of contract and Count III\n\ncharges negligent misrepresentation.\n\n                        REQUIRED ELEMENTS OF PROOF\n\n            All three of Wetmore’s claims stem from the common\n\nlaw--two sound in tort, one in contract.           And all three were found\n\nwanting by the district court based on its determination that\n\nWetmore would be unable to prove causation, a critical element in\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\feach.1\n\n            Thus Graves v.

Wanger, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">757</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">778</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 780-81 (Me. 2000) has put the same\n\nconcept in these terms:\n\n       Evidence is sufficient to support a finding of proximate\n       cause if the evidence and inferences that may reasonably\n       be drawn from the evidence indicate that the negligence\n       played a substantial part in bringing about or actually\n       causing the injury or damage and that the injury or\n       damage was either a direct result or a reasonably\n       foreseeable consequence of the negligence.      The mere\n       possibility of such causation is not enough, and when the\n       matter remains one of pure speculation or conjecture, or\n       even if the probabilities are evenly balanced, a\n       defendant is entitled to judgment.\n\n               Notably, Merriam does not insist that a defendant’s\n\nconduct must be the only cause of the harm--instead it must have\n\ncontributed substantially to the harm suffered.               We therefore look\n\nto the question whether under the facts as pleaded a reasonable\n\njury       could   conclude    that   Macdonald     Page’s   negligence     was   a\n\n\n\n       2\n        Although Napier was a case sounding in admiralty, its\nstated principles of proximate causation are universally applied.\n\n                                        -7-\n\fsubstantial factor in Wetmore’s recieving less than the full market\n\nvalue of his shares.\n\n           According to the district court, Wetmore cannot establish\n\ncausation because “[n]othing in the Agreement or in the other\n\nfactual allegations of the complaint required the plaintiff to\n\naccept Donna Holden’s offer.”         Instead “[a]ll he had to do was\n\noffer her the same amount or more per share for her shares than she\n\nhad offered him for his.”         It was the district court’s view that\n\nthe deadlock provision required Wetmore to accept Ms. Holden’s\n\noffer only if and when he determined that he was unwilling to offer\n\nmore money per share to purchase her stock.          Through the district\n\ncourt’s lens Wetmore “had many options, ranging from challenging\n\nthe appraisal in any of a number of ways to offering Donna Holden\n\nthe same amount per share to offering her more per share.”\n\n           In that light the district court ultimately held that\n\nMacdonald Page’s valuation was not and could not have been a cause,\n\nsubstantial or otherwise, of Wetmore’s loss.          We disagree.\n\n           Under the Agreement the parties, in the event of a\n\ndeadlock, were required to hire Macdonald Page in what would be the\n\nfirst   step   in   potentially    resolving   the   stalemate.      It   was\n\nMacdonald Page’s role to provide a valuation that the parties would\n\nuse to begin a bidding process.            As the plain language of the\n\nAgreement put it, the purpose of the Macdonald Page valuation was\n\n“to determine the value of the outstanding shares” so that at the\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fensuing shareholders’ meeting “each shareholder shall have the\n\nright to buy out the other shareholder(s)’ interest, at a price\n\nequal to or greater than the price determined by the accountant”\n\n(emphasis added).     In brief, Macdonald Page’s figure was to serve\n\nas a floor--the lowest possible bid.           To say that a negligently-\n\narrived-at valuation that set an artificially low floor would not\n\nhave a substantial effect on a shareholder in Wetmore’s position\n\nignores the logic of cause and effect.\n\n             Importantly, Wetmore was under no compulsion to enter the\n\nactive bidding process.       If for any reason he felt himself unable\n\nto compete on a level playing field after acquiring total ownership\n\nof the Company (it will be remembered that the Holdens would be\n\nfree to engage in the same business post-sale, with Holden having\n\nthe operating experience that Wetmore lacks), he had the absolute\n\nright to accept Ms. Holden’s offer so long as it equaled or\n\nexceeded Macdonald Page’s valuation figure.            And that meant he had\n\nthe right to rely on Macdonald Page to generate a valuation that\n\nset a fair price for the shares.\n\n             Instead, under the allegations of the complaint that must\n\nbe   accepted   as   gospel   for   present    purposes,    Macdonald     Page\n\nimproperly promulgated a figure that was less than half the true\n\nvalue   of   Wetmore’s   shares.     To   be   sure,    Wetmore   could   have\n\nresponded by offering Ms. Holden more for her shares, but being\n\nlimited to that route deprived him of the full benefit of his\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fbargain by foreclosing his opportunity to sell at a fair price.\n\nOnce Macdonald Page rendered its negligent undervaluation of the\n\nCompany, it was too late--indeed, impossible--for Wetmore to choose\n\nto exercise that equally absolute right.           Wetmore’s allegations\n\nthus offer far more than “pure speculation or conjecture” (Merriam,\n\n757 A.2d at 781) as to Macdonald Page’s improper valuation being a\n\nsubstantial factor in Wetmore’s asserted loss.\n\n           It should be added that Wetmore’s injury was entirely\n\nforeseeable.    What Macdonald Page’s alleged misfeasance imposed on\n\nWetmore was precisely the type of bind that shareholders in a close\n\ncorporation seek to avoid when they include buy-sell provisions in\n\ntheir agreements. Protections afforded by buy-sell provisions that\n\nset a bidding floor are fully meaningful only if the initial\n\nvaluation of the company is performed accurately.          Otherwise, as\n\nhere, the distortion of that base valuation skews the entire\n\nprocess.\n\n           In   this   instance   the    parties   selected   a   buy-sell\n\nprovision that would have been evenhanded if the valuation had been\n\nproperly arrived at.    By contrast, it is entirely foreseeable that\n\na shareholder who receives an improperly low bid based on a\n\nnegligently-reached valuation will suffer a loss based on the\n\nundervaluation of his or her shares.         And here Macdonald Page’s\n\nengagement letter expressly confirmed its own understanding that\n\nits valuation would play a key role in the bidding process:\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f      We understand that our valuation conclusion will be used\n      in conjunction with the Company’s “Shareholder’s and\n      Officer’s Agreement” dated February 1, 1994, paragraph\n      11.5.5....\n\nTo   argue   that     Wetmore’s     loss   was     not    foreseeable     would    be\n\ndisingenuous, given that plain language confirming Macdonald Page’s\n\nduty to the Company’s shareholders.\n\n             In its decision the district court also reasoned that if\n\nMacdonald Page’s valuation had been higher, there is no guaranty\n\nthat Ms. Holden would have made an offer.                We too lack an unclouded\n\ncrystal   ball   to    tell    us   what   would    have     transpired    had    the\n\nvaluation been performed without negligence.                  There are multiple\n\npossibilities, including the prospect that an unsuccessful bidding\n\nprocess might for example have led the parties to resolve their\n\ndifferences, breaking their deadlock, or might instead have led to\n\nthe invocation of Maine’s statutory provision for the resolution of\n\ncorporate deadlocks.          But such speculation plays no part in the\n\ndetermination at the pleading stage whether Wetmore has stated a\n\ncognizable claim--he clearly has. We emphasize that there are many\n\nfactual questions and matters of proof that remain unresolved, but\n\nthose will require a more developed record--they simply are not\n\nbefore us at the Rule 12(b)(6) stage.\n\n                                    CONCLUSION\n\n             For the reasons that have been stated here we REVERSE the\n\ndistrict court’s dismissal of Wetmore’s complaint and REMAND for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n                                       -11-\n\f</pre>",
