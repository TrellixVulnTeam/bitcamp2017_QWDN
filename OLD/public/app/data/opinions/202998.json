Nancy Gertner, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n\n                  Torruella and Dyk,* Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Jennifer Hay Zacks, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellant.\n     Robert L. Sheketoff for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           October 30, 2007\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Federal Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          BOUDIN, Chief Judge. This is an appeal by the government\n\ncontesting the sentence imposed by the district court on Gary Milo.\n\nMilo was arrested in 2003 for trafficking in marijuana.               He\n\nthereafter agreed to plead guilty and assist the government in\n\npending investigations.    The government in turn agreed, subject to\n\ngetting substantial cooperation, to file a motion for a reduced\n\nguideline sentence, U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1, and a sentence below the\n\nmandatory minimum, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) (2000).\n\n          On April 29, 2004, Milo pled guilty to a sealed one-count\n\ninformation   alleging    conspiracy   to   possess   with   intent   to\n\ndistribute and to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. §\n\n846 (2000).    The information described Milo's role in heading a\n\nlarge-scale marijuana distribution operation in Massachusetts,\n\nspanning four years and involving \"1,000 kilograms or more\" of\n\nmarijuana.    Forfeiture of Milo's proceeds from the operation was\n\nsought as well.   21 U.S.C. § 853.\n\n          As is common in such cases, sentencing was deferred while\n\nMilo assisted investigators.    In May 2006, the cooperation having\n\nbeen completed, the probation officer prepared the pre-sentence\n\nreport, and the government filed its promised motion.          The PSR\n\nfound Milo accountable for over 6,000 kilos of marijuana; it found\n\nthat the conspiracy had been an extensive one involving five or\n\nmore participants; and it found that Milo himself had directed at\n\nleast two individuals to transport marijuana or drug proceeds.        It\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\falso noted that while under supervision Milo had tested positive\n\nfor cocaine on one occasion.\n\n            Milo, born in 1955, was described in the PSR as having\n\nbeen brought up in an upper middle class home, although it said\n\nthat he had suffered some abuse.            He was married, had attended but\n\nnot graduated from college and had learned building design from his\n\nfather. He had a builder's license and a realtor's license and had\n\nworked in both fields and estimated his income (apart from drugs)\n\nat $50,000 a year.         His estimated net worth slightly exceeded $2.5\n\nmillion.\n\n            The PSR calculated the mandatory minimum sentence as 10\n\nyears, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(vii), and the guidelines range as\n\n151 to 188 months.         The calculation reflected a base offense level\n\nof 34 premised on the 6,000 kilos and no prior criminal history.\n\nAn upward three-level adjustment for role in the offense matched an\n\nequal reduction for acceptance of responsibility.                   U.S.S.G. §§\n\n3B1.1(b),     3E1.1.        Milo    objected    that   the   kilo   amount   was\n\noverstated; the probation officer said that it did not affect the\n\ncalculation.\n\n            In its promised motion, the government described Milo's\n\ncooperation     in     a   number    of   different    investigations.       The\n\ngovernment moved both for relief from the mandatory minimum, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(e), and from the otherwise applicable guideline\n\nsentence, U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1, and proposed to recommend a sentence of\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f75   months,    approximately      half   of   the   guideline   minimum    as\n\ncalculated by the probation officer.\n\n             Letters were submitted by those who knew Milo.                They\n\ndescribed him (with detailed examples) as a caring and decent\n\nperson, helpful to others; set forth his work since his arrest for\n\nHabitat for Humanity and other charitable endeavors; attested to\n\nhis contrition; expressed confidence that he would never repeat his\n\ncrime; and, in many cases, expressed hope that he would not have to\n\nserve time in prison.\n\n             At sentencing, Milo's experienced counsel said he had\n\nseen few examples of such complete remorse and urged that Milo be\n\ngiven no time in prison.       The prosecutor agreed that Milo had done\n\n\"a   great   job\"   and   helped   the    government   \"in   significant   and\n\nimportant ways.\"          But, she said, Milo had brought thousands of\n\npounds of marijuana into the district over a number of years, and\n\n75 months was a \"generous\" reduction from the ordinary guideline\n\nsentence.\n\n             After Milo spoke, expressing contrition and saying that\n\nhe had sought to turn his life around, the district court said that\n\nit would accept defense counsel's recommendation.                  The judge\n\nreferred without elaboration to Milo's \"extraordinary\" cooperation\n\nand the force of the letters in the record and said that the 18\n\ndays already spent by Milo in detention and the prospect of a very\n\nlarge forfeiture yet to be computed counted as punishment.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f             The court then sentenced Milo to time served, five years\n\nof supervised release with the first six months to be served in a\n\ncommunity corrections facility, and a fine of $50,000. Thereafter,\n\nin denying a government motion for reconsideration, the district\n\ncourt rejected any suggestion that the government should have been\n\nsurprised by the sentence and elaborated on what the court said was\n\nalready in the record before the sentencing hearing:\n\n             The sentencing concerned the extraordinary\n             nature of Mr. Milo's cooperation as described\n             in the government's presentation. But it also\n             concerned the extent to which Mr. Milo had\n             changed his life, the steps he had taken in\n             his work, steps which effectively increased\n             the amount of money the government was likely\n             to recover on forfeiture, and his exemplary\n             work with Habitat for Humanity.\n\n             In discussing the government's objections, the court said\n\nthat   the    Milo   sentencing   was   about   contrition   as   well   as\n\ncooperation; that many defendants bargain and cooperate as a kind\n\nof \"business arrangement\" but that Milo was genuinely remorseful\n\nand \"had changed his life (addressing his addictions, working for\n\nHabitat for Humanity, etc.).\"       The court referred briefly to the\n\nlarge forfeiture judgment expected. It agreed with defense counsel\n\nthat Milo was \"someone who the Court will never see again.\"\n\n             The government has now appealed to this court, arguing\n\nprimarily that the sentence is unreasonably low: specifically, that\n\n\"the district court sentenced a major marijuana dealer to time-\n\nserved . . . an 18-day term of imprisonment\" even though Milo\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fparticipated in an extensive four-year drug conspiracy yielding him\n\nalmost $10 million.        The government also attacks various of the\n\ndistrict court's statements in support of the sentence as without\n\nsupport or resting upon factors not properly considered.\n\n               We review sentences primarily for reasonableness, United\n\nStates v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 261 (2005), asking whether the\n\ndistrict court offered \"a plausible explanation\" and reached \"a\n\ndefensible overall result.\"       United States v. Jimenez-Beltre, 440\n\nF.3d 514, 519 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct.\n\n928     (2007).      Embedded   factual   findings   in   the   sentencing\n\ndetermination are reviewed for clear error, United States v. Misla-\n\nAldarondo, 478 F.3d 52, 70 (1st Cir.), cert. denied sub nom.,\n\nAldarondo v. United States, ___ S. Ct. ___, 2007 WL 1647161 (Oct.\n\n1, 2007), while claims of strictly legal error are reviewed de\n\nnovo.       United States v. Smith, 445 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2006).1\n\n               The government says that it is of no moment whether the\n\nproper guideline sentencing range was 87-108 (as the district court\n\nsaid) or 151-188 (as the PSR found).2         Either range calls for a\n\n\n        1\n      The Supreme Court's recent decision in Rita v. United States,\n127 S. Ct. 2456 (2007) (holding that a presumption of\nreasonableness may be accorded to a sentence within the guidelines\nrange) has no bearing on this case.       Two cases are currently\npending in the Supreme Court involving appellate review of district\ncourt departures from the Sentencing Guidelines. Gall v. United\nStates, No. 06-7949 (argued October 2, 2007); Kimbrough v. United\nStates, No. 06-6330 (argued October 2, 2007).\n       2\n        The PSR calculated a total offense level of 34 based in part\non    Milo's distribution of between 3,000 and 10,000 kilos of\n\n                                    -6-\n\fmulti-year sentence and, without a motion, the statutory mandatory\n\nminimum would be 10 years; the sentence imposed amounts to almost\n\nno time in prison.             The main question posed by the government's\n\nappeal    is    the    adequacy,        given   circumstances        and   the   court's\n\nexplanation, of such a sentence for a major drug crime that is\n\nordinarily heavily punished by a sentence of 10 to 15 years.\n\n               Three       subsidiary    government      arguments     warrant     brief\n\nattention.      The first is that the district court improperly relied\n\non the large forfeiture order (ultimately $9.9 million), which by\n\nstatute    must       be    imposed     \"in   addition    to   any    other      sentence\n\nimposed.\"      21 U.S.C. § 853(a) (emphasis added); see also 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3554.   But the statute does not say that the forfeiture can never\n\nbe considered by the district court in determining the overall\n\nsentence, and here the forfeiture was calculated on estimated\n\nproceeds (not profits) and so has punitive characteristics.\n\n               At the same time, one could hardly give the forfeiture in\n\nthis case much weight.            Given his net worth of $2.5 million, Milo\n\nmay never be able to pay the full forfeiture.                        And if Milo had\n\nindependent means, avoiding a prison sentence on this account would\n\ncreate an appearance that financially successful criminals can buy\n\n\nmarijuana. U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(3).    Apparently because Milo only\nadmitted in the plea agreement to \"over 1,000 kilograms\" of\nmarijuana, the court set the offense level at sentencing as 32,\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(4), yielding a range of 121-151 months. Then,\nthe court used level 29, equating to a range of 87-108.        The\nwritten judgment seemingly arrived at 29 by ignoring the three-\nlevel enhancement for role in the offense.\n\n                                              -7-\n\ftheir way out of prison.     See United States v. Mueffelman, 470 F.3d\n\n33, 40 (1st Cir. 2006); cf. United States v. Tom, ___ F.3d ___,\n\n2007 WL 2822908 at *5-6 (1st Cir. Oct. 1, 2007).                   The district\n\ncourt did not rely heavily on the forfeiture, mentioning it only\n\nbriefly, and we see no error in the district court's apparent\n\ndecision to afford some minor weight to it.\n\n            Second, the government argues that the district court\n\ngave undue emphasis to Milo's charitable activities.                These are a\n\ndiscouraged factor under the Sentencing Guidelines which provide:\n\n\"Military, civic, charitable, or public service; employment-related\n\ncontributions; and similar prior good works are not ordinarily\n\nrelevant    in   determining   whether      a   departure     is    warranted.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5H1.11.     The government does not claim this reliance to\n\nbe impermissible but merely to contribute to the unreasonableness\n\nof Milo's sentence.\n\n            Again, the district court did not place much weight on\n\nthese   activities    to   justify   by    themselves     a   lower   sentence.\n\nRather, the activities (which began after Milo's arrest and were\n\nreal but not extraordinary) appear mainly to have bolstered the\n\ncourt's    judgment   that   Milo    had   turned   his   life     around,   was\n\ngenuinely and not just conveniently contrite and would not re-\n\noffend.    This is perhaps an evidentiary use of post-arrest good\n\nworks to show rehabilitation and colorably a legitimate inference,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fif not overdone.3         We are not convinced that reliance on this\n\nfactor was overdone here.\n\n              Third, the government suggests that Milo's episode of\n\ncocaine use in 2005 undermines the district court's finding that he\n\nwas truly contrite and would not re-offend.                 We agree that the\n\ncocaine use weighs against the finding that Milo had cleaned up his\n\nact; but the court's finding seemingly rested on Milo's overall\n\nbehavior, his charitable works, the supporting letters, and the\n\nimpression made by Milo in his elocution.              The finding that Milo is\n\nunlikely to re-offend by drug dealing is not clearly erroneous.\n\nSee United States v. Robinson, 433 F.3d 31, 38 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n              So we are brought back to the central question of the\n\nreasonableness of the sentence, now narrowed to focus on the two\n\npoints      most   stressed     by   the    district   court:   contrition   and\n\ncooperation.       They present quite different problems.         The district\n\ncourt       laid   the   most    stress      on   contrition,   including    the\n\nunlikelihood of re-offense.4               We accept the finding that Milo's\n\n\n        3\n      Previous decisions have said that little weight should be\ngiven to the charitable contributions of business leaders who \"are\noften expected, by virtue of their positions, to engage in civic\nand charitable activities.\" United States v. Thurston, 358 F.3d\n51, 80 (1st Cir. 2004); see also United States v. Cooper, 394 F.3d\n172, 176-77 (3d Cir. 2005).\n        4\n      The government notes our opinion in United States v. Ahlers,\n305 F.3d 54, 60 (1st Cir. 2002), holding that a district court may\nconsider only a defendant's substantial assistance when imposing a\nsentence below the statutory minimum pursuant to the government's\nsection 3553(e) motion.    However, the government says it \"is not\npressing this issue on appeal,\" because Milo would be entitled to\n\n                                           -9-\n\fcontrition was real: the issue is how far this warrants a very\n\nlarge reduction in sentence.\n\n           Milo received a three-level adjustment for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility.   The government says that therefore the law has\n\nalready \"to some extent\" given him credit for contrition and that\n\nto wipe out the rest of his sentence on this ground underscores the\n\nunreasonableness of the sentence.   But in practice over 90 percent\n\nof drug traffickers who plead guilty get a two or three level\n\nadjustment, whether truly contrite and unlikely to re-offend or\n\nnot.   U.S. Sentencing Commission, 2005 Sourcebook of Federal\n\nSentencing Statistics, tbl. 19.\n\n           Real contrition, and a low chance of re-offense, can be\n\nsomething more.   From the standpoint of the public, re-offense is\n\na major concern when a defendant is sentenced for a serious crime;\n\nand contrition is sometimes a proxy for a reduced likelihood of re-\n\noffense.   The likelihood of re-offense depends on various factors\n\nin addition to contrition; but the factors are a set of variables\n\nregarding which, especially after Booker, the district court's\n\njudgment deserves weight.\n\n           Yet the weight given contrition cannot be beyond review\n\nfor reasonableness.   Full contrition and even a zero risk of re-\n\noffense engage major concerns of sentencing; incarceration is then\n\n\nrelief from the mandatory minimum under the section 3553(f) \"safety\nvalve,\" allowing the district court's consideration of Milo's\ncontrition in relation to the mandatory minimum.\n\n                               -10-\n\fperhaps not needed to reform that individual, to protect the\n\ncommunity from him and to deter him from committing new offenses.\n\nBut   punishment   is   also   meant   to   deter    others,   affirming   the\n\nseriousness of the crime and the penalties that others will likely\n\nface and the difficulty of avoiding punishment.\n\n           The need to deter others is under federal law a major\n\nelement in criminal sentencing, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B).5            Given\n\nthat objective, we do not see how, taken alone, or combined with\n\nthe other factors described above, contrition could justify a judge\n\nin imposing what is effectively no prison time on someone like Milo\n\nwho, without duress and simply for personal gain, operated a major\n\nmarijuana ring involving a number of individuals over an extensive\n\nperiod and resulting in the distribution of thousands of pounds of\n\nmarijuana.\n\n           Many    first   offenders    in    drug    distribution   cases--\n\nincluding young and impoverished women from other countries used to\n\nsmuggle drugs on airplanes--must be desperately sorry when caught\n\n\n\n      5\n      See also U.S.S.G. Ch. 1 Part A Introduction (2006) (\"Most\nobservers of the criminal law agree that the ultimate aim of the\nlaw itself, and of punishment in particular, is the control of\ncrime.\"); Pell v. Procunier, 417 U.S. 817, 822 (1974) (\"An\nimportant function of the corrections system is the deterrence of\ncrime.\"); United States v. Taylor, ___ F.3d ___, 2007 WL 2349415 at\n*8 (1st Cir. Aug. 17, 2007), petition for cert. filed, No. 07-388\n(U.S. Aug. 21, 2007); S. Rep. No. 98-225, at 91-92 (1983) (even if\nthe defendant will not re-offend, \"the heightened deterrent effect\nof incarceration and the readily perceivable receipt of just\npunishment   accorded   by   incarceration    [are]   of   critical\nimportance\").\n\n                                   -11-\n\fand some probably could persuade judges that they would not re-\n\noffend.   Yet if federally prosecuted, such individuals regularly\n\nreceive substantial jail terms.        To give no significant jail\n\nsentence on account of contrition to a major drug dealer, who has\n\ncaused far more harm with far less excuse, would rarely seem\n\nreasonable.\n\n           Booker has added substantially to the latitude enjoyed by\n\ndistrict judges, but some equality or proportionality of treatment\n\nis still an objective of sentencing and (save in very unusual\n\ncases) extremely wide deviations from the norm can impair that\n\ngoal.   See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(6); United States v. Saez, 444 F.3d\n\n15, 18 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 224 (2006).    Further,\n\nthe lack of any real prison sentence for what is a major crime\n\nwould be very hard for the public to understand, and public\n\nconfidence in enforcement of the law is itself a value.   18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3553(a)(2)(A).\n\n           Sentences with no (or trivial) prison time have been\n\nscrutinized severely on appellate review.       Recently in United\n\nStates v. Taylor, ___ F.3d ___, 2007 WL 2349415 (1st Cir. Aug. 17,\n\n2007), this court vacated a sentence of one-year of community\n\nconfinement for a defendant convicted of aiding and assisting in\n\nthe preparation of false tax returns, which carried a guidelines\n\n\n\n\n                                -12-\n\fsentencing range of 30-37 months. Other first circuit cases are to\n\nthe same effect.6\n\n              This circuit is hardly alone.         For example, in United\n\nStates v. Wallace, 458 F.3d 606, 612-14 (7th Cir.), petition for\n\ncert. filed, No. 06-7779 (U.S. Nov. 13, 2006), the Seventh Circuit\n\nvacated   a    sentence   of   six   months   of   home   confinement   for   a\n\ndefendant convicted of wire fraud where the guidelines sentencing\n\nrange was 24-30 months, the defendant demonstrated extraordinary\n\nremorse and lived an otherwise exemplary life, but where the\n\ndistrict court failed to provide an adequate justification for an\n\nextraordinarily low sentence.7\n\n              Finally, the facts are unhelpful to Milo.          He did not\n\ncommit only a single criminal act on impulse or out of desperate\n\nneed; instead, already earning a good living, he engaged in a large\n\n\n\n     6\n      Tom, 2007 WL 2822908 (disallowing six months of community\nconfinement and 36 months probation for insider trading and\nobstruction of justice carrying a guidelines range of 37-46\nmonths); United States v. Thurston, 456 F.3d 211, 215-20 (1st\nCir.), petition for cert. filed, No. 06-378 (U.S. Sep. 14, 2006)\n(overturning three-month sentence for Medicare fraud carrying a\nguidelines sentencing range of 63-78 months and a statutory maximum\nof 60 months); Smith, 445 F.3d at 5-7 (setting aside 46-month\nsentence for crack distribution carrying a guidelines sentencing\nrange of 100-125 months).\n     7\n      See also United States v. Repking, 467 F.3d 1091, 1094-96\n(7th Cir. 2006) (vacating a one-day jail sentence and six months of\nhome confinement for bank defrauder who substantially assisted the\ngovernment); United States v. Saenz, 428 F.3d 1159, 1162-65 (8th\nCir. 2005) (vacating a 20-month sentence for defendant convicted of\nmarijuana distribution where the guidelines range was 63-78 months,\nand defendant assisted the government).\n\n                                      -13-\n\fnumber of drug transactions over a substantial period, even though\n\nthe government chose to charge them as a single conspiracy count.\n\nIn sum, the problem with contrition as justifying so low a sentence\n\nis not the lack of explanation by the district court; it is the\n\nresult.\n\n          Milo's cooperation is an entirely different matter.        One\n\nthing that both statute and guidelines do reward is helping the\n\ngovernment.    This   is   not   because   helping   necessarily   shows\n\ncontrition or other virtues (although it might be evidence) but\n\nbecause, in the view of Congress and the Sentencing Commission,\n\nassisting law enforcement is often critical to detecting and\n\ndeterring crime, and punishing offenders.8      In this grim calculus,\n\ndrug kingpins may suffer little while subordinates serve long\n\nsentences.\n\n          Once the government moves under the guidelines or statute\n\nbased on substantial assistance, the district court is not bound by\n\nthe government's recommendation as to how much of a reduction is\n\nproper.   United States v. Martin, 455 F.3d 1227, 1235 (11th Cir.\n\n2006); United States v. Mariano, 983 F.2d 1150, 1157 (1st Cir.\n\n1993); U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1(a).       But there are reasons for giving\n\n\n     8\n      See United States v. Mariano, 983 F.2d 1150, 1155 (1st Cir.\n1993); Frank O. Bowman, III & Michael Heise, Quiet Rebellion?\nExplaining Nearly a Decade of Declining Federal Drug Sentences, 86\nIowa L. Rev. 1043, 1117 (2001); John R. Steer & Paula K. Biderman,\nImpact of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines on the President's\nPower to Commute Sentences, 13 Fed. Sent'g Rep. 154, 155 (2000-\n2001).\n\n                                  -14-\n\fweight to its recommendations and, like any other factor relied on\n\nby a sentencing judge, the judge's own adjustment is reviewable for\n\nreasonableness.   Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 518.\n\n          Two central realities have to be considered: first, that\n\nthe adjustment is usually a discount from the otherwise appropriate\n\nsentence and, second, that the discount itself has costs: in\n\nreducing protection of society from the defendant, in deterring\n\nothers, in lessening public confidence in the law's insistence on\n\njust deserts, and in undercutting equal treatment vis-a-vis those\n\nwho similarly offended but happen to have nothing to trade.\n\n          Congress, the Sentencing Commission and most judges think\n\nthat the benefits of cooperation are worth paying a price; but\n\nbecause the costs are inherent, the public interest often suggests\n\ndiscounting the defendant's sentence no more than is necessary to\n\nelicit the needed help.   In any event understanding this tension\n\nbetween costs and benefits helps explain why a zero jail-time\n\nsentence for a major crime is highly suspect and also why the\n\nprosecutor's judgment as to the right discount, if not impeached,\n\nis worth careful attention.\n\n          Ordinarily, one facing a long prison sentence has a\n\nstrong incentive to cooperate in exchange for a reduced sentence.\n\nHow to measure cooperation is not straightforward.       Partly to\n\nassure real and not half-hearted cooperation, the government wants\n\nto correlate the discount with results and results vary; the\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fdefendant wants compensation for the costs entailed by cooperation,\n\nespecially      danger,   also    a   variable.    Still,   usually       needed\n\nassistance can be elicited by some discount well short of 100\n\npercent.\n\n            Published data on the distribution of reductions tends to\n\nbe gross, but the most recent median decrease below the guidelines\n\nminimum    in   drug   trafficking      cases   where   there   was   a   5K1.1\n\nsubstantial assistance motion was 40 months or 43.5 percent below\n\nthe guideline minimum.      U.S. Sentencing Commission, 2006 Source of\n\nFederal Sentencing Statistics, tbl. 30; see also 2005 Source of\n\nFederal Sentencing Statistics, tbl. 30 (38.5 months or 46.2% below\n\nthe guidelines minimum).         Here, the government's recommendation as\n\nto Milo was in line with such data.\n\n            True, a prosecutor could overvalue or undervalue the\n\ncooperation provided; the prosecutor's interest in the immediate\n\nbenefits of cooperation may suggest that the former is the greater\n\ndanger.9     But in general the government has both incentive and\n\nexpertise to recommend what is needed to secure cooperation.                And\n\nboth the prosecutor and defense counsel in a district benefit from\n\n\n\n     9\n      See, e.g., Michael A. Simons, Retribution for Rats:\nCooperation, Punishment, and Atonement, 56 Vand. L. Rev. 1, 23-24\n(2003) (noting risk of prosecutor's overvaluing of additional\nconvictions and undervaluing of general deterrence); Ian Weinstein,\nRegulating the Market for Snitches, 47 Buff. L. Rev. 563, 564-65\n(1999) (arguing that prosecutors and defendants do not internalize\nthe social costs of cooperation--such as increased sentencing\ndisparities).\n\n                                       -16-\n\fa stable and predictable set of likely adjustments based on help\n\nprovided and danger entailed.\n\n               Where minimal prison sentences have been imposed in major\n\ndrug cases based on cooperation, circuit courts have not been\n\nreluctant to overturn them.10           At the very least, where a district\n\ncourt varies widely from the government's recommendation in the\n\n\"substantial assistance\" context, the district court should have\n\nsome    good    explanation     as    to    why        it   values   the   defendant's\n\ncooperation far more highly than did the government.                        See United\n\nStates v. Dalton, 404 F.3d 1029, 1033 (8th Cir. 2005).\n\n               In   this    case,    Milo       gave    substantial    help    to   the\n\ngovernment, and one can infer that some risk was involved.                     But the\n\ngovernment ordinarily insists on results to justify any assistance\n\nreduction; results will often involve risks; and the district court\n\nsaid nothing of substance here to explain why the result or the\n\nrisk    in   this    case    warranted      a    near-zero      sentence.      Indeed,\n\nassistance was stressed less than contrition, and contrition was\n\nnot justification for so low a sentence.\n\n\n\n       10\n      See United States v. Desselle, 450 F.3d 179, 181 (5th Cir.\n2006), cert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 1148 (2007) (reversing an 87-month\nsentence for money laundering and cocaine distribution where\nguidelines range was 262-327 months and the government 5K1.1 motion\nrecommended an adjusted range of 210-262 months); United States v.\nCoyle, 429 F.3d 1192 (8th Cir. 2005) (reversing a 36-month sentence\nfor methamphetamine distribution, where guidelines range was 135-\n168 months, and the government recommended a 15% reduction for\ndefendant's cooperation).\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\f            So far as based on assistance, the facially surprising\n\nsentence in this case lacks the \"plausible explanation\" needed\n\nunder Jimenez-Beltre.      Even taking account of both cooperation and\n\ncontrition, it is far from clear that adequate basis could be\n\nfurnished for a near-zero prison sentence. Anyway, explanation, or\n\nthe choice among sentences meaningfully above the zero level, are\n\nin the first instance matters for the district judge on remand.\n\n            The sentence is vacated and the matter remanded to the\n\ndistrict    court   for   further   proceedings   consistent   with   this\n\ndecision.   If Milo is not a flight risk, the district court may let\n\nhim remain free pending re-sentencing on such terms as the district\n\ncourt thinks proper.\n\n            It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\f",

This is an appeal by the government\n\ncontesting the sentence imposed by the district court on Gary Milo.\n\nMilo was arrested in 2003 for trafficking in marijuana.               He\n\nthereafter agreed to plead guilty and assist the government in\n\npending investigations.    The government in turn agreed, subject to\n\ngetting substantial cooperation, to file a motion for a reduced\n\nguideline sentence, U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1, and a sentence below the\n\nmandatory minimum, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(e) (2000).\n\n          On April 29, 2004, Milo pled guilty to a sealed one-count\n\ninformation   alleging    conspiracy   to   possess   with   intent   to\n\ndistribute and to distribute marijuana in violation of 21 U.S.C. §\n\n846 (2000).    The information described Milo's role in heading a\n\nlarge-scale marijuana distribution operation in Massachusetts,\n\nspanning four years and involving \"1,000 kilograms or more\" of\n\nmarijuana.    Forfeiture of Milo's proceeds from the operation was\n\nsought as well.   21 U.S.C. § 853.\n\n          As is common in such cases, sentencing was deferred while\n\nMilo assisted investigators.    In May 2006, the cooperation having\n\nbeen completed, the probation officer prepared the pre-sentence\n\nreport, and the government filed its promised motion.          The PSR\n\nfound Milo accountable for over 6,000 kilos of marijuana; it found\n\nthat the conspiracy had been an extensive one involving five or\n\nmore participants; and it found that Milo himself had directed at\n\nleast two individuals to transport marijuana or drug proceeds.        It\n\n\n                                 -2-\n\falso noted that while under supervision Milo had tested positive\n\nfor cocaine on one occasion.\n\n            Milo, born in 1955, was described in the PSR as having\n\nbeen brought up in an upper middle class home, although it said\n\nthat he had suffered some abuse.            He was married, had attended but\n\nnot graduated from college and had learned building design from his\n\nfather. He had a builder's license and a realtor's license and had\n\nworked in both fields and estimated his income (apart from drugs)\n\nat $50,000 a year.         His estimated net worth slightly exceeded $2.5\n\nmillion.\n\n            The PSR calculated the mandatory minimum sentence as 10\n\nyears, 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(A)(vii), and the guidelines range as\n\n151 to 188 months.         The calculation reflected a base offense level\n\nof 34 premised on the 6,000 kilos and no prior criminal history.\n\nAn upward three-level adjustment for role in the offense matched an\n\nequal reduction for acceptance of responsibility.                   U.S.S.G. §§\n\n3B1.1(b),     3E1.1.        Milo    objected    that   the   kilo   amount   was\n\noverstated; the probation officer said that it did not affect the\n\ncalculation.\n\n            In its promised motion, the government described Milo's\n\ncooperation     in     a   number    of   different    investigations.       The\n\ngovernment moved both for relief from the mandatory minimum, 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3553(e), and from the otherwise applicable guideline\n\nsentence, U.S.S.G. § 5K1.1, and proposed to recommend a sentence of\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\f75   months,    approximately      half   of   the   guideline   minimum    as\n\ncalculated by the probation officer.\n\n             Letters were submitted by those who knew Milo.                They\n\ndescribed him (with detailed examples) as a caring and decent\n\nperson, helpful to others; set forth his work since his arrest for\n\nHabitat for Humanity and other charitable endeavors; attested to\n\nhis contrition; expressed confidence that he would never repeat his\n\ncrime; and, in many cases, expressed hope that he would not have to\n\nserve time in prison.\n\n             At sentencing, Milo's experienced counsel said he had\n\nseen few examples of such complete remorse and urged that Milo be\n\ngiven no time in prison.       The prosecutor agreed that Milo had done\n\n\"a   great   job\"   and   helped   the    government   \"in   significant   and\n\nimportant ways.\"          But, she said, Milo had brought thousands of\n\npounds of marijuana into the district over a number of years, and\n\n75 months was a \"generous\" reduction from the ordinary guideline\n\nsentence.\n\n             After Milo spoke, expressing contrition and saying that\n\nhe had sought to turn his life around, the district court said that\n\nit would accept defense counsel's recommendation.                  The judge\n\nreferred without elaboration to Milo's \"extraordinary\" cooperation\n\nand the force of the letters in the record and said that the 18\n\ndays already spent by Milo in detention and the prospect of a very\n\nlarge forfeiture yet to be computed counted as punishment.\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f             The court then sentenced Milo to time served, five years\n\nof supervised release with the first six months to be served in a\n\ncommunity corrections facility, and a fine of $50,000. Thereafter,\n\nin denying a government motion for reconsideration, the district\n\ncourt rejected any suggestion that the government should have been\n\nsurprised by the sentence and elaborated on what the court said was\n\nalready in the record before the sentencing hearing:\n\n             The sentencing concerned the extraordinary\n             nature of Mr. Milo's cooperation as described\n             in the government's presentation. But it also\n             concerned the extent to which Mr. Milo had\n             changed his life, the steps he had taken in\n             his work, steps which effectively increased\n             the amount of money the government was likely\n             to recover on forfeiture, and his exemplary\n             work with Habitat for Humanity.\n\n             In discussing the government's objections, the court said\n\nthat   the    Milo   sentencing   was   about   contrition   as   well   as\n\ncooperation; that many defendants bargain and cooperate as a kind\n\nof \"business arrangement\" but that Milo was genuinely remorseful\n\nand \"had changed his life (addressing his addictions, working for\n\nHabitat for Humanity, etc.).\"       The court referred briefly to the\n\nlarge forfeiture judgment expected. It agreed with defense counsel\n\nthat Milo was \"someone who the Court will never see again.\"\n\n             The government has now appealed to this court, arguing\n\nprimarily that the sentence is unreasonably low: specifically, that\n\n\"the district court sentenced a major marijuana dealer to time-\n\nserved . . . an 18-day term of imprisonment\" even though Milo\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fparticipated in an extensive four-year drug conspiracy yielding him\n\nalmost $10 million.        The government also attacks various of the\n\ndistrict court's statements in support of the sentence as without\n\nsupport or resting upon factors not properly considered.\n\n               We review sentences primarily for reasonableness, United\n\nStates v.

Two cases are currently\npending in the Supreme Court involving appellate review of district\ncourt departures from the Sentencing Guidelines. Gall v. United\nStates, No. 06-7949 (argued October 2, 2007); Kimbrough v. United\nStates, No. 06-6330 (argued October 2, 2007).\n       2\n        The PSR calculated a total offense level of 34 based in part\non    Milo's distribution of between 3,000 and 10,000 kilos of\n\n                                    -6-\n\fmulti-year sentence and, without a motion, the statutory mandatory\n\nminimum would be 10 years; the sentence imposed amounts to almost\n\nno time in prison.             The main question posed by the government's\n\nappeal    is    the    adequacy,        given   circumstances        and   the   court's\n\nexplanation, of such a sentence for a major drug crime that is\n\nordinarily heavily punished by a sentence of 10 to 15 years.\n\n               Three       subsidiary    government      arguments     warrant     brief\n\nattention.      The first is that the district court improperly relied\n\non the large forfeiture order (ultimately $9.9 million), which by\n\nstatute    must       be    imposed     \"in   addition    to   any    other      sentence\n\nimposed.\"      21 U.S.C. § 853(a) (emphasis added); see also 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3554.   But the statute does not say that the forfeiture can never\n\nbe considered by the district court in determining the overall\n\nsentence, and here the forfeiture was calculated on estimated\n\nproceeds (not profits) and so has punitive characteristics.\n\n               At the same time, one could hardly give the forfeiture in\n\nthis case much weight.            Given his net worth of $2.5 million, Milo\n\nmay never be able to pay the full forfeiture.                        And if Milo had\n\nindependent means, avoiding a prison sentence on this account would\n\ncreate an appearance that financially successful criminals can buy\n\n\nmarijuana. U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(3).    Apparently because Milo only\nadmitted in the plea agreement to \"over 1,000 kilograms\" of\nmarijuana, the court set the offense level at sentencing as 32,\nU.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(4), yielding a range of 121-151 months. Then,\nthe court used level 29, equating to a range of 87-108.        The\nwritten judgment seemingly arrived at 29 by ignoring the three-\nlevel enhancement for role in the offense.\n\n                                              -7-\n\ftheir way out of prison.

Oct. 1, 2007).                   The district\n\ncourt did not rely heavily on the forfeiture, mentioning it only\n\nbriefly, and we see no error in the district court's apparent\n\ndecision to afford some minor weight to it.\n\n            Second, the government argues that the district court\n\ngave undue emphasis to Milo's charitable activities.                These are a\n\ndiscouraged factor under the Sentencing Guidelines which provide:\n\n\"Military, civic, charitable, or public service; employment-related\n\ncontributions; and similar prior good works are not ordinarily\n\nrelevant    in   determining   whether      a   departure     is    warranted.\"\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5H1.11.     The government does not claim this reliance to\n\nbe impermissible but merely to contribute to the unreasonableness\n\nof Milo's sentence.\n\n            Again, the district court did not place much weight on\n\nthese   activities    to   justify   by    themselves     a   lower   sentence.\n\nRather, the activities (which began after Milo's arrest and were\n\nreal but not extraordinary) appear mainly to have bolstered the\n\ncourt's    judgment   that   Milo    had   turned   his   life     around,   was\n\ngenuinely and not just conveniently contrite and would not re-\n\noffend.    This is perhaps an evidentiary use of post-arrest good\n\nworks to show rehabilitation and colorably a legitimate inference,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\fif not overdone.3         We are not convinced that reliance on this\n\nfactor was overdone here.\n\n              Third, the government suggests that Milo's episode of\n\ncocaine use in 2005 undermines the district court's finding that he\n\nwas truly contrite and would not re-offend.                 We agree that the\n\ncocaine use weighs against the finding that Milo had cleaned up his\n\nact; but the court's finding seemingly rested on Milo's overall\n\nbehavior, his charitable works, the supporting letters, and the\n\nimpression made by Milo in his elocution.              The finding that Milo is\n\nunlikely to re-offend by drug dealing is not clearly erroneous.\n\nSee United States v.

However, the government says it \"is not\npressing this issue on appeal,\" because Milo would be entitled to\n\n                                           -9-\n\fcontrition was real: the issue is how far this warrants a very\n\nlarge reduction in sentence.\n\n           Milo received a three-level adjustment for acceptance of\n\nresponsibility.   The government says that therefore the law has\n\nalready \"to some extent\" given him credit for contrition and that\n\nto wipe out the rest of his sentence on this ground underscores the\n\nunreasonableness of the sentence.   But in practice over 90 percent\n\nof drug traffickers who plead guilty get a two or three level\n\nadjustment, whether truly contrite and unlikely to re-offend or\n\nnot.   U.S. Sentencing Commission, 2005 Sourcebook of Federal\n\nSentencing Statistics, tbl. 19.\n\n           Real contrition, and a low chance of re-offense, can be\n\nsomething more.   From the standpoint of the public, re-offense is\n\na major concern when a defendant is sentenced for a serious crime;\n\nand contrition is sometimes a proxy for a reduced likelihood of re-\n\noffense.   The likelihood of re-offense depends on various factors\n\nin addition to contrition; but the factors are a set of variables\n\nregarding which, especially after Booker, the district court's\n\njudgment deserves weight.\n\n           Yet the weight given contrition cannot be beyond review\n\nfor reasonableness.   Full contrition and even a zero risk of re-\n\noffense engage major concerns of sentencing; incarceration is then\n\n\nrelief from the mandatory minimum under the section 3553(f) \"safety\nvalve,\" allowing the district court's consideration of Milo's\ncontrition in relation to the mandatory minimum.\n\n                               -10-\n\fperhaps not needed to reform that individual, to protect the\n\ncommunity from him and to deter him from committing new offenses.\n\nBut   punishment   is   also   meant   to   deter    others,   affirming   the\n\nseriousness of the crime and the penalties that others will likely\n\nface and the difficulty of avoiding punishment.\n\n           The need to deter others is under federal law a major\n\nelement in criminal sentencing, 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a)(2)(B).5            Given\n\nthat objective, we do not see how, taken alone, or combined with\n\nthe other factors described above, contrition could justify a judge\n\nin imposing what is effectively no prison time on someone like Milo\n\nwho, without duress and simply for personal gain, operated a major\n\nmarijuana ring involving a number of individuals over an extensive\n\nperiod and resulting in the distribution of thousands of pounds of\n\nmarijuana.\n\n           Many    first   offenders    in    drug    distribution   cases--\n\nincluding young and impoverished women from other countries used to\n\nsmuggle drugs on airplanes--must be desperately sorry when caught\n\n\n\n      5\n      See also U.S.S.G.

Biderman,\nImpact of the Federal Sentencing Guidelines on the President's\nPower to Commute Sentences, 13 Fed.

Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d at 518.\n\n          Two central realities have to be considered: first, that\n\nthe adjustment is usually a discount from the otherwise appropriate\n\nsentence and, second, that the discount itself has costs: in\n\nreducing protection of society from the defendant, in deterring\n\nothers, in lessening public confidence in the law's insistence on\n\njust deserts, and in undercutting equal treatment vis-a-vis those\n\nwho similarly offended but happen to have nothing to trade.\n\n          Congress, the Sentencing Commission and most judges think\n\nthat the benefits of cooperation are worth paying a price; but\n\nbecause the costs are inherent, the public interest often suggests\n\ndiscounting the defendant's sentence no more than is necessary to\n\nelicit the needed help.   In any event understanding this tension\n\nbetween costs and benefits helps explain why a zero jail-time\n\nsentence for a major crime is highly suspect and also why the\n\nprosecutor's judgment as to the right discount, if not impeached,\n\nis worth careful attention.\n\n          Ordinarily, one facing a long prison sentence has a\n\nstrong incentive to cooperate in exchange for a reduced sentence.\n\nHow to measure cooperation is not straightforward.       Partly to\n\nassure real and not half-hearted cooperation, the government wants\n\nto correlate the discount with results and results vary; the\n\n\n                               -15-\n\fdefendant wants compensation for the costs entailed by cooperation,\n\nespecially      danger,   also    a   variable.    Still,   usually       needed\n\nassistance can be elicited by some discount well short of 100\n\npercent.\n\n            Published data on the distribution of reductions tends to\n\nbe gross, but the most recent median decrease below the guidelines\n\nminimum    in   drug   trafficking      cases   where   there   was   a   5K1.1\n\nsubstantial assistance motion was 40 months or 43.5 percent below\n\nthe guideline minimum.

Here, the government's recommendation as\n\nto Milo was in line with such data.\n\n            True, a prosecutor could overvalue or undervalue the\n\ncooperation provided; the prosecutor's interest in the immediate\n\nbenefits of cooperation may suggest that the former is the greater\n\ndanger.9     But in general the government has both incentive and\n\nexpertise to recommend what is needed to secure cooperation.                And\n\nboth the prosecutor and defense counsel in a district benefit from\n\n\n\n     9\n      See, e.g., Michael A. Simons, Retribution for Rats:\nCooperation, Punishment, and Atonement, 56 Vand. L. Rev. 1, 23-24\n(2003) (noting risk of prosecutor's overvaluing of additional\nconvictions and undervaluing of general deterrence); Ian Weinstein,\nRegulating the Market for Snitches, 47 Buff. L.

Even taking account of both cooperation and\n\ncontrition, it is far from clear that adequate basis could be\n\nfurnished for a near-zero prison sentence. Anyway, explanation, or\n\nthe choice among sentences meaningfully above the zero level, are\n\nin the first instance matters for the district judge on remand.\n\n            The sentence is vacated and the matter remanded to the\n\ndistrict    court   for   further   proceedings   consistent   with   this\n\ndecision.
