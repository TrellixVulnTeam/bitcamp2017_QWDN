Rivera Camacho on brief for appellant.\n     H.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Katherine Gonzalez-\nValentin, Assistant U.S. Attorney, and Dino Trubiano, Assistant\nRegional Counsel, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                               June 30, 2005\n\f             Per   Curiam.   Claimant     Celia   R.    Tavarez    filed   an\n\napplication for Social Security disability benefits primarily\n\nbased on (1) back pain, (2) carpal tunnel syndrome, and (3) a\n\nmental impairment (depression).           The administrative law judge\n\n(ALJ) determined that although claimant cannot perform her past\n\nwork   due   to    the   skill   level    involved     in   this   work,   she\n\nnonetheless retains the residual functional capacity (RFC) to\n\nperform the exertional demands of medium work (1) which is simple\n\nand unskilled and (2) which does not require frequent bilateral\n\nhandling, fingering, and manipulating.            Relying on the Medical\n\nVocational Guidelines (the Grid), 20 C.F.R. Part 404, Subpart P,\n\nApp. 2, as a framework, the ALJ then concluded that claimant was\n\nnot disabled. The district court upheld the denial of disability\n\nbenefits.\n\n             We agree with the district court concerning claimant's\n\nmental impairment.       Claimant did not seek any treatment for this\n\ncondition until three weeks before the date her insured status\n\nexpired (December 31, 2001), and Dr. Perez, claimant's treating\n\npsychiatrist, did not place any limitations on claimant prior to\n\nthis date.     Indeed, it was not until April 24, 2002, that Dr.\n\nPerez opined that claimant's capacity for work was poor, and it\n\nwas not until March 2003 that Dr. Perez rated claimant as being\n\nmarkedly limited in all areas of mental functioning.               In neither\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\fof these opinions did Dr. Perez state that these limitations had\n\nexisted prior to December 31, 2001.\n\n            As a result, and given the lack of any evidence in the\n\nrecord concerning the effects of claimant's mental impairment on\n\nher ability to function in the workplace during the relevant\n\ntime, the ALJ's conclusion that this impairment is mild was\n\nsupported    by     substantial    evidence.        Similarly,    the   ALJ's\n\ndetermination that claimant's mental condition only affected her\n\nto   the   extent    that   she   was    limited   to   coping   with   simple\n\ninstructions is supported by substantial evidence.               In relation\n\nto this latter determination, the RFC assessment of the non-\n\nexamining clinical psychologist rated claimant as having no\n\nsignificant limitations in dealing with such instructions.                This\n\nassessment further stated that claimant could sustain pace and\n\nattention during a regular work-day or work-week and could\n\npersist in work activities in a sustained manner.\n\n            However, we do agree with claimant that the ALJ's\n\nreliance on the Grid was in error.                 Where a claimant cannot\n\nreturn to her past work, as here, the Commissioner bears the\n\nburden of proving the existence of other jobs in the national\n\neconomy which the claimant is capable of performing.               See Ortiz\n\nv. Secretary of Health and Human Services, 890 F.2d 520, 524 (1st\n\nCir. 1989) (per curiam).          The Grid permits the Commissioner to\n\nsatisfy this burden without having to resort to the testimony of\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fa vocational expert (VE).              Id.     Thus, \"should a nonexertional\n\nlimitation be found to impose no significant restriction on the\n\nrange of    work   a   claimant        is    exertionally       able     to   perform,\n\nreliance on the Grid remains appropriate.\"                    Id.     However, where\n\na claimant has a nonexertional impairment which \"significantly\n\naffects\" the claimant's capacity to perform the full range of\n\nwork he or she is otherwise exertionally capable of performing,\n\nthe   Commissioner        must    carry        her     burden    of    showing         the\n\navailability of jobs in the national economy by other means. Id.\n\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted).                       Usually, this\n\ninvolves obtaining the testimony of a VE.                    Id. at 524.\n\n           Here, the ALJ found that claimant could perform all of\n\nthe exertional requirements of medium work, and such a finding\n\nalso means that claimant is capable of performing the exertional\n\ndemands    of   sedentary        and    light        work.      See    20     C.F.R.    ยง\n\n404.1567(c).       As for claimant's carpal tunnel syndrome -- a\n\nnonexertional impairment -- the ALJ concluded, as noted, that\n\nclaimant   could    not    engage      in    frequent        bilateral      fingering,\n\nhandling, and manipulating.              An uncontradicted RFC assessment\n\nsimilarly found that claimant has limits in her ability to finger\n\n(fine manipulation) and handle (gross manipulation).\n\n            \"Fingering involves picking, pinching, or otherwise\n\nworking primarily with the fingers,\" and the ability to finger\n\n\"is needed to perform most unskilled sedentary jobs.\"                            Social\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fSecurity Ruling (SSR) 85-15, Capability to Do Other Work -- The\n\nMedical-Vocational Rules as a Framework for Evaluating Solely\n\nNonexertional      Impairments,    1985      WL    56857,       at   *7    (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).             See also SSR 83-10, Determining\n\nCapability to Do Other Work -- The Medical-Vocational Rules of\n\nAppendix 2, 1983 WL 31251, at *5 (\"[m]ost unskilled sedentary\n\njobs require good use of the hands and fingers for repetitive\n\nhand-finger    actions\").        \"Handling\"       is   defined       as   \"seizing,\n\nholding, grasping, turning or otherwise working primarily with\n\nthe whole hand or hands,\" and handling is \"required in almost all\n\njobs.\"   SSR 85-15, 1985 WL 56857, at *7.                 See also SSR 83-14,\n\nCapability to Do Other Work -- The Medical-Vocational Rules as a\n\nFramework    for    Evaluating    a    Combination         of    Exertional      and\n\nNonexertional      Impairments,    1983      WL   31254,    at       *2   (grasping,\n\nholding, and turning are required \"at all exertional levels\").\n\n\"Significant limitations of . . . handling, therefore, may\n\neliminate a large number of occupations a person could otherwise\n\ndo.\"   SSR 85-15, 1985 WL 56857, at *7.\n\n             The   question,     then,      is    whether       an   inability     to\n\nfrequently finger and handle \"significantly affects\" claimant's\n\ncapacity to perform the full range of work at all of the relevant\n\nexertional levels -- sedentary, light, and medium.                        See Ortiz,\n\n890 F.2d at 524.        The ALJ thought not as he concluded that\n\nclaimant's    ability    to    perform      at    least     medium        work   \"was\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fsubstantially intact and was not compromised by any nonexertional\n\nlimitations.\"        The problem is that we cannot determine from the\n\nrecord      the    basis    for   the      ALJ's   conclusion     that   claimant's\n\nincapacity         for     frequent     fingering     and    handling       did   not\n\nsignificantly affect the range of work in which she could engage.\n\nAs   SSR     85-15       points   out,      \"[v]arying     degrees    of    [manual]\n\nlimitations . . . have different effects, and the assistance of\n\na    [VE]    may     be    needed     to    determine      the    effects    of   the\n\nlimitations\".        1985 WL 56857, at *7.          Since at least the ability\n\nto handle is required for most jobs, it seems obvious to us that\n\nthe ALJ should have consulted some expert source to determine\n\nwhat kinds of jobs remained for a person incapable of frequently\n\nengaging in such an activity.\n\n              Further complicating the ALJ's reliance on the Grid is\n\nhis failure to mention any limits on claimant's ability to stoop\n\nand crouch.        According to the only RFC assessment in the record,\n\nclaimant      can        only   occasionally       stoop    and    crouch.        The\n\nconsultative neurologist who examined claimant also noted that\n\nclaimant's range of motion was limited in forward bending.\n\n              \"[T]o perform the full range of medium work . . . , a\n\nperson must be able to do both frequent stooping and frequent\n\ncrouching -- bending both the back and the legs.\"                    SSR 83-14, at\n\n*5 (emphasis added). Plainly, then, an ability to engage in only\n\noccasional stooping and crouching limits the range of medium work\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fthat claimant can perform.        The addition of restrictions on\n\nclaimant's capacity for stooping and crouching makes this case\n\neven more complex and provides another reason why the use of the\n\nGrid may have been problematic here.       See id. at *4 (\"[i]n more\n\ncomplex situations, the assistance of a vocational resource may\n\nbe necessary\").\n\n            Finally, we think that the ALJ's determination that\n\nclaimant's back pain was only mild is not well-supported.              As\n\nreasons for discrediting the severity of this pain, the ALJ\n\nstated that the record was devoid of any x-rays or other tests\n\nwhich established conditions -- such as bulging discs, herniated\n\ndiscs, pinched nerves, or radiculopathy -- which can cause severe\n\npain.   However, two x-rays, one taken in 1999 and the other in\n\n2001, showed that claimant suffered from sacralization at her L5\n\nvertebra.      According   to   the    report   of   the   1999     x-ray,\n\nsacralization is a common cause of low back pain.            Thus, the\n\nrecord, in fact, contains evidence of a condition which could be\n\nexpected to produce more than mild pain.\n\n            Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed in part and vacated in part, and the matter is\n\nremanded to the district court with instructions to remand to the\n\nCommissioner   for   further    proceedings     consistent   with    this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f",

See Ortiz,\n\n890 F.2d at 524.        The ALJ thought not as he concluded that\n\nclaimant's    ability    to    perform      at    least     medium        work   \"was\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fsubstantially intact and was not compromised by any nonexertional\n\nlimitations.\"        The problem is that we cannot determine from the\n\nrecord      the    basis    for   the      ALJ's   conclusion     that   claimant's\n\nincapacity         for     frequent     fingering     and    handling       did   not\n\nsignificantly affect the range of work in which she could engage.\n\nAs   SSR     85-15       points   out,      \"[v]arying     degrees    of    [manual]\n\nlimitations . . . have different effects, and the assistance of\n\na    [VE]    may     be    needed     to    determine      the    effects    of   the\n\nlimitations\".        </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">56857</span></span><pre class=\"inline\">, at *7.          Since at least the ability\n\nto handle is required for most jobs, it seems obvious to us that\n\nthe ALJ should have consulted some expert source to determine\n\nwhat kinds of jobs remained for a person incapable of frequently\n\nengaging in such an activity.\n\n              Further complicating the ALJ's reliance on the Grid is\n\nhis failure to mention any limits on claimant's ability to stoop\n\nand crouch.        According to the only RFC assessment in the record,\n\nclaimant      can        only   occasionally       stoop    and    crouch.        The\n\nconsultative neurologist who examined claimant also noted that\n\nclaimant's range of motion was limited in forward bending.\n\n              \"[T]o perform the full range of medium work . . . , a\n\nperson must be able to do both frequent stooping and frequent\n\ncrouching -- bending both the back and the legs.\"                    SSR 83-14, at\n\n*5 (emphasis added). Plainly, then, an ability to engage in only\n\noccasional stooping and crouching limits the range of medium work\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\fthat claimant can perform.        The addition of restrictions on\n\nclaimant's capacity for stooping and crouching makes this case\n\neven more complex and provides another reason why the use of the\n\nGrid may have been problematic here.       See id. at *4 (\"[i]n more\n\ncomplex situations, the assistance of a vocational resource may\n\nbe necessary\").\n\n            Finally, we think that the ALJ's determination that\n\nclaimant's back pain was only mild is not well-supported.              As\n\nreasons for discrediting the severity of this pain, the ALJ\n\nstated that the record was devoid of any x-rays or other tests\n\nwhich established conditions -- such as bulging discs, herniated\n\ndiscs, pinched nerves, or radiculopathy -- which can cause severe\n\npain.   However, two x-rays, one taken in 1999 and the other in\n\n2001, showed that claimant suffered from sacralization at her L5\n\nvertebra.      According   to   the    report   of   the   1999     x-ray,\n\nsacralization is a common cause of low back pain.            Thus, the\n\nrecord, in fact, contains evidence of a condition which could be\n\nexpected to produce more than mild pain.\n\n            Based on the foregoing, the judgment of the district\n\ncourt is affirmed in part and vacated in part, and the matter is\n\nremanded to the district court with instructions to remand to the\n\nCommissioner   for   further    proceedings     consistent   with    this\n\nopinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\f</pre>",
