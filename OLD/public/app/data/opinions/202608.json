The principal issue\n\nin this appeal is whether the Longshore and Harbor Workers’\n\nCompensation Act (LHWCA), 33 U.S.C. §§ 901-950, provides a\n\ncovered employer and its insurance carrier with a statutory\n\nright   to     seek     damages      against        an        injured      employee’s\n\nattorneys for legal malpractice in pursuing the employee’s\n\nclaims against a responsible third party.                       We hold the LHWCA\n\nprovides no such right.\n\n                                          I.\n\n             Edgar O. Colón was an employee of Plaintiff ITT\n\nFederal Services Corp. (ITT), stationed at a United States\n\nnaval installation in Puerto Rico.                      He was injured when a\n\nNavy pilot errantly dropped two bombs near the control tower\n\nwhere   Colón    was    working      as    a    target    control         specialist.\n\nColón   suffered       serious      injuries.            As    a       result,   Colón,\n\nthrough his attorneys, Defendants Harry Anduze Montaño and\n\nNoelma Colón Cordovés, filed an administrative compensation\n\nclaim   against        ITT    and    its        insurance          carrier’s      claim\n\nadministrator.        ITT’s insurance carrier is Plaintiff Pacific\n\nEmployers Insurance Co. (PEI).                  Colón sought benefits under\n\nthe Defense Base Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1651-1654, which by its\n\nterms   incorporates         the    LHWCA.        See    id.       §    1651.     Colón\n\neventually settled his compensation claim with ITT and PEI\n\nin exchange for a total benefit package exceeding $305,000.\n\n\n                                          -2-\n\f             Prior to the aforementioned settlement, Defendant\n\nAttorneys      also   filed        suit    in   federal     district       court       on\n\nColón’s behalf under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28\n\nU.S.C. §§ 1346(b), 2401(b), 2671-80.                     The complaint, which\n\nsought   $12    million       in    damages,       named    the   United         States\n\nDepartment of the Navy and ITT as defendants.                        The district\n\ncourt dismissed the tort claims against the Navy because the\n\nFTCA precludes suits against “military departments.”                                See\n\nid. §§ 2671, 2679(a).          Rather, the United States is the only\n\nproper party defendant to a FTCA suit.                     See id. §§ 1346(b),\n\n2674, 2679.      The district dismissed the pendent tort claims\n\nagainst ITT because the LHWCA provided Colón an exclusive\n\nremedy (as against his employer) for his injuries                               See 33\n\nU.S.C. § 905(a).          In the meantime, Colón had settled his\n\nadministrative claim with ITT and PEI.                     Presumably satisfied\n\nwith   his     settlement,         Colón    did    not     seek     to    amend     his\n\ncomplaint to name the United States as a party defendant or\n\nto   appeal    the    district       court’s      judgment.         That    judgment\n\nbecame   final        after    the        FTCA’s     two     year        statute       of\n\nlimitations had expired.              See 28 U.S.C. § 2401(b).\n\n                                          II.\n\n             Over $305,000 in the hole, Plaintiffs ITT and PEI\n\nsubsequently     filed    the       present       suit   alleging        they    had    a\n\nstatutory     right    under       the    LHWCA    to    seek   damages         against\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fDefendants for legal malpractice in pursuing Colón’s FTCA\n\naction against the Government. 1        Relying on our decision in\n\nMoores   v.   Greenberg,   834   F.2d   1105   (1st   Cir.   1987),   the\n\n\n\n    1\n         Plaintiffs further alleged Defendants breached a\nlegal duty owed to them under Puerto Rico law in pursuing\nColón’s FTCA action against the United States. We, like the\ndistrict court, reject any suggestion that Defendants owed\nPlaintiffs such a duty under the circumstances of this case.\nThe general rule is that an attorney owes a duty of care to\na client.   See One Nat’l Bank v. Antonellis, 80 F.3d 606,\n609 (1st Cir. 1996).     Obviously, Plaintiffs do not fit\nwithin the general rule because they are not, nor have they\never been to our knowledge, clients of Defendants. Instead,\nPlaintiffs reference the foreseeable reliance exception to\nthe general rule as the basis of Defendants’ duty to them.\nSee id. (applying Massachusetts law). Under the exception,\na duty to a nonclient may arise if an attorney should\nreasonably foresee that the nonclient will rely upon the\nattorney’s rendering of legal services to the client.    See\nid.   Assuming Puerto Rico law encompasses such exception,\nhowever, no independent duty to a nonclient arises if such\nduty “would potentially conflict with the duty the attorney\nowes to his or her client.”       Id. (internal quotations\nomitted)(emphasis added).   In granting summary judgment to\nDefendants on Plaintiffs’ commonwealth claim, the district\ncourt ably noted two sources of likely conflict between\nPlaintiffs and Colón which foreclosed application of the\nforeseeable reliance exception.      In the administrative\naction, Plaintiffs were adversaries of    Colón.  Defendants\nhad a duty to Colón to seek compensation from Plaintiffs ITT\nand PEI. In the FTCA action, filed while the administrative\naction was still pending, Colón named ITT (plus an unknown\ninsurance company) as a defendant.       This again placed\nDefendants’ client in a position adverse to Plaintiffs.\nLastly, we note that under Plaintiffs’ theory of the case,\nan employee’s instruction to his attorney to discontinue\npursuing an action against a third party tortfeasor would\nnecessarily place that attorney in a quandary if the\nattorney owed a concurrent duty to the nonclient employer\nand its insurance company to continue pursuing the action\nsimply because the latter had met its legal obligation to\npay worker compensation benefits.\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fdistrict court dismissed Plaintiffs’ claim pursuant to Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 12(b)(6), and Plaintiffs appealed.                          Our review is\n\nde novo.    See Isla Nena Air Serv., Inc. v. Cessna Aircraft\n\nCo., 449 F.3d 85, 87 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                         A.\n\n           Subsection          933(b)       of    the    LHWCA,        as     amended,\n\nprovides   a     limited   right       of     subrogation        to    the    employer\n\nwhere its employee recovers under the LHWCA for injuries\n\nproximately caused by a third person:\n\n                  Acceptance of         compensation under an\n\n           award in a compensation order filed by a\n\n           deputy commissioner, an administrative law\n\n           judge,    or     the    [Benefits         Review]          Board\n\n           shall    operate       as    an       assignment      to     the\n\n           employer       of    all     rights      of   the       person\n\n           entitled        to     compensation           to      recover\n\n           damages against such third person unless\n\n           such     person      shall        commence       an     action\n\n           against     such       third       person     within         six\n\n           months after such acceptance.\n\n\n\n33 U.S.C. § 933(b).             If the employee commences an action\n\nagainst    the    third    person       as       provided     in      the     LHWCA,   a\n\ncorresponding judicially created lien attaches in favor of\n\n\n                                        -5-\n\fthe   employer      for     benefits     paid       up   to   the    amount      of     the\n\nemployee’s        recovery.        See       Edmonds     v.   Compagnie         Generale\n\nTransatlantique,          443     U.S.       256,   269-70         (1979);      Hartford\n\nAccident & Indem. Co. v. Oceancarrier Shipholding, 799 F.2d\n\n1093, 1095-96 (5th Cir. 1986).                      If the employee does not\n\ninstitute suit within the six month period, the employer\n\nthen has ninety days to institute its own suit against the\n\nthird     person.      33    U.S.C.      §    933(b).         If    the    ninety      days\n\nelapses without the employer having filed suit, the right of\n\naction against the third person reverts to the employee.\n\nId.       Where   an   employer’s        insurance       carrier          has   paid    the\n\ncompensation due under the LHWCA, the Act subrogates the\n\nemployer’s rights to the carrier.                    Id. § 933(h).\n\n                                             B.\n\n             According       to     Plaintiffs,          §     933(b)       creates       a\n\n“subrogation lien” in their favor on any legal malpractice\n\nclaim Colón might have against Defendants. 2                           Unfortunately\n\nfor   Plaintiffs,         neither    §   933’s       narrow        language     nor     our\n\nprecedent construing it supports their position. 3                               Section\n\n\n      2\n       Plaintiffs in reality claim a right of subrogation,\nwhich they inartfully label a “subrogation lien,” to any\ncause of action Colón might have against Defendants.\nPlaintiffs’ purported lien remains inchoate because no\nproceeds exist to which it may attach.\n      3\n       As a requisite to § 933(b)’s application, we assume\nthat Colón’s settlement with Plaintiffs for compensation\nbenefits resulted in an “order filed by the deputy\n\n                                         -6-\n\f933    is   entitled          “Compensation        for       injuries       where       third\n\npersons are liable.”              The LHWCA defines the term “injury” as\n\nan “accidental injury. . . arising out of and in the course\n\nof employment . . . .”                 Id. § 902(2); see also id. § 902\n\n(22)     (“The      singular         includes      the       plural     .    .     .     .”).\n\nSubsection (a) of § 933 speaks of third person liability “on\n\naccount of a disability . . . for which compensation is\n\npayable      under        this    chapter     .    .     .    .”      Id.    §     933(a).\n\nSubsection (b) provides under specified circumstances “an\n\nassignment        to    the      employer    of    all       rights   of     the       person\n\nentitled     to     compensation        to   recover         damages     against         such\n\nthird person . . . .”                Id. § 933(b).\n\n             The only “injury” § 933 addresses is the harm Colón\n\nsustained in “the course of employment” – that is, the harm\n\ncaused      by    the      Navy    pilot’s        errant      bombing       of     Colón’s\n\nposition in the control tower.                     The third person liability\n\n§ 933 addresses is the liability of the person or entity\n\ncausing the disability “for which compensation is payable”\n\nunder the LHWCA –                 that is, the liability of the United\n\nStates      under      the    FTCA    for    the    Navy       pilot’s      negligence.\n\nSimply put, the injury, if any, for which Colón’s attorneys,\n\nDefendants,         are    responsible       in    no    sense     occurred         in    the\n\n\ncommissioner, an administrative law judge, or the Board”.\nThe record is silent on this matter and neither party raises\nthe point.\n\n                                            -7-\n\fcourse     of        Colón’s    employment.              Nor        in        any    sense    did\n\nDefendants’            purported        misfeasance             entitle              Colón     to\n\ncompensation          under     the    LHWCA.           Thus,       §    933(b)’s       limited\n\nassignment       of     rights     to    an    employer             does       not    encompass\n\nPlaintiffs’ present claim against Defendants.\n\n            The        result    we     reach       is    consistent                with    First\n\nCircuit precedent.             Albeit in a factually different context,\n\nwe reasoned in Moores, 834 F.2d at 1113, that a maritime\n\nemployer’s compensation lien for benefits paid an employee\n\nunder the LHWCA “died of natural causes when the supposedly\n\nculpable third parties . . . were exonerated” in a third\n\nparty action.           Id.      In upholding an instruction directing\n\nthe jury to reduce any malpractice award by the amount of\n\ncompensation          benefits        paid    the       employee          (an       instruction\n\ndesigned        to    prevent     double       recovery),                we    rejected       the\n\nargument that the employee might “take a double dip from his\n\nexchequer”       because,       according          to    the    employee,            such    lien\n\nwould attach to the proceeds of the employee’s award against\n\nhis former attorney.                  Id.     We explained that a physical\n\ninjury     arising        in     the     course          of     a       covered        worker’s\n\nemployment “is separate and distinct” from a legal injury\n\narising out of an attorney’s misfeasance in pursuing a third\n\nparty    tortfeasor            responsible          for        such           injury.         Id.\n\nConsistent with § 933(b)’s narrow language, we concluded the\n\n\n                                             -8-\n\femployer’s          right   to     reimbursement        for    compensation         paid\n\nextends only to damages recovered for the injury sustained\n\nin the course of employment – “and no further.”                             Id.\n\n              To be sure, two recognized purposes of § 933 are to\n\nprotect       employers      who    incur    absolute       liability       under    the\n\nLHWCA       and     to    place     ultimate        responsibility          upon     the\n\ntortfeasor          whose    negligence          directly     resulted        in    such\n\nliability.          See Louviere v. Shell Oil Co., 509 F.2d 278, 283\n\n(5th       Cir.   1975)     (Wisdom,      J.). 4     That     our    decision      might\n\nostensibly           frustrate         these        purposes,         however,        is\n\ninsufficient reason to ignore the language of § 933 and our\n\nprior precedent.             Prior to the dismissal of Colón’s FTCA\n\nsuit, to which Plaintiff ITT was a party, ITT could have\n\nsought to protect its interests in a number of ways.                               Among\n\nthe    alternatives         available       under    the    rules     of    procedure,\n\nPlaintiffs        could     have    (1)    filed    a   third       party    complaint\n\nagainst       the    United      States,     (2)    filed     a     cross    complaint\n\nagainst the Navy and then moved to substitute the United\n\n\n\n       4\n       Section 933 also reflects a policy of avoiding double\nrecovery.    See Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Director,\nOffice of Workers’ Comp. Programs, 519 U.S. 248, 261 (1997).\nThe possibility of double recovery in this case, however,\nappears remote.   Colón has forfeited his right under the\nFTCA to pursue damages against the United States and, to our\nknowledge, has not sought to recoup his loss through a\nmalpractice action against Defendants.

Col&#243;n was an employee of Plaintiff ITT Federal Services Corp. (ITT), stationed at a United States naval installation in Puerto Rico. He was injured when a Navy pilot errantly dropped two bombs near the control tower where Col&#243;n was working as a target control specialist. Col&#243;n suffered serious injuries. As a result, Col&#243;n, through his attorneys, Defendants Harry Anduze Monta&#241;o and Noelma Col&#243;n Cordov&#233;s, filed an administrative compensation claim against ITT and its insurance carrier's claim administrator. ITT's insurance carrier is Plaintiff Pacific Employers Insurance Co. (PEI). Col&#243;n sought benefits under the Defense Base Act, 42 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1651-1654, which by its terms incorporates the LHWCA. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1651. Col&#243;n eventually settled his compensation claim with ITT and PEI in exchange for a total benefit package exceeding $305,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Prior to the aforementioned settlement, Defendant Attorneys also filed suit in federal district court on Col&#243;n's behalf under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1346(b), 2401(b), 2671-80. The complaint, which sought $12 million in damages, named the United States Department of the Navy and ITT as defendants. The district court dismissed the tort claims against the Navy because the FTCA precludes suits against \"military departments.\" <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 2671, 2679(a). Rather, the United States is the only proper party defendant to a FTCA suit. <i>See id.</i> &#167;&#167; 1346(b), 2674, 2679. The district dismissed the pendent tort claims against ITT because the LHWCA provided Col&#243;n an exclusive remedy (as against his employer) for his injuries <i>See</i> 33 U.S.C. &#167; 905(a). In the meantime, Col&#243;n had settled his administrative claim with ITT and PEI. Presumably satisfied with his settlement, Col&#243;n did not seek to amend his complaint to name the United States as a party defendant or to appeal the district court's judgment. That judgment became final after the FTCA's two year statute of limitations had expired. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2401(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over $305,000 in the hole, Plaintiffs ITT and PEI subsequently filed the present suit alleging they had a statutory right under the LHWCA to seek damages against Defendants for legal malpractice in pursuing Col&#243;n's FTCA action against the Government.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Relying on our decision in <i>Moores v.

If the employee commences an action against the third person as provided in the LHWCA, a corresponding judicially created lien attaches in favor of the employer for benefits paid up to the amount of the employee's recovery. <i>See Edmonds v. Compagnie Generale Transatlantique,</i> 443 U.S. 256, 269-70, 99 S.Ct. 2753, 61 L.Ed.2d 521 (1979); <i>Hartford Accident &amp; Indem. Co. v.

Subsection (a) of &#167; 933 speaks of third person liability \"on account of a disability . . . for which compensation is payable under this chapter . . . .\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 933(a). Subsection (b) provides under specified circumstances \"an assignment to the employer of all rights of the person entitled to compensation to recover damages against such third person . . . .\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 933(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The only \"injury\" &#167; 933 addresses is the harm Col&#243;n sustained in \"the course of employment\" &#8212; that is, the harm caused by the Navy pilot's errant bombing of Col&#243;n's position in the control tower. The third person liability &#167; 933 addresses is the liability of the person or entity causing the disability \"for which compensation is payable\" under the LHWCA &#8212; that is, the liability of the United States under the FTCA for the Navy pilot's negligence. Simply put, the injury, if any, for which Col&#243;n's attorneys, Defendants, are responsible in no sense occurred in the course of Col&#243;n's employment. Nor in any sense did Defendants' purported misfeasance entitle Col&#243;n to compensation under the LHWCA. Thus, &#167; 933(b)'s limited assignment of rights to an employer does <i>not</i> encompass Plaintiffs' present claim against Defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The result we reach is consistent with First Circuit precedent. Albeit in a factually different context, we reasoned in <i>Moores,</i> 834 F.2d at 1113, that a maritime employer's compensation lien for benefits paid an employee under the LHWCA \"died of natural causes when the supposedly culpable third parties . . . were exonerated\" in a third party action. <i>Id.</i> In upholding an instruction directing the jury to reduce any malpractice award by the amount of compensation benefits paid the employee (an instruction designed to prevent double recovery), we rejected the argument that the employee might \"take a double dip from his exchequer\" because, according to the employee, such lien would attach to the proceeds of the employee's award against his former attorney. <i>Id.</i> We explained that a physical injury arising in the course of a covered worker's employment \"is separate and distinct\" from a legal injury arising out of an attorney's misfeasance in pursuing a third party tortfeasor responsible for such injury. <i>Id.</i> Consistent with &#167; 933(b)'s narrow language, we concluded the employer's right to reimbursement for compensation paid extends only to damages recovered for the injury sustained in the course of employment &#8212; \"and no further.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, two recognized purposes of &#167; 933 are to protect employers who incur absolute liability under the LHWCA and to place ultimate responsibility upon the tortfeasor whose negligence directly resulted in such liability. <i>See Louviere v. Shell Oil Co.,</i> 509 F.2d 278, 283 (5th Cir.1975) (Wisdom, J.).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> That our decision might ostensibly frustrate these purposes, however, is insufficient reason to ignore the language of &#167; 933 and our prior precedent. Prior to the dismissal of Col&#243;n's FTCA suit, to which Plaintiff ITT was a party, ITT could have sought to protect its interests in a number of ways. Among the alternatives available under the rules of procedure, Plaintiffs could have (1) filed a third party complaint against the United States, (2) filed a cross complaint against the Navy and then moved to substitute the United States as the proper defendant, or (3) asked the court to join the United States as a defendant and realign the parties to reflect their real interests. At the same time, to protect its interest, Plaintiff PEI could have sought to intervene in Col&#243;n's suit and accompany ITT in its pursuit of the United States. That Plaintiffs chose not to protect their interests in one or more of these ways but instead chose to sue Col&#243;n's attorneys does not provide us license to reach the result they desire.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs further alleged Defendants breached a legal duty owed to them under Puerto Rico law in pursuing Col&#243;n's FTCA action against the United States. We, like the district court, reject any suggestion that Defendants owed Plaintiffs such a duty under the circumstances of this case. The general rule is that an attorney owes a duty of care to a client<i>See One Nat'l Bank v. Antonellis,</i> 80 F.3d 606, 609 (1st Cir.1996). Obviously, Plaintiffs do not fit within the general rule because they are not, nor have they ever been to our knowledge, clients of Defendants. Instead, Plaintiffs reference the foreseeable reliance exception to the general rule as the basis of Defendants' duty to them. <i>See id.</i> (applying Massachusetts law). Under the exception, a duty to a nonclient <i>may</i> arise if an attorney should reasonably foresee that the nonclient will rely upon the attorney's rendering of legal services to the client. <i>See id.</i> Assuming Puerto Rico law encompasses such exception, however, no independent duty to a nonclient arises if such duty \"would <i>potentially</i> conflict with the duty the attorney owes to his or her client.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotations omitted)(emphasis added). In granting summary judgment to Defendants on Plaintiffs' commonwealth claim, the district court ably noted two sources of likely conflict between Plaintiffs and Col&#243;n which foreclosed application of the foreseeable reliance exception. In the administrative action, Plaintiffs were adversaries of Col&#243;n. Defendants had a duty to Col&#243;n to seek compensation from Plaintiffs ITT and PEI. In the FTCA action, filed while the administrative action was still pending, Col&#243;n named ITT (plus an unknown insurance company) as a defendant. This again placed Defendants' client in a position adverse to Plaintiffs. Lastly, we note that under Plaintiffs' theory of the case, an employee's instruction to his attorney to discontinue pursuing an action against a third party tortfeasor would necessarily place that attorney in a quandary if the attorney owed a concurrent duty to the <i>nonclient</i> employer and its insurance company to continue pursuing the action simply because the latter had met its legal obligation to pay worker compensation benefits.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs in reality claim a right of subrogation, which they inartfully label a \"subrogation lien,\" to any cause of action Col&#243;n might have against Defendants. Plaintiffs' purported lien remains inchoate because no proceeds exist to which it may attach</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> As a requisite to &#167; 933(b)'s application, we assume that Col&#243;n's settlement with Plaintiffs for compensation benefits resulted in an \"order filed by the deputy commissioner, an administrative law judge, or the Board\". The record is silent on this matter and neither party raises the point</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Section 933 also reflects a policy of avoiding double recovery<i>See Ingalls Shipbuilding, Inc. v. Director, Office of Workers' Comp. Programs,</i> 519 U.S. 248, 261, 117 S.Ct. 796, 136 L.Ed.2d 736 (1997). The possibility of double recovery in this case, however, appears remote. Col&#243;n has forfeited his right under the FTCA to pursue damages against the United States and, to our knowledge, has not sought to recoup his loss through a malpractice action against Defendants. Thus, &#167; 933's policy against double recovery remain inviolate.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We also note that Plaintiffs may have had other rights of recoupment apart from &#167; 933<i>See Louviere,</i> 509 F.2d 278, 282-84 (holding &#167; 933 does not preempt nonstatutory rights of action an employer may have for compensation payments made to an employee).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

If the employee does not institute suit within the six month period, the employer then has ninety days to institute its own suit against the third person. 33 U.S.C. &#167; 933(b). If the ninety days elapses without the employer having filed suit, the right of action against the third person reverts to the employee. <i>Id.</i> Where an employer's insurance carrier has paid the compensation due under the LHWCA, the Act subrogates the employer's rights to the carrier. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 933(h).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to Plaintiffs, &#167; 933(b) creates a \"subrogation lien\" in their favor on any legal malpractice claim Col&#243;n might have against Defendants.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Unfortunately for Plaintiffs, neither &#167; 933's narrow language nor our precedent construing it supports their position.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Section 933 is entitled \"Compensation for injuries where third persons are liable.\" The LHWCA defines the term \"injury\" as an \"accidental injury . . . arising out of and in the course of employment. . . .\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 902(2); <i>see also id.</i> &#167; 902(22) (\"The singular includes the plural. . . .\"). Subsection (a) of &#167; 933 speaks of third person liability \"on account of a disability . . . for which compensation is payable under this chapter . . . .\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 933(a).

The third person liability &#167; 933 addresses is the liability of the person or entity causing the disability \"for which compensation is payable\" under the LHWCA &#8212; that is, the liability of the United States under the FTCA for the Navy pilot's negligence. Simply put, the injury, if any, for which Col&#243;n's attorneys, Defendants, are responsible in no sense occurred in the course of Col&#243;n's employment. Nor in any sense did Defendants' purported misfeasance entitle Col&#243;n to compensation under the LHWCA. Thus, &#167; 933(b)'s limited assignment of rights to an employer does <i>not</i> encompass Plaintiffs' present claim against Defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The result we reach is consistent with First Circuit precedent. Albeit in a factually different context, we reasoned in <i>Moores,</i> 834 F.2d at 1113, that a maritime employer's compensation lien for benefits paid an employee under the LHWCA \"died of natural causes when the supposedly culpable third parties . . . were exonerated\" in a third party action. <i>Id.</i> In upholding an instruction directing the jury to reduce any malpractice award by the amount of compensation benefits paid the employee (an instruction designed to prevent double recovery), we rejected the argument that the employee might \"take a double dip from his exchequer\" because, according to the employee, such lien would attach to the proceeds of the employee's award against his former attorney. <i>Id.</i> We explained that a physical injury arising in the course of a covered worker's employment \"is separate and distinct\" from a legal injury arising out of an attorney's misfeasance in pursuing a third party tortfeasor responsible for such injury. <i>Id.</i> Consistent with &#167; 933(b)'s narrow language, we concluded the employer's right to reimbursement for compensation paid extends only to damages recovered for the injury sustained in the course of employment &#8212; \"and no further.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, two recognized purposes of &#167; 933 are to protect employers who incur absolute liability under the LHWCA and to place ultimate responsibility upon the tortfeasor whose negligence directly resulted in such liability. <i>See Louviere v. Shell Oil Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"324537\"><a href=\"/opinion/324537/raymond-d-louviere-v-shell-oil-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>, 283 (5th Cir.1975) (Wisdom, J.).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> That our decision might ostensibly frustrate these purposes, however, is insufficient reason to ignore the language of &#167; 933 and our prior precedent. Prior to the dismissal of Col&#243;n's FTCA suit, to which Plaintiff ITT was a party, ITT could have sought to protect its interests in a number of ways. Among the alternatives available under the rules of procedure, Plaintiffs could have (1) filed a third party complaint against the United States, (2) filed a cross complaint against the Navy and then moved to substitute the United States as the proper defendant, or (3) asked the court to join the United States as a defendant and realign the parties to reflect their real interests. At the same time, to protect its interest, Plaintiff PEI could have sought to intervene in Col&#243;n's suit and accompany ITT in its pursuit of the United States. That Plaintiffs chose not to protect their interests in one or more of these ways but instead chose to sue Col&#243;n's attorneys does not provide us license to reach the result they desire.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">AFFIRMED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs further alleged Defendants breached a legal duty owed to them under Puerto Rico law in pursuing Col&#243;n's FTCA action against the United States. We, like the district court, reject any suggestion that Defendants owed Plaintiffs such a duty under the circumstances of this case. The general rule is that an attorney owes a duty of care to a client<i>See One Nat'l Bank v. Antonellis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"715773\"><a href=\"/opinion/715773/one-national-bank-v-joseph-m-antonellis/\"><span class=\"volume\">80</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">606</span></a></span>, 609 (1st Cir.1996). Obviously, Plaintiffs do not fit within the general rule because they are not, nor have they ever been to our knowledge, clients of Defendants. Instead, Plaintiffs reference the foreseeable reliance exception to the general rule as the basis of Defendants' duty to them. <i>See id.</i> (applying Massachusetts law). Under the exception, a duty to a nonclient <i>may</i> arise if an attorney should reasonably foresee that the nonclient will rely upon the attorney's rendering of legal services to the client. <i>See id.</i> Assuming Puerto Rico law encompasses such exception, however, no independent duty to a nonclient arises if such duty \"would <i>potentially</i> conflict with the duty the attorney owes to his or her client.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotations omitted)(emphasis added). In granting summary judgment to Defendants on Plaintiffs' commonwealth claim, the district court ably noted two sources of likely conflict between Plaintiffs and Col&#243;n which foreclosed application of the foreseeable reliance exception. In the administrative action, Plaintiffs were adversaries of Col&#243;n. Defendants had a duty to Col&#243;n to seek compensation from Plaintiffs ITT and PEI. In the FTCA action, filed while the administrative action was still pending, Col&#243;n named ITT (plus an unknown insurance company) as a defendant. This again placed Defendants' client in a position adverse to Plaintiffs. Lastly, we note that under Plaintiffs' theory of the case, an employee's instruction to his attorney to discontinue pursuing an action against a third party tortfeasor would necessarily place that attorney in a quandary if the attorney owed a concurrent duty to the <i>nonclient</i> employer and its insurance company to continue pursuing the action simply because the latter had met its legal obligation to pay worker compensation benefits.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Plaintiffs in reality claim a right of subrogation, which they inartfully label a \"subrogation lien,\" to any cause of action Col&#243;n might have against Defendants.

Col&#243;n has forfeited his right under the FTCA to pursue damages against the United States and, to our knowledge, has not sought to recoup his loss through a malpractice action against Defendants. Thus, &#167; 933's policy against double recovery remain inviolate.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> We also note that Plaintiffs may have had other rights of recoupment apart from &#167; 933<i>See Louviere,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"324537\"><a href=\"/opinion/324537/raymond-d-louviere-v-shell-oil-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">509</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>, 282-84 (holding &#167; 933 does not preempt nonstatutory rights of action an employer may have for compensation payments made to an employee).</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
