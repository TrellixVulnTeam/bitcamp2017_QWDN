After carefully considering the briefs and\n\nrecord on appeal, we affirm the judgment below.1\n\n          In relevant part, the appellant argues that the elements\n\nof claim preclusion were not satisfied because a final judgment on\n\nthe merits was not rendered in his earlier, state action. However,\n\nthe dismissal of the state action as time-barred was a judgment on\n\nthe merits.   See Plaut v. Spendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 228\n\n(1995).   See also DaLuz v.

Although\n\nclaim preclusion may perpetuate inequity in some particular cases,\n\nthe doctrine’s salutary purposes of promoting repose and judicial\n\neconomy would be undermined by making ad hoc determinations of the\n\nequities in individual cases.
