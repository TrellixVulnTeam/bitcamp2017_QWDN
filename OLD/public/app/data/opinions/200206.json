BIDDLE, STROUT & PAYSON, P.A.,\n\n                        Defendants, Appellants.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                    FOR THE DISTRICT OF MAINE\n           [Hon. D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                          Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                 Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n          James M. Bowie with whom Robert C. Hatch and Thompson &\nBowie, LLP were on brief, for appellants.\n          Lee H. Bals with whom Marcus, Clegg & Mistretta, P.A. was\non brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                           November 1, 2002\n\f              LYNCH, Circuit Judge.            A federal jury in Maine found\n\nthat a lawyer and her law firm had simultaneously represented\n\nMurray Keatinge and another person with interests adverse to Murray\n\n(his son Kent) and then compounded the problem by suing Murray on\n\nbehalf of Kent.      For this breach of an attorney's duty of loyalty\n\nand care, the jury awarded damages of $660,000.                   The defense of\n\nattorney Elizabeth Biddle and the firm of Strout & Payson was that\n\nthey had never represented Murray Keatinge; rather, they had only\n\nrepresented Kent: they had represented Kent in the exercise of the\n\npower of attorney granted by Murray, in both the sale of Murray's\n\nhouse   and    the   management     of     Murray's     business.      Defendants\n\ncontended that an attorney's representation of the holder of a\n\npower   of     attorney      can   never       establish     an   attorney-client\n\nrelationship with the grantor of that power.\n\n              The Maine Law Court, in an answer to a question certified\n\nafter the jury rendered this verdict, disposed of that contention\n\nby holding that the issue of the existence of an attorney-client\n\nrelationship is one of fact.             There is no rule in Maine that an\n\nattorney     in   such   a   position    is     never   in   an   attorney-client\n\nrelationship with the grantor of the power and no rule that such an\n\nattorney is always in an attorney-client relationship.                  Estate of\n\nKeatinge v. Biddle, 789 A.2d 1271, 1276 (Me. 2002).\n\n              On appeal the defendants now argue that the trial court's\n\nearlier jury instruction, given without the benefit of the Law\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fCourt's later opinion, was potentially misleading to the jury.           We\n\ntoo have concerns about the instruction.            But that gives the\n\ndefendants no remedy: they failed to preserve the issue as required\n\nby Fed. R. Civ. P. 51, they do not meet the plain error criteria,\n\nand we do not think a corrected jury instruction would have changed\n\nthe outcome.       Defendants also argue that they were entitled to\n\ncertain jury instructions which they did request but which were not\n\ngiven.    The instructions requested would not have been appropriate\n\non the facts of this case and were quite properly rejected.              We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            We take the facts in the light most favorable to the\n\nverdict, save for a neutral recitation of whether the plaintiff's\n\nevidence warranted the instructions requested. See Gray v. Genlyte\n\nGroup, Inc., 289 F.3d 128, 131 (1st Cir. 2002) (evidence offered by\n\neither side may be pertinent to assessing the appropriateness of\n\njury instructions).\n\n            The story of this ill-fated triangle -- father, son, and\n\nlawyer -- reaches back in time.           Murray Keatinge and Elisabeth\n\nKeatinge married and had a son, Kent.          During the marriage they\n\nacquired a house, Greyrocks, in Camden, Maine in 1985.            Two days\n\nbefore she died in 1990, Elisabeth made a will, naming her husband\n\nexecutor,    and   created   the   Keatinge   Revocable   Trust   with   her\n\nhusband.    On her death, her half interest in Greyrocks poured into\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fthe   Revocable   Trust.      In   turn,      in   1996,   Murray    transferred\n\nElisabeth's interest in Greyrocks to a Marital Trust of which he\n\nwas Trustee.      The Marital Trust, of which Murray was the sole\n\nbeneficiary, was set up under the Revocable Trust.                There was also\n\nanother trust under the Revocable Trust: the Family Trust, whose\n\nsole beneficiary was Kent. Under the terms of the Revocable Trust,\n\nMurray, as Trustee, was obligated to fund the Family Trust in the\n\namount of $600,000 within six months of the death of the first of\n\nthe grantors of the Revocable Trust (i.e., Elisabeth).                He did not\n\ndo so.\n\n              It is undisputed that Murray owned at least half of\n\nGreyrocks.      In any event, Greyrocks was held by Murray both\n\nindividually and as Trustee of the Revocable Trust (Marital Trust).\n\nThe jury could have concluded that Murray was the sole owner of\n\nGreyrocks.\n\n             Murray   also   had   a   business,     the   Norumbega       Bed   and\n\nBreakfast (B&B).      As of at least early 1998, half of the record\n\ntitle was held by Murray personally and half was held by the\n\nRevocable Trust (Marital Trust).1            Before late 1997, Kent had been\n\ninvolved in the management of the B&B.\n\n             In August 1997, Biddle brought an action in the Maine\n\nProbate   Court   seeking    to    put   Murray     and    his   assets    into    a\n\n\n\n      1\n      Biddle later took the position                that   Kent     also   had    an\nownership interest in the B&B.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fguardianship and conservatorship.         Biddle had been retained to do\n\nso by Kent, who said he was concerned about the oversight of his\n\nfather's health care and businesses after his father had multiple\n\nby-pass   surgery.    Kent   was    appointed   temporary    guardian   and\n\nconservator September 3, 1997.         During that proceeding, Biddle\n\nnecessarily familiarized herself with Murray's assets. The purpose\n\nof the conservatorship was to protect the estate and assets of the\n\nallegedly incapacitated person, here Murray, as well as to protect\n\nKent's interest in his mother's estate, administered by Murray.\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 18-A, ยง 5-401 (2001). Murray, represented\n\nby different counsel, opposed Kent's petition for conservatorship\n\non September 12, 1997.       Murray said he opposed appointment of\n\neither a guardian or conservator and that even if there were an\n\nemergency, he had given Cecelia Cole a health care power of\n\nattorney and his businesses were run by competent managers.              He\n\nalso said that Kent had a conflict of interest which would render\n\nhim inappropriate to be guardian or conservator and that Kent's\n\ntemporary    appointment   should    be    terminated.      Indeed,   Kent,\n\nrepresented by Attorney Clark Byam (not at Strout & Payson), had\n\njust threatened to sue to remove Murray as a trustee of a family\n\ntrust.    In the fall of 1997, Kent had Biddle withdraw the petition\n\nafter a resolution was apparently worked out by agreement.               On\n\nNovember 29, 1997, apparently as part of the agreement, Murray\n\nappointed Kent to be a co-trustee of the Revocable Trust.             Biddle\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\falso       asked   that   her   firm's    fees    for   the   work   done   on   the\n\nconservatorship be paid out of Murray's estate.2\n\n               Pursuant to the resolution of the probate matter, Biddle\n\nprepared a power of attorney for Murray to execute, authorizing\n\nKent to exercise certain powers.                 This work apparently was also\n\npart of the fee application.             Murray executed the durable power of\n\nattorney on November 28, 1997.                   It gave Kent full power and\n\nauthority to conduct Murray's business and affairs. Included among\n\nthese was the power to borrow money, which Kent ultimately did\n\nemploy.       Kent's authority under the power of attorney went beyond\n\nthe powers he had previously held while helping to manage the B&B.\n\nThere are limits to a durable power of attorney.               The holder is not\n\nentitled to use the grantor's money or property for his own benefit\n\nor to make gifts to himself or others unless the power of attorney\n\nso specifies.       Id. ยง 5-508(b).       This power of attorney did not give\n\nKent such authority.\n\n               That power of attorney was replaced on March 10, 1998 by\n\na new durable power of attorney drafted by another lawyer.                  Though\n\nbroadly consistent with the old power of attorney, the new document\n\nprovided much more detail regarding the scope of Kent's authority.\n\nIt specifically empowered Kent to use his father's income and\n\nprincipal for Murray's support and to conduct Murray's estate\n\n\n\n       2\n     Biddle also asked for a reduction in the fees for counsel\nhired by Murray.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fplanning (in conformance with his father's wishes).     At the same\n\ntime, it specifically forbade Kent from making transfers to himself\n\nnot necessary for his health, education, support, or maintenance;\n\nreceiving compensation for services rendered under the power of\n\nattorney; or disregarding certain provisions of any living will or\n\nrelated document Murray executed.      Murray also executed a simple\n\nwill on March 10, 1998.\n\n          Kent called Murray's lawyer, James Elliott, who had\n\ndrafted the new durable power of attorney and will and asked him to\n\nsend both documents to Biddle.     On March 17, 1998, Elliott sent\n\nthem to Biddle with a cover letter saying that Murray wished only\n\nto have a simple will in effect while he gave thought to a more\n\nextensive estate plan.    Elliot also wrote that he assumed Biddle\n\nwould handle any further estate planning for Murray and that she\n\nshould advise him if that was not the case.     Biddle did not reply\n\nother than to acknowledge receipt. She did retain the originals of\n\nthe second durable power of attorney and the will in her files.\n\n          Using the first power of attorney, Kent retained Biddle\n\nto do work regarding the B&B and Greyrocks.      That work was done\n\nfrom November 1997 to September 1998.        In March 1998, Biddle\n\nanalyzed the financial situation of the B&B in order to secure a\n\nline of credit for it from the Gardner Savings Institution.      The\n\nequity line of credit was to be secured by a third mortgage on both\n\nthe B&B and Greyrocks.    Biddle worked on this project with James\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fAyers, an accountant whom Kent had hired in his capacity as holder\n\nof the power of attorney, to do work for the B&B.                       It can be\n\ninferred that from the bank's point of view, Biddle's work on the\n\nB&B was being performed for Murray, and not for Kent in his own\n\ncapacity.      In    early   1998   Biddle     also   handled     two   employment\n\nquestions and a liquor license issue for the B&B.\n\n            On May 11, the issue of the $600,000 meant to be put into\n\nthe Family Trust for Kent's benefit was apparently addressed when\n\nBiddle proposed, by letter to Murray's lawyer, that the Revocable\n\nTrust execute a note and mortgage to the Family Trust for $600,000\n\nsecured by a mortgage on Greyrocks and the B&B.                   The letter said\n\nshe was acting for Kent Keatinge and asked that Murray execute the\n\nnote, mortgage,       and    an   affidavit    that   he    was   represented   by\n\nseparate counsel.           Murray did so and his lawyer returned the\n\ndocuments on June 1, 1998.          Murray's lawyer had earlier expressed\n\nto Biddle his concerns about the facts that Kent had been appointed\n\nco-trustee while the conservatorship for Murray was pending and\n\nthat Biddle had unofficially raised doubts about the Marital Trust.\n\n            In July 1998 Biddle restructured the B&B to transfer its\n\nownership into a new subchapter S corporation, E.B. Hammond, which\n\nshe had incorporated.         Both Murray and Kent appear to have been\n\nshareholders    of    E.B.    Hammond.        It   also    appears   that   Biddle\n\nstructured matters so that Murray owned half of E.B. Hammond in one\n\nof his capacities and Kent, in some capacity, owned the other half.\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fOne of Murray's theories in the case was that this restructuring\n\nwas not necessary for the management of the B&B and was done in\n\norder to take away Murray's ownership interest.           It was Biddle's\n\nintent that Murray would transfer his ownership interest in the B&B\n\nto E.B. Hammond and that E.B. Hammond would own the B&B.\n\n          Indeed,    in    an   August    13,   1998   memorandum,   Biddle\n\nconcluded that all of Elisabeth Keatinge's estate should have gone\n\nto the Family Trust and none to the Marital Trust.               She also\n\nconcluded that the transfer of Elisabeth's half interest to the\n\nMarital Trust was invalid.          These conclusions were obviously\n\ncontrary to Murray's interests.          Based on these conclusions, she\n\nnamed Murray and the three trusts as the grantors of Greyrocks in\n\nthe Warranty Deed.        She did not call to Murray's attention the\n\nissue on which there was conflict.\n\n          The bulk of plaintiff's complaint dealt with Biddle's\n\nhandling of the sale of Greyrocks.          Greyrocks and Norumbega were\n\ncross-collateralized through Gardner Savings Institution.3           Biddle\n\nhad represented to the Bank that Murray would invest $110,000 of\n\nthe proceeds from Greyrocks in the B&B.         Biddle also told the Bank\n\nthat \"Murray and Kent\" are entitled to these proceeds from the sale\n\nof Greyrocks in equal shares, but did not copy Murray on the\n\nletter.   A jury could find that Murray had not authorized that\n\n\n\n     3\n     Biddle did send a letter to the Bank saying she was\nappearing only on behalf of Kent Keatinge.\n\n                                   -9-\n\frepresentation or the transfer of the $110,000 from the Greyrocks\n\nproceeds.    Biddle also represented to the Bank that Murray needed\n\nsome of the proceeds to pay for his retirement and capital gains\n\ntaxes.\n\n            There is no dispute that Murray owned at least half of\n\nGreyrocks outright at the time of the sale.          Indeed, at the\n\nSeptember 1, 1998 closing, Biddle signed in the space for the\n\nseller's signature as follows: \"Elizabeth Biddle, attorney-in-fact\n\nfor Murray Keatinge.\" She communicated with Murray both before and\n\nafter the sale.     Before the sale she sent him documents for him to\n\nsign and return to her.    He did so.   After the sale, Biddle spoke\n\nwith Murray about the bill -- he questioned her over the telephone\n\nabout the closing statement and its legal fees and the accounting\n\nstatement.     Murray asked for an itemized statement; Biddle never\n\nsent one.     This was the only direct contact between Biddle and\n\nMurray.\n\n             There was reason for Murray to be concerned about the\n\nbill.     Biddle had taken $14,680 from the closing proceeds for her\n\nlegal fees.      But no more than $6,800 of the legal fees were\n\nattributable to the closing.     The discrepancy is not explained by\n\nwork done for the B&B; that was billed separately.      The bill did\n\ninclude fees for work directly against Murray's interests:      that\n\nis, work for legal research on whether Murray had adequately funded\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fa trust established for Kent's benefit, work going back to March\n\n1998.\n\n          The conflict of interests between Kent and Murray was\n\nmade explicit by Biddle in a September 29, 1998 letter to Murray,\n\nafter the closing.   The letter said that Biddle had represented\n\nKent since the guardianship proceedings the prior summer and that\n\nthrough this work and the sale of Greyrocks Biddle had become\n\nfamiliar with Murray and Elisabeth's estate planning.     Murray,\n\nBiddle wrote, had deprived Kent of the benefits he should have\n\nreceived and Kent wanted to resolve the outstanding financial\n\nissues between the two of them.\n\n          Biddle, representing Kent, sued Murray in October 1998\n\nin Superior Court in Maine on claims that Murray had failed as\n\ntrustee to adequately fund a trust established for Kent's benefit.\n\nBiddle used information against Murray which she had obtained in\n\nthe course of the prior representation.\n\n          That lawsuit was settled.   As part of the settlement,\n\nMurray gave up his ownership in E.B. Hammond, which owned the B&B;\n\nsome of Murray's other property was transferred to Kent; Murray\n\nassumed any tax liability from the sale of Greyrocks; and Murray\n\nand Kent executed a mutual release.   The lawsuit was apparently,\n\nfor Murray, the last straw which led to the federal litigation.\n\nThe costs of that settlement and the attorneys fees paid to defend\n\n\n\n\n                              -11-\n\fhimself became a major component of Murray's damages claim in the\n\nfederal litigation.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            Murray brought the federal litigation on October 19,\n\n1999, under the court's diversity jurisdiction. Discovery was\n\ncompleted, including Murray's deposition, when Murray died on\n\nAugust 1, 2000.     His estate subsequently became the plaintiff.\n\n            The   complaint    based    its   legal   malpractice   claim   on\n\nallegations that Biddle did not disclose to Murray her conflict of\n\ninterest;     diverted   for   nefarious      reasons   proceeds    from    the\n\nGreyrocks closing; and failed adequately to represent Murray's\n\ninterests.4    Ultimately, the jury would be instructed that if an\n\n\n     4\n      Specifically, plaintiff made the following allegations: (1)\nthat Biddle failed to disclose to Murray that she should not\nrepresent his interests during the sale of Greyrocks since she was\nsimultaneously advising Kent as to claims he might have against\nMurray for Murray's performance of his duties as a trustee under\nthe Revocable Trust; (2) that without Murray's consent Biddle\nprepared a proposed deed and real estate tax transfer declaration\nwhich included as grantors entities which had no ownership interest\nin Greyrocks; (3) that Biddle escrowed $329,969.17 with the Gardner\nSavings Institution without authority from Murray, and provided for\nthe account to be equally divided between Murray Keatinge and the\nKeatinge Family Trust (of which Kent was a beneficiary); (4) that\nBiddle permitted some of the escrow amounts to be paid to people\nother than Murray; (5) that this diversion of the proceeds from\nGreyrock was done for nefarious reasons -- diverting monies to\nKent, depriving Murray of sums he would need to defend himself\nagainst the lawsuit that Kent was about to bring, and increasing\ntheir own legal fees in that litigation; (6) that Biddle\nmisdirected some $10,000 of the closing proceeds to pay for work\ndone by accountants that was unrelated to the Greyrocks sale and\nthat was for Kent's benefit, adverse to Murray's interests; (7)\nthat Murray had never agreed to invest $110,000 from Greyrocks in\nthe B&B and he could not recover that sum; and (8) that Biddle\n\n                                       -12-\n\fattorney-client relationship existed between Murray and Biddle,\n\nthen there was a breach of Biddle's duties to Murray.   There is no\n\nquestion that there was a breach of the duty of loyalty and\n\ndue care if an attorney-client relationship existed between\n\nMurray and Biddle.    There is also no claim about damages in\n\nthis appeal.\n\n          The trial took four days.    After deliberations, the jury\n\nreturned a verdict finding that the defendants were in breach of\n\ntheir duties to Murray and that the breach had caused Murray\n\n$660,000 in total damages.   The jury also found that Murray had not\n\nnegligently caused his damages.\n\n          After the verdict, on a motion by defendants, the federal\n\ndistrict court certified questions to the Maine Law Court.5     The\n\n\nfailed to adequately represent Murray against Kent's contrary\ninterests.\n     5\n      The judge certified the following three questions to the\nMaine Law Court:\n               A. When the holder of a power of attorney hires a\n          lawyer concerning matters within the scope of the power,\n          can the engagement ever result in an attorney-client\n          relationship between the hired lawyer and the grantor of\n          the power?\n               B.    If yes, is there any change in the proof\n          necessary to demonstrate the existence of such an\n          attorney-client relationship? Specifically, in Board of\n          Overseers of the Bar v. Mangan, 763 A.2d 1189 (Me. 2001),\n          the Law Court adopted the formulation\n              that an attorney-client relationship is created when\n              (1) a person seeks advice or assistance from an\n              attorney, (2) the advice or assistance sought\n              pertains   to    matters   within    the   attorney's\n              professional competence, and (3) the attorney\n\n                                -13-\n\fLaw Court replied:\n\n          In ordinary circumstances, when the holder of a power of\n          attorney retains counsel to assist him in fulfilling his\n          duties, the lawyer has an attorney-client relationship\n          with the holder only. In order to effectively exercise\n          the powers granted to him, the holder of a power of\n          attorney may often need to retain counsel. For example,\n          the holder of a power of attorney is not authorized to\n          appear pro se on behalf of the grantor.\n\n          Thus, the mere retention of counsel by the holder does\n          not by itself create an attorney-client relationship\n          between the attorney and the grantor. There must be some\n          other agreement or arrangement to create the separate\n          attorney-client relationship between the attorney and the\n          grantor.   To hold otherwise would leave the attorney\n          hired to represent the holder of a power of attorney in\n          the untenable position of being subject to ill-defined\n          professional responsibilities and create the reality of\n          conflicting loyalties.\n\nEstate of Keatinge, 789 A.2d at 1275 (internal citations omitted).\n\n          The district court then rejected the motion for a new\n\ntrial and for judgment as a matter of law, holding:\n\n\n              expressly or impliedly agrees to give or actually\n              gives the desired advice or assistance.\n          Id. at 1192-93 (citations and quotation marks omitted).\n          When the holder of the power engages the lawyer, is it\n          appropriate to modify the first of the three requirements\n          so as not to require the grantor personally to seek the\n          advice or assistance, but rather to require that the\n          lawyer be asked for advice or assistance \"on behalf of\n          the grantor\"?\n               C. With respect to the third requirement taken from\n          Mangan, is the Law Court disposed to adopt the\n          Restatement (Third) of the Law Governing Lawyers\n          ยง 14(1)(b) (1998) alternative formulation that it is\n          sufficient on that element if the lawyers failed to\n          manifest lack of consent to provide legal services when\n          they knew or reasonably should have known that the\n          grantor reasonably relied on them to provide the\n          services.\n\n\n                               -14-\n\f           I instructed the jury that they could find an attorney-\n           client relationship only if they found, among other\n           things, that the lawyer(s) \"knew or should have known\n           that Murray Keatinge was relying upon them for legal\n           counsel.\"   On the evidence, the jury did not have to\n           reach that conclusion, but it certainly could.     Among\n           other things, Murray Keatinge had talked directly to\n           Attorney Biddle about the size of her bill, and Attorney\n           Biddle had direct correspondence with him in connection\n           with a real estate closing.\n\nKeatinge v. Biddle, 188 F. Supp. 2d 3, 4 (D. Me. 2002) (order).\n\n                                III.\n\n           Because this appeal focuses on the jury instructions\n\ngiven, we initially describe them and the colloquy and objections\n\nmade.   The court instructed:\n\n           On the question whether Murray Keatinge had an\n           attorney/client relationship with the lawyers, the\n           plaintiff Cecelia Cole bears the burden of proof. To\n           proceed, she must show each of the following three things\n           by a preponderance of the evidence:\n\n                  (a) That the lawyers were asked for advice or\n                  assistance on behalf of Murray Keatinge;\n\n                  (b)   That the advice or assistance related to\n                  legal matters;\n\n                  (c)   That the lawyers expressly or impliedly\n                  agreed to give the desired advice or assistance\n                  on behalf of Murray Keatinge, or failed to\n                  demonstrate that they did not agree when they\n                  knew or reasonably should have known that Murray\n                  Keatinge reasonably relied on them to provide the\n                  services. That is, Cecelia Cole must show that\n                  Elizabeth Biddle and/or Strout & Payson knew or\n                  should have known that Murray Keatinge was\n                  relying upon them for legal counsel.\n\n           You should consider all the facts and circumstances. An\n           attorney/client relationship may be created expressly, or\n           it may be implied from the conduct of the parties.\n\n\n                                -15-\n\fThis was a reworking of the standard set by Board of Overseers of\n\nthe Bar v. Mangan, 763 A.2d 1189 (Me. 2001).\n\n           Though neither party contested the relevance of the\n\nMangan   standard,    both   parties     objected   to   the   court's    jury\n\ninstructions.    The plaintiff objected that the court should have\n\ndelivered proposed jury instructions providing, first, that an\n\nattorney retained by a guardian or conservator owes a fiduciary\n\nduty to the ward as well as to the guardian and, second, that\n\ncounsel to the holder of a power of attorney represents and owes a\n\nduty of care to the grantor of the power of attorney (as well as to\n\nthe   holder).       The   defendants    objected   that   the    court      had\n\neffectively instructed the jury that the holder's counsel always\n\nhas a relationship with the grantor -- when, in fact, it should\n\nhave instructed      the   jury   that   holder's   counsel    never   has    an\n\nattorney-client relationship with the grantor.\n\nA.    The \"On Behalf Of\" Instruction\n\n           The defendants argue that the jury instruction as given:\n\n(1) permitted the jury to find that an attorney asked to provide\n\nrepresentation to a holder of a power of attorney would, by that\n\nfact, create an attorney-client relationship, because by definition\n\nthe holder is usually acting for the benefit of the grantor of the\n\npower of attorney; and (2) did not tell the jury that mere\n\nretention of counsel by the holder does not by itself create an\n\nattorney-client relationship with the grantor.             This, they say,\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fcontravenes the Law Court's holding that the mere retention of\n\ncounsel by the holder does not by itself create an attorney-client\n\nrelationship.    Estate of Keatinge, 789 A.2d at 1275-76.   We agree\n\nthat the instruction given had some potential to be misleading on\n\ncertain facts.\n\n          Nonetheless, Biddle's attorney failed to preserve his\n\nobjection to the trial judge's jury instructions.     \"The governing\n\nrule provides that a party cannot assign as error the giving of or\n\nfailure to give an instruction 'unless that party objects thereto\n\nbefore the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly\n\nthe matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.'     Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 51.\"    Genlyte, 289 F.3d at 133-34.   The objection \"must be\n\nsufficiently specific to bring into focus the precise nature of the\n\nalleged error.\"    Cyr v. B. Offen & Co., 501 F.2d 1145, 1155 (1st\n\nCir. 1974) (quoting Palmer v. Hoffman, 318 U.S. 109, 119 (1942)).\n\nThe purpose of this requirement is to help trial courts correct\n\nerrors in jury instructions, Broderick v. Harvey, 252 F.2d 274, 276\n\n(1st Cir. 1958), -- and thus to avoid unnecessary appeals.\n\n          To maximize the likelihood that errors can be corrected\n\nat the trial court level, parties objecting to a trial judge's\n\ninstruction must not only identify the error but also \"proffer a\n\ncorrect instruction or [otherwise] explain how the alleged error in\n\nthe charge could be corrected.\" Scarfo v. Cabletron Sys., Inc., 54\n\nF.3d 931, 944 (1st Cir. 1995); see id. at 946 (\"In general,\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fobjections to a trial judge's charge to the jury must be clear\n\nenough and explicit enough to tell the trial judge what the party\n\nwishes the trial judge to say in order to correct the alleged\n\nerror.\"); Linn v. Andover Newton Theological Sch., Inc., 874 F.2d\n\n1, 5 (1st Cir. 1989) (\"If there is a problem with the instructions,\n\nthe judge must be told precisely what the problem is, and as\n\nimportantly,     what   the    attorney   would         consider    a   satisfactory\n\ncure.\").   The proposed correction must not substantially overstate\n\nthe law in favor of the objecting party.                Parker v. City of Nashua,\n\n76 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 1996).                It is this latter part of the\n\ndistinctness requirement (the proffering of a satisfactory cure)\n\nwhich defendants do not meet.\n\n            After the judge finished instructing the jury, Biddle's\n\nattorney objected to the formulation of the first prong of the\n\nstandard for determining whether an attorney-client relationship\n\nexists.    \"By   leaving      that    prong    as   phrased,        the   court    has\n\neffectively held and instructed the jury that representation [by an\n\nattorney] of a representative [i.e., the holder of the power of\n\nattorney] is representation of the protected party [i.e., the\n\ngrantor]. Because necessarily, the representative [or holder] is\n\nacting on behalf of the protected party [or grantor].\"                    But Biddle\n\ndid not ask that the court instruct that there was no rule that an\n\nattorney   retained     by    the    holder    of   a    power     of   attorney   was\n\nautomatically in an attorney-client relationship with the grantor\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fof a power of attorney.    Rather, Biddle's position throughout was\n\nthat an attorney-client relationship can never arise under these\n\ncircumstances. Biddle's argument was that under Mangan, Murray had\n\nto directly ask Biddle for the service.   And that argument is quite\n\nwrong; further, it did not distinctly notify the court of the\n\nargument Biddle now makes.     She then compounded the problem by\n\ninsisting that an instruction be given that when a representative\n\nretains a lawyer, the client is the representative, and not the\n\nparty for whom the representative is working.\n\n          Our view that defendants did not distinctly state the\n\nview they now advance is reinforced by the trial judge's reaction.\n\nThe trial judge rejected defendants' objection, observing:\n\n          [T]he defendant takes the . . . extreme . . . position\n          that the client holder of the power is automatically the\n          client only, and it cannot be the grantor.      I think\n          that's also an incorrect statement of the law. And so\n          I'm rejecting those particular objections.\n\n                 . . . .\n\n                 . . . Essentially, what the plaintiff has\n          maintained here is that the grantor of a power of\n          attorney is automatically the client of anybody the\n          holder of the power consults at least in matters covered\n          by the power.\n\n                 And the defendant essentially contends that the\n          grantor is never the client in such circumstances.\n          Clearly   my  charge  has   rejected  both   of  these\n          alternatives.\n\n          The Maine Law Court's response to certified question one,\n\nsee Estate of Keatinge, 789 A.2d at 1275-76, confirms that the\n\ndistrict court judge correctly rejected this extreme position.\n\n                                -19-\n\fDefendants proposed a \"cure\" which was substantively wrong and in\n\ndoing so did not give the trial judge fair notice of the real\n\nproblem.\n\n            In the absence of a properly preserved objection, this\n\ncourt reviews the trial judge's jury instructions under the plain\n\nerror standard.          Genlyte, 289 F.3d at 134.         The party claiming\n\nplain error is required to demonstrate \"(1) that there was error,\n\n(2) that it was plain, (3) that it likely altered the outcome, and\n\n(4) that it was sufficiently fundamental to threaten the fairness\n\nor integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\"\n\nId. (citing United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 735-36 (1993)).\n\n            We agree that, as phrased, the portion of the instruction\n\ngiven had the potential to mislead the jury into thinking that an\n\n\"always\" per se rule existed.            Still, the error was not plain and\n\nthere are several reasons to think that the jury was not misled.\n\nParticular formulations in jury instructions are viewed in context,\n\nnot in isolation.         Here, the jury was instructed that it had to\n\n\"consider    all    the     facts      and   circumstances,\"   an     instruction\n\nconsistent with the fact-based approach to the existence of the\n\nattorney-client      relationship        and    inconsistent   with    a    per   se\n\napproach.    Further, there were numerous facts, apart from the\n\nexistence   of     the    power   of    attorney,   that   support    the   jury's\n\nconclusion that an attorney-client relationship existed.                     It is\n\nhighly unlikely that the error in the district court judge's\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\finstruction    changed       the   outcome    of     the   case.      Under   the\n\ncircumstances, the plain error test is not met.\n\nB.   The   Trial   Court's    Rejection      of    Defendants'     Proposed   Jury\n\nInstructions\n\n            Biddle also argues that the court erred by declining to\n\ngive appellant's proposed jury instructions.                Those instructions\n\nwould have further defined an attorney-client relationship in light\n\nof Sheinkopf v. Stone, 927 F.2d 1259 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n            Specifically, the defendants requested that the court\n\nadvise the jury that the representation must have been sought\n\ndirectly by Murray (Jury Instruction No. 2); that there are a\n\nnumber of factors that are important to determining whether an\n\nattorney/client relationship exists (No. 3); that the client's\n\nsubjective unspoken belief that an attorney was representing him is\n\ninsufficient to create an attorney-client relationship (No. 4);\n\nthat a client's belief must be objectively reasonable (No. 5); that\n\nthe attorney must be aware that the putative client was in fact\n\nrelying on the attorneys for legal counsel (No. 6); and that if a\n\nperson such as Murray were regularly obtaining legal assistance\n\nfrom others, then it is a reasonable assumption on the part of the\n\ndefendants that Murray was receiving legal assistance about his\n\nbusiness activities from other counsel and not from the defendants\n\n(No. 7).\n\n            A refusal to give a particular instruction constitutes\n\n\n                                      -21-\n\freversible error only if the requested instruction was (1) correct\n\nas a matter of substantive law, (2) not substantially incorporated\n\ninto the charge as rendered, and (3) integral to an important point\n\nin the case.      Elliott v. S.D. Warren Co., 134 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.\n\n1998).      The   district   court   should   refuse    a    request   for   an\n\ninstruction that states a legal holding which is not applicable to\n\nthe facts, even if it is otherwise correct.            See 9A C.A. Wright &\n\nA.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 2552 (2d ed. 2002).\n\nWe find no error.      The substance of many of the requests was in\n\nfact given and some had the potential to mislead.            For example, the\n\nsubstance of Requests Nos. 2 and 5 was given, Request No. 2 was\n\nmisleading, and Request No. 3 was given in the sense that the jury\n\nwas told to decide the issue on all of the facts.              Request No. 4\n\nwas misleading in that an attorney-client relationship may be\n\nimplied, and Request No. 6 was misleading in that it eliminated the\n\n\"should have known\" portion of the test.        Request No. 7 is closer,\n\nbut it was within the discretion of the trial judge to decide that\n\nunder Maine law one factor should not be emphasized over others.\n\n             As the district court noted, Sheinkopf's fact pattern is\n\ndissimilar from the one at issue in this case.              In Sheinkopf, the\n\nplaintiff sued an attorney's law firm after the joint venture in\n\nwhich both men had invested turned sour.           927 F.2d at 1260-61,\n\n1264-65.     The case did not involve a power of attorney.6            Biddle\n\n\n     6\n         Nor did it involve any of the situations that the district\n\n                                     -22-\n\fsought an instruction that more is required than an individual's\n\nsubjective belief that the person with whom he was dealing was his\n\nlawyer;   the   belief,   Biddle    contended,   must   be   objectively\n\nreasonable (No. 5).       This request derives from the portion of\n\nSheinkopf where the court explains that no reasonable person could\n\nhave objectively believed, on the facts of that case, that an\n\nattorney-client relationship was created.        The district court was\n\nwell within its discretion in finding that the facts of the present\n\ncase did not warrant that specific instruction, where it had\n\nalready instructed that the jury should consider all the facts and\n\ncircumstances and that the lawyers must have expressly or impliedly\n\nagreed to the representation.      Sheinkopf did not create a set of\n\none-size-fits-all jury instructions.\n\n          The verdict is affirmed.        Costs are awarded against\n\ndefendants.\n\n\n\n\ncourt in the present case described as giving rise to useful\nanalogies and parallels: a guardian-ward relationship; an agent-\nprinciple relationship; an employee-corporation relationship; or an\nexecutor- or trustee-beneficiary relationship. These are imperfect\nanalogies to be sure, but involve situations in which a client\nhires a lawyer to help the client meet his legal responsibility to\na third person.\n\n                                   -23-\n\f",

A federal jury in Maine found\n\nthat a lawyer and her law firm had simultaneously represented\n\nMurray Keatinge and another person with interests adverse to Murray\n\n(his son Kent) and then compounded the problem by suing Murray on\n\nbehalf of Kent.      For this breach of an attorney's duty of loyalty\n\nand care, the jury awarded damages of $660,000.                   The defense of\n\nattorney Elizabeth Biddle and the firm of Strout & Payson was that\n\nthey had never represented Murray Keatinge; rather, they had only\n\nrepresented Kent: they had represented Kent in the exercise of the\n\npower of attorney granted by Murray, in both the sale of Murray's\n\nhouse   and    the   management     of     Murray's     business.      Defendants\n\ncontended that an attorney's representation of the holder of a\n\npower   of     attorney      can   never       establish     an   attorney-client\n\nrelationship with the grantor of that power.\n\n              The Maine Law Court, in an answer to a question certified\n\nafter the jury rendered this verdict, disposed of that contention\n\nby holding that the issue of the existence of an attorney-client\n\nrelationship is one of fact.

Murray Keatinge and Elisabeth\n\nKeatinge married and had a son, Kent.          During the marriage they\n\nacquired a house, Greyrocks, in Camden, Maine in 1985.            Two days\n\nbefore she died in 1990, Elisabeth made a will, naming her husband\n\nexecutor,    and   created   the   Keatinge   Revocable   Trust   with   her\n\nhusband.    On her death, her half interest in Greyrocks poured into\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fthe   Revocable   Trust.      In   turn,      in   1996,   Murray    transferred\n\nElisabeth's interest in Greyrocks to a Marital Trust of which he\n\nwas Trustee.      The Marital Trust, of which Murray was the sole\n\nbeneficiary, was set up under the Revocable Trust.                There was also\n\nanother trust under the Revocable Trust: the Family Trust, whose\n\nsole beneficiary was Kent. Under the terms of the Revocable Trust,\n\nMurray, as Trustee, was obligated to fund the Family Trust in the\n\namount of $600,000 within six months of the death of the first of\n\nthe grantors of the Revocable Trust (i.e., Elisabeth).                He did not\n\ndo so.\n\n              It is undisputed that Murray owned at least half of\n\nGreyrocks.      In any event, Greyrocks was held by Murray both\n\nindividually and as Trustee of the Revocable Trust (Marital Trust).\n\nThe jury could have concluded that Murray was the sole owner of\n\nGreyrocks.\n\n             Murray   also   had   a   business,     the   Norumbega       Bed   and\n\nBreakfast (B&B).      As of at least early 1998, half of the record\n\ntitle was held by Murray personally and half was held by the\n\nRevocable Trust (Marital Trust).1            Before late 1997, Kent had been\n\ninvolved in the management of the B&B.\n\n             In August 1997, Biddle brought an action in the Maine\n\nProbate   Court   seeking    to    put   Murray     and    his   assets    into    a\n\n\n\n      1\n      Biddle later took the position                that   Kent     also   had    an\nownership interest in the B&B.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fguardianship and conservatorship.         Biddle had been retained to do\n\nso by Kent, who said he was concerned about the oversight of his\n\nfather's health care and businesses after his father had multiple\n\nby-pass   surgery.    Kent   was    appointed   temporary    guardian   and\n\nconservator September 3, 1997.         During that proceeding, Biddle\n\nnecessarily familiarized herself with Murray's assets. The purpose\n\nof the conservatorship was to protect the estate and assets of the\n\nallegedly incapacitated person, here Murray, as well as to protect\n\nKent's interest in his mother's estate, administered by Murray.\n\nMe. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 18-A, ยง 5-401 (2001). Murray, represented\n\nby different counsel, opposed Kent's petition for conservatorship\n\non September 12, 1997.       Murray said he opposed appointment of\n\neither a guardian or conservator and that even if there were an\n\nemergency, he had given Cecelia Cole a health care power of\n\nattorney and his businesses were run by competent managers.              He\n\nalso said that Kent had a conflict of interest which would render\n\nhim inappropriate to be guardian or conservator and that Kent's\n\ntemporary    appointment   should    be    terminated.      Indeed,   Kent,\n\nrepresented by Attorney Clark Byam (not at Strout & Payson), had\n\njust threatened to sue to remove Murray as a trustee of a family\n\ntrust.    In the fall of 1997, Kent had Biddle withdraw the petition\n\nafter a resolution was apparently worked out by agreement.               On\n\nNovember 29, 1997, apparently as part of the agreement, Murray\n\nappointed Kent to be a co-trustee of the Revocable Trust.             Biddle\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\falso       asked   that   her   firm's    fees    for   the   work   done   on   the\n\nconservatorship be paid out of Murray's estate.2\n\n               Pursuant to the resolution of the probate matter, Biddle\n\nprepared a power of attorney for Murray to execute, authorizing\n\nKent to exercise certain powers.                 This work apparently was also\n\npart of the fee application.             Murray executed the durable power of\n\nattorney on November 28, 1997.                   It gave Kent full power and\n\nauthority to conduct Murray's business and affairs. Included among\n\nthese was the power to borrow money, which Kent ultimately did\n\nemploy.       Kent's authority under the power of attorney went beyond\n\nthe powers he had previously held while helping to manage the B&B.\n\nThere are limits to a durable power of attorney.               The holder is not\n\nentitled to use the grantor's money or property for his own benefit\n\nor to make gifts to himself or others unless the power of attorney\n\nso specifies.       Id. ยง 5-508(b).       This power of attorney did not give\n\nKent such authority.\n\n               That power of attorney was replaced on March 10, 1998 by\n\na new durable power of attorney drafted by another lawyer.                  Though\n\nbroadly consistent with the old power of attorney, the new document\n\nprovided much more detail regarding the scope of Kent's authority.\n\nIt specifically empowered Kent to use his father's income and\n\nprincipal for Murray's support and to conduct Murray's estate\n\n\n\n       2\n     Biddle also asked for a reduction in the fees for counsel\nhired by Murray.\n\n                                          -6-\n\fplanning (in conformance with his father's wishes).     At the same\n\ntime, it specifically forbade Kent from making transfers to himself\n\nnot necessary for his health, education, support, or maintenance;\n\nreceiving compensation for services rendered under the power of\n\nattorney; or disregarding certain provisions of any living will or\n\nrelated document Murray executed.      Murray also executed a simple\n\nwill on March 10, 1998.\n\n          Kent called Murray's lawyer, James Elliott, who had\n\ndrafted the new durable power of attorney and will and asked him to\n\nsend both documents to Biddle.     On March 17, 1998, Elliott sent\n\nthem to Biddle with a cover letter saying that Murray wished only\n\nto have a simple will in effect while he gave thought to a more\n\nextensive estate plan.    Elliot also wrote that he assumed Biddle\n\nwould handle any further estate planning for Murray and that she\n\nshould advise him if that was not the case.     Biddle did not reply\n\nother than to acknowledge receipt. She did retain the originals of\n\nthe second durable power of attorney and the will in her files.\n\n          Using the first power of attorney, Kent retained Biddle\n\nto do work regarding the B&B and Greyrocks.      That work was done\n\nfrom November 1997 to September 1998.        In March 1998, Biddle\n\nanalyzed the financial situation of the B&B in order to secure a\n\nline of credit for it from the Gardner Savings Institution.      The\n\nequity line of credit was to be secured by a third mortgage on both\n\nthe B&B and Greyrocks.    Biddle worked on this project with James\n\n\n                                 -7-\n\fAyers, an accountant whom Kent had hired in his capacity as holder\n\nof the power of attorney, to do work for the B&B.                       It can be\n\ninferred that from the bank's point of view, Biddle's work on the\n\nB&B was being performed for Murray, and not for Kent in his own\n\ncapacity.      In    early   1998   Biddle     also   handled     two   employment\n\nquestions and a liquor license issue for the B&B.\n\n            On May 11, the issue of the $600,000 meant to be put into\n\nthe Family Trust for Kent's benefit was apparently addressed when\n\nBiddle proposed, by letter to Murray's lawyer, that the Revocable\n\nTrust execute a note and mortgage to the Family Trust for $600,000\n\nsecured by a mortgage on Greyrocks and the B&B.                   The letter said\n\nshe was acting for Kent Keatinge and asked that Murray execute the\n\nnote, mortgage,       and    an   affidavit    that   he    was   represented   by\n\nseparate counsel.           Murray did so and his lawyer returned the\n\ndocuments on June 1, 1998.          Murray's lawyer had earlier expressed\n\nto Biddle his concerns about the facts that Kent had been appointed\n\nco-trustee while the conservatorship for Murray was pending and\n\nthat Biddle had unofficially raised doubts about the Marital Trust.\n\n            In July 1998 Biddle restructured the B&B to transfer its\n\nownership into a new subchapter S corporation, E.B. Hammond, which\n\nshe had incorporated.         Both Murray and Kent appear to have been\n\nshareholders    of    E.B.    Hammond.        It   also    appears   that   Biddle\n\nstructured matters so that Murray owned half of E.B. Hammond in one\n\nof his capacities and Kent, in some capacity, owned the other half.\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fOne of Murray's theories in the case was that this restructuring\n\nwas not necessary for the management of the B&B and was done in\n\norder to take away Murray's ownership interest.           It was Biddle's\n\nintent that Murray would transfer his ownership interest in the B&B\n\nto E.B. Hammond and that E.B. Hammond would own the B&B.\n\n          Indeed,    in    an   August    13,   1998   memorandum,   Biddle\n\nconcluded that all of Elisabeth Keatinge's estate should have gone\n\nto the Family Trust and none to the Marital Trust.               She also\n\nconcluded that the transfer of Elisabeth's half interest to the\n\nMarital Trust was invalid.          These conclusions were obviously\n\ncontrary to Murray's interests.          Based on these conclusions, she\n\nnamed Murray and the three trusts as the grantors of Greyrocks in\n\nthe Warranty Deed.        She did not call to Murray's attention the\n\nissue on which there was conflict.\n\n          The bulk of plaintiff's complaint dealt with Biddle's\n\nhandling of the sale of Greyrocks.          Greyrocks and Norumbega were\n\ncross-collateralized through Gardner Savings Institution.3           Biddle\n\nhad represented to the Bank that Murray would invest $110,000 of\n\nthe proceeds from Greyrocks in the B&B.         Biddle also told the Bank\n\nthat \"Murray and Kent\" are entitled to these proceeds from the sale\n\nof Greyrocks in equal shares, but did not copy Murray on the\n\nletter.   A jury could find that Murray had not authorized that\n\n\n\n     3\n     Biddle did send a letter to the Bank saying she was\nappearing only on behalf of Kent Keatinge.\n\n                                   -9-\n\frepresentation or the transfer of the $110,000 from the Greyrocks\n\nproceeds.    Biddle also represented to the Bank that Murray needed\n\nsome of the proceeds to pay for his retirement and capital gains\n\ntaxes.\n\n            There is no dispute that Murray owned at least half of\n\nGreyrocks outright at the time of the sale.          Indeed, at the\n\nSeptember 1, 1998 closing, Biddle signed in the space for the\n\nseller's signature as follows: \"Elizabeth Biddle, attorney-in-fact\n\nfor Murray Keatinge.\" She communicated with Murray both before and\n\nafter the sale.     Before the sale she sent him documents for him to\n\nsign and return to her.    He did so.   After the sale, Biddle spoke\n\nwith Murray about the bill -- he questioned her over the telephone\n\nabout the closing statement and its legal fees and the accounting\n\nstatement.     Murray asked for an itemized statement; Biddle never\n\nsent one.     This was the only direct contact between Biddle and\n\nMurray.\n\n             There was reason for Murray to be concerned about the\n\nbill.     Biddle had taken $14,680 from the closing proceeds for her\n\nlegal fees.      But no more than $6,800 of the legal fees were\n\nattributable to the closing.     The discrepancy is not explained by\n\nwork done for the B&B; that was billed separately.      The bill did\n\ninclude fees for work directly against Murray's interests:      that\n\nis, work for legal research on whether Murray had adequately funded\n\n\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fa trust established for Kent's benefit, work going back to March\n\n1998.\n\n          The conflict of interests between Kent and Murray was\n\nmade explicit by Biddle in a September 29, 1998 letter to Murray,\n\nafter the closing.   The letter said that Biddle had represented\n\nKent since the guardianship proceedings the prior summer and that\n\nthrough this work and the sale of Greyrocks Biddle had become\n\nfamiliar with Murray and Elisabeth's estate planning.     Murray,\n\nBiddle wrote, had deprived Kent of the benefits he should have\n\nreceived and Kent wanted to resolve the outstanding financial\n\nissues between the two of them.\n\n          Biddle, representing Kent, sued Murray in October 1998\n\nin Superior Court in Maine on claims that Murray had failed as\n\ntrustee to adequately fund a trust established for Kent's benefit.\n\nBiddle used information against Murray which she had obtained in\n\nthe course of the prior representation.\n\n          That lawsuit was settled.   As part of the settlement,\n\nMurray gave up his ownership in E.B. Hammond, which owned the B&B;\n\nsome of Murray's other property was transferred to Kent; Murray\n\nassumed any tax liability from the sale of Greyrocks; and Murray\n\nand Kent executed a mutual release.   The lawsuit was apparently,\n\nfor Murray, the last straw which led to the federal litigation.\n\nThe costs of that settlement and the attorneys fees paid to defend\n\n\n\n\n                              -11-\n\fhimself became a major component of Murray's damages claim in the\n\nfederal litigation.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            Murray brought the federal litigation on October 19,\n\n1999, under the court's diversity jurisdiction. Discovery was\n\ncompleted, including Murray's deposition, when Murray died on\n\nAugust 1, 2000.     His estate subsequently became the plaintiff.\n\n            The   complaint    based    its   legal   malpractice   claim   on\n\nallegations that Biddle did not disclose to Murray her conflict of\n\ninterest;     diverted   for   nefarious      reasons   proceeds    from    the\n\nGreyrocks closing; and failed adequately to represent Murray's\n\ninterests.4    Ultimately, the jury would be instructed that if an\n\n\n     4\n      Specifically, plaintiff made the following allegations: (1)\nthat Biddle failed to disclose to Murray that she should not\nrepresent his interests during the sale of Greyrocks since she was\nsimultaneously advising Kent as to claims he might have against\nMurray for Murray's performance of his duties as a trustee under\nthe Revocable Trust; (2) that without Murray's consent Biddle\nprepared a proposed deed and real estate tax transfer declaration\nwhich included as grantors entities which had no ownership interest\nin Greyrocks; (3) that Biddle escrowed $329,969.17 with the Gardner\nSavings Institution without authority from Murray, and provided for\nthe account to be equally divided between Murray Keatinge and the\nKeatinge Family Trust (of which Kent was a beneficiary); (4) that\nBiddle permitted some of the escrow amounts to be paid to people\nother than Murray; (5) that this diversion of the proceeds from\nGreyrock was done for nefarious reasons -- diverting monies to\nKent, depriving Murray of sums he would need to defend himself\nagainst the lawsuit that Kent was about to bring, and increasing\ntheir own legal fees in that litigation; (6) that Biddle\nmisdirected some $10,000 of the closing proceeds to pay for work\ndone by accountants that was unrelated to the Greyrocks sale and\nthat was for Kent's benefit, adverse to Murray's interests; (7)\nthat Murray had never agreed to invest $110,000 from Greyrocks in\nthe B&B and he could not recover that sum; and (8) that Biddle\n\n                                       -12-\n\fattorney-client relationship existed between Murray and Biddle,\n\nthen there was a breach of Biddle's duties to Murray.   There is no\n\nquestion that there was a breach of the duty of loyalty and\n\ndue care if an attorney-client relationship existed between\n\nMurray and Biddle.    There is also no claim about damages in\n\nthis appeal.\n\n          The trial took four days.    After deliberations, the jury\n\nreturned a verdict finding that the defendants were in breach of\n\ntheir duties to Murray and that the breach had caused Murray\n\n$660,000 in total damages.   The jury also found that Murray had not\n\nnegligently caused his damages.\n\n          After the verdict, on a motion by defendants, the federal\n\ndistrict court certified questions to the Maine Law Court.5     The\n\n\nfailed to adequately represent Murray against Kent's contrary\ninterests.\n     5\n      The judge certified the following three questions to the\nMaine Law Court:\n               A. When the holder of a power of attorney hires a\n          lawyer concerning matters within the scope of the power,\n          can the engagement ever result in an attorney-client\n          relationship between the hired lawyer and the grantor of\n          the power?\n               B.    If yes, is there any change in the proof\n          necessary to demonstrate the existence of such an\n          attorney-client relationship? Specifically, in Board of\n          Overseers of the Bar v. Mangan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">763</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1189</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Me. 2001),\n          the Law Court adopted the formulation\n              that an attorney-client relationship is created when\n              (1) a person seeks advice or assistance from an\n              attorney, (2) the advice or assistance sought\n              pertains   to    matters   within    the   attorney's\n              professional competence, and (3) the attorney\n\n                                -13-\n\fLaw Court replied:\n\n          In ordinary circumstances, when the holder of a power of\n          attorney retains counsel to assist him in fulfilling his\n          duties, the lawyer has an attorney-client relationship\n          with the holder only. In order to effectively exercise\n          the powers granted to him, the holder of a power of\n          attorney may often need to retain counsel. For example,\n          the holder of a power of attorney is not authorized to\n          appear pro se on behalf of the grantor.\n\n          Thus, the mere retention of counsel by the holder does\n          not by itself create an attorney-client relationship\n          between the attorney and the grantor. There must be some\n          other agreement or arrangement to create the separate\n          attorney-client relationship between the attorney and the\n          grantor.   To hold otherwise would leave the attorney\n          hired to represent the holder of a power of attorney in\n          the untenable position of being subject to ill-defined\n          professional responsibilities and create the reality of\n          conflicting loyalties.\n\nEstate of Keatinge, 789 A.2d at 1275 (internal citations omitted).\n\n          The district court then rejected the motion for a new\n\ntrial and for judgment as a matter of law, holding:\n\n\n              expressly or impliedly agrees to give or actually\n              gives the desired advice or assistance.\n          Id. at 1192-93 (citations and quotation marks omitted).\n          When the holder of the power engages the lawyer, is it\n          appropriate to modify the first of the three requirements\n          so as not to require the grantor personally to seek the\n          advice or assistance, but rather to require that the\n          lawyer be asked for advice or assistance \"on behalf of\n          the grantor\"?\n               C.

The court instructed:\n\n           On the question whether Murray Keatinge had an\n           attorney/client relationship with the lawyers, the\n           plaintiff Cecelia Cole bears the burden of proof. To\n           proceed, she must show each of the following three things\n           by a preponderance of the evidence:\n\n                  (a) That the lawyers were asked for advice or\n                  assistance on behalf of Murray Keatinge;\n\n                  (b)   That the advice or assistance related to\n                  legal matters;\n\n                  (c)   That the lawyers expressly or impliedly\n                  agreed to give the desired advice or assistance\n                  on behalf of Murray Keatinge, or failed to\n                  demonstrate that they did not agree when they\n                  knew or reasonably should have known that Murray\n                  Keatinge reasonably relied on them to provide the\n                  services. That is, Cecelia Cole must show that\n                  Elizabeth Biddle and/or Strout & Payson knew or\n                  should have known that Murray Keatinge was\n                  relying upon them for legal counsel.\n\n           You should consider all the facts and circumstances.

Mangan, </pre><span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">763</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1189</span></span><pre class=\"inline\"> (Me. 2001).\n\n           Though neither party contested the relevance of the\n\nMangan   standard,    both   parties     objected   to   the   court's    jury\n\ninstructions.    The plaintiff objected that the court should have\n\ndelivered proposed jury instructions providing, first, that an\n\nattorney retained by a guardian or conservator owes a fiduciary\n\nduty to the ward as well as to the guardian and, second, that\n\ncounsel to the holder of a power of attorney represents and owes a\n\nduty of care to the grantor of the power of attorney (as well as to\n\nthe   holder).       The   defendants    objected   that   the    court      had\n\neffectively instructed the jury that the holder's counsel always\n\nhas a relationship with the grantor -- when, in fact, it should\n\nhave instructed      the   jury   that   holder's   counsel    never   has    an\n\nattorney-client relationship with the grantor.\n\nA.    The \"On Behalf Of\" Instruction\n\n           The defendants argue that the jury instruction as given:\n\n(1) permitted the jury to find that an attorney asked to provide\n\nrepresentation to a holder of a power of attorney would, by that\n\nfact, create an attorney-client relationship, because by definition\n\nthe holder is usually acting for the benefit of the grantor of the\n\npower of attorney; and (2) did not tell the jury that mere\n\nretention of counsel by the holder does not by itself create an\n\nattorney-client relationship with the grantor.             This, they say,\n\n\n                                    -16-\n\fcontravenes the Law Court's holding that the mere retention of\n\ncounsel by the holder does not by itself create an attorney-client\n\nrelationship.    Estate of Keatinge, 789 A.2d at 1275-76.   We agree\n\nthat the instruction given had some potential to be misleading on\n\ncertain facts.\n\n          Nonetheless, Biddle's attorney failed to preserve his\n\nobjection to the trial judge's jury instructions.     \"The governing\n\nrule provides that a party cannot assign as error the giving of or\n\nfailure to give an instruction 'unless that party objects thereto\n\nbefore the jury retires to consider its verdict, stating distinctly\n\nthe matter objected to and the grounds of the objection.'

It is this latter part of the\n\ndistinctness requirement (the proffering of a satisfactory cure)\n\nwhich defendants do not meet.\n\n            After the judge finished instructing the jury, Biddle's\n\nattorney objected to the formulation of the first prong of the\n\nstandard for determining whether an attorney-client relationship\n\nexists.    \"By   leaving      that    prong    as   phrased,        the   court    has\n\neffectively held and instructed the jury that representation [by an\n\nattorney] of a representative [i.e., the holder of the power of\n\nattorney] is representation of the protected party [i.e., the\n\ngrantor]. Because necessarily, the representative [or holder] is\n\nacting on behalf of the protected party [or grantor].\"                    But Biddle\n\ndid not ask that the court instruct that there was no rule that an\n\nattorney   retained     by    the    holder    of   a    power     of   attorney   was\n\nautomatically in an attorney-client relationship with the grantor\n\n\n                                       -18-\n\fof a power of attorney.    Rather, Biddle's position throughout was\n\nthat an attorney-client relationship can never arise under these\n\ncircumstances. Biddle's argument was that under Mangan, Murray had\n\nto directly ask Biddle for the service.   And that argument is quite\n\nwrong; further, it did not distinctly notify the court of the\n\nargument Biddle now makes.     She then compounded the problem by\n\ninsisting that an instruction be given that when a representative\n\nretains a lawyer, the client is the representative, and not the\n\nparty for whom the representative is working.\n\n          Our view that defendants did not distinctly state the\n\nview they now advance is reinforced by the trial judge's reaction.\n\nThe trial judge rejected defendants' objection, observing:\n\n          [T]he defendant takes the . . . extreme . . . position\n          that the client holder of the power is automatically the\n          client only, and it cannot be the grantor.      I think\n          that's also an incorrect statement of the law. And so\n          I'm rejecting those particular objections.\n\n                 . . . .\n\n                 . . . Essentially, what the plaintiff has\n          maintained here is that the grantor of a power of\n          attorney is automatically the client of anybody the\n          holder of the power consults at least in matters covered\n          by the power.\n\n                 And the defendant essentially contends that the\n          grantor is never the client in such circumstances.\n          Clearly   my  charge  has   rejected  both   of  these\n          alternatives.\n\n          The Maine Law Court's response to certified question one,\n\nsee Estate of Keatinge, 789 A.2d at 1275-76, confirms that the\n\ndistrict court judge correctly rejected this extreme position.\n\n                                -19-\n\fDefendants proposed a \"cure\" which was substantively wrong and in\n\ndoing so did not give the trial judge fair notice of the real\n\nproblem.\n\n            In the absence of a properly preserved objection, this\n\ncourt reviews the trial judge's jury instructions under the plain\n\nerror standard.          Genlyte, 289 F.3d at 134.         The party claiming\n\nplain error is required to demonstrate \"(1) that there was error,\n\n(2) that it was plain, (3) that it likely altered the outcome, and\n\n(4) that it was sufficiently fundamental to threaten the fairness\n\nor integrity or public reputation of the judicial proceedings.\"\n\nId.

Still, the error was not plain and\n\nthere are several reasons to think that the jury was not misled.\n\nParticular formulations in jury instructions are viewed in context,\n\nnot in isolation.         Here, the jury was instructed that it had to\n\n\"consider    all    the     facts      and   circumstances,\"   an     instruction\n\nconsistent with the fact-based approach to the existence of the\n\nattorney-client      relationship        and    inconsistent   with    a    per   se\n\napproach.    Further, there were numerous facts, apart from the\n\nexistence   of     the    power   of    attorney,   that   support    the   jury's\n\nconclusion that an attorney-client relationship existed.                     It is\n\nhighly unlikely that the error in the district court judge's\n\n\n                                         -20-\n\finstruction    changed       the   outcome    of     the   case.

The   Trial   Court's    Rejection      of    Defendants'     Proposed   Jury\n\nInstructions\n\n            Biddle also argues that the court erred by declining to\n\ngive appellant's proposed jury instructions.

The   district   court   should   refuse    a    request   for   an\n\ninstruction that states a legal holding which is not applicable to\n\nthe facts, even if it is otherwise correct.            See 9A C.A. Wright &\n\nA.R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure ยง 2552 (2d ed. 2002).\n\nWe find no error.      The substance of many of the requests was in\n\nfact given and some had the potential to mislead.            For example, the\n\nsubstance of Requests Nos. 2 and 5 was given, Request No. 2 was\n\nmisleading, and Request No. 3 was given in the sense that the jury\n\nwas told to decide the issue on all of the facts.              Request No. 4\n\nwas misleading in that an attorney-client relationship may be\n\nimplied, and Request No. 6 was misleading in that it eliminated the\n\n\"should have known\" portion of the test.        Request No. 7 is closer,\n\nbut it was within the discretion of the trial judge to decide that\n\nunder Maine law one factor should not be emphasized over others.\n\n             As the district court noted, Sheinkopf's fact pattern is\n\ndissimilar from the one at issue in this case.              In Sheinkopf, the\n\nplaintiff sued an attorney's law firm after the joint venture in\n\nwhich both men had invested turned sour.           927 F.2d at 1260-61,\n\n1264-65.     The case did not involve a power of attorney.6            Biddle\n\n\n     6\n         Nor did it involve any of the situations that the district\n\n                                     -22-\n\fsought an instruction that more is required than an individual's\n\nsubjective belief that the person with whom he was dealing was his\n\nlawyer;   the   belief,   Biddle    contended,   must   be   objectively\n\nreasonable (No. 5).       This request derives from the portion of\n\nSheinkopf where the court explains that no reasonable person could\n\nhave objectively believed, on the facts of that case, that an\n\nattorney-client relationship was created.        The district court was\n\nwell within its discretion in finding that the facts of the present\n\ncase did not warrant that specific instruction, where it had\n\nalready instructed that the jury should consider all the facts and\n\ncircumstances and that the lawyers must have expressly or impliedly\n\nagreed to the representation.      Sheinkopf did not create a set of\n\none-size-fits-all jury instructions.\n\n          The verdict is affirmed.        Costs are awarded against\n\ndefendants.\n\n\n\n\ncourt in the present case described as giving rise to useful\nanalogies and parallels: a guardian-ward relationship; an agent-\nprinciple relationship; an employee-corporation relationship; or an\nexecutor- or trustee-beneficiary relationship. These are imperfect\nanalogies to be sure, but involve situations in which a client\nhires a lawyer to help the client meet his legal responsibility to\na third person.\n\n                                   -23-\n\f</pre>",
