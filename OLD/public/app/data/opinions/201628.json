WILKERSON,\n\n                         Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n             APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                   FOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS\n\n               [Hon. Mark L. Wolf, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                       Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                 John R. Gibson,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                       and Lynch, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Miriam Conrad for appellant.\n\n     Jonathan L. Marcus, United States Department of Justice, with\nwhom Michael J. Sullivan, United States Attorney, District of\nMassachusetts, and John T. McNeil, Assistant United States\nAttorney, District of Massachusetts, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             June 9, 2005\n\n\n\n\n     *\n         Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            JOHN    R.   GIBSON,   Senior   Circuit   Judge.       Austin   R.\n\nWilkerson appeals his conviction for possessing a firearm as a\n\nconvicted felon under 18 U.S.C. ยง 922(g)(1), possessing more than\n\nfive grams of cocaine base with intent to distribute under 21\n\nU.S.C. ยง 841(a)(1), and carrying a firearm in connection with a\n\ndrug trafficking offense under 18 U.S.C. ยง 924(c)(1).              Wilkerson\n\nasserts that the district court erred by admitting prior consistent\n\nstatements of a government witness in violation of Fed. R. Evid.\n\n106   and   the    common   law,   permitting   a   government    witness   to\n\ninterpret one of his post-arrest statements in violation of Fed. R.\n\nEvid. 701, and allowing the prosecutor to improperly vouch for his\n\nwitnesses in summation and engage in other forms of prosecutorial\n\nmisconduct.        Wilkerson also challenges the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence to establish a nexus between the firearm and interstate\n\ncommerce, and he argues that his sentence should be remanded\n\npursuant to United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).                 We\n\nhold that the district court erred in the admission of prior\n\nconsistent statements, but this error was harmless.              We remand to\n\nthe district court for resentencing, and we affirm the district\n\ncourt on all other issues.\n\n            Boston police officers Tom Joyce and Ed Fleming stopped\n\nWilkerson after he made an illegal U-turn.            During the stop, the\n\nofficers learned he was driving with a suspended license.             Officer\n\nJoyce asked Wilkerson to step out of the vehicle, but Wilkerson\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\frefused.    Joyce and Wilkerson struggled for the door while Officer\n\nFleming called for back-up.       Wilkerson then drove off and a chase\n\nensued.\n\n            The car chase ended when Wilkerson abandoned his vehicle\n\nand took off on foot.      From about thirty to forty feet away, the\n\nofficers saw Wilkerson holding his right side around his waist\n\narea.     Joyce informed his partner, \"Eddie, be careful, I think he\n\nhas a gun.\"     Joyce then broadcast over the radio, \"He's reaching\n\nfor his     budge,\"   meaning   that    Wilkerson   was   reaching   for   the\n\nwaistband area where he thought Wilkerson had a gun.           The officers\n\nreported that Wilkerson continued to hold his right waist area\n\nwhile they followed him, but they did not actually see a gun.\n\n             The officers pursued Wilkerson onto Hartwell Street.\n\nOfficer Joyce testified at trial that he was about sixty feet away\n\nwhen he saw Wilkerson turn into an alley between houses at 11 and\n\n5 Hartwell on the north side of the street.                Officer Fleming\n\ntestified that he had just turned onto Hartwell when he saw the\n\nsame thing.    As Wilkerson turned into the alley, Joyce slowed down\n\nand peered down the driveway on the south side of 11 Hartwell,\n\nbetween 11 and 15/17 Hartwell, to see if Wilkerson would come back\n\nthe opposite way.      He did not.      When Joyce reached the alley, he\n\nsaw Wilkerson climbing over a six- or seven-foot-high fence, no\n\nlonger clutching his waist area.             Joyce did not see anything in\n\nWilkerson's hands or belt as he lowered himself over the fence.\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\fJoyce did not attempt to scale the fence, but instead turned around\n\nand ran up the driveway.      There Joyce saw Wilkerson running west\n\nthrough the backyards toward Cheney Street.        Officers from another\n\npolice unit arrested Wilkerson when they caught him running at a\n\nslow jog on Maple Street near Cheney.\n\n            After   Wilkerson's    arrest,    officers   were    ordered    to\n\nretrace the route of the foot chase looking for anything he might\n\nhave discarded.     Another officer accompanied by Joyce found a gun\n\nand 12.55 grams of crack cocaine in the alley between 11 and 5\n\nHartwell.    The items were described as clean and dry and lying on\n\ntop of damp, dirty refuse.        The gun was cocked, loaded, and ready\n\nto be fired.        The key factual dispute at trial was whether\n\nWilkerson ran up the alley where the gun and drugs were found,\n\nbetween 5 and 11 Hartwell, or whether he ran up the driveway\n\nbetween 11 and 15/17 Hartwell, which he would have had to pass\n\nbefore reaching the alley.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            Both of the evidentiary issues Wilkerson raises on appeal\n\ninvolve testimony about his flight path on Hartwell Street.                 We\n\nfirst address Federal Rule of Evidence 106 and the common law to\n\ndetermine    when   prior   consistent    statements     may    be   used   to\n\nrehabilitate a witness's credibility.\n\n            Officer Fleming testified that he saw Wilkerson turn into\n\nthe alley between 5 and 11 Hartwell.         Defense counsel attempted to\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fimpeach   Fleming's    credibility    on   this   subject     by    eliciting\n\ntestimony that (1) he did not describe the alley in the radio\n\nbroadcasts he made while chasing Wilkerson, (2) he referred to the\n\nalley as a driveway in his police report, and (3) in state grand\n\njury testimony he stated that Wilkerson ran between the second and\n\nthird houses on Hartwell, which would be between 15/17 and 11 if\n\ncounting from the direction in which they ran.                   Fleming was\n\nimpeached on other subjects with his federal grand jury testimony,\n\nbut none concerned Wilkerson's flight path.\n\n           To rehabilitate his credibility, the government asked\n\nOfficer Fleming on redirect examination, \"[A]t any time prior to\n\nwriting the report or in testifying in this case, did you ever\n\nindicate that [Wilkerson] ran up anyplace other than that area\n\nbetween 5 and 11 Hartwell?\"      He answered no.         He was then asked,\n\n\"[A]t any prior time, writing a report or in your prior testimony,\n\ndid you indicate that the defendant ran up any location other than\n\nthis location between 5 and 11 Hartwell?\"             Again he answered no.\n\nFinally   he   was   asked,   referring    to   his    federal     grand   jury\n\ntestimony, \"[D]o you recall what you said in that testimony?\"\n\nFleming answered:\n\n     A.    I testified to the fact that I saw the defendant\n           run on to Hartwell Street and run up an alleyway\n           between two homes on Hartwell Street.\n\n     Q.    And were you shown two photographs in the grand\n           jury?\n\n     A.    I was.\n\n                                     -5-\n\f      Q.     And what did you identify those photographs as\n             being?\n\n      A.     As the alleyway the defendant ran.\n\n             Defense counsel objected to this line of questioning.\n\nShe argued that the testimony was hearsay and should not be allowed\n\nas non-hearsay prior consistent statements under Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 801(d)(1)(B) because it was not offered to rebut a charge\n\nof recent fabrication.        The district court agreed and ruled that\n\nFleming's testimony could not be admitted under Rule 801. Instead,\n\nthe court allowed the testimony under Rule 1061, the rule of\n\ncompleteness.       Defense counsel maintained her objection.           The\n\ndistrict court, sua sponte, gave a limiting instruction directing\n\nthe   jury   to    consider   the   testimony   only   for   the   officer's\n\ncredibility and not for the truth of the statements.\n\n             We review the district court's ruling for abuse of\n\ndiscretion.       See United States v. Millan, 230 F.3d 431, 434 (1st\n\nCir. 2000). We conclude that the district court erred in admitting\n\nthe testimony, but the error is harmless.\n\n             In United States v. Simonelli, 237 F.3d 19, 25-29 (1st\n\nCir. 2001), this court addressed the same issues presented here.\n\nOn cross-examination, a witness's prior inconsistent statements\n\n\n\n      1\n         \"When a writing or recorded statement or part thereof is\nintroduced by a party, an adverse party may require the\nintroduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or\nrecorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered\ncontemporaneously with it.\" Fed. R. Evid. 106.\n\n                                     -6-\n\fwere used to impeach his credibility.           On redirect the government\n\nasked the witness about statements he made to the grand jury which\n\nwere consistent with his trial testimony.              Some of the questions\n\nwent beyond the specific points covered on cross-examination, but\n\nall were within its general scope.            Many of the statements were\n\nused only to rehabilitate the witness, rather than as substantive\n\nevidence.     See id. at 26.\n\n             In   Simonelli    we   stated    that   when   prior     consistent\n\nstatements are admitted to rehabilitate a witness, admissibility is\n\n\"determined by the interplay between the rule of completeness and\n\nthe common law doctrine about prior consistent statements.\" Id. at\n\n27.    We noted that both the rule of completeness and the common law\n\ndoctrine allow prior consistent statements when they tend to show\n\nthat    a   statement   used   to   impeach    a     witness    is    not   really\n\ninconsistent when understood in its proper context. See id. at 27-\n\n28.\n\n             The government argues that Officer Fleming's testimony\n\nwas    properly   admitted     because   it    was    offered    to    rebut   the\n\nimpression created by defense counsel's cross-examination that\n\nOfficer Fleming had given conflicting or uncertain accounts of\n\nWilkerson's flight path. However, Simonelli makes clear that prior\n\nconsistent statements must at least have \"some rebutting force\n\nbeyond the mere fact that the witness has repeated on a prior\n\noccasion a statement consistent with his trial testimony.\" See id.\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fat 27 (quoting United States v. Pierre, 781 F.2d 329, 331 (2d Cir.\n\n1986)). The redirect testimony at issue does not meet the required\n\nstandard.    Defense counsel cross-examined Officer Fleming about\n\ninconsistencies in the way he described Wilkerson's flight path and\n\nhis failure to broadcast information about the alley over the\n\npolice radio.     Confirming on redirect that the officer had never\n\ndescribed a different flight path did not clarify or otherwise\n\nprovide   context   for    the   statements   used   to   impeach   Fleming.\n\nRather, the testimony only bolstered Officer Fleming's credibility\n\ngenerally by restating what had already been said.            That kind of\n\nrehabilitation is impermissible.          See Simonelli, 237 F.3d at 28\n\n(\"There is no rule admitting all prior consistent statements simply\n\nto bolster the credibility of a witness who has been impeached by\n\nparticulars.\").\n\n            The government argues that any error in admitting the\n\ntestimony is harmless.      \"A non-constitutional evidentiary error is\n\nharmless . . . so long as it is highly probable that the error did\n\nnot influence the verdict.\"       United States v. Piper, 298 F.3d 47,\n\n56 (1st Cir. 2002).       Several factors lead us to conclude that the\n\nerror is harmless.\n\n            The government's case against Wilkerson was strong even\n\nwithout Officer Fleming's redirect testimony. Wilkerson drove away\n\nfrom the officers, prompting a car chase; Wilkerson abandoned his\n\nvehicle and ran from the officers on foot; both officers saw\n\n\n                                    -8-\n\fWilkerson holding his waist area and believed he had a gun; Officer\n\nJoyce warned other officers over the police radio that Wilkerson\n\nwas reaching for his \"budge,\" a term that conveyed Joyce's belief\n\nthat Wilkerson     had   a   gun;   Joyce,   who   followed    closer   behind\n\nWilkerson during the chase and was the government's key witness,\n\nalso testified that he saw Wilkerson run up the alley where the gun\n\nand drugs were found; the gun and drugs were clean and dry in an\n\notherwise damp and dirty alley, indicating that they had not been\n\nthere very long; and shortly after running from the alley where the\n\ngun and drugs were found, Wilkerson gave up the chase.                     The\n\nexculpatory evidence Wilkerson presented at trial was minimal and\n\nunpersuasive.\n\n             Moreover, Officer Fleming's redirect testimony was not\n\nunique and was used only to rehabilitate his credibility.                  \"By\n\ndefinition, prior consistent statements do not consist of new\n\nsubstantive information.        Their impact comes from corroborating\n\nother, perhaps less compelling, evidence.\"          United States v. Awon,\n\n135   F.3d   96,   101   (1st   Cir.   1998).      At   most   the   testimony\n\nstrengthened Officer Fleming's previous testimony by corroborating\n\nhis story.    While this may warrant a new trial in some cases, it is\n\nhighly probable that the corroborating testimony did not influence\n\nthe verdict in this case.        We conclude that the district court's\n\nerror is harmless.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -9-\n\f                                     II.\n\n            The second evidentiary issue Wilkerson raises is whether\n\nthe district      court   violated   Federal   Rule   of   Evidence   701   by\n\nallowing a government witness to interpret one of Wilkerson's post-\n\narrest statements.        The decision to admit lay opinion testimony\n\npursuant to Rule 701 is reviewed for abuse of discretion.              United\n\nStates v. Tom, 330 F.3d 83, 94 (1st Cir. 2003).            We conclude that\n\nthe district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\n\ntestimony.\n\n            Wilkerson described his route during the foot chase in an\n\ninterview after his arrest with Boston Police Detective Jeremiah\n\nBenton.     Detective Benton testified that Wilkerson told him that\n\n\"he grabbed the tall fence to get up on the small fence.\"                Over\n\ndefendant's objection, Benton testified that he understood the\n\ndefendant \"to mean that he grabbed on to a higher fence to pull\n\nhimself up on to a lower fence to get over the higher fence.\"\n\nDetective Benton then illustrated this testimony by pointing to\n\nparts of a fence in a photograph of the alley between 11 and 5\n\nHartwell.      In its closing argument, the government asserted that\n\nWilkerson's post-arrest statement referred to the fence in the back\n\nof the alley in which Officers Joyce and Fleming saw the defendant\n\nrun.\n\n             The government argues that this testimony is admissible\n\nunder   Rule    701,   which   permits   the   admission   of   lay   opinion\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\ftestimony only when it is:\n\n     (a) rationally based on the perception of the witness,\n     (b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness'\n     testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and\n     (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other\n     specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.\n\nFed. R. Evid. 701.        Wilkerson argues that the testimony did not\n\nmeet the requirements of (a) or (b).\n\n            The   first      element   of     Rule    701    is        \"the    familiar\n\nrequirement of first-hand knowledge or observation.\" Fed. R. Evid.\n\n701 advisory committee's note.              This court has noted that the\n\nrequirement is met when the testimony is based on the personal\n\nperception of the witness and does not require any irrational leaps\n\nof logic for the witness to render the opinion.                   See Lynch v. City\n\nof Boston, 180 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir. 1999).              Wilkerson argues that\n\nthis test is not met because Detective Benton lacked any special\n\nunderstanding     of   what   Wilkerson       meant   and    he    had    no   special\n\nfamiliarity   with     the    area.     This     argument         is    unpersuasive.\n\nDetective Benton testified that he was familiar with the alley in\n\nwhich the gun and drugs were found and with the driveway that\n\ndefense counsel argued Wilkerson used to flee.                    He walked up the\n\nalley before interviewing Wilkerson, he viewed the driveway the\n\nsame night of Wilkerson's arrest, and he walked up the driveway the\n\nnext day.     He was thus in a position to assess which fence\n\nWilkerson referred to in his statement.                     Benton's opinion is\n\ntherefore rationally based on his perception.\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f            Wilkerson also argues that the \"helpfulness\" requirement\n\nis not met because the statement itself is clear and the jury had\n\nother evidence before it from which it could determine which area\n\nWilkerson was describing.           Wilkerson points to several cases\n\nholding that the interpretation of clear statements is not helpful\n\nto the jury.       See, e.g., United States v. Dicker, 853 F.2d 1103,\n\n1109 (3d Cir. 1988)(\"[T]he interpretation of clear statements is\n\nnot permissible, and is barred by the helpfulness requirement of .\n\n. . Fed. R. Evid. 701.\").              However, these cases involve the\n\ninterpretation      of   facially      clear     and    coherent    statements.\n\nWilkerson's statement that he \"grabbed the tall fence to get up on\n\nthe small fence\" is vague and confusing.               It is not at all clear\n\nfrom the photographs of the alley and the driveway what Wilkerson\n\nmeant. Detective Benton saw the area immediately after Wilkerson's\n\narrest.     He walked through the alley before taking Wilkerson's\n\nstatement    and    walked   through    the    driveway    the    next   morning.\n\nAlthough the jury viewed the area, it was before they heard any\n\ntestimony.    Under the circumstances, the district court could have\n\nreasonably    determined     that   Detective     Benton    was    in    a   unique\n\nposition to help the jury understand what Wilkerson might have\n\nmeant.    See Tom, 330 F.3d at 94.             Accordingly, we conclude the\n\ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the\n\ntestimony.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\f                               III.\n\n          Wilkerson also contends that the prosecutor engaged in\n\nmisconduct in his closing argument and rebuttal.      There was no\n\ncontemporaneous objection to the closing argument or rebuttal at\n\ntrial, so we review for plain error.   United States v. Figueroa-\n\nEncarnacion, 343 F.3d 23, 27 (1st Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 540\n\nU.S. 1140 (2004).    Review for plain error requires determining\n\nwhether an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not\n\nonly affected the defendant's substantial rights but also seriously\n\nimpaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial\n\nproceedings.   United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   Wilkerson argues there were five separate instances of\n\nprosecutorial misconduct, but we conclude there were none.\n\n          First, Wilkerson asserts that the government improperly\n\nvouched for the credibility of the officers' testimony by arguing\n\nin rebuttal that if the officers wanted to lie they would have made\n\nup a better story. \"[A] prosecutor improperly vouches for a witness\n\nwhen she places the prestige of her office behind the government's\n\ncase by, say, imparting her personal belief in a witness's veracity\n\nor implying that the jury should credit the prosecution's evidence\n\nsimply because the government can be trusted.\"    United States v.\n\nPerez-Ruiz, 353 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2003).       In Perez-Ruiz, we\n\ndetermined that the statement, \"If they [were going to] make up a\n\nstory, wouldn't it have been a better story?\" was not improper\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fvouching, but rather \"a logical counter to the assertions of\n\ndefense counsel       .   .   .    that      various      government         witnesses   had\n\nfabricated their testimony . . . .\"                      Id. at 9-10.         The comments\n\nbefore us are very similar.                   In response to defense counsel's\n\nassertions that the officers may have fabricated their stories, the\n\ngovernment argued that if the officers had wanted to lie, they\n\ncould   have   said    they       saw   defendant        with   a    gun     or    otherwise\n\nembellished    their      testimony          to   make    the   case    better.        These\n\nstatements do not constitute improper vouching. See also Figueroa-\n\nEncarnacion,    343    F.3d       at    29        (admission    of     the    government's\n\nstatements that witnesses could have lied to make a better story\n\nwas \"not remotely plain error\").\n\n           The prosecutor also stated several times in rebuttal that\n\nthe officers \"didn't stretch the truth here\" when noting that the\n\nofficers testified that they saw Wilkerson reach for his budge area\n\nbut did not testify that they actually saw a gun.                                 With these\n\nstatements the prosecutor comes closer to the line of imparting his\n\npersonal belief in the witness's veracity.                      However, there is no\n\nplain error, since if there is error, it is not clear or obvious\n\nand it does not seriously impair the fairness, integrity, or public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings. See United States v. Sullivan,\n\n85 F.3d 743, 751 (1st Cir. 1996) (not plain error where the\n\ngovernment in closing argument and rebuttal stated that one witness\n\n\"came off pretty believable,\" that another \"couldn't have lied\n\n\n                                             -14-\n\fabout anything,\" that another \"told you the truth,\" and that all of\n\nthem \"were up there telling the truth\").\n\n            Second, Wilkerson contends that the government improperly\n\nshifted the burden of proof to the defendant by arguing that, for\n\nthe jury to find that Wilkerson went through the driveway and not\n\nthe alley, they would have to find that Officers Joyce and Fleming\n\ndid not tell the truth.         Wilkerson relies on United States v.\n\nRoberts, 119 F.3d 1006 (1st Cir. 1997), where the court found\n\nimproper    burden   shifting   when   the   government   stated   \"when   a\n\ndefendant does 'go forward' to offer evidence, 'the defendant has\n\nthe same responsibility as the government and that is to present a\n\ncompelling case.'\" Id. at 1015.        The prosecutor's argument in this\n\ncase is not like the statements in Roberts.         Here, the government\n\ndid not argue that Wilkerson had the burden to prove another set of\n\nfacts.     Rather, the government argued that if the jury found that\n\nWilkerson ran up the driveway, they would necessarily have to find\n\nthat the officers did not tell the truth, because the officers\n\ntestified that he ran up the alley.            This logical response to\n\nWilkerson's theory of the case is not plain error.\n\n            Third, Wilkerson argues that the government impermissibly\n\ncommented on Wilkerson's decision not to testify and shifted the\n\nburden of proof when he said \"there's no real evidence\" that he did\n\nnot go up the alley and \"pretty much nothing\" to say that Wilkerson\n\nran up the driveway.     A prosecutor's remarks violate a defendant's\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fFifth Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination if \"in the\n\ncircumstances     of    the    particular       case,    the   language     used     was\n\nmanifestly intended or was of such a character that the jury would\n\nnaturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of\n\nthe accused to testify.\"          United States v. Wihbey, 75 F.3d 761, 769\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).       We are not persuaded the jury would naturally and\n\nnecessarily take the statements to be a comment on Wilkerson's\n\ndecision not to testify.          In the context of the trial, it is likely\n\nthe comments referred to Wilkerson's failure to produce other\n\nevidence supporting his theory of the case.                 At most, the comments\n\nare   ambiguous.        Moreover,     there     was     significant       evidence    of\n\nWilkerson's     guilt    and    the   judge     instructed       the    jury   of    the\n\ndefendant's right not to testify and of the government's burden of\n\nproof.   We conclude that these statements do not rise to the level\n\nof plain error.        See Wihbey at 770-71 (no plain error where there\n\nis ambiguity, jury instruction, and significant evidence of guilt).\n\n           Fourth, Wilkerson contends that the government misstated\n\nthe evidence.          The    prosecutor    stated      several     times    that    the\n\nwitnesses saw something \"heavy\" in Wilkerson's right hand. He also\n\nreferred   to    \"the    fence\"    and    \"that    fence\"      in   the    alley    when\n\ndiscussing      Wilkerson's       post-arrest      statement,          implying     that\n\nWilkerson had identified the fence in the alley to Detective Benton\n\nand had described pulling himself up it.                       These misstatements\n\ninvolved reasonable inferences that the prosecutor asked the jury\n\n\n                                         -16-\n\fto draw from the facts.         They were de minimus and did not stray far\n\nenough from the actual testimony to indicate prejudice or bad\n\nfaith.    Moreover, the judge instructed the jury that the lawyers'\n\nassertions were not evidence.          The statements did not \"so poison[]\n\nthe well that the trial's outcome was likely affected.\" See United\n\nStates v. Morales-Cartagena, 987 F.2d 849, 854 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\nSee also United States v. Yanovitch, 101 F.3d 202, 213 (1st Cir.\n\n1996).    We therefore conclude that these statements were not plain\n\nerror.\n\n            Finally, Wilkerson's claim that the prosecutor demeaned\n\nthe defense by calling one of the defense theories a \"red herring\"\n\nis meritless.     See United States v. Bennett, 75 F.3d 40, 46-47 (1st\n\nCir. 1996)(did not cross the line to call a defense argument a\n\n\"diversion\" that \"doesn't pass the laugh test\").\n\n                                       IV.\n\n            Wilkerson      contends    that    evidence   that    the   gun   was\n\nmanufactured outside of Massachusetts in 1918 is insufficient to\n\nestablish a nexus between the firearm and interstate commerce under\n\nยง 922(g).       He points to the Supreme Court's decisions in United\n\nStates v. Lopez, 514 U.S. 549 (1995), United States v. Morrison,\n\n529 U.S. 598 (2000), and Jones v. United States, 529 U.S. 848\n\n(2000),    as    calling   into    question    whether    the    minimal   nexus\n\nstandard, which requires only that the firearm has traveled in\n\ninterstate      commerce   at   some   time,    sufficiently     satisfies    the\n\n\n                                       -17-\n\finterstate commerce element of ยง 922(g). See Scarborough v. United\n\nStates, 431 U.S. 563, 575-78 (1977)(establishing minimal nexus\n\nstandard).   In United States v. Weems, 322 F.3d 18 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 540 U.S. 892 (2003), we held that Jones does not\n\nalter Scarborough to require proof that the defendant transported\n\nthe firearm in interstate commerce.   Id. at 26.   Every Circuit that\n\nhas addressed the minimal nexus requirement after Morrison and\n\nJones has also concluded that the nexus to interstate commerce is\n\nestablished if the firearm \"has traveled at some time in interstate\n\ncommerce.\"   United States v. Gaines, 295 F.3d 293, 302 (2d Cir.\n\n2002); see also United States v. Darrington, 351 F.3d 632, 634 (5th\n\nCir. 2003), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 2429 (2004); United States v.\n\nGallimore, 247 F.3d 134, 138 (4th Cir. 2001). We likewise conclude\n\nthat the evidence that a firearm has traveled at some time in\n\ninterstate commerce is sufficient to establish a nexus between the\n\nfirearm and interstate commerce.\n\n                                V.\n\n          Wilkerson argues in a supplemental brief that, in light\n\nof the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Booker, 125 S.\n\nCt. 738 (2005), his sentence should be remanded to the district\n\ncourt.   Wilkerson concedes that he did not preserve this issue in\n\nthe district court, so our review is for plain error.         United\n\nStates v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir. 2005).         A\n\ndetermination of plain error is appropriate where \"there [is] an\n\n\n                               -18-\n\f'error' that is 'plain' and that 'affect[s] substantial rights.'\"\n\nId. at 77 (quoting United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732\n\n(1993)).     If those factors are met, we may correct the error only\n\nif   it   \"seriously    affects   the   fairness,   integrity    or   public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\"        Id. (citation omitted).\n\n             Wilkerson satisfies the first two requirements of the\n\nOlano plain error test because his sentence was imposed under a\n\nmandatory Guidelines system.         Id. at 77.     In order to prove the\n\nsecond two requirements, prejudice and fundamental unfairness,\n\nWilkerson need only present a \"reasonable indication that the\n\ndistrict judge might well have reached a different result under\n\nadvisory guidelines.\" United States v. Heldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224\n\n(1st Cir. 2005) (remanding for resentencing where defendant's age\n\nand health were worthy of consideration but did not warrant a\n\ndownward departure under the mandatory Guidelines).\n\n             The district judge sentenced Wilkerson to the lowest\n\navailable sentence under the Guidelines.          He repeatedly expressed\n\nhis concern about disparate treatment between federal and state\n\ncourt sentences in similar cases, but stated that the Guidelines\n\ndid not permit him to take that disparity into account.                   The\n\ndistrict judge also observed that Wilkerson had the most horrible\n\nyoung life he had seen in 17 years on the bench.          Both the need to\n\navoid     unwarranted   sentencing   disparities    and   the   history   and\n\ncharacteristics of the defendant are among the factors to be\n\n\n                                     -19-\n\fconsidered by the now advisory Guidelines.             18 U.S.C. ยง 3553(a).\n\nAs this court recognized in Heldeman, where there is a reasonable\n\nindication    that   the   district    judge   might   well   have   given   a\n\ndifferent sentence under an advisory guidelines regime, and it\n\nwould be easy enough for him to say no with a minimum expenditure\n\nof effort, we are persuaded that remand is required.            402 F.3d at\n\n224. We express no view on whether defendant should be resentenced\n\nor on any possible resentence.\n\n             We affirm Wilkerson's conviction and remand the case to\n\nthe district judge for further sentencing proceedings consistent\n\nwith this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -20-\n\f",

Wilkerson appeals his conviction for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), possessing more than five grams of cocaine base with intent to distribute under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), and carrying a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1). Wilkerson asserts that the district court erred by admitting prior consistent statements of a government witness in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 106 and the common law, permitting a government witness to interpret one of his post-arrest statements in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 701, and allowing the prosecutor to improperly vouch for his witnesses in summation and engage in other forms of prosecutorial misconduct. Wilkerson also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to establish a nexus between the firearm and interstate commerce, and he argues that his sentence should be remanded pursuant to <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). We hold that the district court erred in the admission of prior consistent statements, but this error was harmless. We remand to the district court for resentencing, and we affirm the district court on all other issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boston police officers Tom Joyce and Ed Fleming stopped Wilkerson after he made an illegal U-turn. During the stop, the officers learned he was driving with a suspended license. Officer Joyce asked Wilkerson to step out of the vehicle, but Wilkerson refused. Joyce and Wilkerson struggled for the door while Officer Fleming called for back-up. Wilkerson then drove off and a chase ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The car chase ended when Wilkerson abandoned his vehicle and took off on foot. From about thirty to forty feet away, the officers saw Wilkerson holding his right side around his waist area. Joyce informed his partner, \"Eddie, be careful, I think he has a gun.\" Joyce then broadcast over the radio, \"He's reaching for his budge,\" meaning that Wilkerson was reaching for the waistband area where he thought Wilkerson had a gun. The officers reported that Wilkerson continued to hold his right waist area while they followed him, but they did not actually see a gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers pursued Wilkerson onto Hartwell Street. Officer Joyce testified at trial that he was about sixty feet away when he saw Wilkerson turn into an alley between houses at 11 and 5 Hartwell on the north side of the street. Officer Fleming testified that he had just turned onto Hartwell when he saw the same thing. As Wilkerson turned into the alley, Joyce slowed down and peered down the driveway on the south side of 11 Hartwell, between 11 and 15/17 Hartwell, to see if Wilkerson would come back the opposite way. He did not. When Joyce reached the alley, he saw Wilkerson climbing over a six- or seven-foot-high fence, no longer clutching his waist area. Joyce did not see anything in Wilkerson's hands or belt as he lowered himself over the fence. Joyce did not attempt to scale the fence, but instead turned around and ran up the driveway. There Joyce saw Wilkerson running west through the backyards toward Cheney Street. Officers from another police unit arrested Wilkerson when they caught him running at a slow jog on Maple Street near Cheney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Wilkerson's arrest, officers were ordered to retrace the route of the foot chase looking for anything he might have discarded. Another officer accompanied by Joyce found a gun and 12.55 grams of crack cocaine in the alley between 11 and 5 Hartwell. The items were described as clean and dry and lying on top of damp, dirty refuse. The gun was cocked, loaded, and ready to be fired. The key factual dispute at trial was whether Wilkerson ran up the alley where the gun and drugs were found, between 5 and 11 Hartwell, or whether he ran up the driveway between 11 and 15/17 Hartwell, which he would have had to pass before reaching the alley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both of the evidentiary issues Wilkerson raises on appeal involve testimony about his flight path on Hartwell Street. We first address Federal Rule of Evidence 106 and the common law to determine when prior consistent statements may be used to rehabilitate a witness's credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer Fleming testified that he saw Wilkerson turn into the alley between 5 and 11 Hartwell. Defense counsel attempted to impeach Fleming's credibility on this subject by eliciting testimony that (1) he did not describe the alley in the radio broadcasts he made while chasing Wilkerson, (2) he referred to the alley as a driveway in his police report, and (3) in state grand jury testimony he stated that Wilkerson ran between the second and third houses on Hartwell, which would be between 15/17 and 11 if counting from the direction in which they ran. Fleming was impeached on other subjects with his federal grand jury testimony, but none concerned Wilkerson's flight path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To rehabilitate his credibility, the government asked Officer Fleming on redirect examination, \"[A]t any time prior to writing the report or in testifying in this case, did you ever indicate that [Wilkerson] ran up anyplace other than that area between 5 and 11 Hartwell?\" He answered no. He was then asked, \"[A]t any prior time, writing a report or in your prior testimony, did you indicate that the defendant ran up any location other than this location between 5 and 11 Hartwell?\" Again he answered no. Finally he was asked, referring to his federal grand jury testimony, \"[D]o you recall what you said in that testimony?\" Fleming answered:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. I testified to the fact that I saw the defendant run on to Hartwell Street and run up an alleyway between two homes on Hartwell Street.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Q. And were you shown two photographs in the grand jury?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

As the alleyway the defendant ran.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defense counsel objected to this line of questioning. She argued that the testimony was hearsay and should not be allowed as non-hearsay prior consistent statements under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) because it was not offered to rebut a charge of recent fabrication. The district court agreed and ruled that Fleming's testimony could not be admitted under Rule 801. Instead, the court allowed the testimony under Rule 106<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>, the rule of completeness. Defense counsel maintained her objection. The district court, sua sponte, gave a limiting instruction directing the jury to consider the testimony only for the officer's credibility and not for the truth of the statements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's ruling for abuse of discretion. <i>See United States v. Millan,</i> 230 F.3d 431, 434 (1st Cir.2000). We conclude that the district court erred in admitting the testimony, but the error is harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>United States v. Simonelli,</i> 237 F.3d 19, 25-29 (1st Cir.2001), this court addressed the same issues presented here. On cross-examination, a witness's prior inconsistent statements were used to impeach his credibility. On redirect the government asked the witness about statements he made to the grand jury which were consistent with his trial testimony. Some of the questions went beyond the specific points covered on cross-examination, but all were within its general scope. Many of the statements were used only to rehabilitate the witness, rather than as substantive evidence. <i>See id.</i> at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Simonelli</i> we stated that when prior consistent statements are admitted to rehabilitate a witness, admissibility is \"determined by the interplay between the rule of completeness and the common law doctrine about prior consistent statements.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. We noted that both the rule of completeness and the common law doctrine allow prior consistent statements when they tend to show that a statement used to impeach a witness is not really inconsistent when understood in its proper context. <i>See id.</i> at 27-28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that Officer Fleming's testimony was properly admitted because it was offered to rebut the impression created by defense counsel's cross-examination that Officer Fleming had given conflicting or uncertain accounts of Wilkerson's flight path. However, <i>Simonelli</i> makes clear that prior consistent statements must at least have \"some rebutting force beyond the mere fact that the witness has repeated on a prior occasion a statement consistent with his trial testimony.\" <i>See id.</i> at 27 (quoting <i>United States v. Pierre,</i> 781 F.2d 329, 331 (2d Cir.1986)). The redirect testimony at issue does not meet the required standard. Defense counsel cross-examined Officer Fleming about inconsistencies in the way he described Wilkerson's flight path and his failure to broadcast information about the alley over the police radio. Confirming on redirect that the officer had never described a different flight path did not clarify or otherwise provide context for the statements used to impeach Fleming. Rather, the testimony only bolstered Officer Fleming's credibility generally by restating what had already been said. That kind of rehabilitation is impermissible. <i>See Simonelli,</i> 237 F.3d at 28 (\"There is no rule admitting all prior consistent statements simply to bolster the credibility of a witness who has been impeached by particulars.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that any error in admitting the testimony is harmless. \"A non-constitutional evidentiary error is harmless ... so long as it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\" <i>United States v. Piper,</i> 298 F.3d 47, 56 (1st Cir.2002). Several factors lead us to conclude that the error is harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's case against Wilkerson was strong even without Officer Fleming's redirect testimony. Wilkerson drove away from the officers, prompting a car chase; Wilkerson abandoned his vehicle and ran from the officers on foot; both officers saw Wilkerson holding his waist area and believed he had a gun; Officer Joyce warned other officers over the police radio that Wilkerson was reaching for his \"budge,\" a term that conveyed Joyce's belief that Wilkerson had a gun; Joyce, who followed closer behind Wilkerson during the chase and was the government's key witness, also testified that he saw Wilkerson run up the alley where the gun and drugs were found; the gun and drugs were clean and dry in an otherwise damp and dirty alley, indicating that they had not been there very long; and shortly after running from the alley where the gun and drugs were found, Wilkerson gave up the chase. The exculpatory evidence Wilkerson presented at trial was minimal and unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Officer Fleming's redirect testimony was not unique and was used only to rehabilitate his credibility. \"By definition, prior consistent statements do not consist of new substantive information. Their impact comes from corroborating other, perhaps less compelling, evidence.\" <i>United States v. Awon,</i> 135 F.3d 96, 101 (1st Cir.1998). At most the testimony strengthened Officer Fleming's previous testimony by corroborating his story. While this may warrant a new trial in some cases, it is highly probable that the corroborating testimony did not influence the verdict in this case. We conclude that the district court's error is harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second evidentiary issue Wilkerson raises is whether the district court violated Federal Rule of Evidence 701 by allowing a government witness to interpret one of Wilkerson's post-arrest statements. The decision to admit lay opinion testimony pursuant to Rule 701 is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Tom,</i> 330 F.3d 83, 94 (1st Cir.2003). We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilkerson described his route during the foot chase in an interview after his arrest with Boston Police Detective Jeremiah Benton. Detective Benton testified that Wilkerson told him that \"he grabbed the tall fence to get up on the small fence.\" Over defendant's objection, Benton testified that he understood the defendant \"to mean that he grabbed on to a higher fence to pull himself up on to a lower fence to get over the higher fence.\" Detective Benton then illustrated this testimony by pointing to parts of a fence in a photograph of the alley between 11 and 5 Hartwell. In its closing argument, the government asserted that Wilkerson's post-arrest statement referred to the fence in the back of the alley in which Officers Joyce and Fleming saw the defendant run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that this testimony is admissible under Rule 701, which permits the admission of lay opinion testimony only when it is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) rationally based on the perception of the witness,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 701. Wilkerson argues that the testimony did not meet the requirements of (a) or (b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first element of Rule 701 is \"the familiar requirement of first-hand knowledge or observation.\" Fed.R.Evid. 701 advisory committee's note. This court has noted that the requirement is met when the testimony is based on the personal perception of the witness and does not require any irrational leaps of logic for the witness to render the opinion. <i>See Lynch v. City of Boston,</i> 180 F.3d 1, 16 (1st Cir.1999). Wilkerson argues that this test is not met because Detective Benton lacked any special understanding of what Wilkerson meant and he had no special familiarity with the area. This argument is unpersuasive. Detective Benton testified that he was familiar with the alley in which the gun and drugs were found and with the driveway that defense counsel argued Wilkerson used to flee. He walked up the alley before interviewing Wilkerson, he viewed the driveway the same night of Wilkerson's arrest, and he walked up the driveway the next day. He was thus in a position to assess which fence Wilkerson referred to in his statement. Benton's opinion is therefore rationally based on his perception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilkerson also argues that the \"helpfulness\" requirement is not met because the statement itself is clear and the jury had other evidence before it from which it could determine which area Wilkerson was describing. Wilkerson points to several cases holding that the interpretation of clear statements is not helpful to the jury. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Dicker,</i> 853 F.2d 1103, 1109 (3d Cir.1988)(\"[T]he interpretation of <i>clear</i> statements is not permissible, and is barred by the helpfulness requirement of ... Fed.R.Evid. 701.\"). However, these cases involve the interpretation of facially clear and coherent statements. Wilkerson's statement that he \"grabbed the tall fence to get up on the small fence\" is vague and confusing. It is not at all clear from the photographs of the alley and the driveway what Wilkerson meant. Detective Benton saw the area immediately after Wilkerson's arrest. He walked through the alley before taking Wilkerson's statement and walked through the driveway the next morning. Although the jury viewed the area, it was before they heard any testimony. Under the circumstances, the district court could have reasonably determined that Detective Benton was in a unique position to help the jury understand what Wilkerson might have meant. <i>See Tom,</i> 330 F.3d at 94. Accordingly, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilkerson also contends that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct in his closing argument and rebuttal. There was no contemporaneous objection to the closing argument or rebuttal at trial, so we review for plain error. <i>United States v. Figueroa-Encarnacion,</i> 343 F.3d 23, 27 (1st Cir.2003), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 1140, 124 S.Ct. 1130, 157 L.Ed.2d 951 (2004). Review for plain error requires determining whether an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant's substantial rights but also seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). Wilkerson argues there were five separate instances of prosecutorial misconduct, but we conclude there were none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Wilkerson asserts that the government improperly vouched for the credibility of the officers' testimony by arguing in rebuttal that if the officers wanted to lie they would have made up a better story. \"[A] prosecutor improperly vouches for a witness when she places the prestige of her office behind the government's case by, say, imparting her personal belief in a witness's veracity or implying that the jury should credit the prosecution's evidence simply because the government can be trusted.\" <i>United States v. Perez-Ruiz,</i> 353 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.2003). In <i>Perez-Ruiz,</i> we determined that the statement, \"If they [were going to] make up a story, wouldn't it have been a better story?\" was not improper vouching, but rather \"a logical counter to the assertions of defense counsel ... that various government witnesses had fabricated their testimony....\" <i>Id.</i> at 9-10. The comments before us are very similar. In response to defense counsel's assertions that the officers may have fabricated their stories, the government argued that if the officers had wanted to lie, they could have said they saw defendant with a gun or otherwise embellished their testimony to make the case better. These statements do not constitute improper vouching. <i>See also Figueroa-Encarnacion,</i> 343 F.3d at 29 (admission of the government's statements that witnesses could have lied to make a better story was \"not remotely plain error\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor also stated several times in rebuttal that the officers \"didn't stretch the truth here\" when noting that the officers testified that they saw Wilkerson reach for his budge area but did not testify that they actually saw a gun. With these statements the prosecutor comes closer to the line of imparting his personal belief in the witness's veracity. However, there is no plain error, since if there is error, it is not clear or obvious and it does not seriously impair the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>See United States v. Sullivan,</i> 85 F.3d 743, 751 (1st Cir.1996) (not plain error where the government in closing argument and rebuttal stated that one witness \"came off pretty believable,\" that another \"couldn't have lied about anything,\" that another \"told you the truth,\" and that all of them \"were up there telling the truth\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Wilkerson contends that the government improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant by arguing that, for the jury to find that Wilkerson went through the driveway and not the alley, they would have to find that Officers Joyce and Fleming did not tell the truth. Wilkerson relies on <i>United States v. Roberts,</i> 119 F.3d 1006 (1st Cir.1997), where the court found improper burden shifting when the government stated \"when a defendant does `go forward' to offer evidence, `the defendant has the same responsibility as the government and that is to present a compelling case.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 1015. The prosecutor's argument in this case is not like the statements in <i>Roberts.</i> Here, the government did not argue that Wilkerson had the burden to prove another set of facts. Rather, the government argued that if the jury found that Wilkerson ran up the driveway, they would necessarily have to find that the officers did not tell the truth, because the officers testified that he ran up the alley. This logical response to Wilkerson's theory of the case is not plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Wilkerson argues that the government impermissibly commented on Wilkerson's decision not to testify and shifted the burden of proof when he said \"there's no real evidence\" that he did not go up the alley and \"pretty much nothing\" to say that Wilkerson ran up the driveway. A prosecutor's remarks violate a defendant's Fifth Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination if \"in the circumstances of the particular case, the language used was manifestly intended or was of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\" <i>United States v. Wihbey,</i> 75 F.3d 761, 769 (1st Cir.1996). We are not persuaded the jury would naturally and necessarily take the statements to be a comment on Wilkerson's decision not to testify. In the context of the trial, it is likely the comments referred to Wilkerson's failure to produce other evidence supporting his theory of the case. At most, the comments are ambiguous. Moreover, there was significant evidence of Wilkerson's guilt and the judge instructed the jury of the defendant's right not to testify and of the government's burden of proof. We conclude that these statements do not rise to the level of plain error. <i>See Wihbey</i> at 770-71 (no plain error where there is ambiguity, jury instruction, and significant evidence of guilt).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, Wilkerson contends that the government misstated the evidence. The prosecutor stated several times that the witnesses saw something \"heavy\" in Wilkerson's right hand. He also referred to \"the fence\" and \"that fence\" in the alley when discussing Wilkerson's post-arrest statement, implying that Wilkerson had identified the fence in the alley to Detective Benton and had described pulling himself up it. These misstatements involved reasonable inferences that the prosecutor asked the jury to draw from the facts. They were de minimus and did not stray far enough from the actual testimony to indicate prejudice or bad faith. Moreover, the judge instructed the jury that the lawyers' assertions were not evidence. The statements did not \"so poison [ ] the well that the trial's outcome was likely affected.\" <i>See United States v. Morales-Cartagena,</i> 987 F.2d 849, 854 (1st Cir.1993). <i>See also United States v. Yanovitch,</i> 101 F.3d 202, 213 (1st Cir.1996). We therefore conclude that these statements were not plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Wilkerson's claim that the prosecutor demeaned the defense by calling one of the defense theories a \"red herring\" is meritless. <i>See United States v. Bennett,</i> 75 F.3d 40, 46-47 (1st Cir.1996)(did not cross the line to call a defense argument a \"diversion\" that \"doesn't pass the laugh test\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilkerson contends that evidence that the gun was manufactured outside of Massachusetts in 1918 is insufficient to establish a nexus between the firearm and interstate commerce under &#167; 922(g). He points to the Supreme Court's decisions in <i>United States v. Lopez,</i> 514 U.S. 549, 115 S.Ct. 1624, 131 L.Ed.2d 626 (1995), <i>United States v. Morrison,</i> 529 U.S. 598, 120 S.Ct. 1740, 146 L.Ed.2d 658 (2000), and <i>Jones v. United States,</i> 529 U.S. 848, 120 S.Ct. 1904, 146 L.Ed.2d 902 (2000), as calling into question whether the minimal nexus standard, which requires only that the firearm has traveled in interstate commerce at some time, sufficiently satisfies the interstate commerce element of &#167; 922(g). <i>See Scarborough v. United States,</i> 431 U.S. 563, 575-78, 97 S.Ct. 1963, 52 L.Ed.2d 582 (1977)(establishing minimal nexus standard). In <i>United States v. Weems,</i> 322 F.3d 18 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 540 U.S. 892, 124 S.Ct. 233, 157 L.Ed.2d 167 (2003), we held that <i>Jones</i> does not alter <i>Scarborough</i> to require proof that the defendant transported the firearm in interstate commerce. <i>Id.</i> at 26. Every Circuit that has addressed the minimal nexus requirement after <i>Morrison</i> and <i>Jones</i> has also concluded that the nexus to interstate commerce is established if the firearm \"has traveled at some time in interstate commerce.\" <i>United States v. Gaines,</i> 295 F.3d 293, 302 (2d Cir.2002); <i>see also United States v. Darrington,</i> 351 F.3d 632, 634 (5th Cir.2003), <i>cert. denied,</i> 541 U.S. 1080, 124 S.Ct. 2429, 158 L.Ed.2d 994 (2004); <i>United States v. Gallimore,</i> 247 F.3d 134, 138 (4th Cir.2001). We likewise conclude that the evidence that a firearm has traveled at some time in interstate commerce is sufficient to establish a nexus between the firearm and interstate commerce.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilkerson argues in a supplemental brief that, in light of the Supreme Court's decision in <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005), his sentence should be remanded to the district court. Wilkerson concedes that he did not preserve this issue in the district court, so our review is for plain error. <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir.2005). A determination of plain error is appropriate where \"there [is] an `error' that is `plain' and that `affect[s] substantial rights.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 77 (quoting <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)). If those factors are met, we may correct the error only if it \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilkerson satisfies the first two requirements of the <i>Olano</i> plain error test because his sentence was imposed under a mandatory Guidelines system. <i>Id.</i> at 77. In order to prove the second two requirements, prejudice and fundamental unfairness, Wilkerson need only present a \"reasonable indication that the district judge might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines.\" <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.2005) (remanding for resentencing where defendant's age and health were worthy of consideration but did not warrant a downward departure under the mandatory Guidelines).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district judge sentenced Wilkerson to the lowest available sentence under the Guidelines. He repeatedly expressed his concern about disparate treatment between federal and state court sentences in similar cases, but stated that the Guidelines did not permit him to take that disparity into account. The district judge also observed that Wilkerson had the most horrible young life he had seen in 17 years on the bench. Both the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities and the history and characteristics of the defendant are among the factors to be considered by the now advisory Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a). As this court recognized in <i>Heldeman,</i> where there is a reasonable indication that the district judge might well have given a different sentence under an advisory guidelines regime, and it would be easy enough for him to say no with a minimum expenditure of effort, we are persuaded that remand is required. 402 F.3d at 224. We express no view on whether defendant should be resentenced or on any possible resentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm Wilkerson's conviction and remand the case to the district judge for further sentencing proceedings consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> \"When a writing or recorded statement or part thereof is introduced by a party, an adverse party may require the introduction at that time of any other part or any other writing or recorded statement which ought in fairness to be considered contemporaneously with it.\" Fed.R.Evid. 106</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

Wilkerson appeals his conviction for possessing a firearm as a convicted felon under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1), possessing more than five grams of cocaine base with intent to distribute under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1), and carrying a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking offense under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 924(c)(1). Wilkerson asserts that the district court erred by admitting prior consistent statements of a government witness in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 106 and the common law, permitting a government witness to interpret one of his post-arrest statements in violation of Fed.R.Evid. 701, and allowing the prosecutor to improperly vouch for his witnesses in summation and engage in other forms of prosecutorial misconduct. Wilkerson also challenges the sufficiency of the evidence to establish a nexus between the firearm and interstate commerce, and he argues that his sentence should be remanded pursuant to <i>United States v. Booker,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We remand to the district court for resentencing, and we affirm the district court on all other issues.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Boston police officers Tom Joyce and Ed Fleming stopped Wilkerson after he made an illegal U-turn. During the stop, the officers learned he was driving with a suspended license. Officer Joyce asked Wilkerson to step out of the vehicle, but Wilkerson refused. Joyce and Wilkerson struggled for the door while Officer Fleming called for back-up. Wilkerson then drove off and a chase ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The car chase ended when Wilkerson abandoned his vehicle and took off on foot. From about thirty to forty feet away, the officers saw Wilkerson holding his right side around his waist area. Joyce informed his partner, \"Eddie, be careful, I think he has a gun.\" Joyce then broadcast over the radio, \"He's reaching for his budge,\" meaning that Wilkerson was reaching for the waistband area where he thought Wilkerson had a gun. The officers reported that Wilkerson continued to hold his right waist area while they followed him, but they did not actually see a gun.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The officers pursued Wilkerson onto Hartwell Street. Officer Joyce testified at trial that he was about sixty feet away when he saw Wilkerson turn into an alley between houses at 11 and 5 Hartwell on the north side of the street. Officer Fleming testified that he had just turned onto Hartwell when he saw the same thing. As Wilkerson turned into the alley, Joyce slowed down and peered down the driveway on the south side of 11 Hartwell, between 11 and 15/17 Hartwell, to see if Wilkerson would come back the opposite way. He did not. When Joyce reached the alley, he saw Wilkerson climbing over a six- or seven-foot-high fence, no longer clutching his waist area. Joyce did not see anything in Wilkerson's hands or belt as he lowered himself over the fence. Joyce did not attempt to scale the fence, but instead turned around and ran up the driveway. There Joyce saw Wilkerson running west through the backyards toward Cheney Street. Officers from another police unit arrested Wilkerson when they caught him running at a slow jog on Maple Street near Cheney.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Wilkerson's arrest, officers were ordered to retrace the route of the foot chase looking for anything he might have discarded. Another officer accompanied by Joyce found a gun and 12.55 grams of crack cocaine in the alley between 11 and 5 Hartwell. The items were described as clean and dry and lying on top of damp, dirty refuse. The gun was cocked, loaded, and ready to be fired. The key factual dispute at trial was whether Wilkerson ran up the alley where the gun and drugs were found, between 5 and 11 Hartwell, or whether he ran up the driveway between 11 and 15/17 Hartwell, which he would have had to pass before reaching the alley.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both of the evidentiary issues Wilkerson raises on appeal involve testimony about his flight path on Hartwell Street.

Defense counsel attempted to impeach Fleming's credibility on this subject by eliciting testimony that (1) he did not describe the alley in the radio broadcasts he made while chasing Wilkerson, (2) he referred to the alley as a driveway in his police report, and (3) in state grand jury testimony he stated that Wilkerson ran between the second and third houses on Hartwell, which would be between 15/17 and 11 if counting from the direction in which they ran. Fleming was impeached on other subjects with his federal grand jury testimony, but none concerned Wilkerson's flight path.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To rehabilitate his credibility, the government asked Officer Fleming on redirect examination, \"[A]t any time prior to writing the report or in testifying in this case, did you ever indicate that [Wilkerson] ran up anyplace other than that area between 5 and 11 Hartwell?\" He answered no. He was then asked, \"[A]t any prior time, writing a report or in your prior testimony, did you indicate that the defendant ran up any location other than this location between 5 and 11 Hartwell?\" Again he answered no. Finally he was asked, referring to his federal grand jury testimony, \"[D]o you recall what you said in that testimony?\" Fleming answered:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A.

She argued that the testimony was hearsay and should not be allowed as non-hearsay prior consistent statements under Federal Rule of Evidence 801(d)(1)(B) because it was not offered to rebut a charge of recent fabrication. The district court agreed and ruled that Fleming's testimony could not be admitted under Rule 801. Instead, the court allowed the testimony under Rule 106<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>, the rule of completeness. Defense counsel maintained her objection.

On cross-examination, a witness's prior inconsistent statements were used to impeach his credibility. On redirect the government asked the witness about statements he made to the grand jury which were consistent with his trial testimony. Some of the questions went beyond the specific points covered on cross-examination, but all were within its general scope. Many of the statements were used only to rehabilitate the witness, rather than as substantive evidence. <i>See id.</i> at 26.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Simonelli</i> we stated that when prior consistent statements are admitted to rehabilitate a witness, admissibility is \"determined by the interplay between the rule of completeness and the common law doctrine about prior consistent statements.\" <i>Id.</i> at 27. We noted that both the rule of completeness and the common law doctrine allow prior consistent statements when they tend to show that a statement used to impeach a witness is not really inconsistent when understood in its proper context. <i>See id.</i> at 27-28.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that Officer Fleming's testimony was properly admitted because it was offered to rebut the impression created by defense counsel's cross-examination that Officer Fleming had given conflicting or uncertain accounts of Wilkerson's flight path. However, <i>Simonelli</i> makes clear that prior consistent statements must at least have \"some rebutting force beyond the mere fact that the witness has repeated on a prior occasion a statement consistent with his trial testimony.\" <i>See id.</i> at 27 (quoting <i>United States v. Pierre,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"463300\"><a href=\"/opinion/463300/united-states-v-michel-pierre/\"><span class=\"volume\">781</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">329</span></a></span>, 331 (2d Cir.1986)). The redirect testimony at issue does not meet the required standard. Defense counsel cross-examined Officer Fleming about inconsistencies in the way he described Wilkerson's flight path and his failure to broadcast information about the alley over the police radio. Confirming on redirect that the officer had never described a different flight path did not clarify or otherwise provide context for the statements used to impeach Fleming. Rather, the testimony only bolstered Officer Fleming's credibility generally by restating what had already been said. That kind of rehabilitation is impermissible. <i>See Simonelli,</i> 237 F.3d at 28 (\"There is no rule admitting all prior consistent statements simply to bolster the credibility of a witness who has been impeached by particulars.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that any error in admitting the testimony is harmless. \"A non-constitutional evidentiary error is harmless ... so long as it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\" <i>United States v.

Several factors lead us to conclude that the error is harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's case against Wilkerson was strong even without Officer Fleming's redirect testimony. Wilkerson drove away from the officers, prompting a car chase; Wilkerson abandoned his vehicle and ran from the officers on foot; both officers saw Wilkerson holding his waist area and believed he had a gun; Officer Joyce warned other officers over the police radio that Wilkerson was reaching for his \"budge,\" a term that conveyed Joyce's belief that Wilkerson had a gun; Joyce, who followed closer behind Wilkerson during the chase and was the government's key witness, also testified that he saw Wilkerson run up the alley where the gun and drugs were found; the gun and drugs were clean and dry in an otherwise damp and dirty alley, indicating that they had not been there very long; and shortly after running from the alley where the gun and drugs were found, Wilkerson gave up the chase. The exculpatory evidence Wilkerson presented at trial was minimal and unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Officer Fleming's redirect testimony was not unique and was used only to rehabilitate his credibility. \"By definition, prior consistent statements do not consist of new substantive information. Their impact comes from corroborating other, perhaps less compelling, evidence.\" <i>United States v.

At most the testimony strengthened Officer Fleming's previous testimony by corroborating his story. While this may warrant a new trial in some cases, it is highly probable that the corroborating testimony did not influence the verdict in this case. We conclude that the district court's error is harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The second evidentiary issue Wilkerson raises is whether the district court violated Federal Rule of Evidence 701 by allowing a government witness to interpret one of Wilkerson's post-arrest statements. The decision to admit lay opinion testimony pursuant to Rule 701 is reviewed for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Tom,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"782082\"><a href=\"/opinion/782082/united-states-v-luis-tom-aka-cuba/\"><span class=\"volume\">330</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 94 (1st Cir.2003). We conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilkerson described his route during the foot chase in an interview after his arrest with Boston Police Detective Jeremiah Benton. Detective Benton testified that Wilkerson told him that \"he grabbed the tall fence to get up on the small fence.\" Over defendant's objection, Benton testified that he understood the defendant \"to mean that he grabbed on to a higher fence to pull himself up on to a lower fence to get over the higher fence.\" Detective Benton then illustrated this testimony by pointing to parts of a fence in a photograph of the alley between 11 and 5 Hartwell. In its closing argument, the government asserted that Wilkerson's post-arrest statement referred to the fence in the back of the alley in which Officers Joyce and Fleming saw the defendant run.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government argues that this testimony is admissible under Rule 701, which permits the admission of lay opinion testimony only when it is:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a) rationally based on the perception of the witness,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(b) helpful to a clear understanding of the witness' testimony or the determination of a fact in issue, and (c) not based on scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge within the scope of Rule 702.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Evid. 701. Wilkerson argues that the testimony did not meet the requirements of (a) or (b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The first element of Rule 701 is \"the familiar requirement of first-hand knowledge or observation.\" Fed.R.Evid. 701 advisory committee's note. This court has noted that the requirement is met when the testimony is based on the personal perception of the witness and does not require any irrational leaps of logic for the witness to render the opinion. <i>See Lynch v. City of Boston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198518\"><a href=\"/opinion/198518/lynch-v-city-of-boston/\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 16 (1st Cir.1999). Wilkerson argues that this test is not met because Detective Benton lacked any special understanding of what Wilkerson meant and he had no special familiarity with the area. This argument is unpersuasive. Detective Benton testified that he was familiar with the alley in which the gun and drugs were found and with the driveway that defense counsel argued Wilkerson used to flee. He walked up the alley before interviewing Wilkerson, he viewed the driveway the same night of Wilkerson's arrest, and he walked up the driveway the next day. He was thus in a position to assess which fence Wilkerson referred to in his statement. Benton's opinion is therefore rationally based on his perception.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilkerson also argues that the \"helpfulness\" requirement is not met because the statement itself is clear and the jury had other evidence before it from which it could determine which area Wilkerson was describing. Wilkerson points to several cases holding that the interpretation of clear statements is not helpful to the jury. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Dicker,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"510040\"><a href=\"/opinion/510040/united-states-v-dicker-leon/\"><span class=\"volume\">853</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1103</span></a></span>, 1109 (3d Cir.1988)(\"[T]he interpretation of <i>clear</i> statements is not permissible, and is barred by the helpfulness requirement of ... Fed.R.Evid. 701.\"). However, these cases involve the interpretation of facially clear and coherent statements. Wilkerson's statement that he \"grabbed the tall fence to get up on the small fence\" is vague and confusing. It is not at all clear from the photographs of the alley and the driveway what Wilkerson meant. Detective Benton saw the area immediately after Wilkerson's arrest. He walked through the alley before taking Wilkerson's statement and walked through the driveway the next morning. Although the jury viewed the area, it was before they heard any testimony. Under the circumstances, the district court could have reasonably determined that Detective Benton was in a unique position to help the jury understand what Wilkerson might have meant. <i>See Tom,</i> 330 F.3d at 94. Accordingly, we conclude the district court did not abuse its discretion in admitting the testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilkerson also contends that the prosecutor engaged in misconduct in his closing argument and rebuttal. There was no contemporaneous objection to the closing argument or rebuttal at trial, so we review for plain error. <i>United States v. Figueroa-Encarnacion,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"783504\"><a href=\"/opinion/783504/united-states-v-ramon-figueroa-encarnacion-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">343</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">23</span></a></span>, 27 (1st Cir.2003), <i>cert. denied,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">540</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">1140</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Review for plain error requires determining whether an error occurred which was clear or obvious and which not only affected the defendant's substantial rights but also seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001). Wilkerson argues there were five separate instances of prosecutorial misconduct, but we conclude there were none.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, Wilkerson asserts that the government improperly vouched for the credibility of the officers' testimony by arguing in rebuttal that if the officers wanted to lie they would have made up a better story. \"[A] prosecutor improperly vouches for a witness when she places the prestige of her office behind the government's case by, say, imparting her personal belief in a witness's veracity or implying that the jury should credit the prosecution's evidence simply because the government can be trusted.\" <i>United States v. Perez-Ruiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200773\"><a href=\"/opinion/200773/united-states-v-perez-ruiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">353</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.2003). In <i>Perez-Ruiz,</i> we determined that the statement, \"If they [were going to] make up a story, wouldn't it have been a better story?\" was not improper vouching, but rather \"a logical counter to the assertions of defense counsel ... that various government witnesses had fabricated their testimony....\" <i>Id.</i> at 9-10. The comments before us are very similar. In response to defense counsel's assertions that the officers may have fabricated their stories, the government argued that if the officers had wanted to lie, they could have said they saw defendant with a gun or otherwise embellished their testimony to make the case better. These statements do not constitute improper vouching. <i>See also Figueroa-Encarnacion,</i> 343 F.3d at 29 (admission of the government's statements that witnesses could have lied to make a better story was \"not remotely plain error\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecutor also stated several times in rebuttal that the officers \"didn't stretch the truth here\" when noting that the officers testified that they saw Wilkerson reach for his budge area but did not testify that they actually saw a gun. With these statements the prosecutor comes closer to the line of imparting his personal belief in the witness's veracity. However, there is no plain error, since if there is error, it is not clear or obvious and it does not seriously impair the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>See United States v. Sullivan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196791\"><a href=\"/opinion/196791/united-states-v-sullivan/\"><span class=\"volume\">85</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">743</span></a></span>, 751 (1st Cir.1996) (not plain error where the government in closing argument and rebuttal stated that one witness \"came off pretty believable,\" that another \"couldn't have lied about anything,\" that another \"told you the truth,\" and that all of them \"were up there telling the truth\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, Wilkerson contends that the government improperly shifted the burden of proof to the defendant by arguing that, for the jury to find that Wilkerson went through the driveway and not the alley, they would have to find that Officers Joyce and Fleming did not tell the truth. Wilkerson relies on <i>United States v. Roberts,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197474\"><a href=\"/opinion/197474/united-states-v-roberts/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1006</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1997), where the court found improper burden shifting when the government stated \"when a defendant does `go forward' to offer evidence, `the defendant has the same responsibility as the government and that is to present a compelling case.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 1015. The prosecutor's argument in this case is not like the statements in <i>Roberts.</i> Here, the government did not argue that Wilkerson had the burden to prove another set of facts. Rather, the government argued that if the jury found that Wilkerson ran up the driveway, they would necessarily have to find that the officers did not tell the truth, because the officers testified that he ran up the alley. This logical response to Wilkerson's theory of the case is not plain error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, Wilkerson argues that the government impermissibly commented on Wilkerson's decision not to testify and shifted the burden of proof when he said \"there's no real evidence\" that he did not go up the alley and \"pretty much nothing\" to say that Wilkerson ran up the driveway. A prosecutor's remarks violate a defendant's Fifth Amendment guarantee against self-incrimination if \"in the circumstances of the particular case, the language used was manifestly intended or was of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be a comment on the failure of the accused to testify.\" <i>United States v. Wihbey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196557\"><a href=\"/opinion/196557/united-states-v-wihbey/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">761</span></a></span>, 769 (1st Cir.1996). We are not persuaded the jury would naturally and necessarily take the statements to be a comment on Wilkerson's decision not to testify. In the context of the trial, it is likely the comments referred to Wilkerson's failure to produce other evidence supporting his theory of the case. At most, the comments are ambiguous. Moreover, there was significant evidence of Wilkerson's guilt and the judge instructed the jury of the defendant's right not to testify and of the government's burden of proof. We conclude that these statements do not rise to the level of plain error. <i>See Wihbey</i> at 770-71 (no plain error where there is ambiguity, jury instruction, and significant evidence of guilt).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fourth, Wilkerson contends that the government misstated the evidence. The prosecutor stated several times that the witnesses saw something \"heavy\" in Wilkerson's right hand. He also referred to \"the fence\" and \"that fence\" in the alley when discussing Wilkerson's post-arrest statement, implying that Wilkerson had identified the fence in the alley to Detective Benton and had described pulling himself up it. These misstatements involved reasonable inferences that the prosecutor asked the jury to draw from the facts. They were de minimus and did not stray far enough from the actual testimony to indicate prejudice or bad faith. Moreover, the judge instructed the jury that the lawyers' assertions were not evidence. The statements did not \"so poison [ ] the well that the trial's outcome was likely affected.\" <i>See United States v. Morales-Cartagena,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601780\"><a href=\"/opinion/601780/united-states-v-angel-luis-morales-cartagena-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span>, 854 (1st Cir.1993). <i>See also United States v.

Bennett,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196545\"><a href=\"/opinion/196545/united-states-v-bennett/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">40</span></a></span>, 46-47 (1st Cir.1996)(did not cross the line to call a defense argument a \"diversion\" that \"doesn't pass the laugh test\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wilkerson contends that evidence that the gun was manufactured outside of Massachusetts in 1918 is insufficient to establish a nexus between the firearm and interstate commerce under &#167; 922(g).

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005), his sentence should be remanded to the district court. Wilkerson concedes that he did not preserve this issue in the district court, so our review is for plain error. <i>United States v.

A determination of plain error is appropriate where \"there [is] an `error' that is `plain' and that `affect[s] substantial rights.'\" <i>Id.</i> at 77 (quoting <i>United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 732, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

In order to prove the second two requirements, prejudice and fundamental unfairness, Wilkerson need only present a \"reasonable indication that the district judge might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines.\" <i>United States v.

He repeatedly expressed his concern about disparate treatment between federal and state court sentences in similar cases, but stated that the Guidelines did not permit him to take that disparity into account. The district judge also observed that Wilkerson had the most horrible young life he had seen in 17 years on the bench. Both the need to avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities and the history and characteristics of the defendant are among the factors to be considered by the now advisory Guidelines. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a). As this court recognized in <i>Heldeman,</i> where there is a reasonable indication that the district judge might well have given a different sentence under an advisory guidelines regime, and it would be easy enough for him to say no with a minimum expenditure of effort, we are persuaded that remand is required. 402 F.3d at 224.
