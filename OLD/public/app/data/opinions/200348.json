Mark L. Wolf,    U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                       Howard, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Bownes and Stahl, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Joseph L.

This is an appeal by\n\nplaintiffs-appellants Sportfolio Publications, Inc. (\"Sportfolio\")\n\nand Andrew P. Buckley, its owner and manager, from a summary\n\njudgment issued by the district court in favor of defendant-\n\nappellee, AT&T Corporation (\"AT&T\").1        The main issue in this case\n\nis whether AT&T improperly withheld monies due to Sportfolio.        To\n\ndecide this issue, we must interpret a contract between Sportfolio\n\nand AT&T.    The parties agree that the contract is to be interpreted\n\nunder New Jersey law, but disagree as to how that law should be\n\napplied to this case.        After examining the contract and the\n\napplicable law, we find that AT&T did not improperly withhold money\n\nfrom Sportfolio and affirm the district court's ruling.\n\n                               I.    FACTS\n\n             There are no essential differences between the parties on\n\nthe underlying facts.     Since 1989 Sportfolio has provided sports\n\nprediction information through pay-per-call 900 number programs.\n\nIn September 1989, Sportfolio and AT&T entered into a billing\n\nservices agreement under which AT&T agreed to perform billing and\n\ncollection services in connection with Sportfolio's 900 number\n\nprogram.2    The agreement provided, in part, that \"[y]our customers\n\n('Callers') will be billed for the charges associated with your\n\n\n\n     1\n         We treat appellants as one entity, Sportfolio.\n     2\n      The relevant contract provisions are affixed to this opinion\nas an appendix.\n\n                                    -3-\n\foffer(s).    AT&T will remit collected charges to you, less any loss\n\nindicated in this agreement.\"            The agreement also provided that\n\nAT&T would undertake \"good faith efforts to collect your charges\n\nfrom your callers,\" less any amount which a \"caller disputes or\n\nrefuses to pay.\"\n\n             The agreement between Sportfolio and AT&T further stated\n\nthat AT&T's billing mechanism for its 900 number accounts would\n\ninvolve     AT&T    entering    into   agreements      with       local   telephone\n\ncompanies, which were referred to as local exchange companies\n\n(\"LECs\").     The LEC would track and bill incoming calls to a given\n\n900 number and arrange for collection from the caller.\n\n             The parties also incorporated into their contract the\n\nterms of AT&T's Federal Communications Commission tariff. A clause\n\nin that tariff stated that \"AT&T MultiQuest Service does not\n\nprovide for:       . . . calls originating from coin telephones.\"\n\n             Also   relevant    for    this   appeal     is   a   section   of   the\n\ncontract in which AT&T reserved the right to terminate the contract\n\nimmediately by notice to Sportfolio if AT&T determined, in its sole\n\ndiscretion,    that:      (1)   the    provision    of    billing     services    to\n\nSportfolio adversely affected other AT&T services; (2) Sportfolio's\n\n900 number adversely affected AT&T's public image or goodwill; or\n\n(3) an LEC failed to provide necessary billing services at prices\n\nacceptable to AT&T.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\f            In September 1989, AT&T contracted with NYNEX as the LEC\n\nto provide billing service.         Under the AT&T-NYNEX contract, AT&T\n\ntransmitted to NYNEX records for calls from telephone numbers in\n\nthe New England states.            NYNEX would review the records for\n\n\"unbillable\" calls (e.g., telephone numbers that were no longer in\n\nservice, or where the owner moved without providing a forwarding\n\naddress)    and    then   purge   such    calls   from   the   records.   Once\n\nunbillable calls were removed, NYNEX would purchase the remaining\n\nbillable calls from AT&T for a slight discount based on a formula\n\nwhich included a bad debt allowance for \"uncollectible\" calls\n\n(e.g., customer disputes or refusals to pay), and then bill the\n\ncallers.3\n\n            From the inception of the AT&T-Sportfolio contract in\n\nSeptember 1989 until May 1995, the relationship between the two was\n\nuneventful.       Sportfolio charged callers $25 per call for accessing\n\nthe program, from which AT&T deducted a 10 percent fee.              AT&T made\n\nmonthly payments to Sportfolio based on the number of calls to\n\nSportfolio's 900 number during the prior month.\n\n            In early June 1995, however, AT&T noticed through routine\n\nmonitoring that Sportfolio's 900 number was receiving an unusually\n\n\n\n     3\n      This procedure is somewhat different from what the district\ncourt found -- that the discount took care of unbillable and\nuncollectible calls.    The district court did not mention the\nwinnowing process that NYNEX took prior to its payment to AT&T.\nThis, however, does not affect our reasoning and is immaterial.\n\n\n                                         -5-\n\fhigh volume of short duration calls from telephone numbers assigned\n\nto coin telephones.    Although the actual source of the calls was\n\nnever determined, Sportfolio admitted at oral argument that all the\n\ncalls came from coin telephones.   For the period of June, July and\n\nAugust 1995, over 85,000 short duration calls were placed to\n\nSportfolio's 900 number. In comparison, during February, March and\n\nApril 1995, call records show that calls to Sportfolio's 900\n\nnumbers ranged between four and forty-five calls per month.\n\n            By letter dated June 19, 1995, AT&T informed Sportfolio\n\nthat, pursuant to their agreement, \"AT&T will hold . . . $30,500.00\n\nof your June 1995 funds . . . until an investigation of suspicious\n\ncalls . . . has been completed.\"   When the aberrant calling pattern\n\ncontinued into July and August 1995, AT&T sent similar letters\n\n(holding $645,517.53 of July funds and holding $762,764.63 of\n\nAugust funds).    In September and October 1995, AT&T sent two more\n\nletters to Sportfolio (holding $591,524.97 of September funds and\n\nholding $23,989.76 of October funds).\n\n            On October 12, 1995, AT&T sent a written notice to\n\nSportfolio via overnight delivery, which Sportfolio received the\n\nnext day.    In the notice AT&T stated:\n\n            Pursuant to Sections 7A and 7B of the Billing\n            Services Agreement between AT&T and Sportfolio\n            Publications, AT&T will terminate Premium\n            Billing Services for the above 900 numbers\n            effective immediately.      AT&T has noticed\n            significant calling volume increases and\n            calling pattern changes that appear to\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\f           indicate that the 900 service is being abused\n           in violation of AT&T's tariff.\n\nSportfolio immediately called an AT&T representative to dispute the\n\ntermination,     but   to   no    avail.    Within     six   weeks   of   AT&T's\n\ntermination, Sportfolio set up new 900 numbers and billing services\n\nthrough a different provider.\n\n           On October 10, 1997, Sportfolio filed a three-count\n\ncomplaint against AT&T in Massachusetts Superior Court.               In Count\n\nI, Sportfolio alleged that AT&T breached the terms of the contract\n\nby withholding revenues collected on calls made to Sportfolio's\n\nsports information program.         In Count II, Sportfolio alleged that\n\nAT&T breached the contract when it terminated the agreement without\n\nproper notice or cause.       In Count III, which has not been appealed,\n\nSportfolio alleged that AT&T engaged in unfair and deceptive\n\nbusiness practices in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.\n\n           The    case      was   removed   to   the    District     Court    of\n\nMassachusetts, based on diversity jurisdiction.                 AT&T filed a\n\ncounterclaim that alleged Sportfolio owed AT&T $324,852.72 in\n\ncollection fees for the calls that came from coin telephones.                 On\n\nNovember 13, 2001, the district court issued a lengthy opinion from\n\nthe bench granting AT&T's motion for summary judgment on all three\n\ncounts.    The district court's ruling pertained only to the calls\n\nthat originated from coin telephones and were disputed by the\n\nparties.   The district court did not rule on the amount of money\n\nAT&T owed Sportfolio for the legitimate calls that the parties did\n\n                                      -7-\n\fnot dispute.      The district court reserved for trial an \"accounting\n\nand payment to Sportfolio of the amounts improperly withheld\" for\n\nthose calls.       On February 14, 2002, the district court denied\n\nAT&T's counterclaim.\n\n              On March 13, 2002, AT&T notified the district court that\n\nit    was    prepared   to   pay   Sportfolio    a    sum    of   money   for   the\n\nlegitimate, undisputed telephone calls.              Sportfolio agreed to this\n\nand on March 20, 2002, the district court ordered that AT&T pay\n\nSportfolio the agreed upon sum for the legitimate, undisputed\n\ntelephone calls.        After the parties agreed to settle the claim for\n\nthe undisputed calls for $63,810, the district court entered a\n\nfinal judgment for Sportfolio in that amount on April 16, 2002.\n\nAT&T did not appeal this judgment.          The parties agree that the case\n\nnow before us involves Sportfolio's appeal of the district court's\n\ngrants of summary judgment on its claim involving the disputed\n\ncalls made from coin telephones and its claim that AT&T breached\n\nthe contract by terminating without proper notice or cause.\n\n                                   II. THE LAW\n\n              As already noted, the operative law in the case is that\n\nof New Jersey.      In American Cyanamid Co. v. Fermenta Animal Health\n\nCo., 54 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir. 1995), the Third Circuit quoted from\n\nthe    New     Jersey    Supreme    Court,      which       in    discussing    the\n\ninterpretation of contracts stated, inter alia,:\n\n              The judicial interpretive function is to\n              consider what was written in the context of\n\n                                      -8-\n\f          the circumstances under which it was written,\n          and accord to the language a rational meaning\n          in keeping with the expressed general purpose.\n\n(quoting Atl. N. Airlines, Inc. v. Schwimmer, 96 A.2d 652, 656\n\n(N.J. 1953)).\n\n          The district court, in interpreting the contract under\n\nNew Jersey law, relied heavily on Kaufman v. Provident Life and\n\nCasualty Insurance Co., 828 F. Supp. 275, 282-83 (D.N.J. 1992).\n\nThat court, in an opinion replete with case citations to the\n\ninterpretation of contracts under New Jersey law, held inter alia,\n\nas follows:\n\n          The   appropriateness  of  granting   summary\n          judgment depends upon whether the contract\n          terms at issue in this case are questions of\n          contract     construction     or    contract\n          interpretation.     The construction of an\n          unambiguous term in a contract is exclusively\n          with [] the court. Construction of contracts\n          is a question of law.\n\n          Whether a term is clear or ambiguous is also a\n          question of law. An ambiguity in a contract\n          exists if the terms of the contract are\n          susceptible to at least two reasonable\n          alternative      interpretations.          The\n          interpretation of ambiguous terms in a\n          contract is generally a question of fact.\n\n(citations and quotation marks omitted).   We note the obvious, New\n\nJersey law on the interpretation of contracts is not significantly\n\ndifferent from that of most jurisdictions. See 5 Corbin, Contracts\n\n§ 24.24 (Rev. ed. 1998); Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 206\n\n(1981).\n\n\n\n                               -9-\n\f            Sportfolio strives mightily, as it did in the district\n\ncourt, to convince us that the terms \"callers\" and \"collected\n\ncharges\" are ambiguous and they raise issues of material fact that\n\nshould be decided by a jury.        Sportfolio asserted in Count I that\n\nAT&T breached the terms of the contract by withholding \"collected\n\ncharges\" that AT&T obtained from \"callers.\"          On appeal, Sportfolio\n\nsays that    the   district   court   erred    in   interpreting   the   word\n\n\"callers,\" as that term is used in the contract.                 The parties\n\ndiffer on what \"callers\" means. Sportfolio says that a \"caller\" is\n\nthe person or entity responsible for paying for telephone calls\n\nfrom a given telephone number, regardless of whether that person or\n\nentity actually     placed    the   billable   call.     Thus,   under   this\n\ninterpretation, NYNEX is a \"caller\" because it owned the coin\n\ntelephones from which the disputed phone calls were made.             To the\n\ncontrary, AT&T contends that a \"caller\" is a person or entity who\n\nowns a phone that can be billed and because under the contract coin\n\ntelephones cannot be billed, NYNEX is not a \"caller.\"\n\n            The district court held:\n\n            I find that read as a whole, the contract at\n            issue in this case is not ambiguous with\n            regard to Sportfolio's purported right to\n            payment from AT&T. It clearly provides that\n            Sportfolio is entitled to get a percentage of\n            payments that AT&T collects from customers who\n            are defined in section 1B of the contract as\n            callers.\n\n            Contrary to Sportfolio's contention, it is not\n            entitled to payment for calls which cannot be\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f           billed by AT&T to callers because they came\n           from pay phones or for some other reason.\n\n           We agree with the district court and further rule that\n\nSportfolio's admission at oral argument that the disputed calls\n\ncame from coin telephones bars any recovery by Sportfolio for those\n\ncalls because the contract clearly provides that AT&T is not\n\nresponsible for calls originating from coin telephones. Indeed, in\n\nresponse   to    our   questioning    at    oral   argument,   counsel    for\n\nSportfolio agreed that his claim was that Sportfolio should collect\n\na $25 service charge on all of the approximately 85,000 disputed\n\ncalls made from coin telephones.\n\n           The contract unambiguously provides that AT&T does not\n\npay for calls originating from coin telephones.                The relevant\n\ntariff provision, which is incorporated into the contract by way of\n\nsection 12, states:       \"AT&T MultiQuest Service does not provide\n\nfor:   . . . Calls Originating from Coin Telephones . . . .\"             Thus,\n\nalthough it might be argued that the word \"caller\" is ambiguous,\n\nthis does not make any difference because the contract specifically\n\nstates that AT&T is not responsible for calls originating from coin\n\ntelephones.     In our view, this was the point the district court was\n\nmaking when it stated:     \"[c]ontrary to Sportfolio's contention, it\n\nis not entitled to payment for calls which cannot be billed by AT&T\n\nto callers because they came from pay phones or for some other\n\nreason.\"\n\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f            Because we have ruled that calls from coin telephones\n\ncannot be charged to AT&T under the contract-tariff provisions, it\n\nfollows inevitably that calls from coin telephones were not made by\n\n\"callers\"   as that term is used in the contract.        Under the\n\ncontract, AT&T promised only to \"collect charges\" from \"callers.\"\n\nAT&T is, therefore, not responsible for \"collecting charges\" for\n\ncalls made from coin telephones.   This conclusion means that we do\n\nnot need to address appellants' argument on the ambiguity of\n\n\"collected charges.\"\n\n            There is, however, another issue we must address.\n\nSportfolio claims that AT&T breached the terms of the contract by\n\nterminating the agreement in (1) violation of an implied covenant\n\nof good faith and fair dealing and (2) without proper notice.\n\nSportfolio claims that AT&T acted in bad faith when, during the\n\nthree month investigation, it charged Sportfolio for the service,\n\ni.e., 10 percent of $25, on the disputed calls and then refused to\n\npay Sportfolio the remaining $22.50 for these calls.    Sportfolio\n\nmaintains that AT&T knew the 900 number was being abused but still\n\nallowed the abuse to continue for the purpose of collecting revenue\n\nfrom NYNEX that it did not intend to pay Sportfolio.    In effect,\n\nSportfolio says that AT&T increased its revenue while allowing\n\nSportfolio to be injured.     Sportfolio further argues that AT&T\n\nbreached the contract by not giving advance notice.    AT&T, on the\n\nother hand, argues that the unusual volume and pattern of the\n\n\n                               -12-\n\faberrant calls constituted proper grounds for AT&T to exercise its\n\nright to terminate the agreement \"immediately by notice to you.\"\n\n          The termination provision of the contract states:\n\n          7.          TERMINATION\n\n                      A.   AT&T   reserves     the    right    to\n                           terminate    this     Agreement     or\n                           billing for any offer(s) provided\n                           under this Agreement immediately\n                           by   notice    to    you,    if   AT&T\n                           determines,       in     its      sole\n                           discretion,     that    (1)     AT&T's\n                           tariffed services may be adversely\n                           affected by the offer(s) or the\n                           provision of Billing Services\n                           under this Agreement, (2) that the\n                           offer(s) or the provision of\n                           Billing Services may adversely\n                           affect AT&T's public image or\n                           damage    AT&T's     reputation     or\n                           goodwill, or (3) in any geographic\n                           area served by a LEC where such\n                           LEC fails to provide any necessary\n                           billing     services      at     rates\n                           acceptable to AT&T.\n\n(emphasis added).\n\n             We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nas to these two issues.         AT&T's termination of the contract was\n\nproper because the contract explicitly states that AT&T reserves\n\nthe right to terminate the agreement immediately, if it determined,\n\nin its sole discretion, that its services, public image or goodwill\n\nwere adversely affected. We agree with the district court that the\n\nsuspicious    calls    gave   AT&T   a   reasonable   basis   upon   which   to\n\nterminate the agreement. In addition, AT&T gave adequate notice of\n\nthe termination.       AT&T mailed a written notice of the contract\n\n                                     -13-\n\ftermination on the same day that it terminated the contract.              The\n\nnotice   was   sent   via   overnight   delivery   and   was   received    by\n\nSportfolio the next day.      The agreement simply required that AT&T\n\ngive notice; AT&T was not required to give advance notice.\n\n           In regard to the implied covenant of good faith and fair\n\ndealing, Sportfolio never raised this argument in the district\n\ncourt.   This argument will not be considered on appeal because\n\n\"[t]he law in this circuit is crystalline: a litigant's failure to\n\nexplicitly raise an issue before the district court forecloses that\n\nparty from raising the issue for the first time on appeal.\"         Boston\n\nBeer Co.

BILLING SERVICES\n\n                 A.   Acting as your agent, AT&T will\n                      perform the following services\n                      associated with your offer(s):\n                      secure usage records; message\n                      processing; bill processing; bill\n                      rendering, inquiry, and collection\n                      and remittance services.\n\n                 B.   Your customers (\"Callers\") will be\n                      billed for the charges associated\n                      with your offer(s).     AT&T will\n                      remit collected charges to you,\n                      less any fees as indicated in this\n                      Agreement.\n\n                 C.   To the extent necessary, AT&T's\n                      undertaking will include good\n                      faith efforts to secure billing\n                      services   from   Local   Exchange\n                      Companies (LECs) where the same\n                      arrangements for billing of AT&T\n                      services are provided by the LECs\n                      to AT&T.      This Agreement is\n                      expressly contingent upon AT&T's\n                      ability   to    secure   necessary\n                      Billing Services, if any, from the\n                      LECs.\n\n\n          2.     CALLER INQUIRY AND ADJUSTMENTS\n\n                 A.   AT&T will undertake good faith\n                      efforts to collect your charges\n                      from your Callers. However, AT&T\n                      may remove from a Caller's bill\n                      any amounts associated with the\n                      offer(s) which the Caller disputes\n                      or refuses to pay.\n\n                 B.   Where amounts have been removed\n                      from a Caller's bill, you will\n                      remain obligated to AT&T and will\n\n                              -15-\n\f          be billed by AT&T for AT&T's\n          billing fee for the call, and for\n          the transmission charges and any\n          related AT&T charges for Network\n          Service (network services and\n          service    features)     actually\n          provided in connection with the\n          call.\n\n3.   CHARGES/REMITTANCE\n\n     A. Within 60 days after the month in\n     which the calls were made to Customer's\n     Program(s),   AT&T   shall   remit   to\n     Customer the net amount of Customer's\n     charges for the billing period provided\n     that AT&T may delay payment for up to\n     90 days a) based on the results of\n     credit checks obtained by AT&T under\n     Section 20 of the Agreement, or b) if\n     the Customer is being transitioned from\n     a 90 day payout. Notwithstanding the\n     above, AT&T may continue to delay all\n     or a portion of payment in accordance\n     with Section 19 of the Agreement.] The\n     Net Amount shall be calculated by\n     subtracting the following amounts from\n     the charges collected.\n\n               [ . . . ]\n\n     1.   Charges  for   Network  Services\n          provided in connection with your\n          offer;\n\n     2.   Any   amounts  which   have  been\n          removed from callers' bills as a\n          result of a dispute or refusal to\n          pay;\n\n     3.   Any federal,     state,   and   local\n          taxes . . .;\n\n     4.   AT&T billing service fee. The AT&T\n          MultiQuest   Interacter   and   AT&T\n          MultiQuest HICAP billing fee is 10%\n          of your charge to callers for each\n          call made during the billing period.\n\n                  -16-\n\f                     [ . . .]\n\n6.     TELEPHONE NUMBER CHANGES\n\nYou have no ownership or other interest in the\ntelephone number(s) assigned to you in\nconnection with AT&T's provision of Billing\nServices, and AT&T reserves the right to\nchange    such   numbers(s)   whenever    AT&T\ndetermines that such change is necessary to\neffectively    provide    Billing    Services,\nincluding but not limited to a change in the\noffer(s) or a change in your charges for the\noffer(s). Upon termination of this Agreement,\nAT&T will assign you a different telephone\nnumber(s) if you elect to continue Network\nServices.\n\n7.     TERMINATION\n\n       A.   AT&T   reserves     the    right    to\n            terminate    this     Agreement     or\n            billing for any offer(s) provided\n            under this Agreement immediately\n            by   notice    to    you,    if   AT&T\n            determines,       in     its      sole\n            discretion,     that    (1)     AT&T's\n            tariffed services may be adversely\n            affected by the offer(s) or the\n            provision of Billing Services\n            under this Agreement, (2) that the\n            offer(s) or the provision of\n            Billing Services may adversely\n            affect AT&T's public image or\n            damage    AT&T's     reputation     or\n            goodwill, or (3) in any geographic\n            area served by a LEC where such\n            LEC fails to provide any necessary\n            billing     services      at     rates\n            acceptable to AT&T.\n\n       B.   If you breach any provision of this\n            agreement, of if AT&T receives any\n            complaints   regarding    your   AT&T\n            MultiQuest interacter/AT&T MultiQuest\n            HICAP/AT&T   MultiQuest   Broadcaster\n            and/or   Card    Counter    messages,\n\n                       -17-\n\f            representations,        promotions,\n            advertising, products or services, or\n            if any claims are made against AT&T\n            arising from them, then AT&T may\n            immediately terminate this Agreement\n            and all Billing Services rendered\n            under it. In addition, on receipt of\n            any claim or complaint, against you\n            in connection with its use of AT&T's\n            Billing Services, the parties agree\n            that AT&T may deposit all amounts\n            then or thereafter due to you in an\n            escrow account pending the resolution\n            of all such claims and complaints.\n\nC.          Either   party   may    terminate   the\n            Agreement without cause at least thirty\n            (30) days prior written notice to the\n            other party specifying the exact date\n            and time of such termination.\n\n                  [ . . . ]\n\n12.    TARIFFED SERVICES\n\nYour subscription to Network Services is\nsubject to any and all tariff provisions\nrelated to such Network Services, to the\nextent the services are tariffed.         This\nAgreement does not govern or affect tariffed\nservices.   Where anything in this Agreement\nconflicts with any tariff governing the\nprovision of Network Services, the tariff\nshall apply.    Charges under this Agreement\nwill not be abated or refunded in the event of\noutages or degradation in tariffed services,\nand charges for tariffed services will not be\nabated or refunded in the event of delay or\nfailure of performance of this Agreement.\n\n                  [ . . . ]\n\n14.    LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY\n\n                  [ . . . ]\n\n       C.

(\"Sportfolio\") and Andrew P. Buckley, its owner and manager, from a summary judgment issued by the district court in favor of defendant-appellee, AT &amp; T Corporation (\"AT &amp; T\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The main issue in this case is whether AT &amp; T improperly withheld monies due to Sportfolio. To decide this issue, we must interpret a contract between Sportfolio and AT &amp; T. The parties agree that the contract is to be interpreted under New Jersey law, but disagree as to how that law should be applied to this case. After examining the contract and the applicable law, we find that AT &amp; T did not improperly withhold money from Sportfolio and affirm the district court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are no essential differences between the parties on the underlying facts. Since 1989 Sportfolio has provided sports prediction information through pay-percall 900 number programs. In September 1989, Sportfolio and AT &amp; T entered into a billing services agreement under which AT &amp; T agreed to perform billing and collection services in connection with Sportfolio's 900 number program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The agreement provided, in part, that \"[y]our customers (`Callers') will be billed for the charges associated with your offer(s). AT &amp; T will remit collected charges to you, less any loss indicated in this agreement.\" The agreement also provided that AT &amp; T would undertake \"good faith efforts to collect your charges from your callers,\" less any amount which a \"caller disputes or refuses to pay.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement between Sportfolio and AT &amp; T further stated that AT &amp; T's billing mechanism for its 900 number accounts would involve AT &amp; T entering into agreements with local telephone companies, which were referred to as local exchange companies (\"LECs\"). The LEC would track and bill incoming calls to a given 900 number and arrange for collection from the caller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties also incorporated into their contract the terms of AT &amp; T's Federal Communications Commission tariff. A clause in that tariff stated that \"AT &amp; T MultiQuest Service does not provide for:... calls originating from coin telephones.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also relevant for this appeal is a section of the contract in which AT &amp; T reserved the right to terminate the contract immediately by notice to Sportfolio if AT &amp; T determined, in its sole discretion, that: (1) the provision of billing services to Sportfolio adversely affected other AT &amp; T services; (2) Sportfolio's 900 number adversely affected AT &amp; T's public image or goodwill; or (3) an LEC failed to provide necessary billing services at prices acceptable to AT &amp; T.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1989, AT &amp; T contracted with NYNEX as the LEC to provide billing service. Under the AT &amp; T-NYNEX contract, AT &amp; T transmitted to NYNEX records for calls from telephone numbers in the New England states. NYNEX would review the records for \"unbillable\" calls (e.g., telephone numbers that were no longer in service, or where the owner moved without providing a forwarding address) and then purge such calls from the records. Once unbillable calls were removed, NYNEX would purchase the remaining billable calls from AT &amp; T for a slight discount based on a formula which included a bad debt allowance for \"uncollectible\" calls (e.g., customer disputes or refusals to pay), and then bill the callers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the inception of the AT &amp; T-Sportfolio contract in September 1989 until May 1995, the relationship between the two was uneventful. Sportfolio charged callers $25 per call for accessing the program, from which AT &amp; T deducted a 10 percent fee. AT &amp; T made monthly payments to Sportfolio based on the number of calls to Sportfolio's 900 number during the prior month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early June 1995, however, AT &amp; T noticed through routine monitoring that Sportfolio's 900 number was receiving an unusually high volume of short duration calls from telephone numbers assigned to coin telephones. Although the actual source of the calls was never determined, Sportfolio admitted at oral argument that all the calls came from coin telephones. For the period of June, July and August 1995, over 85,000 short duration calls were placed to Sportfolio's 900 number. In comparison, during February, March and April 1995, call records show that calls to Sportfolio's 900 numbers ranged between four and forty-five calls per month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By letter dated June 19, 1995, AT &amp; T informed Sportfolio that, pursuant to their agreement, \"AT &amp; T will hold ... $30,500.00 of your June 1995 funds ... until an investigation of suspicious calls ... has been completed.\" When the aberrant calling pattern continued into July and August 1995, AT &amp; T sent similar letters (holding $645,517.53 of July funds and holding $762,764.63 of August funds). In September and October 1995, AT &amp; T sent two more letters to Sportfolio (holding $591,524.97 of September funds and holding $23,989.76 of October funds).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 12, 1995, AT &amp; T sent a written notice to Sportfolio via overnight delivery, which Sportfolio received the next day. In the notice AT &amp; T stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to Sections 7A and 7B of the Billing Services Agreement between AT &amp; T and Sportfolio Publications, AT &amp; T will terminate Premium Billing Services for the above 900 numbers effective immediately. AT &amp; T has noticed significant calling volume increases and calling pattern changes that appear to indicate that the 900 service is being abused in violation of AT &amp; T's tariff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sportfolio immediately called an AT &amp; T representative to dispute the termination, but to no avail. Within six weeks of AT &amp; T's termination, Sportfolio set up new 900 numbers and billing services through a different provider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 10, 1997, Sportfolio filed a three-count complaint against AT &amp; T in Massachusetts Superior Court. In Count I, Sportfolio alleged that AT &amp; T breached the terms of the contract by withholding revenues collected on calls made to Sportfolio's sports information program. In Count II, Sportfolio alleged that AT &amp; T breached the contract when it terminated the agreement without proper notice or cause. In Count III, which has not been appealed, Sportfolio alleged that AT &amp; T engaged in unfair and deceptive business practices in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was removed to the District Court of Massachusetts, based on diversity jurisdiction. AT &amp; T filed a counterclaim that alleged Sportfolio owed AT &amp; T $324,852.72 in collection fees for the calls that came from coin telephones. On November 13, 2001, the district court issued a lengthy opinion from the bench granting AT &amp; T's motion for summary judgment on all three counts. The district court's ruling pertained only to the calls that originated from coin telephones and were disputed by the parties. The district court did not rule on the amount of money AT &amp; T owed Sportfolio for the legitimate calls that the parties did not dispute. The district court reserved for trial an \"accounting and payment to Sportfolio of the amounts improperly withheld\" for those calls. On February 14, 2002, the district court denied AT &amp; T's counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 13, 2002, AT &amp; T notified the district court that it was prepared to pay Sportfolio a sum of money for the legitimate, undisputed telephone calls. Sportfolio agreed to this and on March 20, 2002, the district court ordered that AT &amp; T pay Sportfolio the agreed upon sum for the legitimate, undisputed telephone calls. After the parties agreed to settle the claim for the undisputed calls for $63,810, the district court entered a final judgment for Sportfolio in that amount on April 16, 2002. AT &amp; T did not appeal this judgment. The parties agree that the case now before us involves Sportfolio's appeal of the district court's grants of summary judgment on its claim involving the disputed calls made from coin telephones and its claim that AT &amp; T breached the contract by terminating without proper notice or cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE LAW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already noted, the operative law in the case is that of New Jersey. In <i>American Cyanamid Co. v. Fermenta Animal</i> <i>Health Co.,</i> 54 F.3d 177, 181 (3d Cir.1995), the Third Circuit quoted from the New Jersey Supreme Court, which in discussing the interpretation of contracts stated, <i>inter alia,:</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The judicial interpretive function is to consider what was written in the context of the circumstances under which it was written, and accord to the language a rational meaning in keeping with the expressed general purpose.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(quoting <i>Atl. N. Airlines, Inc. v. Schwimmer,</i> 12 N.J. 293, 96 A.2d 652, 656 (N.J. 1953)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, in interpreting the contract under New Jersey law, relied heavily on <i>Kaufman v. Provident Life and Casualty Insurance Co.,</i> 828 F.Supp. 275, 282-83 (D.N.J.1992). That court, in an opinion replete with case citations to the interpretation of contracts under New Jersey law, held <i>inter alia,</i> as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appropriateness of granting summary judgment depends upon whether the contract terms at issue in this case are questions of contract construction or contract interpretation. The construction of an unambiguous term in a contract is exclusively with [] the court. Construction of contracts is a question of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a term is clear or ambiguous is also a question of law. An ambiguity in a contract exists if the terms of the contract are susceptible to at least two reasonable alternative interpretations. The interpretation of ambiguous terms in a contract is generally a question of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(citations and quotation marks omitted). We note the obvious, New Jersey law on the interpretation of contracts is not significantly different from that of most jurisdictions. <i>See</i> 5 Corbin, <i>Contracts</i> &#167; 24.24 (Rev. ed.1998); Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 206 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sportfolio strives mightily, as it did in the district court, to convince us that the terms \"callers\" and \"collected charges\" are ambiguous and they raise issues of material fact that should be decided by a jury. Sportfolio asserted in Count I that AT &amp; T breached the terms of the contract by withholding \"collected charges\" that AT &amp; T obtained from \"callers.\" On appeal, Sportfolio says that the district court erred in interpreting the word \"callers,\" as that term is used in the contract. The parties differ on what \"callers\" means. Sportfolio says that a \"caller\" is the person or entity responsible for paying for telephone calls from a given telephone number, regardless of whether that person or entity actually placed the billable call. Thus, under this interpretation, NYNEX is a \"caller\" because it owned the coin telephones from which the disputed phone calls were made. To the contrary, AT &amp; T contends that a \"caller\" is a person or entity who owns a phone that can be billed and because under the contract coin telephones cannot be billed, NYNEX is not a \"caller.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The district court held:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find that read as a whole, the contract at issue in this case is not ambiguous with regard to Sportfolio's purported right to payment from AT &amp; T. It clearly provides that Sportfolio is entitled to get a percentage of payments that AT &amp; T collects from customers who are defined in section 1B of the contract as callers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Sportfolio's contention, it is not entitled to payment for calls which cannot be billed by AT &amp; T to callers because they came from pay phones or for some other reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court and further rule that Sportfolio's admission at oral argument that the disputed calls came from coin telephones bars any recovery by Sportfolio for those calls because the contract clearly provides that AT &amp; T is not responsible for calls originating from coin telephones. Indeed, in response to our questioning at oral argument, counsel for Sportfolio agreed that his claim was that Sportfolio should collect a $25 service charge on all of the approximately 85,000 disputed calls made from coin telephones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contract unambiguously provides that AT &amp; T does not pay for calls originating from coin telephones. The relevant tariff provision, which is incorporated into the contract by way of section 12, states: \"AT &amp; T MultiQuest Service does not provide for: ... Calls Originating from Coin Telephones....\" Thus, although it might be argued that the word \"caller\" is ambiguous, this does not make any difference because the contract specifically states that AT &amp; T is not responsible for calls originating from coin telephones. In our view, this was the point the district court was making when it stated: \"[c]ontrary to Sportfolio's contention, it is not entitled to payment for calls which cannot be billed by AT &amp; T to callers because they came from pay phones or for some other reason.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we have ruled that calls from coin telephones cannot be charged to AT &amp; T under the contract-tariff provisions, it follows inevitably that calls from coin telephones were not made by \"callers\" as that term is used in the contract. Under the contract, AT &amp; T promised only to \"collect charges\" from \"callers.\" AT &amp; T is, therefore, not responsible for \"collecting charges\" for calls made from coin telephones. This conclusion means that we do not need to address appellants' argument on the ambiguity of \"collected charges.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, however, another issue we must address. Sportfolio claims that AT &amp; T breached the terms of the contract by terminating the agreement in (1) violation of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and (2) without proper notice. Sportfolio claims that AT &amp; T acted in bad faith when, during the three month investigation, it charged Sportfolio for the service, i.e., 10 percent of $25, on the disputed calls and then refused to pay Sportfolio the remaining $22.50 for these calls. Sportfolio maintains that AT &amp; T knew the 900 number was being abused but still allowed the abuse to continue for the purpose of collecting revenue from NYNEX that it did not intend to pay Sportfolio. In effect, Sportfolio says that AT &amp; T increased its revenue while allowing Sportfolio to be injured. Sportfolio further argues that AT &amp; T breached the contract by not giving advance notice. AT &amp; T, on the other hand, argues that the unusual volume and pattern of the aberrant calls constituted proper grounds for AT &amp; T to exercise its right to terminate the agreement \"immediately by notice to you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The termination provision of the contract states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">7. TERMINATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>AT &amp; T reserves the right to terminate this Agreement or billing for any offer(s) provided under this Agreement immediately by notice to you, if AT &amp; T determines, in its sole discretion, that (1) AT &amp; T's tariffed services may be adversely affected by the offer(s) or the provision of Billing Services under this Agreement,</i> (2) that the offer(s) or the provision of Billing Services may adversely affect AT &amp; T's public image or damage AT &amp; T's reputation or goodwill, or (3) in any geographic area served by a LEC where such LEC fails to provide any necessary billing services at rates acceptable to AT &amp; T.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment as to these two issues. AT &amp; T's termination of the contract was proper because the contract explicitly states that AT &amp; T reserves the right to terminate the agreement immediately, if it determined, <i>in its sole discretion,</i> that its services, public image or goodwill were adversely affected. We agree with the district court that the suspicious calls gave AT &amp; T a reasonable basis upon which to terminate the agreement. In addition, AT &amp; T gave adequate notice of the termination. AT &amp; T mailed a written notice of the contract termination on the same day that it terminated the contract. The notice was sent via overnight delivery and was received by Sportfolio the next day. The agreement simply required that AT &amp; T give notice; AT &amp; T was not required to give advance notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In regard to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, Sportfolio never raised this argument in the district court. This argument will not be considered on appeal because \"[t]he law in this circuit is crystalline: a litigant's failure to explicitly raise an issue before the district court forecloses that party from raising the issue for the first time on appeal.\" <i>Boston Beer Co.

(\"Sportfolio\") and Andrew P. Buckley, its owner and manager, from a summary judgment issued by the district court in favor of defendant-appellee, AT &amp; T Corporation (\"AT &amp; T\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The main issue in this case is whether AT &amp; T improperly withheld monies due to Sportfolio. To decide this issue, we must interpret a contract between Sportfolio and AT &amp; T. The parties agree that the contract is to be interpreted under New Jersey law, but disagree as to how that law should be applied to this case. After examining the contract and the applicable law, we find that AT &amp; T did not improperly withhold money from Sportfolio and affirm the district court's ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. FACTS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are no essential differences between the parties on the underlying facts. Since 1989 Sportfolio has provided sports prediction information through pay-percall 900 number programs. In September 1989, Sportfolio and AT &amp; T entered into a billing services agreement under which AT &amp; T agreed to perform billing and collection services in connection with Sportfolio's 900 number program.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> The agreement provided, in part, that \"[y]our customers (`Callers') will be billed for the charges associated with your offer(s). AT &amp; T will remit collected charges to you, less any loss indicated in this agreement.\" The agreement also provided that AT &amp; T would undertake \"good faith efforts to collect your charges from your callers,\" less any amount which a \"caller disputes or refuses to pay.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agreement between Sportfolio and AT &amp; T further stated that AT &amp; T's billing mechanism for its 900 number accounts would involve AT &amp; T entering into agreements with local telephone companies, which were referred to as local exchange companies (\"LECs\"). The LEC would track and bill incoming calls to a given 900 number and arrange for collection from the caller.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties also incorporated into their contract the terms of AT &amp; T's Federal Communications Commission tariff. A clause in that tariff stated that \"AT &amp; T MultiQuest Service does not provide for:... calls originating from coin telephones.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Also relevant for this appeal is a section of the contract in which AT &amp; T reserved the right to terminate the contract immediately by notice to Sportfolio if AT &amp; T determined, in its sole discretion, that: (1) the provision of billing services to Sportfolio adversely affected other AT &amp; T services; (2) Sportfolio's 900 number adversely affected AT &amp; T's public image or goodwill; or (3) an LEC failed to provide necessary billing services at prices acceptable to AT &amp; T.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 1989, AT &amp; T contracted with NYNEX as the LEC to provide billing service. Under the AT &amp; T-NYNEX contract, AT &amp; T transmitted to NYNEX records for calls from telephone numbers in the New England states. NYNEX would review the records for \"unbillable\" calls (e.g., telephone numbers that were no longer in service, or where the owner moved without providing a forwarding address) and then purge such calls from the records. Once unbillable calls were removed, NYNEX would purchase the remaining billable calls from AT &amp; T for a slight discount based on a formula which included a bad debt allowance for \"uncollectible\" calls (e.g., customer disputes or refusals to pay), and then bill the callers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">From the inception of the AT &amp; T-Sportfolio contract in September 1989 until May 1995, the relationship between the two was uneventful. Sportfolio charged callers $25 per call for accessing the program, from which AT &amp; T deducted a 10 percent fee. AT &amp; T made monthly payments to Sportfolio based on the number of calls to Sportfolio's 900 number during the prior month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In early June 1995, however, AT &amp; T noticed through routine monitoring that Sportfolio's 900 number was receiving an unusually high volume of short duration calls from telephone numbers assigned to coin telephones. Although the actual source of the calls was never determined, Sportfolio admitted at oral argument that all the calls came from coin telephones. For the period of June, July and August 1995, over 85,000 short duration calls were placed to Sportfolio's 900 number. In comparison, during February, March and April 1995, call records show that calls to Sportfolio's 900 numbers ranged between four and forty-five calls per month.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By letter dated June 19, 1995, AT &amp; T informed Sportfolio that, pursuant to their agreement, \"AT &amp; T will hold ... $30,500.00 of your June 1995 funds ... until an investigation of suspicious calls ... has been completed.\" When the aberrant calling pattern continued into July and August 1995, AT &amp; T sent similar letters (holding $645,517.53 of July funds and holding $762,764.63 of August funds). In September and October 1995, AT &amp; T sent two more letters to Sportfolio (holding $591,524.97 of September funds and holding $23,989.76 of October funds).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 12, 1995, AT &amp; T sent a written notice to Sportfolio via overnight delivery, which Sportfolio received the next day. In the notice AT &amp; T stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to Sections 7A and 7B of the Billing Services Agreement between AT &amp; T and Sportfolio Publications, AT &amp; T will terminate Premium Billing Services for the above 900 numbers effective immediately. AT &amp; T has noticed significant calling volume increases and calling pattern changes that appear to indicate that the 900 service is being abused in violation of AT &amp; T's tariff.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sportfolio immediately called an AT &amp; T representative to dispute the termination, but to no avail. Within six weeks of AT &amp; T's termination, Sportfolio set up new 900 numbers and billing services through a different provider.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 10, 1997, Sportfolio filed a three-count complaint against AT &amp; T in Massachusetts Superior Court. In Count I, Sportfolio alleged that AT &amp; T breached the terms of the contract by withholding revenues collected on calls made to Sportfolio's sports information program. In Count II, Sportfolio alleged that AT &amp; T breached the contract when it terminated the agreement without proper notice or cause. In Count III, which has not been appealed, Sportfolio alleged that AT &amp; T engaged in unfair and deceptive business practices in violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The case was removed to the District Court of Massachusetts, based on diversity jurisdiction. AT &amp; T filed a counterclaim that alleged Sportfolio owed AT &amp; T $324,852.72 in collection fees for the calls that came from coin telephones. On November 13, 2001, the district court issued a lengthy opinion from the bench granting AT &amp; T's motion for summary judgment on all three counts. The district court's ruling pertained only to the calls that originated from coin telephones and were disputed by the parties. The district court did not rule on the amount of money AT &amp; T owed Sportfolio for the legitimate calls that the parties did not dispute. The district court reserved for trial an \"accounting and payment to Sportfolio of the amounts improperly withheld\" for those calls. On February 14, 2002, the district court denied AT &amp; T's counterclaim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 13, 2002, AT &amp; T notified the district court that it was prepared to pay Sportfolio a sum of money for the legitimate, undisputed telephone calls. Sportfolio agreed to this and on March 20, 2002, the district court ordered that AT &amp; T pay Sportfolio the agreed upon sum for the legitimate, undisputed telephone calls. After the parties agreed to settle the claim for the undisputed calls for $63,810, the district court entered a final judgment for Sportfolio in that amount on April 16, 2002. AT &amp; T did not appeal this judgment. The parties agree that the case now before us involves Sportfolio's appeal of the district court's grants of summary judgment on its claim involving the disputed calls made from coin telephones and its claim that AT &amp; T breached the contract by terminating without proper notice or cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. THE LAW</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As already noted, the operative law in the case is that of New Jersey.

Provident Life and Casualty Insurance Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2351875\"><a href=\"/opinion/2351875/kaufman-v-provident-life-and-cas-ins-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">828</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">275</span></a></span>, 282-83 (D.N.J.1992). That court, in an opinion replete with case citations to the interpretation of contracts under New Jersey law, held <i>inter alia,</i> as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appropriateness of granting summary judgment depends upon whether the contract terms at issue in this case are questions of contract construction or contract interpretation. The construction of an unambiguous term in a contract is exclusively with [] the court. Construction of contracts is a question of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a term is clear or ambiguous is also a question of law. An ambiguity in a contract exists if the terms of the contract are susceptible to at least two reasonable alternative interpretations. The interpretation of ambiguous terms in a contract is generally a question of fact.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(citations and quotation marks omitted). We note the obvious, New Jersey law on the interpretation of contracts is not significantly different from that of most jurisdictions. <i>See</i> 5 Corbin, <i>Contracts</i> &#167; 24.24 (Rev. ed.1998); Restatement (Second) of Contracts &#167; 206 (1981).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sportfolio strives mightily, as it did in the district court, to convince us that the terms \"callers\" and \"collected charges\" are ambiguous and they raise issues of material fact that should be decided by a jury. Sportfolio asserted in Count I that AT &amp; T breached the terms of the contract by withholding \"collected charges\" that AT &amp; T obtained from \"callers.\" On appeal, Sportfolio says that the district court erred in interpreting the word \"callers,\" as that term is used in the contract. The parties differ on what \"callers\" means. Sportfolio says that a \"caller\" is the person or entity responsible for paying for telephone calls from a given telephone number, regardless of whether that person or entity actually placed the billable call. Thus, under this interpretation, NYNEX is a \"caller\" because it owned the coin telephones from which the disputed phone calls were made. To the contrary, AT &amp; T contends that a \"caller\" is a person or entity who owns a phone that can be billed and because under the contract coin telephones cannot be billed, NYNEX is not a \"caller.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">The district court held:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I find that read as a whole, the contract at issue in this case is not ambiguous with regard to Sportfolio's purported right to payment from AT &amp; T. It clearly provides that Sportfolio is entitled to get a percentage of payments that AT &amp; T collects from customers who are defined in section 1B of the contract as callers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to Sportfolio's contention, it is not entitled to payment for calls which cannot be billed by AT &amp; T to callers because they came from pay phones or for some other reason.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with the district court and further rule that Sportfolio's admission at oral argument that the disputed calls came from coin telephones bars any recovery by Sportfolio for those calls because the contract clearly provides that AT &amp; T is not responsible for calls originating from coin telephones. Indeed, in response to our questioning at oral argument, counsel for Sportfolio agreed that his claim was that Sportfolio should collect a $25 service charge on all of the approximately 85,000 disputed calls made from coin telephones.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The contract unambiguously provides that AT &amp; T does not pay for calls originating from coin telephones. The relevant tariff provision, which is incorporated into the contract by way of section 12, states: \"AT &amp; T MultiQuest Service does not provide for: ... Calls Originating from Coin Telephones....\" Thus, although it might be argued that the word \"caller\" is ambiguous, this does not make any difference because the contract specifically states that AT &amp; T is not responsible for calls originating from coin telephones. In our view, this was the point the district court was making when it stated: \"[c]ontrary to Sportfolio's contention, it is not entitled to payment for calls which cannot be billed by AT &amp; T to callers because they came from pay phones or for some other reason.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because we have ruled that calls from coin telephones cannot be charged to AT &amp; T under the contract-tariff provisions, it follows inevitably that calls from coin telephones were not made by \"callers\" as that term is used in the contract. Under the contract, AT &amp; T promised only to \"collect charges\" from \"callers.\" AT &amp; T is, therefore, not responsible for \"collecting charges\" for calls made from coin telephones. This conclusion means that we do not need to address appellants' argument on the ambiguity of \"collected charges.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is, however, another issue we must address. Sportfolio claims that AT &amp; T breached the terms of the contract by terminating the agreement in (1) violation of an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and (2) without proper notice. Sportfolio claims that AT &amp; T acted in bad faith when, during the three month investigation, it charged Sportfolio for the service, i.e., 10 percent of $25, on the disputed calls and then refused to pay Sportfolio the remaining $22.50 for these calls. Sportfolio maintains that AT &amp; T knew the 900 number was being abused but still allowed the abuse to continue for the purpose of collecting revenue from NYNEX that it did not intend to pay Sportfolio. In effect, Sportfolio says that AT &amp; T increased its revenue while allowing Sportfolio to be injured. Sportfolio further argues that AT &amp; T breached the contract by not giving advance notice. AT &amp; T, on the other hand, argues that the unusual volume and pattern of the aberrant calls constituted proper grounds for AT &amp; T to exercise its right to terminate the agreement \"immediately by notice to you.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The termination provision of the contract states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">7. TERMINATION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>AT &amp; T reserves the right to terminate this Agreement or billing for any offer(s) provided under this Agreement immediately by notice to you, if AT &amp; T determines, in its sole discretion, that (1) AT &amp; T's tariffed services may be adversely affected by the offer(s) or the provision of Billing Services under this Agreement,</i> (2) that the offer(s) or the provision of Billing Services may adversely affect AT &amp; T's public image or damage AT &amp; T's reputation or goodwill, or (3) in any geographic area served by a LEC where such LEC fails to provide any necessary billing services at rates acceptable to AT &amp; T.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment as to these two issues. AT &amp; T's termination of the contract was proper because the contract explicitly states that AT &amp; T reserves the right to terminate the agreement immediately, if it determined, <i>in its sole discretion,</i> that its services, public image or goodwill were adversely affected. We agree with the district court that the suspicious calls gave AT &amp; T a reasonable basis upon which to terminate the agreement. In addition, AT &amp; T gave adequate notice of the termination. AT &amp; T mailed a written notice of the contract termination on the same day that it terminated the contract. The notice was sent via overnight delivery and was received by Sportfolio the next day. The agreement simply required that AT &amp; T give notice; AT &amp; T was not required to give advance notice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In regard to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, Sportfolio never raised this argument in the district court. This argument will not be considered on appeal because \"[t]he law in this circuit is crystalline: a litigant's failure to explicitly raise an issue before the district court forecloses that party from raising the issue for the first time on appeal.\" <i>Boston Beer Co.
