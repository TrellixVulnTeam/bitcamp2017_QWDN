Carlos    Barros-Villahermosa\n\n(\"Barros\") appeals from an order granting summary judgment in favor\n\nof the United States on his malicious prosecution claim brought\n\nunder the Federal Tort Claims Act (\"FTCA\").      We affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND1\n\n           In 2004, Barros was a U.S. Customs and Border Patrol\n\nofficer assigned to Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San\n\nJuan, Puerto Rico.    One day after work, Barros passed by a local\n\npolice vehicle, which appeared to be junked, in the vicinity of the\n\nairport.   He entered the vehicle and removed a permit decal that\n\ngave the holder access to secured areas within the airport.         He\n\ntook the decal home and shredded it, without reporting the incident\n\nto his superiors.\n\n           Unbeknownst to Barros, the area was under surveillance by\n\nthe Puerto Rico Police Department (\"PRPD\").      The police arrested\n\nBarros and, in concert with local prosecutors, charged him with\n\nmisappropriation under the Puerto Rico Penal Code.            The PRPD\n\nnotified the Department of Homeland Security (\"DHS\") of the arrest.\n\nBecause Barros was already under federal investigation for employee\n\nmisconduct, DHS sent an agent from its Office of Inspector General\n\n-- Reynaldo Sánchez-Ruíz (\"Sánchez\"), a defendant in this case --\n\nto observe and report on the PRPD's investigation.       Sánchez was\n\n      1\n      We recount the facts in the light most favorable to Barros as\nthe party opposing summary judgment. Harriman v. Hancock County,\n627 F.3d 22, 25 (1st Cir. 2010).\n\n                                  -2-\n\fpresent when the police interviewed Barros, although Sánchez did\n\nnot ask any questions.   Sánchez was not present, however, when the\n\nprosecutor interviewed Barros later that day.\n\n            A preliminary court hearing held in November 2004 ended\n\nin a finding of no probable cause.     Sánchez attended the hearing\n\nbut remained in the audience gallery and did not participate.   The\n\nprosecutor requested a rehearing, which was held two weeks later.\n\nAt the rehearing, Sánchez took up position immediately behind the\n\nprosecutor yet still in the audience gallery.       After a witness\n\nfinished testifying, Sánchez leaned over the bar and whispered into\n\nthe prosecutor's ear.2    The judge told Sánchez to stop talking.\n\nThat hearing too resulted in a finding of no probable cause, and\n\nthe case against Barros was dismissed.3\n\n            In 2005, DHS issued a Report of Investigation (\"ROI\") on\n\nBarros.     The record version of the ROI is a two-page excerpt of\n\nwhat appears to be a six-page document that appended multiple\n\nexhibits.    Much of the excerpt is redacted, including the name of\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      The summary judgment record before us does not reveal what\nSánchez said to the prosecutor. When asked at oral argument, the\ngovernment responded that, at his deposition, Sánchez testified\nthat he said something like \"that was a good witness.\"\n     3\n      For a general description of this procedure in Puerto Rico,\nsee El Vocero de Puerto Rico (Caribbean Int'l News Corp.) v. Puerto\nRico, 508 U.S. 147, 148 (1993).\n\n                                 -3-\n\fthe \"Reporting Agent.\"         The portions that are not redacted recount\n\nthe PRPD's investigation, described above.4\n\n              In 2006, Barros initiated the present action against the\n\nUnited States and others.            He asserted numerous state and federal\n\nclaims, most of which met their demise below and were not appealed.\n\nThe   only    remaining      claim   is   that    the    United   States,   through\n\nSánchez, maliciously prosecuted Barros. After the government moved\n\nfor summary judgment on that claim, the district court referred the\n\nmotion to a magistrate judge, who issued a report recommending that\n\nsummary      judgment   be    granted     in    the    government's   favor.   The\n\ndistrict court adopted in full the magistrate judge's report and\n\nrecommendation and entered judgment.                  This appeal followed.\n\nII.   DISCUSSION\n\n              Our review of the summary judgment grant is de novo.\n\nRivera-Marcano v. Normeat Royal Dane Quality A/S, 998 F.2d 34, 37\n\n(1st Cir. 1993).        \"To demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue\n\nof material fact, plaintiffs must point to concrete, admissible\n\nevidence.\"      Id.     \"Mere allegations, or conjecture unsupported in\n\nthe record, are insufficient.\"             Id.\n\n              Barros brought this claim under the FTCA, so we look to\n\nthe law of Puerto Rico for the governing standards.                   See Gonzalez\n\nRucci v. U.S. Immigration & Naturalization Serv., 405 F.3d 45, 49\n\n\n      4\n      The record does not reflect what action, if any, took place\nas a result of the ROI.\n\n                                          -4-\n\f(1st Cir. 2005) (\"Under the FTCA, we look to the 'law of the place'\n\nwhere the alleged wrongful actions occurred\" (quoting Rodriguez v.\n\nUnited States, 54 F.3d 41, 44 (1st Cir. 1995))).         To succeed on a\n\nclaim for malicious prosecution in Puerto Rico, the claimant must\n\nprove four elements:     \"1) that a criminal action was initiated or\n\ninstigated    by   the   defendants;   2)   that   the   criminal   action\n\nterminated in favor of plaintiff; 3) that defendants acted with\n\nmalice and without probable cause;[5] and 4) that plaintiff suffered\n\ndamages.\"    Id. (internal brackets omitted).      Failure to prove any\n\nelement is dispositive.     See id.\n\n            We agree with the district court that Barros has failed\n\nto meet his summary judgment burden.        To \"initiate or instigate\" a\n\ncriminal action, a defendant must be \"actively instrumental in the\n\ninitiation of the prosecution through some affirmative action by\n\nway of advice, petition, encouragement or pressure.\"                Rivera-\n\nMarcano, 998 F.2d at 37 (translating Jiménez v. Sánchez, 76 D.P.R.\n\n370 (1954)).       There is no evidence that Sánchez's involvement\n\nsatisfies that definition.     Rather, the record is quite clear that\n\nthe PRPD arrested and then brought charges against Barros in\n\nconjunction with local prosecutors.          Sánchez was present at an\n\ninterview and attended hearings, but did so as an observer and at\n\n\n\n     5\n      We have described this element as \"two separate elements\nbecause plaintiffs must show both that the defendant acted with\nmalice and that he acted without probable cause.\" Rivera-Marcano,\n998 F.2d at 37.\n\n                                   -5-\n\fthe invitation of the PRPD.        Barros points to the ROI, but even\n\nwere we to assume that Sánchez was the author -- which Barros does\n\nnot substantiate -- the ROI could not possibly have contributed to\n\nthe decision to prosecute Barros:         it was issued more than a year\n\nafter the charges against Barros were brought.6\n\n           In any event, Barros has not shown that Sánchez acted\n\nwith malice.    For purposes of malicious prosecution, Puerto Rico\n\ncourts equate malice with bad faith.       See Raldiris v. Levitt & Sons\n\nof Puerto Rico, Inc., 3 P.R. Offic. Trans. 1087 (1975) (\"It is\n\nnecessary that there be a malicious imputation, made in bad faith\n\n. . .\"); see also Vyas Sangidas v. Holiday Inns, Inc., 660 F. Supp.\n\n666, 668 (D.P.R. 1987) (construing Puerto Rico law).             Here, we\n\ndiscern no evidence that remotely suggests bad faith.              Barros\n\nclaims   that   Sánchez   should   have    been   disqualified   from   the\n\ninvestigation because they knew each other from a previous job.\n\n\n\n     6\n      Barros argues, in cursory fashion, that Puerto Rico law\nrequires an adverse presumption against the government for\n\"willfully suppressing\" parts of the ROI. See Texaco Puerto Rico,\nInc. v. Medina, 834 F.2d 242, 244 (1st Cir. 1987) (discussing\nPuerto Rico Rule of Evidence 16(5)). We do not reach the argument\nbecause Barros neither adequately developed it on appeal, United\nStates v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990) (\"issues adverted\nto in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by some effort at\ndeveloped argumentation, are deemed waived\"), nor objected on that\nbasis to the magistrate judge's report and recommendation, Sch.\nUnion No. 37 v. United Nat'l Ins. Co., 617 F.3d 554, 564 (1st Cir.\n2010) (\"We have previously held that 'only those issues fairly\nraised by the objections to the magistrate's report are subject to\nreview in the district court and those not preserved by such\nobjection[s] are precluded on appeal.'\" (quoting Keating v. Sec'y\nof Health & Human Servs., 848 F.2d 271, 275 (1st Cir. 1988))).\n\n                                   -6-\n\fBut Barros has not established that disqualification was required\n\nunder the circumstances, and the existence of a possible recusal\n\nissue   is   hardly   indicative   of   bad   faith.   Moreover,   at   his\n\ndeposition, Barros acknowledged that there was no \"bad blood\"\n\nbetween them.\n\n             Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -7-\n\f",

He asserted numerous state and federal claims, most of which met their demise below and were not appealed. The only remaining claim is that the United States, through Sánchez, maliciously prosecuted Barros. After the government moved for summary judgment on that claim, the district court referred the motion to a magistrate judge, who issued a report recommending that summary judgment be granted in the government's favor. The district court adopted in full the magistrate judge's report and recommendation and entered judgment. This appeal followed.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. DISCUSSION</h2>\n<p>Our review of the summary judgment grant is de novo. <i>Rivera-Marcano v. Normeat Royal Dane Quality A/S,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610898\"><a href=\"/opinion/610898/jose-a-rivera-marcano-v-normeat-royal-dane-quality-as-formerly/\"><span class=\"volume\">998</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">34</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.1993). \"To demonstrate the existence of a genuine issue of material fact, plaintiffs must point to concrete, admissible evidence.\" <i>Id.</i> \"Mere allegations, or conjecture unsupported in the record, are insufficient.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n<p>Barros brought this claim under the FTCA, so we look to the law of Puerto Rico for the governing standards. <i>See </i><i>Gonzalez Rucci v. U.S. Immigration &amp; Naturalization Serv.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201548\"><a href=\"/opinion/201548/gonzalez-rucci-v-us-immigration/\"><span class=\"volume\">405</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 49 (1st Cir.2005) (\"Under the FTCA, we look to the `law of the place' where the alleged wrongful actions occurred\" (quoting <i>Rodriguez v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"695513\"><a href=\"/opinion/695513/manuela-rodriguez-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">41</span></a></span>, 44 (1st Cir.1995))). To succeed on a claim for malicious prosecution in Puerto Rico, the claimant must prove four elements: \"1) that a criminal action was initiated or instigated by the defendants; 2) that the criminal action terminated in favor of plaintiff; 3) that defendants acted with malice and without probable cause;<sup>[5]</sup> and 4) that plaintiff suffered damages.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal brackets omitted). Failure to prove any element is dispositive. <i>See id.</i></p>\n<p>We agree with the district court that Barros has failed to meet his summary judgment burden. To \"initiate or instigate\" a criminal action, a defendant must be \"actively instrumental in the initiation of the prosecution through some affirmative action by way of advice, petition, encouragement or pressure.\" <i>Rivera-Marcano,</i> 998 F.2d at 37 (translating <i>Jiménez v. Sánchez,</i> 76 D.P.R. 370 (1954)). There is no evidence that Sánchez's involvement satisfies that definition. Rather, the record is quite clear that the PRPD arrested and then brought charges against Barros in conjunction with local prosecutors. Sánchez was present at an interview and attended hearings, but did so as an observer and at the invitation of the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*59</span> PRPD. Barros points to the ROI, but even were we to assume that Sánchez was the authorwhich Barros does not substantiate the ROI could not possibly have contributed to the decision to prosecute Barros: it was issued more than a year <i>after</i> the charges against Barros were brought.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>In any event, Barros has not shown that Sánchez acted with malice. For purposes of malicious prosecution, Puerto Rico courts equate malice with bad faith. <i>See Raldiris v. Levitt &amp; Sons of Puerto Rico, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">3</span> <span class=\"reporter\">P.R. Offic. Trans.</span> <span class=\"page\">1087</span></span>, 103 D.P.R. 778 (1975) (\"It is necessary that there be a malicious imputation, made in bad faith . . .\"); <i>see also </i><i>Vyas Sangidas v. Holiday Inns, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">660</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">666</span></span>, 668 (D.P.R.1987) (construing Puerto Rico law). Here, we discern no evidence that remotely suggests bad faith. Barros claims that Sánchez should have been disqualified from the investigation because they knew each other from a previous job. But Barros has not established that disqualification was required under the circumstances, and the existence of a possible recusal issue is hardly indicative of bad faith. Moreover, at his deposition, Barros acknowledged that there was no \"bad blood\" between them.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Sixth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  We recount the facts in the light most favorable to Barros as the party opposing summary judgment. <i>Harriman v.

When asked at oral argument, the government responded that, at his deposition, Sánchez testified that he said something like \"that was a good witness.\"</p>\n<p>[3]  For a general description of this procedure in Puerto Rico, see <i>El Vocero de Puerto Rico (Caribbean Int'l News Corp.) v.
