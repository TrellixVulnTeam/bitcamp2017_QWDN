This consolidated appeal of two\n\ncriminal cases, Appeal Nos. 01-2386 and 01-2397, requires us to\n\nevaluate the validity of certain conditions of supervised release\n\nand   the   procedures      used   to   impose       those   conditions.    This\n\nevaluation,    in   turn,    requires     us    to    consider   the   amount   of\n\ndiscretion a sentencing court may delegate to probation officers\n\nand whether a condition that is included in a written sentencing\n\norder but not announced at the sentencing hearing violates a\n\ndefendant's constitutional rights.\n\n                                        I.\n\n            In Appeal No. 01-2386, the defendant, Rafael Meléndez-\n\nSantana (\"Meléndez\"), and three other individuals met an undercover\n\nDEA agent and a police informant on August 21, 2000, in a shopping\n\nmall parking lot to purchase twenty-five kilograms of cocaine. The\n\nparties had previously negotiated a sales price of $12,000 per\n\nkilogram for a total of $300,000.             Meléndez agreed to finance this\n\npurchase.   When Meléndez opened the trunk of his car and showed the\n\npurported sellers a portion of the money, DEA agents arrested him\n\nand his associates.          They found a Beretta 9mm pistol in his\n\npossession.\n\n            In Appeal No. 01-2397, Meléndez committed the crimes\n\napproximately three months prior to his arrest on the charges\n\ninvolved in Appeal No. 01-2386. The details regarding this earlier\n\nconduct as reported in the parties' stipulated statement of facts\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fare sparse.    It appears that Meléndez dropped an individual off at\n\nthe airport who was carrying $36,000 in a bag.          A search of the van\n\nthat Meléndez was driving produced approximately a kilogram of\n\ncocaine, approximately five hundred (500) grams of heroin and\n\nseveral weapons.       The    stipulated    statement   of   facts   did   not\n\nindicate why Meléndez was not arrested at the airport on that day.\n\n          On September 21, 2000, a federal grand jury in Puerto\n\nRico indicted Meléndez on four counts for the August 21 conduct.\n\nThe indictment included one count of possession with intent to\n\ndistribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, possession of a\n\nfirearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, possession of\n\na firearm by a convicted felon, and aiding and abetting.             Meléndez\n\npled guilty to the drug possession and possession of a firearm in\n\nfurtherance of a drug trafficking offense counts on January 23,\n\n2001.   On August 21, 2001, the district court sentenced him to a\n\nterm of twenty-four months on the first charge and sixty months on\n\nthe second.    The terms were to be served consecutively.             He was\n\nalso sentenced to three years of supervised release.\n\n          At    the   end    of   that   sentencing   hearing,   Meléndez's\n\nattorney advised the court that an information had been filed\n\nagainst Meléndez in Appeal No. 01-2397, the case involving the\n\nearlier criminal conduct at the airport.                In that case, the\n\ngovernment accused him of possession with intent to distribute one\n\nkilogram of cocaine and approximately five hundred grams of heroin.\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fMeléndez waived his right to indictment and the preparation of a\n\nPre-Sentence Report (PSR) and pled guilty.          In exchange for his\n\nplea, the parties agreed that he would be held accountable for more\n\nthan four hundred grams but less than five hundred grams of\n\ncocaine.   He was sentenced during the same hearing to a term of\n\nthirty-seven months of imprisonment, to be served consecutively to\n\nthe sentence in Appeal No. 01-2386.         He was also sentenced to a\n\nsupervised release term of four years.\n\n           Meléndez   filed   a   timely   appeal   from   his   sentences,\n\nraising a series of challenges to the length of his sentence and to\n\nthe terms of his supervised release.       After a careful review of the\n\nrecord, we affirm part of his sentences, vacate other portions and\n\nremand for re-sentencing by the district court.\n\n                                   II.\n\n           We begin our analysis with some background information on\n\nthe supervised release system.        Congress abolished the existing\n\nparole system in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, § 212(a)(2), 98\n\nStat. 1999 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3583 (2000)), and replaced it\n\nwith a new system of \"supervised release.\"          The two systems are\n\nsimilar in that both allow former inmates to reenter society under\n\nofficial control.      However, under supervised release, courts,\n\nrather than the Parole Commission, are responsible for setting and\n\nenforcing the conditions of release.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f           The United States Sentencing Guidelines generally require\n\ncourts to impose a term of supervised release to follow every\n\nfelony--or when otherwise required by statute--and they give the\n\ncourts the option to do so in all other cases.           U.S.S.G. § 5D1.1.\n\nThese terms normally last one to five years.         Id. § 5D1.2(a).\n\n           The Guidelines list a series of conditions of supervised\n\nrelease that fall into three categories: 1) mandatory conditions\n\nthat courts must include in every sentencing order; 2) standard\n\nconditions that are recommended but not required; and 3) special\n\nconditions that are not required but can be imposed under certain\n\ncircumstances.    U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3.       The seven mandatory conditions\n\ninclude basic correctional provisions such as \"the defendant shall\n\nnot   commit   another   federal,   state   or   local   offense,\"   id.   §\n\n5D1.3(a)(1), and \"the defendant shall not unlawfully possess a\n\ncontrolled substance,\" id. § 5D1.3(a)(2).          The fifteen standard\n\nconditions generally relate to the defendant's responsibilities\n\ntoward his probation officer. See, e.g., id. § 5D1.3(c)(3) (\"[T]he\n\ndefendant shall answer truthfully all inquiries by the probation\n\nofficer and follow the instructions of the probation officer.\").\n\nThey also include rehabilitative requirements, such as a condition\n\nmandating that the defendant keep a job.         Id. § 5D1.3(c)(5).\n\n           In addition to the mandatory and standard conditions,\n\nthere are twelve \"special\" conditions listed in Sections 5D1.3(d)\n\nand 5D1.3(e) of the Guidelines. Section 5D1.3(d) consists of seven\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fspecial conditions that are recommended in situations in which\n\ncertain predicate facts are present.               For example, one provision\n\nbars defendants        who    have   been    convicted     of   felonies   or    used\n\ndangerous weapons in the course of their crimes from possessing a\n\nfirearm or other dangerous weapon.                 Id. § 5D1.3(d)(1).           Other\n\nprovisions mandate that the defendants participate in drug and\n\nmental health treatment programs when the court finds that such\n\ntreatment is necessary.           Id. § 5D1.3(d).         Section 5D1.3(e) lists\n\nadditional      special      conditions     that   \"may   be    appropriate     on   a\n\ncase-by-case basis.\"          These special conditions include a curfew,\n\nhome       detention   and    community     service    requirements.          Id.    §\n\n5D1.3(e).1\n\n               If a released inmate violates the terms of supervised\n\nrelease, the court may impose serious punishments, up to and\n\nincluding requiring the violator to serve his release term in\n\nprison. 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(3). Under certain circumstances, such\n\nas where the defendant possesses illegal drugs or refuses to comply\n\n\n       1\n      In addition to the listed conditions, courts can also impose\nconditions \"to the extent that such conditions (1) are reasonably\nrelated to (A) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the\nhistory and characteristics of the defendant; (B) the need for the\nsentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct;\n(C) the need to protect the public from further crimes of the\ndefendant; and (D) the need to provide the defendant with needed\neducational or vocational training, medical care, or other\ncorrectional treatment in the most effective manner; and (2)\ninvolve no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably\nnecessary for the purposes set forth above and are consistent with\nany pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing\nCommission.\" U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(b).\n\n                                          -6-\n\fwith drug testing requirements, the court must revoke his term of\n\nsupervised release and reimprison him.       18 U.S.C. § 3583(g).         We\n\nturn now to Meléndez's specific claims.\n\nA.         Four Year Supervised Release Term\n\n           Meléndez claims--and the government agrees--that the\n\ndistrict   court   erroneously   departed   from    the    United    States\n\nSentencing   Guidelines   when   it   sentenced    him    to   a   four-year\n\nsupervised release term in Appeal No. 01-2397, the case involving\n\nthe information and the earlier criminal conduct.          We concur.2\n\n           Before a court may impose a sentence exceeding the\n\nGuidelines, it \"must give prior notice to the defendant of its\n\nintention to impose a term of such an extended duration and must\n\nstate on the record the aggravating circumstances that justify the\n\nupward departure.\"    United States v. Matos       328 F.3d 34, 44 (1st\n\nCir. 2003); see also Burns v. United States, 501 U.S. 129, 138-39\n\n(1991).    The government charged Meléndez in an information with\n\n\n     2\n      Meléndez did not object to this departure at sentencing. In\nUnited States v. Cortes-Claudio, 312 F.3d 17, 24 (1st Cir. 2002),\nwe held that while we generally review for plain error when a party\nfails to object at sentencing, we apply abuse of discretion review\n\"if the defendant could not reasonably have anticipated the issue\nwould arise until after the court ruled.\" Since Cortes-Claudio\ncould not reasonably have anticipated that the court would depart\nfrom the guidelines, we reviewed that sentence for abuse of\ndiscretion. Id. The same reasoning applies here. In practical\nterms, however, the distinction between the two standards of review\nis irrelevant to the outcome of this case since we would reach the\nsame result under plain error review. See, e.g., United States v.\nMangone, 105 F.3d 29, 36 (1st Cir. 1997) (finding plain error when\nthe sentencing court departed upward without giving prior notice).\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fpossession with intent to distribute one kilogram of cocaine and\n\n500 grams of heroin in Appeal No. 01-2397.                   Meléndez waived\n\nindictment, trial, and the preparation of a Pre-sentence Report and\n\nagreed to plead guilty.          Under the terms of that plea agreement,\n\nhowever, the parties stipulated that he would plead guilty to\n\npossession with the intent to distribute at least four hundred but\n\nless than five hundred grams of cocaine.\n\n               The original offense for which Meléndez was charged in\n\nthe information carried a mandatory four-year term of supervised\n\nrelease, see 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B), but the offense to which he\n\nactually pled guilty only carried a statutory mandatory term of\n\nthree years of supervised release.          21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(C).    The\n\nsentencing court erroneously imposed the supervised release term\n\nthat       accompanied   the   original   charge.3   Since    the   resulting\n\nsentence exceeded the Guidelines for the offense for which he\n\nactually was found guilty, see U.S.S.G. § 5D1.2(a), and since the\n\ncourt failed to provide advance notice of this departure, we vacate\n\nthe four-year supervised release provision in Appeal No. 01-2397.\n\nWe also vacate the portion of the judgment that states that\n\n\n       3\n      Our view that this was merely an oversight is supported by\nthe thirty-seven month term of imprisonment that the court ordered.\nThe offense level with which the sentencing judge started matches\nthe Guidelines level for a crime involving four hundred but less\nthan five hundred grams of cocaine but it is below the mandatory\nminimum sentence for crimes involving five hundred grams or more of\ncocaine. See 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B) (setting a mandatory minimum\nprison sentence of five years for crimes involving five hundred\ngrams but less than five kilograms of cocaine).\n\n                                      -8-\n\fMeléndez pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute one\n\nkilogram of cocaine and five hundred grams of heroin.                     As noted,\n\nMeléndez    actually   pled    guilty      to     possession      with    intent   to\n\ndistribute   four   hundred     but   less       than   five   hundred     grams   of\n\ncocaine, and the judgment should be corrected to reflect this\n\nfact.4\n\nB.          Consecutive Sentences\n\n            Meléndez   claims    that      the    district     court     erroneously\n\nordered him to serve the sentences in Appeal Nos. 01-2386 and 01-\n\n2397 consecutively.       In    his    view,      the     convictions     should   be\n\nconsidered    multiple   counts       of   the     same    case   for     sentencing\n\npurposes.     He contends that the offenses all involved similar\n\nconduct, that these offenses occurred only three months apart, that\n\nhe was not arrested until after he had taken the actions underlying\n\nthe charges in both cases, and that both cases were disposed of on\n\nthe same day in the same proceeding.             On this basis, he argues that\n\nhis sentences should run concurrently.                    See U.S.S.G. § 5G1.2;\n\nUnited States v. Quiñones, 26 F.3d 213, 217 (1st Cir. 1994)\n\n\n     4\n      The sentencing court allowed the defendant to waive the\npreparation of a separate PSR for this hearing. A report had been\nprepared in the proceedings giving rise to Appeal No. 01-2386, and\ndefense counsel claimed that a new PSR was unnecessary.\nNevertheless, the Guidelines clearly state in a policy statement\nthat \"[t]he defendant may not waive preparation of the presentence\nreport,\" U.S.S.G. § 6A1.1. The errors here illustrate the wisdom\nof that requirement.   With a PSR in hand, the court would have\nrecognized that the circumstances of the plea did not permit a\nfour-year supervised release term, and would have entered a\njudgment that accurately reflected the terms of this plea.\n\n                                       -9-\n\f(holding    that   a   court   may   impose    consecutive       sentences   for\n\nmultiple-count cases only after following the accepted protocol for\n\nguideline departures).\n\n            The government asserts that Meléndez has waived this\n\nclaim by failing to present it first to the district court.                   It\n\nalso contends that, in any event, there was no plain error.                 As it\n\nnotes, the court simply followed the parties' recommendation in\n\ntheir plea agreement by imposing a consecutive sentence in the\n\nsecond case after first securing Meléndez's confirmation that he\n\nhad agreed to the consecutive sentence.5\n\n            Although Meléndez acknowledges that he agreed to the\n\nconsecutive sentence, he contends that the plea agreement also\n\nstated that he would be sentenced in accordance with the Sentencing\n\nGuidelines and that the sentencing recommendation was in conflict\n\nwith the Guidelines.      Without case law or other support, he argues\n\nthat we should resolve the conflict in favor of the Guidelines.\n\n            On these facts, we agree that Meléndez has waived his\n\nclaim.     We also agree that there was no plain error.             The record\n\nshows that Meléndez entered into his plea agreement voluntarily and\n\nknowingly,    realizing    full      well    that   he   would    receive    the\n\nconsecutive sentence that he did. In effect, Meléndez is asking us\n\n\n\n     5\n      The agreement stated explicitly that \"the appropriate\ndisposition\" of the case was a thirty-seven month term of\nimprisonment \"to be served consecutively with the sentence imposed\nin [Appeal No. 01-2386].\" (emphasis in original).\n\n                                      -10-\n\fto relieve him of his obligations under the plea agreement, even\n\nthough the government has lived up to its commitments.          We decline\n\nto do so.\n\nC.          Conditions of Supervised Release\n\n            Meléndez claims that the district court's imposition of\n\nconditions of supervised release included a number of procedural\n\nand substantive errors.         Specifically, he claims that the court\n\nviolated his Sixth Amendment right to be present at his sentencing\n\nby including a special drug treatment condition in the written\n\nsentencing    orders   without     announcing    that   condition   at   the\n\nsentencing hearings.       He also claims that the drug treatment\n\nprovision    constituted   an    impermissible   delegation   of    judicial\n\nauthority since it allowed a probation officer to determine whether\n\nhe had to undergo treatment.       He claims that a provision requiring\n\nhim to undergo drug testing also constituted an impermissible\n\ndelegation since it allowed the probation officer to decide how\n\nmany drug tests he had to undergo.         Finally, he claims that the\n\ncourt abused its discretion by requiring him to provide financial\n\nrecords to the probation officer, and again violated his Sixth\n\nAmendment rights by not imposing that financial records condition\n\nat one of his hearings.     We will review each claim in turn.\n\n1.   The Drug Treatment Condition\n\n             Meléndez claims that the sentencing court impermissibly\n\ndelegated its sentencing authority by allowing a probation officer\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fto decide whether he might have to attend drug treatment.               The\n\ncondition states that if Meléndez tests positive for drugs, \"at the\n\ndiscretion of the probation officer, [he shall] participate in a\n\nsubstance abuse treatment program arranged and approved by the\n\nprobation officer until duly discharged by authorized program\n\npersonnel with the approval of the probation officer.\"             He also\n\nclaims that since that condition was only included in the written\n\norders setting forth the terms of supervised release but was never\n\nimposed as   a   condition   at   his   sentencing   hearing,    the   court\n\nviolated his Sixth Amendment right to be present at sentencing.\n\na.   The Right to be Present at the Sentencing Hearing\n\n           Defendants have a right, guaranteed by the United States\n\nConstitution and the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to be\n\npresent during sentencing.        See Fed. R. Crim. P. 43(a) (\"[T]he\n\ndefendant must be present at . . . sentencing.\").               The Supreme\n\nCourt has stated that the constitutional aspect of this right is\n\n\"rooted to a large extent in the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth\n\nAmendment,\" but that it also derives from the Fifth Amendment's Due\n\nProcess Clause. United States v. Gagnon, 470 U.S. 522, 526 (1985).\n\nAlthough a defendant does not have a right to be present at every\n\nminor stage in a trial, due process concerns are implicated\n\n          [w]henever [the defendant's] presence has a\n          relation, reasonably substantial, to the\n          fulness of his opportunity to defend against\n          the charge. . . . [T]he presence of a\n          defendant is a condition of due process to the\n          extent that a fair and just hearing would be\n\n                                   -12-\n\f             thwarted by his absence, and to that extent\n             only.\n\nId. (quoting Snyder v. Massachusetts, 291 U.S. 97, 105-06, 108\n\n(1934)).     Since    the defendant's absence from a sentencing hearing\n\ncould threaten his ability to obtain a fair and just hearing on the\n\nimportant issues of punishment and rehabilitation addressed at such\n\na hearing, the Court's due process concerns in Gagnon are relevant\n\nto the sentencing stage of a trial.        See Thompson v. United States,\n\n495 F.2d 1304, 1306 (1st Cir. 1974) (\"[T]he alleged failure of\n\npetitioner to be present at his own sentencing is an error which\n\n.   .   .   affects   seriously   the   fairness,   integrity   and   public\n\nreputation of judicial proceedings.\").\n\n             As a consequence of the defendant's right to be present\n\nat the sentencing hearing, we have previously stated, in dicta,\n\nthat \"'[w]here . . . [a] district court's oral expression of its\n\nsentencing rationale varies materially from its subsequent written\n\nexpression of that rationale, appellate courts have tended to honor\n\nthe former at the expense of the latter.'\"          United States v.

Nearly all of the\n\nother circuits have reached similar conclusions, although there has\n\nbeen some variation in the exact phrasing of this doctrine.            See,\n\ne.g., United States v.

Accordingly, we conclude that where\n\nthe conditions of supervised release announced at the sentencing\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fhearing    conflict    in   a    material   way    with   the    conditions    of\n\nsupervised release in the written sentencing order, the oral\n\nconditions control.\n\n            The failure of the sentencing court to announce the drug\n\ntreatment condition at the sentencing hearing created a material\n\nconflict between the written and oral sentencing orders. The court\n\nimposed a potentially significant new burden on the Defendant--\n\npermitting a probation officer to order him to attend a residential\n\ntreatment program if he failed a drug test--without giving him the\n\nopportunity to object to the condition at the sentencing hearing.\n\nThis    procedure     violated    Meléndez's      right   to    be   present   at\n\nsentencing.     We must vacate the drug treatment condition on this\n\nbasis alone.\n\nb.     Delegation\n\n             There is another defect in the drug treatment condition\n\nthat we must discuss to avoid future problems.                       That defect\n\ninvolves the amount of discretion that the court delegated to the\n\nprobation officer to decide whether Meléndez must participate in a\n\ndrug treatment program.\n\n             Article III of the Constitution vests responsibility for\n\nresolving cases and controversies with the courts.                    As Justice\n\nKennedy observed during his tenure on the Ninth Circuit, this\n\nresponsibility requires \"both the appearance and the reality of\n\ncontrol by Article III judges over the interpretation, declaration,\n\n\n                                     -15-\n\fand   application   of   federal    law\"    to   maintain   \"the   essential,\n\nconstitutional role of the judiciary.\" Pacemaker Diagnostic Clinic\n\nof America, Inc. v. Instromedix, Inc., 725 F.2d 537, 544 (9th Cir.\n\n1984) (Kennedy, J.).       The judiciary's \"essential role\" can be\n\neroded just as easily through improvident delegation as through\n\ninterference by another branch, id.; therefore, separation of\n\npowers    forbids   courts    from     delegating     their    Article    III\n\nresponsibilities.        However,    \"'[t]hat     general   principle    does\n\nnot . . . prohibit courts from using nonjudicial officers to\n\nsupport judicial functions, as long as that judicial officer\n\nretains and exercises ultimate responsibility.'\"            United States v.\n\nAllen, 312 F.3d 512, 515-16 (1st Cir. 2002) (quoting United States\n\nv. Johnson, 48 F.3d 806, 809 (4th Cir. 1995)).\n\n           In Allen, we upheld the sentencing court's imposition of\n\na condition of supervised release that required the defendant to\n\nparticipate in a mental health treatment program \"as directed by\n\nthe probation officer.\"      Allen, 312 F.3d at 515.          We determined\n\nthat the court itself retained ultimate sentencing authority by\n\nrequiring the defendant to undergo treatment and that it had merely\n\ndelegated \"administrative details\" to the probation officer.              Id.\n\nat 516.   In reaching this holding, we contrasted the facts in Allen\n\nwith those in United States v. Kent, 209 F.3d 1073 (8th Cir. 2000),\n\nin which the court struck down a condition that allowed the\n\nprobation officer to make the ultimate decision regarding whether\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\fthe defendant would have to undergo treatment.       Stated simply, the\n\nprobation officer in Allen was not deciding whether the defendant\n\nhad to attend counseling but how many sessions he had to attend.\n\nSee also United States v. Peterson, 248 F.3d 79, 84-85 (2d Cir.\n\n2001) (concluding that delegation would be permissible regarding\n\nscheduling and selection of mental health therapy sessions).\n\n           The   sentencing   court's   delegation   to   the   probation\n\nofficer of the treatment decision in this case contravenes our\n\nruling in Allen.     The drug treatment condition states that if\n\nMeléndez fails a drug test, he must participate in a treatment\n\nprogram \"at the discretion of the probation officer.\"       Rather than\n\nsimply vesting the probation officer with the responsibility for\n\nmanaging the administrative details of drug treatment, the court\n\ngranted the probation officer the authority to decide whether\n\nMeléndez would have to undergo treatment after testing positive for\n\ndrugs.6   That treatment decision must be made by the court, either\n\nat the time of sentencing,7 or later in response to a motion by the\n\n\n     6\n      We consider the determination of the type of program the\ndefendant must enroll in and when he may be discharged to be\nadministrative details that may be delegated to the probation\nofficer.\n     7\n      The United States Sentencing Commission treats the imposition\nof drug treatment as a special condition of supervised release to\nbe imposed by the court. See U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(d)(4) (\"If the court\nhas reason to believe that the defendant is an abuser of narcotics,\nother controlled substances or alcohol--[it may include] a\ncondition requiring the defendant to participate in a program\napproved by the United States Probation Office for substance abuse\n. . . .\").\n\n                                 -17-\n\fprobation officer, citing the positive drug test during the period\n\nof supervised release and seeking a change in the conditions of\n\nsupervised release.8\n\n2.   The Drug Testing Requirement\n\n           Meléndez claims that the district court impermissibly\n\ndelegated its authority to a probation officer when it allowed the\n\nofficer to decide how many drug tests he would be required to\n\nundergo.   Since he failed to object to this aspect of his sentence\n\nbelow, we review for plain error.      Allen, 312 F.3d at 514.9\n\na.   The Terms of the Order\n\n           The oral and written orders in these appeals conflict\n\nregarding the amount of discretion the court delegated to the\n\nprobation officer.     The written sentencing orders in both cases\n\nstated: \"The defendant shall refrain from any unlawful use of a\n\ncontrolled substance and shall submit to one drug test within 15\n\n\n     8\n      Rule 32.1 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure outlines\nthe steps that a probation officer must take to move for the\nmodification of a defendant's terms of supervised release following\na suspected violation.    In pertinent part, the rule grants the\ndefendant the right to a hearing before a magistrate judge to\ndetermine if there is probable cause to believe that he violated\nthe terms of supervised release, Fed. R. Crim. P. 32.1(a) & (b), as\nwell as the right to a hearing before a court to determine whether\nhis terms of supervised release should be modified. Fed. R. Crim.\nP. 32.1(c).\n      9\n      The government and the defendant both framed the issue on\nappeal as whether the district court impermissibly delegated the\ndetermination as to the timing and number of drug tests. Neither\nparty, however, addressed the timing issue.        Accordingly, we\naddress only the issue of whether the court impermissibly delegated\nthe determination of the number of drug tests.\n\n                                -18-\n\fdays of release on supervised release and at least two (2) periodic\n\ndrug tests thereafter, when so requested by the U.S. Probation\n\nOfficer.\"   The oral orders did not include the provision requiring\n\n\"at least two (2) periodic drug tests therafter.\"               The oral order\n\nin Appeal No. 01-2386 stated:              \"The defendant shall refrain from\n\nany unlawful use of controlled substances and shall submit to drug\n\ntesting   within    15   days   of   release      on   supervised    release   and\n\nthereafter whenever so required by the probation officer.\"                     The\n\noral order in 01-2397 was virtually identical. Therefore, pursuant\n\nto the written orders, the probation officer had to require at\n\nleast two additional drug tests after the initial drug test within\n\nfifteen days of release; however, under the oral orders, the\n\nprobation officer could forego any additional drug tests after the\n\ninitial test.      Although there is a conflict between the oral and\n\nwritten orders as to the number of drug tests required, we do not\n\nhave to decide if this is a material conflict requiring a ruling\n\nthat the oral order controls.         See supra Section II.C.1.a.        That is\n\nso because both the oral and written orders suffer from the same\n\ndelegation infirmity.\n\nb.   Delegation\n\n            Both   a     statute     and    the   United    States    Sentencing\n\nGuidelines require the sentencing court to order that the defendant\n\n\"refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance and submit\n\nto a drug test within 15 days of release on supervised release and\n\n\n                                       -19-\n\fat least 2 periodic drug tests thereafter (as determined by the\n\ncourt) for use of a controlled substance.\"          18 U.S.C. § 3583(d)\n\n(2000); U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(a)(4) (emphasis added).10           The court may\n\nonly waive this requirement \"if the defendant's presentence report\n\nor other reliable sentencing information indicates a low risk of\n\nfuture substance abuse by the defendant.\"       18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(5);\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(a)(4).     Meléndez claims that the inclusion of the\n\nwords \"as determined by the court\" means that the court, not the\n\nprobation officer, must decide how many tests a defendant should be\n\nforced to undergo.\n\n            As noted, both the statute and the Guidelines state that\n\nfollowing the initial \"drug test within 15 days of release,\" there\n\nmust be \"at least 2 periodic drug tests thereafter (as determined\n\nby the court) for use of a controlled substance.\"              18 U.S.C. §\n\n3583(d) (2000); U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(a)(4).        If there is any ambiguity\n\nin this text, it does not relate to the responsibility of the court\n\nto   make   the   determination   referenced   in   the    statute.   That\n\nresponsibility could not be more explicit.                But what is the\n\ndetermination that the court must make? The determination assigned\n\nto the court could either be the time frame for the two periodic\n\ndrug tests mandated by the statute, or the number of additional\n\n\n\n      10\n      The Guideline provision refers to release on \"probation\"\ninstead of on \"supervised release\"; however, the provision is\nlocated in Section 5D1.3, which explicitly governs \"Conditions of\nSupervised Release.\"\n\n                                   -20-\n\fdrug tests to be required beyond the initial drug test within 15\n\ndays of release and the two periodic tests required by the statute.\n\nAs a matter of language, the phrase \"at least\" establishes a\n\nminimum and implies that a maximum remains to be determined.                    As a\n\nmatter of common sense, we do not think that Congress would require\n\ncourts   to    become      involved   in    the   scheduling   of   drug     tests.\n\nHowever,      Congress      could     reasonably     assign    to     courts     the\n\nresponsibility for deciding the maximum number of drug tests to be\n\nperformed beyond the minimum of three mandated by Congress.                      See\n\nUnited States v. Bonanno, 146 F.3d 502, 511 (7th Cir. 1998)\n\n(holding      that   \"18    U.S.C.    §   3583(d)   requires   that    the     court\n\ndetermine the number of drug tests to which the defendants must\n\nsubmit\") (emphasis in original).            Indeed, there is symmetry in the\n\nCongressional approach because both the statute and the Guidelines\n\ngive the court the authority to waive the testing requirement\n\ncompletely upon a finding of \"a low risk of future substance abuse\n\nby the defendant.\" 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(5); U.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(a)(4).\n\nTo respond to concerns about a high risk of future substance abuse,\n\nthe court can also establish the maximum number of drug tests to be\n\nperformed.\n\n              This responsibility does not mean that the court has to\n\nspecify the exact number of tests to be performed. Consistent with\n\nthe statutory language, it may specify a range, allowing probation\n\nofficers to exercise discretion on the number of drug tests to be\n\n\n                                          -21-\n\fperformed within that range.   See United States v. Guy, 174 F.3d\n\n859, 862 (7th Cir. 1999) (concluding that a condition requiring the\n\ndefendant to submit to \"'random drug tests as ordered by the\n\nProbation Office, not to exceed 104 tests per year'\" did not\n\nconstitute plain error).    The court may not, however, vest the\n\nprobation officer with the discretion to order an unlimited number\n\nof drug tests.\n\n          The government, arguing that this plain text reading of\n\nthe statute and Guidelines should not control, requested that we\n\nuphold the condition by following the reasoning of the court in\n\nUnited States v. Smith, 45 F. Supp. 2d 914 (M.D. Ala. 1999).   The\n\nSmith Court evaluated a drug testing condition similar to the one\n\nin this case and rejected the defendant's delegation claim.\n\n          The Smith Court rested its holding on three arguments:\n\n1) the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (the\n\n\"1994 Act\"), Pub. L. 103-322, which set forth the \"(as determined\n\nby the court)\" language in Section 3583(d), only used that language\n\nto describe the minimum of three tests that a court must impose\n\npursuant to the plain language of § 3583(d), and to give courts\n\ndiscretion to reduce the minimum number of drug tests below three\n\nwithout requiring courts to set the maximum number of tests; 2)\n\nprobation officers had the discretion to order drug tests prior to\n\nthe passage of the 1994 Act and nothing in that act manifested\n\nCongress's intention to withdraw that discretion; and 3) limiting\n\n\n                               -22-\n\fthe probation officers' discretion could limit the number of tests\n\nthat a    probationer   is   required   to   undergo   and   undermine   the\n\nefficiency of the supervised release system.\n\n            We frankly find Smith's reading of the statutory language\n\ndifficult to follow.     The phrase \"as determined by the court\" is\n\nunnecessary to achieve Congress's evident intent in Section 3583(d)\n\nto require courts, in the ordinary case, to require a minimum of\n\nthree drug tests. Remove the language \"as determined by the court\"\n\nfrom Section 3583(d) and the requirement that there be a minimum of\n\nthree drug tests is still there.         If courts, in the exceptional\n\ncase, want to disregard the requirement of Section 3583(d) that\n\nthree drug tests be performed, and to order fewer or no tests, they\n\nalready have that authority pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(5).11\n\nAgain, the \"as determined by the court\" language in Section 3583(d)\n\nis unnecessary to achieve the purpose attributed to it by the Smith\n\nCourt.    If this language is unnecessary to impose the requirement\n\nof three drug tests as the norm or to give courts the discretion to\n\nreduce or eliminate that minimum in exceptional cases, the \"as\n\ndetermined by the court\" language can only mean that the court is\n\nrequired to determine the maximum number of drug tests to be\n\nperformed beyond the three that are required.                Otherwise, the\n\n\n     11\n      That provision states that the mandatory drug testing\ncondition \"may be ameliorated or suspended by the court for any\nindividual defendant if the defendant's presentence report or other\nreliable sentencing information indicates a low risk of future\nsubstance abuse by the defendant . . . .\" 18 U.S.C. § 3563(a)(5).\n\n                                  -23-\n\flanguage is superfluous.        See, e.g., Allende v. Shultz, 845 F.2d\n\n1111, 1117 (1st Cir. 1988) (\"'It is the duty of the court to give\n\neffect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute,\n\navoiding, if it may be, any construction which implies that the\n\nlegislature    was   ignorant   of   the    meaning   of    the    language   it\n\nemployed.'\") (quoting Montclair v. Ramsdell, 107 U.S. (17 Otto)\n\n147, 152 (1883)).\n\n           The Smith Court says that the \"as determined by the\n\ncourt\" language gives the court discretion to alter the maximum\n\nnumber of drug tests but does not require it to do so, leaving\n\nintact the authority of probation officers to determine the maximum\n\nnumber of drug tests to be performed.         This reading simply ignores\n\nthe plain language of Section 3583(d), which gives the courts the\n\nresponsibility to determine the maximum number of drug tests beyond\n\nthree   that   would   be   required.       Courts    cannot      fulfill    this\n\nCongressionally-assigned        responsibility       by    assigning    it     to\n\nprobation officers.     To the extent that the Smith Court makes a\n\nfair policy point that it is impractical to expect courts to decide\n\nyears before a defendant is released \"exactly how many drug tests\n\nwould be required after the defendant's release from prison,\"\n\nSmith, 45 F. Supp. 2d. at 918, the authority of courts to set a\n\nrange of drug tests to be performed pursuant to the statutory\n\nlanguage meets this practical concern.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -24-\n\f          While it is true that, prior to the passage of the 1994\n\nact, probation officers had discretion to order tests independently\n\nof any directive from the court, see Smith, 45 F. Supp. 2d at 917\n\n(noting that \"probation officers had broad discretion to administer\n\ndrug tests, without specific authorization from the sentencing\n\ncourt\"), we conclude that Congress's refusal to include probation\n\nofficers in the section of the 1994 Act that became 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3583(d) manifests its intent to alter the existing practice.\n\nCongress explicitly referred to \"the chief probation officer in\n\neach district\" in another section of the 1994 Act and conferred\n\nupon those officers the responsibility of establishing a drug\n\ntesting program.    See Section 20414 (codified at 18 U.S.C. §\n\n3608).12 Congress clearly understood the role of probation officers\n\nin providing for and administering drug programs, yet Congress\n\nincluded no reference to probation officers in the drug testing\n\nlanguage of 18 U.S.C. 3583(d); instead, it referred only to courts\n\n\n     12\n      That provision states:\n     The Director of the Administrative Office of the United\n     States Courts, in consultation with the Attorney General\n     and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, shall,\n     subject to the availability of appropriations, establish\n     a program of drug testing of Federal offenders on\n     post-conviction release. The program shall include such\n     standards and guidelines as the Director may determine\n     necessary to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the\n     drug testing programs. In each judicial district the\n     chief probation officer shall arrange for the drug\n     testing of defendants on post-conviction release pursuant\n     to a conviction for a felony or other offense described\n     in section 3563(a)(4).\n18 U.S.C. § 3608 (2000).\n\n                               -25-\n\fdetermining the number of drug tests.

[,] it is generally presumed that Congress acts\n\nintentionally      and    purposely   in     the    disparate   inclusion     or\n\nexclusion.'\") (citation omitted).\n\n            Furthermore, the general statutory provisions in the\n\nSentencing Reform Act of 1984, P.L. 98-473,§ 212(a)(2), 98 Stat.\n\n2002 (codified at 18 U.S.C. § 3603), relied on by the Smith Court\n\nas evidence that Congress gave probation officers the authority to\n\nrequire drug tests, were superceded by the more specific provision\n\nin   the   1994   Act    that   explicitly   gave    that   power   to   courts.\n\nAccording to the Smith Court, three provisions in the Sentencing\n\nReform Act grant probation officers authority to determine the\n\nmaximum number of drug tests to be performed:\n\n            Section 3603 . . . provides that probation\n            officers shall \"keep informed, to the degree\n            required by the conditions specified by the\n            sentencing court, as to the conduct and\n            condition of . . . a person on supervised\n            release, who is under his supervision,\" 18\n            U.S.C.A. § 3603(2), \"use all suitable methods,\n            not inconsistent with the conditions specified\n            by the court, to aid . . . a person on\n            supervised   release    who   is   under   his\n            supervision, and to bring about improvements\n            in his conduct and condition,\" 18 U.S.C.A. §\n            3603(3), and \"keep informed concerning the\n            conduct, condition, and compliance with any\n            condition of probation ... of each probationer\n            under his supervision.\" 18 U.S.C.A. § 3603(7).\n            These provisions clearly grant probation\n\n\n                                      -26-\n\f               officers significant discretion in the means\n               they use to accomplish a court's order.\n\nSmith, 45 F. Supp. 2d at 919.       Notably, these responsibilities are\n\nframed    in    general   terms,   and   none    of   the    cited   provisions\n\nexplicitly reference drug testing.            Moreover, the specific drug\n\ntesting language of 18 U.S.C. § 3583(d) post-dates the Sentencing\n\nReform Act by ten years.        See Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. v.\n\nE.P.A., 824 F.2d 1258, 1278 (1st Cir. 1987) (\"[T]he most recent and\n\nmore specific Congressional pronouncement will prevail over a\n\nprior, more generalized statute.\").             We reject the government's\n\ninvitation to use the general language of the 1984 act as a\n\njustification for ignoring Section 3583(d)'s plain, explicit text.\n\n               To be sure, there is some force to the Smith Court's\n\nconcerns about the policy advantages of a supervised release system\n\nthat allows       probation   officers   to   decide   the    extent   of   drug\n\ntesting. Legislative history does not reveal why Congress chose to\n\ngo in a different direction.         But we cannot be faithful to the\n\nCongressional choice if we allow any policy reservations to control\n\nour reading of statutory language.            By its plain terms, Section\n\n3583(d) requires courts to determine the maximum number of drug\n\ntests to be performed beyond the statutory minimum of three, with\n\nprobation officers permitted to decide the number of tests to be\n\nperformed within the range established by the court.13\n\n\n     13\n          We entertained the possibility in United States v.\nMerric, 166 F.3d 406, 409 (1st Cir. 1999) that a court could\n\n                                    -27-\n\f          Since   we   conclude   that   the   sentencing   court's   drug\n\n\nsatisfy its responsibility under a statutory provision stating\n\"[t]he length of time over which scheduled [fine] payments will be\nmade shall be set by the [sentencing] court,\" 18 U.S.C. §\n3572(d)(2), by delegating that responsibility to a probation\nofficer, see id. (\"conceivably, 'set' could include delegation\").\nHowever, we rejected that possibility because \"it is the inherent\nresponsibility of the judge to determine matters of punishment and\nthis includes final authority over all payment matters.\"        Id.\nOther courts reviewing similar language have held that Congress's\nuse of the word \"set\" precludes delegation.       United States v.\nMcGlothlin, 249 F.3d 783, 785 (8th Cir. 2001) (\"We interpret this\nstatement to require the district court to set a detailed payment\nschedule at sentencing.\"). We do not have to rule out the\npossibility that in some statutory settings phrases such as \"set by\nthe court\" or \"determined by the court\" could include delegation to\nconclude here that the phrase \"as determined by the court\" does not\npermit delegation. As noted, prior to the enactment of Section\n3583(d) as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement\nAct of 1994, probation officers already had the authority to\nestablish the maximum number of drug tests to be performed. If\nCongress wanted the courts to delegate that responsibility to\nprobation officers, there was no need for Section 3583(d).\n     There is an instructive precedent in Congress's enactment in\n1996 of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act.        In that act,\nCongress amended general pre-existing language when it required\ncourts to \"set\" the restitution payment schedule. The Eleventh\nCircuit found that amendment to be significant on the delegation\nissue:\n     In contrast, the predecessor statute to the MVRA, the\n     Victims and Witness Protection Act of 1982, provided that\n     the court could \"require that [the] defendant make\n     restitution ... within a specified period or in specified\n     installments,\" but did not expressly state that the court\n     must set the terms of repayment in the restitution order.\n     By contrast, the plain language of the MVRA expressly\n     precludes delegation of repayment scheduling to the\n     probation office by providing that \"the length of time\n     over which scheduled payments will be made shall be set\n     by the court ....\" 18 U.S.C. § 3572(d)(2). This new\n     language has removed any ambiguity that might have\n     existed in the predecessor statute regarding the\n     permissibility of delegating authority to determine the\n     installment schedule.\nUnited States v. Prouty, 303 F.3d 1249, 1254 n.3 (11th Cir. 2002).\n\n\n                                  -28-\n\ftesting condition delegated its sentencing authority in violation\n\nof a clear Congressional mandate, and that this disregard of the\n\nCongressional mandate was plain error, we must vacate the drug\n\ntesting provisions in Meléndez's sentences and remand for re-\n\nsentencing.\n\n3.           Disclosure of Financial Information\n\n             The sentencing court included a special condition in its\n\nwritten     orders   that   required   Meléndez      to   \"provide    the   U.S.\n\nProbation Officer access to any financial information upon request\n\nand produce evidence to the effect that annual income tax returns\n\nhave been duly filed within his place of residence as required by\n\nlaw.\"       The court did not mention that condition at the first\n\nhearing, Appeal No. 01-2386, but it did mention it at the second.\n\nMeléndez claims that the court erred substantively, since neither\n\nconviction     warranted     the   inclusion    of    this   condition,      and\n\nprocedurally since it failed to include the condition in the oral\n\norder in Appeal No. 01-2386.         We will first evaluate whether the\n\nsentencing court substantively abused its discretion by including\n\nthis    condition.14    An    infirmity     there    would   moot    Meléndez's\n\nprocedural claim.\n\na.     Substantive Concern\n\n             Guideline § 5D1.3(d) states as follows:\n\n\n       14\n      We are reviewing Meléndez's substantive claim for abuse of\ndiscretion because he did not have the opportunity to object to\nthis provision in Appeal No. 01-2386.\n\n                                     -29-\n\f           The   following   \"special\"   conditions   of\n           supervised release are recommended in the\n           circumstances described and, in addition, may\n           otherwise be appropriate in particular cases:\n\n           ...\n           3) Access to Financial Information\n           If the court imposes an order of restitution,\n           forfeiture, or notice to victims, or orders\n           the defendant to pay a fine--a condition\n           requiring the defendant to provide the\n           probation officer access to any requested\n           financial information.\n\nU.S.S.G. § 5D1.3(d)(3).\n\n           The court, after taking Meléndez's financial condition\n\ninto account, did not include a fine as part of his sentence and\n\ndid not order him to pay restitution; therefore, he does not meet\n\nthe listed conditions. That does not mean, however, that the court\n\nwas not justified in imposing the disclosure requirement.              The\n\nGuidelines allow such conditions when they are \"appropriate in\n\nparticular cases.\"     Id.    \"A sentencing judge has broad discretion\n\nto impose special conditions of release that are 'reasonably\n\nrelated'   to   (1)     the     defendant's     offense,   history    and\n\ncharacteristics; (2) the need for adequate deterrence; and (3) the\n\nneed to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\"\n\nUnited States v. Phaneuf       91 F.3d 255, 263 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n           According    to     the   stipulated   statement   of     facts\n\naccompanying the plea agreement in Appeal No. 01-2386, Meléndez was\n\nresponsible for financing the purchase of twenty-five kilograms of\n\ncocaine at a cost of $300,000.              In Appeal No. 01-2397, the\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fpassenger he dropped off at the airport was found with $36,000 in\n\ncash in a bag.   Forcing Meléndez to provide financial records to\n\nthe probation officer would assist the officer in detecting whether\n\nhe has returned to his criminal ways.   As we recently observed when\n\nwe upheld a similar condition imposed under similar circumstances:\n\n          The special condition allows the court,\n          through the probation department, to monitor\n          the appellant's earnings and identify any\n          potential disparity between his income and his\n          lifestyle. Relatedly, it serves to deter the\n          appellant from engaging in schemes similar to\n          the crimes of conviction once he is released\n          from prison by forcing him to account for his\n          income.\n\nUnited States v. Mansur-Ramos, 348 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nGiven the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the district\n\ncourt's imposition of this condition did not constitute an abuse of\n\ndiscretion.\n\nb.        Right to Be Present at Sentencing\n\n          Meléndez also claims that the court violated his right to\n\nbe present during sentencing by not including the special financial\n\ndisclosure condition in the oral sentencing order for the first\n\nsentence that the court imposed on August 21.     Assuming arguendo\n\nthat the court's failure to include the disclosure condition in its\n\noral sentencing order violated Meléndez's right to be present at\n\nsentencing, we conclude that this error was harmless.\n\n          The court included the financial disclosure requirement\n\nin its oral sentencing order for Appeal No. 01-2397.    Meléndez had\n\n\n                               -31-\n\fthe opportunity to either object or to provide additional arguments\n\nat that time, but he failed to do so.   Given that failure, he would\n\nnot have objected if the court noted the same requirement at the\n\nhearing for Appeal No. 01-2386, held immediately prior to the\n\nsecond sentencing hearing.     The court's error, therefore, was\n\nharmless.    See Rushen v. Spain, 464 U.S. 114, 119 n.2 (1983)\n\n(noting that \"right to be present\" claims are subject to harmless\n\nerror analysis).     Accordingly, we affirm the inclusion of the\n\nspecial financial disclosure condition in Appeal No. 01-2386.\n\n                               III.\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the supervised\n\nrelease conditions regarding drug treatment and drug testing in\n\nboth appeals as well as the four year supervised release term in\n\nAppeal No. 01-2397; we ORDER modification of the judgment in Appeal\n\nNo. 01-2397; we AFFIRM the remainder of the sentences; and we\n\nREMAND for re-sentencing in both appeals consistent with this\n\nopinion.\n\n            SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                               -32-\n\f",

This evaluation, in turn, requires us to consider the amount of discretion a sentencing court may delegate to probation officers and whether a condition that is included in a written sentencing order but not announced at the sentencing hearing violates a defendant's constitutional rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Appeal No. 01-2386, the defendant, Rafael Mel&#233;ndez-Santana (\"Mel&#233;ndez\"), and three other individuals met an undercover DEA agent and a police informant on August 21, 2000, in a shopping mall parking lot to purchase twenty-five kilograms of cocaine. The parties had previously negotiated a sales price of $12,000 per kilogram for a total of $300,000. Mel&#233;ndez agreed to finance this purchase. When Mel&#233;ndez opened the trunk of his car and showed the purported sellers a portion of the money, DEA agents arrested him and his associates. They found a Beretta 9mm pistol in his possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Appeal No. 01-2397, Mel&#233;ndez committed the crimes approximately three months prior to his arrest on the charges involved in Appeal No. 01-2386. The details regarding this earlier conduct as reported in the parties' stipulated statement of facts are sparse. It appears that Mel&#233;ndez dropped an individual off at the airport who was carrying $36,000 in a bag. A search of the van that Mel&#233;ndez was driving produced approximately a kilogram of cocaine, approximately five hundred (500) grams of heroin and several weapons. The stipulated statement of facts did not indicate why Mel&#233;ndez was not arrested at the airport on that day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 21, 2000, a federal grand jury in Puerto Rico indicted Mel&#233;ndez on four counts for the August 21 conduct. The indictment included one count of possession with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and aiding and abetting. Mel&#233;ndez pled guilty to the drug possession and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense counts on January 23, 2001. On August 21, 2001, the district court sentenced him to a term of twenty-four months on the first charge and sixty months on the second. The terms were to be served consecutively. He was also sentenced to three years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of that sentencing hearing, Mel&#233;ndez's attorney advised the court that an information had been filed against Mel&#233;ndez in Appeal No. 01-2397, the case involving the earlier criminal conduct at the airport. In that case, the government accused him of possession with intent to distribute one kilogram of cocaine and approximately five hundred grams of heroin. Mel&#233;ndez waived his right to indictment and the preparation of a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) and pled guilty. In exchange for his plea, the parties agreed that he would be held accountable for more than four hundred grams but less than five hundred grams of cocaine. He was sentenced during the same hearing to a term of thirty-seven months of imprisonment, to be served consecutively to the sentence in Appeal No. 01-2386. He was also sentenced to a supervised release term of four years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez filed a timely appeal from his sentences, raising a series of challenges to the length of his sentence and to the terms of his supervised release. After a careful review of the record, we affirm part of his sentences, vacate other portions and remand for re-sentencing by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis with some background information on the supervised release system. Congress abolished the existing parole system in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, &#167; 212(a)(2), 98 Stat. 1999 (codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583 (2000)), and replaced it with a new system of \"supervised release.\" The two systems are similar in that both allow former inmates to reenter society under official control. However, under supervised release, courts, rather than the Parole Commission, are responsible for setting and enforcing the conditions of release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Sentencing Guidelines generally require courts to impose a term of supervised release to follow every felony &#8212; or when otherwise required by statute &#8212; and they give the courts the option to do so in all other cases. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.1. These terms normally last one to five years. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5D1.2(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines list a series of conditions of supervised release that fall into three categories: 1) mandatory conditions that courts must include in every sentencing order; 2) standard conditions that are recommended but not required; and 3) special conditions that are not required but can be imposed under certain circumstances. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3. The seven mandatory conditions include basic correctional provisions such as \"the defendant shall not commit another federal, state or local offense,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 5D1.3(a)(1), and \"the defendant shall not unlawfully possess a controlled substance,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 5D1.3(a)(2). The fifteen standard conditions generally relate to the defendant's responsibilities toward his probation officer. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> &#167; 5D1.3(c)(3) (\"[T]he defendant shall answer truthfully all inquiries by the probation officer and follow the instructions of the probation officer.\"). They also include rehabilitative requirements, such as a condition mandating that the defendant keep a job. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5D1.3(c)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the mandatory and standard conditions, there are twelve \"special\" conditions listed in Sections 5D1.3(d) and 5D1.3(e) of the Guidelines. Section 5D1.3(d) consists of seven special conditions that are recommended in situations in which certain predicate facts are present. For example, one provision bars defendants who have been convicted of felonies or used dangerous weapons in the course of their crimes from possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5D1.3(d)(1). Other provisions mandate that the defendants participate in drug and mental health treatment programs when the court finds that such treatment is necessary. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5D1.3(d). Section 5D1.3(e) lists additional special conditions that \"may be appropriate on a case-by-case basis.\" These special conditions include a curfew, home detention and community service requirements. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5D1.3(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a released inmate violates the terms of supervised release, the court may impose serious punishments, up to and including requiring the violator to serve his release term in prison. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3). Under certain circumstances, such as where the defendant possesses illegal drugs or refuses to comply with drug testing requirements, the court must revoke his term of supervised release and reimprison him. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(g). We turn now to Mel&#233;ndez's specific claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. Four Year Supervised Release Term</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez claims &#8212; and the government agrees &#8212; that the district court erroneously departed from the United States Sentencing Guidelines when it sentenced him to a four-year supervised release term in Appeal No. 01-2397, the case involving the information and the earlier criminal conduct. We concur.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before a court may impose a sentence exceeding the Guidelines, it \"must give prior notice to the defendant of its intention to impose a term of such an extended duration and must state on the record the aggravating circumstances that justify the upward departure.\" <i>United States v.

The government charged Mel&#233;ndez in an information with possession with intent to distribute one kilogram of cocaine and 500 grams of heroin in Appeal No. 01-2397. Mel&#233;ndez waived indictment, trial, and the preparation of a Pre-sentence Report and agreed to plead guilty. Under the terms of that plea agreement, however, the parties stipulated that he would plead guilty to possession with the intent to distribute at least four hundred but less than five hundred grams of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original offense for which Mel&#233;ndez was charged in the information carried a mandatory four-year term of supervised release, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B), but the offense to which he actually pled guilty only carried a statutory mandatory term of three years of supervised release. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). The sentencing court erroneously imposed the supervised release term that accompanied the original charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Since the resulting sentence exceeded the Guidelines for the offense for which he actually was found guilty, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.2(a), and since the court failed to provide advance notice of this departure, we vacate the four-year supervised release provision in Appeal No. 01-2397. We also vacate the portion of the judgment that states that Mel&#233;ndez pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute one kilogram of cocaine and five hundred grams of heroin. As noted, Mel&#233;ndez actually pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute four hundred but less than five hundred grams of cocaine, and the judgment should be corrected to reflect this fact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Consecutive Sentences</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez claims that the district court erroneously ordered him to serve the sentences in Appeal Nos. 01-2386 and 01-2397 consecutively. In his view, the convictions should be considered multiple counts of the same case for sentencing purposes. He contends that the offenses all involved similar conduct, that these offenses occurred only three months apart, that he was not arrested until after he had taken the actions underlying the charges in both cases, and that both cases were disposed of on the same day in the same proceeding. On this basis, he argues that his sentences should run concurrently. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.2; <i>United States v. Qui&#241;ones,</i> 26 F.3d 213, 217 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that a court may impose consecutive sentences for multiple-count cases only after following the accepted protocol for guideline departures).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government asserts that Mel&#233;ndez has waived this claim by failing to present it first to the district court. It also contends that, in any event, there was no plain error. As it notes, the court simply followed the parties' recommendation in their plea agreement by imposing a consecutive sentence in the second case after first securing Mel&#233;ndez's confirmation that he had agreed to the consecutive sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Mel&#233;ndez acknowledges that he agreed to the consecutive sentence, he contends that the plea agreement also stated that he would be sentenced in accordance with the Sentencing Guidelines and that the sentencing recommendation was in conflict with the Guidelines. Without case law or other support, he argues that we should resolve the conflict in favor of the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these facts, we agree that Mel&#233;ndez has waived his claim. We also agree that there was no plain error. The record shows that Mel&#233;ndez entered into his plea agreement voluntarily and knowingly, realizing full well that he would receive the consecutive sentence that he did. In effect, Mel&#233;ndez is asking us to relieve him of his obligations under the plea agreement, even though the government has lived up to its commitments. We decline to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Conditions of Supervised Release</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez claims that the district court's imposition of conditions of supervised release included a number of procedural and substantive errors. Specifically, he claims that the court violated his Sixth Amendment right to be present at his sentencing by including a special drug treatment condition in the written sentencing orders without announcing that condition at the sentencing hearings. He also claims that the drug treatment provision constituted an impermissible delegation of judicial authority since it allowed a probation officer to determine whether he had to undergo treatment. He claims that a provision requiring him to undergo drug testing also constituted an impermissible delegation since it allowed the probation officer to decide how many drug tests he had to undergo. Finally, he claims that the court abused its discretion by requiring him to provide financial records to the probation officer, and again violated his Sixth Amendment rights by not imposing that financial records condition at one of his hearings. We will review each claim in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Drug Treatment Condition</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez claims that the sentencing court impermissibly delegated its sentencing authority by allowing a probation officer to decide whether he might have to attend drug treatment. The condition states that if Mel&#233;ndez tests positive for drugs, \"at the discretion of the probation officer, [he shall] participate in a substance abuse treatment program arranged and approved by the probation officer until duly discharged by authorized program personnel with the approval of the probation officer.\" He also claims that since that condition was only included in the written orders setting forth the terms of supervised release but was never imposed as a condition at his sentencing hearing, the court violated his Sixth Amendment right to be present at sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.

R.Crim.P. 43(a) (\"[T]he defendant must be present at... sentencing.\"). The Supreme Court has stated that the constitutional aspect of this right is \"rooted to a large extent in the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment,\" but that it also derives from the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. <i>United States v. Gagnon,</i> 470 U.S. 522, 526, 105 S.Ct. 1482, 84 L.Ed.2d 486 (1985). Although a defendant does not have a right to be present at every minor stage in a trial, due process concerns are implicated</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[w]henever [the defendant's] presence has a relation, reasonably substantial, to the fulness of his opportunity to defend against the charge.... [T]he presence of a defendant is a condition of due process to the extent that a fair and just hearing would be thwarted by his absence, and to that extent only.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (quoting <i>Snyder v. Massachusetts,</i> 291 U.S. 97, 105-06, 108, 54 S.Ct. 330, 78 L.Ed. 674 (1934)). Since the defendant's absence from a sentencing hearing could threaten his ability to obtain a fair and just hearing on the important issues of punishment and rehabilitation addressed at such a hearing, the Court's due process concerns in <i>Gagnon</i> are relevant to the sentencing stage of a trial. <i>See Thompson v. United States,</i> 495 F.2d 1304, 1306 (1st Cir.1974) (\"[T]he alleged failure of petitioner to be present at his own sentencing is an error which... affects seriously the fairness, integrity and public reputation of judicial proceedings.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a consequence of the defendant's right to be present at the sentencing hearing, we have previously stated, in dicta, that \"`[w]here... [a] district court's oral expression of its sentencing rationale varies materially from its subsequent written expression of that rationale, appellate courts have tended to honor the former at the expense of the latter.'\" <i>United States v. Cali,</i> 87 F.3d 571, 579 (1st Cir.1996) (quoting dictum in <i>United States v. Muniz,</i> 49 F.3d 36, 42 n. 5 (1st Cir.1995)). Nearly all of the other circuits have reached similar conclusions, although there has been some variation in the exact phrasing of this doctrine. <i>See, e.g., United States v. DeMartino,</i> 112 F.3d 75, 78 (2d Cir.1997) (\"[I]f there is a variance between the oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment of conviction, the oral sentence generally controls.\"); <i>United States v. Faulks,</i> 201 F.3d 208, 211 (3d Cir.2000) (\"A long line of cases provides that when the two sentences are in conflict, the oral pronouncement prevails over the written judgment.\"); <i>United States v. Morse,</i> 344 F.2d 27, 29 n. 1 (4th Cir.1965) (\"To the extent of any conflict between [a] written order and [an] oral sentence, the latter is controlling.\"); <i>United States v. Martinez,</i> 250 F.3d 941, 942 (5th Cir.2001) (\"[W]hen there is a conflict between a written sentence and an oral pronouncement, the oral pronouncement controls.\"); <i>United States v. Becker,</i> 36 F.3d 708, 710 (7th Cir. 1994) (\"If an inconsistency exists between an oral and the later written sentence, the sentence pronounced from the bench controls.\"); <i>United States v. Glass,</i> 720 F.2d 21, 22 n. 2 (8th Cir.1983) (\"Where an oral sentence and the written judgment conflict, the oral sentence controls.\"); <i>United States v. Hicks,</i> 997 F.2d 594, 597 (9th Cir.1993) (\"`In cases where there is a direct conflict between an unambiguous, oral pronouncement of sentence and the written judgment and commitment, this [c]ourt has uniformly held that the oral pronouncement, as correctly reported, must control.'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Munoz-Dela Rosa,</i> 495 F.2d 253, 256 (9th Cir.1974)); <i>United States v. Marquez,</i> 337 F.3d 1203, 1207 n. 1 (10th Cir.2003) (\"[A]n oral pronouncement of sentence from the bench controls over other written language....\"). Accordingly, we conclude that where the conditions of supervised release announced at the sentencing hearing conflict in a material way with the conditions of supervised release in the written sentencing order, the oral conditions control.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The failure of the sentencing court to announce the drug treatment condition at the sentencing hearing created a material conflict between the written and oral sentencing orders. The court imposed a potentially significant new burden on the Defendant &#8212; permitting a probation officer to order him to attend a residential treatment program if he failed a drug test &#8212; without giving him the opportunity to object to the condition at the sentencing hearing. This procedure violated Mel&#233;ndez's right to be present at sentencing. We must vacate the drug treatment condition on this basis alone.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

That defect involves the amount of discretion that the court delegated to the probation officer to decide whether Mel&#233;ndez must participate in a drug treatment program.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Article III of the Constitution vests responsibility for resolving cases and controversies with the courts. As Justice Kennedy observed during his tenure on the Ninth Circuit, this responsibility requires \"both the appearance and the reality of control by Article III judges over the interpretation, declaration, and application of federal law\" to maintain \"the essential, constitutional role of the judiciary.\" <i>Pacemaker Diagnostic Clinic of America, Inc. v. Instromedix, Inc.,</i> 725 F.2d 537, 544 (9th Cir.1984) (Kennedy, J.). The judiciary's \"essential role\" can be eroded just as easily through improvident delegation as through interference by another branch, <i>id.;</i> therefore, separation of powers forbids courts from delegating their Article III responsibilities. However, \"`[t]hat general principle does not ... prohibit courts from using nonjudicial officers to support judicial functions, as long as that judicial officer retains and exercises ultimate responsibility.'\" <i>United States v. Allen,</i> 312 F.3d 512, 515-16 (1st Cir.2002) (quoting <i>United States v. Johnson,</i> 48 F.3d 806, 809 (4th Cir.1995)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>Allen,</i> we upheld the sentencing court's imposition of a condition of supervised release that required the defendant to participate in a mental health treatment program \"as directed by the probation officer.\" <i>Allen,</i> 312 F.3d at 515. We determined that the court itself retained ultimate sentencing authority by requiring the defendant to undergo treatment and that it had merely delegated \"administrative details\" to the probation officer. <i>Id.</i> at 516. In reaching this holding, we contrasted the facts in <i>Allen</i> with those in <i>United States v. Kent,</i> 209 F.3d 1073 (8th Cir.2000), in which the court struck down a condition that allowed the probation officer to make the ultimate decision regarding whether the defendant would have to undergo treatment. Stated simply, the probation officer in <i>Allen</i> was not deciding <i>whether</i> the defendant had to attend counseling but how many sessions he had to attend. <i>See also United States v. Peterson,</i> 248 F.3d 79, 84-85 (2d Cir.2001) (concluding that delegation would be permissible regarding scheduling and selection of mental health therapy sessions).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court's delegation to the probation officer of the treatment decision in this case contravenes our ruling in <i>Allen.</i> The drug treatment condition states that if Mel&#233;ndez fails a drug test, he must participate in a treatment program \"at the discretion of the probation officer.\" Rather than simply vesting the probation officer with the responsibility for managing the administrative details of drug treatment, the court granted the probation officer the authority to decide whether Mel&#233;ndez would have to undergo treatment after testing positive for drugs.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> That treatment decision must be made by the court, either at the time of sentencing,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> or later in response to a motion by the probation officer, citing the positive drug test during the period of supervised release and seeking a change in the conditions of supervised release.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Drug Testing Requirement</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez claims that the district court impermissibly delegated its authority to a probation officer when it allowed the officer to decide how many drug tests he would be required to undergo. Since he failed to object to this aspect of his sentence below, we review for plain error. <i>Allen,</i> 312 F.3d at 514.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. The Terms of the Order</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The oral and written orders in these appeals conflict regarding the amount of discretion the court delegated to the probation officer. The written sentencing orders in both cases stated: \"The defendant shall refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance and shall submit to one drug test within 15 days of release on supervised release and at least two (2) periodic drug tests thereafter, when so requested by the U.S. Probation Officer.\" The oral orders did not include the provision requiring \"at least two (2) periodic drug tests thereafter.\" The oral order in Appeal No. 01-2386 stated: \"The defendant shall refrain from any unlawful use of controlled substances and shall submit to drug testing within 15 days of release on supervised release and thereafter whenever so required by the probation officer.\" The oral order in 01-2397 was virtually identical. Therefore, pursuant to the written orders, the probation officer had to require at least two additional drug tests after the initial drug test within fifteen days of release; however, under the oral orders, the probation officer could forego any additional drug tests after the initial test. Although there is a conflict between the oral and written orders as to the number of drug tests required, we do not have to decide if this is a material conflict requiring a ruling that the oral order controls. <i>See supra</i> Section II.C.1.a. That is so because both the oral and written orders suffer from the same delegation infirmity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Delegation</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both a statute and the United States Sentencing Guidelines require the sentencing court to order that the defendant \"refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance and submit to a drug test within 15 days of release on supervised release and at least 2 periodic drug tests thereafter (<i>as determined by the court</i>) for use of a controlled substance.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d) (2000); U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(a)(4) (emphasis added).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The court may only waive this requirement \"if the defendant's presentence report or other reliable sentencing information indicates a low risk of future substance abuse by the defendant.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3563(a)(5); U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(a)(4). Mel&#233;ndez claims that the inclusion of the words \"as determined by the court\" means that the court, not the probation officer, must decide how many tests a defendant should be forced to undergo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, both the statute and the Guidelines state that following the initial \"drug test within 15 days of release,\" there must be \"at least 2 periodic drug tests thereafter (as determined by the court) for use of a controlled substance.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d) (2000); U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(a)(4). If there is any ambiguity in this text, it does not relate to the responsibility of the court to make the determination referenced in the statute. That responsibility could not be more explicit. But what is the determination that the court must make? The determination assigned to the court could either be the time frame for the two periodic drug tests mandated by the statute, or the number of additional drug tests to be required beyond the initial drug test within 15 days of release and the two periodic tests required by the statute. As a matter of language, the phrase \"at least\" establishes a minimum and implies that a maximum remains to be determined. As a matter of common sense, we do not think that Congress would require courts to become involved in the scheduling of drug tests. However, Congress could reasonably assign to courts the responsibility for deciding the maximum number of drug tests to be performed beyond the minimum of three mandated by Congress. <i>See United States v. Bonanno,</i> 146 F.3d 502, 511 (7th Cir.1998) (holding that \" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d) requires that <i>the court</i> determine the number of drug tests to which the defendants must submit\") (emphasis in original). Indeed, there is symmetry in the Congressional approach because both the statute and the Guidelines give the court the authority to waive the testing requirement completely upon a finding of \"a low risk of future substance abuse by the defendant.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3563(a)(5); U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(a)(4). To respond to concerns about a high risk of future substance abuse, the court can also establish the maximum number of drug tests to be performed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This responsibility does not mean that the court has to specify the exact number of tests to be performed. Consistent with the statutory language, it may specify a range, allowing probation officers to exercise discretion on the number of drug tests to be performed within that range. <i>See United States v. Guy,</i> 174 F.3d 859, 862 (7th Cir.1999) (concluding that a condition requiring the defendant to submit to \"`random drug tests as ordered by the Probation Office, not to exceed 104 tests per year'\" did not constitute plain error). The court may not, however, vest the probation officer with the discretion to order an unlimited number of drug tests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government, arguing that this plain text reading of the statute and Guidelines should not control, requested that we uphold the condition by following the reasoning of the court in <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 45 F.Supp.2d 914 (M.D.Ala.1999). The <i>Smith</i> Court evaluated a drug testing condition similar to the one in this case and rejected the defendant's delegation claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Smith</i> Court rested its holding on three arguments: 1) the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 (the \"1994 Act\"), Pub.L. 103-322, which set forth the \"(as determined by the court)\" language in Section 3583(d), only used that language to describe the minimum of three tests that a court must impose pursuant to the plain language of &#167; 3583(d), and to give courts discretion to reduce the minimum number of drug tests below three without requiring courts to set the maximum number of tests; 2) probation officers had the discretion to order drug tests prior to the passage of the 1994 Act and nothing in that act manifested Congress's intention to withdraw that discretion; and 3) limiting the probation officers' discretion could limit the number of tests that a probationer is required to undergo and undermine the efficiency of the supervised release system.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We frankly find <i>Smith's</i> reading of the statutory language difficult to follow. The phrase \"as determined by the court\" is unnecessary to achieve Congress's evident intent in Section 3583(d) to require courts, in the ordinary case, to require a minimum of three drug tests. Remove the language \"as determined by the court\" from Section 3583(d) and the requirement that there be a minimum of three drug tests is still there. If courts, in the exceptional case, want to disregard the requirement of Section 3583(d) that three drug tests be performed, and to order fewer or no tests, they already have that authority pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3563(a)(5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Again, the \"as determined by the court\" language in Section 3583(d) is unnecessary to achieve the purpose attributed to it by the <i>Smith</i> Court. If this language is unnecessary to impose the requirement of three drug tests as the norm or to give courts the discretion to reduce or eliminate that minimum in exceptional cases, the \"as determined by the court\" language can only mean that the court is required to determine the maximum number of drug tests to be performed beyond the three that are required. Otherwise, the language is superfluous. <i>See, e.g., Allende v. Shultz,</i> 845 F.2d 1111, 1117 (1st Cir.1988) (\"`It is the duty of the court to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute, avoiding, if it may be, any construction which implies that the legislature was ignorant of the meaning of the language it employed.'\") (quoting <i>Montclair v. Ramsdell,</i> 107 U.S. (17 Otto) 147, 152, 2 S.Ct. 391, 27 L.Ed. 431 (1883)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Smith</i> Court says that the \"as determined by the court\" language gives the court discretion to alter the maximum number of drug tests but does not require it to do so, leaving intact the authority of probation officers to determine the maximum number of drug tests to be performed. This reading simply ignores the plain language of Section 3583(d), which gives the courts the responsibility to determine the maximum number of drug tests beyond three that would be required. Courts cannot fulfill this Congressionally-assigned responsibility by assigning it to probation officers. To the extent that the <i>Smith</i> Court makes a fair policy point that it is impractical to expect courts to decide years before a defendant is released \"exactly how many drug tests would be required after the defendant's release from prison,\" <i>Smith,</i> 45 F.Supp.2d. at 918, the authority of courts to set a range of drug tests to be performed pursuant to the statutory language meets this practical concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is true that, prior to the passage of the 1994 act, probation officers had discretion to order tests independently of any directive from the court, <i>see Smith,</i> 45 F.Supp.2d at 917 (noting that \"probation officers had broad discretion to administer drug tests, without specific authorization from the sentencing court\"), we conclude that Congress's refusal to include probation officers in the section of the 1994 Act that became 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d) manifests its intent to alter the existing practice. Congress explicitly referred to \"the chief probation officer in each district\" in another section of the 1994 Act and conferred upon those officers the responsibility of establishing a drug testing program. <i>See</i> Section 20414 (codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3608).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Congress clearly understood the role of probation officers in providing for and administering drug programs, yet Congress included no reference to probation officers in the drug testing language of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d); instead, it referred only to courts determining the number of drug tests. <i>See Keene Corp. v. United States,</i> 508 U.S. 200, 208, 113 S.Ct. 2035, 124 L.Ed.2d 118 (1993) (\"`[W]here Congress includes particular language in one section of a statute but omits it in another...[,] it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.'\") (citation omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, the general statutory provisions in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, P.L. 98-473, &#167; 212(a)(2), 98 Stat.2002 (codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3603), relied on by the <i>Smith</i> Court as evidence that Congress gave probation officers the authority to require drug tests, were superceded by the more specific provision in the 1994 Act that explicitly gave that power to courts. According to the <i>Smith</i> Court, three provisions in the Sentencing Reform Act grant probation officers authority to determine the maximum number of drug tests to be performed:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3603 ... provides that probation officers shall \"keep informed, to the degree required by the conditions specified by the sentencing court, as to the conduct and condition of ... a person on supervised release, who is under his supervision,\" 18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 3603(2), \"use all suitable methods, not inconsistent with the conditions specified by the court, to aid ... a person on supervised release who is under his supervision, and to bring about improvements in his conduct and condition,\" 18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 3603(3), and \"keep informed concerning the conduct, condition, and compliance with any condition of probation ... of each probationer under his supervision.\" 18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 3603(7). These provisions clearly grant probation officers significant discretion in the means they use to accomplish a court's order.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Smith,</i> 45 F.Supp.2d at 919. Notably, these responsibilities are framed in general terms, and none of the cited provisions explicitly reference drug testing. Moreover, the specific drug testing language of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d) post-dates the Sentencing Reform Act by ten years. <i>See Natural Res. Def. Council, Inc. v. U.S.E.P.A.,</i> 824 F.2d 1258, 1278 (1st Cir.1987) (\"[T]he most recent and more specific Congressional pronouncement will prevail over a prior, more generalized statute.\"). We reject the government's invitation to use the general language of the 1984 act as a justification for ignoring Section 3583(d)'s plain, explicit text.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, there is some force to the <i>Smith</i> Court's concerns about the policy advantages of a supervised release system that allows probation officers to decide the extent of drug testing. Legislative history does not reveal why Congress chose to go in a different direction. But we cannot be faithful to the Congressional choice if we allow any policy reservations to control our reading of statutory language. By its plain terms, Section 3583(d) requires courts to determine the maximum number of drug tests to be performed beyond the statutory minimum of three, with probation officers permitted to decide the number of tests to be performed within the range established by the court.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since we conclude that the sentencing court's drug testing condition delegated its sentencing authority in violation of a clear Congressional mandate, and that this disregard of the Congressional mandate was plain error, we must vacate the drug testing provisions in Mel&#233;ndez's sentences and remand for re-sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Disclosure of Financial Information</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The sentencing court included a special condition in its written orders that required Mel&#233;ndez to \"provide the U.S. Probation Officer access to any financial information upon request and produce evidence to the effect that annual income tax returns have been duly filed within his place of residence as required by law.\" The court did not mention that condition at the first hearing, Appeal No. 01-2386, but it did mention it at the second. Mel&#233;ndez claims that the court erred substantively, since neither conviction warranted the inclusion of this condition, and procedurally since it failed to include the condition in the oral order in Appeal No. 01-2386. We will first evaluate whether the sentencing court substantively abused its discretion by including this condition.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a> An infirmity there would moot Mel&#233;ndez's procedural claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. Substantive Concern</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">Guideline &#167; 5D1.3(d) states as follows:</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The following \"special\" conditions of supervised release are recommended in the circumstances described and, in addition, may otherwise be appropriate in particular cases:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">...</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3) <i>Access to Financial Information</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the court imposes an order of restitution, forfeiture, or notice to victims, or orders the defendant to pay a fine &#8212; a condition requiring the defendant to provide the probation officer access to any requested financial information.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(d)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court, after taking Mel&#233;ndez's financial condition into account, did not include a fine as part of his sentence and did not order him to pay restitution; therefore, he does not meet the listed conditions. That does not mean, however, that the court was not justified in imposing the disclosure requirement. The Guidelines allow such conditions when they are \"appropriate in particular cases.\" <i>Id.</i> \"A sentencing judge has broad discretion to impose special conditions of release that are `reasonably related' to (1) the defendant's offense, history and characteristics; (2) the need for adequate deterrence; and (3) the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant.\" <i>United States v. Phaneuf</i> 91 F.3d 255, 263 (1st Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the stipulated statement of facts accompanying the plea agreement in Appeal No. 01-2386, Mel&#233;ndez was responsible for financing the purchase of twenty-five kilograms of cocaine at a cost of $300,000. In Appeal No. 01-2397, the passenger he dropped off at the airport was found with $36,000 in cash in a bag. Forcing Mel&#233;ndez to provide financial records to the probation officer would assist the officer in detecting whether he has returned to his criminal ways. As we recently observed when we upheld a similar condition imposed under similar circumstances:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The special condition allows the court, through the probation department, to monitor the appellant's earnings and identify any potential disparity between his income and his lifestyle. Relatedly, it serves to deter the appellant from engaging in schemes similar to the crimes of conviction once he is released from prison by forcing him to account for his income.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Mansur-Ramos,</i> 348 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir.2003). Given the circumstances of this case, we conclude that the district court's imposition of this condition did not constitute an abuse of discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. Right to Be Present at Sentencing</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez also claims that the court violated his right to be present during sentencing by not including the special financial disclosure condition in the oral sentencing order for the first sentence that the court imposed on August 21. Assuming arguendo that the court's failure to include the disclosure condition in its oral sentencing order violated Mel&#233;ndez's right to be present at sentencing, we conclude that this error was harmless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court included the financial disclosure requirement in its oral sentencing order for Appeal No. 01-2397. Mel&#233;ndez had the opportunity to either object or to provide additional arguments at that time, but he failed to do so. Given that failure, he would not have objected if the court noted the same requirement at the hearing for Appeal No. 01-2386, held immediately prior to the second sentencing hearing. The court's error, therefore, was harmless. <i>See Rushen v. Spain,</i> 464 U.S. 114, 119 n. 2, 104 S.Ct. 453, 78 L.Ed.2d 267 (1983) (noting that \"right to be present\" claims are subject to harmless error analysis). Accordingly, we affirm the inclusion of the special financial disclosure condition in Appeal No. 01-2386.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we VACATE the supervised release conditions regarding drug treatment and drug testing in both appeals as well as the four year supervised release term in Appeal No. 01-2397; we ORDER modification of the judgment in Appeal No. 01-2397; we AFFIRM the remainder of the sentences; and we REMAND for re-sentencing in both appeals consistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SO ORDERED.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In addition to the listed conditions, courts can also impose conditions \"to the extent that such conditions (1) are reasonably related to (A) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the history and characteristics of the defendant; (B) the need for the sentence imposed to afford adequate deterrence to criminal conduct; (C) the need to protect the public from further crimes of the defendant; and (D) the need to provide the defendant with needed educational or vocational training, medical care, or other correctional treatment in the most effective manner; and (2) involve no greater deprivation of liberty than is reasonably necessary for the purposes set forth above and are consistent with any pertinent policy statements issued by the Sentencing Commission.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(b)</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> Mel&#233;ndez did not object to this departure at sentencing. In<i>United States v. Cortes-Claudio,</i> 312 F.3d 17, 24 (1st Cir.2002), we held that while we generally review for plain error when a party fails to object at sentencing, we apply abuse of discretion review \"if the defendant could not reasonably have anticipated the issue would arise until after the court ruled.\" Since Cortes-Claudio could not reasonably have anticipated that the court would depart from the guidelines, we reviewed that sentence for abuse of discretion. <i>Id.</i> The same reasoning applies here. In practical terms, however, the distinction between the two standards of review is irrelevant to the outcome of this case since we would reach the same result under plain error review. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Mangone,</i> 105 F.3d 29, 36 (1st Cir.1997) (finding plain error when the sentencing court departed upward without giving prior notice).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> Our view that this was merely an oversight is supported by the thirty-seven month term of imprisonment that the court ordered. The offense level with which the sentencing judge started matches the Guidelines level for a crime involving four hundred but less than five hundred grams of cocaine but it is below the mandatory minimum sentence for crimes involving five hundred grams or more of cocaine<i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B) (setting a mandatory minimum prison sentence of five years for crimes involving five hundred grams but less than five kilograms of cocaine).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> The sentencing court allowed the defendant to waive the preparation of a separate PSR for this hearing.

Nevertheless, the Guidelines clearly state in a policy statement that \"[t]he defendant may not waive preparation of the presentence report,\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 6A1.1. The errors here illustrate the wisdom of that requirement.

However, we rejected that possibility because \"it is the inherent responsibility of the judge to determine matters of punishment and this includes final authority over all payment matters.\" <i>Id.</i> Other courts reviewing similar language have held that Congress's use of the word \"set\" precludes delegation. <i>United States v. McGlothlin,</i> 249 F.3d 783, 785 (8th Cir.2001) (\"We interpret this statement to require the district court to set a detailed payment schedule at sentencing.\"). We do not have to rule out the possibility that in some statutory settings phrases such as \"set by the court\" or \"determined by the court\" could include delegation to conclude here that the phrase \"as determined by the court\" does not permit delegation. As noted, prior to the enactment of Section 3583(d) as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, probation officers already had the authority to establish the maximum number of drug tests to be performed. If Congress wanted the courts to delegate that responsibility to probation officers, there was no need for Section 3583(d).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">There is an instructive precedent in Congress's enactment in 1996 of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. In that act, Congress amended general pre-existing language when it required courts to \"set\" the restitution payment schedule. The Eleventh Circuit found that amendment to be significant on the delegation issue:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, the predecessor statute to the MVRA, the Victims and Witness Protection Act of 1982, provided that the court could \"require that [the] defendant make restitution... within a specified period or in specified installments,\" but did not expressly state that the court must set the terms of repayment in the restitution order. By contrast, the plain language of the MVRA expressly precludes delegation of repayment scheduling to the probation office by providing that \"the length of time over which scheduled payments will be made shall be set by the court....\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3572(d)(2). This new language has removed any ambiguity that might have existed in the predecessor statute regarding the permissibility of delegating authority to determine the installment schedule.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.

The parties had previously negotiated a sales price of $12,000 per kilogram for a total of $300,000. Mel&#233;ndez agreed to finance this purchase. When Mel&#233;ndez opened the trunk of his car and showed the purported sellers a portion of the money, DEA agents arrested him and his associates. They found a Beretta 9mm pistol in his possession.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In Appeal No. 01-2397, Mel&#233;ndez committed the crimes approximately three months prior to his arrest on the charges involved in Appeal No. 01-2386. The details regarding this earlier conduct as reported in the parties' stipulated statement of facts are sparse. It appears that Mel&#233;ndez dropped an individual off at the airport who was carrying $36,000 in a bag. A search of the van that Mel&#233;ndez was driving produced approximately a kilogram of cocaine, approximately five hundred (500) grams of heroin and several weapons.

The indictment included one count of possession with intent to distribute more than five kilograms of cocaine, possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense, possession of a firearm by a convicted felon, and aiding and abetting. Mel&#233;ndez pled guilty to the drug possession and possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking offense counts on January 23, 2001. On August 21, 2001, the district court sentenced him to a term of twenty-four months on the first charge and sixty months on the second. The terms were to be served consecutively. He was also sentenced to three years of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of that sentencing hearing, Mel&#233;ndez's attorney advised the court that an information had been filed against Mel&#233;ndez in Appeal No. 01-2397, the case involving the earlier criminal conduct at the airport. In that case, the government accused him of possession with intent to distribute one kilogram of cocaine and approximately five hundred grams of heroin. Mel&#233;ndez waived his right to indictment and the preparation of a Pre-Sentence Report (PSR) and pled guilty. In exchange for his plea, the parties agreed that he would be held accountable for more than four hundred grams but less than five hundred grams of cocaine. He was sentenced during the same hearing to a term of thirty-seven months of imprisonment, to be served consecutively to the sentence in Appeal No. 01-2386. He was also sentenced to a supervised release term of four years.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez filed a timely appeal from his sentences, raising a series of challenges to the length of his sentence and to the terms of his supervised release. After a careful review of the record, we affirm part of his sentences, vacate other portions and remand for re-sentencing by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin our analysis with some background information on the supervised release system. Congress abolished the existing parole system in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, &#167; 212(a)(2), 98 Stat. 1999 (codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583 (2000)), and replaced it with a new system of \"supervised release.\" The two systems are similar in that both allow former inmates to reenter society under official control. However, under supervised release, courts, rather than the Parole Commission, are responsible for setting and enforcing the conditions of release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The United States Sentencing Guidelines generally require courts to impose a term of supervised release to follow every felony &#8212; or when otherwise required by statute &#8212; and they give the courts the option to do so in all other cases. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.1. These terms normally last one to five years. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5D1.2(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Guidelines list a series of conditions of supervised release that fall into three categories: 1) mandatory conditions that courts must include in every sentencing order; 2) standard conditions that are recommended but not required; and 3) special conditions that are not required but can be imposed under certain circumstances. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3. The seven mandatory conditions include basic correctional provisions such as \"the defendant shall not commit another federal, state or local offense,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 5D1.3(a)(1), and \"the defendant shall not unlawfully possess a controlled substance,\" <i>id.</i> &#167; 5D1.3(a)(2). The fifteen standard conditions generally relate to the defendant's responsibilities toward his probation officer. <i>See, e.g., id.</i> &#167; 5D1.3(c)(3) (\"[T]he defendant shall answer truthfully all inquiries by the probation officer and follow the instructions of the probation officer.\"). They also include rehabilitative requirements, such as a condition mandating that the defendant keep a job. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5D1.3(c)(5).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In addition to the mandatory and standard conditions, there are twelve \"special\" conditions listed in Sections 5D1.3(d) and 5D1.3(e) of the Guidelines. Section 5D1.3(d) consists of seven special conditions that are recommended in situations in which certain predicate facts are present. For example, one provision bars defendants who have been convicted of felonies or used dangerous weapons in the course of their crimes from possessing a firearm or other dangerous weapon. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5D1.3(d)(1). Other provisions mandate that the defendants participate in drug and mental health treatment programs when the court finds that such treatment is necessary. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5D1.3(d). Section 5D1.3(e) lists additional special conditions that \"may be appropriate on a case-by-case basis.\" These special conditions include a curfew, home detention and community service requirements. <i>Id.</i> &#167; 5D1.3(e).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If a released inmate violates the terms of supervised release, the court may impose serious punishments, up to and including requiring the violator to serve his release term in prison. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(3). Under certain circumstances, such as where the defendant possesses illegal drugs or refuses to comply with drug testing requirements, the court must revoke his term of supervised release and reimprison him. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(g). We turn now to Mel&#233;ndez's specific claims.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">123</span></a></span> (1991). The government charged Mel&#233;ndez in an information with possession with intent to distribute one kilogram of cocaine and 500 grams of heroin in Appeal No. 01-2397. Mel&#233;ndez waived indictment, trial, and the preparation of a Pre-sentence Report and agreed to plead guilty. Under the terms of that plea agreement, however, the parties stipulated that he would plead guilty to possession with the intent to distribute at least four hundred but less than five hundred grams of cocaine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The original offense for which Mel&#233;ndez was charged in the information carried a mandatory four-year term of supervised release, <i>see</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(B), but the offense to which he actually pled guilty only carried a statutory mandatory term of three years of supervised release. 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(b)(1)(C). The sentencing court erroneously imposed the supervised release term that accompanied the original charge.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Since the resulting sentence exceeded the Guidelines for the offense for which he actually was found guilty, <i>see</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.2(a), and since the court failed to provide advance notice of this departure, we vacate the four-year supervised release provision in Appeal No. 01-2397. We also vacate the portion of the judgment that states that Mel&#233;ndez pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute one kilogram of cocaine and five hundred grams of heroin. As noted, Mel&#233;ndez actually pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute four hundred but less than five hundred grams of cocaine, and the judgment should be corrected to reflect this fact.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. Consecutive Sentences</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez claims that the district court erroneously ordered him to serve the sentences in Appeal Nos. 01-2386 and 01-2397 consecutively. In his view, the convictions should be considered multiple counts of the same case for sentencing purposes. He contends that the offenses all involved similar conduct, that these offenses occurred only three months apart, that he was not arrested until after he had taken the actions underlying the charges in both cases, and that both cases were disposed of on the same day in the same proceeding. On this basis, he argues that his sentences should run concurrently. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.2; <i>United States v. Qui&#241;ones,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672030\"><a href=\"/opinion/672030/united-states-v-jesus-m-quinones-aka-jesus-m-quinones-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">26</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">213</span></a></span>, 217 (1st Cir.1994) (holding that a court may impose consecutive sentences for multiple-count cases only after following the accepted protocol for guideline departures).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government asserts that Mel&#233;ndez has waived this claim by failing to present it first to the district court. It also contends that, in any event, there was no plain error. As it notes, the court simply followed the parties' recommendation in their plea agreement by imposing a consecutive sentence in the second case after first securing Mel&#233;ndez's confirmation that he had agreed to the consecutive sentence.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although Mel&#233;ndez acknowledges that he agreed to the consecutive sentence, he contends that the plea agreement also stated that he would be sentenced in accordance with the Sentencing Guidelines and that the sentencing recommendation was in conflict with the Guidelines. Without case law or other support, he argues that we should resolve the conflict in favor of the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On these facts, we agree that Mel&#233;ndez has waived his claim. We also agree that there was no plain error. The record shows that Mel&#233;ndez entered into his plea agreement voluntarily and knowingly, realizing full well that he would receive the consecutive sentence that he did. In effect, Mel&#233;ndez is asking us to relieve him of his obligations under the plea agreement, even though the government has lived up to its commitments. We decline to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Conditions of Supervised Release</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez claims that the district court's imposition of conditions of supervised release included a number of procedural and substantive errors. Specifically, he claims that the court violated his Sixth Amendment right to be present at his sentencing by including a special drug treatment condition in the written sentencing orders without announcing that condition at the sentencing hearings. He also claims that the drug treatment provision constituted an impermissible delegation of judicial authority since it allowed a probation officer to determine whether he had to undergo treatment. He claims that a provision requiring him to undergo drug testing also constituted an impermissible delegation since it allowed the probation officer to decide how many drug tests he had to undergo. Finally, he claims that the court abused its discretion by requiring him to provide financial records to the probation officer, and again violated his Sixth Amendment rights by not imposing that financial records condition at one of his hearings. We will review each claim in turn.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. The Drug Treatment Condition</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mel&#233;ndez claims that the sentencing court impermissibly delegated its sentencing authority by allowing a probation officer to decide whether he might have to attend drug treatment. The condition states that if Mel&#233;ndez tests positive for drugs, \"at the discretion of the probation officer, [he shall] participate in a substance abuse treatment program arranged and approved by the probation officer until duly discharged by authorized program personnel with the approval of the probation officer.\" He also claims that since that condition was only included in the written orders setting forth the terms of supervised release but was never imposed as a condition at his sentencing hearing, the court violated his Sixth Amendment right to be present at sentencing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a.

R.Crim.P. 43(a) (\"[T]he defendant must be present at... sentencing.\"). The Supreme Court has stated that the constitutional aspect of this right is \"rooted to a large extent in the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment,\" but that it also derives from the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. <i>United States v.

Since the defendant's absence from a sentencing hearing could threaten his ability to obtain a fair and just hearing on the important issues of punishment and rehabilitation addressed at such a hearing, the Court's due process concerns in <i>Gagnon</i> are relevant to the sentencing stage of a trial. <i>See Thompson v.

The written sentencing orders in both cases stated: \"The defendant shall refrain from any unlawful use of a controlled substance and shall submit to one drug test within 15 days of release on supervised release and at least two (2) periodic drug tests thereafter, when so requested by the U.S. Probation Officer.\" The oral orders did not include the provision requiring \"at least two (2) periodic drug tests thereafter.\" The oral order in Appeal No. 01-2386 stated: \"The defendant shall refrain from any unlawful use of controlled substances and shall submit to drug testing within 15 days of release on supervised release and thereafter whenever so required by the probation officer.\" The oral order in 01-2397 was virtually identical. Therefore, pursuant to the written orders, the probation officer had to require at least two additional drug tests after the initial drug test within fifteen days of release; however, under the oral orders, the probation officer could forego any additional drug tests after the initial test. Although there is a conflict between the oral and written orders as to the number of drug tests required, we do not have to decide if this is a material conflict requiring a ruling that the oral order controls. <i>See supra</i> Section II.C.1.a. That is so because both the oral and written orders suffer from the same delegation infirmity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b.

Mel&#233;ndez claims that the inclusion of the words \"as determined by the court\" means that the court, not the probation officer, must decide how many tests a defendant should be forced to undergo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As noted, both the statute and the Guidelines state that following the initial \"drug test within 15 days of release,\" there must be \"at least 2 periodic drug tests thereafter (as determined by the court) for use of a controlled substance.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d) (2000); U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(a)(4). If there is any ambiguity in this text, it does not relate to the responsibility of the court to make the determination referenced in the statute. That responsibility could not be more explicit. But what is the determination that the court must make? The determination assigned to the court could either be the time frame for the two periodic drug tests mandated by the statute, or the number of additional drug tests to be required beyond the initial drug test within 15 days of release and the two periodic tests required by the statute. As a matter of language, the phrase \"at least\" establishes a minimum and implies that a maximum remains to be determined. As a matter of common sense, we do not think that Congress would require courts to become involved in the scheduling of drug tests. However, Congress could reasonably assign to courts the responsibility for deciding the maximum number of drug tests to be performed beyond the minimum of three mandated by Congress. <i>See United States v. Bonanno,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"755201\"><a href=\"/opinion/755201/united-states-v-frank-j-bonanno-and-lawrence-j-goldstein/\"><span class=\"volume\">146</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">502</span></a></span>, 511 (7th Cir.1998) (holding that \" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d) requires that <i>the court</i> determine the number of drug tests to which the defendants must submit\") (emphasis in original). Indeed, there is symmetry in the Congressional approach because both the statute and the Guidelines give the court the authority to waive the testing requirement completely upon a finding of \"a low risk of future substance abuse by the defendant.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3563(a)(5); U.S.S.G. &#167; 5D1.3(a)(4).

The phrase \"as determined by the court\" is unnecessary to achieve Congress's evident intent in Section 3583(d) to require courts, in the ordinary case, to require a minimum of three drug tests. Remove the language \"as determined by the court\" from Section 3583(d) and the requirement that there be a minimum of three drug tests is still there. If courts, in the exceptional case, want to disregard the requirement of Section 3583(d) that three drug tests be performed, and to order fewer or no tests, they already have that authority pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3563(a)(5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> Again, the \"as determined by the court\" language in Section 3583(d) is unnecessary to achieve the purpose attributed to it by the <i>Smith</i> Court. If this language is unnecessary to impose the requirement of three drug tests as the norm or to give courts the discretion to reduce or eliminate that minimum in exceptional cases, the \"as determined by the court\" language can only mean that the court is required to determine the maximum number of drug tests to be performed beyond the three that are required. Otherwise, the language is superfluous. <i>See, e.g., Allende v. Shultz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"505491\"><a href=\"/opinion/505491/hortensia-de-allende-v-george-p-shultz-secretary-of-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">845</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1111</span></a></span>, 1117 (1st Cir.1988) (\"`It is the duty of the court to give effect, if possible, to every clause and word of a statute, avoiding, if it may be, any construction which implies that the legislature was ignorant of the meaning of the language it employed.'\") (quoting <i>Montclair v.

This reading simply ignores the plain language of Section 3583(d), which gives the courts the responsibility to determine the maximum number of drug tests beyond three that would be required. Courts cannot fulfill this Congressionally-assigned responsibility by assigning it to probation officers. To the extent that the <i>Smith</i> Court makes a fair policy point that it is impractical to expect courts to decide years before a defendant is released \"exactly how many drug tests would be required after the defendant's release from prison,\" <i>Smith,</i> 45 F.Supp.2d. at 918, the authority of courts to set a range of drug tests to be performed pursuant to the statutory language meets this practical concern.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While it is true that, prior to the passage of the 1994 act, probation officers had discretion to order tests independently of any directive from the court, <i>see Smith,</i> 45 F.Supp.2d at 917 (noting that \"probation officers had broad discretion to administer drug tests, without specific authorization from the sentencing court\"), we conclude that Congress's refusal to include probation officers in the section of the 1994 Act that became 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d) manifests its intent to alter the existing practice. Congress explicitly referred to \"the chief probation officer in each district\" in another section of the 1994 Act and conferred upon those officers the responsibility of establishing a drug testing program. <i>See</i> Section 20414 (codified at 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3608).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> Congress clearly understood the role of probation officers in providing for and administering drug programs, yet Congress included no reference to probation officers in the drug testing language of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d); instead, it referred only to courts determining the number of drug tests. <i>See Keene Corp. v.

In practical terms, however, the distinction between the two standards of review is irrelevant to the outcome of this case since we would reach the same result under plain error review. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

Merric,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198307\"><a href=\"/opinion/198307/united-states-v-merric/\"><span class=\"volume\">166</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">406</span></a></span>, 409 (1st Cir.1999) that a court could satisfy its responsibility under a statutory provision stating \"[t]he length of time over which scheduled [fine] payments will be made shall be set by the [sentencing] court,\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3572(d)(2), by delegating that responsibility to a probation officer, <i>see id.</i> (\"conceivably, `set' could include delegation\"). However, we rejected that possibility because \"it is the inherent responsibility of the judge to determine matters of punishment and this includes final authority over all payment matters.\" <i>Id.</i> Other courts reviewing similar language have held that Congress's use of the word \"set\" precludes delegation. <i>United States v. McGlothlin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"773185\"><a href=\"/opinion/773185/united-states-v-david-lane-mcglothlin/\"><span class=\"volume\">249</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">783</span></a></span>, 785 (8th Cir.2001) (\"We interpret this statement to require the district court to set a detailed payment schedule at sentencing.\"). We do not have to rule out the possibility that in some statutory settings phrases such as \"set by the court\" or \"determined by the court\" could include delegation to conclude here that the phrase \"as determined by the court\" does not permit delegation. As noted, prior to the enactment of Section 3583(d) as part of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, probation officers already had the authority to establish the maximum number of drug tests to be performed. If Congress wanted the courts to delegate that responsibility to probation officers, there was no need for Section 3583(d).</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">There is an instructive precedent in Congress's enactment in 1996 of the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act. In that act, Congress amended general pre-existing language when it required courts to \"set\" the restitution payment schedule. The Eleventh Circuit found that amendment to be significant on the delegation issue:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">In contrast, the predecessor statute to the MVRA, the Victims and Witness Protection Act of 1982, provided that the court could \"require that [the] defendant make restitution... within a specified period or in specified installments,\" but did not expressly state that the court must set the terms of repayment in the restitution order. By contrast, the plain language of the MVRA expressly precludes delegation of repayment scheduling to the probation office by providing that \"the length of time over which scheduled payments will be made shall be set by the court....\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3572(d)(2). This new language has removed any ambiguity that might have existed in the predecessor statute regarding the permissibility of delegating authority to determine the installment schedule.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v.
