Fletcher, of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by\ndesignation.\n\f             B. FLETCHER, Senior Circuit Judge. David Johnson appeals\n\nhis conviction on three felony counts.      A jury found him guilty of\n\npossession of crack cocaine with the intent to distribute, being a\n\nfelon in possession of a firearm and ammunition, and being a felon\n\nin possession of a firearm in furtherance of a drug trafficking\n\ncrime.   He argues that the trial court should have suppressed\n\nevidence obtained from a search of his car, and should not have\n\nallowed the prosecution to cross-examine him regarding his prior\n\nfelony convictions.    Because we find that the search of his car was\n\nproper, and that the court's error in allowing him to be cross-\n\nexamined on his prior convictions was harmless, we affirm.\n\nI.   FACTS\n\n             Appellant Johnson was driving a rental car in a high\n\ncrime area in Roxbury at 2:30 a.m.      The car stopped for 90 seconds\n\nin the middle of a street.    Plainclothes officers Lewis and Streat\n\nwaited behind it in an unmarked car for about 60 seconds.         The\n\nofficers testified that the car's dome lights were on, and that\n\nboth occupants were using cell phones.        Johnson's car continued\n\ndown the street and turned into a narrow private driveway, where it\n\nstopped. Its motor was running, its brake lights were on, and both\n\noccupants were talking on cell phones. The parties dispute whether\n\nJohnson's door was open or closed at this time.\n\n             The officers approached the vehicle on foot to conduct a\n\n\"Field Interrogation Observation Report\" (\"FIO\") -- a threshold\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\finquiry to see if there was some problem, otherwise referred to as\n\na Terry stop.    They had made many arrests in the area, and because\n\na car parked in the middle of a street was unusual, they sought to\n\nquestion the occupants to ensure that everything was all right.\n\nThe officers testified that they typically conducted an FIO when\n\nstopping an individual or a car in a high crime area.              Unknown to\n\nthe officers, the driveway led to the residence of Johnson's\n\npassenger, Calhoun.      No obstacles blocked the officers' access to\n\nthe driveway, and they entered it.\n\n             Officer Lewis stood behind the driver's side of the car\n\nfor 30 to 45 seconds, before Johnson saw him.              Lewis identified\n\nhimself   as    an   officer   and    asked   for    Johnson's   license   and\n\nregistration. The beam of his flashlight then illuminated a bundle\n\nof bags of crack cocaine in the map compartment of Johnson's door.\n\nLewis testified that after he ordered Johnson out of the car,\n\nJohnson turned off the ignition and transferred the keys to his\n\nleft hand.     As Johnson tried to reach under the driver's seat with\n\nhis right hand, Lewis pulled him away.          A handgun was later found\n\nunder the seat.      Johnson claimed that he had merely been putting\n\naway his wallet. Johnson reached further under the seat, and Lewis\n\npulled him out of the car.           A struggle ensued as Lewis tried to\n\nkeep   Johnson    from   reentering     the   car.      Calhoun,   the   car's\n\npassenger, exited the car, entered the yard, and unleashed a pit\n\nbull on Officer Streat.        Streat held the dog at bay at gunpoint\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\funtil Calhoun returned it to the yard, and then Streat and Calhoun\n\nstruggled as well.       These struggles ended only when backup units\n\narrived.\n\n            At trial, over Johnson's timely and renewed objections,\n\nthe government cross-examined Johnson about at least five of his\n\nprior drug-related convictions.      Before taking the stand, Johnson\n\nmoved in limine to suppress this evidence, and the trial judge\n\nstated that he would let the prosecution use \"whatever should come\n\nin under the rule.\"      He required the prosecution to provide a list\n\nof   the   convictions   it   intended   to   use   along   with   citations\n\nauthorizing their admissibility to help him rule as to whether they\n\ndid address credibility.       He noted that he always went back and\n\nlooked at Rule 609 due to its number of layers.        When Johnson again\n\nmoved to suppress this evidence prior to his taking the stand, the\n\ntrial judge demurred, saying that the prosecutor had done \"just\n\nwhat I asked him to, be specific about what was going to be\n\noffered.\"    When Johnson once more moved to suppress just prior to\n\nhis cross-examination, the trial judge accepted the prosecutor's\n\nadvice that Rule 609 did not require him to find explicitly on the\n\nrecord that the probative value of the evidence exceeded its\n\nprejudicial effect, but that he could do so implicitly.             He then\n\ncut short Johnson's objections, ruling \"Okay, I think I understand\n\nand I am going to let them in.\"          Johnson was sentenced to 262\n\nmonths in jail on the first two counts, with a 60 month sentence\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\ffor the third count to be served consecutively.\n\n                         II.   LEGAL ANALYSIS\n\nA.   Jurisdiction\n\n           This court has jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 1291.\n\n\n\nB. Motion to Suppress Evidence from Search\n\n           1.   Standard of review\n\n           Factual findings underlying a district court's denial of\n\na motion to suppress evidence are reviewed for clear error, and its\n\ndeterminations of law are reviewed de novo.     U.S. v. Marenghi, 109\n\nF.3d 28, 31 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n           2.   Merits of the motion to suppress\n\n           The officers did not know that the driveway where the car\n\nstood led to Calhoun's residence. Further, the car was clearly not\n\nwithin the residence's curtilage.       In light of the stop in the\n\nmiddle of the street late at night, the officers had a reasonable\n\nand articulable basis to conduct a Terry stop. While Johnson\n\nasserts that the officers had no right to leave the public street\n\nand enter a driveway to do so, if a reasonable expectation of\n\nprivacy could be asserted here, it would belong only to Calhoun,\n\nwho resided at the property.    See Minnesota v. Carter, 525 U.S. 83,\n\n88-91 (1998). Johnson had no standing to claim a privacy interest.\n\n           The trial court found that Johnson's car door was open\n\nwhen Officer Lewis approached the car, and that this allowed Lewis\n\n                                  -5-\n\fto see the bags of crack cocaine in the pocket of the car door.\n\nThis finding was not clear error.               Upon his seeing the bags, Lewis\n\nhad probable cause to arrest Johnson, and then to search the car,\n\nwhere the officers found the gun.                The bags of crack cocaine and\n\nthe gun, therefore, are not subject to suppression.\n\nC. Motion to Suppress Evidence of Prior Felony Convictions\n\n             1.    Standard of review\n\n             We    review     whether    the     probative   value   of    a   prior\n\nconviction        outweighs    its      prejudicial    effect    for      abuse    of\n\ndiscretion.        United States v. Tracy, 36 F.3d 187, 193 (1st Cir.\n\n1994).\n\n             2.    Violation of Fed. R. Evid. 609(a)(1)\n\n             Johnson asserts that the court violated Federal Rule of\n\nEvidence 609 by admitting evidence about his prior convictions of\n\nfelonies despite his offer to stipulate to the fact of felony\n\nstatus.   He relies on Old Chief v. United States, 519 U.S. 172, 191\n\n(1997).     Assuming arguendo that this argument has merit, we hold\n\nthat any erroneous admission of evidence was harmless.                            \"[A]\n\nnonconstitutional evidentiary issue will be treated as harmless if\n\nit is highly probable that the evidence did not contribute to the\n\nverdict.\"     United States v. Shea, 159 F.3d 37, 40 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(quoting United States v. Rose, 104 F.3d 1408, 1414 (1st Cir.\n\n1997)).      Here, Officer Lewis's testimony was straightforward,\n\nbelievable, and damning.             Johnson's testimony -- that he didn't\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fknow that the drugs and gun were in the car, that he kept slipping\n\nwhen still in the car and did not intend to reach for the gun or\n\nfight Officer Lewis -- was not credible.        Had the trial judge ruled\n\noptimally, the jury would still have known that Johnson had been\n\nconvicted   of   several   felonies,     but   not   the   nature   of   those\n\nfelonies.    At best, from Johnson's perspective, jurors would have\n\nknown that he had been convicted of a felony.               Given the other\n\nevidence, we cannot say that the jury was appreciably less likely\n\nto have acquitted Johnson had it not known the nature of his prior\n\nconvictions.\n\n                           III.   CONCLUSION\n\n            The trial court correctly admitted evidence obtained from\n\nthe search of Johnson's car.       The officers had a reasonable and\n\narticulable suspicion to warrant their approaching the car in the\n\ndriveway, and probable cause for arrest once they viewed the bags\n\nof crack cocaine in the car's open door.             Even though the trial\n\ncourt may have erred in allowing cross-examination on Johnson's\n\nprior felony convictions, any trial court error was harmless given\n\nthe overwhelming evidence against Johnson.           Accordingly, we affirm\n\nappellant Johnson's convictions on both charges.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f",

Assuming arguendo that this argument has merit, we hold\n\nthat any erroneous admission of evidence was harmless.                            \"[A]\n\nnonconstitutional evidentiary issue will be treated as harmless if\n\nit is highly probable that the evidence did not contribute to the\n\nverdict.\"     United States v. Shea, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198187\"><a href=\"/opinion/198187/united-states-v-shea/\"><span class=\"volume\">159</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 40 (1st Cir. 1998)\n\n(quoting United States v.

Here, Officer Lewis's testimony was straightforward,\n\nbelievable, and damning.             Johnson's testimony -- that he didn't\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fknow that the drugs and gun were in the car, that he kept slipping\n\nwhen still in the car and did not intend to reach for the gun or\n\nfight Officer Lewis -- was not credible.        Had the trial judge ruled\n\noptimally, the jury would still have known that Johnson had been\n\nconvicted   of   several   felonies,     but   not   the   nature   of   those\n\nfelonies.    At best, from Johnson's perspective, jurors would have\n\nknown that he had been convicted of a felony.               Given the other\n\nevidence, we cannot say that the jury was appreciably less likely\n\nto have acquitted Johnson had it not known the nature of his prior\n\nconvictions.\n\n                           III.   CONCLUSION\n\n            The trial court correctly admitted evidence obtained from\n\nthe search of Johnson's car.       The officers had a reasonable and\n\narticulable suspicion to warrant their approaching the car in the\n\ndriveway, and probable cause for arrest once they viewed the bags\n\nof crack cocaine in the car's open door.             Even though the trial\n\ncourt may have erred in allowing cross-examination on Johnson's\n\nprior felony convictions, any trial court error was harmless given\n\nthe overwhelming evidence against Johnson.           Accordingly, we affirm\n\nappellant Johnson's convictions on both charges.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -7-\n\f</pre>",
