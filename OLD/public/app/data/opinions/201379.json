This case is before us for a\n\nsecond time — but with the parties' roles reversed.                   In its first\n\niteration, a panel of this court set aside the district court's\n\nentry of judgment n.o.v. for the defendants and reinstated guilty\n\nverdicts returned by the jury.               See United States v. Moran, 312\n\nF.3d    480    (1st   Cir.    2002)    (Moran    I).     The    district     court\n\nsubsequently declared untimely the defendants' belated efforts to\n\nsecure a new trial and imposed sentence.                  The defendants now\n\nappeal.\n\n              This time around, we are asked to reconsider the original\n\npanel decision; to reverse the district court's determination that\n\nthe defendants did not file a timeous motion for new trial; and to\n\ngrant relief from the judgments of conviction on the ground that\n\nthe defendants were burdened by ineffective assistance of counsel.\n\nIn addition, the defendants advance, for the first time, claims of\n\ninstructional       error    and    prosecutorial   misconduct.         We   reject\n\noutright the vast majority of these animadversions.                     As to the\n\nineffective      assistance        claims,    however,   we    find    the   record\n\ninsufficient to rule definitively, and so dismiss those claims\n\nwithout prejudice to their renewal in proceedings under 28 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2255.\n\nI.     BACKGROUND\n\n              We sketch the facts of the offenses of conviction,\n\nreferring the reader who hungers for more exegetic detail to our\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fearlier opinion.    See Moran I, 312 F.3d at 482-87.          Following the\n\nestablished praxis, we rehearse these facts in the light most\n\ncompatible with the verdicts. See, e.g., United States v. Hussein,\n\n351 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n           In October of 1986, John M. Moran, an attorney who\n\nrepresented, inter alios, First American Bank for Savings, met with\n\nEdgar Puente and David Boersner, aspiring real estate developers,\n\nwho were seeking financing for a pair of projects in Boston,\n\nMassachusetts.     The developers hired Mr. Moran as their mortgage\n\nbroker and agreed to pay him 1.5% of the face amount of any loans\n\nthat he procured on their behalf.         Mr. Moran arranged a meeting\n\nbetween the developers and a First American loan officer, Edmund\n\nNoke,   during   which   Noke   agreed   to   lend   Puente   and   Boersner\n\n$17,000,000.     Following this meeting, the developers agreed that\n\nMr. Moran would receive a 20% profit interest in the two projects.\n\nHis wife, Nora F. Moran — who sat on the board of directors of\n\nFirst American — created the Moran Development Group Trust (MDG\n\nTrust) to hold the equity interest and named herself sole trustee.\n\nUnder state law, the identity of the beneficiaries of the MDG Trust\n\nwas not a matter of public record.\n\n           In November of 1986, Mr. Moran submitted formal loan\n\nproposals to First American on behalf of Puente and Boersner.             He\n\ndisclosed neither his 20% profit interest nor his anticipated 1.5%\n\nbrokerage fee, even though he was duty bound to do so.                 First\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\fAmerican's executive committee approved the loans in December, and\n\nthe bank designated Mr. Moran as its closing attorney.                Mr. Moran\n\nconducted    the   closing,   charged     the   bank    handsomely     for   his\n\nservices, and (unbeknownst to the bank) collected $255,000 from the\n\ndevelopers.     He never submitted the customary settlement sheets,\n\nwhich would have detailed the use of the loan proceeds (and, thus,\n\nwould have revealed his conflicted interests).\n\n            The record indicates that the Puente/Boersner loans were\n\namong 153     loans   approved   that   month   by     the   bank's   executive\n\ncommittee.    The committee considered those loans for approval in\n\ntwo groups.    The first vote approved a block of 140 loans, and the\n\nsecond approved the remaining 13.         The Puente/Boersner loans were\n\npart of the second (smaller) lot.         The executive committee sent a\n\nreport of its December activities to the bank's board of directors,\n\nbut only provided details as to the first batch of loans.\n\n            In January 1987, the board of directors, including Mrs.\n\nMoran, met to consider the December report.             The parties fiercely\n\ncontest exactly what transpired at that meeting.             The government's\n\nversion, disputed by the defendants, is that Mrs. Moran voted\n\neither to ratify or approve the Puente/Boersner loans instead of\n\ndisqualifying herself due to her and her husband's financial\n\ninterests. Whatever happened that day, it is clear that Mrs. Moran\n\nnever disclosed to First American the Morans' financial interests\n\nin the loans.\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\f              By   1988,    the    Puente/Boersner      loans     were   underwater.\n\nSpurred by the prospect of a substantial loss, First American began\n\nan   investigation         that    would   eventually        uncover   the   manifold\n\nirregularities surrounding the loans and the Morans' interests in\n\nthem.       In a meeting with First American's outside counsel, Mrs.\n\nMoran admitted that she knew about her husband's financial stake at\n\nthe time the loans were approved.                For his part, Mr. Moran claimed\n\nthat he had fully recounted his conflicted interests to Noke.                     The\n\nbank's records did not reflect any such disclosure.\n\n              Even though the Puente/Boersner loans eventually soured\n\nand the bank failed, the saga continued.                       On July 9, 1997, a\n\nfederal grand jury indicted the Morans for, inter alia, committing\n\nbank fraud by failing to disclose their financial interests in the\n\nPuente/Boersner projects, 18 U.S.C. § 1344, aiding and abetting\n\nbank fraud, id. § 2, and conspiring to commit bank fraud, id. §\n\n371.1       Trial commenced on May 17, 1999.                 As to Mr. Moran, the\n\ngovernment introduced evidence describing his fiduciary duties to\n\nthe bank.      It also adduced evidence showing that the paperwork he\n\nhad submitted       to     First    American     did   not    disclose   either   the\n\nbrokerage or profit-sharing arrangements.                Finally, Noke testified\n\nthat Mr. Moran never divulged his economic stake in the development\n\n\n        1\n      The indictment contained a second, unrelated count of bank\nfraud against Mrs. Moran. The district court granted her motion\nfor judgment of acquittal as to that count at the close of the\ngovernment's case in chief, Moran I, 312 F.3d at 485-86, and we\neschew any further reference to it.\n\n                                           -6-\n\fprojects and stated that such a revelation would have led to the\n\nfiling of an insider transaction report.               The government then\n\nshowed that no such report appeared in the bank's archives.\n\n               The government's case against Mrs. Moran was thinner. It\n\ndid,       however,   introduce   evidence   limning   her   regulatory   and\n\nfiduciary duties and showing that she was involved in various ways\n\nwith the Puente/Boersner loans (e.g., she had visited the sites\n\nduring a pre-loan inspection, had created the MDG Trust and named\n\nherself as trustee, and was generally privy to her husband's\n\nfinancial dealings).         The government also proved that Mrs. Moran\n\nhad failed to apprise her fellow board members about the Morans'\n\nfinancial interests in the Puente/Boersner projects.2\n\n               The defense moved for judgment of acquittal following the\n\nclose of the government's case in chief.          Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(a).\n\nThe district court denied the motions.           During the defense case,\n\nMr. Moran testified that he had made full disclosure to Noke.             Mrs.\n\nMoran did not testify.            The government presented one rebuttal\n\nwitness. At the close of all the evidence, the defense again moved\n\nfor judgment of acquittal.         The district court reserved decision,\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 29(b), and the jury found the defendants guilty on\n\nall the submitted counts.\n\n\n       2\n      As mentioned above, the government tried to show that, on\nJanuary 15, 1987, Mrs. Moran had voted to ratify or approve the\nPuente/Boersner loans, instead of disqualifying herself from the\nvote. The Moran I panel did not rely on this evidence, see 312\nF.3d at 492, and we do not dwell on it at this juncture.\n\n                                      -7-\n\f            The verdicts were recorded on July 14, 1999, and judgment\n\nentered on that date.        The next day, the Morans filed a renewed\n\nmotion for judgment of acquittal.          See Fed. R. Crim. P. 29(c).        The\n\ndistrict court granted the Morans an extension of time within which\n\nto file supplemental memoranda.           On September 15, each defendant\n\nfiled a supplemental memorandum that asked the court, among other\n\nthings, to treat the joint July 15 motion, in the alternative, as\n\na motion for new trial under Fed. R. Crim. P. 33.               The government\n\nopposed both the motion for judgment of acquittal and the requests\n\nfor conversion.     The district court pondered the matter at length.3\n\nOn July 13, 2000, it granted the motion for judgment of acquittal\n\nwithout addressing the conversion requests.\n\n            The government appealed from this ruling.             We reversed.\n\nMoran I, 312 F.3d at 494.      As to Mr. Moran, we found ample evidence\n\nto support the verdict:          he had a plain duty to disclose his\n\nsharply    conflicted   financial       interests   to   the    bank,   and   his\n\ntestimony that he had made the disclosure allowed the jury, based\n\non credibility and demeanor, to disbelieve him and credit Noke's\n\ncontrary testimony.        Id. at 490-91.      To buttress that permissible\n\nfinding,    the   record    supported    the   conclusion      that   Mr.   Moran\n\n\n\n     3\n      In October of 1999, the defendants jointly filed a separate\nmotion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence\n(specifically, alleged juror misconduct). That motion was timely.\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(b)(1). However, the district court denied\nit on December 27, 1999. On appeal, the defendants do not attempt\nto challenge that ruling.\n\n                                     -8-\n\fintentionally failed to disclose the information in order to gain\n\na financial advantage.        Id. at 491.   \"In sum, there was sufficient\n\nevidence to allow a rational jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable\n\ndoubt, that . . . Moran concealed his financial arrangements with\n\nPuente and Boersner . . . pursuant to an affirmative endeavor\n\ncalculated to defraud First American.\"          Id. at 491-92.\n\n           As to Mrs. Moran, we found that although the government's\n\ntheory that she had voted to ratify or approve the Puente/Boersner\n\nloans did not pass muster, see supra note 2, there were other,\n\nindependently sufficient grounds for upholding the verdict. Id. at\n\n492.   Specifically, the government had presented adequate evidence\n\nto allow a rational jury to conclude that Mrs. Moran, \"aware of her\n\nhusband's outside dealings and arrangements concerning the projects\n\nprior to the consummation of the transactions at issue, chose not\n\nto disclose the conflicts . . . because she anticipated that a\n\nfinancial windfall would accrue to her husband (and by extension to\n\nher) should the loans be approved.\"              Id.       We also discerned\n\nsignificant evidence that Mrs. Moran had aided and abetted her\n\nhusband's scheme:     she accompanied her husband on an inspection of\n\nthe properties before the loan applications were submitted; she\n\ncreated   the   MDG   Trust    two   days   before   the    bank's   executive\n\ncommittee approved the loans; and she named herself as trustee\n\ninstead of Mr. Moran's secretary (as was their custom).               Id.   We\n\nalso observed that Mrs. Moran regularly shared financial matters\n\n\n                                      -9-\n\fwith her husband and that she was, in her own right, \"an astute\n\nreal estate broker and bank director familiar with the affirmative\n\nduties of disclosure.\"      Id. at 492.   Taken as a whole, this\n\nevidence sufficed for a rational jury to convict Mrs. Moran of both\n\nbank fraud and conspiracy.     Id. at 493-94.   Chief Judge Boudin\n\njoined in the reinstatement of the convictions but wrote separately\n\nto suggest that the thinness of the evidence against Mrs. Moran\n\nprobably would support an order granting her a new trial if the\n\ndistrict court found that she had timely sought that anodyne.   Id.\n\nat 495-96 (Boudin, C.J., concurring).\n\n          On remand, the Morans moved for a hearing on their\n\noutstanding requests to convert their Rule 29 motion into a Rule 33\n\nmotion.   The government filed an opposition.   The district court\n\nrebuffed the conversion requests, ruling that the defendants had\n\nnot seasonably moved for a new trial.      The court proceeded to\n\npronounce sentence.   These timely appeals followed.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           We divide our analysis into several discrete segments,\n\ncorresponding with the variety of the defendants' arguments.\n\n                       A.   Law of the Case.\n\n          We start with Mrs. Moran's explicit beseechment that we\n\nrevisit and repudiate the prior panel opinion.      The government\n\ncounters that we are without the power to conduct such a review\n\nunder the law of the case doctrine and that, in all events, the\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fpredecessor panel got it right.       We give each side half a loaf.        On\n\nthe one hand, we agree with Mrs. Moran that, as a theoretical\n\nmatter, we have some authority — albeit limited authority — to\n\nreexamine our earlier decision.        On the other hand, we agree with\n\nthe government that the circumstances at hand do not warrant\n\ndisplacing the earlier ruling.\n\n            The law of the case doctrine \"posits that when a court\n\ndecides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern\n\nthe same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\"            Arizona v.\n\nCalifornia, 460 U.S. 605, 618 (1983).                The doctrine has two\n\nbranches.     The   first   branch    —     the   mandate   rule   —   prevents\n\nrelitigation in the trial court of matters that were explicitly or\n\nimplicitly decided by an earlier appellate decision in the same\n\ncase.   United States v. Vigneau, 337 F.3d 62, 67 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nThe second branch contemplates that a legal decision made at one\n\nstage of a criminal or civil proceeding should remain the law of\n\nthat case throughout the litigation, unless and until the decision\n\nis modified or overruled by a higher court.             See Christianson v.\n\nColt Indus. Oper'g Corp., 486 U.S. 800, 816-17 (1988). That branch\n\nbinds, for example, a successor appellate panel in a second appeal\n\nin the same case, see Cohen v. Brown Univ., 101 F.3d 155, 167-68\n\n(1st Cir. 1996), and a successor trial judge who steps in to\n\ncomplete a pending case, see Flibotte v. Pa. Truck Lines, Inc., 131\n\nF.3d 21, 24-25 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n\n                                     -11-\n\f            We are dealing here with the second branch of the law of\n\nthe case doctrine.      That branch is prudential and, accordingly, is\n\nmore flexible than the first.           We recently catalogued several\n\nsituations in which a court might appropriately reconsider its past\n\ndecision.    See Ellis v. United States, 313 F.3d 636, 647-48 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).     Mrs. Moran asseverates that this case comes within\n\nthat   taxonomy    as   a   case   in   which   \"reconsideration    may   be\n\nappropriate to avoid manifest injustice.\"          Id. at 648.\n\n            While Ellis recognized this exception — and we reaffirm\n\nits vitality — a litigant seeking to fit within its confines must\n\nnegotiate a steep uphill climb.            In this context, a finding of\n\nmanifest injustice requires, at a bare minimum, \"a definite and\n\nfirm conviction that a prior ruling on a material matter is\n\nunreasonable or obviously wrong,\" and resulted in prejudice.              Id.\n\nat 648 & n.5.     Mrs. Moran cannot scale these heights.\n\n            In mounting her argument, Mrs. Moran relies exclusively\n\non Chief Judge Boudin's concurring opinion in Moran I.             What she\n\nseemingly fails to appreciate is that even the author of that\n\nconcurrence concluded that there was sufficient evidence upon which\n\nto ground a conviction.      Moran I, 312 F.3d at 495-96 (Boudin, C.J.,\n\nconcurring).      That conclusion is antithetic to Mrs. Moran's claim\n\nthat the concurrence necessitates (or even supports) a finding that\n\nthe earlier panel opinion was, in the Ellis phrase, \"unreasonable\n\nor obviously wrong.\"        Ellis, 313 F.3d at 648.     Since Mrs. Moran\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fpoints to no other authority to support such a finding, there is no\n\nbasis for suspecting manifest injustice here. We therefore decline\n\nMrs. Moran's invitation to disturb the decision in Moran I.\n\n                    B.   The Attempted Conversion.\n\n            A motion for a new trial in a federal criminal case,\n\nother than a motion alleging newly discovered evidence, must be\n\nfiled within     seven   days   next   following   the   initial   entry   of\n\njudgment.     Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(b)(2).       Mr. Moran filed no such\n\nmotion within the allotted interval. In an endeavor to repair this\n\nomission, he asseverates that the defendants' timely motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal should have been considered \"alternatively\"\n\nas a motion for new trial and that, therefore, the district court\n\nshould have converted that Rule 29 motion into a Rule 33 motion for\n\na new trial.4    This asseveration is hopeless.\n\n            The motion to which Mr. Moran alludes was captioned\n\n\"Motion[] for Judgment of Acquittal and for Additional Time to File\n\nMemoranda.\"     The body of the motion reads in relevant part:\n\n                   NOW COME defendants John and Nora\n            Moran, through counsel, and pursuant to Rule\n            29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure\n            and hereby renew their motions for this\n            Honorable Court to enter a judgment of\n            acquittal as to all counts of the Superseding\n            Indictment.    In support thereof, counsel\n            states the following:\n\n                                   . . .\n\n\n     4\n      Although the Morans jointly filed the motion for judgment of\nacquittal, Mrs. Moran does not pursue this line of argument.\n\n                                   -13-\n\f                 6.   . . . [T]he government failed to\n          offer sufficient evidence upon which a\n          rational jury could find the Defendants guilty\n          beyond a reasonable doubt of the crimes of\n          bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank\n          fraud.\n\n                 7.   The  government's  evidence  is\n          equally consistent with guilt as it is with\n          innocence which requires a judgment of\n          acquittal.\n\n                 8.    Assuming   arguendo    that   the\n          government established that the Defendants\n          violated bank policy and/or civil banking\n          regulations,    the   government   failed   to\n          introduce any other conduct which may form the\n          basis for a bank fraud conviction.\n\n                 9.   The government has failed to prove\n          intent on the part of the Defendants.\n\n                 10. Assuming    arguendo  that   the\n          government has proven that the Defendants\n          intended to defraud First American Bank, it\n          failed to prove that their statements or\n          omissions were material.\n\n          WHEREFORE, based upon the foregoing arguing\n          [sic] arguments and authorities this Honorable\n          Court is respectfully urged to permit the\n          Defendants additional time to file memoranda\n          in support of the instant motion and to enter\n          a judgment of acquittal as to all counts of\n          the Superseding Indictment.\n\nMr. Moran suggests that this motion was sufficient to permit a\n\njudge to grant him a new trial based on the following syllogism:\n\n(i) the substance of a motion, not its title, controls; (ii) a\n\nmotion pointing   out   that   the   government   did   not   have   enough\n\nevidence to convict a defendant, a priori, supports a claim that\n\nthe weight of the evidence tipped greatly in the defendant's favor;\n\n                                 -14-\n\f(iii) such a weight-of-the-evidence finding would support the\n\ngranting of a new trial; and so (iv) a motion seeking judgment of\n\nacquittal because of insufficient evidence — like Mr. Moran's\n\nmotion — \"logically\" must encompass a request for a new trial.\n\n             Taken   in   the   abstract,    some    of   these    premises   are\n\ncorrect. For example, we have stated that \"[i]n addressing a post-\n\njudgment motion, a court is not bound by the label that the movant\n\nfastens to it\" and may \"reclassify the motion as its substance\n\nsuggests.\"     Vasapolli v. Rostoff, 39 F.3d 27, 36 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\nSo too a timely motion for new trial may be granted when \"evidence\n\npreponderates heavily against the verdict.\"                  United States v.\n\nWilkerson, 251 F.3d 273, 278 (1st Cir. 2001) (internal quotation\n\nmarks omitted).      But two swallows do not a summer make, and Mr.\n\nMoran's syllogism falls apart when one analyzes its conclusion:\n\nthat a motion seeking a judgment of acquittal on sufficiency-of-\n\nthe-evidence grounds necessarily must be read as requesting a\n\nconsolation prize in the nature of a new trial.\n\n          That reading is neither logically compelled nor legally\n\nappropriate. Where the motion papers cannot be fairly construed as\n\na request for a new trial, a district court does not have the\n\nauthority,    sua    sponte,    to   convert   a    motion   for   judgment    of\n\nacquittal into a motion for a new trial.            United States v. Navarro\n\nViayra, 365 F.3d 790, 793 (9th Cir. 2004); United States v. Brown,\n\n587 F.2d 187, 189 (5th Cir. 1979).           That choice is the defendant's\n\n\n                                      -15-\n\f— and the defendant's alone.           What is more, it must be exercised\n\nwithin the time parameters prescribed by the Criminal Rules.\n\n              As said, Fed. R. Crim. P. 33(b)(2) specifies that a\n\nmotion for new trial, other than a motion grounded on newly\n\ndiscovered evidence, must be filed within seven days of the jury\n\nverdict (i.e., the entry of judgment).            That rule was amended in\n\n1966 to \"make it clear that a judge has no power to order a new\n\ntrial on his own motion\" once judgment has entered.            Fed. R. Crim.\n\nP. 33 advisory committee notes (1966 Amendments).            Simultaneously,\n\nthe advisory committee made it pellucid that the Criminal Rules\n\nforbid an interpretation that would allow a district court, on its\n\nown initiative, to evade the temporal strictures of Rule 33 by\n\nreading into a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal a request\n\nfor a new trial, not solicited by the movant.           See Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n29 advisory committee notes (1966 Amendments, Subdivision (c))\n\n(explaining that Rule 29(c) precludes an interpretation that \"gives\n\nthe [district] court power to order a new trial even though the\n\ndefendant . . . has not asked for one\").\n\n              Viewed against this backdrop, it is transparently clear\n\nthat   even    if   a   motion   for   judgment   of   acquittal   contains   a\n\nsubstantive basis sufficient to ground the grant of a new trial, a\n\ncourt is without power to treat the motion as a motion for a new\n\ntrial unless it also contains some overt indication that the movant\n\ndesires that relief.        The motion in this case contained no such\n\n\n                                       -16-\n\findication.   It invoked Rule 29, not Rule 33, and the only relief\n\nrequested was an outright acquittal.    It was not until September\n\n15, 1999 — well beyond the seven-day deadline — that Mr. Moran\n\ninformed the district court of his desire for a new trial.     That\n\nwas too late.5\n\n          That disposes of this assignment of error.    The Criminal\n\nRules gave Mr. Moran seven days within which to move for a new\n\ntrial.   He failed to seek that relief, and his timely motion for\n\njudgment of acquittal did not fill the void.     Consequently, the\n\ndistrict court acted appropriately both in denying Mr. Moran's\n\nbelated conversion request and in refusing to grant a new trial.\n\n              C.   Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.\n\n          The defendants next claim that the failure of their trial\n\nattorneys to file timely new trial motions constitutes ineffective\n\nassistance of counsel and, as such, justifies retrial. This claim,\n\nraised for the first time in this venue, is premature.\n\n\n\n\n     5\n      Mr. Moran's citation to United States v. Baker, 432 F.2d 994\n(10th Cir. 1970) (per curiam), is of little value. Baker states,\nwithout analysis, that the motion for judgment of acquittal filed\nby the defendant in that case \"should be construed as containing\nallegations sufficient to constitute a motion for new trial.\" Id.\nat 995. The court neither described the contents of the motion nor\nexplained what relief the defendant had sought. To the extent that\nBaker suggests that a district court can grant a new trial sua\nsponte after the entry of judgment in a criminal case, without a\ntimely indication from the defendant that he desires one, its\nholding is flatly inconsistent with the Criminal Rules and, like\nthe Ninth Circuit, see Navarro Viayra, 365 F.3d at 795, we\nrespectfully decline to follow it.\n\n                               -17-\n\f             \"We   have    held   with   a    regularity    bordering   on   the\n\nmonotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance\n\ncannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions,\n\nbut, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by,\n\nthe trial court.\"         United States v. Mala, 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st\n\nCir. 1993) (collecting cases).           This rule is prudential in nature.\n\nA claim of ineffective assistance requires a showing that the\n\nattorney turned in a constitutionally deficient performance that\n\nprejudiced the defendant's substantial rights.               See Strickland v.\n\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984); United States v. Martinez-\n\nVargas, 321 F.3d 245, 251 (1st Cir. 2003).                 Claims of this sort\n\n\"typically require the resolution of factual issues that cannot\n\nefficaciously be addressed in the first instance by an appellate\n\ntribunal.\"    Mala, 7 F.3d at 1063.          In addition, the insights of the\n\ntrier, who has seen and heard the witnesses at first hand and\n\nwatched the dynamics of the trial unfold, are often of great\n\nassistance.    See, e.g., United States v. Fish, 34 F.3d 488, 494 n.4\n\n(7th Cir. 1994); United States v. McGill, 952 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir.\n\n1991).\n\n             This is such a case.         No ineffective assistance claim\n\nsurfaced in the district court, and the record is barren of\n\nevidence as to why the lawyers did what they did.               There are both\n\ntactical and strategic reasons why a party might seek a judgment of\n\nacquittal but not a new trial (for example, a fear that the\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fprosecution     will   learn    from    its    mistakes       and   put    in   a   more\n\npersuasive      case   the     second    time       around,    a    fear    that     the\n\ndecisionmaker will take a request for acquittal less seriously if\n\na possible compromise — such as a new trial — is on the table, or\n\na fear that a shift in judges will lead to a stiffer sentence).\n\nAlthough hindsight is always 20/20, we cannot tell from this record\n\nwhether the decision not to seek a new trial, when made, was a\n\ncalculated stratagem or a mere oversight.                     Factfinding will be\n\nrequired to make that determination, which means that the district\n\ncourt should hear the claim in the first instance.                         See, e.g.,\n\nMcGill, 952 F.2d at 19.\n\n              We add, moreover, that even if the failure to ask for a\n\nnew   trial    betokens      objectively      unreasonable         (and,   therefore,\n\nconstitutionally deficient) performance on the part of the lawyers\n\n— a matter on which we take no view — it remains to be determined\n\nwhether any such failure was prejudicial within the meaning of\n\nStrickland. A finding of prejudice here would require a subsidiary\n\nfinding that, but for the error, the moving defendant probably\n\nwould have received a new trial.           See, e.g., Flores v. Demskie, 215\n\nF.3d 293, 305 (2d Cir. 2000).           That question is not open and shut.\n\nEach defendant must independently demonstrate that, given the\n\nholding of      this   court    in   Moran     I,    an   objectively      reasonable\n\n\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\fdistrict court would likely have granted a new trial.6        See Butcher\n\nv. United States, 368 F.3d 1290, 1294-95 (11th Cir. 2004); Ouber v.\n\nGuarino, 293 F.3d 19, 32-33, 33 n.10 (1st Cir. 2002).            The nisi\n\nprius court is the proper forum in which the defendants may attempt\n\nto make this showing.\n\n          For     these     reasons,   we   decline   to   entertain   the\n\nineffective assistance claims here and now.           Instead, we dismiss\n\nthem without prejudice to their reassertion, should the defendants\n\nso choose, in proceedings under 28 U.S.C. § 2255.\n\n             D.    Miscellaneous Assignments of Error.\n\n          There are two other issues lurking at the periphery of\n\nthese appeals:      both defendants argue that the district court\n\nincorrectly instructed the jury on the bank fraud count and Mrs.\n\nMoran urges that the prosecutors' summation misstated both the\n\nfacts and the law.        Before addressing these issues, we turn to a\n\nthreshold question:       are these claims of error foreclosed by the\n\ndefendants' failure, as appellees, to pursue them during the\n\noriginal appeal (Moran I)?\n\n\n\n\n     6\n      The fact that the district court originally granted the\ndefendants' motion for judgment of acquittal is not an infallible\nharbinger of how motions for new trial would fare. The district\ncourt's judgment, informed by the opinion in Moran I, may well be\ndifferent. In any event, no less an authority than the Supreme\nCourt has stated that in the ineffective assistance context, \"the\nidiosyncracies of the particular decisionmaker . . . are irrelevant\nto the prejudice inquiry.\" Strickland, 466 U.S. at 695.\n\n                                   -20-\n\f               1.    Preclusion.       We begin our discussion on a cautionary\n\nnote:    the government did not make a preclusion argument in its\n\nmain    appellate        brief,    but,      rather,       frontally   addressed      the\n\nsubstance of the Morans' assignments of error.                      We recognized the\n\npossibility         of   preclusion     during      oral    argument   and   requested\n\nsupplemental        briefing      on   the    point.        The   government,   in    its\n\nsupplemental brief, has argued for preclusion — but its failure to\n\nraise the preclusion issue in a timely manner is reason enough to\n\ndeem it waived.          See United States v. Rodriguez-Marrero, ___ F.3d\n\n___, ___ (1st Cir. 2004) [No. 01-1647, slip op. at 32]; United\n\nStates v. Caraballo-Cruz, 52 F.3d 390, 393 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n               To be sure, we have discretion, in the interests of\n\njustice, to overlook this kind of waiver — a lack of developed\n\nargumentation — by the government in a criminal case.                        See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Rose, 104 F.3d 1408, 1414 (1st Cir. 1997).                          Even\n\nwere we prone to exercise that discretion here, it would not profit\n\nthe government.          We explain briefly.\n\n               In general, available claims of error not raised in an\n\ninitial appeal may not be raised during subsequent appeals in the\n\nsame case.      See United States v. Abreu-Cabrera, 94 F.3d 47, 49 (2d\n\nCir. 1996) (explaining that \"appellate courts will refuse to\n\nconsider trial court rulings that could have been raised on an\n\nearlier appeal\"); see also United States v. Ticchiarelli, 171 F.3d\n\n24,    28-29    (1st     Cir.   1999).        Here,    however,     the   Morans     were\n\n\n                                             -21-\n\fappellees during the first appeal.    That juxtaposition may make a\n\nmaterial difference where, as here, the judgment from which an\n\nappeal is taken is entirely favorable to the appellee and that\n\nparty, after losing the appeal, then seeks to raise a new issue\n\nduring a later appeal of an unfavorable judgment.       See, e.g.,\n\nLaitram Corp. v. NEC Corp., 115 F.3d 947, 954 (Fed. Cir. 1997);\n\nCrocker v. Piedmont Aviation, Inc., 49 F.3d 735, 740-41 (D.C. Cir.\n\n1995). Absent a cross-appeal, an appellee can only raise arguments\n\nin support of the judgment during the course of an appeal.   United\n\nStates v. Am. Ry. Express Co., 265 U.S. 425, 435-36 (1924); Martin\n\nv. Tango's Restaurant, Inc., 969 F.2d 1319, 1325 (1st Cir. 1992).\n\nA cross-appeal normally is improper when taken by a defendant from\n\na favorable judgment, Field v. Mans, 157 F.3d 35, 41 (1st Cir.\n\n1998), and arguably impermissible when taken by a defendant from a\n\njudgment of acquittal in a criminal case.     See United States v.\n\nBoyd, 958 F.2d 247, 250 (8th Cir. 1992); United States v. Williams,\n\n679 F.2d 504, 507 (5th Cir. 1982).\n\n          Given these authorities, we need not decide definitively\n\nwhether a cross-appeal might have been permitted in connection with\n\nthe government's earlier appeal of the judgments of acquittal.\n\nWhen an appellee fails to contest a point that is irrelevant unless\n\nthe main appeal results in reversal or remand, this court, even if\n\na cross-appeal theoretically might have been possible, has been\n\nreluctant to find preclusion.        See Field, 157 F.3d at 41-42\n\n\n                               -22-\n\f(abjuring    preclusion      based    solely   on    a   failure    to    file   a\n\n\"procedurally     dubious     cross-appeal\"     relating     to    what    \"might\n\n[originally] have seemed an entirely redundant point\").\n\n            Let us be perfectly clear.         There are times when even an\n\nappellee who is defending an entirely favorable judgment must\n\neither raise an error purportedly committed by the district court\n\nor waive it.      Typically, however, this occurs when correction of\n\nthe error would provide either an alternate or an additional basis\n\nfor affirmance of a favorable judgment.             See, e.g., Schering Corp.\n\nv. Ill. Antibiotics Co., 89 F.3d 357, 358-59 (7th Cir. 1996).                  That\n\nis   not   the   situation    here:     the    defendants'    newly      asserted\n\nassignments of error — an ostensible flaw in the jury instructions\n\nand allegations of prosecutorial misconduct — are claims of legal\n\nerror which, if sustained, would lead only to a retrial, not to an\n\nacquittal. Thus, even apart from the government's waiver, we would\n\nlikely deem the defendants free to raise the assigned errors for\n\nthe first time in this proceeding.\n\n            2.     Jury   Instructions.        We   turn   next    to    the   jury\n\ninstructions.      The defendants contend that the district court\n\nimproperly charged the jury on the elements of bank fraud.                       We\n\nexamine that contention.\n\n            The federal bank fraud statute provides in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n            Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to\n            execute, a scheme or artifice—\n\n                                      -23-\n\f                      (1) to defraud a financial\n                   institution; or\n\n                      (2) to obtain any of the\n                   moneys, funds, credits, assets,\n                   securities, or other property\n                   owned by, or under the custody\n                   or control of, a financial\n                   institution, by means of false\n                   or    fraudulent     pretenses,\n                   representations, or promises;\n\n          shall be [punished as provided].\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1344.      The Supreme Court has glossed this language,\n\nstating that any scheme to defraud a financial institution must\n\n\"employ material falsehoods.\"     Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1,\n\n20 (1999) (emphasis omitted).\n\n          In this case, the lower court instructed the jury,\n\nwithout objection, that it could base a guilty verdict on either\n\nsubsection (1) or (2), and then explicated each subsection.            With\n\nregard to section 1344(1), the court defined a scheme to defraud\n\nwithout specifying that the prevarications embodied in the scheme\n\nhad to be materially false.     The court did, however, indicate the\n\nnecessity of finding material falsehood with regard to section\n\n1344(2)'s \"obtaining money by false pretenses\" prong.\n\n          During    oral   argument   in   this   court,   the   government\n\nconceded that the district court's section 1344(1) instruction was\n\nerroneous for this reason. See United States v. Benjamin, 252 F.3d\n\n1, 6 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Colon-Munoz, 192 F.3d 210,\n\n221 (1st Cir. 1999).    It pointed out, however, that neither of the\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\fdefendants had objected to the instruction during the time frame\n\nspecified in Fed. R. Crim. P. 30(d) (requiring that objections to\n\njury instructions be made after the judge has charged the jury, but\n\nbefore    the     jury      retires    to     deliberate).7           Under    these\n\ncircumstances, our review is limited to plain error.                   See Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 30(d), 52(b); see also United States v. Olano, 507 U.S.\n\n725, 731-32 (1993).\n\n           A party undertaking the rigors of plain error review must\n\ncarry a heavy burden.          Under that regime, an appealing defendant\n\nmust demonstrate:          \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear\n\nor   obvious    and    which    not   only    (3)    affected   the    defendant's\n\nsubstantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness,\n\nintegrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\"                     United\n\nStates v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir. 2001).               Even then, the\n\nreviewing court may, but is not required to, rectify the situation.\n\nOlano, 507 U.S. at 735-36.            The net result is that plain error\n\nreview    tends       to     afford   relief        to   appellants     only    for\n\n\n\n\n      7\n      Mrs. Moran tries to talk around the problem, insisting that\nher attorney quibbled with the trial court as to the materiality\ninstruction during the pre-charge conference. Such a pre-charge\ncolloquy is insufficient to satisfy the requirements of Rule 30(d).\nSee United States v. Coady, 809 F.2d 119, 123 (1st Cir. 1987)\n(stating that though \"counsel may have discoursed upon the nature\nof his theory at some time prior to the giving of the charge,\" that\ncircumstance \"will not excuse noncompliance with the express\nmandates of Rule 30\"); see also United States v. Arthurs, 73 F.3d\n444, 448 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\n                                       -25-\n\f\"blockbuster[]\" errors. United States v. Griffin, 818 F.2d 97, 100\n\n(1st Cir. 1987).\n\n          In this instance, the first two prongs of the test are\n\nsatisfied.    The defendants stumble, however, over the third prong.\n\nThe assigned error did not affect their substantial rights:                        the\n\ndefendants    do   not   and   cannot   show    that   the    inclusion       of    an\n\nadditional materiality instruction had any effect at all on the\n\ntrial or its outcome.\n\n             \"Materiality\" requires only that a false or omitted\n\nstatement have \"a natural tendency to influence, or is capable of\n\ninfluencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it\n\nwas addressed.\"       Neder, 527 U.S. at 16 (brackets and internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).        This court already has noted that the\n\nmateriality of the falsehoods inherent in the defendants' scheme to\n\ndefraud was     evident.       See Moran   I,    312   F.3d    at    491   &   n.13\n\n(concluding that the bank might well have acted differently had it\n\nknown of the defendants' interests); see also id. at 496 (Boudin,\n\nC.J.,   concurring)      (finding   \"unpersuasive\"       Mrs.       Moran's    non-\n\nmateriality argument).         On the basis of this record, there is\n\nsimply no justification for upsetting the verdict on this ground.\n\nSee Neder, 527 U.S. at 19-20 (holding failure to instruct on\n\nmateriality harmless when record contains no \"evidence that could\n\nrationally lead\" to a contrary finding); United States v. Blastos,\n\n258 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir. 2001) (same).\n\n\n                                    -26-\n\f            3.     The Summation.   The prosecution's closing argument\n\nwas given by two individuals and in two parts, bracketing the\n\ndefendants' summations.       Mrs. Moran asserts that this bifurcated\n\nclosing argument so tainted the trial as to deny her due process.\n\nThis assertion rests on four separate statements attributable to\n\nmembers of the prosecution team.\n\n            Mrs.    Moran   maintains   that   the    first    two     statements\n\nmisstated the facts.        During the initial phase of his summation,\n\none prosecutor said:\n\n            If you go to Exhibit number 43, minutes of the\n            Board of Directors, January of '87, Nora Moran\n            is present. It talks about how the activities\n            of the Executive Committee are brought up for\n            presentation and the summarization by Mr.\n            Murray.   There was testimony they would be\n            summarized, the individual loans might be\n            talked about, they would be brought forth for\n            review and approval.        And the records\n            affirmatively show Nora Moran was there that\n            day.   She voted in favor of the loan, her\n            loan, involving Puente and Boersner and their\n            finances and made no dissent, no abstention,\n            no disclosure.\n\nAnother prosecutor made essentially the same comment during the\n\nrebuttal phase of the summation.           We treat these two statements\n\ntogether.        Inasmuch    as   the   defense      did   not    interpose      a\n\ncontemporaneous objection on either occasion, we review only for\n\nplain error.       See Griffin, 818 F.2d at 99-100.\n\n            We discern no plain error.          The evidence supported a\n\nreasonable inference that First American's board of directors voted\n\non   the   Puente/Boersner    loans.     The   evidence       showed    that   the\n\n                                    -27-\n\fexecutive committee approved the loans in December; that the\n\ncommittee's custom and practice was to transmit a complete list of\n\nits approved loans to the board; that the board typically would\n\nconsider, and vote on, the approved loans at the next month's board\n\nmeeting; and that Mrs. Moran attended that meeting (held in January\n\nof 1987).      No more was exigible to allow the argument to be\n\nproffered.\n\n            Mrs. Moran suggests that these statements were improper\n\nbased on the observations subsequently made by the district court\n\nin support of its      entry of judgment of acquittal.        In that\n\ndecision, the court opined that, even had Mrs. Moran voted on the\n\nPuente/Boersner loans, the most that could be said was that she had\n\nvoted to accept a summary report rather than to ratify or approve\n\nthose particular loans (as the bank, by the time of the vote,\n\nalready had committed, and largely disbursed, the funds).\n\n             Mrs. Moran's suggestion is a non-sequitur.   At the close\n\nof the evidence, the court allowed the case to go to the jury on a\n\nprimary theory of liability having two strains — a voting theory\n\nand a non-disclosure theory — and a less prominent aiding and\n\nabetting theory.     Moran I, 312 F.3d at 492 & n.14.      This court\n\nfound the voting theory insufficiently proven, but found the\n\nevidence adequate to support the verdict on both the non-disclosure\n\ntheory and the aiding and abetting theory.     Id. at 492-93.   Given\n\nthis posture of the case, Mrs. Moran's challenge lacks bite.\n\n\n                                 -28-\n\f            It is common ground that when \"disjunctive theories are\n\nsubmitted to the jury and the jury renders a general verdict of\n\nguilty . . . as long as there was sufficient evidence to support\n\none   of   the    theories   presented,   then   the   verdict   should   be\n\naffirmed.\"       United States v. Garcia, 992 F.2d 409, 416 (2d Cir.\n\n1993) (citing Griffin v. United States, 502 U.S. 46, 49-51, 55-60\n\n(1991)).    If it does not offend due process to affirm a conviction\n\neven though one of several charged theories of guilt had an\n\ninsufficient evidentiary predicate, see Griffin, 502 U.S. at 51;\n\nUnited States v. Nieves-Burgos, 62 F.3d 431, 434-36 (1st Cir.\n\n1995), a fortiori, mere argument in support of that insufficient\n\ntheory, fairly derived from the record, cannot violate due process.\n\nTo hold otherwise would eviscerate the Griffin doctrine.\n\n            Mrs. Moran fares no better on the other aspect of her\n\nprosecutorial misconduct claim.      This involves her insistence that\n\nthe prosecutors twice misstated the law (once during the initial\n\nphase of the summation and again during the rebuttal phase) when it\n\nwas said, in effect, that Mr. Moran could not make any legally\n\nexculpatory disclosures on behalf of his wife.          Here, too, neither\n\nstatement drew a contemporaneous objection, so appellate review is\n\nlimited to plain error.       See Griffin, 818 F.2d at 99-100.\n\n            In order to prevail under the four-part plain error\n\nregime, see Duarte, 246 F.3d at 60, Mrs. Moran's first obligation\n\n\n\n\n                                   -29-\n\fis to show that the prosecutors' statements were legally flawed.\n\nShe has failed to make that showing.\n\n           As said, there were three routes to finding that Mrs.\n\nMoran possessed the scienter necessary to have committed bank\n\nfraud.   The voting theory implicated banking regulations, uniquely\n\napplicable to Mrs. Moran in her capacity as a director of the bank,\n\nwhich required her to inform her fellow directors about any loans\n\nin which she had a financial interest and to disqualify herself\n\nfrom voting on them.    The non-disclosure theory implicated Mrs.\n\nMoran's duty, as the bank's fiduciary, to report her husband's\n\ndouble-dealing.    The aiding and abetting theory implicated her\n\nknowing assistance to her husband's fraud.     Under the latter two\n\ntheories, Mrs. Moran's criminal intent was premised on knowledge\n\nthat her husband had breached his ethical duties to the bank.   This\n\nwas what attracted Chief Judge Boudin's concern.   See Moran I, 312\n\nF.3d at 494-95 (Boudin, C.J., concurring).\n\n           This segmentation is critical to our disposition of this\n\naspect of Mrs. Moran's prosecutorial misconduct claim, for the\n\ncontext of the challenged statements makes it clear that they\n\nreferred to her personal obligation under the voting theory.    The\n\nprosecutor was arguing, in effect, that Mrs. Moran's obligation to\n\nthe board of directors could not be deemed satisfied by her\n\nhusband's alleged disclosure to Noke.        This argument restated\n\ncompetent testimony that such a disclosure was insufficient because\n\n\n                                -30-\n\fNoke was a subordinate employee of the bank, not a fellow director.\n\nViewed in this light, the challenged statements can be read as\n\npositing that even if Mr. Moran had fulfilled his ethical duty,\n\nMrs. Moran knew that she had an independent, supervening duty to\n\nFirst American's board and nonetheless voted on the loans with full\n\nawareness that she had not satisfied that duty.          We believe that\n\nwas within the ambit of permissible advocacy.\n\n          The worst that can be said is that this strain of\n\nargument was ambiguous; it was legally accurate as to one of the\n\nprosecution's theories of guilt, arguably inaccurate as to the\n\nothers, and did not clearly differentiate among them.          But context\n\nis important, and both times the prosecutor made the challenged\n\nstatement, it served as the starting point of a discussion of the\n\nvoting theory.    We do \"not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends\n\nan ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a\n\njury, sitting through lengthy exhortation, will draw that meaning\n\nfrom the plethora of less damaging interpretations.\" United States\n\nv. Lilly, 983 F.2d 300, 307 (1st Cir. 1992) (quoting Donnelly v.\n\nDeChristoforo,    416   U.S.   637,    647   (1974)).   We   make   no   such\n\ninference here.   Considering the context of the statements and the\n\nfact that no contemporaneous objection was lodged, we must give the\n\nprosecutor the benefit of the doubt.         See United States v. Taylor,\n\n54 F.3d 967, 979 (1st Cir. 1995); Lilly, 983 F.2d at 307.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -31-\n\f            If more were needed — and we doubt that it is — we are\n\nsatisfied that the judge's charge dispelled any possible confusion.\n\nThe charge clearly differentiated among the government's three\n\ntheories.     It identified how the regulatory duties of Mrs. Moran,\n\nas a director, differed from the general fiduciary duties owed by\n\nboth defendants, and limned the contours of the aiding and abetting\n\ntheory. To cinch matters, the court explicitly instructed that \"if\n\nwhat [the attorneys] have said about the law seems to . . . have a\n\ndifferent meaning in any way from my instructions on the law, you\n\nmust   be   guided    only   by    my   instructions.\"        Under   these\n\ncircumstances, we are confident that any prejudice stemming from\n\nthe challenged statements did not survive the court's charge.\n\nThere was, therefore, no plain error.        See Taylor, 54 F.3d at 977.\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n            We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above,\n\nwe affirm the convictions and sentences of both defendants.           In so\n\ndoing, however, we do not adjudicate the merits of the defendants'\n\nineffective    assistance    of   counsel   claims.   Those    claims   are\n\ndismissed without prejudice and may be resurrected, should either\n\nor both of the defendants so elect, in post-conviction proceedings\n\nunder 22 U.S.C. § 2255.      See Mala, 7 F.3d at 1064.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -32-\n\f",

In its first iteration, a panel of this court set aside the district court's entry of judgment n.o.v. for the defendants and reinstated guilty verdicts returned by the jury. <i>See United States v. Moran,</i> 312 F.3d 480 (1st Cir.2002) (<i>Moran I</i>). The district court subsequently declared untimely the defendants' belated efforts to secure a new trial and imposed sentence. The defendants now appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This time around, we are asked to reconsider the original panel decision; to reverse the district court's determination that the defendants did not file a timeous motion for new trial; and to grant relief from the judgments of conviction on the ground that the defendants were burdened by ineffective assistance of counsel. In addition, the defendants advance, for the first time, claims of instructional error and prosecutorial misconduct. We reject outright the vast majority of these animadversions. As to the ineffective assistance claims, however, we find the record insufficient to rule definitively, and so dismiss those claims without prejudice to their renewal in proceedings under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sketch the facts of the offenses of conviction, referring the reader who hungers for more exegetic detail to our earlier opinion. <i>See Moran I,</i> 312 F.3d at 482-87. Following the established praxis, we rehearse these facts in the light most compatible with the verdicts. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Hussein,</i> 351 F.3d 9, 11 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October of 1986, John M. Moran, an attorney who represented, inter alios, First American Bank for Savings, met with Edgar Puente and David Boersner, aspiring real estate developers, who were seeking financing for a pair of projects in Boston, Massachusetts. The developers hired Mr. Moran as their mortgage broker and agreed to pay him 1.5% of the face amount of any loans that he procured on their behalf. Mr. Moran arranged a meeting between the developers and a First American loan officer, Edmund Noke, during which Noke agreed to lend Puente and Boersner $17,000,000. Following this meeting, the developers agreed that Mr. Moran would receive a 20% profit interest in the two projects. His wife, Nora F. Moran &#8212; who sat on the board of directors of First American &#8212; created the Moran Development Group Trust (MDG Trust) to hold the equity interest and named herself sole trustee. Under state law, the identity of the beneficiaries of the MDG Trust was not a matter of public record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November of 1986, Mr. Moran submitted formal loan proposals to First American on behalf of Puente and Boersner. He disclosed neither his 20% profit interest nor his anticipated 1.5% brokerage fee, even though he was duty bound to do so. First American's executive committee approved the loans in December, and the bank designated Mr. Moran as its closing attorney. Mr. Moran conducted the closing, charged the bank handsomely for his services, and (unbeknownst to the bank) collected $255,000 from the developers. He never submitted the customary settlement sheets, which would have detailed the use of the loan proceeds (and, thus, would have revealed his conflicted interests).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record indicates that the Puente/Boersner loans were among 153 loans approved that month by the bank's executive committee. The committee considered those loans for approval in two groups. The first vote approved a block of 140 loans, and the second approved the remaining 13. The Puente/Boersner loans were part of the second (smaller) lot. The executive committee sent a report of its December activities to the bank's board of directors, but only provided details as to the first batch of loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1987, the board of directors, including Mrs. Moran, met to consider the December report. The parties fiercely contest exactly what transpired at that meeting. The government's version, disputed by the defendants, is that Mrs. Moran voted either to ratify or approve the Puente/Boersner loans instead of disqualifying herself due to her and her husband's financial interests. Whatever happened that day, it is clear that Mrs. Moran never disclosed to First American the Morans' financial interests in the loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By 1988, the Puente/Boersner loans were underwater. Spurred by the prospect of a substantial loss, First American began an investigation that would eventually uncover the manifold irregularities surrounding the loans and the Morans' interests in them. In a meeting with First American's outside counsel, Mrs. Moran admitted that she knew about her husband's financial stake at the time the loans were approved. For his part, Mr. Moran claimed that he had fully recounted his conflicted interests to Noke. The bank's records did not reflect any such disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the Puente/Boersner loans eventually soured and the bank failed, the saga continued. On July 9, 1997, a federal grand jury indicted the Morans for, inter alia, committing bank fraud by failing to disclose their financial interests in the Puente/Boersner projects, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344, aiding and abetting bank fraud, <i>id.</i> &#167; 2, and conspiring to commit bank fraud, <i>id.</i> &#167; 371.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Trial commenced on May 17, 1999. As to Mr. Moran, the government introduced evidence describing his fiduciary duties to the bank. It also adduced evidence showing that the paperwork he had submitted to First American did not disclose either the brokerage or profit-sharing arrangements. Finally, Noke testified that Mr. Moran never divulged his economic stake in the development projects and stated that such a revelation would have led to the filing of an insider transaction report. The government then showed that no such report appeared in the bank's archives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's case against Mrs. Moran was thinner. It did, however, introduce evidence limning her regulatory and fiduciary duties and showing that she was involved in various ways with the Puente/Boersner loans (e.g., she had visited the sites during a pre-loan inspection, had created the MDG Trust and named herself as trustee, and was generally privy to her husband's financial dealings). The government also proved that Mrs. Moran had failed to apprise her fellow board members about the Morans' financial interests in the Puente/Boersner projects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense moved for judgment of acquittal following the close of the government's case in chief. Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a). The district court denied the motions. During the defense case, Mr. Moran testified that he had made full disclosure to Noke. Mrs. Moran did not testify. The government presented one rebuttal witness. At the close of all the evidence, the defense again moved for judgment of acquittal. The district court reserved decision, Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(b), and the jury found the defendants guilty on all the submitted counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The verdicts were recorded on July 14, 1999, and judgment entered on that date. The next day, the Morans filed a renewed motion for judgment of acquittal. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c). The district court granted the Morans an extension of time within which to file supplemental memoranda. On September 15, each defendant filed a supplemental memorandum that asked the court, among other things, to treat the joint July 15 motion, in the alternative, as a motion for new trial under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33. The government opposed both the motion for judgment of acquittal and the requests for conversion. The district court pondered the matter at length.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> On July 13, 2000, it granted the motion for judgment of acquittal without addressing the conversion requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government appealed from this ruling. We reversed. <i>Moran I,</i> 312 F.3d at 494. As to Mr. Moran, we found ample evidence to support the verdict: he had a plain duty to disclose his sharply conflicted financial interests to the bank, and his testimony that he had made the disclosure allowed the jury, based on credibility and demeanor, to disbelieve him and credit Noke's contrary testimony. <i>Id.</i> at 490-91. To buttress that permissible finding, the record supported the conclusion that Mr. Moran intentionally failed to disclose the information in order to gain a financial advantage. <i>Id.</i> at 491. \"In sum, there was sufficient evidence to allow a rational jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that ... Moran concealed his financial arrangements with Puente and Boersner... pursuant to an affirmative endeavor calculated to defraud First American.\" <i>Id.</i> at 491-92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Mrs. Moran, we found that although the government's theory that she had voted to ratify or approve the Puente/Boersner loans did not pass muster, <i>see supra</i> note 2, there were other, independently sufficient grounds for upholding the verdict. <i>Id.</i> at 492. Specifically, the government had presented adequate evidence to allow a rational jury to conclude that Mrs. Moran, \"aware of her husband's outside dealings and arrangements concerning the projects prior to the consummation of the transactions at issue, chose not to disclose the conflicts ... because she anticipated that a financial windfall would accrue to her husband (and by extension to her) should the loans be approved.\" <i>Id.</i> We also discerned significant evidence that Mrs. Moran had aided and abetted her husband's scheme: she accompanied her husband on an inspection of the properties before the loan applications were submitted; she created the MDG Trust two days before the bank's executive committee approved the loans; and she named herself as trustee instead of Mr. Moran's secretary (as was their custom). <i>Id.</i> We also observed that Mrs. Moran regularly shared financial matters with her husband and that she was, in her own right, \"an astute real estate broker and bank director familiar with the affirmative duties of disclosure.\" <i>Id.</i> at 492. Taken as a whole, this evidence sufficed for a rational jury to convict Mrs. Moran of both bank fraud and conspiracy. <i>Id.</i> at 493-94. Chief Judge Boudin joined in the reinstatement of the convictions but wrote separately to suggest that the thinness of the evidence against Mrs. Moran probably would support an order granting her a new trial if the district court found that she had timely sought that anodyne. <i>Id.</i> at 495-96 (Boudin, C.J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the Morans moved for a hearing on their outstanding requests to convert their Rule 29 motion into a Rule 33 motion. The government filed an opposition. The district court rebuffed the conversion requests, ruling that the defendants had not seasonably moved for a new trial. The court proceeded to pronounce sentence. These timely appeals followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide our analysis into several discrete segments, corresponding with the variety of the defendants' arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Law of the Case.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with Mrs. Moran's explicit beseechment that we revisit and repudiate the prior panel opinion. The government counters that we are without the power to conduct such a review under the law of the case doctrine and that, in all events, the predecessor panel got it right. We give each side half a loaf. On the one hand, we agree with Mrs. Moran that, as a theoretical matter, we have some authority &#8212; albeit limited authority &#8212; to reexamine our earlier decision. On the other hand, we agree with the government that the circumstances at hand do not warrant displacing the earlier ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law of the case doctrine \"posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\" <i>Arizona v. California,</i> 460 U.S. 605, 618, 103 S.Ct. 1382, 75 L.Ed.2d 318 (1983). The doctrine has two branches. The first branch &#8212; the mandate rule &#8212; prevents relitigation in the trial court of matters that were explicitly or implicitly decided by an earlier appellate decision in the same case. <i>United States v. Vigneau,</i> 337 F.3d 62, 67 (1st Cir.2003). The second branch contemplates that a legal decision made at one stage of a criminal or civil proceeding should remain the law of that case throughout the litigation, unless and until the decision is modified or overruled by a higher court. <i>See Christianson v. Colt Indus. Oper'g Corp.,</i> 486 U.S. 800, 816-17, 108 S.Ct. 2166, 100 L.Ed.2d 811 (1988). That branch binds, for example, a successor appellate panel in a second appeal in the same case, <i>see Cohen v. Brown Univ.,</i> 101 F.3d 155, 167-68 (1st Cir.1996), and a successor trial judge who steps in to complete a pending case, <i>see Flibotte v. Pa. Truck Lines, Inc.,</i> 131 F.3d 21, 24-25 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are dealing here with the second branch of the law of the case doctrine. That branch is prudential and, accordingly, is more flexible than the first. We recently catalogued several situations in which a court might appropriately reconsider its past decision. <i>See Ellis v. United States,</i> 313 F.3d 636, 647-48 (1st Cir.2002). Mrs. Moran asseverates that this case comes within that taxonomy as a case in which \"reconsideration may be appropriate to avoid manifest injustice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 648.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While <i>Ellis</i> recognized this exception &#8212; and we reaffirm its vitality &#8212; a litigant seeking to fit within its confines must negotiate a steep uphill climb. In this context, a finding of manifest injustice requires, at a bare minimum, \"a definite and firm conviction that a prior ruling on a material matter is unreasonable or obviously wrong,\" and resulted in prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 648 &amp; n. 5. Mrs. Moran cannot scale these heights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mounting her argument, Mrs. Moran relies exclusively on Chief Judge Boudin's concurring opinion in <i>Moran I.</i> What she seemingly fails to appreciate is that even the author of that concurrence concluded that there was sufficient evidence upon which to ground a conviction. <i>Moran I,</i> 312 F.3d at 495-96 (Boudin, C.J., concurring). That conclusion is antithetic to Mrs. Moran's claim that the concurrence necessitates (or even supports) a finding that the earlier panel opinion was, in the <i>Ellis</i> phrase, \"unreasonable or obviously wrong.\" <i>Ellis,</i> 313 F.3d at 648. Since Mrs. Moran points to no other authority to support such a finding, there is no basis for suspecting manifest injustice here. We therefore decline Mrs. Moran's invitation to disturb the decision in <i>Moran I.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Attempted Conversion.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A motion for a new trial in a federal criminal case, other than a motion alleging newly discovered evidence, must be filed within seven days next following the initial entry of judgment. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(2). Mr. Moran filed no such motion within the allotted interval. In an endeavor to repair this omission, he asseverates that the defendants' timely motion for judgment of acquittal should have been considered \"alternatively\" as a motion for new trial and that, therefore, the district court should have converted that Rule 29 motion into a Rule 33 motion for a new trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> This asseveration is hopeless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion to which Mr. Moran alludes was captioned \"Motion[] for Judgment of Acquittal and for Additional Time to File Memoranda.\" The body of the motion reads in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NOW COME defendants John and Nora Moran, through counsel, and pursuant to Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and hereby renew their motions for this Honorable Court to enter a judgment of acquittal as to all counts of the Superseding Indictment. In support thereof, counsel states the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6.... [T]he government failed to offer sufficient evidence upon which a rational jury could find the Defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crimes of bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. The government's evidence is equally consistent with guilt as it is with innocence which requires a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8. Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the government established that the Defendants violated bank policy and/or civil banking regulations, the government failed to introduce any other conduct which may form the basis for a bank fraud conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9. The government has failed to prove intent on the part of the Defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10. Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the government has proven that the Defendants intended to defraud First American Bank, it failed to prove that their statements or omissions were material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WHEREFORE, based upon the foregoing arguing [sic] arguments and authorities this Honorable Court is respectfully urged to permit the Defendants additional time to file memoranda in support of the instant motion and to enter a judgment of acquittal as to all counts of the Superseding Indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Moran suggests that this motion was sufficient to permit a judge to grant him a new trial based on the following syllogism: (i) the substance of a motion, not its title, controls; (ii) a motion pointing out that the government did not have enough evidence to convict a defendant, a priori, supports a claim that the weight of the evidence tipped greatly in the defendant's favor; (iii) such a weight-of-the-evidence finding would support the granting of a new trial; and so (iv) a motion seeking judgment of acquittal because of insufficient evidence &#8212; like Mr. Moran's motion &#8212; \"logically\" must encompass a request for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken in the abstract, some of these premises are correct. For example, we have stated that \"[i]n addressing a post-judgment motion, a court is not bound by the label that the movant fastens to it\" and may \"reclassify the motion as its substance suggests.\" <i>Vasapolli v. Rostoff,</i> 39 F.3d 27, 36 (1st Cir.1994). So too a timely motion for new trial may be granted when \"evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict.\" <i>United States v. Wilkerson,</i> 251 F.3d 273, 278 (1st Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). But two swallows do not a summer make, and Mr. Moran's syllogism falls apart when one analyzes its conclusion: that a motion seeking a judgment of acquittal on sufficiency-of-the-evidence grounds necessarily must be read as requesting a consolation prize in the nature of a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That reading is neither logically compelled nor legally appropriate. Where the motion papers cannot be fairly construed as a request for a new trial, a district court does not have the authority, sua sponte, to convert a motion for judgment of acquittal into a motion for a new trial. <i>United States v. Navarro Viayra,</i> 365 F.3d 790, 793 (9th Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Brown,</i> 587 F.2d 187, 189 (5th Cir.1979). That choice is the defendant's &#8212; and the defendant's alone. What is more, it must be exercised within the time parameters prescribed by the Criminal Rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(2) specifies that a motion for new trial, other than a motion grounded on newly discovered evidence, must be filed within seven days of the jury verdict (i.e., the entry of judgment). That rule was amended in 1966 to \"make it clear that a judge has no power to order a new trial on his own motion\" once judgment has entered. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 advisory committee notes (1966 Amendments). Simultaneously, the advisory committee made it pellucid that the Criminal Rules forbid an interpretation that would allow a district court, on its own initiative, to evade the temporal strictures of Rule 33 by reading into a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal a request for a new trial, not solicited by the movant. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 advisory committee notes (1966 Amendments, Subdivision (c)) (explaining that Rule 29(c) precludes an interpretation that \"gives the [district] court power to order a new trial even though the defendant ... has not asked for one\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed against this backdrop, it is transparently clear that even if a motion for judgment of acquittal contains a substantive basis sufficient to ground the grant of a new trial, a court is without power to treat the motion as a motion for a new trial unless it also contains some overt indication that the movant desires that relief. The motion in this case contained no such indication. It invoked Rule 29, not Rule 33, and the only relief requested was an outright acquittal. It was not until September 15, 1999 &#8212; well beyond the seven-day deadline &#8212; that Mr. Moran informed the district court of his desire for a new trial. That was too late.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That disposes of this assignment of error. The Criminal Rules gave Mr. Moran seven days within which to move for a new trial. He failed to seek that relief, and his timely motion for judgment of acquittal did not fill the void. Consequently, the district court acted appropriately both in denying Mr. Moran's belated conversion request and in refusing to grant a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants next claim that the failure of their trial attorneys to file timely new trial motions constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and, as such, justifies retrial. This claim, raised for the first time in this venue, is premature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\" <i>United States v. Mala,</i> 7 F.3d 1058, 1063 (1st Cir.1993) (collecting cases). This rule is prudential in nature. A claim of ineffective assistance requires a showing that the attorney turned in a constitutionally deficient performance that prejudiced the defendant's substantial rights. <i>See Strickland v. Washington,</i> 466 U.S. 668, 687, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); <i>United States v. Martinez-Vargas,</i> 321 F.3d 245, 251 (1st Cir.2003). Claims of this sort \"typically require the resolution of factual issues that cannot efficaciously be addressed in the first instance by an appellate tribunal.\" <i>Mala,</i> 7 F.3d at 1063. In addition, the insights of the trier, who has seen and heard the witnesses at first hand and watched the dynamics of the trial unfold, are often of great assistance. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Fish,</i> 34 F.3d 488, 494 n. 4 (7th Cir.1994); <i>United States v. McGill,</i> 952 F.2d 16, 19 (1st Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is such a case. No ineffective assistance claim surfaced in the district court, and the record is barren of evidence as to why the lawyers did what they did. There are both tactical and strategic reasons why a party might seek a judgment of acquittal but not a new trial (for example, a fear that the prosecution will learn from its mistakes and put in a more persuasive case the second time around, a fear that the decisionmaker will take a request for acquittal less seriously if a possible compromise &#8212; such as a new trial &#8212; is on the table, or a fear that a shift in judges will lead to a stiffer sentence). Although hindsight is always 20/20, we cannot tell from this record whether the decision not to seek a new trial, <i>when made,</i> was a calculated stratagem or a mere oversight. Factfinding will be required to make that determination, which means that the district court should hear the claim in the first instance. <i>See, e.g., McGill,</i> 952 F.2d at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that even if the failure to ask for a new trial betokens objectively unreasonable (and, therefore, constitutionally deficient) performance on the part of the lawyers &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; it remains to be determined whether any such failure was prejudicial within the meaning of <i>Strickland.</i> A finding of prejudice here would require a subsidiary finding that, but for the error, the moving defendant probably would have received a new trial. <i>See, e.g., Flores v. Demskie,</i> 215 F.3d 293, 305 (2d Cir.2000). That question is not open and shut. Each defendant must independently demonstrate that, given the holding of this court in <i>Moran I,</i> an objectively reasonable district court would likely have granted a new trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> <i>See Butcher v. United States,</i> 368 F.3d 1290, 1294-95 (11th Cir.2004); <i>Ouber v. Guarino,</i> 293 F.3d 19, 32-33, 33 n. 10 (1st Cir.2002). The nisi prius court is the proper forum in which the defendants may attempt to make this showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For these reasons, we decline to entertain the ineffective assistance claims here and now. Instead, we dismiss them without prejudice to their reassertion, should the defendants so choose, in proceedings under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">D. <i>Miscellaneous Assignments of Error.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are two other issues lurking at the periphery of these appeals: both defendants argue that the district court incorrectly instructed the jury on the bank fraud count and Mrs. Moran urges that the prosecutors' summation misstated both the facts and the law. Before addressing these issues, we turn to a threshold question: are these claims of error foreclosed by the defendants' failure, as appellees, to pursue them during the original appeal (<i>Moran I</i>)?</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Preclusion.</i> We begin our discussion on a cautionary note: the government did not make a preclusion argument in its main appellate brief, but, rather, frontally addressed the substance of the Morans' assignments of error. We recognized the possibility of preclusion during oral argument and requested supplemental briefing on the point. The government, in its supplemental brief, has argued for preclusion &#8212; but its failure to raise the preclusion issue in a timely manner is reason enough to deem it waived. <i>See United States v. Rodriguez-Marrero,</i> 390 F.3d 1 (1st Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Caraballo-Cruz,</i> 52 F.3d 390, 393 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, we have discretion, in the interests of justice, to overlook this kind of waiver &#8212; a lack of developed argumentation &#8212; by the government in a criminal case. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Rose,</i> 104 F.3d 1408, 1414 (1st Cir.1997). Even were we prone to exercise that discretion here, it would not profit the government. We explain briefly.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In general, <i>available</i> claims of error not raised in an initial appeal may not be raised during subsequent appeals in the same case. <i>See United States v.</i> <i>Abreu-Cabrera,</i> 94 F.3d 47, 49 (2d Cir.1996) (explaining that \"appellate courts will refuse to consider trial court rulings that could have been raised on an earlier appeal\"); <i>see also United States v. Ticchiarelli,</i> 171 F.3d 24, 28-29 (1st Cir.1999). Here, however, the Morans were <i>appellees</i> during the first appeal. That juxtaposition may make a material difference where, as here, the judgment from which an appeal is taken is entirely favorable to the appellee and that party, after losing the appeal, then seeks to raise a new issue during a later appeal of an unfavorable judgment. <i>See, e.g., Laitram Corp. v. NEC Corp.,</i> 115 F.3d 947, 954 (Fed.Cir.1997); <i>Crocker v. Piedmont Aviation, Inc.,</i> 49 F.3d 735, 740-41 (D.C.Cir.1995). Absent a cross-appeal, an appellee can only raise arguments in support of the judgment during the course of an appeal. <i>United States v. Am. Ry. Express Co.,</i> 265 U.S. 425, 435-36, 44 S.Ct. 560, 68 L.Ed. 1087 (1924); <i>Martin v. Tango's Restaurant, Inc.,</i> 969 F.2d 1319, 1325 (1st Cir.1992). A cross-appeal normally is improper when taken by a defendant from a favorable judgment, <i>Field v. Mans,</i> 157 F.3d 35, 41 (1st Cir.1998), and arguably impermissible when taken by a defendant from a judgment of acquittal in a criminal case. <i>See United States v. Boyd,</i> 958 F.2d 247, 250 (8th Cir.1992); <i>United States v. Williams,</i> 679 F.2d 504, 507 (5th Cir.1982).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Given these authorities, we need not decide definitively whether a cross-appeal might have been permitted in connection with the government's earlier appeal of the judgments of acquittal. When an appellee fails to contest a point that is irrelevant unless the main appeal results in reversal or remand, this court, even if a cross-appeal theoretically might have been possible, has been reluctant to find preclusion. <i>See Field,</i> 157 F.3d at 41-42 (abjuring preclusion based solely on a failure to file a \"procedurally dubious cross-appeal\" relating to what \"might [originally] have seemed an entirely redundant point\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. There are times when even an appellee who is defending an entirely favorable judgment must either raise an error purportedly committed by the district court or waive it. Typically, however, this occurs when correction of the error would provide either an alternate or an additional basis for affirmance of a favorable judgment. <i>See, e.g., Schering Corp. v. Ill. Antibiotics Co.,</i> 89 F.3d 357, 358-59 (7th Cir.1996). That is not the situation here: the defendants' newly asserted assignments of error &#8212; an ostensible flaw in the jury instructions and allegations of prosecutorial misconduct &#8212; are claims of legal error which, if sustained, would lead only to a retrial, not to an acquittal. Thus, even apart from the government's waiver, we would likely deem the defendants free to raise the assigned errors for the first time in this proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Jury Instructions.</i> We turn next to the jury instructions. The defendants contend that the district court improperly charged the jury on the elements of bank fraud. We examine that contention.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal bank fraud statute provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whoever knowingly executes, or attempts to execute, a scheme or artifice &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(1) to defraud a financial institution; or</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(2) to obtain any of the moneys, funds, credits, assets, securities, or other property owned by, or under the custody or control of, a financial institution, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">shall be [punished as provided].</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344. The Supreme Court has glossed this language, stating that any scheme to defraud a financial institution must \"employ material falsehoods.\" <i>Neder v. United States,</i> 527 U.S. 1, 20, 119 S.Ct. 1827, 144 L.Ed.2d 35 (1999) (emphasis omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, the lower court instructed the jury, without objection, that it could base a guilty verdict on either subsection (1) or (2), and then explicated each subsection. With regard to section 1344(1), the court defined a scheme to defraud without specifying that the prevarications embodied in the scheme had to be materially false. The court did, however, indicate the necessity of finding material falsehood with regard to section 1344(2)'s \"obtaining money by false pretenses\" prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During oral argument in this court, the government conceded that the district court's section 1344(1) instruction was erroneous for this reason. <i>See United States v. Benjamin,</i> 252 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Colon-Munoz,</i> 192 F.3d 210, 221 (1st Cir.1999). It pointed out, however, that neither of the defendants had objected to the instruction during the time frame specified in Fed.R.Crim.P. 30(d) (requiring that objections to jury instructions be made after the judge has charged the jury, but before the jury retires to deliberate).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Under these circumstances, our review is limited to plain error. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 30(d), 52(b); <i>see also United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 731-32, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party undertaking the rigors of plain error review must carry a heavy burden. Under that regime, an appealing defendant must demonstrate: \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which was clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected the defendant's substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.2001). Even then, the reviewing court may, but is not required to, rectify the situation. <i>Olano,</i> 507 U.S. at 735-36, 113 S.Ct. 1770. The net result is that plain error review tends to afford relief to appellants only for \"blockbuster[]\" errors. <i>United States v. Griffin,</i> 818 F.2d 97, 100 (1st Cir.1987).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this instance, the first two prongs of the test are satisfied. The defendants stumble, however, over the third prong. The assigned error did not affect their substantial rights: the defendants do not and cannot show that the inclusion of an additional materiality instruction had any effect at all on the trial or its outcome.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"Materiality\" requires only that a false or omitted statement have \"a natural tendency to influence, or is capable of influencing, the decision of the decisionmaking body to which it was addressed.\" <i>Neder,</i> 527 U.S. at 16, 119 S.Ct. 1827 (brackets and internal quotation marks omitted). This court already has noted that the materiality of the falsehoods inherent in the defendants' scheme to defraud was evident. <i>See Moran I,</i> 312 F.3d at 491 &amp; n. 13 (concluding that the bank might well have acted differently had it known of the defendants' interests); <i>see also id.</i> at 496 (Boudin, C.J., concurring) (finding \"unpersuasive\" Mrs. Moran's non-materiality argument). On the basis of this record, there is simply no justification for upsetting the verdict on this ground. <i>See Neder,</i> 527 U.S. at 19-20, 119 S.Ct. 1827 (holding failure to instruct on materiality harmless when record contains no \"evidence that could rationally lead\" to a contrary finding); <i>United States v. Blastos,</i> 258 F.3d 25, 29 (1st Cir.2001) (same).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>The Summation.</i> The prosecution's closing argument was given by two individuals and in two parts, bracketing the defendants' summations. Mrs. Moran asserts that this bifurcated closing argument so tainted the trial as to deny her due process. This assertion rests on four separate statements attributable to members of the prosecution team.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Moran maintains that the first two statements misstated the facts. During the initial phase of his summation, one prosecutor said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you go to Exhibit number 43, minutes of the Board of Directors, January of '87, Nora Moran is present. It talks about how the activities of the Executive Committee are brought up for presentation and the summarization by Mr. Murray. There was testimony they would be summarized, the individual loans might be talked about, they would be brought forth for review and approval. And the records affirmatively show Nora Moran was there that day. She voted in favor of the loan, her loan, involving Puente and Boersner and their finances and made no dissent, no abstention, no disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another prosecutor made essentially the same comment during the rebuttal phase of the summation. We treat these two statements together. Inasmuch as the defense did not interpose a contemporaneous objection on either occasion, we review only for plain error. <i>See Griffin,</i> 818 F.2d at 99-100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no plain error. The evidence supported a reasonable inference that First American's board of directors voted on the Puente/Boersner loans. The evidence showed that the executive committee approved the loans in December; that the committee's custom and practice was to transmit a complete list of its approved loans to the board; that the board typically would consider, and vote on, the approved loans at the next month's board meeting; and that Mrs. Moran attended that meeting (held in January of 1987). No more was exigible to allow the argument to be proffered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Moran suggests that these statements were improper based on the observations subsequently made by the district court in support of its entry of judgment of acquittal. In that decision, the court opined that, even had Mrs. Moran voted on the Puente/Boersner loans, the most that could be said was that she had voted to accept a summary report rather than to ratify or approve those particular loans (as the bank, by the time of the vote, already had committed, and largely disbursed, the funds).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Moran's suggestion is a non-sequitur. At the close of the evidence, the court allowed the case to go to the jury on a primary theory of liability having two strains &#8212; a voting theory and a non-disclosure theory &#8212; and a less prominent aiding and abetting theory. <i>Moran I,</i> 312 F.3d at 492 &amp; n. 14. This court found the voting theory insufficiently proven, but found the evidence adequate to support the verdict on both the non-disclosure theory and the aiding and abetting theory. <i>Id.</i> at 492-93. Given this posture of the case, Mrs. Moran's challenge lacks bite.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is common ground that when \"disjunctive theories are submitted to the jury and the jury renders a general verdict of guilty ... as long as there was sufficient evidence to support one of the theories presented, then the verdict should be affirmed.\" <i>United States v. Garcia,</i> 992 F.2d 409, 416 (2d Cir.1993) (citing <i>Griffin v. United States,</i> 502 U.S. 46, 49-51, 55-60, 112 S.Ct. 466, 116 L.Ed.2d 371 (1991)). If it does not offend due process to affirm a conviction even though one of several charged theories of guilt had an insufficient evidentiary predicate, <i>see Griffin,</i> 502 U.S. at 51, 112 S.Ct. 466; <i>United States v. Nieves-Burgos,</i> 62 F.3d 431, 434-36 (1st Cir.1995), a fortiori, mere argument in support of that insufficient theory, fairly derived from the record, cannot violate due process. To hold otherwise would eviscerate the <i>Griffin</i> doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Moran fares no better on the other aspect of her prosecutorial misconduct claim. This involves her insistence that the prosecutors twice misstated the law (once during the initial phase of the summation and again during the rebuttal phase) when it was said, in effect, that Mr. Moran could not make any legally exculpatory disclosures on behalf of his wife. Here, too, neither statement drew a contemporaneous objection, so appellate review is limited to plain error. <i>See Griffin,</i> 818 F.2d at 99-100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prevail under the four-part plain error regime, <i>see Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d at 60, Mrs. Moran's first obligation is to show that the prosecutors' statements were legally flawed. She has failed to make that showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, there were three routes to finding that Mrs. Moran possessed the scienter necessary to have committed bank fraud. The voting theory implicated banking regulations, uniquely applicable to Mrs. Moran in her capacity as a director of the bank, which required her to inform her fellow directors about any loans in which she had a financial interest and to disqualify herself from voting on them. The non-disclosure theory implicated Mrs. Moran's duty, as the bank's fiduciary, to report her husband's double-dealing. The aiding and abetting theory implicated her knowing assistance to her husband's fraud. Under the latter two theories, Mrs. Moran's criminal intent was premised on knowledge that her husband had breached <i>his</i> ethical duties to the bank. This was what attracted Chief Judge Boudin's concern. <i>See Moran I,</i> 312 F.3d at 494-95 (Boudin, C.J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This segmentation is critical to our disposition of this aspect of Mrs. Moran's prosecutorial misconduct claim, for the context of the challenged statements makes it clear that they referred to her personal obligation under the voting theory. The prosecutor was arguing, in effect, that Mrs. Moran's obligation to the board of directors could not be deemed satisfied by her husband's alleged disclosure to Noke. This argument restated competent testimony that such a disclosure was insufficient because Noke was a subordinate employee of the bank, not a fellow director. Viewed in this light, the challenged statements can be read as positing that even if Mr. Moran had fulfilled his ethical duty, Mrs. Moran knew that she had an independent, supervening duty to First American's board and nonetheless voted on the loans with full awareness that she had not satisfied that duty. We believe that was within the ambit of permissible advocacy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The worst that can be said is that this strain of argument was ambiguous; it was legally accurate as to one of the prosecution's theories of guilt, arguably inaccurate as to the others, and did not clearly differentiate among them. But context is important, and both times the prosecutor made the challenged statement, it served as the starting point of a discussion of the voting theory. We do \"not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a jury, sitting through lengthy exhortation, will draw that meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations.\" <i>United States v. Lilly,</i> 983 F.2d 300, 307 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting <i>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo,</i> 416 U.S. 637, 647, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974)). We make no such inference here. Considering the context of the statements and the fact that no contemporaneous objection was lodged, we must give the prosecutor the benefit of the doubt. <i>See United States v. Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d 967, 979 (1st Cir.1995); <i>Lilly,</i> 983 F.2d at 307.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; we are satisfied that the judge's charge dispelled any possible confusion. The charge clearly differentiated among the government's three theories. It identified how the regulatory duties of Mrs. Moran, as a director, differed from the general fiduciary duties owed by both defendants, and limned the contours of the aiding and abetting theory. To cinch matters, the court explicitly instructed that \"if what [the attorneys] have said about the law seems to ... have a different meaning in any way from my instructions on the law, you must be guided only by my instructions.\" Under these circumstances, we are confident that any prejudice stemming from the challenged statements did not survive the court's charge. There was, therefore, no plain error. <i>See Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 977.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we affirm the convictions and sentences of both defendants. In so doing, however, we do not adjudicate the merits of the defendants' ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Those claims are dismissed without prejudice and may be resurrected, should either or both of the defendants so elect, in post-conviction proceedings under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. <i>See Mala,</i> 7 F.3d at 1064.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The indictment contained a second, unrelated count of bank fraud against Mrs. Moran. The district court granted her motion for judgment of acquittal as to that count at the close of the government's case in chief,<i>Moran I,</i> 312 F.3d at 485-86, and we eschew any further reference to it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> As mentioned above, the government tried to show that, on January 15, 1987, Mrs. Moran had voted to ratify or approve the Puente/Boersner loans, instead of disqualifying herself from the vote. The<i>Moran I</i> panel did not rely on this evidence, <i>see</i> 312 F.3d at 492, and we do not dwell on it at this juncture.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In October of 1999, the defendants jointly filed a separate motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence (specifically, alleged juror misconduct). That motion was timely<i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(1). However, the district court denied it on December 27, 1999. On appeal, the defendants do not attempt to challenge that ruling.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Although the Morans jointly filed the motion for judgment of acquittal, Mrs. Moran does not pursue this line of argument</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Mr. Moran's citation to<i>United States v.

The court neither described the contents of the motion nor explained what relief the defendant had sought. To the extent that <i>Baker</i> suggests that a district court can grant a new trial sua sponte after the entry of judgment in a criminal case, without a timely indication from the defendant that he desires one, its holding is flatly inconsistent with the Criminal Rules and, like the Ninth Circuit, <i>see Navarro Viayra,</i> 365 F.3d at 795, we respectfully decline to follow it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The fact that the district court originally granted the defendants' motion for judgment of acquittal is not an infallible harbinger of how motions for new trial would fare.

In any event, no less an authority than the Supreme Court has stated that in the ineffective assistance context, \"the idiosyncracies of the particular decisionmaker... are irrelevant to the prejudice inquiry.\" <i>Strickland,</i> 466 U.S. at 695, 104 S.Ct. 2052.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Mrs. Moran tries to talk around the problem, insisting that her attorney quibbled with the trial court as to the materiality instruction during the pre-charge conference.

Following the established praxis, we rehearse these facts in the light most compatible with the verdicts. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Hussein,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200713\"><a href=\"/opinion/200713/united-states-v-hussein/\"><span class=\"volume\">351</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">9</span></a></span>, 11 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In October of 1986, John M. Moran, an attorney who represented, inter alios, First American Bank for Savings, met with Edgar Puente and David Boersner, aspiring real estate developers, who were seeking financing for a pair of projects in Boston, Massachusetts. The developers hired Mr. Moran as their mortgage broker and agreed to pay him 1.5% of the face amount of any loans that he procured on their behalf. Mr. Moran arranged a meeting between the developers and a First American loan officer, Edmund Noke, during which Noke agreed to lend Puente and Boersner $17,000,000. Following this meeting, the developers agreed that Mr. Moran would receive a 20% profit interest in the two projects. His wife, Nora F. Moran &#8212; who sat on the board of directors of First American &#8212; created the Moran Development Group Trust (MDG Trust) to hold the equity interest and named herself sole trustee. Under state law, the identity of the beneficiaries of the MDG Trust was not a matter of public record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November of 1986, Mr. Moran submitted formal loan proposals to First American on behalf of Puente and Boersner. He disclosed neither his 20% profit interest nor his anticipated 1.5% brokerage fee, even though he was duty bound to do so. First American's executive committee approved the loans in December, and the bank designated Mr. Moran as its closing attorney. Mr. Moran conducted the closing, charged the bank handsomely for his services, and (unbeknownst to the bank) collected $255,000 from the developers. He never submitted the customary settlement sheets, which would have detailed the use of the loan proceeds (and, thus, would have revealed his conflicted interests).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record indicates that the Puente/Boersner loans were among 153 loans approved that month by the bank's executive committee. The committee considered those loans for approval in two groups. The first vote approved a block of 140 loans, and the second approved the remaining 13. The Puente/Boersner loans were part of the second (smaller) lot. The executive committee sent a report of its December activities to the bank's board of directors, but only provided details as to the first batch of loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In January 1987, the board of directors, including Mrs. Moran, met to consider the December report. The parties fiercely contest exactly what transpired at that meeting. The government's version, disputed by the defendants, is that Mrs. Moran voted either to ratify or approve the Puente/Boersner loans instead of disqualifying herself due to her and her husband's financial interests. Whatever happened that day, it is clear that Mrs. Moran never disclosed to First American the Morans' financial interests in the loans.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By 1988, the Puente/Boersner loans were underwater. Spurred by the prospect of a substantial loss, First American began an investigation that would eventually uncover the manifold irregularities surrounding the loans and the Morans' interests in them. In a meeting with First American's outside counsel, Mrs. Moran admitted that she knew about her husband's financial stake at the time the loans were approved. For his part, Mr. Moran claimed that he had fully recounted his conflicted interests to Noke. The bank's records did not reflect any such disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the Puente/Boersner loans eventually soured and the bank failed, the saga continued. On July 9, 1997, a federal grand jury indicted the Morans for, inter alia, committing bank fraud by failing to disclose their financial interests in the Puente/Boersner projects, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1344, aiding and abetting bank fraud, <i>id.</i> &#167; 2, and conspiring to commit bank fraud, <i>id.</i> &#167; 371.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> Trial commenced on May 17, 1999. As to Mr. Moran, the government introduced evidence describing his fiduciary duties to the bank. It also adduced evidence showing that the paperwork he had submitted to First American did not disclose either the brokerage or profit-sharing arrangements. Finally, Noke testified that Mr. Moran never divulged his economic stake in the development projects and stated that such a revelation would have led to the filing of an insider transaction report. The government then showed that no such report appeared in the bank's archives.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's case against Mrs. Moran was thinner. It did, however, introduce evidence limning her regulatory and fiduciary duties and showing that she was involved in various ways with the Puente/Boersner loans (e.g., she had visited the sites during a pre-loan inspection, had created the MDG Trust and named herself as trustee, and was generally privy to her husband's financial dealings). The government also proved that Mrs. Moran had failed to apprise her fellow board members about the Morans' financial interests in the Puente/Boersner projects.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defense moved for judgment of acquittal following the close of the government's case in chief. Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(a). The district court denied the motions. During the defense case, Mr. Moran testified that he had made full disclosure to Noke. Mrs. Moran did not testify. The government presented one rebuttal witness. At the close of all the evidence, the defense again moved for judgment of acquittal. The district court reserved decision, Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(b), and the jury found the defendants guilty on all the submitted counts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The verdicts were recorded on July 14, 1999, and judgment entered on that date. The next day, the Morans filed a renewed motion for judgment of acquittal. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29(c). The district court granted the Morans an extension of time within which to file supplemental memoranda. On September 15, each defendant filed a supplemental memorandum that asked the court, among other things, to treat the joint July 15 motion, in the alternative, as a motion for new trial under Fed.R.Crim.P. 33. The government opposed both the motion for judgment of acquittal and the requests for conversion. The district court pondered the matter at length.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> On July 13, 2000, it granted the motion for judgment of acquittal without addressing the conversion requests.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government appealed from this ruling. We reversed. <i>Moran I,</i> 312 F.3d at 494. As to Mr. Moran, we found ample evidence to support the verdict: he had a plain duty to disclose his sharply conflicted financial interests to the bank, and his testimony that he had made the disclosure allowed the jury, based on credibility and demeanor, to disbelieve him and credit Noke's contrary testimony. <i>Id.</i> at 490-91. To buttress that permissible finding, the record supported the conclusion that Mr. Moran intentionally failed to disclose the information in order to gain a financial advantage. <i>Id.</i> at 491. \"In sum, there was sufficient evidence to allow a rational jury to conclude, beyond a reasonable doubt, that ... Moran concealed his financial arrangements with Puente and Boersner... pursuant to an affirmative endeavor calculated to defraud First American.\" <i>Id.</i> at 491-92.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to Mrs. Moran, we found that although the government's theory that she had voted to ratify or approve the Puente/Boersner loans did not pass muster, <i>see supra</i> note 2, there were other, independently sufficient grounds for upholding the verdict. <i>Id.</i> at 492. Specifically, the government had presented adequate evidence to allow a rational jury to conclude that Mrs. Moran, \"aware of her husband's outside dealings and arrangements concerning the projects prior to the consummation of the transactions at issue, chose not to disclose the conflicts ... because she anticipated that a financial windfall would accrue to her husband (and by extension to her) should the loans be approved.\" <i>Id.</i> We also discerned significant evidence that Mrs. Moran had aided and abetted her husband's scheme: she accompanied her husband on an inspection of the properties before the loan applications were submitted; she created the MDG Trust two days before the bank's executive committee approved the loans; and she named herself as trustee instead of Mr. Moran's secretary (as was their custom). <i>Id.</i> We also observed that Mrs. Moran regularly shared financial matters with her husband and that she was, in her own right, \"an astute real estate broker and bank director familiar with the affirmative duties of disclosure.\" <i>Id.</i> at 492. Taken as a whole, this evidence sufficed for a rational jury to convict Mrs. Moran of both bank fraud and conspiracy. <i>Id.</i> at 493-94. Chief Judge Boudin joined in the reinstatement of the convictions but wrote separately to suggest that the thinness of the evidence against Mrs. Moran probably would support an order granting her a new trial if the district court found that she had timely sought that anodyne. <i>Id.</i> at 495-96 (Boudin, C.J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On remand, the Morans moved for a hearing on their outstanding requests to convert their Rule 29 motion into a Rule 33 motion. The government filed an opposition. The district court rebuffed the conversion requests, ruling that the defendants had not seasonably moved for a new trial. The court proceeded to pronounce sentence. These timely appeals followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We divide our analysis into several discrete segments, corresponding with the variety of the defendants' arguments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>Law of the Case.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We start with Mrs. Moran's explicit beseechment that we revisit and repudiate the prior panel opinion. The government counters that we are without the power to conduct such a review under the law of the case doctrine and that, in all events, the predecessor panel got it right. We give each side half a loaf. On the one hand, we agree with Mrs. Moran that, as a theoretical matter, we have some authority &#8212; albeit limited authority &#8212; to reexamine our earlier decision. On the other hand, we agree with the government that the circumstances at hand do not warrant displacing the earlier ruling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law of the case doctrine \"posits that when a court decides upon a rule of law, that decision should continue to govern the same issues in subsequent stages in the same case.\" <i>Arizona v. California,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110895\"><a href=\"/opinion/110895/arizona-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">460</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">605</span></a></span>, 618, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110895\"><a href=\"/opinion/110895/arizona-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1382</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110895\"><a href=\"/opinion/110895/arizona-v-california/\"><span class=\"volume\">75</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">318</span></a></span> (1983). The doctrine has two branches. The first branch &#8212; the mandate rule &#8212; prevents relitigation in the trial court of matters that were explicitly or implicitly decided by an earlier appellate decision in the same case. <i>United States v. Vigneau,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200569\"><a href=\"/opinion/200569/united-states-v-vigneau/\"><span class=\"volume\">337</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">62</span></a></span>, 67 (1st Cir.2003). The second branch contemplates that a legal decision made at one stage of a criminal or civil proceeding should remain the law of that case throughout the litigation, unless and until the decision is modified or overruled by a higher court. <i>See Christianson v. Colt Indus. Oper'g Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112104\"><a href=\"/opinion/112104/christianson-v-colt-industries-operating-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">486</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 816-17, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112104\"><a href=\"/opinion/112104/christianson-v-colt-industries-operating-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">108</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">2166</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112104\"><a href=\"/opinion/112104/christianson-v-colt-industries-operating-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">100</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">811</span></a></span> (1988). That branch binds, for example, a successor appellate panel in a second appeal in the same case, <i>see Cohen v. Brown Univ.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"729930\"><a href=\"/opinion/729930/amy-cohen-v-brown-university/\"><span class=\"volume\">101</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span>, 167-68 (1st Cir.1996), and a successor trial judge who steps in to complete a pending case, <i>see Flibotte v. Pa. Truck Lines, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"748872\"><a href=\"/opinion/748872/albert-a-flibotte-v-pennsylvania-truck-lines-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">131</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">21</span></a></span>, 24-25 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are dealing here with the second branch of the law of the case doctrine. That branch is prudential and, accordingly, is more flexible than the first. We recently catalogued several situations in which a court might appropriately reconsider its past decision. <i>See Ellis v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200248\"><a href=\"/opinion/200248/ellis-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">313</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">636</span></a></span>, 647-48 (1st Cir.2002). Mrs. Moran asseverates that this case comes within that taxonomy as a case in which \"reconsideration may be appropriate to avoid manifest injustice.\" <i>Id.</i> at 648.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While <i>Ellis</i> recognized this exception &#8212; and we reaffirm its vitality &#8212; a litigant seeking to fit within its confines must negotiate a steep uphill climb. In this context, a finding of manifest injustice requires, at a bare minimum, \"a definite and firm conviction that a prior ruling on a material matter is unreasonable or obviously wrong,\" and resulted in prejudice. <i>Id.</i> at 648 &amp; n. 5. Mrs. Moran cannot scale these heights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In mounting her argument, Mrs. Moran relies exclusively on Chief Judge Boudin's concurring opinion in <i>Moran I.</i> What she seemingly fails to appreciate is that even the author of that concurrence concluded that there was sufficient evidence upon which to ground a conviction. <i>Moran I,</i> 312 F.3d at 495-96 (Boudin, C.J., concurring). That conclusion is antithetic to Mrs. Moran's claim that the concurrence necessitates (or even supports) a finding that the earlier panel opinion was, in the <i>Ellis</i> phrase, \"unreasonable or obviously wrong.\" <i>Ellis,</i> 313 F.3d at 648. Since Mrs. Moran points to no other authority to support such a finding, there is no basis for suspecting manifest injustice here. We therefore decline Mrs. Moran's invitation to disturb the decision in <i>Moran I.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Attempted Conversion.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A motion for a new trial in a federal criminal case, other than a motion alleging newly discovered evidence, must be filed within seven days next following the initial entry of judgment. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(2). Mr. Moran filed no such motion within the allotted interval. In an endeavor to repair this omission, he asseverates that the defendants' timely motion for judgment of acquittal should have been considered \"alternatively\" as a motion for new trial and that, therefore, the district court should have converted that Rule 29 motion into a Rule 33 motion for a new trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> This asseveration is hopeless.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion to which Mr. Moran alludes was captioned \"Motion[] for Judgment of Acquittal and for Additional Time to File Memoranda.\" The body of the motion reads in relevant part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">NOW COME defendants John and Nora Moran, through counsel, and pursuant to Rule 29 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure and hereby renew their motions for this Honorable Court to enter a judgment of acquittal as to all counts of the Superseding Indictment. In support thereof, counsel states the following:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p>...</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">6.... [T]he government failed to offer sufficient evidence upon which a rational jury could find the Defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of the crimes of bank fraud and conspiracy to commit bank fraud.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">7. The government's evidence is equally consistent with guilt as it is with innocence which requires a judgment of acquittal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">8. Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the government established that the Defendants violated bank policy and/or civil banking regulations, the government failed to introduce any other conduct which may form the basis for a bank fraud conviction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">9. The government has failed to prove intent on the part of the Defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">10. Assuming <i>arguendo</i> that the government has proven that the Defendants intended to defraud First American Bank, it failed to prove that their statements or omissions were material.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">WHEREFORE, based upon the foregoing arguing [sic] arguments and authorities this Honorable Court is respectfully urged to permit the Defendants additional time to file memoranda in support of the instant motion and to enter a judgment of acquittal as to all counts of the Superseding Indictment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mr. Moran suggests that this motion was sufficient to permit a judge to grant him a new trial based on the following syllogism: (i) the substance of a motion, not its title, controls; (ii) a motion pointing out that the government did not have enough evidence to convict a defendant, a priori, supports a claim that the weight of the evidence tipped greatly in the defendant's favor; (iii) such a weight-of-the-evidence finding would support the granting of a new trial; and so (iv) a motion seeking judgment of acquittal because of insufficient evidence &#8212; like Mr. Moran's motion &#8212; \"logically\" must encompass a request for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taken in the abstract, some of these premises are correct. For example, we have stated that \"[i]n addressing a post-judgment motion, a court is not bound by the label that the movant fastens to it\" and may \"reclassify the motion as its substance suggests.\" <i>Vasapolli v. Rostoff,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195712\"><a href=\"/opinion/195712/vasapolli-v-rostoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">39</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 36 (1st Cir.1994). So too a timely motion for new trial may be granted when \"evidence preponderates heavily against the verdict.\" <i>United States v. Wilkerson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199425\"><a href=\"/opinion/199425/united-states-v-wilkerson/\"><span class=\"volume\">251</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">273</span></a></span>, 278 (1st Cir.2001) (internal quotation marks omitted). But two swallows do not a summer make, and Mr. Moran's syllogism falls apart when one analyzes its conclusion: that a motion seeking a judgment of acquittal on sufficiency-of-the-evidence grounds necessarily must be read as requesting a consolation prize in the nature of a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That reading is neither logically compelled nor legally appropriate. Where the motion papers cannot be fairly construed as a request for a new trial, a district court does not have the authority, sua sponte, to convert a motion for judgment of acquittal into a motion for a new trial. <i>United States v. Navarro Viayra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785912\"><a href=\"/opinion/785912/united-states-v-miguel-navarro-viayra-manuel-alvarez-guerra/\"><span class=\"volume\">365</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">790</span></a></span>, 793 (9th Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"360969\"><a href=\"/opinion/360969/united-states-v-j-marshall-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">587</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">187</span></a></span>, 189 (5th Cir.1979). That choice is the defendant's &#8212; and the defendant's alone. What is more, it must be exercised within the time parameters prescribed by the Criminal Rules.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(2) specifies that a motion for new trial, other than a motion grounded on newly discovered evidence, must be filed within seven days of the jury verdict (i.e., the entry of judgment). That rule was amended in 1966 to \"make it clear that a judge has no power to order a new trial on his own motion\" once judgment has entered. Fed.R.Crim.P. 33 advisory committee notes (1966 Amendments). Simultaneously, the advisory committee made it pellucid that the Criminal Rules forbid an interpretation that would allow a district court, on its own initiative, to evade the temporal strictures of Rule 33 by reading into a Rule 29 motion for judgment of acquittal a request for a new trial, not solicited by the movant. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 29 advisory committee notes (1966 Amendments, Subdivision (c)) (explaining that Rule 29(c) precludes an interpretation that \"gives the [district] court power to order a new trial even though the defendant ... has not asked for one\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewed against this backdrop, it is transparently clear that even if a motion for judgment of acquittal contains a substantive basis sufficient to ground the grant of a new trial, a court is without power to treat the motion as a motion for a new trial unless it also contains some overt indication that the movant desires that relief. The motion in this case contained no such indication. It invoked Rule 29, not Rule 33, and the only relief requested was an outright acquittal. It was not until September 15, 1999 &#8212; well beyond the seven-day deadline &#8212; that Mr. Moran informed the district court of his desire for a new trial. That was too late.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That disposes of this assignment of error. The Criminal Rules gave Mr. Moran seven days within which to move for a new trial. He failed to seek that relief, and his timely motion for judgment of acquittal did not fill the void. Consequently, the district court acted appropriately both in denying Mr. Moran's belated conversion request and in refusing to grant a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>Ineffective Assistance of Counsel.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants next claim that the failure of their trial attorneys to file timely new trial motions constitutes ineffective assistance of counsel and, as such, justifies retrial. This claim, raised for the first time in this venue, is premature.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"We have held with a regularity bordering on the monotonous that fact-specific claims of ineffective assistance cannot make their debut on direct review of criminal convictions, but, rather, must originally be presented to, and acted upon by, the trial court.\" <i>United States v. Mala,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"194994\"><a href=\"/opinion/194994/united-states-v-mala/\"><span class=\"volume\">7</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1058</span></a></span>, 1063 (1st Cir.1993) (collecting cases). This rule is prudential in nature. A claim of ineffective assistance requires a showing that the attorney turned in a constitutionally deficient performance that prejudiced the defendant's substantial rights. <i>See Strickland v. Washington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">466</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">668</span></a></span>, 687, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111170\"><a href=\"/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Claims of this sort \"typically require the resolution of factual issues that cannot efficaciously be addressed in the first instance by an appellate tribunal.\" <i>Mala,</i> 7 F.3d at 1063. In addition, the insights of the trier, who has seen and heard the witnesses at first hand and watched the dynamics of the trial unfold, are often of great assistance. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

No ineffective assistance claim surfaced in the district court, and the record is barren of evidence as to why the lawyers did what they did. There are both tactical and strategic reasons why a party might seek a judgment of acquittal but not a new trial (for example, a fear that the prosecution will learn from its mistakes and put in a more persuasive case the second time around, a fear that the decisionmaker will take a request for acquittal less seriously if a possible compromise &#8212; such as a new trial &#8212; is on the table, or a fear that a shift in judges will lead to a stiffer sentence). Although hindsight is always 20/20, we cannot tell from this record whether the decision not to seek a new trial, <i>when made,</i> was a calculated stratagem or a mere oversight. Factfinding will be required to make that determination, which means that the district court should hear the claim in the first instance. <i>See, e.g., McGill,</i> 952 F.2d at 19.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add, moreover, that even if the failure to ask for a new trial betokens objectively unreasonable (and, therefore, constitutionally deficient) performance on the part of the lawyers &#8212; a matter on which we take no view &#8212; it remains to be determined whether any such failure was prejudicial within the meaning of <i>Strickland.</i> A finding of prejudice here would require a subsidiary finding that, but for the error, the moving defendant probably would have received a new trial. <i>See, e.g., Flores v.

We recognized the possibility of preclusion during oral argument and requested supplemental briefing on the point. The government, in its supplemental brief, has argued for preclusion &#8212; but its failure to raise the preclusion issue in a timely manner is reason enough to deem it waived. <i>See United States v.

When an appellee fails to contest a point that is irrelevant unless the main appeal results in reversal or remand, this court, even if a cross-appeal theoretically might have been possible, has been reluctant to find preclusion. <i>See Field,</i> 157 F.3d at 41-42 (abjuring preclusion based solely on a failure to file a \"procedurally dubious cross-appeal\" relating to what \"might [originally] have seemed an entirely redundant point\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Let us be perfectly clear. There are times when even an appellee who is defending an entirely favorable judgment must either raise an error purportedly committed by the district court or waive it. Typically, however, this occurs when correction of the error would provide either an alternate or an additional basis for affirmance of a favorable judgment. <i>See, e.g., Schering Corp. v. Ill. Antibiotics Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"721522\"><a href=\"/opinion/721522/schering-corporation-v-illinois-antibiotics-company-and-irving-s-rossoff/\"><span class=\"volume\">89</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">357</span></a></span>, 358-59 (7th Cir.1996). That is not the situation here: the defendants' newly asserted assignments of error &#8212; an ostensible flaw in the jury instructions and allegations of prosecutorial misconduct &#8212; are claims of legal error which, if sustained, would lead only to a retrial, not to an acquittal. Thus, even apart from the government's waiver, we would likely deem the defendants free to raise the assigned errors for the first time in this proceeding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Jury Instructions.</i> We turn next to the jury instructions.

Mrs. Moran asserts that this bifurcated closing argument so tainted the trial as to deny her due process. This assertion rests on four separate statements attributable to members of the prosecution team.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Moran maintains that the first two statements misstated the facts. During the initial phase of his summation, one prosecutor said:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If you go to Exhibit number 43, minutes of the Board of Directors, January of '87, Nora Moran is present. It talks about how the activities of the Executive Committee are brought up for presentation and the summarization by Mr. Murray. There was testimony they would be summarized, the individual loans might be talked about, they would be brought forth for review and approval. And the records affirmatively show Nora Moran was there that day. She voted in favor of the loan, her loan, involving Puente and Boersner and their finances and made no dissent, no abstention, no disclosure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Another prosecutor made essentially the same comment during the rebuttal phase of the summation. We treat these two statements together. Inasmuch as the defense did not interpose a contemporaneous objection on either occasion, we review only for plain error. <i>See Griffin,</i> 818 F.2d at 99-100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We discern no plain error. The evidence supported a reasonable inference that First American's board of directors voted on the Puente/Boersner loans. The evidence showed that the executive committee approved the loans in December; that the committee's custom and practice was to transmit a complete list of its approved loans to the board; that the board typically would consider, and vote on, the approved loans at the next month's board meeting; and that Mrs. Moran attended that meeting (held in January of 1987). No more was exigible to allow the argument to be proffered.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Moran suggests that these statements were improper based on the observations subsequently made by the district court in support of its entry of judgment of acquittal. In that decision, the court opined that, even had Mrs. Moran voted on the Puente/Boersner loans, the most that could be said was that she had voted to accept a summary report rather than to ratify or approve those particular loans (as the bank, by the time of the vote, already had committed, and largely disbursed, the funds).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Moran's suggestion is a non-sequitur. At the close of the evidence, the court allowed the case to go to the jury on a primary theory of liability having two strains &#8212; a voting theory and a non-disclosure theory &#8212; and a less prominent aiding and abetting theory. <i>Moran I,</i> 312 F.3d at 492 &amp; n. 14. This court found the voting theory insufficiently proven, but found the evidence adequate to support the verdict on both the non-disclosure theory and the aiding and abetting theory. <i>Id.</i> at 492-93.

If it does not offend due process to affirm a conviction even though one of several charged theories of guilt had an insufficient evidentiary predicate, <i>see Griffin,</i> 502 U.S. at 51, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112659\"><a href=\"/opinion/112659/griffin-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">112</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

To hold otherwise would eviscerate the <i>Griffin</i> doctrine.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Moran fares no better on the other aspect of her prosecutorial misconduct claim. This involves her insistence that the prosecutors twice misstated the law (once during the initial phase of the summation and again during the rebuttal phase) when it was said, in effect, that Mr. Moran could not make any legally exculpatory disclosures on behalf of his wife. Here, too, neither statement drew a contemporaneous objection, so appellate review is limited to plain error. <i>See Griffin,</i> 818 F.2d at 99-100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prevail under the four-part plain error regime, <i>see Duarte,</i> 246 F.3d at 60, Mrs. Moran's first obligation is to show that the prosecutors' statements were legally flawed. She has failed to make that showing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As said, there were three routes to finding that Mrs. Moran possessed the scienter necessary to have committed bank fraud. The voting theory implicated banking regulations, uniquely applicable to Mrs. Moran in her capacity as a director of the bank, which required her to inform her fellow directors about any loans in which she had a financial interest and to disqualify herself from voting on them. The non-disclosure theory implicated Mrs. Moran's duty, as the bank's fiduciary, to report her husband's double-dealing. The aiding and abetting theory implicated her knowing assistance to her husband's fraud. Under the latter two theories, Mrs. Moran's criminal intent was premised on knowledge that her husband had breached <i>his</i> ethical duties to the bank. This was what attracted Chief Judge Boudin's concern. <i>See Moran I,</i> 312 F.3d at 494-95 (Boudin, C.J., concurring).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This segmentation is critical to our disposition of this aspect of Mrs. Moran's prosecutorial misconduct claim, for the context of the challenged statements makes it clear that they referred to her personal obligation under the voting theory. The prosecutor was arguing, in effect, that Mrs. Moran's obligation to the board of directors could not be deemed satisfied by her husband's alleged disclosure to Noke. This argument restated competent testimony that such a disclosure was insufficient because Noke was a subordinate employee of the bank, not a fellow director. Viewed in this light, the challenged statements can be read as positing that even if Mr. Moran had fulfilled his ethical duty, Mrs. Moran knew that she had an independent, supervening duty to First American's board and nonetheless voted on the loans with full awareness that she had not satisfied that duty. We believe that was within the ambit of permissible advocacy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The worst that can be said is that this strain of argument was ambiguous; it was legally accurate as to one of the prosecution's theories of guilt, arguably inaccurate as to the others, and did not clearly differentiate among them. But context is important, and both times the prosecutor made the challenged statement, it served as the starting point of a discussion of the voting theory. We do \"not lightly infer that a prosecutor intends an ambiguous remark to have its most damaging meaning or that a jury, sitting through lengthy exhortation, will draw that meaning from the plethora of less damaging interpretations.\" <i>United States v. Lilly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"597801\"><a href=\"/opinion/597801/united-states-v-william-w-lilly/\"><span class=\"volume\">983</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">300</span></a></span>, 307 (1st Cir.1992) (quoting <i>Donnelly v. DeChristoforo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109024\"><a href=\"/opinion/109024/donnelly-v-dechristoforo/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span>, 647, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109024\"><a href=\"/opinion/109024/donnelly-v-dechristoforo/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">431</span></a></span> (1974)). We make no such inference here. Considering the context of the statements and the fact that no contemporaneous objection was lodged, we must give the prosecutor the benefit of the doubt. <i>See United States v. Taylor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196070\"><a href=\"/opinion/196070/united-states-v-taylor/\"><span class=\"volume\">54</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">967</span></a></span>, 979 (1st Cir.1995); <i>Lilly,</i> 983 F.2d at 307.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If more were needed &#8212; and we doubt that it is &#8212; we are satisfied that the judge's charge dispelled any possible confusion. The charge clearly differentiated among the government's three theories. It identified how the regulatory duties of Mrs. Moran, as a director, differed from the general fiduciary duties owed by both defendants, and limned the contours of the aiding and abetting theory. To cinch matters, the court explicitly instructed that \"if what [the attorneys] have said about the law seems to ... have a different meaning in any way from my instructions on the law, you must be guided only by my instructions.\" Under these circumstances, we are confident that any prejudice stemming from the challenged statements did not survive the court's charge. There was, therefore, no plain error. <i>See Taylor,</i> 54 F.3d at 977.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">III. CONCLUSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. For the reasons elucidated above, we affirm the convictions and sentences of both defendants. In so doing, however, we do not adjudicate the merits of the defendants' ineffective assistance of counsel claims. Those claims are dismissed without prejudice and may be resurrected, should either or both of the defendants so elect, in post-conviction proceedings under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2255. <i>See Mala,</i> 7 F.3d at 1064.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p76\">\n      <span class=\"num\">76</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The indictment contained a second, unrelated count of bank fraud against Mrs. Moran.

The<i>Moran I</i> panel did not rely on this evidence, <i>see</i> 312 F.3d at 492, and we do not dwell on it at this juncture.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> In October of 1999, the defendants jointly filed a separate motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence (specifically, alleged juror misconduct). That motion was timely<i>See</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 33(b)(1). However, the district court denied it on December 27, 1999. On appeal, the defendants do not attempt to challenge that ruling.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Although the Morans jointly filed the motion for judgment of acquittal, Mrs. Moran does not pursue this line of argument</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Mr. Moran's citation to<i>United States v.

The court neither described the contents of the motion nor explained what relief the defendant had sought. To the extent that <i>Baker</i> suggests that a district court can grant a new trial sua sponte after the entry of judgment in a criminal case, without a timely indication from the defendant that he desires one, its holding is flatly inconsistent with the Criminal Rules and, like the Ninth Circuit, <i>see Navarro Viayra,</i> 365 F.3d at 795, we respectfully decline to follow it.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> The fact that the district court originally granted the defendants' motion for judgment of acquittal is not an infallible harbinger of how motions for new trial would fare. The district court's judgment, informed by the opinion in<i>Moran I,</i> may well be different.
