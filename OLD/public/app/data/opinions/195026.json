Plaintiff-appellant,\n          BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judge.\n                                       \n\nThe Boston Beer Company, sought to enjoin defendant-appellee,\n\nBoston Beer Works, from using  the words \"Boston Beer\" in its\n\nname, and from using the word \"Boston\" in connection with any\n\nof  its beers.  Appellant contended  that appellee's name was\n\nconfusingly similar to  its own, and would mislead the public\n\ninto  thinking that Boston  Beer Works' products  or services\n\noriginated or were associated  with those of The Boston  Beer\n\nCompany.   The district court rejected this claim, concluding\n\nthat  appellant's marks \"Boston  Beer,\" as used  in its name,\n\nand  \"Boston,\" as  used in  connection with  a number  of its\n\nproducts,  were not  entitled to  trademark  protection.   We\n\naffirm.\n\n                              I.\n                                \n\n                          BACKGROUND\n                                    \n\n          Appellant  is  a   beer  manufacturer.    In   1985\n\nappellant  began brewing  Samuel  Adams  Boston  Lager  at  a\n\nbrewery in  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania under  the name  \"Boston\n\nBeer Company.\"   The  Pittsburgh  facility was  independently\n\nowned,  and appellant  operated  it  as  a  contract  brewer,\n\nnamely, one  who engages  another  to manufacture  beer in  a\n\nbrewery  owned  by  the  other.    Presently,  appellant  has\n\ncontract  breweries  in  Pittsburgh,  Utica,  New  York,  and\n\nPortland, Oregon.\n\n                             -2-\n                              2\n\n     In November 1988  appellant first began to brew  its own\n\nbeer at a brewery  located in Boston.   This also marked  the\n\nfirst  time that  appellant actually brewed  any beer  in the\n\ncity that  shares its name.   Appellant has,  however, always\n\ncalled Boston  its corporate home,  and virtually all  of its\n\nassets and non-sales employees can be found in Massachusetts.\n\n          Appellant's  \"Boston\"  brews  are  not  limited  to\n\nSamuel Adams  Boston Lager.   In fact, appellant has  what it\n\nrefers to as  a \"family\" of \"Boston\"  beers.  In  addition to\n\nSamuel Adams Boston  Lager, other members of  this family are\n\nBoston  Lightship,   which  appellant   began  marketing   in\n\nSeptember  1987, and Samuel Adams Boston Ale, which appellant\n\nbegan  marketing in  October 1988.1    Appellant's beers  are\n\nmarketed  and distributed  throughout the  United States  and\n\nabroad.   Appellant  sells its  beers  to restaurants,  bars,\n\npackage  stores and  grocery stores  for resale; it  does not\n\nmake any sales directly to the public.\n\n          Over  the  past  five  years  appellant  has  spent\n\nsubstantial  amounts of money  promoting its products  in the\n\nBoston  area.    From  1988  through  1992,  appellant  spent\n\n                    \n\n     1.  This  is not,  however,  the extent  of  appellant's\nbrews.  In  fact, appellant sports an entire  line of \"Samuel\nAdams\"  beers, including:   \"Samuel Adams  Cranberry Lambic,\"\n\"Samuel  Adams  Cream  Stout,\"  \"Samuel Adams  Double  Bock,\"\n\"Samuel  Adams  Triple  Bock,\"  \"Samuel  Adams  Oktoberfest,\"\n\"Samuel  Adams Wheat  Brew,\" \"Samuel  Adams  Winter Ale\"  and\n\"Samuel Adams Winter Lager.\"\n\n                             -3-\n                              3\n\napproximately $350,000  in advertising on major  Boston radio\n\nstations.  Among the various  other promotional means used by\n\nappellant are  billboards,  print advertising,  and sales  of\n\npromotional materials such as coasters, balloons, hats, table\n\ntents  and table  tent  holders.   By 1992  appellant's total\n\nsales  in the  Boston area  had exceeded  $3 million  and its\n\ntotal sales had exceeded $20 million.\n\n          Appellee is  a restaurant and  brew pub.   On April\n\n10, 1992, it  opened for business on Brookline  Avenue in the\n\nKenmore  Square section of Boston, directly across the street\n\nfrom Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox.  As a brew pub,\n\nappellee is a licensed restaurant that brews beer on-site for\n\nconsumption  by its  patrons.   One  of the  beers brewed  by\n\nappellee is named  \"Boston Red.\"  In addition  to brewing and\n\nserving its own beers, appellee offers a wide range of food.\n\n          Appellant commenced this  action on April 14,  1992\n\nalleging    trademark    and   trade    name    infringement,\n\nmisappropriation and  unfair competition pursuant  to   43(a)\n\nof the Lanham  Act, 15 U.S.C.   1125(a), the  general laws of\n\nthe Commonwealth of Massachusetts and  common law.  The first\n\namended  complaint  alleged,  inter   alia,  that  appellee's\n                                          \n\n\"adoption  of  `BOSTON  BEER WORKS'  made  with  knowledge of\n\nPlaintiff's prior use of the trademark and trade name `BOSTON\n\nBEER COMPANY'  and its  `BOSTON BRAND'  family of  trademarks\n\n....\" constitutes a  violation of   43(a) of  the Lanham Act.\n\n                             -4-\n                              4\n\nFirst Amended Complaint at   17.  On April 15 appellant moved\n\nfor a temporary restraining order to stop appellee from using\n\nthe names \"Boston  Beer Works\" and \"Boston Red.\"   The motion\n\nwas denied the same day.\n\n          On April  21  appellant  moved  for  a  preliminary\n\ninjunction.   After  two days  of hearings  and  argument the\n\ndistrict court denied the motion.   In a Memorandum and Order\n\ndated June  18, 1992  (the \"June  Memorandum\"), the  district\n\ncourt found that the  appellant's marks were not  entitled to\n\ntrademark2 protection.\n\n          The district  court found  first that  \"plaintiff's\n\n`BOSTON BEER' mark as used  in its name `BOSTON BEER COMPANY'\n\nis  sufficiently descriptive  so  as  not  to  be  considered\n\ngeneric  and  thus  unprotectable.\"   June  Memorandum  at 9.\n\nNext, the court found that \"plaintiff's `BOSTON' mark as used\n\nin its `SAMUEL ADAMS BOSTON' beers and its `BOSTON LIGHTSHIP'\n\nbeer  is a descriptive term.\"   In fact, the court found that\n\nappellant did not even  contend that its marks  were anything\n\nbut descriptive.  Id.   Therefore, the court stated, in order\n                     \n\nto  satisfy its  burden of  establishing that  its marks  are\n\n                    \n\n     2.  For purposes  of  this opinion,  the term  trademark\nincludes trade names as well.  Although there are differences\nbetween the  two concerning, inter  alia, registration  under\n                                        \nthe  Lanham  Act, the  differences  are not  relevant  to our\ndecision in  this case.   See Union National Bank,  Laredo v.\n                                                          \nUnion National Bank, Austin, 909  F.2d 839, 841 n.2 (5th Cir.\n                           \n1990)  (citing Blinded  Veterans Assoc.  v.  Blinded American\n                                                             \nVeterans  Foundation, 872  F.2d 1035,  1040  n.11 (D.C.  Cir.\n                    \n1989)).\n\n                             -5-\n                              5\n\nentitled  to trademark  protection,  \"[p]laintiff must  still\n\nmake a  showing, under a  likelihood standard, that  its name\n\nand marks have acquired secondary meaning.\"  Id.\n                                                \n\n          After reviewing the relevant preliminary injunction\n\nconsiderations, the court  concluded that appellant  had \"not\n\nshown a likelihood  of establishing by a preponderance of the\n\nevidence a secondary meaning for `BOSTON BEER' and `BOSTON.'\"\n\nId.  at 15.    Specifically, the  court  found that  although\n   \n\nappellant had been using  the name \"Boston Beer  Company\" and\n\nthe  term \"Boston\"  in connection  with  Samuel Adams  Boston\n\nLager since  late 1985,  not all  of appellant's  promotional\n\nmaterials contained \"The Boston Beer Company\" name, and those\n\nthat did,  always used it  along with another  of appellant's\n\nbeer marks.   \"For example,\"  the court pointed out,  \"on the\n\ncards plaintiff prints  to be inserted  into table tents  for\n\nrestaurants  and bars, the `BOSTON BEER COMPANY' name appears\n\non  the bottom  of the  card with plaintiff's  `SAMUEL ADAMS'\n\nlogo and its  slogan `The Best Beer in  America' appearing at\n\nthe top of the card.\"  June Memorandum at 11.   Moreover, the\n\ncourt found that  all of the promotions that  did include the\n\ncompany's  name,  \"place[d] the  name  on the  bottom  and in\n\nsmaller type  than the rest  of the words on  the promotional\n\nitem.\"  Id. \n           \n\n          As  far  as   the  labels  appearing  on   each  of\n\nappellant's  three  \"Boston\"  beers,  the  court  noted  that\n\n                             -6-\n                              6\n\n\"Boston\" did in fact appear in each of the beers' names.   In\n\naddition,  the  court  found that  each  beer's  bottle label\n\ncontained an illustration   or logo, and that,  on bottles of\n\nSamuel Adams  Boston Lager  and Boston  Lightship, the  words\n\n\"Samuel Adams\" and \"Lightship\" were in larger print  than the\n\nwords \"Boston  Lager\" and  \"Boston,\" respectively.   Finally,\n\nthe court found that the name \"Boston  Beer Company\" appeared\n\nat the  bottom of  all appellant's labels  in a  smaller type\n\nthan either the illustration or the other words on the label.\n\n          It  was   undisputed  that  appellant   engaged  in\n\nsubstantial  advertising and promotion of its products in the\n\nBoston  area.   The court  found,  however, that  appellant's\n\nefforts  were  \"focused  in  the  direction  of  promoting  a\n\nconnection   between    'SAMUEL   ADAMS'    and   plaintiff's\n\nproducts[,]\"  and  not  towards   establishing  a  connection\n\nbetween  the terms \"Boston  Beer\" and  \"Boston\" and  its beer\n\nproducts.  Id. at 15-16.  In reaching this  result, the court\n              \n\nexamined   appellant's   billboards,   radio  advertisements,\n\nvarious   promotional   paraphernalia,  and   a   promotional\n\nbrochure.   Finally,  the  court pointed  out  that the  vast\n\nmajority of  appellant's advertising is directed  towards its\n\nbest-selling  brand,  Samuel  Adams Boston  Lager,  and  that\n\nappellant  produces other \"Samuel  Adams\" beers that  are not\n\npart of its \"Boston\" family.  As the court also observed,\n\n          [t]he fact that  plaintiff produces other\n          Samuel Adams beers, with  the same Samuel\n\n                             -7-\n                              7\n\n          Adams  logo  as  appears on  its  \"Samuel\n          Adams  Boston  Lager\" and  \"Samuel  Adams\n          Boston Ale\" beer labels, but without  the\n          \"BOSTON\"   family   name,   reduces   the\n          likelihood that a consumer will associate\n          \"BOSTON\"    or    \"BOSTON    BEER\"   with\n          plaintiff's products.\n\nJune Memorandum at 14-15.   In summary, the court found that,\n\nnotwithstanding  the  duration  of  appellant's  use  of  the\n\n\"Boston  Beer  Company\"   name  and  the  term   \"Boston\"  in\n\nconnection with  three of its  products, it had  not directed\n\nits  advertising  and promotional  activities  to  creating a\n\nconnection  between \"Boston Beer\"  and its products,  and had\n\nnot made efforts  at promoting a connection  between \"Boston\"\n\nand its products, and therefore it had not shown a likelihood\n\nof establishing secondary meaning.\n\n          On February  9 and 10,  1993 a  non-jury trial  was\n\nheld, at the conclusion of  which the court gave its decision\n\nfrom the bench.  The sole issues litigated were:  (1) whether\n\nsecondary meaning had attached to \"Boston\" and \"Boston Beer,\"\n\nand (2) if  so, whether  a likelihood  of consumer  confusion\n\nexisted.  Appellant's  principal evidence at  trial consisted\n\nof a consumer survey.  \n\n          The survey was conducted  among 400 \"beer drinkers\"\n\nfrom the greater-Boston  area who were split  into two groups\n\nof  200.     Each  group  was  provided  with   a  choice  of\n\napproximately  20 beers  and asked  to identify  the  beer or\n\nbeers produced by  each of three different  \"beer companies.\"\n\n                             -8-\n                              8\n\nBoth  groups were asked  about the \"Latrobe  Brewing Company\"\n\nand the \"Anheuser-Busch company.\"   One group was asked about\n\nBoston Beer Company  and the other  about Boston Beer  Works.\n\nIncluded  on the list  were appellant's three  \"Boston\" beers\n\nwhich  appeared as  \"Samuel Adams  beer,\"  \"Boston Ale,\"  and\n\n\"Lightship.\"  The  other beers consisted of  various domestic\n\nand imported brands.\n\n          When  asked  what  brand of  beer  was  produced by\n\nBoston  Beer Company, 36%  responded with Samuel  Adams beer.\n\nBoston  Ale and Lightship each garnered 4%, and 59% responded\n\nthat they did not know.  Similarly, for the group asked about\n\nBoston Beer  Works, 31% responded with Samuel  Adams, 4% with\n\nBoston  Ale, 2%  Lightship  and 66%  could  not identify  any\n\nbrand.\n\n          After hearing all of the evidence, the court found:\n\n          The  principal  difference   between  the\n          evidence that  was before me at  the time\n          of the preliminary injunction hearing and\n          the  evidence that  is before  me in  the\n          full  development  of  the case  here  on\n          trial  is  the  addition  of  the  survey\n          evidence that the  plaintiff has offered.\n          I find  that  that is  not sufficient  to\n          establish a secondary  meaning and indeed\n          as  fact finder I  find that it  does not\n          even  strongly  support an  inference  of\n          secondary meaning.\n\n          The court went on to identify what it felt were two\n\nproblems  with the  survey.   First  it  had trouble  drawing\n\ninferences  favorable to  appellant from  the survey  because\n\n                             -9-\n                              9\n\nparticipants were  told  that they  were  going to  be  asked\n\nquestions about beer \"companies\" as opposed to a neutral term\n\nsuch as \"producers\" or \"brewers.\"\n\n          Second  and more  importantly,  the district  court\n\nfound  that the survey results simply  did not provide strong\n\nsupport for an inference of  secondary meaning.  In a lengthy\n\ncolloquy with  appellant's trial  counsel the  district court\n\nexplained that \"[a] strong inference I draw from this is that\n\nwhen the interviewee is prompted by three words, two of which\n\nare 'Boston  Beer,' a  third of them  come back  with 'Samuel\n\nAdams'.\"    \"Is that  enough\"  the  court queried,  \"if  [the\n\ninterviewees are] just associating Samuel Adams with somebody\n\nwho produces beer in  Boston ....\"  In other words, the court\n\nfound  that the  survey  provided a  strong  inference of  an\n\nassociation  between  product  and  place,  but  not  between\n\nproduct and source.3   This association, the  court believed,\n\nexplained the fact that similar percentages associated Samuel\n\nAdams with Boston Beer Company and Boston Beer Works.\n\n          According to the court, the results\n\n          support[ed] an inference  of uncertainty,\n          if not confusion,  as between Boston Beer\n          Works and Boston  Beer Company, but  that\n          is  not the issue that is decisive of the\n\n                    \n\n     3.  On this point, the district court commented:  \"Well,\ndon't people associate Samuel Adams with Boston, at least any\nof them  who  have their  American  history course  still  in\nmind?\"  The  court added that this might  particularly be the\ncase  with,    \"upper-scale  Samuel  Adams beer  drinkers[.]\"\nAppendix at 608.\n\n                             -10-\n                              10\n\n          adequacy  of the  evidence  before me  to\n          show secondary meaning.   So taking  into\n          account that evidence along with all  the\n          other  evidence before  me, I  find  by a\n          preponderance of the  evidence that there\n          has  not  been  an  establishment  of   a\n          secondary  meaning  that  associates  the\n          product with Boston Beer Company.\n\nBecause  the trial court  found that appellant  had failed to\n\nmeet its burden on secondary meaning, the court did not reach\n\nthe issue of likelihood of confusion.  This appeal followed.\n\n                             II.\n                                \n\n                          DISCUSSION\n                                    \n\n          Appellant argues that the  district court committed\n\nlegal  error by failing  to make an  independent finding that\n\nthe marks lack  \"inherent distinctiveness,\" to go  along with\n\nits finding that  the marks \"Boston\"  and \"Boston Beer\"  were\n\ndescriptive.  Alternatively, appellant contends that, even if\n\nthe court did not commit any  legal error on this front,  its\n\nfinding that the marks are descriptive was clearly erroneous.\n\nNext, appellant argues that the district court's finding that\n\nthe survey was not highly probative of secondary  meaning was\n\nclearly erroneous.   Alternatively,  appellant contends  that\n\nthe  district court misunderstood  the doctrine  of secondary\n\nmeaning.  Finally, appellant argues that the survey, standing\n\nalone  or together  with the  other  evidence, established  a\n\nlikelihood of confusion as a matter of law, and therefore the\n\ncourt's finding that  its marks lacked secondary  meaning was\n\nillogical.\n\n                             -11-\n                              11\n\n          Neither mark over which appellant asserts exclusive\n\nrights  -  \"Boston  Beer\"  and  \"Boston\"  -  are  registered.\n\nTherefore  the present  claim is  based upon    43(a)  of the\n\nLanham Act  which covers unregistered  trademarks.4   Section\n\n43(a) prohibits any person from using\n\n          in connection with any  goods ... or  any\n          container for goods, ... any word,  term,\n          name,   symbol,   or   device,   or   any\n          combination  thereof  ...  which  ...  is\n          likely to  cause confusion,  or to  cause\n          mistake,  or  to deceive  ...  as to  the\n          origin, sponsorship,  or approval  of his\n          or her goods ... by another person.\n\n15 U.S.C.    1125(a).   It  is settled  that    43(a) of  the\n\nLanham Act  protects qualifying unregistered marks,  and that\n\nthe  general  principles qualifying  a mark  for registration\n\nunder    2  of the  Lanham  Act are  generally applicable  in\n\ndetermining  whether  an  unregistered  mark  is  entitled to\n\nprotection under    43(a).

A trademark is  defined as \"any word,  name, symbol,\nor device,  or any  combination thereof used  by a  person to\nidentify and distinguish his or her goods, including a unique\nproduct, from  those manufactured  or sold  by others and  to\nindicate  the source  of the  goods, even  if that  source is\nunknown.\"  15 U.S.C.   1127.\n\n                             -12-\n                              12\n\nnever be protected.

Inherent Distinctiveness\n                            \n\n          At  the outset,  appellant contends that  its marks\n\nare inherently  distinctive, as  opposed to descriptive,  and\n\nare therefore entitled to  trademark protection without proof\n\nof secondary  meaning.   Because we  hold that appellant  has\n\nfailed  to preserve the issue of inherent distinctiveness for\n\nappeal, we decline to reach the merits of its contentions.\n\n          The   law  in  this  circuit  is  crystalline:    a\n\nlitigant's  failure to explicitly  raise an issue  before the\n\ndistrict court forecloses  that party from raising  the issue\n\nfor the  first time  on appeal.   See McCoy  v. Massachusetts\n                                                             \n\nInstitute of  Technology, 950  F.2d 13,  22 (1st  Cir. 1991),\n                        \n\ncert. denied, 112 S.

From the  very  outset of  this\n\nlitigation appellant had pitched its case on the theory  that\n\nits  marks are descriptive, that they have attained secondary\n\nmeaning, and are thus entitled to trademark protection.   The\n\ntrial  below proceeded on  the common understanding  that the\n\nmarks  were  descriptive;  and  appellant  acknowledged  that\n\nsecondary meaning and  likelihood of confusion were  the only\n\ntriable  issues.     Moreover,  after  rendering  its   bench\n\ndecision, the trial  court asked appellant if  any additional\n\nfindings  were  necessary in  order  to  address all  of  its\n\nclaims, and  appellant did not request a  finding on inherent\n\ndistinctiveness.\n\n          According to appellant, it  preserved this issue by\n\nunderlining, and  thereby objecting  to, appellee's  proposed\n\npre-trial  finding that the marks were \"neither arbitrary nor\n\nfanciful.\"   Appendix  at 444.    We have  little trouble  in\n\nfinding  that the  act  of  underlining  is  insufficient  to\n\npreserve  this  issue  for appeal.

Because  we see  no  reason to  diverge from  our\n\ncustomary practice, we treat this argument as waived.\n\nB.

Secondary meaning\n\n          refers to a word's, or a sign's,  ability\n          to  tell the public that the word or sign\n          serves  a  special   trademark  function,\n          namely,  that  it  denotes a  product  or\n          service  that  comes  from  a  particular\n          source.

The  court's\n\nfinding, that the survey results  demonstrate a product-place\n\nassociation  as opposed to  a product-source  association, is\n                                            \n\nnot  inconsistent with  the survey  results,  and provides  a\n\nviable alternative to the explanation proffered by appellant.\n\n          Just  because  one-third  of those  surveyed,  when\n\npresented  with a  list  of  beers and  a  brewer whose  name\n\ncontained the words  \"Boston Beer,\" matched that  brewer with\n\nSamuel Adams  beer,  does not  mean  that the  words  \"Boston\n\nBeer,\"  used  in  connection  with  appellant's   name,  have\n\nnecessarily  assumed  a secondary  meaning.   It  is  just as\n           \n\nprobable, as  the  district  court  lucidly  explained,  that\n\nappellant's marks  are still primarily perceived by consumers\n\nas geographically  descriptive terms, and that  consumers are\n\nsimply  aware of  the  fact  that Samuel  Adams  is a  Boston\n\nbeer.5   Moreover,  the  district  court  observed  that  the\n\n                    \n\n     5.  Even assuming that appellant's reading of the survey\nresults is the  correct one, a positive response  rate of 36%\nis hardly  overwhelming.   See generally  Callmann, supra,   \n                                                         \n\n                             -20-\n                              20\n\nsurvey was somewhat suggestive in that it gave the impression\n\nthat Boston Beer  Works was a \"company,\"  like Anheuser-Busch\n\nand Latrobe, as opposed to a restaurant/brew pub.\n\n          Furthermore,    if    the    survey   unequivocally\n\nestablishes  secondary meaning in the marks \"Boston Beer\" and\n\n\"Boston,\"  then we are at a  loss to understand why, when 36%\n\nof those surveyed thought that  Samuel Adams beer was  brewed\n\nby The Boston Beer Company, only 4% of the same group thought\n\nthat Boston  Ale was also produced by  that company.6  If the\n\nmarks  have acquired secondary  meaning, the same  people who\n\nselected Samuel Adams as one of appellant's brews should have\n\nselected Boston Ale as well.\n\n          Because  the district  court's ultimate  finding on\n\nsecondary  meaning  was  based   upon  its  consideration  of\n\ncircumstantial as well as direct evidence, we briefly discuss\n\nthe former.   We have already set forth  the relevant factors\n\nfor considering circumstantial evidence of secondary meaning,\n\nas  well  as the  district court's  thorough analysis  of the\n\nevidence thereunder.   The district court's finding  that the\n\ncircumstantial evidence  of secondary meaning did not support\n\nan inference favorable to appellant is well-supported.\n\n                    \n\n19.27.50 at 205 (collecting cases).\n\n     6.  Additionally,  it is  possible  that  there  was  no\noverlap between the people who selected Samuel Adams beer and\nthose who selected Boston Ale.\n\n                             -21-\n                              21\n\n          After   reviewing   the  entire   record,   placing\n\nparticular emphasis  on appellant's  survey, we  can find  no\n\nerror,  clear or otherwise,  in the district  court's finding\n\nthat   appellant  failed  to  carry  its  burden  of  proving\n\nsecondary meaning.\n\n          Next  appellant   argues  that   the  trial   court\n\ncommitted  legal error by \"rejecting\" the survey for \"failure\n\nto show any consumer identification of `company'.\"  According\n\nto appellant this  was a mistake because the  Lanham Act does\n\nnot  require that the  consumer actually know  the producer's\n\nname.  As  a preliminary matter, appellant  is incorrect when\n\nit states that the district court \"rejected\" the survey.  The\n\ndistrict court accepted the survey  into evidence and gave it\n\ncareful consideration  before concluding that the  survey did\n\nnot provide a basis for a finding of secondary meaning.\n\n          Furthermore,  appellant  incorrectly  attributes  a\n\nlegal  error  to  the  court.    At  the  risk  of  repeating\n\nourselves,  the district court  found that appellant  had not\n\nmet its burden of proving that its marks had come to identify\n\na single  source of beer  as opposed to simply  identifying a\n\ngeographic  origin.   This  finding  does  not rest  upon  an\n\nerroneous view of the law.\n\n          Finally, appellant  tries  to  execute  an  end-run\n\naround the  district  court's finding  on secondary  meaning.\n\nAppellant maintains  that because the  survey demonstrates  a\n\n                             -22-\n                              22\n\nlikelihood  of consumer  confusion  between  The Boston  Beer\n\nCompany  and  its products  and  Boston  Beer Works  and  its\n\nproducts,  secondary meaning  must exist.   While it  is true\n\nthat a finding of a  likelihood of confusion could only occur\n\nin this case if secondary meaning had attached to appellant's\n\nmarks,  appellant's  argument  places  the  cart  before  the\n\nClydesdale. \n\n          The  district court  found  that appellant's  marks\n\nwere  not entitled to  trademark protection because  they had\n\nnot  attained secondary meaning.  Accordingly, that court did\n\nnot need to address the  question of likelihood of confusion.\n\nThe determination  as to  whether a  likelihood of  confusion\n\nexists is a question of fact.  See Aktiebolaget Electrolux v.\n                                                          \n\nArmatron  International, Inc., 999 F.2d 1,  3 (1st Cir. 1993)\n                             \n\n(citing  Keds Corp. v.

Appellant contended that appellee's name was confusingly similar to its own, and would mislead the public into thinking that Boston Beer Works' products or services originated or were associated with those of The Boston Beer Company.  The district court rejected this claim, concluding that appellant's marks \"Boston Beer,\" as used in its name, and \"Boston,\" as used in connection with a number of its products, were not entitled to trademark protection.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant is a beer manufacturer.  In 1985 appellant began brewing Samuel Adams Boston Lager at a brewery in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania under the name \"Boston Beer Company.\"   The Pittsburgh facility was independently owned, and appellant operated it as a contract brewer, namely, one who engages another to manufacture beer in a brewery owned by the other.  Presently, appellant has contract breweries in Pittsburgh, Utica, New York, and Portland, Oregon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1988 appellant first began to brew its own beer at a brewery located in Boston.  This also marked the first time that appellant actually brewed any beer in the city that shares its name.  Appellant has, however, always called Boston its corporate home, and virtually all of its assets and non-sales employees can be found in Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's \"Boston\" brews are not limited to Samuel Adams Boston Lager.  In fact, appellant has what it refers to as a \"family\" of \"Boston\" beers.  In addition to Samuel Adams Boston Lager, other members of this family are Boston Lightship, which appellant began marketing in September 1987, and Samuel Adams Boston Ale, which appellant began marketing in October 1988.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Appellant's beers are marketed and distributed throughout the United States and abroad.  Appellant sells its beers to restaurants, bars, package stores and grocery stores for resale;  it does not make any sales directly to the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the past five years appellant has spent substantial amounts of money promoting its products in the Boston area.  From 1988 through 1992, appellant spent approximately $350,000 in advertising on major Boston radio stations.  Among the various other promotional means used by appellant are billboards, print advertising, and sales of promotional materials such as coasters, balloons, hats, table tents and table tent holders.  By 1992 appellant's total sales in the Boston area had exceeded $3 million and its total sales had exceeded $20 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee is a restaurant and brew pub.  On April 10, 1992, it opened for business on Brookline Avenue in the Kenmore Square section of Boston, directly across the street from Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox.  As a brew pub, appellee is a licensed restaurant that brews beer on-site for consumption by its patrons.  One of the beers brewed by appellee is named \"Boston Red.\"   In addition to brewing and serving its own beers, appellee offers a wide range of food.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant commenced this action on April 14, 1992 alleging trademark and trade name infringement, misappropriation and unfair competition pursuant to Sec. 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1125(a), the general laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and common law.  The first amended complaint alleged, inter alia, that appellee's \"adoption of 'BOSTON BEER WORKS' made with knowledge of Plaintiff's prior use of the trademark and trade name 'BOSTON BEER COMPANY' and its 'BOSTON BRAND' family of trademarks....\" constitutes a violation of Sec. 43(a) of the Lanham Act.  First Amended Complaint at p 17.  On April 15 appellant moved for a temporary restraining order to stop appellee from using the names \"Boston Beer Works\" and \"Boston Red.\"   The motion was denied the same day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 21 appellant moved for a preliminary injunction.  After two days of hearings and argument the district court denied the motion.  In a Memorandum and Order dated June 18, 1992 (the \"June Memorandum\"), the district court found that the appellant's marks were not entitled to trademark<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found first that \"plaintiff's 'BOSTON BEER' mark as used in its name 'BOSTON BEER COMPANY' is sufficiently descriptive so as not to be considered generic and thus unprotectable.\"   June Memorandum at 9.  Next, the court found that \"plaintiff's 'BOSTON' mark as used in its 'SAMUEL ADAMS BOSTON' beers and its 'BOSTON LIGHTSHIP' beer is a descriptive term.\"   In fact, the court found that appellant did not even contend that its marks were anything but descriptive.  Id.  Therefore, the court stated, in order to satisfy its burden of establishing that its marks are entitled to trademark protection, \"[p]laintiff must still make a showing, under a likelihood standard, that its name and marks have acquired secondary meaning.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the relevant preliminary injunction considerations, the court concluded that appellant had \"not shown a likelihood of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence a secondary meaning for 'BOSTON BEER' and 'BOSTON.' \"   Id. at 15.  Specifically, the court found that although appellant had been using the name \"Boston Beer Company\" and the term \"Boston\" in connection with Samuel Adams Boston Lager since late 1985, not all of appellant's promotional materials contained \"The Boston Beer Company\" name, and those that did, always used it along with another of appellant's beer marks.  \"For example,\" the court pointed out, \"on the cards plaintiff prints to be inserted into table tents for restaurants and bars, the 'BOSTON BEER COMPANY' name appears on the bottom of the card with plaintiff's 'SAMUEL ADAMS' logo and its slogan 'The Best Beer in America' appearing at the top of the card.\"   June Memorandum at 11.  Moreover, the court found that all of the promotions that did include the company's name, \"place[d] the name on the bottom and in smaller type than the rest of the words on the promotional item.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As far as the labels appearing on each of appellant's three \"Boston\" beers, the court noted that \"Boston\" did in fact appear in each of the beers' names.  In addition, the court found that each beer's bottle label contained an illustration or logo, and that, on bottles of Samuel Adams Boston Lager and Boston Lightship, the words \"Samuel Adams\" and \"Lightship\" were in larger print than the words \"Boston Lager\" and \"Boston,\" respectively.  Finally, the court found that the name \"Boston Beer Company\" appeared at the bottom of all appellant's labels in a smaller type than either the illustration or the other words on the label.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was undisputed that appellant engaged in substantial advertising and promotion of its products in the Boston area.  The court found, however, that appellant's efforts were \"focused in the direction of promoting a connection between 'SAMUEL ADAMS' and plaintiff's products[,]\" and not towards establishing a connection between the terms \"Boston Beer\" and \"Boston\" and its beer products.  Id. at 15-16.  In reaching this result, the court examined appellant's billboards, radio advertisements, various promotional paraphernalia, and a promotional brochure.  Finally, the court pointed out that the vast majority of appellant's advertising is directed towards its best-selling brand, Samuel Adams Boston Lager, and that appellant produces other \"Samuel Adams\" beers that are not part of its \"Boston\" family.  As the court also observed,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>[t]he fact that plaintiff produces other Samuel Adams beers, with the same Samuel Adams logo as appears on its \"Samuel Adams Boston Lager\" and \"Samuel Adams Boston Ale\" beer labels, but without the \"BOSTON\" family name, reduces the likelihood that a consumer will associate \"BOSTON\" or \"BOSTON BEER\" with plaintiff's products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">June Memorandum at 14-15.  In summary, the court found that, notwithstanding the duration of appellant's use of the \"Boston Beer Company\" name and the term \"Boston\" in connection with three of its products, it had not directed its advertising and promotional activities to creating a connection between \"Boston Beer\" and its products, and had not made efforts at promoting a connection between \"Boston\" and its products, and therefore it had not shown a likelihood of establishing secondary meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 9 and 10, 1993 a non-jury trial was held, at the conclusion of which the court gave its decision from the bench.  The sole issues litigated were:  (1) whether secondary meaning had attached to \"Boston\" and \"Boston Beer,\" and (2) if so, whether a likelihood of consumer confusion existed.  Appellant's principal evidence at trial consisted of a consumer survey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The survey was conducted among 400 \"beer drinkers\" from the greater-Boston area who were split into two groups of 200.  Each group was provided with a choice of approximately 20 beers and asked to identify the beer or beers produced by each of three different \"beer companies.\"   Both groups were asked about the \"Latrobe Brewing Company\" and the \"Anheuser-Busch company.\"   One group was asked about Boston Beer Company and the other about Boston Beer Works.  Included on the list were appellant's three \"Boston\" beers which appeared as \"Samuel Adams beer,\" \"Boston Ale,\" and \"Lightship.\"   The other beers consisted of various domestic and imported brands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked what brand of beer was produced by Boston Beer Company, 36% responded with Samuel Adams beer.  Boston Ale and Lightship each garnered 4%, and 59% responded that they did not know.  Similarly, for the group asked about Boston Beer Works, 31% responded with Samuel Adams, 4% with Boston Ale, 2% Lightship and 66% could not identify any brand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing all of the evidence, the court found:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>The principal difference between the evidence that was before me at the time of the preliminary injunction hearing and the evidence that is before me in the full development of the case here on trial is the addition of the survey evidence that the plaintiff has offered.  I find that that is not sufficient to establish a secondary meaning and indeed as fact finder I find that it does not even strongly support an inference of secondary meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court went on to identify what it felt were two problems with the survey.  First it had trouble drawing inferences favorable to appellant from the survey because participants were told that they were going to be asked questions about beer \"companies\" as opposed to a neutral term such as \"producers\" or \"brewers.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second and more importantly, the district court found that the survey results simply did not provide strong support for an inference of secondary meaning.  In a lengthy colloquy with appellant's trial counsel the district court explained that \"[a] strong inference I draw from this is that when the interviewee is prompted by three words, two of which are 'Boston Beer,' a third of them come back with 'Samuel Adams'.\"  \"Is that enough\" the court queried, \"if [the interviewees are] just associating Samuel Adams with somebody who produces beer in Boston....\"  In other words, the court found that the survey provided a strong inference of an association between product and place, but not between product and source.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  This association, the court believed, explained the fact that similar percentages associated Samuel Adams with Boston Beer Company and Boston Beer Works.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">According to the court, the results</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>support[ed] an inference of uncertainty, if not confusion, as between Boston Beer Works and Boston Beer Company, but that is not the issue that is decisive of the adequacy of the evidence before me to show secondary meaning.  So taking into account that evidence along with all the other evidence before me, I find by a preponderance of the evidence that there has not been an establishment of a secondary meaning that associates the product with Boston Beer Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the trial court found that appellant had failed to meet its burden on secondary meaning, the court did not reach the issue of likelihood of confusion.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the district court committed legal error by failing to make an independent finding that the marks lack \"inherent distinctiveness,\" to go along with its finding that the marks \"Boston\" and \"Boston Beer\" were descriptive.  Alternatively, appellant contends that, even if the court did not commit any legal error on this front, its finding that the marks are descriptive was clearly erroneous.  Next, appellant argues that the district court's finding that the survey was not highly probative of secondary meaning was clearly erroneous.  Alternatively, appellant contends that the district court misunderstood the doctrine of secondary meaning.  Finally, appellant argues that the survey, standing alone or together with the other evidence, established a likelihood of confusion as a matter of law, and therefore the court's finding that its marks lacked secondary meaning was illogical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither mark over which appellant asserts exclusive rights--\"Boston Beer\" and \"Boston\"--are registered.  Therefore the present claim is based upon Sec. 43(a) of the Lanham Act which covers unregistered trademarks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Section 43(a) prohibits any person from using</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>in connection with any goods ... or any container for goods, ... any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof ... which ... is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive ... as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods ... by another person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. Sec. 1125(a).  It is settled that Sec. 43(a) of the Lanham Act protects qualifying unregistered marks, and that the general principles qualifying a mark for registration under Sec. 2 of the Lanham Act are generally applicable in determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled to protection under Sec. 43(a).  Two Pesos, Inc. v. Taco Cabana, Inc., --- U.S. ----, ----, 112 S.Ct. 2753, 2757, 120 L.Ed.2d 615 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A court's inquiry into whether a term merits trademark protection starts with the classification of that term along the spectrum of \"distinctiveness.\"   At one end of the spectrum there are generic terms that have passed into common usage to identify a product, such as aspirin, and can never be protected.  Two Pesos, at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2757;  Miller Brewing Co. v. Falstaff Brewing Corp., 655 F.2d 5, 7-8 (1st Cir.1981).  In the middle there are so-called descriptive terms, such as a geographical term, which can be protected, but only if it has acquired \"secondary meaning\" by which consumers associate it with a particular producer or source.

At the other end of the spectrum, there are suggestive, arbitrary and fanciful terms that can be protected without proof of secondary meaning.  These terms are considered \"inherently distinctive.\"  Two Pesos, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2757;  see Wiley v. American Greetings Corp., 762 F.2d 139, 141 (1st Cir.1985) (\"a design is considered 'inherently distinctive' if it is fanciful or arbitrary\") (footnotes omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once the determination has been made that a term is entitled to trademark protection, the pivotal inquiry becomes whether the allegedly infringing mark is likely to cause consumer confusion.  See Boston Athletic Assoc. v. Sullivan, 867 F.2d 22, 28 (1st Cir.1989);  Wheeler, 814 F.2d at 817.   That is, whether a consumer is likely to believe that Boston Beer Works' products are in fact produced by The Boston Beer Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether a term is generic, descriptive, or inherently distinctive is a question of fact.  See Wiley, 762 F.2d at 141.   Similarly, whether a mark has acquired secondary meaning is also a question of fact.  Wheeler, 814 F.2d at 816.   Accordingly, the district court's findings on both of these questions are subject to review only for clear error.  Atlantic Track &amp; Turnout Co. v. Perini Corp., 989 F.2d 541, 543 (1st Cir.1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As this court has previously noted, \"[t]he clear error hurdle is ... quite high.\"  Lenn v. Portland School Committee, 998 F.2d 1083, 1087 (1st Cir.1993).  Of course, a district court's rulings of law are reviewed de novo.  Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Inherent Distinctiveness</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the outset, appellant contends that its marks are inherently distinctive, as opposed to descriptive, and are therefore entitled to trademark protection without proof of secondary meaning.  Because we hold that appellant has failed to preserve the issue of inherent distinctiveness for appeal, we decline to reach the merits of its contentions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The law in this circuit is crystalline:  a litigant's failure to explicitly raise an issue before the district court forecloses that party from raising the issue for the first time on appeal.  See McCoy v. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir.1991), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 112 S.Ct. 1939, 118 L.Ed.2d 545 (1992).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After scouring the record, we have failed to uncover a single instance, either orally or through submission, where appellant advocated that its marks were anything but descriptive.  From the very outset of this litigation appellant had pitched its case on the theory that its marks are descriptive, that they have attained secondary meaning, and are thus entitled to trademark protection.  The trial below proceeded on the common understanding that the marks were descriptive;  and appellant acknowledged that secondary meaning and likelihood of confusion were the only triable issues.  Moreover, after rendering its bench decision, the trial court asked appellant if any additional findings were necessary in order to address all of its claims, and appellant did not request a finding on inherent distinctiveness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to appellant, it preserved this issue by underlining, and thereby objecting to, appellee's proposed pretrial finding that the marks were \"neither arbitrary nor fanciful.\"   Appendix at 444.  We have little trouble in finding that the act of underlining is insufficient to preserve this issue for appeal.  See Rodriguez-Pinto v. Tirado-Delgado, 982 F.2d 34, 41 (1st Cir.1993) (\"arguments made in a perfunctory manner below are deemed waived on appeal\").  Because we see no reason to diverge from our customary practice, we treat this argument as waived.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Secondary Meaning</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because appellant's marks are descriptive, they are entitled to trademark protection only upon a showing of secondary meaning.  Secondary meaning</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p>refers to a word's, or a sign's, ability to tell the public that the word or sign serves a special trademark function, namely, that it denotes a product or service that comes from a particular source.

Commerce Southwest, Inc., 741 F.2d 785, 787 (5th Cir.1984) (evidentiary burden necessary to establish secondary meaning for a geographically descriptive term is substantial).

See Perini Corp., 915 F.2d at 125.  \"But secondary meaning cannot be recognized where, despite a degree of association between the mark and the producer, the original meaning remains dominant;  so long as the mark remains descriptive in its primary significance, subsidiary connotations cannot justify trademark treatment.\"   R. Callmann, Unfair Competition, Trademarks and Monopolies, Sec. 19.26 at 144 (4th ed. 1989);  see Burke-Parsons-Bowlby Corp., 871 F.2d at 595 (geographically descriptive term lacks secondary meaning if it still primarily denotes a geographic area as opposed to a single source).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the factors this court generally looks to in determining whether a term has acquired secondary meaning are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>(1) the length and manner of its use, (2) the nature and extent of advertising and promotion of the mark and (3) the efforts made in the direction of promoting a conscious connection, in the public's mind, between the name or mark and a particular product or venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wheeler, 814 F.2d at 816 (quoting Volkswagenwerk AG v. Rickard, 492 F.2d at 478).   Proof relating to these factors constitutes circumstantial evidence from which a court must draw reasonable inferences.  In its bench decision, the district court found, and appellant does not dispute, that, except for the survey, the evidence of secondary meaning was not materially different at trial than it was at the preliminary injunction hearing.  The court then concluded that the addition of the survey to the circumstantial evidence did not alter its prior findings, and that appellant had not met its burden of establishing secondary meaning.  In its brief appellant does not explicitly address the court's earlier findings.  Instead, appellant alleges that the court's treatment of the survey is grounds for reversing its finding on secondary meaning.  We turn to the survey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Survey evidence has become a well-recognized means of establishing secondary meaning.  See President and Trustees of Colby College, 508 F.2d at 809;  PaperCutter, Inc. v. Fay's Drug Co., Inc., 900 F.2d 558, 564 (2d Cir.1990).  In fact, consumer surveys and testimony are the only direct evidence on this question.  See International Kennel Club v. Mighty Star, Inc., 846 F.2d 1079, 1085 (7th Cir.1988).  Appellant explains its survey in three steps.  First, appellant points to the percentage of participants, 36 and 31 percent respectively, who identified The Boston Beer Company and Boston Beer Works as the producer of Samuel Adams beer.  Next, appellant contends that this correlation proves that the public associates Samuel Adams beer with the words \"Boston Beer.\"   Finally, appellant concludes that secondary meaning has been established because whenever a consumer sees or hears the term \"Boston Beer,\" it will associate the product with the brewer of Samuel Adams beer.  The district court found that the survey did not bridge the logical gap between steps two and three.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our examination of the survey and its results convinces us that, while the survey might provide some evidence of secondary meaning, the district court's treatment of the survey was not clearly erroneous.  The court's finding, that the survey results demonstrate a product-place association as opposed to a product-source association, is not inconsistent with the survey results, and provides a viable alternative to the explanation proffered by appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just because one-third of those surveyed, when presented with a list of beers and a brewer whose name contained the words \"Boston Beer,\" matched that brewer with Samuel Adams beer, does not mean that the words \"Boston Beer,\" used in connection with appellant's name, have necessarily assumed a secondary meaning.  It is just as probable, as the district court lucidly explained, that appellant's marks are still primarily perceived by consumers as geographically descriptive terms, and that consumers are simply aware of the fact that Samuel Adams is a Boston beer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Moreover, the district court observed that the survey was somewhat suggestive in that it gave the impression that Boston Beer Works was a \"company,\" like Anheuser-Busch and Latrobe, as opposed to a restaurant/brew pub.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, if the survey unequivocally establishes secondary meaning in the marks \"Boston Beer\" and \"Boston,\" then we are at a loss to understand why, when 36% of those surveyed thought that Samuel Adams beer was brewed by The Boston Beer Company, only 4% of the same group thought that Boston Ale was also produced by that company.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  If the marks have acquired secondary meaning, the same people who selected Samuel Adams as one of appellant's brews should have selected Boston Ale as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court's ultimate finding on secondary meaning was based upon its consideration of circumstantial as well as direct evidence, we briefly discuss the former.  We have already set forth the relevant factors for considering circumstantial evidence of secondary meaning, as well as the district court's thorough analysis of the evidence thereunder.  The district court's finding that the circumstantial evidence of secondary meaning did not support an inference favorable to appellant is well-supported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the entire record, placing particular emphasis on appellant's survey, we can find no error, clear or otherwise, in the district court's finding that appellant failed to carry its burden of proving secondary meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next appellant argues that the trial court committed legal error by \"rejecting\" the survey for \"failure to show any consumer identification of 'company'.\"   According to appellant this was a mistake because the Lanham Act does not require that the consumer actually know the producer's name.  As a preliminary matter, appellant is incorrect when it states that the district court \"rejected\" the survey.  The district court accepted the survey into evidence and gave it careful consideration before concluding that the survey did not provide a basis for a finding of secondary meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, appellant incorrectly attributes a legal error to the court.  At the risk of repeating ourselves, the district court found that appellant had not met its burden of proving that its marks had come to identify a single source of beer as opposed to simply identifying a geographic origin.  This finding does not rest upon an erroneous view of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant tries to execute an end-run around the district court's finding on secondary meaning.  Appellant maintains that because the survey demonstrates a likelihood of consumer confusion between The Boston Beer Company and its products and Boston Beer Works and its products, secondary meaning must exist.  While it is true that a finding of a likelihood of confusion could only occur in this case if secondary meaning had attached to appellant's marks, appellant's argument places the cart before the Clydesdale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that appellant's marks were not entitled to trademark protection because they had not attained secondary meaning.  Accordingly, that court did not need to address the question of likelihood of confusion.  The determination as to whether a likelihood of confusion exists is a question of fact.  See Aktiebolaget Electrolux v. Armatron International, Inc., 999 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1993) (citing Keds Corp. v. Renee International Trading Corp., 888 F.2d 215, 222 (1st Cir.1989)).  This determination is generally based upon eight separate factors, each of which requires its own factual findings.  See id.  (setting out the eight factors).  Because we affirm the district court's finding on secondary meaning, we need not address the issue of likelihood of confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This is not, however, the extent of appellant's brews.  In fact, appellant sports an entire line of \"Samuel Adams\" beers, including:  \"Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic,\" \"Samuel Adams Cream Stout,\" \"Samuel Adams Double Bock,\" \"Samuel Adams Triple Bock,\" \"Samuel Adams Oktoberfest,\" \"Samuel Adams Wheat Brew,\" \"Samuel Adams Winter Ale\" and \"Samuel Adams Winter Lager.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> For purposes of this opinion, the term trademark includes trade names as well.

Appellant contended that appellee's name was confusingly similar to its own, and would mislead the public into thinking that Boston Beer Works' products or services originated or were associated with those of The Boston Beer Company.  The district court rejected this claim, concluding that appellant's marks \"Boston Beer,\" as used in its name, and \"Boston,\" as used in connection with a number of its products, were not entitled to trademark protection.  We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <p>BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant is a beer manufacturer.  In 1985 appellant began brewing Samuel Adams Boston Lager at a brewery in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania under the name \"Boston Beer Company.\"   The Pittsburgh facility was independently owned, and appellant operated it as a contract brewer, namely, one who engages another to manufacture beer in a brewery owned by the other.  Presently, appellant has contract breweries in Pittsburgh, Utica, New York, and Portland, Oregon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In November 1988 appellant first began to brew its own beer at a brewery located in Boston.  This also marked the first time that appellant actually brewed any beer in the city that shares its name.  Appellant has, however, always called Boston its corporate home, and virtually all of its assets and non-sales employees can be found in Massachusetts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant's \"Boston\" brews are not limited to Samuel Adams Boston Lager.  In fact, appellant has what it refers to as a \"family\" of \"Boston\" beers.  In addition to Samuel Adams Boston Lager, other members of this family are Boston Lightship, which appellant began marketing in September 1987, and Samuel Adams Boston Ale, which appellant began marketing in October 1988.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a>  Appellant's beers are marketed and distributed throughout the United States and abroad.  Appellant sells its beers to restaurants, bars, package stores and grocery stores for resale;  it does not make any sales directly to the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the past five years appellant has spent substantial amounts of money promoting its products in the Boston area.  From 1988 through 1992, appellant spent approximately $350,000 in advertising on major Boston radio stations.  Among the various other promotional means used by appellant are billboards, print advertising, and sales of promotional materials such as coasters, balloons, hats, table tents and table tent holders.  By 1992 appellant's total sales in the Boston area had exceeded $3 million and its total sales had exceeded $20 million.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellee is a restaurant and brew pub.  On April 10, 1992, it opened for business on Brookline Avenue in the Kenmore Square section of Boston, directly across the street from Fenway Park, home of the Boston Red Sox.  As a brew pub, appellee is a licensed restaurant that brews beer on-site for consumption by its patrons.  One of the beers brewed by appellee is named \"Boston Red.\"   In addition to brewing and serving its own beers, appellee offers a wide range of food.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant commenced this action on April 14, 1992 alleging trademark and trade name infringement, misappropriation and unfair competition pursuant to Sec. 43(a) of the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. Sec. 1125(a), the general laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts and common law.  The first amended complaint alleged, inter alia, that appellee's \"adoption of 'BOSTON BEER WORKS' made with knowledge of Plaintiff's prior use of the trademark and trade name 'BOSTON BEER COMPANY' and its 'BOSTON BRAND' family of trademarks....\" constitutes a violation of Sec. 43(a) of the Lanham Act.  First Amended Complaint at p 17.  On April 15 appellant moved for a temporary restraining order to stop appellee from using the names \"Boston Beer Works\" and \"Boston Red.\"   The motion was denied the same day.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 21 appellant moved for a preliminary injunction.  After two days of hearings and argument the district court denied the motion.  In a Memorandum and Order dated June 18, 1992 (the \"June Memorandum\"), the district court found that the appellant's marks were not entitled to trademark<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> protection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found first that \"plaintiff's 'BOSTON BEER' mark as used in its name 'BOSTON BEER COMPANY' is sufficiently descriptive so as not to be considered generic and thus unprotectable.\"   June Memorandum at 9.  Next, the court found that \"plaintiff's 'BOSTON' mark as used in its 'SAMUEL ADAMS BOSTON' beers and its 'BOSTON LIGHTSHIP' beer is a descriptive term.\"   In fact, the court found that appellant did not even contend that its marks were anything but descriptive.  Id.  Therefore, the court stated, in order to satisfy its burden of establishing that its marks are entitled to trademark protection, \"[p]laintiff must still make a showing, under a likelihood standard, that its name and marks have acquired secondary meaning.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the relevant preliminary injunction considerations, the court concluded that appellant had \"not shown a likelihood of establishing by a preponderance of the evidence a secondary meaning for 'BOSTON BEER' and 'BOSTON.' \"   Id. at 15.  Specifically, the court found that although appellant had been using the name \"Boston Beer Company\" and the term \"Boston\" in connection with Samuel Adams Boston Lager since late 1985, not all of appellant's promotional materials contained \"The Boston Beer Company\" name, and those that did, always used it along with another of appellant's beer marks.  \"For example,\" the court pointed out, \"on the cards plaintiff prints to be inserted into table tents for restaurants and bars, the 'BOSTON BEER COMPANY' name appears on the bottom of the card with plaintiff's 'SAMUEL ADAMS' logo and its slogan 'The Best Beer in America' appearing at the top of the card.\"   June Memorandum at 11.  Moreover, the court found that all of the promotions that did include the company's name, \"place[d] the name on the bottom and in smaller type than the rest of the words on the promotional item.\"   Id.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As far as the labels appearing on each of appellant's three \"Boston\" beers, the court noted that \"Boston\" did in fact appear in each of the beers' names.  In addition, the court found that each beer's bottle label contained an illustration or logo, and that, on bottles of Samuel Adams Boston Lager and Boston Lightship, the words \"Samuel Adams\" and \"Lightship\" were in larger print than the words \"Boston Lager\" and \"Boston,\" respectively.  Finally, the court found that the name \"Boston Beer Company\" appeared at the bottom of all appellant's labels in a smaller type than either the illustration or the other words on the label.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It was undisputed that appellant engaged in substantial advertising and promotion of its products in the Boston area.  The court found, however, that appellant's efforts were \"focused in the direction of promoting a connection between 'SAMUEL ADAMS' and plaintiff's products[,]\" and not towards establishing a connection between the terms \"Boston Beer\" and \"Boston\" and its beer products.  Id. at 15-16.  In reaching this result, the court examined appellant's billboards, radio advertisements, various promotional paraphernalia, and a promotional brochure.  Finally, the court pointed out that the vast majority of appellant's advertising is directed towards its best-selling brand, Samuel Adams Boston Lager, and that appellant produces other \"Samuel Adams\" beers that are not part of its \"Boston\" family.  As the court also observed,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p>[t]he fact that plaintiff produces other Samuel Adams beers, with the same Samuel Adams logo as appears on its \"Samuel Adams Boston Lager\" and \"Samuel Adams Boston Ale\" beer labels, but without the \"BOSTON\" family name, reduces the likelihood that a consumer will associate \"BOSTON\" or \"BOSTON BEER\" with plaintiff's products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">June Memorandum at 14-15.  In summary, the court found that, notwithstanding the duration of appellant's use of the \"Boston Beer Company\" name and the term \"Boston\" in connection with three of its products, it had not directed its advertising and promotional activities to creating a connection between \"Boston Beer\" and its products, and had not made efforts at promoting a connection between \"Boston\" and its products, and therefore it had not shown a likelihood of establishing secondary meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 9 and 10, 1993 a non-jury trial was held, at the conclusion of which the court gave its decision from the bench.  The sole issues litigated were:  (1) whether secondary meaning had attached to \"Boston\" and \"Boston Beer,\" and (2) if so, whether a likelihood of consumer confusion existed.  Appellant's principal evidence at trial consisted of a consumer survey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The survey was conducted among 400 \"beer drinkers\" from the greater-Boston area who were split into two groups of 200.  Each group was provided with a choice of approximately 20 beers and asked to identify the beer or beers produced by each of three different \"beer companies.\"   Both groups were asked about the \"Latrobe Brewing Company\" and the \"Anheuser-Busch company.\"   One group was asked about Boston Beer Company and the other about Boston Beer Works.  Included on the list were appellant's three \"Boston\" beers which appeared as \"Samuel Adams beer,\" \"Boston Ale,\" and \"Lightship.\"   The other beers consisted of various domestic and imported brands.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked what brand of beer was produced by Boston Beer Company, 36% responded with Samuel Adams beer.  Boston Ale and Lightship each garnered 4%, and 59% responded that they did not know.  Similarly, for the group asked about Boston Beer Works, 31% responded with Samuel Adams, 4% with Boston Ale, 2% Lightship and 66% could not identify any brand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After hearing all of the evidence, the court found:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p>The principal difference between the evidence that was before me at the time of the preliminary injunction hearing and the evidence that is before me in the full development of the case here on trial is the addition of the survey evidence that the plaintiff has offered.  I find that that is not sufficient to establish a secondary meaning and indeed as fact finder I find that it does not even strongly support an inference of secondary meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court went on to identify what it felt were two problems with the survey.  First it had trouble drawing inferences favorable to appellant from the survey because participants were told that they were going to be asked questions about beer \"companies\" as opposed to a neutral term such as \"producers\" or \"brewers.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second and more importantly, the district court found that the survey results simply did not provide strong support for an inference of secondary meaning.  In a lengthy colloquy with appellant's trial counsel the district court explained that \"[a] strong inference I draw from this is that when the interviewee is prompted by three words, two of which are 'Boston Beer,' a third of them come back with 'Samuel Adams'.\"  \"Is that enough\" the court queried, \"if [the interviewees are] just associating Samuel Adams with somebody who produces beer in Boston....\"  In other words, the court found that the survey provided a strong inference of an association between product and place, but not between product and source.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a>  This association, the court believed, explained the fact that similar percentages associated Samuel Adams with Boston Beer Company and Boston Beer Works.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">According to the court, the results</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p>support[ed] an inference of uncertainty, if not confusion, as between Boston Beer Works and Boston Beer Company, but that is not the issue that is decisive of the adequacy of the evidence before me to show secondary meaning.  So taking into account that evidence along with all the other evidence before me, I find by a preponderance of the evidence that there has not been an establishment of a secondary meaning that associates the product with Boston Beer Company.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the trial court found that appellant had failed to meet its burden on secondary meaning, the court did not reach the issue of likelihood of confusion.  This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p>DISCUSSION</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant argues that the district court committed legal error by failing to make an independent finding that the marks lack \"inherent distinctiveness,\" to go along with its finding that the marks \"Boston\" and \"Boston Beer\" were descriptive.  Alternatively, appellant contends that, even if the court did not commit any legal error on this front, its finding that the marks are descriptive was clearly erroneous.  Next, appellant argues that the district court's finding that the survey was not highly probative of secondary meaning was clearly erroneous.  Alternatively, appellant contends that the district court misunderstood the doctrine of secondary meaning.  Finally, appellant argues that the survey, standing alone or together with the other evidence, established a likelihood of confusion as a matter of law, and therefore the court's finding that its marks lacked secondary meaning was illogical.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Neither mark over which appellant asserts exclusive rights--\"Boston Beer\" and \"Boston\"--are registered.  Therefore the present claim is based upon Sec. 43(a) of the Lanham Act which covers unregistered trademarks.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a>  Section 43(a) prohibits any person from using</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p>in connection with any goods ... or any container for goods, ... any word, term, name, symbol, or device, or any combination thereof ... which ... is likely to cause confusion, or to cause mistake, or to deceive ... as to the origin, sponsorship, or approval of his or her goods ... by another person.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">15 U.S.C. Sec. 1125(a).  It is settled that Sec. 43(a) of the Lanham Act protects qualifying unregistered marks, and that the general principles qualifying a mark for registration under Sec. 2 of the Lanham Act are generally applicable in determining whether an unregistered mark is entitled to protection under Sec. 43(a).

Two Pesos, at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2757;  Miller Brewing Co. v.

In the middle there are so-called descriptive terms, such as a geographical term, which can be protected, but only if it has acquired \"secondary meaning\" by which consumers associate it with a particular producer or source.

At the other end of the spectrum, there are suggestive, arbitrary and fanciful terms that can be protected without proof of secondary meaning.  These terms are considered \"inherently distinctive.\"  Two Pesos, --- U.S. at ----, 112 S.Ct. at 2757;  see Wiley v.

Accordingly, the district court's findings on both of these questions are subject to review only for clear error.  Atlantic Track &amp; Turnout Co. v.

From the very outset of this litigation appellant had pitched its case on the theory that its marks are descriptive, that they have attained secondary meaning, and are thus entitled to trademark protection.  The trial below proceeded on the common understanding that the marks were descriptive;  and appellant acknowledged that secondary meaning and likelihood of confusion were the only triable issues.  Moreover, after rendering its bench decision, the trial court asked appellant if any additional findings were necessary in order to address all of its claims, and appellant did not request a finding on inherent distinctiveness.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to appellant, it preserved this issue by underlining, and thereby objecting to, appellee's proposed pretrial finding that the marks were \"neither arbitrary nor fanciful.\"   Appendix at 444.

Callmann, Unfair Competition, Trademarks and Monopolies, Sec. 19.26 at 144 (4th ed. 1989);  see Burke-Parsons-Bowlby Corp., 871 F.2d at 595 (geographically descriptive term lacks secondary meaning if it still primarily denotes a geographic area as opposed to a single source).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Among the factors this court generally looks to in determining whether a term has acquired secondary meaning are:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p>(1) the length and manner of its use, (2) the nature and extent of advertising and promotion of the mark and (3) the efforts made in the direction of promoting a conscious connection, in the public's mind, between the name or mark and a particular product or venture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Wheeler, 814 F.2d at 816 (quoting Volkswagenwerk AG v. Rickard, 492 F.2d at 478).   Proof relating to these factors constitutes circumstantial evidence from which a court must draw reasonable inferences.  In its bench decision, the district court found, and appellant does not dispute, that, except for the survey, the evidence of secondary meaning was not materially different at trial than it was at the preliminary injunction hearing.  The court then concluded that the addition of the survey to the circumstantial evidence did not alter its prior findings, and that appellant had not met its burden of establishing secondary meaning.  In its brief appellant does not explicitly address the court's earlier findings.  Instead, appellant alleges that the court's treatment of the survey is grounds for reversing its finding on secondary meaning.  We turn to the survey.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Survey evidence has become a well-recognized means of establishing secondary meaning.  See President and Trustees of Colby College, 508 F.2d at 809;  PaperCutter, Inc. v. Fay's Drug Co., Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"539813\"><a href=\"/opinion/539813/papercutter-inc-appellant-cross-appellee-v-fays-drug-co-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">900</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span>, 564 (2d Cir.1990).  In fact, consumer surveys and testimony are the only direct evidence on this question.  See International Kennel Club v. Mighty Star, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506099\"><a href=\"/opinion/506099/international-kennel-club-of-chicago-inc-an-illinois-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">846</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1079</span></a></span>, 1085 (7th Cir.1988).  Appellant explains its survey in three steps.  First, appellant points to the percentage of participants, 36 and 31 percent respectively, who identified The Boston Beer Company and Boston Beer Works as the producer of Samuel Adams beer.  Next, appellant contends that this correlation proves that the public associates Samuel Adams beer with the words \"Boston Beer.\"   Finally, appellant concludes that secondary meaning has been established because whenever a consumer sees or hears the term \"Boston Beer,\" it will associate the product with the brewer of Samuel Adams beer.  The district court found that the survey did not bridge the logical gap between steps two and three.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our examination of the survey and its results convinces us that, while the survey might provide some evidence of secondary meaning, the district court's treatment of the survey was not clearly erroneous.  The court's finding, that the survey results demonstrate a product-place association as opposed to a product-source association, is not inconsistent with the survey results, and provides a viable alternative to the explanation proffered by appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Just because one-third of those surveyed, when presented with a list of beers and a brewer whose name contained the words \"Boston Beer,\" matched that brewer with Samuel Adams beer, does not mean that the words \"Boston Beer,\" used in connection with appellant's name, have necessarily assumed a secondary meaning.  It is just as probable, as the district court lucidly explained, that appellant's marks are still primarily perceived by consumers as geographically descriptive terms, and that consumers are simply aware of the fact that Samuel Adams is a Boston beer.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a>  Moreover, the district court observed that the survey was somewhat suggestive in that it gave the impression that Boston Beer Works was a \"company,\" like Anheuser-Busch and Latrobe, as opposed to a restaurant/brew pub.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, if the survey unequivocally establishes secondary meaning in the marks \"Boston Beer\" and \"Boston,\" then we are at a loss to understand why, when 36% of those surveyed thought that Samuel Adams beer was brewed by The Boston Beer Company, only 4% of the same group thought that Boston Ale was also produced by that company.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a>  If the marks have acquired secondary meaning, the same people who selected Samuel Adams as one of appellant's brews should have selected Boston Ale as well.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the district court's ultimate finding on secondary meaning was based upon its consideration of circumstantial as well as direct evidence, we briefly discuss the former.  We have already set forth the relevant factors for considering circumstantial evidence of secondary meaning, as well as the district court's thorough analysis of the evidence thereunder.  The district court's finding that the circumstantial evidence of secondary meaning did not support an inference favorable to appellant is well-supported.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the entire record, placing particular emphasis on appellant's survey, we can find no error, clear or otherwise, in the district court's finding that appellant failed to carry its burden of proving secondary meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Next appellant argues that the trial court committed legal error by \"rejecting\" the survey for \"failure to show any consumer identification of 'company'.\"   According to appellant this was a mistake because the Lanham Act does not require that the consumer actually know the producer's name.  As a preliminary matter, appellant is incorrect when it states that the district court \"rejected\" the survey.  The district court accepted the survey into evidence and gave it careful consideration before concluding that the survey did not provide a basis for a finding of secondary meaning.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, appellant incorrectly attributes a legal error to the court.  At the risk of repeating ourselves, the district court found that appellant had not met its burden of proving that its marks had come to identify a single source of beer as opposed to simply identifying a geographic origin.  This finding does not rest upon an erroneous view of the law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, appellant tries to execute an end-run around the district court's finding on secondary meaning.  Appellant maintains that because the survey demonstrates a likelihood of consumer confusion between The Boston Beer Company and its products and Boston Beer Works and its products, secondary meaning must exist.  While it is true that a finding of a likelihood of confusion could only occur in this case if secondary meaning had attached to appellant's marks, appellant's argument places the cart before the Clydesdale.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court found that appellant's marks were not entitled to trademark protection because they had not attained secondary meaning.  Accordingly, that court did not need to address the question of likelihood of confusion.  The determination as to whether a likelihood of confusion exists is a question of fact.  See Aktiebolaget Electrolux v. Armatron International, Inc., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"611604\"><a href=\"/opinion/611604/aktiebolaget-electrolux-v-armatron-international-inc-aktiebolaget/\"><span class=\"volume\">999</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 3 (1st Cir.1993) (citing Keds Corp. v. Renee International Trading Corp., <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531209\"><a href=\"/opinion/531209/the-keds-corp-v-renee-international-trading-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">888</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">215</span></a></span>, 222 (1st Cir.1989)).  This determination is generally based upon eight separate factors, each of which requires its own factual findings.  See id.  (setting out the eight factors).  Because we affirm the district court's finding on secondary meaning, we need not address the issue of likelihood of confusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Affirmed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> This is not, however, the extent of appellant's brews.  In fact, appellant sports an entire line of \"Samuel Adams\" beers, including:  \"Samuel Adams Cranberry Lambic,\" \"Samuel Adams Cream Stout,\" \"Samuel Adams Double Bock,\" \"Samuel Adams Triple Bock,\" \"Samuel Adams Oktoberfest,\" \"Samuel Adams Wheat Brew,\" \"Samuel Adams Winter Ale\" and \"Samuel Adams Winter Lager.\"</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> For purposes of this opinion, the term trademark includes trade names as well.
