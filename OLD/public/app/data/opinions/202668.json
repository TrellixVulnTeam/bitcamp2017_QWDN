On September 7, 2004, a jury\n\nfound co-defendants-appellants Alfre Luis Bravo (\"Bravo\"), Jesús\n\nAntonio Martínez-Rosado (\"Martínez\"), Luis Antonio Mancilla-Patino\n\n(\"Mancilla\") and José Said Isaa-Morales (\"Isaa\") (collectively\n\n\"Appellants\") guilty of two offenses: (1) possession with intent to\n\ndistribute more than one thousand kilograms of marijuana on board\n\na vessel and aiding and abetting, in violation of 46 U.S.C. app.\n\n§ 1903(a) (repealed 2006), and 18 U.S.C. § 2, and (2) conspiracy to\n\npossess with intent to distribute more than one thousand kilograms\n\nof marijuana on board a vessel, in violation of 46 U.S.C. app.\n\n§ 1903(j).     Thereafter, the Appellants were sentenced to a term of\n\nimprisonment of 120 months followed by five years supervised\n\nrelease   as   to   each   count,   to   be   served   concurrently.1   The\n\nAppellants now appeal their convictions and sentences.\n\n                               I. Background\n\n             On April 18, 2004, at approximately 4:45 A.M., the United\n\nStates Coast Guard (\"USCG\") cutter DEPENDABLE found the M/V EL\n\nCONQUISTADOR (the \"vessel\") riding low and \"dead in the water\" in\n\ninternational waters 180 nautical miles south of Santo Domingo,\n\nDominican Republic.        A Rigid Hulled Inflatable Boat, the ABLE 2,\n\nwas launched from the DEPENDABLE to approach the vessel.\n\n             The ABLE 2 observed that the vessel's name was written on\n\nits stern, but the vessel did not have a visible registration\n\n\n1\n    A special monetary assessment of $200 was also imposed.\n\n                                     -3-\n\fnumber, port identification, or country flag. On board the ABLE 2,\n\nOfficer Brian Hennessey (\"Hennessey\"), a technician and federal law\n\nenforcement officer with the USCG, requested that the vessel\n\nindicate its nationality.    The vessel master answered that the\n\nvessel was registered in Colombia.    He further claimed that the\n\nvessel had been fishing for approximately seven to eight days, but\n\nthat the vessel's engines were broken, and that they had no fish on\n\nboard and were en route to Haiti.2    Hennessey testified that he\n\nperceived a strong smell of marijuana coming from the vessel.\n\nHennessey relayed via radio the information from the vessel master\n\nto the DEPENDABLE and waited for permission to board the vessel.\n\n          At 7:39 A.M., Sean Connett (\"Connett\"), an employee with\n\nthe USCG at the District Command Center in Miami, contacted the\n\nColombian authorities to confirm the registry of the vessel via a\n\nwritten form entitled \"Action Request.\"   The Colombian authorities\n\nshortly responded with a \"Response to the Action\" form, indicating\n\nthat they could neither confirm nor refute that the EL CONQUISTADOR\n\nwas a Colombian vessel.   The Colombian authorities also suggested\n\nthat the USCG proceed under \"international law\" and requested that\n\nthe USCG inform them of the results of the inspection.\n\n          Acting on the premise that the vessel was \"stateless\" or\n\n\"without nationality,\" the USCG sought to place the vessel within\n\n\n\n2\n   The record indicates that the vessel did not contain any fish,\nusable fishing nets, line gear or refrigeration.\n\n                                -4-\n\fU.S. jurisdiction. The Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (\"MDLEA\")\n\nallows the United States to conduct drug law enforcement outside of\n\nthe United States, and more specifically, exercise jurisdiction\n\nover stateless vessels. 46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(c).           In accordance\n\nwith the MDLEA, Connett requested and received a \"Statement of No\n\nObjection\" from the USCG headquarters in Washington, D.C., granting\n\npermission   to   board   EL    CONQUISTADOR.     Connett   forwarded    the\n\nStatement to the USCG office in San Juan, which then forwarded it\n\nto the DEPENDABLE.\n\n          Upon    boarding     the   vessel,    Hennessey   observed    what\n\nappeared to be bales of marijuana, two of which were outside the\n\nfish hold, forty-six of which were inside the fish hold.3          He then\n\nconducted a field test confirming that the bales were, in fact,\n\nmarijuana.   In order to access the bales, USCG officers broke the\n\nfish hold, and transferred the bales onto the DEPENDABLE.4               The\n\nvessel's five crew members -- the four Appellants and the captain,\n\nJoaquín Emilio Cardona-Sandoval (\"Cardona-Sandoval\") -- were also\n\nbrought on board the DEPENDABLE.           The Colombian authorities were\n\nnotified of the USCG's findings, and upon arrival in San Juan, the\n\n\n\n\n3\n   The Drug Enforcement Administration (\"DEA\") later determined\nthat the bales constituted approximately 5,000 pounds of marijuana\nwith a street value of $7.5 million.\n4\n   USCG Officers then destroyed the vessel, as it had been taking\non water and towing would have been difficult and time consuming.\n\n                                     -5-\n\fAppellants    were   transferred   to       U.S.   Immigration      and   Customs\n\nEnforcement (\"ICE\") and detained.\n\n            At their joint trial, Appellants testified that they were\n\nfisherman in their home country of Colombia and that in 2004 they\n\nwere recruited in Colombia to participate in a fishing expedition\n\nby   two   individuals   known   to    them    as    \"Paco\"   and    \"Roberto.\"\n\nAppellants testified that they were unacquainted with each other\n\nwhen they arrived at the vessel.        They further testified that when\n\nthey arrived, Paco and Roberto, along with others, were armed with\n\nweapons, and marijuana was on the vessel. According to Appellants,\n\nPaco threatened that Appellants' families would be killed if they\n\ndid not take the marijuana to Haiti.               Appellants testified that\n\nthey feared for their families.             After a few days at sea, the\n\nvessel broke down.\n\n            On September 7, 2004, a jury found all four Appellants\n\nguilty of both counts of the indictment.             A pre-sentencing report\n\n(\"PSR\") was then filed on November 18, 2004, recommending that\n\nAppellants be granted a two-point reduction in their base offense\n\nlevel of 32 due to their minor roles in the offense.             Martínez and\n\nBravo were sentenced individually, and Isaa and Mancilla were\n\nsentenced jointly. At Appellants' various sentencing hearings, the\n\ngovernment opposed the minor role reduction.            The court denied the\n\nminor role adjustments, indicating that the evidence was such that\n\n\n\n\n                                      -6-\n\fit could not state who was a major and who was a minor participant\n\nin the case.\n\n          At his sentencing hearing, Appellant Martínez raised no\n\nobjections   to    the    PSR,   and   accordingly,      was    not    granted     any\n\nadjustments, and was sentenced to 120 months imprisonment.                    In the\n\nother sentencing hearings, Appellants Bravo, Isaa and Mancilla\n\nobjected to the PSR and requested a safety-valve benefit, as well\n\nas a downward departure for duress.             Appellants participated in a\n\ngovernment debriefing in order to qualify for the safety-valve\n\nbenefit, but they each received a sealed motion from the government\n\nstating that the safety-valve would not be recommended because the\n\ngovernment   did    not    believe     that    Appellants      had    provided     all\n\navailable information in a truthful manner.5\n\n          Isaa's     and     Mancilla's       joint   hearing         was   held    on\n\nDecember 8, 2004.        The court granted them an immediate hearing to\n\ndetermine their entitlement to the safety-valve benefit.                      A DEA\n\nspecial   agent     testified     that,       although   Appellants'         stories\n\ncoincided in certain aspects, it was abnormal that Appellants did\n\nnot know the details of how the drug transfer was going to take\n\nplace.    He explained that the scenario was \"too risky\" to be\n\nbelievable; he had never investigated a case in which a drug\n\n\n\n5\n   See 18 U.S.C. § 3553(f)(5) (requiring that \"the defendant has\ntruthfully provided to the Government all information and evidence\nthe defendant has concerning the offense\"); U.S.S.G. § 5C1.2(a)(5)\n(same).\n\n                                        -7-\n\ftrafficker had placed unknown individuals against their wills on a\n\nvessel loaded with contraband of such value without providing\n\ninformation about the transfer, or without agreeing to any payment.\n\nThe agent also noticed that, based on his experience and training,\n\nAppellants appeared to easily answer \"non-stressful\" questions\n\nabout their families and Colombia, but that a level of stress or\n\ndeception was perceptible in Appellants' answers to questions\n\nregarding the smuggling venture, the drugs, and payments.\n\n          The court denied Isaa and Mancilla the safety-valve\n\nbenefit, indicating that the consistency of Appellants' statements\n\ndid not overcome the gaps in the logic of their story.   The court\n\nalso denied their requests for a downward departure for duress.\n\nAgain, the court indicated that it did not find Appellants' stories\n\nto be totally truthful. Both Appellants were then sentenced to the\n\nstatutory mandatory minimum term of 120 months of imprisonment.\n\n          Bravo was sentenced a week later, on December 15, 2004.\n\nThe district court denied Bravo's request for a safety-valve\n\nhearing, and subsequently denied him the safety-valve benefit.\n\nNeither denial was explained by the court.   The court also denied\n\nBravo's request for a downward departure for duress, and sentenced\n\nhim to the statutory mandatory minimum term of 120 months of\n\nimprisonment.\n\n          Appellants now appeal a variety of issues regarding their\n\nconvictions and sentences.\n\n\n                               -8-\n\f                         II. Issues on Appeal\n\nA.    The United States' Jurisdiction over the Vessel\n\n            Appellants are neither citizens nor resident aliens of\n\nthe United States and the vessel involved was not a vessel of the\n\nUnited States.      Thus, for Appellants to be prosecuted under the\n\nMDLEA, the vessel must be \"subject to the jurisdiction of the\n\nUnited States.\" 46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(a).         Whether the district\n\ncourt erred in determining that it had jurisdiction over the\n\nvessel, and therefore over Appellants, is a question of law subject\n\nto de novo review.     See id. § 1903(f) (\"All jurisdictional issues\n\narising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law . . .\n\n.\"); see also United States v. Gonzáles, 311 F.3d 440, 443 (1st\n\nCir. 2002)(\"The term 'jurisdiction' . . . evidently refers to the\n\nsubstantive reach of the statute--applying to some vessels but not\n\nothers--and not to subject matter jurisdiction of the court.\").\n\n            Under the MDLEA, \"a 'vessel subject to the jurisdiction\n\nof the United States' includes . . . a vessel without nationality.\"\n\n46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(c)(1)(A).      Additionally, \"a 'vessel without\n\nnationality' includes . . . a vessel aboard which the master or\n\nperson in charge makes a claim of registry and the claimed nation\n\nof registry does not affirmatively and unequivocally assert that\n\nthe vessel is of its nationality.\"       Id. § 1903(c)(2)(C).   Here, the\n\nvessel master claimed registry in Colombia, and after contacting\n\nthe   appropriate    Colombian   authorities,    the   USCG   received   a\n\n\n                                   -9-\n\f\"Response to the Action\" form from Colombia neither confirming nor\n\nrefuting the vessel's registration in Colombia. Since Colombia, as\n\nthe nation of alleged registry, could not confirm the vessel's\n\nregistration,         the    vessel        qualifies      as      a     \"vessel     without\n\nnationality\" under the MDLEA, and is within the jurisdiction of the\n\nfederal courts of the United States.\n\n              Under    the    plain    language      of     the       MDLEA,    Appellants'\n\nargument that jurisdiction includes a nexus requirement -- i.e., a\n\nrequirement that the government show that the marijuana transported\n\nin   the    vessel    would     affect      the    United      States,         fails.   The\n\nAppellants' reliance on United States v. Hayes, 653 F.2d 8 (1st\n\nCir. 1981) (finding a jurisdictional nexus requirement for the\n\napplication of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act of\n\n1970,   §    1013,    21     U.S.C.    §    963,   to   a   vessel       apprehended     in\n\ninternational waters) and United States v. Cafiero, 242 F. Supp. 2d\n\n49 (D. Mass. 2003) (finding a jurisdictional nexus requirement for\n\nthe application of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act of\n\n1970, §§ 401, 404, 21 U.S.C. §§ 841, 844, to an Italian citizen\n\naboard a flight that made an unplanned diversion into United States\n\nterritory), is misplaced.             Those cases find a jurisdictional nexus\n\nrequirement in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act of\n\n1970.      We do not read the MDLEA to require a jurisdictional nexus.\n\nSee, e.g., United States v. Cardales, 168 F.3d 548, 553 (1st Cir.\n\n1999) (\"[D]ue process does not require the government to prove a\n\n\n                                            -10-\n\fnexus between a defendant's criminal conduct and the United States\n\nin a prosecution under the MDLEA . . . .\"); United States v.\n\nRendon, 354 F.3d 1320, 1325 (11th Cir. 2003)(\"[T]his circuit . . .\n\nha[s] not embellished the MDLEA with a nexus requirement.\"); United\n\nStates v. Moreno-Morillo, 334 F.3d 819 (9th Cir. 2003) (holding\n\nthat Congress did not act under its Commerce Clause authority in\n\nenacting the MDLEA and, thus, \"no nexus between the activities\n\nproscribed by the MDLEA and interstate or foreign commerce\" is\n\nrequired); United States v. Suerte, 291 F.3d 366, 375 (5th Cir.\n\n2002) (\"[T]o the extent the Due Process Clause may constrain the\n\nMDLEA's extraterritorial reach, that clause does not impose a nexus\n\nrequirement.\"); United States v. Martínez-Hidalgo, 993 F.2d 1052,\n\n1056 (3d Cir. 1993) (finding no nexus requirement in the MDLEA to\n\nsearch stateless vessel in international waters).\n\n            Equally misplaced is Appellants' contention that the\n\nUnited States disregarded the recommendation of the Colombian\n\nauthorities to follow \"international law\" when apprehending the\n\nvessel.    The USCG acted within both international treaty law and\n\ncustomary international law.        The Agreement to Suppress Illicit\n\nTraffic by Sea, ratified and brought into force by the United\n\nStates    and   Colombia   in   1997,   is   the   treaty   governing   the\n\napprehension of the vessel and its crew. See Agreement Between the\n\nGovernment of the United States of America and the Government of\n\nthe Republic of Colombia to Suppress Illicit Traffic by Sea,\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\fFeb. 20, 1997, T.I.A.S. No. 12835.                The treaty authorizes the\n\ncountry requesting verification of a registry to \"proceed in\n\naccordance with international law\" in the event that neither party\n\ncan confirm or refute a flag claim of a vessel in international\n\nwaters,    id.     art.   8,   and   the    MDLEA    is    in    compliance    with\n\ninternational law.        The extra-territorial jurisdiction authorized\n\nin the MDLEA is consistent with the \"protective principle\" of\n\ninternational law,        see Cardales, 168 F.3d at 553 (explaining that\n\nthe protective principle permits a nation \"'to assert jurisdiction\n\nover   a   person    whose     conduct     outside   the     nation's    territory\n\nthreatens    the    nation's    security'\")       (quoting      United   States    v.\n\nRobinson, 843 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir. 1988)), and is supported by\n\nnumerous    international      treaties     and   agreements,      including      the\n\nSingle Convention on Narcotic Drugs, Mar. 30 1961, 18 U.S.T. 1407,\n\nand its 1972 Protocol, Amendment of the Single Convention on\n\nNarcotic Drugs, Mar. 25, 1972, 26 U.S.T. 1439; the Convention on\n\nNarcotic Drugs:      Psychotropic Substances, Feb. 21, 1971, 32 U.S.T.\n\n543; the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Dec. 10,\n\n1982, S. Treaty Doc. No. 103-39, 1833 U.N.T.S. 3; and the United\n\nNations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and\n\nPsychotropic Substances, Dec. 20, 1988, 28 I.L.M. 493.6\n\n\n\n\n6\n   We render no opinion as to whether or to what extent these\nagreements or any analogous agreements are binding on the United\nStates.\n\n                                      -12-\n\f             Our conclusion is without doubt or reservation: the\n\nUnited States had jurisdiction over the vessel, and was correct to\n\napply the MDLEA to Appellants.\n\nB.   Lack of Pre-trial Determination of Jurisdiction\n\n             The Appellants assert that the district court erroneously\n\nallowed the jury to hear testimony regarding jurisdiction.                We\n\nagree.    \"All jurisdictional issues arising under [the MDLEA] are\n\npreliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial\n\njudge.\"   46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(f).       The exposure of the jury to the\n\njurisdictional      testimony     nonetheless      was     harmless.    Non-\n\nconstitutional evidentiary error is harmless \"so long as it is\n\nhighly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\"\n\nUnited States v. Flemmi, 402 F.3d 79, 95 (1st Cir. 2005) (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted).       Here, that standard is met because the\n\njury   was   presented   with   ample   evidence    that    the   Appellants\n\npossessed marijuana, and that they did so with the intent to\n\ndistribute it.     Moreover, the jury was instructed on the issues\n\nthat it had to determine, and instructed that jurisdiction over the\n\nvessel was not an issue in the case, making it even more unlikely\n\nthat the error affected the jury's verdict. See id. (finding that\n\na non-constitutional evidentiary error was harmless because the\n\njury was presented with ample evidence of the defendant's guilt,\n\nand the judge correctly instructed the jury).\n\n\n\n\n                                   -13-\n\fC.   Motion to Suppress\n\n           Appellants challenge the denial of their pre-trial motion\n\nto suppress the bales of marijuana seized from the vessel on the\n\ngrounds that the USCG lacked reasonable suspicion to stop and\n\nsearch the vessel, in violation of the Fourth Amendment.          We apply\n\na mixed standard of review to the district court's denial of the\n\nsuppression motion, reviewing the court's findings of fact for\n\nclear error and the application of the law to those facts de novo.\n\nTinoco, 304 F.3d at 1116.\n\n           The Fourth Amendment prohibits \"unreasonable searches and\n\nseizures\" whether or not the evidence is sought to be used in a\n\ncriminal   trial,   and   a   violation   of   the   Amendment   is   \"fully\n\naccomplished\" at the time of an unreasonable government intrusion.\n\nUnited States v. Calandra, 414 U.S. 338, 354 (1974); see also\n\nUnited States v. Leon, 468 U.S. 897, 906 (1984).          For purposes of\n\nthis case, therefore, if there was a constitutional violation of\n\nthe Fourth Amendment, it occurred solely in international waters,\n\nwhere the search and seizure took place.        But the Fourth Amendment\n\ndoes not apply to activities of the United States against aliens in\n\ninternational waters.     See United States v.       Verdugo-Urquidez, 494\n\nU.S. 259, 267 (1990).         The Supreme Court's holding in Verdugo-\n\nUrquidez is clear that the actions of the United States directed\n\nagainst aliens in foreign territory or in international waters are\n\nnot constrained by the Fourth Amendment. 494 U.S. at 267 (\"There is\n\n\n                                   -14-\n\f. . . no indication that the Fourth Amendment was understood by\n\ncontemporaries of the Framers to apply to activities of the United\n\nStates    directed     against   aliens       in    foreign     territory     or    in\n\ninternational       waters.\");   see    also       United   States    v.    Vilches-\n\nNavarrete, 413 F. Supp. 2d 60, 69 (D. P.R. 2006) (\"In light of the\n\nSupreme Court's holding in Verdugo-Urquidez, it is pellucid that\n\nthe Fourth Amendment does not apply to the search of non-resident\n\naliens on a ship in international waters.\").                    Accordingly, the\n\ndistrict    court    was   correct     in   denying     Appellants'        motion    to\n\nsuppress because the Fourth Amendment was inapplicable to the\n\nUSCG's search of the vessel.\n\nD.   Sufficiency of the Evidence to Convict\n\n            Appellants moved for judgment of acquittal, pursuant to\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 29, after the conclusion of the Government's case\n\nin chief and again after the close of all the evidence.                             The\n\ndistrict court denied both motions.                Here, Appellants claim that\n\nthe evidence is insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt\n\nthat they had the required intent to violate the laws of the United\n\nStates.    Specifically,     Appellants       allege    that    the   evidence       is\n\ninsufficient to establish that they intended to distribute the\n\nmarijuana, as required by 46 U.S.C. app. § 1903(a), see United\n\nStates v. Guerrero, 114 F.3d 332, 339 (1st Cir. 1997), or that they\n\nsought by their actions to make the trafficking venture succeed, as\n\nrequired by 18 U.S.C. § 2, see id. at 341-42.                  \"We review Rule 29\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\fdeterminations de novo, resolving any evidentiary conflicts or\n\ncredibility issues in the government's favor.\" Id. at 339. \"If the\n\nevidence, viewed under this lens, permits a rational jury to find\n\n. . . the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt, then the\n\nevidence is legally sufficient.\"        Id. (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).\n\n            In circumstantial cases such as this one, the evidence is\n\nsufficient to convict if it adequately supports the \"the requisite\n\ntwo-step inference\": (1) that the vessel was engaged in obviously\n\nillegal activity, and (2) that each Appellant was ready to assist\n\nin the criminal enterprise.     United States v. Jiménez-Pérez, 869\n\nF.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir. 1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). The\n\ngovernment argues that the jury could have reasonably drawn this\n\ntwo-step inference from the evidence (i) that the Appellants\n\nadmitted to knowing that marijuana was on the vessel before or\n\nshortly after the vessel departed, (ii) that the Appellants did not\n\nseek to return to Colombia nor destroy the marijuana, and (iii)\n\nthat although the Appellants claimed that they thought they were\n\ngoing on a fishing expedition, the vessel lacked fish, usable\n\nfishing nets, line gear or refrigeration. See United States v.\n\nBatista-Polanco, 927 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir. 1991) (holding that the\n\nevidence \"may be entirely circumstantial\").        Appellants respond\n\nthat their presence on the vessel or even their knowledge that they\n\nwere transporting marijuana is insufficient to establish their\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fintent, see Guerrero, 114 F.3d at 342 (\"Mere presence at the scene\n\nor even knowledge that the crime is being committed is generally\n\ninsufficient     .    .   .    .\")    (internal    quotation       marks    omitted),\n\nparticularly since they claim to have only participated under\n\nduress.\n\n           Resolving          all    credibility   issues     in    favor    of    the\n\ngovernment, we find the record sufficiently complete to support a\n\nfinding beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellants committed the\n\ncrime charged.       The circumstantial evidence supports the inference\n\nof drug trafficking, and there is no evidence opposing the jury's\n\ndetermination that Appellants' testimony in support of their duress\n\ndefense was incredible. United States v. Spinney, 65 F.3d 231, 234\n\n(1st Cir. 1995) (affirming where a jury's \"inferences derive\n\nsupport   from   a    plausible       rendition    of   the   record\"      and    their\n\n\"conclusions flow rationally from those inferences\"); see also\n\nUnited States v. Cuevas-Esquivel, 905 F.2d 510, 514-15 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 498 U.S. 877 (1990)(quoting United States v. Smith,\n\n680 F.2d 255, 260 (1st Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 459 U.S. 1110\n\n(1983))(concluding that it is the province of the jury, not the\n\ncourt, to determine credibility of the witnesses, and noting that\n\n\"'[n]either juries nor judges are required to divorce themselves of\n\ncommon sense,' where, as here, the appellant[s'] portrayal of\n\nhimself    as        an       innocent      bystander[s]       is       'inherently\n\nunbelievable.'\").\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\fE.   Pre-trial Ruling on the Defense of Duress\n\n            Prior to trial, Appellants sought to present a defense of\n\nduress.    The district court stated that it would not rule on a\n\nduress    instruction   to     the   jury    until   after    Appellants     had\n\ntestified, if they were willing to do so, and only if the court\n\ndetermined that Appellants met the standard for the submission of\n\nthe charge to the jury.\n\n            The   burden     of   proof    to   demonstrate    duress   is   on\n\nAppellants.    United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d 288, 291 (1st Cir.\n\n1992).    In order to establish a claim of duress, the defendant must\n\nshow that: (1) he acted under an immediate threat of serious bodily\n\ninjury; (2) he had a well-grounded belief that the threat would be\n\ncarried out; and (3) he had no reasonable opportunity to escape or\n\notherwise frustrate the threat.           United States v. Arthurs, 73 F.3d\n\n444, 448 (1st Cir. 1996).            A trial court may refuse a duress\n\ninstruction if insufficient evidence is presented.             Id.\n\n            After Appellants presented their case for duress, the\n\ncourt found that the Appellants met the requisite burden of proof\n\nand instructed the jury as to a defense of duress.                   The jury,\n\nhowever, did not find that Appellants were acting under duress.\n\nAppellants Bravo and Martínez now claim that, because the court did\n\nnot rule on the applicability of a duress offense until after the\n\nclose of all evidence, they were denied the opportunity to choose\n\na defense strategy in advance and participate in a fair trial.\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\f           The district court clearly has the discretion to either\n\nemploy a pre-trial hearing or to wait until after all evidence has\n\nbeen heard at trial, to determine whether the evidence of duress is\n\nsufficient as a matter of law to warrant an instruction. See, e.g.,\n\nUnited States v. Bailey, 444 U.S. 394, 399-401 (1980) (upholding\n\nthe convictions of four defendants, three of whom, at their joint\n\ntrial,   were   denied   a   duress    instruction   after    the   close   of\n\nevidence, and the fourth defendant who, at a separate trial, was\n\ndenied a duress instruction prior to trial).                 Indeed, we are\n\nunaware of any case mandating a pre-trial determination of the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence for a duress defense.             Moreover, the\n\nrecord indicates that Appellants were not prevented from arguing at\n\ntrial that Appellants were acting under duress, or from presenting\n\nevidence to the jury, including the testimony of each Appellant,\n\nallegedly demonstrating that they acted under duress.               Thus, the\n\ndistrict court did not err by denying Appellants a pre-trial\n\ndetermination on their duress defense.\n\nF.   Sentencing\n\n           1.   Adjustment for Minor Participation\n\n           Appellants claim that the district court erred in failing\n\nto grant them a two-level downward adjustment in their base offense\n\nlevel due to their alleged minor participation in the offense, as\n\ncompared to Cardona-Sandoval, the captain of the vessel.              We will\n\nonly reverse the district court's finding that Appellants were not\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fminor participants if that finding is clearly erroneous.            United\n\nStates v. Villarman-Oviedo, 325 F.3d 1, 16-17 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\nAppellants bear the burden of proving that they are entitled to\n\ndownward adjustments for their roles in the offense. United States\n\nv. Tom, 330 F.3d 83, 95 (1st Cir. 2003).       If the record supports at\n\nleast two permissible inferences, the factfinder's choice between\n\nor among them cannot be clearly erroneous. Villarman-Oviedo, 325\n\nF.3d at 16.      Accordingly, we rarely reverse a district court's\n\ndecision regarding whether to apply a minor role adjustment.            Tom,\n\n330 F.3d at 95.\n\n            A downward adjustment for a defendant's minor role in an\n\noffense is permitted for a defendant \"who is less culpable than\n\nmost other participants, but whose role could not be described as\n\nminimal.\"    U.S.S.G. § 3B1.2(b), cmt., n.5.        Here, although the PSR\n\nrecommended that a two-level adjustment be granted, the government\n\nobjected    to   the   recommendation,    arguing   that   Appellants   were\n\nculpable to the same degree because they were all members of the\n\nvessel's crew, equally advancing the same venture.              Appellants\n\nargued that because none of them were the captain of the vessel,\n\nbut rather crew members, with less significant functions than the\n\ncaptain, they held minor roles.          In denying the adjustment, the\n\nsentencing court ruled that it could not differentiate the major\n\nfrom the minor participants in the case.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\f              While we acknowledge that the record indicates that\n\nCardona-Sandoval was the captain of the vessel, and that Appellants\n\nwere the crew, it is not clear that the sentencing judge erred in\n\ndenying the adjustment.        Appellants failed to demonstrate that any\n\nof them were less culpable than the others, United States v.\n\nBrandon, 17 F.3d 409, 460 (1st Cir. 1994) (affirming denial of\n\nminor participant adjustment where defendant was less culpable than\n\nthe major participants, but not less culpable than most of the\n\nother defendants), or that their participation was less than the\n\naverage participation in the venture, United States v. Osorio, 929\n\nF.2d 753, 764 (1st Cir. 1991).          Accordingly, we cannot find that\n\nthe district court's denial of the adjustment was in error.\n\n              2.   The Safety Valve Benefit\n\n              Bravo, Isaa and Mancilla each appeal the district court's\n\ndenial of their safety-valve petitions.             A defendant bears the\n\nburden   of    demonstrating    his   entitlement   for   the   safety-valve\n\nreduction.     United States v. Rodríguez-Ortiz, 455 F.3d 18, 25 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).        To qualify for this benefit, the defendant must\n\ndemonstrate, among other things,7 that he truthfully provided the\n\n\n7\n   To qualify for the safety valve, defendants must satisfy the\nfollowing five criteria, the first four of which are not in dispute\nin the instant appeal: (1) not have more than one criminal history\npoint; (2) not have used violence or possessed a firearm during\ncommission of the offense; (3) not have killed or seriously injured\nanother person; (4) not have been a leader or manager in the\noffense or was involved in a continuing criminal enterprise; and\n(5) have truthfully provided the government with all information\nand evidence he possesses concerning the offense. 18 U.S.C. § 3553\n\n                                      -21-\n\fgovernment with all the information and evidence he possesses\n\nconcerning the offense.        18 U.S.C. § 3553 (f)(5).8           Indeed,\n\n\"nothing short of truthful and complete disclosure shall suffice.\"\n\nUnited States v. Bermúdez, 407 F.3d 536, 542 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(quoting United States v. Matos, 328 F.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir. 2003));\n\nUnited States v. Richardson, 225 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir. 2000) (not\n\nclearly erroneous to deny safety valve benefit where the defendant\n\nfailed to divulge information he possessed concerning the crime at\n\nthe proffer session).\n\n           The district court's finding on eligibility must be \"an\n\nindependent determination,\" United States v. White, 119 F.3d 70, 73\n\n(1st Cir. 1997), resting on more than \"bare conclusions,\" United\n\nStates v. Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d 517, 528 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nAlthough it is preferable that the court support its decision with\n\n\"specific factual findings,\" a district court may rest its decision\n\non   conclusory   statements   if    those    conclusions   have   \"easily\n\nrecognizable support in the record.\"         See id. at 529.\n\n           Unfortunately, the district court failed to make even\n\nconclusory statements as to why Bravo did not merit safety-valve\n\nrelief. The record shows that Bravo's repeated attempts to discuss\n\nhis safety-valve eligibility were rebuffed by summary denials of\n\n\n\n(f).\n8\n   It is not disputed that the three Appellants seeking the safety\nvalve in the instant appeal meet the first four criteria.\n\n                                    -22-\n\fhis eligibility by the district court.                          The district court's\n\nfailure to provide any explanation of its reasoning for denial\n\nfalls well below the standard set in Miranda-Santiago, 96 F.3d at\n\n528-29. Accordingly, we remand Bravo's safety-valve determination\n\nfor reconsideration by the court.\n\n               In the case of Isaa and Mancilla, the district court's\n\nsafety-valve determinations were based on analysis of the facts of\n\nthe case.        We therefore review those determinations for clear\n\nerror.    United States v. Márquez, 280 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(\"To     the    extent   that        [a   safety     valve]      ruling    depends     on\n\ndifferential factfinding, we review it for clear error.\").                          If we\n\nfind that the record, taken as a whole, will not support a finding\n\nthat the defendants failed to provide a truthful and complete\n\nproffer, the government must demonstrate more than a simple lack of\n\nconfidence that the proffer is complete to justify the denial of\n\nthe safety valve.        Id. at 24.\n\n               At Isaa's and Mancilla's joint hearing, the district\n\ncourt    credited    the    testimony        of    Special      Agent    Gonzáles     that\n\nAppellants had not disclosed everything they knew about the drug\n\nsmuggling      conspiracy       --    that    while       the    story    proferred    by\n\nAppellants was consistent, it was \"illogical\" and \"incredible\" that\n\nan   international       drug    smuggler         would    place    $7.5    million     of\n\nnarcotics on a vessel traveling in international waters without\n\nhaving some type of voluntary control over the vessel's crew. This\n\n\n                                          -23-\n\ftestimony is more than a statement of no confidence. The testimony\n\nof Special Agent Gonzáles, based on his years of experience in the\n\nfield of drug interdiction, provides a sound grounding for the\n\ndistrict court's denial of the safety valve.   If there is any error\n\nhere by the district court, it certainly is not clear.\n\n          3.   Downward Departure for Duress\n\n          Even though the jury rejected Appellants' duress defense,\n\nthe district court still had the authority to grant a downward\n\ndeparture under the guidelines at sentencing.    U.S.S.G. § 5K2.12;\n\nUnited States v. Sachdev, 279 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir. 2002).   \"[T]he\n\ntype and kind of evidence necessary to support a downward departure\n\npremised on duress is somewhat less than that necessary to support\n\na defense of duress at trial.\"    United States v. Amparo, 961 F.2d\n\n288, 292 (1st Cir. 1992).        However, on appeal, we only have\n\njurisdiction to review if \"the sentencing court's failure to depart\n\ndid not represent an exercise of factfinding or discretion, but was\n\ninstead the product of the court's miscalculation about whether it\n\npossessed the authority to depart.\" Id.; see also United States v.\n\nTeeter, 257 F.3d 14, 30 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding that this Court\n\nwould not entertain an appeal of a denial of a departure for duress\n\nunless it had a reason to believe that the trial court did not\n\nunderstand its options).\n\n          This case does not fall within the exception: Appellants\n\ndo not theorize that the sentencing judge was unaware of his power\n\n\n                                 -24-\n\fto depart or misconceived the legal standard.                   Instead, Appellants\n\nchallenge    the       district   court's     discretionary       decision     not   to\n\ndepart.   It follows inexorably that we lack jurisdiction to review\n\nthe assigned error.\n\n            4.     Booker Claim\n\n            While the instant appeal was pending, the Supreme Court\n\ndecided United States v. Booker, striking down the provision of the\n\nSentencing       Reform    Act     that    made    the       sentencing     guidelines\n\nmandatory, and holding that district courts are not bound by the\n\nguidelines but must consult them and take them into account when\n\nsentencing.      543 U.S. 220, 258, 264 (2005).              One of the Appellants,\n\nIsaa, now claims that he is entitled to a remand for resentencing\n\npursuant to Booker because he was sentenced under the mandatory\n\nguidelines and the court did not consider, as required, all the\n\nsentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).\n\n            If    Isaa     was    sentenced      under   a    mandatory     guidelines\n\nsystem, we will \"remand for resentencing where 'either in the\n\nexisting record or by plausible proffer, there is a reasonable\n\nindication that the district judge might well have reached a\n\ndifferent result under advisory guidelines.'\"                     United States v.\n\nLewis, 406 F.3d 11, 21 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting United States v.\n\nHeldeman, 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir. 2005)).                    Isaa, however, was\n\nnot sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system.                    Rather, he was\n\nsentenced    to    a    statutory    mandatory      minimum      of   120   months   of\n\n\n                                          -25-\n\fimprisonment for intending to distribute more than 1000 kilograms\n\nof marijuana, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. § 960(b)(1)(G).   Accordingly,\n\nIsaa does not have a cognizable Booker claim. \"A mandatory minimum\n\nsentence imposed as required by a statute based on facts found by\n\na jury or admitted by a defendant is not a candidate for Booker\n\nerror.\" United States v. Antonakopoulos, 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir.\n\n2005); United States v.

After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 18, 2004, at approximately 4:45 A.M., the United States Coast Guard (\"USCG\") cutter DEPENDABLE found the M/V EL CONQUISTADOR (the \"vessel\") riding low and \"dead in the water\" in international waters 180 nautical miles south of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. A Rigid Hulled Inflatable Boat, the ABLE 2, was launched from the DEPENDABLE to approach the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ABLE 2 observed that the vessel's name was written on its stern, but the vessel did not have a visible registration number, port identification, or country flag. On board the ABLE 2, Officer Brian Hennessey (\"Hennessey\"), a technician and federal law enforcement officer with the USCG, requested that the vessel indicate its nationality. The vessel master answered that the vessel was registered in Colombia. He further claimed that the vessel had been fishing for approximately seven to eight days, but that the vessel's engines were broken, and that they had no fish on board and were en route to Haiti.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Hennessey testified that he perceived a strong smell of marijuana coming from the vessel. Hennessey relayed via radio the information from the vessel master to the DEPENDABLE and waited for permission to board the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 7:39 A.M., Sean Connett (\"Connett\"), an employee with the USCG at the District Command Center in Miami, contacted the Colombian authorities to confirm the registry of the vessel via a written form entitled \"Action Request.\" The Colombian authorities shortly responded with a \"Response to the Action\" form, indicating that they could neither confirm nor refute that the EL CONQUISTADOR was a Colombian vessel. The Colombian authorities also suggested that the USCG proceed under \"international law\" and requested that the USCG inform them of the results of the inspection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acting on the premise that the vessel was \"stateless\" or \"without nationality,\" the USCG sought to place the vessel within U.S. jurisdiction. The Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (\"MDLEA\") allows the United States to conduct drug law enforcement outside of the United States, and more specifically, exercise jurisdiction over stateless vessels. 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c). In accordance with the MDLEA, Connett requested and received a \"Statement of No Objection\" from the USCG headquarters in Washington, D.C., granting permission to board EL CONQUISTADOR. Connett forwarded the Statement to the USCG office in San Juan, which then forwarded it to the DEPENDABLE.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon boarding the vessel, Hennessey observed what appeared to be bales of marijuana, two of which were outside the fish hold, forty-six of which were inside the fish hold.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> He then conducted a field test confirming that the bales were, in fact, marijuana. In order to access the bales, USCG officers broke the fish hold, and transferred the bales onto the DEPENDABLE.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The vessel's five crew members &#8212; the four Appellants and the captain, Joaqu&#237;n Emilio Cardona-Sandoval (\"Cardona-Sandoval\") &#8212; were also brought on board the DEPENDABLE. The Colombian authorities were notified of the USCG's findings, and upon arrival in San Juan, the Appellants were transferred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") and detained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At their joint trial, Appellants testified that they were fisherman in their home country of Colombia and that in 2004 they were recruited in Colombia to participate in a fishing expedition by two individuals known to them as \"Paco\" and \"Roberto.\" Appellants testified that they were unacquainted with each other when they arrived at the vessel. They further testified that when they arrived, Paco and Roberto, along with others, were armed with weapons, and marijuana was on the vessel. According to Appellants, Paco threatened that Appellants' families would be killed if they did not take the marijuana to Haiti. Appellants testified that they feared for their families. After a few days at sea, the vessel broke down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 7, 2004, a jury found all four Appellants guilty of both counts of the indictment. A pre-sentencing report (\"PSR\") was then filed on November 18, 2004, recommending that Appellants be granted a two-point reduction in their base offense level of 32 due to their minor roles in the offense. At Appellants' various sentencing hearings, the government opposed the minor role reduction. The court denied the minor role adjustments, indicating that the evidence was such that it could not state who was a major and who was a minor participant in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At his sentencing hearing, Appellant Mart&#237;nez raised no objections to the PSR, and accordingly, was not granted any adjustments, and was sentenced to 120 months imprisonment. In the other sentencing hearings, Appellants Bravo, Isaa and Mancilla objected to the PSR and requested a safety-valve benefit, as well as a downward departure for duress. Appellants participated in a government debriefing in order to qualify for the safety-valve benefit, but they each received a sealed motion from the government stating that the safety-valve would not be recommended because the government did not believe that Appellants had provided all available information in a truthful manner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> A hearing was held to determine Appellants' entitlement to the safety-valve benefit. A DEA special agent testified that, although Appellants' stories coincided in certain aspects, it was abnormal that Appellants did not know the details of how the drug transfer was going to take place. He explained that the scenario was \"too risky\" to be believable; he had never investigated a case in which a drug trafficker had placed unknown individuals against their wills on a vessel loaded with contraband of such value without providing information about the transfer, or without agreeing to any payment. The agent also noticed that, based on his experience and training, Appellants appeared to easily answer \"non-stressful\" questions about their families and Colombia, but that a level of stress or deception was perceptible in Appellants' answers to questions regarding the smuggling venture, the drugs, and payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court denied the safety-valve benefit, indicating that the consistency of Appellants' statements did not overcome the gaps in the logic of their story. It then went on to also deny Appellants' request for a downward departure for duress. Again, the court indicated that it did not find Appellants' stories to be totally truthful. Each Appellant was then sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum term of 120 months of imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants now appeal a variety of issues regarding their convictions and sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Issues on Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The United States' Jurisdiction over the Vessel</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants are neither citizens nor resident aliens of the United States and the vessel involved was not a vessel of the United States. Thus, for Appellants to be prosecuted under the MDLEA, the vessel must be \"subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.\" 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(a). Whether the district court erred in determining that it had jurisdiction over the vessel, and therefore over Appellants, is a question of law subject to <i>de novo</i> review. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1903(f) (\"All jurisdictional issues arising under this chapter are preliminary questions of law . . . .\"); <i>see also United States v. Gonz&#225;lez,</i> 311 F.3d 440, 443 (1st Cir.2002)(\"The term `jurisdiction' . . . evidently refers to the substantive reach of the <i>statute</i> &#8212; applying to some vessels but not others &#8212; and not to subject matter jurisdiction of the court.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the MDLEA, \"a `vessel subject to the jurisdiction of the United States' includes . . . a vessel without nationality.\" 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c)(1)(A). Additionally, \"a `vessel without nationality' includes . . . a vessel aboard which the master or person in charge makes a claim of registry and the claimed nation of registry does not affirmatively and unequivocally assert that the vessel is of its nationality.\" <i>Id.</i> &#167; 1903(c)(2)(C). Here, the vessel master claimed registry in Colombia, and after contacting the appropriate Colombian authorities, the USCG received a \"Response to the Action\" form from Colombia neither confirming nor refuting the vessel's registration in Colombia. Since Colombia, as the nation of alleged registry, could not confirm the vessel's registration, the vessel qualifies as a \"vessel without nationality\" under the MDLEA, and is within the jurisdiction of the federal courts of the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under the plain language of the MDLEA, Appellants' argument that jurisdiction includes a nexus requirement &#8212; <i>i.e.,</i> a requirement that the government show that the marijuana transported in the vessel would affect the United States, fails. The Appellants' reliance on <i>United States v. Hayes,</i> 653 F.2d 8 (1st Cir.1981) (finding a jurisdictional nexus requirement for the application of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act of 1970, &#167; 1013, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 963, to a vessel apprehended in international waters) and <i>United States v. Cafiero,</i> 242 F.Supp.2d 49 (D.Mass.2003) (finding a jurisdictional nexus requirement for the application of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act of 1970, &#167;&#167; 401, 404, 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841, 844, to an Italian citizen aboard a flight that made an unplanned diversion into United States territory), is misplaced. Those cases find a jurisdictional nexus requirement in the Comprehensive Drug Abuse and Control Act of 1970. We do not read the MDLEA to require a jurisdictional nexus. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Cardales,</i> 168 F.3d 548, 553 (1st Cir.1999) (\"[D]ue process does not require the government to prove a nexus between a defendant's criminal conduct and the United States in a prosecution under the MDLEA . . . .\"); <i>United States v. Rendon,</i> 354 F.3d 1320, 1325 (11th Cir. 2003)(\"[T]his circuit . . . ha[s] not embellished the MDLEA with a nexus requirement.\"); <i>United States v. Moreno-Morillo,</i> 334 F.3d 819 (9th Cir.2003) (holding that Congress did not act under its Commerce Clause authority in enacting the MDLEA and, thus, \"no nexus between the activities proscribed by the MDLEA and interstate or foreign commerce\" is required); <i>United States v. Suerte,</i> 291 F.3d 366, 375 (5th Cir.2002) (\"[T]o the extent the Due Process Clause may constrain the MDLEA's extraterritorial reach, that clause does not impose a nexus requirement.\"); <i>United States v. Mart&#237;nez-Hidalgo,</i> 993 F.2d 1052, 1056 (3d Cir.1993) (finding no nexus requirement in the MDLEA to search stateless vessel in international waters).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Equally misplaced is Appellants' contention that the United States disregarded the recommendation of the Colombian authorities to follow \"international law\" when apprehending the vessel. The USCG acted within both international treaty law and customary international law. The Agreement to Suppress Illicit Traffic by Sea, ratified and brought into force by the United States and Colombia in 1997, is the treaty governing the apprehension of the vessel and its crew. Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Colombia to Suppress Illicit Traffic by Sea, Feb. 20, 1997, T.I.A.S. No. 12835. The treaty authorizes the country requesting verification of a registry to \"proceed in accordance with international law\" in the event that neither party can confirm or refute a flag claim of a vessel in international waters, <i>id.</i> art. 8, and the MDLEA is in compliance with international law. The extra-territorial jurisdiction authorized in the MDLEA is consistent with the \"protective principle\" of international law, <i>see Cardales,</i> 168 F.3d at 553 (explaining that the protective principle permits a nation \"`to assert jurisdiction over a person whose conduct outside the nation's territory threatens the nation's security'\") (quoting <i>United States v. Robinson,</i> 843 F.2d 1, 3 (1st Cir.1988)), and is supported by numerous international treaties and agreements, including the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, Mar. 30 1961, 18 U.S.T. 1407, and its 1972 Protocol, Amendment of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, Mar. 25, 1972, 26 U.S.T. 1439; the Convention on Narcotic Drugs: Psychotropic Substances, Feb. 21, 1971, 32 U.S.T. 543; the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, Dec. 10, 1982, S. Treaty Doc. No. 103-39, 1833 U.N.T.S. 3; and the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, Dec. 20, 1988, 28 I.L.M. 493.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion is without doubt or reservation: the United States had jurisdiction over the vessel, and was correct to apply the MDLEA to Appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">B. Lack of Pre-trial Determination of Jurisdiction</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Appellants assert that the district court erroneously allowed the jury to hear testimony regarding jurisdiction. We agree. \"All jurisdictional issues arising under [the MDLEA] are preliminary questions of law to be determined solely by the trial judge.\" 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(f). The exposure of the jury to the jurisdictional testimony nonetheless was harmless. Non-constitutional evidentiary error is harmless \"so long as it is highly probable that the error did not influence the verdict.\" <i>United States v. Flemmi,</i> 402 F.3d 79, 95 (1st Cir.2005) (internal quotation marks omitted). Here, that standard is met because the jury was presented with ample evidence that the Appellants possessed marijuana, and that they did so with the intent to distribute it. Moreover, the jury was instructed on the issues that it had to determine, and instructed that jurisdiction over the vessel was not an issue in the case, making it even more unlikely that the error affected the jury's verdict. <i>See id.</i> (finding that a non-constitutional evidentiary error was harmless because the jury was presented with ample evidence of the defendant's guilt, and the judge correctly instructed the jury).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. Motion to Suppress</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants challenge the denial of their pre-trial motion to suppress the bales of marijuana seized from the vessel on the grounds that the USCG lacked reasonable suspicion to stop and search the vessel, in violation of the Fourth Amendment. We apply a mixed standard of review to the district court's denial of the suppression motion, reviewing the court's findings of fact for clear error and the application of the law to those facts <i>de novo. Tinoco,</i> 304 F.3d at 1116.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Fourth Amendment prohibits \"unreasonable searches and seizures\" whether or not the evidence is sought to be used in a criminal trial, and a violation of the Amendment is \"fully accomplished\" at the time of an unreasonable government intrusion. <i>United States v. Calandra,</i> 414 U.S. 338, 354, 94 S.Ct. 613, 38 L.Ed.2d 561 (1974); <i>see also United States v. Leon,</i> 468 U.S. 897, 906, 104 S.Ct. 3405, 82 L.Ed.2d 677 (1984). For purposes of this case, therefore, if there was a constitutional violation of the Fourth Amendment, it occurred solely in international waters, where the search and seizure took place. But the Fourth Amendment does not apply to activities of the United States against aliens in international waters. <i>See United States v. Verdugo-Urquidez,</i> 494 U.S. 259, 267, 110 S.Ct. 1056, 108 L.Ed.2d 222 (1990). The Supreme Court's holding in <i>Verdugo-Urquidez</i> is clear that the actions of the United States directed against aliens in foreign territory or in international waters are not constrained by the Fourth Amendment. 494 U.S. at 267, 110 S.Ct. 1056 (\"There is . . . no indication that the Fourth Amendment was understood by contemporaries of the Framers to apply to activities of the United States directed against aliens in foreign territory or in international waters.\"); <i>see also United States v. Vilches-Navarrete,</i> 413 F.Supp.2d 60, 69 (D.P.R.2006) (\"In light of the Supreme Court's holding in <i>Verdugo-Urquidez,</i> it is pellucid that the Fourth Amendment does not apply to the search of non-resident aliens on a ship in international waters.\"). Accordingly, the district court was correct in denying Appellants' motion to suppress because the Fourth Amendment was inapplicable to the USCG's search of the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">D. Sufficiency of the Evidence to Convict</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants moved for judgment of acquittal, pursuant to Fed.R.Crim.P. 29, after the conclusion of the Government's case in chief and again after the close of all the evidence. The district court denied both motions. Here, Appellants claim that the evidence is insufficient to establish beyond a reasonable doubt that they had the required intent to violate the laws of the United States. Specifically, Appellants allege that the evidence is insufficient to establish that they intended to distribute the marijuana, as required by 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(a), <i>see United States v. Guerrero,</i> 114 F.3d 332, 339 (1st Cir.1997), or that they sought by their actions to make the trafficking venture succeed, as required by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2, <i>see id.</i> at 341-42. \"We review Rule 29 determinations <i>de novo,</i> resolving any evidentiary conflicts or credibility issues in the government's favor.\" <i>Id.</i> at 339. \"If the evidence, viewed under this lens, permits a rational jury to find . . . the crime charged beyond a reasonable doubt, then the evidence is legally sufficient.\" <i>Id.</i> (internal quotation marks omitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In circumstantial cases such as this one, the evidence is sufficient to convict if it adequately supports the \"the requisite two-step inference\": (1) that the vessel was engaged in obviously illegal activity, and (2) that each Appellant was ready to assist in the criminal enterprise. <i>United States v. Jim&#233;nez-P&#233;rez,</i> 869 F.2d 9, 11 (1st Cir.1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). The government argues that the jury could have reasonably drawn this two-step inference from the evidence (i) that the Appellants admitted to knowing that marijuana was on the vessel before or shortly after the vessel departed, (ii) that the Appellants did not seek to return to Colombia nor destroy the marijuana, and (iii) that although the Appellants claimed that they thought they were going on a fishing expedition, the vessel lacked fish, usable fishing nets, line gear or refrigeration. <i>See United States v. Batista-Polanco,</i> 927 F.2d 14, 17 (1st Cir.1991) (holding that the evidence \"may be entirely circumstantial\"). Appellants respond that their presence on the vessel or even their knowledge that they were transporting marijuana is insufficient to establish their intent, <i>see Guerrero,</i> 114 F.3d at 342 (\"Mere presence at the scene or even knowledge that the crime is being committed is generally insufficient. . . .\") (internal quotation marks omitted), particularly since they claim to have only participated under duress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Resolving all credibility issues in favor of the government, we find the record sufficiently complete to support a finding beyond a reasonable doubt that Appellants committed the crime charged. The circumstantial evidence supports the inference of drug trafficking, and there is no evidence opposing the jury's determination that Appellants' testimony in support of their duress defense was incredible. <i>United States v. Spinney,</i> 65 F.3d 231, 234 (1st Cir.1995) (affirming where a jury's \"inferences derive support from a plausible rendition of the record\" and their \"conclusions flow rationally from those inferences\"); <i>see also United States v. Cuevas-Esquivel,</i> 905 F.2d 510, 514-15 (1st Cir.), <i>cert. denied,</i> 498 U.S. 877, 111 S.Ct. 208, 112 L.Ed.2d 169 (1990)(quoting <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 680 F.2d 255, 260 (1st Cir.1982), <i>cert. denied,</i> 459 U.S. 1110, 103 S.Ct. 738, 74 L.Ed.2d 960 (1983))(concluding that it is the province of the jury, not the court, to determine credibility of the witnesses, and noting that \"`[n]either juries nor judges are required to divorce themselves of common sense,' where, as here, the appellant[s'] portrayal of himself as an innocent bystander[s] is `inherently unbelievable.'\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">E.

The district court stated that it would not rule on a duress instruction to the jury until after Appellants had testified, if they were willing to do so, and only if the court determined that Appellants met the standard for the submission of the charge to the jury.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The burden of proof to demonstrate duress is on Appellants. <i>United States v. Amparo,</i> 961 F.2d 288, 291 (1st Cir.1992). In order to establish a claim of duress, the defendant must show that: (1) he acted under an immediate threat of serious bodily injury; (2) he had a well-grounded belief that the threat would be carried out; and (3) he had no reasonable opportunity to escape or otherwise frustrate the threat. <i>United States v. Arthurs,</i> 73 F.3d 444, 448 (1st Cir.1996). A trial court may refuse a duress instruction if insufficient evidence is presented. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After Appellants presented their case for duress, the court found that the Appellants met the requisite burden of proof and instructed the jury as to a defense of duress. The jury, however, did not find that Appellants were acting under duress. Appellants Bravo and Mart&#237;nez now claim that, because the court did not rule on the applicability of a duress offense until after the close of all evidence, they were denied the opportunity to choose a defense strategy in advance and participate in a fair trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court clearly has the discretion to either employ a pre-trial hearing or to wait until after all evidence has been heard at trial, to determine whether the evidence of duress is sufficient as a matter of law to warrant an instruction. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Bailey,</i> 444 U.S. 394, 399-401, 100 S.Ct. 624, 62 L.Ed.2d 575 (1980) (upholding the convictions of four defendants, three of whom, at their joint trial, were denied a duress instruction after the close of evidence, and the fourth defendant who, at a separate trial, was denied a duress instruction prior to trial). Indeed, we are unaware of any case mandating a pre-trial determination of the sufficiency of the evidence for a duress defense. Moreover, the record indicates that Appellants were not prevented from arguing at trial that Appellants were acting under duress, or from presenting evidence to the jury, including the testimony of each Appellant, allegedly demonstrating that they acted under duress. Thus, the district court did not err by denying Appellants a pre-trial determination on their duress defense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">F. Sentencing</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. Adjustment for Minor Participation</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants claim that the district court erred in failing to grant them a two-level downward adjustment in their base offense level due to their alleged minor participation in the offense, as compared to Cardona-Sandoval, the captain of the vessel. We will only reverse the district court's finding that Appellants were not minor participants if that finding is clearly erroneous. <i>United States v. Villarman-Oviedo,</i> 325 F.3d 1, 16-17 (1st Cir.2003). Appellants bear the burden of proving that they are entitled to downward adjustments for their roles in the offense. <i>United States v. Tom,</i> 330 F.3d 83, 95 (1st Cir. 2003). If the record supports at least two permissible inferences, the factfinder's choice between or among them cannot be clearly erroneous. <i>Villarman-Oviedo,</i> 325 F.3d at 16. Accordingly, we rarely reverse a district court's decision regarding whether to apply a minor role adjustment. <i>Tom,</i> 330 F.3d at 95.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A downward adjustment for a defendant's minor role in an offense is permitted for a defendant \"who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b), cmt., n. 5. Here, although the PSR recommended that a two-level adjustment be granted, the government objected to the recommendation, arguing that Appellants were culpable to the same degree because they were all members of the vessel's crew, equally advancing the same venture. Appellants argued that because none of them were the captain of the vessel, but rather crew members, with less significant functions than the captain, they held minor roles. In denying the adjustment, the sentencing court ruled that it could not differentiate the major from the minor participants in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we acknowledge that the record indicates that Cardona-Sandoval was the captain of the vessel, and that Appellants were the crew, it is not clear that the sentencing judge erred in denying the adjustment. Appellants failed to demonstrate that any of them were less culpable than the others, <i>United States v. Brandon,</i> 17 F.3d 409, 460 (1st Cir.1994) (affirming denial of minor participant adjustment where defendant was less culpable than the major participants, but not less culpable than most of the other defendants), or that their participation was less than the average participation in the venture, <i>United States v. Osorio,</i> 929 F.2d 753, 764 (1st Cir.1991). Accordingly, we cannot find that the district court's denial of the adjustment was in error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. The Safety Valve Benefit</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant bears the burden of demonstrating his entitlement for the safety valve reduction. <i>United States v. Rodr&#237;guez-Ortiz,</i> 455 F.3d 18, 25 (1st Cir. 2006). To qualify for this benefit, the defendant must demonstrate, among other things,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> that he truthfully provided the government with all the information and evidence he possesses concerning the offense. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)(5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Indeed, \"nothing short of truthful and complete disclosure shall suffice.\" <i>United States v. Berm&#250;dez,</i> 407 F.3d 536, 542 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>United States v. Matos,</i> 328 F.3d 34, 38 (1st Cir.2003)); <i>United States v. Richardson,</i> 225 F.3d 46, 53 (1st Cir.2000) (not clearly erroneous to deny safety valve benefit where the defendant failed to divulge information he possessed concerning the crime at the proffer session).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since, in this case, the district court's safety valve determination was based on analysis of the facts of the case, we review the determination for clear error. <i>United States v. M&#225;rquez,</i> 280 F.3d 19, 22 (1st Cir.2002) (\"To the extent that [a safety valve] ruling depends on differential factfinding, we review it for clear error.\"). If we find that the record, taken as a whole, will not support a finding that the defendant has failed to provide a truthful and complete proffer, the government must demonstrate more than a simple lack of confidence that the proffer is complete to justify the denial of the safety valve. <i>Id.</i> at 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, at the sentencing hearing, the district court credited the testimony of Special Agent Gonz&#225;les that Appellants had not disclosed everything they knew about the drug smuggling conspiracy &#8212; that while the story proffered by Appellants was consistent, it was \"illogical\" and \"incredible\" that an international drug smuggler would place $7.5 million of narcotics on a vessel traveling in international waters without having some type of voluntary control over the vessel's crew. This testimony is more than a statement of no confidence. The testimony of Special Agent Gonz&#225;les, based on his years of experience in the field of drug interdiction, provides a sound grounding for the district court's denial of the safety valve. If there is any error here by the district court, it certainly is not clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Downward Departure for Duress</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the jury rejected Appellants' duress defense, the district court still had the authority to grant a downward departure under the guidelines at sentencing. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.12; <i>United States v. Sachdev,</i> 279 F.3d 25, 28 (1st Cir.2002). \"[T]he type and kind of evidence necessary to support a downward departure premised on duress is somewhat less than that necessary to support a defense of duress at trial.\" <i>United States v. Amparo,</i> 961 F.2d 288, 292 (1st Cir.1992). However, on appeal, we only have jurisdiction to review if \"the sentencing court's failure to depart did not represent an exercise of factfinding or discretion, but was instead the product of the court's miscalculation about whether it possessed the authority to depart.\" <i>Id.; see also United States v. Teeter,</i> 257 F.3d 14, 30 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding that this Court would not entertain an appeal of a denial of a departure for duress unless it had a reason to believe that the trial court did not understand its options).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case does not fall within the exception: Appellants do not theorize that the sentencing judge was unaware of his power to depart or misconceived the legal standard. Instead, Appellants challenge the district court's discretionary decision not to depart. It follows inexorably that we lack jurisdiction to review the assigned error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Booker</i> Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the instant appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided <i>United States v. Booker,</i> striking down the provision of the Sentencing Reform Act that made the sentencing guidelines mandatory, and holding that district courts are not bound by the guidelines but must consult them and take them into account when sentencing. 543 U.S. 220, 258, 264, 125 S.Ct. 738, 160 L.Ed.2d 621 (2005). One of the Appellants, Isaa, now claims that he is entitled to a remand for resentencing pursuant to <i>Booker</i> because he was sentenced under the mandatory guidelines and the court did not consider, as required, all the sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Isaa was sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system, we will \"remand for resentencing where `either in the existing record or by plausible proffer, there is a reasonable indication that the district judge might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines.'\" <i>United States v. Lewis,</i> 406 F.3d 11, 21 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> 402 F.3d 220, 224 (1st Cir.2005)). Isaa, however, was not sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system. Rather, he was sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months of imprisonment for intending to distribute more than 1000 kilograms of marijuana, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(1)(G). Accordingly, Isaa does not have a cognizable <i>Booker</i> claim. \"A mandatory minimum sentence imposed as required by a statute based on facts found by a jury or admitted by a defendant is not a candidate for <i>Booker</i> error.\" <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> 399 F.3d 68, 76 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v. Berm&#250;dez,</i> 407 F.3d 536, 545 (1st Cir.2005) (\"Since Berm&#250;dez was sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum, rather than an erroneously mandatory guideline amount, no <i>Booker</i> error occurred.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.

After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I. Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 18, 2004, at approximately 4:45 A.M., the United States Coast Guard (\"USCG\") cutter DEPENDABLE found the M/V EL CONQUISTADOR (the \"vessel\") riding low and \"dead in the water\" in international waters 180 nautical miles south of Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic. A Rigid Hulled Inflatable Boat, the ABLE 2, was launched from the DEPENDABLE to approach the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The ABLE 2 observed that the vessel's name was written on its stern, but the vessel did not have a visible registration number, port identification, or country flag. On board the ABLE 2, Officer Brian Hennessey (\"Hennessey\"), a technician and federal law enforcement officer with the USCG, requested that the vessel indicate its nationality. The vessel master answered that the vessel was registered in Colombia. He further claimed that the vessel had been fishing for approximately seven to eight days, but that the vessel's engines were broken, and that they had no fish on board and were en route to Haiti.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> Hennessey testified that he perceived a strong smell of marijuana coming from the vessel. Hennessey relayed via radio the information from the vessel master to the DEPENDABLE and waited for permission to board the vessel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At 7:39 A.M., Sean Connett (\"Connett\"), an employee with the USCG at the District Command Center in Miami, contacted the Colombian authorities to confirm the registry of the vessel via a written form entitled \"Action Request.\" The Colombian authorities shortly responded with a \"Response to the Action\" form, indicating that they could neither confirm nor refute that the EL CONQUISTADOR was a Colombian vessel. The Colombian authorities also suggested that the USCG proceed under \"international law\" and requested that the USCG inform them of the results of the inspection.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Acting on the premise that the vessel was \"stateless\" or \"without nationality,\" the USCG sought to place the vessel within U.S. jurisdiction. The Maritime Drug Law Enforcement Act (\"MDLEA\") allows the United States to conduct drug law enforcement outside of the United States, and more specifically, exercise jurisdiction over stateless vessels. 46 U.S.C. app. &#167; 1903(c). In accordance with the MDLEA, Connett requested and received a \"Statement of No Objection\" from the USCG headquarters in Washington, D.C., granting permission to board EL CONQUISTADOR. Connett forwarded the Statement to the USCG office in San Juan, which then forwarded it to the DEPENDABLE.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon boarding the vessel, Hennessey observed what appeared to be bales of marijuana, two of which were outside the fish hold, forty-six of which were inside the fish hold.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> He then conducted a field test confirming that the bales were, in fact, marijuana. In order to access the bales, USCG officers broke the fish hold, and transferred the bales onto the DEPENDABLE.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The vessel's five crew members &#8212; the four Appellants and the captain, Joaqu&#237;n Emilio Cardona-Sandoval (\"Cardona-Sandoval\") &#8212; were also brought on board the DEPENDABLE. The Colombian authorities were notified of the USCG's findings, and upon arrival in San Juan, the Appellants were transferred to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (\"ICE\") and detained.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At their joint trial, Appellants testified that they were fisherman in their home country of Colombia and that in 2004 they were recruited in Colombia to participate in a fishing expedition by two individuals known to them as \"Paco\" and \"Roberto.\" Appellants testified that they were unacquainted with each other when they arrived at the vessel. They further testified that when they arrived, Paco and Roberto, along with others, were armed with weapons, and marijuana was on the vessel. According to Appellants, Paco threatened that Appellants' families would be killed if they did not take the marijuana to Haiti. Appellants testified that they feared for their families. After a few days at sea, the vessel broke down.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 7, 2004, a jury found all four Appellants guilty of both counts of the indictment. A pre-sentencing report (\"PSR\") was then filed on November 18, 2004, recommending that Appellants be granted a two-point reduction in their base offense level of 32 due to their minor roles in the offense. At Appellants' various sentencing hearings, the government opposed the minor role reduction. The court denied the minor role adjustments, indicating that the evidence was such that it could not state who was a major and who was a minor participant in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At his sentencing hearing, Appellant Mart&#237;nez raised no objections to the PSR, and accordingly, was not granted any adjustments, and was sentenced to 120 months imprisonment. In the other sentencing hearings, Appellants Bravo, Isaa and Mancilla objected to the PSR and requested a safety-valve benefit, as well as a downward departure for duress. Appellants participated in a government debriefing in order to qualify for the safety-valve benefit, but they each received a sealed motion from the government stating that the safety-valve would not be recommended because the government did not believe that Appellants had provided all available information in a truthful manner.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> A hearing was held to determine Appellants' entitlement to the safety-valve benefit. A DEA special agent testified that, although Appellants' stories coincided in certain aspects, it was abnormal that Appellants did not know the details of how the drug transfer was going to take place. He explained that the scenario was \"too risky\" to be believable; he had never investigated a case in which a drug trafficker had placed unknown individuals against their wills on a vessel loaded with contraband of such value without providing information about the transfer, or without agreeing to any payment. The agent also noticed that, based on his experience and training, Appellants appeared to easily answer \"non-stressful\" questions about their families and Colombia, but that a level of stress or deception was perceptible in Appellants' answers to questions regarding the smuggling venture, the drugs, and payments.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court denied the safety-valve benefit, indicating that the consistency of Appellants' statements did not overcome the gaps in the logic of their story. It then went on to also deny Appellants' request for a downward departure for duress. Again, the court indicated that it did not find Appellants' stories to be totally truthful. Each Appellant was then sentenced to the statutory mandatory minimum term of 120 months of imprisonment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants now appeal a variety of issues regarding their convictions and sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II. Issues on Appeal</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. The United States' Jurisdiction over the Vessel</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants are neither citizens nor resident aliens of the United States and the vessel involved was not a vessel of the United States.

If the record supports at least two permissible inferences, the factfinder's choice between or among them cannot be clearly erroneous. <i>Villarman-Oviedo,</i> 325 F.3d at 16. Accordingly, we rarely reverse a district court's decision regarding whether to apply a minor role adjustment. <i>Tom,</i> 330 F.3d at 95.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A downward adjustment for a defendant's minor role in an offense is permitted for a defendant \"who is less culpable than most other participants, but whose role could not be described as minimal.\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 3B1.2(b), cmt., n. 5. Here, although the PSR recommended that a two-level adjustment be granted, the government objected to the recommendation, arguing that Appellants were culpable to the same degree because they were all members of the vessel's crew, equally advancing the same venture. Appellants argued that because none of them were the captain of the vessel, but rather crew members, with less significant functions than the captain, they held minor roles. In denying the adjustment, the sentencing court ruled that it could not differentiate the major from the minor participants in the case.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we acknowledge that the record indicates that Cardona-Sandoval was the captain of the vessel, and that Appellants were the crew, it is not clear that the sentencing judge erred in denying the adjustment. Appellants failed to demonstrate that any of them were less culpable than the others, <i>United States v.

The Safety Valve Benefit</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A defendant bears the burden of demonstrating his entitlement for the safety valve reduction. <i>United States v.

To qualify for this benefit, the defendant must demonstrate, among other things,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> that he truthfully provided the government with all the information and evidence he possesses concerning the offense. 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(f)(5).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Indeed, \"nothing short of truthful and complete disclosure shall suffice.\" <i>United States v.

If we find that the record, taken as a whole, will not support a finding that the defendant has failed to provide a truthful and complete proffer, the government must demonstrate more than a simple lack of confidence that the proffer is complete to justify the denial of the safety valve. <i>Id.</i> at 24.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Here, at the sentencing hearing, the district court credited the testimony of Special Agent Gonz&#225;les that Appellants had not disclosed everything they knew about the drug smuggling conspiracy &#8212; that while the story proffered by Appellants was consistent, it was \"illogical\" and \"incredible\" that an international drug smuggler would place $7.5 million of narcotics on a vessel traveling in international waters without having some type of voluntary control over the vessel's crew. This testimony is more than a statement of no confidence. The testimony of Special Agent Gonz&#225;les, based on his years of experience in the field of drug interdiction, provides a sound grounding for the district court's denial of the safety valve. If there is any error here by the district court, it certainly is not clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">3. Downward Departure for Duress</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even though the jury rejected Appellants' duress defense, the district court still had the authority to grant a downward departure under the guidelines at sentencing. U.S.S.G. &#167; 5K2.12; <i>United States v. Sachdev,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199807\"><a href=\"/opinion/199807/united-states-v-sachdev/\"><span class=\"volume\">279</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">25</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.2002). \"[T]he type and kind of evidence necessary to support a downward departure premised on duress is somewhat less than that necessary to support a defense of duress at trial.\" <i>United States v. Amparo,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"581358\"><a href=\"/opinion/581358/united-states-v-luz-maria-amparo-aka-luz-maria-amparo-sanchez/\"><span class=\"volume\">961</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">288</span></a></span>, 292 (1st Cir.1992). However, on appeal, we only have jurisdiction to review if \"the sentencing court's failure to depart did not represent an exercise of factfinding or discretion, but was instead the product of the court's miscalculation about whether it possessed the authority to depart.\" <i>Id.; see also United States v. Teeter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199507\"><a href=\"/opinion/199507/united-states-v-teeter/\"><span class=\"volume\">257</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">14</span></a></span>, 30 (1st Cir. 2001) (holding that this Court would not entertain an appeal of a denial of a departure for duress unless it had a reason to believe that the trial court did not understand its options).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case does not fall within the exception: Appellants do not theorize that the sentencing judge was unaware of his power to depart or misconceived the legal standard. Instead, Appellants challenge the district court's discretionary decision not to depart. It follows inexorably that we lack jurisdiction to review the assigned error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Booker</i> Claim</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While the instant appeal was pending, the Supreme Court decided <i>United States v. Booker,</i> striking down the provision of the Sentencing Reform Act that made the sentencing guidelines mandatory, and holding that district courts are not bound by the guidelines but must consult them and take them into account when sentencing. <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">543</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></span>, 258, 264, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">125</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">738</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">160</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">621</span></span> (2005). One of the Appellants, Isaa, now claims that he is entitled to a remand for resentencing pursuant to <i>Booker</i> because he was sentenced under the mandatory guidelines and the court did not consider, as required, all the sentencing factors enumerated in 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If Isaa was sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system, we will \"remand for resentencing where `either in the existing record or by plausible proffer, there is a reasonable indication that the district judge might well have reached a different result under advisory guidelines.'\" <i>United States v. Lewis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201541\"><a href=\"/opinion/201541/united-states-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 21 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting <i>United States v. Heldeman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201512\"><a href=\"/opinion/201512/united-states-v-heldeman/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">220</span></a></span>, 224 (1st Cir.2005)). Isaa, however, was not sentenced under a mandatory guidelines system. Rather, he was sentenced to a statutory mandatory minimum of 120 months of imprisonment for intending to distribute more than 1000 kilograms of marijuana, pursuant to 21 U.S.C. &#167; 960(b)(1)(G). Accordingly, Isaa does not have a cognizable <i>Booker</i> claim. \"A mandatory minimum sentence imposed as required by a statute based on facts found by a jury or admitted by a defendant is not a candidate for <i>Booker</i> error.\" <i>United States v. Antonakopoulos,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201462\"><a href=\"/opinion/201462/united-states-v-antonakopoulos/\"><span class=\"volume\">399</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 76 (1st Cir.2005); <i>United States v.
