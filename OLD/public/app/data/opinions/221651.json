Mary M. Lisi, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n\n                               Before\n\n           Howard, Selya and Thompson, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n\n     William M.

We are entering an era in which\n\nretirement   benefits   paid   to   public   employees   are   subject   to\n\nheightened scrutiny. In this case, a municipality became convinced\n\nthat former firefighters and police officers who had retired on\n\ndisability pensions were collecting a particular benefit (full\n\nreimbursement of certain medical expenses) without legal warrant.\n\nThe municipality acted on this conviction and stopped paying the\n\ntab.   A group of affected retirees sued to enforce continued\n\npayment, alleging that the municipality's about-face violated state\n\nstatutes, constituted an ultra vires act, contradicted principles\n\nof equity, and offended the Due Process Clause of the United States\n\nConstitution.\n\n           The district court entered summary judgment against all\n\nbut three of the plaintiffs.     The court then held a bench trial and\n\nresolved the remaining claims.       The plaintiffs appeal the summary\n\njudgment rulings.   We affirm.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           We briefly rehearse the relevant factual and procedural\n\nbackground, supplementing this bare-bones account in our subsequent\n\ndiscussion of particular issues.\n\n           The plaintiffs comprise thirty-three retired firefighters\n\nand police officers previously employed by Warwick, Rhode Island\n\n\n\n\n                                    -2-\n\f(the City).1      At various points over the past three decades, each\n\nof them sustained a debilitating injury in the line of duty,\n\nresulting in a grant of disability leave by the City's Board of\n\nPublic Safety (the Board).             When it became apparent that the\n\nplaintiffs' injuries precluded a return to active duty, the Board\n\nexercised its discretion to place them in retirement. See Warwick,\n\nR.I., Code of Ordinances §§ 20-112(a)(1), 20-202(a)(1), 52-38(a),\n\n52-76(a).      Each plaintiff received a disability pension that\n\nincluded defined medical benefits.\n\n            The    present   dispute    centers   on   the   extent   of   this\n\nbenefit.    In the first instance, the City funds the payment of\n\nretirees' medical expenses2 through health insurance, which covers\n\npart, but not all, of those costs.           For many years, the City also\n\nreimbursed excess medical expenses (i.e., expenses not covered by\n\ninsurance).    This meant that one hundred percent of each retiree's\n\nmedical expenses was reimbursed.\n\n            In 2003, the City took a fresh look at its past practice\n\nand concluded that, in accordance with a recent decision of the\n\nRhode Island Supreme Court, it was not obliged to reimburse all of\n\na disabled retiree's medical expenses.            Consequently, the City's\n\n\n     1\n       The underlying action was originally commenced by thirty-\nnine plaintiffs, but six have fallen by the wayside.\n     2\n       For purposes of this opinion, we limit the term \"medical\nexpenses\" to those expenses incurred to cure or relieve the effects\nof injuries arising out of a firefighter's or police officer's\nemployment.\n\n                                       -3-\n\fpersonnel director, Oscar Shelton, informed the plaintiffs, by\n\nletter dated December 11, 2003, that as of January 1, 2004, the\n\nCity would no longer reimburse medical expenses not covered by\n\ninsurance.    Because the letter directed disabled retirees instead\n\nto the health insurance provided as part of their pensions, it had\n\nthe additional effect of requiring that, upon reaching the age of\n\nsixty-five, disabled retirees would have to apply for Medicare.\n\n            Dismayed by this about-face, the plaintiffs asked for a\n\nhearing before the Board.    The Board responded that\n\n            [a]lthough [the] request can be placed on the\n            agenda, the Board's position is, pursuant to\n            the [Rhode Island] Supreme Court decision,\n            that any retiree who has written confirmation\n            that the City and/or Board of Public Safety\n            will pay 100% of [on-the-job injury] related\n            medical bills after retirement will have those\n            bills paid in full.    Otherwise, the Board's\n            position is that the City's health insurance,\n            as part of the retirement plan, meets the\n            City's obligation.\n\n            After unsuccessfully presenting their claims to the City\n\nCouncil, see R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-15-5, the plaintiffs brought suit\n\nin state court against the Board, the City, and a myriad of\n\nmunicipal    officials   (including    Shelton).   Their     complaint\n\nchallenged termination of the practice of fully reimbursing medical\n\nexpenses as violative of state statutory law, unauthorized, barred\n\nby principles of equitable estoppel, and offensive to due process.\n\nThe defendants removed the action to the federal district court.\n\nSee 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441.\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\f            In due season, the defendants sought summary judgment.\n\nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 56.      The district court initially granted the\n\nmotion on all claims. Cahoon v. Shelton (Cahoon I), No. 07-cv-008,\n\n2008 WL 64518, at *12 (D.R.I. Jan. 4, 2008).            On the plaintiffs'\n\nmotion for reconsideration, the court later vacated the judgment\n\nwith respect to the equitable estoppel claims.                See Cahoon v.\n\nShelton (Cahoon II), No. 07-cv-008, 2008 WL 6514326, at *1 (D.R.I.\n\nMar. 10, 2008).     After further discovery limited to the equitable\n\nestoppel issue, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the\n\ndefendants    on   the   estoppel   claims   of   all   but   three   of   the\n\nplaintiffs.    See Cahoon v. Shelton (Cahoon III), No. 07-cv-008,\n\n2009 WL 1758738, at *7 (D.R.I. June 18, 2009).\n\n            The three exempted plaintiffs (James Gordon, Michael\n\nKraczkowski, and Thomas Thompson) tried their estoppel claims to\n\nthe court, which found that the Board had explicitly promised to\n\nreimburse all of Gordon's and Kraczkowski's medical expenses but\n\nhad made no comparable promise to Thompson.         See Cahoon v. Shelton\n\n(Cahoon IV), No. 07-cv-008, 2010 WL 3385040, at *3-4 (D.R.I. Aug.\n\n26, 2010).    The court entered judgment accordingly.           Id. at *5.\n\nThe plaintiffs' timely appeal of the summary judgment rulings\n\nfollowed.    The defendants have not appealed the judgments in favor\n\nof Gordon and Kraczkowski on the bench-tried estoppel claims.              For\n\nhis part, Thompson has not appealed from the adverse findings in\n\n\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fthe bench trial (although he, like the plaintiffs generally,\n\ncontinues to press a global claim of estoppel).\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           In    this   venue,        the    plaintiffs      resurrect      the     same\n\nasseverational array that they presented in the court below. After\n\ndelineating the legal standards that govern our inquiry, we address\n\neach of the plaintiffs' four global asseverations. We then turn to\n\nthe individualized and conceptually distinct claims mounted by\n\nGordon and Kraczkowski.          Because the latter two claims stand on a\n\ndifferent conceptual footing, we hereafter use the term \"the\n\nplaintiffs\" to designate all the plaintiffs other than Gordon and\n\nKraczkowski.\n\n                            A.    Legal Standards.\n\n           Our    review    of    a    district       court's     entry   of   summary\n\njudgment is de novo.             Dávila v. Corporación de P.R. para la\n\nDifusión Pública, 498 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2007).                    We will affirm\n\nthe decision only if the record reveals no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and discloses that the moving party is entitled to\n\njudgment as a matter of law. Vineberg v. Bissonnette, 548 F.3d 50,\n\n55 (1st Cir. 2008).        In this endeavor, we are not married to the\n\ntrial   court's    reasoning          but,        rather,   may    affirm      on    any\n\nindependently sufficient ground made manifest by the record.\n\nHoulton Citizens' Coal. v. Town of Houlton, 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st\n\nCir. 1999).\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\f          When interpreting state law, a federal court employs the\n\nmethod and approach announced by the state's highest court.\n\nCarolina Trucks & Equip., Inc. v. Volvo Trucks of N. Am., Inc., 492\n\nF.3d 484, 489 (4th Cir. 2007); Nat'l Pharmacies, Inc. v. Feliciano-\n\nde-Melecio, 221 F.3d 235, 241-42 (1st Cir. 2000). The Rhode Island\n\nSupreme Court has made it pellucid that in interpreting state\n\nstatutes, a court's \"ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose\n\nof the act as intended by the Legislature.\"    Webster v. Perrotta,\n\n774 A.2d 68, 75 (R.I. 2001).   \"The best evidence of such intent can\n\nbe found in the plain language used in the statute.\"     Steinhof v.\n\nMurphy, 991 A.2d 1028, 1036 (R.I. 2010) (quoting State v. Germane,\n\n971 A.2d 555, 574 (R.I. 2009)).\n\n          Thus, when faced with statutory language that is clear\n\nand unambiguous, an inquiring court ordinarily must construe the\n\nstatute precisely as it is written, giving its constituent words\n\ntheir plain meanings.3   Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kaya, 947 A.2d\n\n869, 872 (R.I. 2008).    In performing that task, the court must\n\n\"consider the entire statute as a whole.\"         Ryan   v. City of\n\nProvidence, 11 A.3d 68, 71 (R.I. 2011).     Only if the legislature\n\nhas sounded an uncertain trumpet should a court resort to canons of\n\n\n\n\n     3\n       We say \"ordinarily\" because, plain language notwithstanding,\na statute should never be construed in a way that produces an\nabsurd result. Ryan v. City of Providence, 11 A.3d 68, 71 (R.I.\n2011).\n\n                                  -7-\n\fstatutory construction.     Harvard Pilgrim Health Care of New Engl.,\n\nInc. v. Rossi, 847 A.2d 286, 290 (R.I. 2004) (per curiam).\n\n                       B.     The IOD Statute.\n\n          The   plaintiffs'    principal   argument    hinges   on   state\n\nstatutes, municipal ordinances, and the interplay among them.         The\n\ntouchstone of this argument is the injured-on-duty (IOD) statute,\n\nwhich reads in relevant part:\n\n          Whenever . . . any police officer [or] fire\n          fighter . . . of any city . . . is wholly or\n          partially incapacitated by reason of injuries\n          received . . . in the performance of his or\n          her duties . . ., the respective city . . . by\n          which the police officer [or] fire fighter\n          . . . is employed, shall, during the period of\n          the incapacity, pay the police officer [or]\n          fire fighter . . . the salary or wage and\n          benefits to which the police officer [or] fire\n          fighter . . . would be entitled had he or she\n          not been incapacitated, and shall pay the\n          medical [expenses] for the necessary period\n          . . . . In addition, the cities . . . shall\n          pay all similar expenses incurred by a member\n          who has been placed on a disability pension\n          and suffers a recurrence of the injury or\n          illness that dictated his or her disability\n          retirement.\n\nR.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-1(a).\n\n          The IOD statute comprises two sentences.         The district\n\ncourt concluded that neither sentence was sufficient to carry the\n\nburden of the plaintiffs' statutory argument.         The court reasoned\n\nthat the first sentence (Sentence 1) did not apply because, as\n\nretirees, the plaintiffs were no longer employed by the City.\n\nCahoon I, 2008 WL 64518, at *4-5.    It concluded that application of\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fthe second sentence (Sentence 2) was sidetracked by the combined\n\neffect   of    R.I.    Gen.   Laws    §   43-3-26     and   Warwick's   municipal\n\nordinances.        Id. at *5-8.      Consequently, the court held that the\n\nplaintiffs were not, as a statutory matter, entitled to full\n\nreimbursement of medical expenses.              Id. at *8.\n\n              The plaintiffs argue that the district court erred; that\n\nSentence 1 entitles them, even after their retirement, to full\n\nreimbursement         of   medical     expenses;      and    that    Sentence    2\n\nindependently produces the same result.\n\n              We start with Sentence 1.          The plaintiffs maintain that\n\nthis sentence confers benefits not only during the course of\n\nemployment but also during retirement. In their view, the language\n\nof Sentence 1 is ambiguous, and the district court's interpretation\n\nfails to effectuate the intent of the state legislature (the Rhode\n\nIsland General Assembly).          We find this argument unpersuasive.\n\n              The language of section 45-19-1(a) is clear as a bell.\n\nThe section creates two tiers of benefits: the first, codified in\n\nSentence      1,   applies    to   persons      who   are   still   employed    but\n\ntemporarily disabled; the second, codified in Sentence 2, applies\n\nto persons who are retired due to a disability.               The instruction in\n\nSentence 1 to pay \"during the period of the incapacity\" the \"salary\n\nor wage\" to which the injured worker \"would be entitled had he or\n\nshe   not     been    incapacitated\"       unequivocally     denotes    a   person\n\npresently employed. After all, a retiree, by definition, no longer\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fdraws a salary or wages.   Rather, as Sentence 2 makes manifest, a\n\nretiree is \"placed on a . . . pension.\"      Equally telling is the\n\nlegislature's use of the present tense (\"is employed\") in Sentence\n\n1.\n\n          This reading is reinforced by the statutory description\n\nof the benefit period as a \"period of the incapacity.\"         That\n\ndescription plainly envisions that benefits under Sentence 1 are\n\nmeant to apply for a limited time.    By contrast, Sentence 2 speaks\n\nof \"retirement\" — an unlimited time. The contrary reading urged by\n\nthe plaintiffs would obliterate this line of demarcation.\n\n          If more were needed — and we do not think that it is —\n\nfully reimbursing the medical expenses of disabled retirees under\n\nSentence 1 would make Sentence 2 entirely superfluous.       Courts\n\nshould avoid construing a statute in a way that will divest any of\n\nits component parts of meaning.      See, e.g., State v. Clark, 974\n\nA.2d 558, 572 (R.I. 2009); Brennan v. Kirby, 529 A.2d 633, 637\n\n(R.I. 1987).   There is every reason to honor that precept here.\n\n          Our reading of section 45-19-1(a) is wholly consistent\n\nwith the case law.   The state's highest court has determined that\n\nthe language of the IOD statute is clear and unambiguous.       See\n\nBrissette v. Potter, 560 A.2d 324, 325 (R.I. 1989); Aiudi v. Pepin,\n\n417 A.2d 320, 321 (R.I. 1980).    In addition, our parsing of the\n\nstatute's two sentences conforms with that court's precedents.\n\nSee, e.g., Webster, 774 A.2d at 80 (concluding that the benefits\n\n\n                               -10-\n\fcontemplated by Sentence 1 apply to a firefighter or police officer\n\nonly \"while he or she remains a member of the department\" (emphasis\n\nin original)); Brissette, 560 A.2d at 326 (stating that the \"first\n\nportion of the statute . . . relates specifically to salary\" while\n\nthe second clause \"relates to medical expenses for a member who has\n\nbeen placed on a disability pension\").\n\n          The recent case of Hagenberg v. Avedisian, 879 A.2d 436\n\n(R.I. 2005) mirrors the circumstances with which we are confronted.\n\nThere, a retired Warwick police officer sought full reimbursement\n\nof medical expenses under the IOD statute.           Id. at 438-39.        The\n\ncourt held that Sentence 1 did not compel such reimbursement for an\n\nofficer who had retired on a disability pension.               Id. at 441-42\n\n(explaining   that   \"[t]he   IOD    statute     never   was    intended   to\n\nsupplement a retired officer's retirement benefits\"). As the court\n\nhad explained in an earlier case, \"[u]pon acceptance of disability\n\npension benefits,\" a plaintiff \"may not . . . seek additional\n\nbenefits pursuant to § 45-19-1.\"           Elliott v. Town of Warren, 818\n\nA.2d 652, 655 (R.I. 2003) (per curiam).             Here, the plaintiffs\n\navailed themselves of the City's retirement benefits regime and\n\nthey cannot now resort to the prophylaxis of section 45-19-1.\n\n          In an effort to lessen the impact of these precedents,\n\nthe plaintiffs insist that the General Assembly, by enacting\n\nsection 45-19-1, intended to give disabled firefighters and police\n\nofficers greater benefits than those available under traditional\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fworkers' compensation laws.     This insistence puts the matter in a\n\nfalse light.    It was only through Sentence 1, which ensures the\n\npayment of full salary and medical benefits during the period of\n\ntemporary incapacity, that the General Assembly intended to exceed\n\nthe generosity of the workers' compensation laws.      See Labbadia v.\n\nState, 513 A.2d 18, 21 (R.I. 1986) (describing the advantages of\n\nthe IOD statute vis-à-vis the workers' compensation laws). Nothing\n\nin the text of section 45-19-1 suggests that the legislature's\n\npurpose was to give injured firefighters and police officers better\n\nretirement benefits.     See Hagenberg, 879 A.2d at 441.\n\n           This brings us to Sentence 2, which states that the City\n\n\"shall pay all similar expenses incurred by a member who has been\n\nplaced on a disability pension.\"     The plaintiffs' position is that\n\nthis language cinches their entitlement to full reimbursement of\n\nmedical expenses post-retirement.       The language of Sentence 2, if\n\nread in a vacuum, gives this position a certain superficial allure.\n\nBut a court cannot — and must not — read a statute in a vacuum, and\n\nSentence 2 runs headlong into R.I. Gen. Laws § 43-3-26, which\n\ndirects that, in cases of irreconcilable conflict between two\n\nlegislative provisions, one general and the other specific, the\n\nlatter \"shall prevail and shall be construed as an exception to the\n\ngeneral provision.\"\n\n           The specific provision applicable here is R.I. Gen. Laws\n\n§   45-19-19,   which   authorizes   municipalities   to   \"provide,   by\n\n\n                                 -12-\n\fordinance or through collective bargaining, for the retirement of\n\nthe personnel of their police and fire departments who have been on\n\nleave of absence from their employment due to . . . injuries\n\nsustained in the performance of their duties.\"             Because Warwick\n\nprovides retirement medical benefits to its disabled firefighters\n\nand police officers through a combination of city ordinances and\n\ncollective bargaining agreements (CBAs),4 the court below held that\n\nthis specific arrangement took precedence over the more general\n\nprovision   contained   in    Sentence   2   and,   therefore,   that   the\n\nplaintiffs were not entitled to full medical benefits under section\n\n45-19-1(a).    Cahoon I, 2008 WL 64518, at *8.            This holding is\n\nmanifestly correct.\n\n            We need not tarry.    Sentence 2 is a general provision.\n\nIt conflicts with the combination of R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-19 and\n\nthe City's actions in pursuance thereof.            For present purposes,\n\nthis conflict renders Sentence 2 inapposite.            See St. Germain v.\n\nCity of Pawtucket, 382 A.2d 180, 181 (R.I. 1978) (per curiam)\n\n(concluding   that   city's    retirement    benefits    law   for   injured\n\nfirefighters was specific compared to section 45-19-1, where former\n\n\n\n\n     4\n       Warwick firefighters and police officers are afforded\npensions and health insurance coverage, regardless of whether or\nnot retirement is due to a disability. See Warwick, R.I., Code of\nOrdinances §§ 20-101, 20-161, 52-36, 52-76 (pensions); id. §§ 20-\n60, 52-6 (health insurance). The CBAs between the City and the\npublic safety unions echo these arrangements.\n\n                                  -13-\n\fwas \"applicable only to the city,\" while latter was \"a general\n\nstatute which applies to all cities and towns\").\n\n           The plaintiffs proclaim that there is no conflict between\n\nsection 45-19-1 and the City's retirement scheme. But the conflict\n\nis obvious.   Warwick's ordinances provide disabled retirees with\n\nhealth insurance, see Warwick, R.I., Code of Ordinances §§ 20-\n\n60(a), 52-6(a), and this insurance covers some (but not all)\n\nmedical expenses, leaving the retirees responsible for the balance.\n\nFurthermore, the insurance coverage attaches only until Medicare\n\ncan be expected to bear the load.   Id. §§ 20-60(c), 52-6(b).   This\n\nscheme directly and ineluctably conflicts with the second sentence\n\nof section 45-19-1(a), which requires the full payment of any\n\nmedical expenses — and does so without any Medicare hand-off.    See\n\nMorry v. City of Warwick, 742 A.2d 1205, 1207 (R.I. 2000) (per\n\ncuriam).\n\n           The significance of this conflict is made clear by the\n\ndecision in St. Germain, which explains that the General Assembly\n\ndesigned section 45-19-1 to protect only those firefighters and\n\npolice officers who are employed by \"cities . . . that do not have\n\ntheir own pension plans.\"   382 A.2d at 181.\n\n           The statute \"in no way repeals or supersedes\" the various\n\nspecial acts that authorize municipalities to establish their own\n\npension and retirement benefit plans. Id.; see Trembley v. City of\n\nCentral Falls, 480 A.2d 1359, 1362 (R.I. 1984).      Thus, where a\n\n\n                                -14-\n\fpension system that includes medical benefits is in effect, \"§ 45-\n\n19-1 may not serve as a default source of benefits.\"       Elliott, 818\n\nA.2d at 655; see Hagenberg, 879 A.2d at 442 (\"An injured officer\n\nemployed by a municipality that has its own retirement system is\n\nrestricted to the benefits provided by the particular statutory\n\nscheme.\").\n\n          The plaintiffs mount two additional counter-arguments.\n\nFirst, they contend that the grant of health insurance coverage to\n\nretired firefighters and police officers is effectuated not by\n\nsection   45-19-19,     but   by    section   45-2-11,     which   gives\n\nmunicipalities authority to provide healthcare coverage for all\n\nemployees.   This latter statute, they say, is another general\n\nstatute, thus eliminating the perceived conflict.        This contention\n\nis unavailing.\n\n          The ordinances that grant the City authority to provide\n\nhealth insurance coverage for its retired public safety personnel\n\nenumerate not only section 45-2-11, but also \"every other power\n\nthereunto enabling.\"    Warwick, R.I. Code of Ordinances § 20-60(a);\n\nsee id. § 52-6(a).     This language plainly encompasses section 45-\n\n19-19, which addresses the narrower subset of retired firefighters\n\nand police officers.\n\n          In all events, whether or not a conflict exists between\n\nsections 45-19-1 and 45-2-11, there is an undeniable conflict\n\nbetween both of those general provisions and the specific provision\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\fof section 45-19-19.     So long as that is true, section 45-2-11\n\ncannot come to the plaintiffs' rescue.\n\n           Alternatively,      the   plaintiffs    labor   to   refute   the\n\nconclusion that section 45-19-1 should not be read to permit, in\n\neffect, a bifurcation of benefits (some governed by state statutes\n\nand others governed by municipal ordinances).          See Cahoon I, 2008\n\nWL 64518, at *6.   But the state supreme court's decision in Elliott\n\nstands squarely in their path.              See Elliott, 818 A.2d at 654\n\n(rejecting any \"entitlement to a bifurcation of pension and medical\n\nbenefits when . . . a disability pension system is in place\").\n\n           While the plaintiffs strive to distinguish Elliott on the\n\nground that the claimant in that case was seeking both salary and\n\nmedical expense reimbursements, id. at 653, there is no reason to\n\nbelieve that the General Assembly intended a claim for one kind of\n\nretirement benefits under section 45-19-1 to be treated differently\n\nfrom a claim for some other kind of retirement benefits.            Indeed,\n\nthe case law suggests the opposite conclusion.         See Hagenberg, 879\n\nA.2d at 441-42; see also Lanni v. Ferrante, 688 A.2d 865, 866 (R.I.\n\n1997)   (mem.)   (concluding    that   \"plaintiff,    having    voluntarily\n\nelected to recover his disability pension benefits from [the\n\nmunicipal pension] system . . . may not . . . seek benefits\n\npursuant to § 45-19-1\"); cf. United States v. O'Neil, 11 F.3d 292,\n\n296 (1st Cir. 1993) (noting venerable principle that grant of a\n\ngreater power includes grant of a lesser power).\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f             The short of it is that Sentence 2 functions as a gap-\n\nfilling mechanism, assuring injured retirees that municipalities\n\nwill not leave them completely high and dry with regard to medical\n\nexpenses.5     If, however, a municipality provides medical coverage\n\nfor retirees, there is no gap to fill and, thus, no room for\n\nsection 45-19-1 to furnish default benefits.            See Hagenberg, 879\n\nA.2d at 442.      That the benefit separately provided is less than one\n\nhundred percent of medical expenses does not alter this reality.\n\nSee, e.g., Elliott, 818 A.2d at 655.\n\n             Here, the City has created a retirement system that\n\ncovers   its      public   safety   retirees   and   affords   them   medical\n\nbenefits.      It is this system, not Sentence 2, that dictates the\n\nmedical benefits available to the plaintiffs.\n\n             In a last-ditch effort to carry the day, the plaintiffs\n\nassert that the City's retirement plan incorporates the benefits\n\ndue to retirees under section 45-19-1. This assertion lacks force.\n\n             To   be   sure,   some municipalities     maintain   retirement\n\nsystems which, either through legislative acts or CBAs, incorporate\n\nthe provisions of the IOD statute and provide that retirement\n\n\n\n     5\n        The plaintiffs suggest that Sentence 2, rather than\nfunctioning as a gap-filler, was a legislative response to the\ndecision in Santanelli v. City of Providence, 250 A.2d 849 (R.I.\n1969).   However, the amendment of the IOD statute to include\nSentence 2 occurred a full six years after Santanelli was decided.\nThe alleged cause-and-effect relationship is pure conjecture and,\nin any event, Sentence 2's language is inhospitable to the\nsuggestion.\n\n                                     -17-\n\fbenefits for disabled public safety officers should be distributed\n\naccordingly.      See, e.g., Brissette, 560 A.2d at 325.             Warwick,\n\nhowever,   is    not   among    that    number.    Nothing   in   the   City's\n\nordinances or CBAs indicates an intent to integrate the terms of\n\nsection 45-19-1 into the City's retirement system.            There would be\n\nno justification in straining to reach such a result by judicial\n\nfiat.\n\n           Hagenberg confirms this understanding.            The court there\n\nexplicitly stated that an officer who \"retires with a disability\n\npension . . . forfeits the benefits of § 45-19-1, unless the\n\nmunicipality has no disability pension system.\"            879 A.2d at 442.\n\nThe court's statement that the component of the City's retirement\n\nsystem that paid medical benefits was \"in accordance with the IOD\n\nstatute,\" id. at 443, signifies only that the City maintained a\n\ndisability      retirement     system    that   provided   medical   benefits\n\nsufficient to obviate any need to resort to default benefits under\n\nsection 45-19-1. Thus, we conclude that the plaintiffs' claims for\n\nfull reimbursement of medical expenses by operation of the IOD\n\nstatute, whether seen in terms of Sentence 1 or Sentence 2, are\n\nwithout merit.\n\n                               C.   Ultra Vires.\n\n           When the City came to the belated realization that its\n\npractice of fully reimbursing disabled retirees' medical expenses\n\nwas gratuitous, its personnel director (Shelton) put a stop to it.\n\n\n                                        -18-\n\fThe plaintiffs contend that the decision as to whether to halt the\n\npractice was the Board's prerogative and that, therefore, Shelton's\n\nunilateral action was ultra vires.6\n\n            The plaintiffs' contention puts the cart before the\n\nhorse. Warwick's ordinances explicitly provide that the Board \"has\n\nthe responsibility for approving all applications for retirement,\n\ndeath, termination, and disability benefits.\"        Warwick, R.I., Code\n\nof Ordinances §§ 20-137, 20-262; see id. §§ 52-36, 52-39, 52-76,\n\n52-77, 52-80.    Hence, the Board is the only entity in the City that\n\nhas the authority to authorize full reimbursement of medical\n\nexpenses.      This is crucial because the record is barren of any\n\nevidence that the Board ever authorized the full reimbursement\n\npractice on a global basis.\n\n            Without    such   an   authorization   from    the   Board,   the\n\npayments made by the City to reimburse medical expenses were\n\nthemselves ultra vires.        It follows inexorably that no special\n\nauthorization was needed to halt them. After all, when a party has\n\nno lawful right to receive payments from the public fisc, halting\n\nthe   stream    of    unauthorized   payments   requires    no   particular\n\n\n      6\n       To the extent that the plaintiffs challenge the propriety of\nsummary judgment because the record is silent as to whether the\nBoard approved full reimbursement of medical expenses globally,\nthat challenge is bootless. A party who bears the burden of proof\non an issue cannot defeat summary judgment by relying on\nspeculation about the facts. Ahern v. Shinseki, 629 F.3d 49, 54\n(1st Cir. 2010).    Such a party must offer \"definite, competent\nevidence to rebut the motion.\" Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co., 950 F.2d\n816, 822 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n                                     -19-\n\fformality.    See Town of Johnston v. Pezza, 723 A.2d 278, 283 (R.I.\n\n1999).7      Absent   some   equitable    barrier   to   the   cessation   of\n\nunauthorized payments (a matter to which we shortly shall return),\n\na municipality is allowed to correct an ultra vires practice\n\nregardless of which municipal officer brings it to a halt.          See id.\n\nat 284; Almeida v. Zoning Bd. of Review of Tiverton, 606 A.2d 1318,\n\n1321 (R.I. 1992); see also Pub. Serv. Co. of N.H. v. Town of West\n\nNewbury, 835 F.2d 380, 383 (1st Cir. 1987) (discerning no authority\n\nfor the proposition that a municipality cannot \"nullif[y] an action\n\ninvalid from the beginning\").\n\n                        D.    Equitable Estoppel.\n\n          The plaintiffs next invoke the equitable exception to the\n\nhalting of an ultra vires practice, positing that the City's\n\nprolonged reimbursement of medical expenses estops it from changing\n\ncourse at this late date.      The district court rejected this global\n\ntheory, Cahoon III, 2009 WL 1758738, at *7, even though it found\n\nthat specific estoppel-creating promises had been made to Gordon\n\nand Kraczkowski, Cahoon IV, 2010 WL 3385040, at *4-5.\n\n          To succeed on an equitable estoppel claim, a party must\n\nestablish that the defendant made \"an affirmative representation\n\n\n     7\n       The plaintiffs insist that Pezza is off-point because the\nperson terminating the unlawfully issued building permit had\nauthority to rescind permits not in compliance with the town's\nzoning requirements.     But this is a distinction without a\ndifference. What matters is that the initial act was unauthorized\nand, therefore, a nullity. See Town of Charlestown v. Beattie, 422\nA.2d 1250, 1252 (R.I. 1980).\n\n                                   -20-\n\f. . . directed to [him] for the purpose of inducing [him] to act or\n\nfail to act in reliance thereon,\" and that such representation \"did\n\ninduce [him] to act or fail to act to his injury.\"   Prov. Teachers\n\nUnion v. Prov. Sch. Bd., 689 A.2d 388, 391-92 (R.I. 1997) (quoting\n\nLichtenstein v. Parness, 99 A.2d 3, 5 (R.I. 1953)); accord Saccucci\n\nAuto Grp., Inc. v. Am. Honda Motor Co., 617 F.3d 14, 27 (1st Cir.\n\n2010) (applying Rhode Island law).    With respect to a governmental\n\nentity, estoppel \"must be predicated upon the acts or conduct of\n\n[the public entity's] officers, agents or official bodies acting\n\nwithin the scope of their authority.\" Potter v. Crawford, 797 A.2d\n\n489, 492 (R.I. 2002) (per curiam) (internal quotation omitted).\n\nMeasured against these benchmarks, the plaintiffs' estoppel claims\n\nare triply flawed.\n\n          The first flaw is the absence of any evidence that the\n\nBoard made either a promise or an affirmative representation to\n\ndisabled firefighters and police officers generally that the City\n\nwould fully reimburse disabled retirees' medical expenses.      For\n\naught that appears from the record, the Board was not consulted.\n\nIn the absence of such evidence, the district court appropriately\n\ngranted summary judgment on the equitable estoppel claims.      See\n\nRet. Bd. of Emps.' Ret. Sys. v. DiPrete, 845 A.2d 270, 284 (R.I.\n\n2004).\n\n          The second flaw is equally destructive to the fabric of\n\nthe plaintiffs' argument.   \"[T]he doctrine of equitable estoppel\n\n\n                               -21-\n\fshould not be applied against a governmental entity . . . when, as\n\nhere, the alleged representations or conduct relied upon were ultra\n\nvires.\"   Romano v. Ret. Bd. of Emps.' Ret. Sys., 767 A.2d 35, 38\n\n(R.I. 2001).   Because the City's full reimbursement of medical\n\nexpenses was ultra vires, see supra Part II(C), the claims for\n\nequitable estoppel founder.    See, e.g., Tech. Investors v. Town of\n\nWesterly, 689 A.2d 1060, 1062 (R.I. 1997).\n\n          Third, and finally, the Rhode Island Supreme Court has\n\nnoted that \"[t]he key element of an estoppel is intentionally\n\ninduced   prejudicial   reliance.\"      El    Marocco   Club,   Inc.   v.\n\nRichardson, 746 A.2d 1228, 1234 (R.I. 2000) (quoting E. Greenwich\n\nYacht Club v. Coastal Res. Mgmt. Council, 376 A.2d 682, 686 (R.I.\n\n1977)).   The plaintiffs have proffered nothing to show that the\n\nCity intentionally induced reliance on a continuation of full\n\nreimbursement (indeed, they have not even identified a reason why\n\nthe City might have wanted to induce such reliance).        The lack of\n\nany such proof is, in itself, a sufficient basis for summary\n\njudgment on these claims.      See Leiter v. Allstate Ins. Co., 725\n\nA.2d 882, 883-84 (R.I. 1999) (per curiam).\n\n                          E.   Due Process.\n\n          The plaintiffs' last remonstrance charges that Shelton's\n\ntermination of the past practice without a hearing took their\n\nproperty without due process of law.         This remonstrance need not\n\noccupy us for long.\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\f           It   is    apodictic     that       the    Constitution     \"imposes\n\nconstraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of\n\n. . . 'property' interests within the meaning of the Due Process\n\nClause.\"   Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976).               A court\n\ntasked   with   determining     whether    a    constitutionally      protected\n\nproperty   interest    exists     must     look      to   \"existing   rules   or\n\nunderstandings that stem from an independent source such as state\n\nlaw.\"    Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 577\n\n(1972). A party's unilateral expectation, in itself, cannot create\n\na constitutionally protected property interest.                Webb's Fabulous\n\nPharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, 449 U.S. 155, 161 (1980); Young v.\n\nWall, 642 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir. 2011).\n\n           The plaintiffs have not identified any source that would\n\ngive rise to a constitutionally protected property interest in the\n\ncontinuation of full reimbursement.               For example, there is no\n\nstatutory requirement that the City reimburse retired firefighters\n\nand police officers for medical expenses beyond what is already\n\nprovided through the retirement system. See supra Part II(B). Nor\n\nhave the plaintiffs shown a property interest forged through the\n\noperation of equitable principles. See supra Part II(D). While we\n\ndo not question the sincerity of the plaintiffs' desire to continue\n\nreceiving full reimbursement, such a desire, unanchored in a state\n\nlaw or rule, is not enough to ground a procedural due process\n\n\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fclaim.8   See, e.g., Young, 642 F.3d at 55; Centro Medico del\n\nTurabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio, 406 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.\n\n2005).\n\n                     F.   Gordon and Kraczkowski.\n\n          As we already have explained, Gordon and Kraczkowski\n\nprevailed at a bench trial on their estoppel claims because the\n\nBoard had made specific commitments to them.        Consequently, they\n\ncontinue to receive full reimbursement of medical expenses.\n\nNevertheless, they contend that judgment should not have been\n\nentered against them on their ultra vires and procedural due\n\nprocess claims.\n\n          Gordon and Kraczkowski have not explained what other or\n\nfurther relief they might be entitled to receive on these theories.\n\nThey simply assert, without elaboration and in conclusory fashion,\n\nan entitlement to relief.    We long have held that claims asserted\n\nin a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by developed argumentation,\n\nare deemed abandoned.     United States v. Zannino, 895 F.2d 1, 17\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).    So it is here.\n\n          Another   infirmity   is   apparent.   The   district   court\n\ngranted summary judgment on the ultra vires and procedural due\n\nprocess claims, see Cahoon I, 2008 WL 64518, at *9-11, before\n\n\n     8\n       The plaintiffs make a feeble attempt to argue that the\ntermination of full reimbursement deprived them of substantive due\nprocess. This argument appears for the first time in their reply\nbrief. It is, therefore, waived. See Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp.,\n904 F.2d 83, 86 (1st Cir. 1990).\n\n                                 -24-\n\fGordon and Kraczkowski, in a later bench trial, established the\n\nexistence of specific promises of full reimbursement, see Cahoon\n\nIV, 2010 WL 3385040, at *5. This changed factual finding presented\n\nan avenue by which Gordon and Kraczkowski could, and should, have\n\nsought the additional relief they desired.         See In re Sun Pipe Line\n\nCo., 831 F.2d 22, 24 (1st Cir. 1987).             But neither Gordon nor\n\nKraczkowski ever asked the district court to modify its earlier\n\njudgment on the ultra vires and due process claims in light of\n\nCahoon IV.     See Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e); In re Sun Pipe Line, 831\n\nF.2d at 24 (explaining that a motion asking \"the court to modify\n\nits earlier disposition of a case because of an allegedly erroneous\n\nlegal result is brought under Fed. R. Civ. P. 59(e)\").\n\n           \"[I]t is black letter law that it is a party's first\n\nobligation to seek any relief that might fairly have been thought\n\navailable in the district court before seeking it on appeal.\"\n\nBeaulieu v. IRS, 865 F.2d 1351, 1352 (1st Cir. 1989).            Gordon and\n\nKraczkowski flouted this obligation.           Given the circumstances of\n\nthis   case,   we   see   no   reason   to   consider   their   request   for\n\nadditional (unspecified) relief as a matter of first impression.\n\nSee, e.g., Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth Coll., 889 F.2d 13, 22 n.9\n\n(1st Cir. 1989).\n\nIII.   CONCLUSION\n\n           To sum up, government officials have a solemn duty to\n\nexpend public funds in accordance with law. Although we understand\n\n\n                                    -25-\n\fthe plaintiffs' frustration — after all, the City buoyed their\n\nhopes when it mistakenly plunged ahead, over a period of years, to\n\nmake full reimbursement of disabled public safety retirees' medical\n\nexpenses — they have not, as a class, shown any basis in law or in\n\nequity sufficient to force the City to perpetuate this erroneous\n\npractice.    Taxpayers, too, have rights.\n\n            We   do,   however,   make   an   exception   for   Gordon   and\n\nKraczkowski.     Each of them has succeeded in making out a claimant-\n\nspecific case for estoppel.        They have earned the right to the\n\nrelief that the district court ordered.\n\n            We need go no further.

In this case, a municipality became convinced that former firefighters and police officers who had retired on disability pensions were collecting a particular benefit (full reimbursement of certain medical expenses) without legal warrant. The municipality acted on this conviction and stopped paying the tab. A group of affected retirees sued to enforce continued payment, alleging that the municipality's about-face violated state statutes, constituted an ultra vires act, contradicted principles of equity, and offended the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p>The district court entered summary judgment against all but three of the plaintiffs. The court then held a bench trial and resolved the remaining claims. The plaintiffs appeal the summary judgment rulings. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We briefly rehearse the relevant factual and procedural background, supplementing this bare-bones account in our subsequent discussion of particular issues.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs comprise thirty-three retired firefighters and police officers previously employed by Warwick, Rhode Island (the City).<sup>[1]</sup> At various points over the past three decades, each of them sustained a debilitating injury in the line of duty, resulting in a grant of disability leave by the City's Board of Public Safety (the Board). When it became apparent that the plaintiffs' injuries precluded a return to active duty, the Board exercised its discretion to place them in retirement. <i>See</i> Warwick, R.I., Code of Ordinances §§ 20-112(a)(1), 20-202(a)(1), 52-38(a), 52-76(a). Each plaintiff received a disability pension that included defined medical benefits.</p>\n<p>The present dispute centers on the extent of this benefit. In the first instance, the City funds the payment of retirees' medical expenses<sup>[2]</sup> through health insurance, which covers part, but not all, of those costs. For many years, the City also reimbursed excess medical expenses (i.e., expenses not covered by insurance). This meant that one hundred percent of each retiree's medical expenses was reimbursed.</p>\n<p>In 2003, the City took a fresh look at its past practice and concluded that, in accordance with a recent decision of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, it was not obliged to reimburse all of a disabled retiree's medical expenses. Consequently, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> City's personnel director, Oscar Shelton, informed the plaintiffs, by letter dated December 11, 2003, that as of January 1, 2004, the City would no longer reimburse medical expenses not covered by insurance. Because the letter directed disabled retirees instead to the health insurance provided as part of their pensions, it had the additional effect of requiring that, upon reaching the age of sixty-five, disabled retirees would have to apply for Medicare.</p>\n<p>Dismayed by this about-face, the plaintiffs asked for a hearing before the Board. The Board responded that</p>\n<blockquote>[a]lthough [the] request can be placed on the agenda, the Board's position is, pursuant to the [Rhode Island] Supreme Court decision, that any retiree who has written confirmation that the City and/or Board of Public Safety will pay 100% of [on-the-job injury] related medical bills after retirement will have those bills paid in full. Otherwise, the Board's position is that the City's health insurance, as part of the retirement plan, meets the City's obligation.</blockquote>\n<p>After unsuccessfully presenting their claims to the City Council, <i>see</i> R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-15-5, the plaintiffs brought suit in state court against the Board, the City, and a myriad of municipal officials (including Shelton). Their complaint challenged termination of the practice of fully reimbursing medical expenses as violative of state statutory law, unauthorized, barred by principles of equitable estoppel, and offensive to due process. The defendants removed the action to the federal district court. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441.</p>\n<p>In due season, the defendants sought summary judgment. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. The district court initially granted the motion on all claims. <i>Cahoon v. Shelton</i> (<i>Cahoon I</i>), No. 07-008, 2008 WL 64518, at *12 (D.R.I. Jan. 4, 2008). On the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, the court later vacated the judgment with respect to the equitable estoppel claims. <i>See Cahoon v. Shelton</i> (<i>Cahoon II</i>), No. 07-008, 2008 WL 6514326, at *1 (D.R.I. Mar. 10, 2008). After further discovery limited to the equitable estoppel issue, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the estoppel claims of all but three of the plaintiffs. <i>See Cahoon v. Shelton</i> (<i>Cahoon III</i>), No. 07-008, 2009 WL 1758738, at *7 (D.R.I. June 18, 2009).</p>\n<p>The three exempted plaintiffs (James Gordon, Michael Kraczkowski, and Thomas Thompson) tried their estoppel claims to the court, which found that the Board had explicitly promised to reimburse all of Gordon's and Kraczkowski's medical expenses but had made no comparable promise to Thompson. <i>See Cahoon v. Shelton</i> (<i>Cahoon IV</i>), No. 07-008, 2010 WL 3385040, at *3-4 (D.R.I. Aug. 26, 2010). The court entered judgment accordingly. <i>Id.</i> at *5. The plaintiffs' timely appeal of the summary judgment rulings followed. The defendants have not appealed the judgments in favor of Gordon and Kraczkowski on the bench-tried estoppel claims. For his part, Thompson has not appealed from the adverse findings in the bench trial (although he, like the plaintiffs generally, continues to press a global claim of estoppel).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>In this venue, the plaintiffs resurrect the same asseverational array that they presented in the court below. After delineating the legal standards that govern our inquiry, we address each of the plaintiffs' four global asseverations. We then turn to the individualized and conceptually distinct claims mounted by Gordon and Kraczkowski. Because the latter two claims stand on a different conceptual footing, we hereafter use the term \"the plaintiffs\" to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> designate all the plaintiffs other than Gordon and Kraczkowski.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Legal Standards.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Our review of a district court's entry of summary judgment is de novo. <i>Dávila v. Corporación de P.R. para la Difusión Pública,</i> 498 F.3d 9, 12 (1st Cir. 2007). We will affirm the decision only if the record reveals no genuine issue as to any material fact and discloses that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>Vineberg v. Bissonnette,</i> 548 F.3d 50, 55 (1st Cir.2008). In this endeavor, we are not married to the trial court's reasoning but, rather, may affirm on any independently sufficient ground made manifest by the record. <i>Houlton Citizens' Coal. v. Town of Houlton,</i> 175 F.3d 178, 184 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n<p>When interpreting state law, a federal court employs the method and approach announced by the state's highest court. <i>Carolina Trucks &amp; Equip., Inc. v. Volvo Trucks of N. Am., Inc.,</i> 492 F.3d 484, 489 (4th Cir.2007); <i>Nat'l Pharmacies, Inc. v. Feliciano-de-Melecio,</i> 221 F.3d 235, 241-42 (1st Cir.2000). The Rhode Island Supreme Court has made it pellucid that in interpreting state statutes, a court's \"ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act as intended by the Legislature.\" <i>Webster v. Perrotta,</i> 774 A.2d 68, 75 (R.I.2001). \"The best evidence of such intent can be found in the plain language used in the statute.\" <i>Steinhof v. Murphy,</i> 991 A.2d 1028, 1036 (R.I.2010) (quoting <i>State v. Germane,</i> 971 A.2d 555, 574 (R.I. 2009)).</p>\n<p>Thus, when faced with statutory language that is clear and unambiguous, an inquiring court ordinarily must construe the statute precisely as it is written, giving its constituent words their plain meanings.<sup>[3]</sup><i>Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. Kaya,</i> 947 A.2d 869, 872 (R.I.2008). In performing that task, the court must \"consider the entire statute as a whole.\" <i>Ryan v. City of Providence,</i> 11 A.3d 68, 71 (R.I.2011). Only if the legislature has sounded an uncertain trumpet should a court resort to canons of statutory construction. <i>Harvard Pilgrim Health Care of New Engl., Inc. v. Rossi,</i> 847 A.2d 286, 290 (R.I.2004) (per curiam).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. <i>The IOD Statute.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs' principal argument hinges on state statutes, municipal ordinances, and the interplay among them. The touchstone of this argument is the injured-on-duty (IOD) statute, which reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>Whenever ... any police officer [or] fire fighter ... of any city ... is wholly or partially incapacitated by reason of injuries received ... in the performance of his or her duties ..., the respective city... by which the police officer [or] fire fighter ... is employed, shall, during the period of the incapacity, pay the police officer [or] fire fighter ... the salary or wage and benefits to which the police officer [or] fire fighter ... would be entitled had he or she not been incapacitated, and shall pay the medical [expenses] for the necessary period.... In addition, the cities ... shall pay all similar expenses incurred by a member who has been placed on a disability pension and suffers a recurrence of the injury or illness that dictated his or her disability retirement.</blockquote>\n<p>R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-1(a).</p>\n<p>The IOD statute comprises two sentences. The district court concluded that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> neither sentence was sufficient to carry the burden of the plaintiffs' statutory argument. The court reasoned that the first sentence (Sentence 1) did not apply because, as retirees, the plaintiffs were no longer employed by the City. <i>Cahoon I,</i> 2008 WL 64518, at *4-5. It concluded that application of the second sentence (Sentence 2) was sidetracked by the combined effect of R.I. Gen. Laws § 43-3-26 and Warwick's municipal ordinances. <i>Id.</i> at *5-8. Consequently, the court held that the plaintiffs were not, as a statutory matter, entitled to full reimbursement of medical expenses. <i>Id.</i> at *8.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs argue that the district court erred; that Sentence 1 entitles them, even after their retirement, to full reimbursement of medical expenses; and that Sentence 2 independently produces the same result.</p>\n<p>We start with Sentence 1. The plaintiffs maintain that this sentence confers benefits not only during the course of employment but also during retirement. In their view, the language of Sentence 1 is ambiguous, and the district court's interpretation fails to effectuate the intent of the state legislature (the Rhode Island General Assembly). We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p>The language of section 45-19-1(a) is clear as a bell. The section creates two tiers of benefits: the first, codified in Sentence 1, applies to persons who are still employed but temporarily disabled; the second, codified in Sentence 2, applies to persons who are retired due to a disability. The instruction in Sentence 1 to pay \"during the period of the incapacity\" the \"salary or wage\" to which the injured worker \"would be entitled had he or she not been incapacitated\" unequivocally denotes a person <i>presently</i> employed. After all, a retiree, by definition, no longer draws a salary or wages. Rather, as Sentence 2 makes manifest, a retiree is \"placed on a ... pension.\" Equally telling is the legislature's use of the present tense (\"is employed\") in Sentence 1.</p>\n<p>This reading is reinforced by the statutory description of the benefit period as a \"period of the incapacity.\" That description plainly envisions that benefits under Sentence 1 are meant to apply for a limited time. By contrast, Sentence 2 speaks of \"retirement\"  an unlimited time. The contrary reading urged by the plaintiffs would obliterate this line of demarcation.</p>\n<p>If more were needed  and we do not think that it is  fully reimbursing the medical expenses of disabled retirees under Sentence 1 would make Sentence 2 entirely superfluous. Courts should avoid construing a statute in a way that will divest any of its component parts of meaning. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>State v. Clark,</i> 974 A.2d 558, 572 (R.I.2009); <i>Brennan v. Kirby,</i> 529 A.2d 633, 637 (R.I.1987). There is every reason to honor that precept here.</p>\n<p>Our reading of section 45-19-1(a) is wholly consistent with the case law. The state's highest court has determined that the language of the IOD statute is clear and unambiguous. <i>See </i><i>Brissette v. Potter,</i> 560 A.2d 324, 325 (R.I.1989); <i>Aiudi v. Pepin,</i> 417 A.2d 320, 321 (R.I.1980). In addition, our parsing of the statute's two sentences conforms with that court's precedents. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Webster,</i> 774 A.2d at 80 (concluding that the benefits contemplated by Sentence 1 apply to a firefighter or police officer only <i>\"while he or she remains a member of the department</i>\" (emphasis in original)); <i>Brissette,</i> 560 A.2d at 326 (stating that the \"first portion of the statute ... relates specifically to salary\" while the second clause \"relates to medical expenses for a member who has been placed on a disability pension\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> The recent case of <i>Hagenberg v. Avedisian,</i> 879 A.2d 436 (R.I.2005) mirrors the circumstances with which we are confronted. There, a retired Warwick police officer sought full reimbursement of medical expenses under the IOD statute. <i>Id.</i> at 438-39. The court held that Sentence 1 did not compel such reimbursement for an officer who had retired on a disability pension. <i>Id.</i> at 441-42 (explaining that \"[t]he IOD statute never was intended to supplement a retired officer's retirement benefits\"). As the court had explained in an earlier case, \"[u]pon acceptance of disability pension benefits,\" a plaintiff \"may not... seek additional benefits pursuant to § 45-19-1.\" <i>Elliott v. Town of Warren,</i> 818 A.2d 652, 655 (R.I.2003) (per curiam). Here, the plaintiffs availed themselves of the City's retirement benefits regime and they cannot now resort to the prophylaxis of section 45-19-1.</p>\n<p>In an effort to lessen the impact of these precedents, the plaintiffs insist that the General Assembly, by enacting section 45-19-1, intended to give disabled firefighters and police officers greater benefits than those available under traditional workers' compensation laws. This insistence puts the matter in a false light. It was only through Sentence 1, which ensures the payment of full salary and medical benefits <i>during the period of temporary incapacity,</i> that the General Assembly intended to exceed the generosity of the workers' compensation laws. <i>See </i><i>Labbadia v. State,</i> 513 A.2d 18, 21 (R.I.1986) (describing the advantages of the IOD statute vis-à-vis the workers' compensation laws). Nothing in the text of section 45-19-1 suggests that the legislature's purpose was to give injured firefighters and police officers better <i>retirement</i> benefits. <i>See </i><i>Hagenberg,</i> 879 A.2d at 441.</p>\n<p>This brings us to Sentence 2, which states that the City \"shall pay all similar expenses incurred by a member who has been placed on a disability pension.\" The plaintiffs' position is that this language cinches their entitlement to full reimbursement of medical expenses post-retirement. The language of Sentence 2, if read in a vacuum, gives this position a certain superficial allure. But a court cannot  and must not  read a statute in a vacuum, and Sentence 2 runs headlong into R.I. Gen. Laws § 43-3-26, which directs that, in cases of irreconcilable conflict between two legislative provisions, one general and the other specific, the latter \"shall prevail and shall be construed as an exception to the general provision.\"</p>\n<p>The specific provision applicable here is R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-19, which authorizes municipalities to \"provide, by ordinance or through collective bargaining, for the retirement of the personnel of their police and fire departments who have been on leave of absence from their employment due to ... injuries sustained in the performance of their duties.\" Because Warwick provides retirement medical benefits to its disabled firefighters and police officers through a combination of city ordinances and collective bargaining agreements (CBAs),<sup>[4]</sup> the court below held that this specific arrangement took precedence over the more general provision contained in Sentence 2 and, therefore, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to full medical benefits under section 45-19-1(a). <i>Cahoon I,</i> 2008 WL 64518, at *8. This holding is manifestly correct.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> We need not tarry. Sentence 2 is a general provision. It conflicts with the combination of R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-19 and the City's actions in pursuance thereof. For present purposes, this conflict renders Sentence 2 inapposite. <i>See </i><i>St. Germain v. City of Pawtucket,</i> 119 R.I. 638, 382 A.2d 180, 181 (1978) (per curiam) (concluding that city's retirement benefits law for injured firefighters was specific compared to section 45-19-1, where former was \"applicable only to the city,\" while latter was \"a general statute which applies to all cities and towns\").</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs proclaim that there is no conflict between section 45-19-1 and the City's retirement scheme. But the conflict is obvious. Warwick's ordinances provide disabled retirees with health insurance, <i>see</i> Warwick, R.I., Code of Ordinances §§ 20-60(a), 52-6(a), and this insurance covers some (but not all) medical expenses, leaving the retirees responsible for the balance. Furthermore, the insurance coverage attaches only until Medicare can be expected to bear the load. <i>Id.</i> §§ 20-60(c), 52-6(b). This scheme directly and ineluctably conflicts with the second sentence of section 45-19-1(a), which requires the full payment of any medical expenses  and does so without any Medicare hand-off. <i>See </i><i>Morry v. City of Warwick,</i> 742 A.2d 1205, 1207 (R.I.2000) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>The significance of this conflict is made clear by the decision in <i>St. Germain,</i> which explains that the General Assembly designed section 45-19-1 to protect only those firefighters and police officers who are employed by \"cities ... that do not have their own pension plans.\" 382 A.2d at 181.</p>\n<p>The statute \"in no way repeals or supersedes\" the various special acts that authorize municipalities to establish their own pension and retirement benefit plans. <i>Id.; see </i><i>Trembley v. City of Central Falls,</i> 480 A.2d 1359, 1362 (R.I.1984). Thus, where a pension system that includes medical benefits is in effect, \"§ 45-19-1 may not serve as a default source of benefits.\" <i>Elliott,</i> 818 A.2d at 655; <i>see </i><i>Hagenberg,</i> 879 A.2d at 442 (\"An injured officer employed by a municipality that has its own retirement system is restricted to the benefits provided by the particular statutory scheme.\").</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs mount two additional counter-arguments. First, they contend that the grant of health insurance coverage to retired firefighters and police officers is effectuated not by section 45-19-19, but by section 45-2-11, which gives municipalities authority to provide healthcare coverage for all employees. This latter statute, they say, is another general statute, thus eliminating the perceived conflict. This contention is unavailing.</p>\n<p>The ordinances that grant the City authority to provide health insurance coverage for its retired public safety personnel enumerate not only section 45-2-11, but also \"every other power thereunto enabling.\" Warwick, R.I., Code of Ordinances § 20-60(a); <i>see id.</i> § 52-6(a). This language plainly encompasses section 45-19-19, which addresses the narrower subset of retired firefighters and police officers.</p>\n<p>In all events, whether or not a conflict exists between sections 45-19-1 and 45-2-11, there is an undeniable conflict between both of those general provisions and the specific provision of section 45-19-19. So long as that is true, section 45-2-11 cannot come to the plaintiffs' rescue.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the plaintiffs labor to refute the conclusion that section 45-19-1 should not be read to permit, in effect, a bifurcation of benefits (some governed by state statutes and others governed by municipal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> ordinances). <i>See Cahoon I,</i> 2008 WL 64518, at *6. But the state supreme court's decision in <i>Elliott</i> stands squarely in their path. <i>See </i><i>Elliott,</i> 818 A.2d at 654 (rejecting any \"entitlement to a bifurcation of pension and medical benefits when ... a disability pension system is in place\").</p>\n<p>While the plaintiffs strive to distinguish <i>Elliott</i> on the ground that the claimant in that case was seeking <i>both</i> salary and medical expense reimbursements, <i>id.</i> at 653, there is no reason to believe that the General Assembly intended a claim for one kind of retirement benefits under section 45-19-1 to be treated differently from a claim for some other kind of retirement benefits. Indeed, the case law suggests the opposite conclusion. <i>See </i><i>Hagenberg,</i> 879 A.2d at 441-42; <i>see also </i><i>Lanni v. Ferrante,</i> 688 A.2d 865, 866 (R.I.1997) (mem.) (concluding that \"plaintiff, having voluntarily elected to recover his disability pension benefits from [the municipal pension] system ... may not ... seek benefits pursuant to § 45-19-1\"); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. O'Neil,</i> 11 F.3d 292, 296 (1st Cir.1993) (noting venerable principle that grant of a greater power includes grant of a lesser power).</p>\n<p>The short of it is that Sentence 2 functions as a gap-filling mechanism, assuring injured retirees that municipalities will not leave them completely high and dry with regard to medical expenses.<sup>[5]</sup> If, however, a municipality provides medical coverage for retirees, there is no gap to fill and, thus, no room for section 45-19-1 to furnish default benefits. <i>See </i><i>Hagenberg,</i> 879 A.2d at 442. That the benefit separately provided is less than one hundred percent of medical expenses does not alter this reality. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Elliott,</i> 818 A.2d at 655.</p>\n<p>Here, the City has created a retirement system that covers its public safety retirees and affords them medical benefits. It is this system, not Sentence 2, that dictates the medical benefits available to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>In a last-ditch effort to carry the day, the plaintiffs assert that the City's retirement plan incorporates the benefits due to retirees under section 45-19-1. This assertion lacks force.</p>\n<p>To be sure, some municipalities maintain retirement systems which, either through legislative acts or CBAs, incorporate the provisions of the IOD statute and provide that retirement benefits for disabled public safety officers should be distributed accordingly. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Brissette,</i> 560 A.2d at 325. Warwick, however, is not among that number. Nothing in the City's ordinances or CBAs indicates an intent to integrate the terms of section 45-19-1 into the City's retirement system. There would be no justification in straining to reach such a result by judicial fiat.</p>\n<p><i>Hagenberg</i> confirms this understanding. The court there explicitly stated that an officer who \"retires with a disability pension... forfeits the benefits of § 45-19-1, unless the municipality has no disability pension system.\" 879 A.2d at 442. The court's statement that the component of the City's retirement system that paid medical benefits was \"in accordance with the IOD statute,\" <i>id.</i> at 443, signifies only that the City maintained a disability retirement system that provided medical benefits sufficient to obviate any need to resort <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> to default benefits under section 45-19-1. Thus, we conclude that the plaintiffs' claims for full reimbursement of medical expenses by operation of the IOD statute, whether seen in terms of Sentence 1 or Sentence 2, are without merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Ultra Vires.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>When the City came to the belated realization that its practice of fully reimbursing disabled retirees' medical expenses was gratuitous, its personnel director (Shelton) put a stop to it. The plaintiffs contend that the decision as to whether to halt the practice was the Board's prerogative and that, therefore, Shelton's unilateral action was ultra vires.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' contention puts the cart before the horse. Warwick's ordinances explicitly provide that the Board \"has the responsibility for approving all applications for retirement, death, termination, and disability benefits.\" Warwick, R.I., Code of Ordinances §§ 20-137, 20-262; <i>see id.</i> §§ 52-36, 52-39, 52-76, 52-77, 52-80. Hence, the Board is the only entity in the City that has the authority to authorize full reimbursement of medical expenses. This is crucial because the record is barren of any evidence that the Board ever authorized the full reimbursement practice <i>on a global basis.</i></p>\n<p>Without such an authorization from the Board, the payments made by the City to reimburse medical expenses were themselves ultra vires. It follows inexorably that no special authorization was needed to halt them. After all, when a party has no lawful right to receive payments from the public fisc, halting the stream of unauthorized payments requires no particular formality. <i>See </i><i>Town of Johnston v. Pezza,</i> 723 A.2d 278, 283 (R.I.1999).<sup>[7]</sup> Absent some equitable barrier to the cessation of unauthorized payments (a matter to which we shortly shall return), a municipality is allowed to correct an ultra vires practice regardless of which municipal officer brings it to a halt. <i>See id.</i> at 284; <i>Almeida v.

Town of West Newbury,</i> 835 F.2d 380, 383 (1st Cir. 1987) (discerning no authority for the proposition that a municipality cannot \"nullif[y] an action invalid from the beginning\").</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. <i>Equitable Estoppel.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs next invoke the equitable exception to the halting of an ultra vires practice, positing that the City's prolonged reimbursement of medical expenses estops it from changing course at this late date. The district court rejected this global theory, <i>Cahoon III,</i> 2009 WL 1758738, at *7, even though it found that specific estoppel-creating promises had been made to Gordon <span class=\"star-pagination\">*28</span> and Kraczkowski, <i>Cahoon IV,</i> 2010 WL 3385040, at *4-5.</p>\n<p>To succeed on an equitable estoppel claim, a party must establish that the defendant made \"an affirmative representation... directed to [him] for the purpose of inducing [him] to act or fail to act in reliance thereon,\" and that such representation \"did induce [him] to act or fail to act to his injury.\" <i>Prov. Teachers Union v. Prov. Sch. Bd.,</i> 689 A.2d 388, 391-92 (R.I.1997) (quoting <i>Lichtenstein v. Parness,</i> 81 R.I. 135, 99 A.2d 3, 5 (1953)); <i>accord </i><i>Saccucci Auto Grp., Inc. v. Am. Honda Motor Co.,</i> 617 F.3d 14, 27 (1st Cir.2010) (applying Rhode Island law). With respect to a governmental entity, estoppel \"must be predicated upon the acts or conduct of [the public entity's] officers, agents or official bodies acting within the scope of their authority.\" <i>Potter v. Crawford,</i> 797 A.2d 489, 492 (R.I.2002) (per curiam) (internal quotation omitted). Measured against these benchmarks, the plaintiffs' estoppel claims are triply flawed.</p>\n<p>The first flaw is the absence of any evidence that the Board made either a promise or an affirmative representation to disabled firefighters and police officers generally that the City would fully reimburse disabled retirees' medical expenses. For aught that appears from the record, the Board was not consulted. In the absence of such evidence, the district court appropriately granted summary judgment on the equitable estoppel claims. <i>See </i><i>Ret. Bd. of Emps.' Ret. Sys. v. DiPrete,</i> 845 A.2d 270, 284 (R.I.2004).</p>\n<p>The second flaw is equally destructive to the fabric of the plaintiffs' argument. \"[T]he doctrine of equitable estoppel should not be applied against a governmental entity ... when, as here, the alleged representations or conduct relied upon were ultra vires.\" <i>Romano v. Ret. Bd. of Emps.' Ret. Sys.,</i> 767 A.2d 35, 38 (R.I.2001). Because the City's full reimbursement of medical expenses was ultra vires, <i>see supra</i> Part II(C), the claims for equitable estoppel founder. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Tech. Investors v. Town of Westerly,</i> 689 A.2d 1060, 1062 (R.I.1997).</p>\n<p>Third, and finally, the Rhode Island Supreme Court has noted that \"[t]he key element of an estoppel is intentionally induced prejudicial reliance.\" <i>El Marocco Club, Inc. v. Richardson,</i> 746 A.2d 1228, 1234 (R.I.2000) (quoting <i>E. Greenwich Yacht Club v. Coastal Res. Mgmt. Council,</i> 118 R.I. 559, 376 A.2d 682, 686 (1977)). The plaintiffs have proffered nothing to show that the City <i>intentionally</i> induced reliance on a continuation of full reimbursement (indeed, they have not even identified a reason why the City might have wanted to induce such reliance). The lack of any such proof is, in itself, a sufficient basis for summary judgment on these claims. <i>See </i><i>Leiter v. Allstate Ins. Co.,</i> 725 A.2d 882, 883-84 (R.I.1999) (per curiam).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>E. <i>Due Process.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>The plaintiffs' last remonstrance charges that Shelton's termination of the past practice without a hearing took their property without due process of law. This remonstrance need not occupy us for long.</p>\n<p>It is apodictic that the Constitution \"imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of... `property' interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause.\" <i>Mathews v. Eldridge,</i> 424 U.S. 319, 332, 96 S.Ct. 893, 47 L.Ed.2d 18 (1976). A court tasked with determining whether a constitutionally protected property interest exists must look to \"existing rules or understandings that stem from an independent source such as state law.\" <i>Bd. of Regents of State Colls. v. Roth,</i> 408 U.S. 564, 577, 92 S.Ct. <span class=\"star-pagination\">*29</span> 2701, 33 L.Ed.2d 548 (1972). A party's unilateral expectation, in itself, cannot create a constitutionally protected property interest. <i>Webb's Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith,</i> 449 U.S. 155, 161, 101 S.Ct. 446, 66 L.Ed.2d 358 (1980); <i>Young v. Wall,</i> 642 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir.2011).</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs have not identified any source that would give rise to a constitutionally protected property interest in the continuation of full reimbursement. For example, there is no statutory requirement that the City reimburse retired firefighters and police officers for medical expenses beyond what is already provided through the retirement system. <i>See supra</i> Part II(B). Nor have the plaintiffs shown a property interest forged through the operation of equitable principles. <i>See supra</i> Part II(D). While we do not question the sincerity of the plaintiffs' desire to continue receiving full reimbursement, such a desire, unanchored in a state law or rule, is not enough to ground a procedural due process claim.<sup>[8]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>Young,</i> 642 F.3d at 55; <i>Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio,</i> 406 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. <i>Gordon and Kraczkowski.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As we already have explained, Gordon and Kraczkowski prevailed at a bench trial on their estoppel claims because the Board had made specific commitments to them. Consequently, they continue to receive full reimbursement of medical expenses. Nevertheless, they contend that judgment should not have been entered against them on their ultra vires and procedural due process claims.</p>\n<p>Gordon and Kraczkowski have not explained what other or further relief they might be entitled to receive on these theories. They simply assert, without elaboration and in conclusory fashion, an entitlement to relief. We long have held that claims asserted in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by developed argumentation, are deemed abandoned. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> 895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir.1990). So it is here.</p>\n<p>Another infirmity is apparent. The district court granted summary judgment on the ultra vires and procedural due process claims, <i>see Cahoon I,</i> 2008 WL 64518, at *9-11, before Gordon and Kraczkowski, in a later bench trial, established the existence of specific promises of full reimbursement, <i>see Cahoon IV,</i> 2010 WL 3385040, at *5. This changed factual finding presented an avenue by which Gordon and Kraczkowski could, and should, have sought the additional relief they desired. <i>See </i><i>In re Sun Pipe Line Co.,</i> 831 F.2d 22, 24 (1st Cir.1987). But neither Gordon nor Kraczkowski ever asked the district court to modify its earlier judgment on the ultra vires and due process claims in light of <i>Cahoon IV. See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e); <i>In re Sun Pipe Line,</i> 831 F.2d at 24 (explaining that a motion asking \"the court to modify its earlier disposition of a case because of an allegedly erroneous legal result is brought under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e)\").</p>\n<p>\"[I]t is black letter law that it is a party's first obligation to seek any relief that might fairly have been thought available in the district court before seeking it on appeal.\" <i>Beaulieu v. IRS,</i> 865 F.2d 1351, 1352 (1st Cir.1989). Gordon and Kraczkowski flouted this obligation. Given the circumstances of this case, we see no reason to consider their request for additional (unspecified) relief as a matter of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> first impression. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth Coll.,</i> 889 F.2d 13, 22 n. 9 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>To sum up, government officials have a solemn duty to expend public funds in accordance with law. Although we understand the plaintiffs' frustration  after all, the City buoyed their hopes when it mistakenly plunged ahead, over a period of years, to make full reimbursement of disabled public safety retirees' medical expenses  they have not, as a class, shown any basis in law or in equity sufficient to force the City to perpetuate this erroneous practice. Taxpayers, too, have rights.</p>\n<p>We do, however, make an exception for Gordon and Kraczkowski. Each of them has succeeded in making out a claimant-specific case for estoppel. They have earned the right to the relief that the district court ordered.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. The district court patiently explored the complexities of these tangled issues and reached a correct result.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The underlying action was originally commenced by thirty-nine plaintiffs, but six have fallen by the wayside.</p>\n<p>[2]  For purposes of this opinion, we limit the term \"medical expenses\" to those expenses incurred to cure or relieve the effects of injuries arising out of a firefighter's or police officer's employment.</p>\n<p>[3]  We say \"ordinarily\" because, plain language notwithstanding, a statute should never be construed in a way that produces an absurd result. <i>Ryan v. City of Providence,</i> 11 A.3d 68, 71 (R.I.2011).</p>\n<p>[4]  Warwick firefighters and police officers are afforded pensions and health insurance coverage, regardless of whether or not retirement is due to a disability. <i>See</i> Warwick, R.I., Code of Ordinances §§ 20-101, 20-161, 52-36, 52-76 (pensions); <i>id.</i> §§ 20-60, 52-6 (health insurance). The CBAs between the City and the public safety unions echo these arrangements.</p>\n<p>[5]  The plaintiffs suggest that Sentence 2, rather than functioning as a gap-filler, was a legislative response to the decision in <i>Santanelli v. City of Providence,</i> 105 R.I. 208, 250 A.2d 849 (1969). However, the amendment of the IOD statute to include Sentence 2 occurred a full six years after <i>Santanelli</i> was decided. The alleged cause-and-effect relationship is pure conjecture and, in any event, Sentence 2's language is inhospitable to the suggestion.</p>\n<p>[6]  To the extent that the plaintiffs challenge the propriety of summary judgment because the record is silent as to whether the Board approved full reimbursement of medical expenses globally, that challenge is bootless. A party who bears the burden of proof on an issue cannot defeat summary judgment by relying on speculation about the facts. <i>Ahern v. Shinseki,</i> 629 F.3d 49, 54 (1st Cir.2010). Such a party must offer \"definite, competent evidence to rebut the motion.\" <i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 950 F.2d 816, 822 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p>[7]  The plaintiffs insist that <i>Pezza</i> is off-point because the person terminating the unlawfully issued building permit had authority to rescind permits not in compliance with the town's zoning requirements. But this is a distinction without a difference. What matters is that the initial act was unauthorized and, therefore, a nullity. <i>See </i><i>Town of Charlestown v. Beattie,</i> 422 A.2d 1250, 1252 (R.I.1980).</p>\n<p>[8]  The plaintiffs make a feeble attempt to argue that the termination of full reimbursement deprived them of substantive due process. This argument appears for the first time in their reply brief. It is, therefore, waived. <i>See </i><i>Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp.,</i> 904 F.2d 83, 86 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n\n</div>",

In this case, a municipality became convinced that former firefighters and police officers who had retired on disability pensions were collecting a particular benefit (full reimbursement of certain medical expenses) without legal warrant. The municipality acted on this conviction and stopped paying the tab. A group of affected retirees sued to enforce continued payment, alleging that the municipality's about-face violated state statutes, constituted an ultra vires act, contradicted principles of equity, and offended the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.</p>\n<p>The district court entered summary judgment against all but three of the plaintiffs. The court then held a bench trial and resolved the remaining claims. The plaintiffs appeal the summary judgment rulings. We affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. BACKGROUND</h2>\n<p>We briefly rehearse the relevant factual and procedural background, supplementing this bare-bones account in our subsequent discussion of particular issues.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs comprise thirty-three retired firefighters and police officers previously employed by Warwick, Rhode Island (the City).<sup>[1]</sup> At various points over the past three decades, each of them sustained a debilitating injury in the line of duty, resulting in a grant of disability leave by the City's Board of Public Safety (the Board). When it became apparent that the plaintiffs' injuries precluded a return to active duty, the Board exercised its discretion to place them in retirement. <i>See</i> Warwick, R.I., Code of Ordinances §§ 20-112(a)(1), 20-202(a)(1), 52-38(a), 52-76(a). Each plaintiff received a disability pension that included defined medical benefits.</p>\n<p>The present dispute centers on the extent of this benefit. In the first instance, the City funds the payment of retirees' medical expenses<sup>[2]</sup> through health insurance, which covers part, but not all, of those costs. For many years, the City also reimbursed excess medical expenses (i.e., expenses not covered by insurance). This meant that one hundred percent of each retiree's medical expenses was reimbursed.</p>\n<p>In 2003, the City took a fresh look at its past practice and concluded that, in accordance with a recent decision of the Rhode Island Supreme Court, it was not obliged to reimburse all of a disabled retiree's medical expenses. Consequently, the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*21</span> City's personnel director, Oscar Shelton, informed the plaintiffs, by letter dated December 11, 2003, that as of January 1, 2004, the City would no longer reimburse medical expenses not covered by insurance. Because the letter directed disabled retirees instead to the health insurance provided as part of their pensions, it had the additional effect of requiring that, upon reaching the age of sixty-five, disabled retirees would have to apply for Medicare.</p>\n<p>Dismayed by this about-face, the plaintiffs asked for a hearing before the Board. The Board responded that</p>\n<blockquote>[a]lthough [the] request can be placed on the agenda, the Board's position is, pursuant to the [Rhode Island] Supreme Court decision, that any retiree who has written confirmation that the City and/or Board of Public Safety will pay 100% of [on-the-job injury] related medical bills after retirement will have those bills paid in full. Otherwise, the Board's position is that the City's health insurance, as part of the retirement plan, meets the City's obligation.</blockquote>\n<p>After unsuccessfully presenting their claims to the City Council, <i>see</i> R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-15-5, the plaintiffs brought suit in state court against the Board, the City, and a myriad of municipal officials (including Shelton). Their complaint challenged termination of the practice of fully reimbursing medical expenses as violative of state statutory law, unauthorized, barred by principles of equitable estoppel, and offensive to due process. The defendants removed the action to the federal district court. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. §§ 1331, 1441.</p>\n<p>In due season, the defendants sought summary judgment. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 56. The district court initially granted the motion on all claims. <i>Cahoon v. Shelton</i> (<i>Cahoon I</i>), No. 07-008, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">64518</span></span>, at *12 (D.R.I. Jan. 4, 2008). On the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, the court later vacated the judgment with respect to the equitable estoppel claims. <i>See Cahoon v. Shelton</i> (<i>Cahoon II</i>), No. 07-008, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">6514326</span></span>, at *1 (D.R.I. Mar. 10, 2008). After further discovery limited to the equitable estoppel issue, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the estoppel claims of all but three of the plaintiffs. <i>See Cahoon v. Shelton</i> (<i>Cahoon III</i>), No. 07-008, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2009</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">1758738</span></span>, at *7 (D.R.I. June 18, 2009).</p>\n<p>The three exempted plaintiffs (James Gordon, Michael Kraczkowski, and Thomas Thompson) tried their estoppel claims to the court, which found that the Board had explicitly promised to reimburse all of Gordon's and Kraczkowski's medical expenses but had made no comparable promise to Thompson. <i>See Cahoon v. Shelton</i> (<i>Cahoon IV</i>), No. 07-008, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3385040</span></span>, at *3-4 (D.R.I. Aug. 26, 2010). The court entered judgment accordingly. <i>Id.</i> at *5. The plaintiffs' timely appeal of the summary judgment rulings followed. The defendants have not appealed the judgments in favor of Gordon and Kraczkowski on the bench-tried estoppel claims. For his part, Thompson has not appealed from the adverse findings in the bench trial (although he, like the plaintiffs generally, continues to press a global claim of estoppel).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. ANALYSIS</h2>\n<p>In this venue, the plaintiffs resurrect the same asseverational array that they presented in the court below. After delineating the legal standards that govern our inquiry, we address each of the plaintiffs' four global asseverations. We then turn to the individualized and conceptually distinct claims mounted by Gordon and Kraczkowski. Because the latter two claims stand on a different conceptual footing, we hereafter use the term \"the plaintiffs\" to <span class=\"star-pagination\">*22</span> designate all the plaintiffs other than Gordon and Kraczkowski.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. <i>Legal Standards.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Our review of a district court's entry of summary judgment is de novo. <i>Dávila v.

We will affirm the decision only if the record reveals no genuine issue as to any material fact and discloses that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>Vineberg v.

The Rhode Island Supreme Court has made it pellucid that in interpreting state statutes, a court's \"ultimate goal is to give effect to the purpose of the act as intended by the Legislature.\" <i>Webster v. Perrotta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1515913\"><a href=\"/opinion/1515913/webster-v-perrotta/\"><span class=\"volume\">774</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 75 (R.I.2001). \"The best evidence of such intent can be found in the plain language used in the statute.\" <i>Steinhof v.

Ins. Co. v. Kaya,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1542155\"><a href=\"/opinion/1542155/liberty-mut-ins-co-v-kaya/\"><span class=\"volume\">947</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">869</span></a></span>, 872 (R.I.2008).

The touchstone of this argument is the injured-on-duty (IOD) statute, which reads in relevant part:</p>\n<blockquote>Whenever ... any police officer [or] fire fighter ... of any city ... is wholly or partially incapacitated by reason of injuries received ... in the performance of his or her duties ..., the respective city... by which the police officer [or] fire fighter ... is employed, shall, during the period of the incapacity, pay the police officer [or] fire fighter ... the salary or wage and benefits to which the police officer [or] fire fighter ... would be entitled had he or she not been incapacitated, and shall pay the medical [expenses] for the necessary period.... In addition, the cities ... shall pay all similar expenses incurred by a member who has been placed on a disability pension and suffers a recurrence of the injury or illness that dictated his or her disability retirement.</blockquote>\n<p>R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-1(a).</p>\n<p>The IOD statute comprises two sentences. The district court concluded that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*23</span> neither sentence was sufficient to carry the burden of the plaintiffs' statutory argument. The court reasoned that the first sentence (Sentence 1) did not apply because, as retirees, the plaintiffs were no longer employed by the City. <i>Cahoon I,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">64518</span></span>, at *4-5. It concluded that application of the second sentence (Sentence 2) was sidetracked by the combined effect of R.I. Gen. Laws § 43-3-26 and Warwick's municipal ordinances. <i>Id.</i> at *5-8. Consequently, the court held that the plaintiffs were not, as a statutory matter, entitled to full reimbursement of medical expenses. <i>Id.</i> at *8.</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs argue that the district court erred; that Sentence 1 entitles them, even after their retirement, to full reimbursement of medical expenses; and that Sentence 2 independently produces the same result.</p>\n<p>We start with Sentence 1. The plaintiffs maintain that this sentence confers benefits not only during the course of employment but also during retirement. In their view, the language of Sentence 1 is ambiguous, and the district court's interpretation fails to effectuate the intent of the state legislature (the Rhode Island General Assembly). We find this argument unpersuasive.</p>\n<p>The language of section 45-19-1(a) is clear as a bell. The section creates two tiers of benefits: the first, codified in Sentence 1, applies to persons who are still employed but temporarily disabled; the second, codified in Sentence 2, applies to persons who are retired due to a disability. The instruction in Sentence 1 to pay \"during the period of the incapacity\" the \"salary or wage\" to which the injured worker \"would be entitled had he or she not been incapacitated\" unequivocally denotes a person <i>presently</i> employed. After all, a retiree, by definition, no longer draws a salary or wages. Rather, as Sentence 2 makes manifest, a retiree is \"placed on a ... pension.\" Equally telling is the legislature's use of the present tense (\"is employed\") in Sentence 1.</p>\n<p>This reading is reinforced by the statutory description of the benefit period as a \"period of the incapacity.\" That description plainly envisions that benefits under Sentence 1 are meant to apply for a limited time. By contrast, Sentence 2 speaks of \"retirement\"  an unlimited time. The contrary reading urged by the plaintiffs would obliterate this line of demarcation.</p>\n<p>If more were needed  and we do not think that it is  fully reimbursing the medical expenses of disabled retirees under Sentence 1 would make Sentence 2 entirely superfluous. Courts should avoid construing a statute in a way that will divest any of its component parts of meaning. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>State v. Clark,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1540089\"><a href=\"/opinion/1540089/state-v-clark/\"><span class=\"volume\">974</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span>, 572 (R.I.2009); <i>Brennan v.

There is every reason to honor that precept here.</p>\n<p>Our reading of section 45-19-1(a) is wholly consistent with the case law. The state's highest court has determined that the language of the IOD statute is clear and unambiguous. <i>See </i><i>Brissette v. Potter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1936443\"><a href=\"/opinion/1936443/brissette-v-potter/\"><span class=\"volume\">560</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">324</span></a></span>, 325 (R.I.1989); <i>Aiudi v.

In addition, our parsing of the statute's two sentences conforms with that court's precedents. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Webster,</i> 774 A.2d at 80 (concluding that the benefits contemplated by Sentence 1 apply to a firefighter or police officer only <i>\"while he or she remains a member of the department</i>\" (emphasis in original)); <i>Brissette,</i> 560 A.2d at 326 (stating that the \"first portion of the statute ... relates specifically to salary\" while the second clause \"relates to medical expenses for a member who has been placed on a disability pension\").</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*24</span> The recent case of <i>Hagenberg v. Avedisian,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2403522\"><a href=\"/opinion/2403522/hagenberg-v-avedisian/\"><span class=\"volume\">879</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">436</span></a></span> (R.I.2005) mirrors the circumstances with which we are confronted. There, a retired Warwick police officer sought full reimbursement of medical expenses under the IOD statute. <i>Id.</i> at 438-39. The court held that Sentence 1 did not compel such reimbursement for an officer who had retired on a disability pension. <i>Id.</i> at 441-42 (explaining that \"[t]he IOD statute never was intended to supplement a retired officer's retirement benefits\"). As the court had explained in an earlier case, \"[u]pon acceptance of disability pension benefits,\" a plaintiff \"may not... seek additional benefits pursuant to § 45-19-1.\" <i>Elliott v. Town of Warren,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">818</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">652</span></span>, 655 (R.I.2003) (per curiam). Here, the plaintiffs availed themselves of the City's retirement benefits regime and they cannot now resort to the prophylaxis of section 45-19-1.</p>\n<p>In an effort to lessen the impact of these precedents, the plaintiffs insist that the General Assembly, by enacting section 45-19-1, intended to give disabled firefighters and police officers greater benefits than those available under traditional workers' compensation laws. This insistence puts the matter in a false light. It was only through Sentence 1, which ensures the payment of full salary and medical benefits <i>during the period of temporary incapacity,</i> that the General Assembly intended to exceed the generosity of the workers' compensation laws. <i>See </i><i>Labbadia v. State,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2088270\"><a href=\"/opinion/2088270/labbadia-v-state/\"><span class=\"volume\">513</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 21 (R.I.1986) (describing the advantages of the IOD statute vis-à-vis the workers' compensation laws). Nothing in the text of section 45-19-1 suggests that the legislature's purpose was to give injured firefighters and police officers better <i>retirement</i> benefits. <i>See </i><i>Hagenberg,</i> 879 A.2d at 441.</p>\n<p>This brings us to Sentence 2, which states that the City \"shall pay all similar expenses incurred by a member who has been placed on a disability pension.\" The plaintiffs' position is that this language cinches their entitlement to full reimbursement of medical expenses post-retirement. The language of Sentence 2, if read in a vacuum, gives this position a certain superficial allure. But a court cannot  and must not  read a statute in a vacuum, and Sentence 2 runs headlong into R.I. Gen. Laws § 43-3-26, which directs that, in cases of irreconcilable conflict between two legislative provisions, one general and the other specific, the latter \"shall prevail and shall be construed as an exception to the general provision.\"</p>\n<p>The specific provision applicable here is R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-19, which authorizes municipalities to \"provide, by ordinance or through collective bargaining, for the retirement of the personnel of their police and fire departments who have been on leave of absence from their employment due to ... injuries sustained in the performance of their duties.\" Because Warwick provides retirement medical benefits to its disabled firefighters and police officers through a combination of city ordinances and collective bargaining agreements (CBAs),<sup>[4]</sup> the court below held that this specific arrangement took precedence over the more general provision contained in Sentence 2 and, therefore, that the plaintiffs were not entitled to full medical benefits under section 45-19-1(a). <i>Cahoon I,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">64518</span></span>, at *8. This holding is manifestly correct.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*25</span> We need not tarry. Sentence 2 is a general provision. It conflicts with the combination of R.I. Gen. Laws § 45-19-19 and the City's actions in pursuance thereof. For present purposes, this conflict renders Sentence 2 inapposite. <i>See </i><i>St. Germain v. City of Pawtucket,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">638</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1442391\"><a href=\"/opinion/1442391/st-germain-v-city-of-pawtucket/\"><span class=\"volume\">382</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">180</span></a></span>, 181 (1978) (per curiam) (concluding that city's retirement benefits law for injured firefighters was specific compared to section 45-19-1, where former was \"applicable only to the city,\" while latter was \"a general statute which applies to all cities and towns\").</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs proclaim that there is no conflict between section 45-19-1 and the City's retirement scheme. But the conflict is obvious. Warwick's ordinances provide disabled retirees with health insurance, <i>see</i> Warwick, R.I., Code of Ordinances §§ 20-60(a), 52-6(a), and this insurance covers some (but not all) medical expenses, leaving the retirees responsible for the balance. Furthermore, the insurance coverage attaches only until Medicare can be expected to bear the load. <i>Id.</i> §§ 20-60(c), 52-6(b). This scheme directly and ineluctably conflicts with the second sentence of section 45-19-1(a), which requires the full payment of any medical expenses  and does so without any Medicare hand-off. <i>See </i><i>Morry v. City of Warwick,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2183111\"><a href=\"/opinion/2183111/morry-v-city-of-warwick/\"><span class=\"volume\">742</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1205</span></a></span>, 1207 (R.I.2000) (per curiam).</p>\n<p>The significance of this conflict is made clear by the decision in <i>St. Germain,</i> which explains that the General Assembly designed section 45-19-1 to protect only those firefighters and police officers who are employed by \"cities ... that do not have their own pension plans.\" 382 A.2d at 181.</p>\n<p>The statute \"in no way repeals or supersedes\" the various special acts that authorize municipalities to establish their own pension and retirement benefit plans. <i>Id.; see </i><i>Trembley v. City of Central Falls,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2049551\"><a href=\"/opinion/2049551/trembley-v-city-of-central-falls/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1359</span></a></span>, 1362 (R.I.1984). Thus, where a pension system that includes medical benefits is in effect, \"§ 45-19-1 may not serve as a default source of benefits.\" <i>Elliott,</i> 818 A.2d at 655; <i>see </i><i>Hagenberg,</i> 879 A.2d at 442 (\"An injured officer employed by a municipality that has its own retirement system is restricted to the benefits provided by the particular statutory scheme.\").</p>\n<p>The plaintiffs mount two additional counter-arguments. First, they contend that the grant of health insurance coverage to retired firefighters and police officers is effectuated not by section 45-19-19, but by section 45-2-11, which gives municipalities authority to provide healthcare coverage for all employees. This latter statute, they say, is another general statute, thus eliminating the perceived conflict. This contention is unavailing.</p>\n<p>The ordinances that grant the City authority to provide health insurance coverage for its retired public safety personnel enumerate not only section 45-2-11, but also \"every other power thereunto enabling.\" Warwick, R.I., Code of Ordinances § 20-60(a); <i>see id.</i> § 52-6(a). This language plainly encompasses section 45-19-19, which addresses the narrower subset of retired firefighters and police officers.</p>\n<p>In all events, whether or not a conflict exists between sections 45-19-1 and 45-2-11, there is an undeniable conflict between both of those general provisions and the specific provision of section 45-19-19. So long as that is true, section 45-2-11 cannot come to the plaintiffs' rescue.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the plaintiffs labor to refute the conclusion that section 45-19-1 should not be read to permit, in effect, a bifurcation of benefits (some governed by state statutes and others governed by municipal <span class=\"star-pagination\">*26</span> ordinances). <i>See Cahoon I,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">64518</span></span>, at *6. But the state supreme court's decision in <i>Elliott</i> stands squarely in their path. <i>See </i><i>Elliott,</i> 818 A.2d at 654 (rejecting any \"entitlement to a bifurcation of pension and medical benefits when ... a disability pension system is in place\").</p>\n<p>While the plaintiffs strive to distinguish <i>Elliott</i> on the ground that the claimant in that case was seeking <i>both</i> salary and medical expense reimbursements, <i>id.</i> at 653, there is no reason to believe that the General Assembly intended a claim for one kind of retirement benefits under section 45-19-1 to be treated differently from a claim for some other kind of retirement benefits. Indeed, the case law suggests the opposite conclusion. <i>See </i><i>Hagenberg,</i> 879 A.2d at 441-42; <i>see also </i><i>Lanni v. Ferrante,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2366264\"><a href=\"/opinion/2366264/lanni-v-ferrante/\"><span class=\"volume\">688</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></a></span>, 866 (R.I.1997) (mem.) (concluding that \"plaintiff, having voluntarily elected to recover his disability pension benefits from [the municipal pension] system ... may not ... seek benefits pursuant to § 45-19-1\"); <i>cf. </i><i>United States v. O'Neil,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658542\"><a href=\"/opinion/658542/united-states-v-shaun-k-oneil/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">292</span></a></span>, 296 (1st Cir.1993) (noting venerable principle that grant of a greater power includes grant of a lesser power).</p>\n<p>The short of it is that Sentence 2 functions as a gap-filling mechanism, assuring injured retirees that municipalities will not leave them completely high and dry with regard to medical expenses.<sup>[5]</sup> If, however, a municipality provides medical coverage for retirees, there is no gap to fill and, thus, no room for section 45-19-1 to furnish default benefits. <i>See </i><i>Hagenberg,</i> 879 A.2d at 442. That the benefit separately provided is less than one hundred percent of medical expenses does not alter this reality. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Elliott,</i> 818 A.2d at 655.</p>\n<p>Here, the City has created a retirement system that covers its public safety retirees and affords them medical benefits. It is this system, not Sentence 2, that dictates the medical benefits available to the plaintiffs.</p>\n<p>In a last-ditch effort to carry the day, the plaintiffs assert that the City's retirement plan incorporates the benefits due to retirees under section 45-19-1. This assertion lacks force.</p>\n<p>To be sure, some municipalities maintain retirement systems which, either through legislative acts or CBAs, incorporate the provisions of the IOD statute and provide that retirement benefits for disabled public safety officers should be distributed accordingly. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Brissette,</i> 560 A.2d at 325. Warwick, however, is not among that number. Nothing in the City's ordinances or CBAs indicates an intent to integrate the terms of section 45-19-1 into the City's retirement system. There would be no justification in straining to reach such a result by judicial fiat.</p>\n<p><i>Hagenberg</i> confirms this understanding. The court there explicitly stated that an officer who \"retires with a disability pension... forfeits the benefits of § 45-19-1, unless the municipality has no disability pension system.\" 879 A.2d at 442. The court's statement that the component of the City's retirement system that paid medical benefits was \"in accordance with the IOD statute,\" <i>id.</i> at 443, signifies only that the City maintained a disability retirement system that provided medical benefits sufficient to obviate any need to resort <span class=\"star-pagination\">*27</span> to default benefits under section 45-19-1. Thus, we conclude that the plaintiffs' claims for full reimbursement of medical expenses by operation of the IOD statute, whether seen in terms of Sentence 1 or Sentence 2, are without merit.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. <i>Ultra Vires.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>When the City came to the belated realization that its practice of fully reimbursing disabled retirees' medical expenses was gratuitous, its personnel director (Shelton) put a stop to it. The plaintiffs contend that the decision as to whether to halt the practice was the Board's prerogative and that, therefore, Shelton's unilateral action was ultra vires.<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>The plaintiffs' contention puts the cart before the horse. Warwick's ordinances explicitly provide that the Board \"has the responsibility for approving all applications for retirement, death, termination, and disability benefits.\" Warwick, R.I., Code of Ordinances §§ 20-137, 20-262; <i>see id.</i> §§ 52-36, 52-39, 52-76, 52-77, 52-80. Hence, the Board is the only entity in the City that has the authority to authorize full reimbursement of medical expenses. This is crucial because the record is barren of any evidence that the Board ever authorized the full reimbursement practice <i>on a global basis.</i></p>\n<p>Without such an authorization from the Board, the payments made by the City to reimburse medical expenses were themselves ultra vires. It follows inexorably that no special authorization was needed to halt them. After all, when a party has no lawful right to receive payments from the public fisc, halting the stream of unauthorized payments requires no particular formality. <i>See </i><i>Town of Johnston v. Pezza,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2102207\"><a href=\"/opinion/2102207/town-of-johnston-v-pezza/\"><span class=\"volume\">723</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">278</span></a></span>, 283 (R.I.1999).<sup>[7]</sup> Absent some equitable barrier to the cessation of unauthorized payments (a matter to which we shortly shall return), a municipality is allowed to correct an ultra vires practice regardless of which municipal officer brings it to a halt. <i>See id.</i> at 284; <i>Almeida v.

Measured against these benchmarks, the plaintiffs' estoppel claims are triply flawed.</p>\n<p>The first flaw is the absence of any evidence that the Board made either a promise or an affirmative representation to disabled firefighters and police officers generally that the City would fully reimburse disabled retirees' medical expenses. For aught that appears from the record, the Board was not consulted.

Because the City's full reimbursement of medical expenses was ultra vires, <i>see supra</i> Part II(C), the claims for equitable estoppel founder. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Tech. Investors v.

For example, there is no statutory requirement that the City reimburse retired firefighters and police officers for medical expenses beyond what is already provided through the retirement system. <i>See supra</i> Part II(B). Nor have the plaintiffs shown a property interest forged through the operation of equitable principles. <i>See supra</i> Part II(D). While we do not question the sincerity of the plaintiffs' desire to continue receiving full reimbursement, such a desire, unanchored in a state law or rule, is not enough to ground a procedural due process claim.<sup>[8]</sup><i>See, e.g., </i><i>Young,</i> 642 F.3d at 55; <i>Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. Feliciano de Melecio,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201545\"><a href=\"/opinion/201545/centro-medico-del-v-feliciano-de-melecio/\"><span class=\"volume\">406</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 8 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>F. <i>Gordon and Kraczkowski.</i>\n</h2>\n<p>As we already have explained, Gordon and Kraczkowski prevailed at a bench trial on their estoppel claims because the Board had made specific commitments to them. Consequently, they continue to receive full reimbursement of medical expenses. Nevertheless, they contend that judgment should not have been entered against them on their ultra vires and procedural due process claims.</p>\n<p>Gordon and Kraczkowski have not explained what other or further relief they might be entitled to receive on these theories. They simply assert, without elaboration and in conclusory fashion, an entitlement to relief. We long have held that claims asserted in a perfunctory manner, unaccompanied by developed argumentation, are deemed abandoned. <i>United States v. Zannino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"536025\"><a href=\"/opinion/536025/united-states-v-ilario-ma-zannino/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 17 (1st Cir.1990). So it is here.</p>\n<p>Another infirmity is apparent. The district court granted summary judgment on the ultra vires and procedural due process claims, <i>see Cahoon I,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2008</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">64518</span></span>, at *9-11, before Gordon and Kraczkowski, in a later bench trial, established the existence of specific promises of full reimbursement, <i>see Cahoon IV,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">2010</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">3385040</span></span>, at *5. This changed factual finding presented an avenue by which Gordon and Kraczkowski could, and should, have sought the additional relief they desired. <i>See </i><i>In re Sun Pipe Line Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"495473\"><a href=\"/opinion/495473/application-for-issuance-of-order-requiring-the-united-states-environmental/\"><span class=\"volume\">831</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">22</span></a></span>, 24 (1st Cir.1987). But neither Gordon nor Kraczkowski ever asked the district court to modify its earlier judgment on the ultra vires and due process claims in light of <i>Cahoon IV. See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e); <i>In re Sun Pipe Line,</i> 831 F.2d at 24 (explaining that a motion asking \"the court to modify its earlier disposition of a case because of an allegedly erroneous legal result is brought under Fed.R.Civ.P. 59(e)\").</p>\n<p>\"[I]t is black letter law that it is a party's first obligation to seek any relief that might fairly have been thought available in the district court before seeking it on appeal.\" <i>Beaulieu v. IRS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"517428\"><a href=\"/opinion/517428/janet-a-beaulieu-v-united-states-of-america-internal-revenue-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1351</span></a></span>, 1352 (1st Cir.1989). Gordon and Kraczkowski flouted this obligation. Given the circumstances of this case, we see no reason to consider their request for additional (unspecified) relief as a matter of <span class=\"star-pagination\">*30</span> first impression. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Dartmouth Review v. Dartmouth Coll.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"531870\"><a href=\"/opinion/531870/the-dartmouth-review-on-behalf-of-its-officers-staff-and-subscribers-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">889</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">13</span></a></span>, 22 n. 9 (1st Cir.1989).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. CONCLUSION</h2>\n<p>To sum up, government officials have a solemn duty to expend public funds in accordance with law. Although we understand the plaintiffs' frustration  after all, the City buoyed their hopes when it mistakenly plunged ahead, over a period of years, to make full reimbursement of disabled public safety retirees' medical expenses  they have not, as a class, shown any basis in law or in equity sufficient to force the City to perpetuate this erroneous practice. Taxpayers, too, have rights.</p>\n<p>We do, however, make an exception for Gordon and Kraczkowski. Each of them has succeeded in making out a claimant-specific case for estoppel. They have earned the right to the relief that the district court ordered.</p>\n<p>We need go no further. The district court patiently explored the complexities of these tangled issues and reached a correct result.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  The underlying action was originally commenced by thirty-nine plaintiffs, but six have fallen by the wayside.</p>\n<p>[2]  For purposes of this opinion, we limit the term \"medical expenses\" to those expenses incurred to cure or relieve the effects of injuries arising out of a firefighter's or police officer's employment.</p>\n<p>[3]  We say \"ordinarily\" because, plain language notwithstanding, a statute should never be construed in a way that produces an absurd result. <i>Ryan v. City of Providence,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2549596\"><a href=\"/opinion/2549596/ryan-v-city-of-providence/\"><span class=\"volume\">11</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">68</span></a></span>, 71 (R.I.2011).</p>\n<p>[4]  Warwick firefighters and police officers are afforded pensions and health insurance coverage, regardless of whether or not retirement is due to a disability. <i>See</i> Warwick, R.I., Code of Ordinances §§ 20-101, 20-161, 52-36, 52-76 (pensions); <i>id.</i> §§ 20-60, 52-6 (health insurance). The CBAs between the City and the public safety unions echo these arrangements.</p>\n<p>[5]  The plaintiffs suggest that Sentence 2, rather than functioning as a gap-filler, was a legislative response to the decision in <i>Santanelli v. City of Providence,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">105</span> <span class=\"reporter\">R.I.</span> <span class=\"page\">208</span></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1946678\"><a href=\"/opinion/1946678/santanelli-v-city-of-providence/\"><span class=\"volume\">250</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">849</span></a></span> (1969). However, the amendment of the IOD statute to include Sentence 2 occurred a full six years after <i>Santanelli</i> was decided. The alleged cause-and-effect relationship is pure conjecture and, in any event, Sentence 2's language is inhospitable to the suggestion.</p>\n<p>[6]  To the extent that the plaintiffs challenge the propriety of summary judgment because the record is silent as to whether the Board approved full reimbursement of medical expenses globally, that challenge is bootless. A party who bears the burden of proof on an issue cannot defeat summary judgment by relying on speculation about the facts. <i>Ahern v. Shinseki,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"180959\"><a href=\"/opinion/180959/ahern-v-shinseki/\"><span class=\"volume\">629</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 54 (1st Cir.2010). Such a party must offer \"definite, competent evidence to rebut the motion.\" <i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 822 (1st Cir. 1991).</p>\n<p>[7]  The plaintiffs insist that <i>Pezza</i> is off-point because the person terminating the unlawfully issued building permit had authority to rescind permits not in compliance with the town's zoning requirements. But this is a distinction without a difference. What matters is that the initial act was unauthorized and, therefore, a nullity. <i>See </i><i>Town of Charlestown v. Beattie,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2312192\"><a href=\"/opinion/2312192/town-of-charlestown-v-beattie/\"><span class=\"volume\">422</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1250</span></a></span>, 1252 (R.I.1980).</p>\n<p>[8]  The plaintiffs make a feeble attempt to argue that the termination of full reimbursement deprived them of substantive due process. This argument appears for the first time in their reply brief. It is, therefore, waived. <i>See </i><i>Sandstrom v. ChemLawn Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"542293\"><a href=\"/opinion/542293/richard-l-sandstrom-etc-v-chemlawn-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">904</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir.1990).</p>\n\n</div>",
