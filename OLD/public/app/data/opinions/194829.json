Based on  evidence  obtained\n                            \n\nthrough a warrantless search of airport luggage, Maria De Los\n\nSantos  Ferrer was  indicted  for possession  with intent  to\n\ndistribute   twenty  kilograms   of  cocaine,  21   U.S.C.   \n\n841(a)(1), and its possession  on board an aircraft departing\n\nfrom  the  United States,  21 U.S.C.    955.   De  Los Santos\n\nFerrer  filed a  motion to  suppress the  evidence  which the\n\ndistrict  court  granted.     The   government  appeals   the\n\nsuppression order.  We reverse.\n\n     On  March  26, 1991,  Customs agents  at the  Luis Munoz\n\nMarin International Airport in  Puerto Rico were conducting a\n\ntraining exercise  with a certified drug-sniffing canine when\n\nthe  dog alerted on three checked suitcases that had not been\n\nplanted by the agents.   The suitcases were intermingled with\n\ndomestic  and  international   luggage  in  a  baggage   area\n\nunderneath  the  American  Airlines  terminal.   The  Customs\n\nagents  removed the suitcases  from the baggage  area and ran\n\nthem through an airport  x-ray machine.  In the  meantime the\n\nsuitcases were  identified as registered to  a \"Maria Torres\"\n\nseated on board  an American Airlines flight about  to depart\n\nfor Miami.  \n\n     Customs  Agent  Marilyn  Garcia  boarded the  plane  and\n\nproceeded to the seat assigned to Maria Torres.  The seat was\n\noccupied by  a man and sitting next to him was the defendant,\n\nMaria De Los  Santos Ferrer.   Garcia approached the  couple,\n\n                             -2-\n\nidentified herself as  a Customs  officer, and  asked to  see\n\ntheir airline tickets.   The couple explained that  they were\n\nmarried and  produced airline tickets  registered to  \"Anibal\n\nTorres\" and \"Maria Torres.\"   De Los Santos Ferrer identified\n\nherself  as Maria Torres.  Affixed to her airline ticket were\n\nthree  baggage claim  checks that  corresponded to  the claim\n\nchecks on the suitcases picked out by the drug-detecting dog.\n\nThe defendant and her  husband were led off the  airplane and\n\ntaken to the Customs  enclosure area, where they were  put in\n\nseparate rooms.\n\n     After  the defendant  was  read her  Miranda rights  and\n                                                 \n\npatted down for weapons,  Customs supervisor Benjamin  Garcia\n\nasked  De  Los  Santos  Ferrer  about  the  suitcases.    The\n\ndefendant replied that the luggage did not belong to her.  An\n\nhour  or more elapsed before Agent Enrique Nieves of the Drug\n\nEnforcement   Administration  arrived.     He   informed  the\n\ndefendant that a Customs dog  had alerted authorities to  the\n\nsuitcases checked under her  name, that the luggage had  been\n\nX-rayed  and that  the X-ray  revealed packages  which Nieves\n\nbelieved contained narcotics.\n\n     Agent Nieves  then asked  for defendant's  permission to\n\nopen  the suitcases,  stating that he  would obtain  a search\n\nwarrant  if she did not consent.   De Los Santos Ferrer again\n\ndenied  ownership, telling  Agent Nieves  that she  could not\n\nconsent to a search because the luggage was not hers.  Nieves\n\n                             -3-\n\ncontinued  to  seek  the  defendant's  consent.    This  time\n\n(according to Nieves)  she nodded her head in  an affirmative\n\nmanner.  The  luggage was  then opened and  found to  contain\n\ncocaine, and the defendant was formally arrested.\n\n     De  Los Santos  Ferrer was  indicted and  thereafter she\n\nmoved to  suppress  as  evidence  the cocaine  found  in  the\n\nluggage.   At  a hearing  on the  motion before  a magistrate\n\njudge,  De Los Santos  Ferrer admitted in  her testimony that\n\nthe suitcases belonged to her.  She also  agreed that she had\n\ndisclaimed ownership of the  luggage when questioned by Agent\n\nBenjamin  Garcia  and then  again  when  questioned by  Agent\n\nNieves.   But she denied that  she ever consented to a search\n\nof  the luggage.   She  testified that  when the  luggage was\n\nopened, Nieves did so using a tool.  \n\n     The magistrate judge credited Agent Nieves' testimony on\n\nthe  issue of consent.   The magistrate judge  found that the\n\ndefendant  had  voluntarily  agreed  to the  opening  of  the\n\nsuitcases,  and he  issued a  written report to  the district\n\ncourt  recommending that  the motion  to suppress  be denied.\n\nThe defendant  then sought  review of the  magistrate judge's\n\nrecommended  report.   Based  on the  record  of the  earlier\n\nhearing, the district court reversed  and ordered suppression\n\nof  the cocaine  seized  from the  luggage  on two  principal\n\ngrounds.\n\n                             -4-\n\n     First,  the  district   court  ruled   that  the   x-ray\n\nexamination,  conducted  for criminal  investigation purposes\n\nwithout a warrant, violated the Fourth Amendment, and its use\n\nto secure consent  vitiated the consent.   Second, the  court\n\nfound that  the disclaimer  and the consent  were involuntary\n\nbecause  they  were  secured in  a  custodial  \"stationhouse\"\n\natmosphere  in which the defendant  was \"detained for over an\n\nhour, not free to leave at will and subjected to a frisk\" and\n\nto  repeated interrogation.   The  court also  criticized the\n\nagents  for  a  pattern  of abusive  behavior  in  conducting\n\nwarrantless  airport  searches  based  on  x-ray  checks  and\n\nalleged consent.\n\n     In this appeal, the government primarily argues that the\n\nx-ray  scan  was   not  a  search  subject   to  the  warrant\n\nrequirement.  It concedes that this x-ray examination was not\n\na  valid  airport  administrative  search,  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\n$124,570 U.S. Currency, 873 F.2d  1240, 1244 (9th Cir.  1989)\n                      \n\n(airport   administrative   search   exception   to   warrant\n\nrequirement   is  limited   to  searches   for   weapons  and\n\nexplosives),  but it  maintains that  there is  no reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy  in luggage checked at  an airport, at\n\nleast as to  x-ray searches.  See Katz v.  United States, 389\n                                                        \n\nU.S.  347,   361  (1967)  (Harlan,  J.,   concurring).    The\n\ngovernment  notes that luggage on the flight at issue in this\n\n                             -5-\n\ncase  was  also subject  to an  administrative search  by the\n\nAgriculture Department.\n\n     We think that the Fourth  Amendment issue is a difficult\n\none.  To  be sure, a  traveler who has  any experience  knows\n\nthat  luggage at airports is now commonly x-rayed for guns or\n\nexplosives and  that requests at  the checkpoint to  open the\n\nluggage  are not  uncommon.   At  the  same time,  these  are\n\nadministrative searches conducted  for a limited purpose  and\n\nthis limited--and  exigent--purpose  has been  the basis  for\n\nallowing the searches en masse, without a warrant and without\n\nprobable cause.   There is  at least some  basis for  concern\n\nabout the government's falling-domino approach, by which each\n\nintrusion diminishes privacy expectations  enough to permit a\n\nfurther infringement.   See Smith v. Maryland,  442 U.S. 735,\n                                             \n\n740 n.5 (1979).\n\n     In  this  case, the  second  search  was  by  x-ray  and\n\nprobable  cause to secure a warrant happened to exist; but it\n\nis not clear whether the government's diminished expectations\n\ntheory would be limited to probable  cause cases or, perhaps,\n\neven  to x-ray searches.  The government itself ought to give\n\nsome thought  to the  fact that indiscriminate  extensions of\n\nwarrantless  search  authority may  eventually  undermine the\n\ncase for legitimate  exceptions.   In all events,  we see  no\n\nreason  to  hurry  to  embrace  the  position  urged  by  the\n\ngovernment in this case, for we  think that the search may be\n\n                             -6-\n\nsustained   on   a  quite   different  ground,   namely,  the\n\ndefendant's  own admitted  disclaimer of  an interest  in the\n\nluggage.   See United States v.  Maldonado-Espinosa, 968 F.2d\n                                                   \n\n101,  103-04 (1st  Cir. 1992), cert.  denied, 113  S.Ct. 1579\n                                            \n\n(1993).\n\n     It  is  well  established   that  one  who  abandons  or\n\ndisclaims ownership of  an item forfeits any claim of privacy\n\nin its contents, and  that as to that  person the police  may\n\nsearch  the item without a  warrant.  E.g.,  United States v.\n                                                          \n\nMiller, 589 F.2d  1117, 1131 (1st  Cir. 1978), cert.  denied,\n                                                            \n\n440 U.S. 958 (1979);  United States v. Torres, 949  F.2d 606,\n                                             \n\n608  (2d  Cir.  1991)  (collecting cases).    In  this  case,\n\ndefendant's own testimony  at the hearing  was that from  the\n\noutset, and  repeatedly, she told  the agents that  she could\n\nnot  give them authority to  open the luggage  because it was\n\nnot  hers.   It  would  be  hard  to  find  a  more  explicit\n\ndisclaimer or one more certain to have occurred.\n\n     The district  court noted that Agent Nieves did not rely\n\non  the   disclaimer  but   rather  continued  to   seek  the\n\ndefendant's consent to  open the  luggage.  But  there is  no\n\nsuggestion  in the  case law  that law  enforcement officials\n\nmust actually  believe a defendant who  denies ownership, and\n\nindeed  it  is   often  the  case  that   the  disclaimer  is\n\nimmediately suspect.  E.g., United States v. Roman,  849 F.2d\n                                                  \n\n920 (5th  Cir. 1988)  (agent saw  defendant in possession  of\n\n                             -7-\n\nluggage  prior  to  defendant's  disclaimer of  knowledge  of\n\nbags);  United  States v.  Tolbert, 692 F.2d  1041 (6th  Cir.\n                                  \n\n1982) (same), cert.  denied, 464 U.S. 933  (1983).  Obviously\n                           \n\nthe  agent would  prefer to have  \"consent\" since  it carries\n\nwith  it an admission of  control or ownership  that could be\n\nuseful  at trial; but the agent's attempt to secure this more\n\nuseful ground for the search (consent) does not seem to us to\n\npreclude  reliance  upon  an  equally  well  established  one\n\n(disclaimer) made out by the facts.\n\n     Nor do we think that the disclaimer is undermined by the\n\n\"nod\"  that defendant is alleged to have given--she denied it\n\nbut the magistrate  judge found that it  had occurred--at the\n\nend of  the interview.  It  may well be that,  if a defendant\n\ndisclaims ownership of a bag but then clearly reverses ground\n\nand asserts ownership, it is too late for the officer then to\n\nsearch the bag in reliance on the earlier, but now withdrawn,\n\ndisclaimer of ownership.   But in this  case we do not  think\n\nthe simple nod, even if it occurred, was sufficiently at odds\n\nwith  the  repeated disclaimer  to require  us to  ignore the\n\ndisclaimer.\n\n     Given the original disclaimer,  it is unnecessary for us\n\nto rule  on the government's argument that  the later consent\n\nwas voluntary, although we  note that district court findings\n\non  such issues  are  not lightly  set  aside.   The  initial\n\ndisclaimer is another matter:   It occurred at the  outset of\n\n                             -8-\n\nthe  questioning well  before Agent  Nieves even  arrived and\n\nbefore  much time had  passed.  Assuming  that the atmosphere\n\nbecame coercively  oppressive, we  see no evidence  that this\n\nwas so  at the very outset.   If the district  court did mean\n\nthat this disclaimer was secured by undue pressure, we cannot\n\nsustain that ruling.\n\n     Similarly,  the allegedly  unlawful x-ray  had not  been\n\nmentioned when the disclaimer  was first made so there  is no\n\nargument   that  it  prompted,   and  thereby  infected,  the\n\ndisclaimer.  Nor is there any basis for believing that the x-\n\nray  was  a  but-for cause  of  the  detention  and that  the\n\ndetention would  not have occurred without  the x-ray search.\n\nThe  dog sniff,  which is  not itself  a search,  was lawful,\n\nUnited States v.  Place, 462  U.S. 696, 707  (1983), and  the\n                       \n\n\"alert\"--by  a  certified, narcotics-detecting  dog--provided\n\nprobable cause to  detain and ample incentive to question the\n\nholder of the  claim checks for the  luggage.  E.g.,   United\n                                                             \n\nStates v. Race, 529 F.2d 12, 15 (1st Cir. 1976).\n              \n\n     We have  considered sua sponte whether  Murray v. United\n                                                             \n\nStates, 487  U.S.  533  (1988),  warrants  a  remand  for  an\n      \n\nevidentiary hearing on  the causation issue.   In Murray, the\n                                                        \n\nSupreme Court required such a hearing because the known facts\n\nleft  it  in  doubt  whether  a  warrant-based  search  of  a\n\nwarehouse would have occurred without a prior unlawful search\n\nof  the same facility by the same  agents.  In this case, the\n\n                             -9-\n\nofficer  who  made  the  decision  to  detain  the  defendant\n\ntestified that she did not even know that an x-ray search had\n\nbeen performed  when she took  the defendant from  the plane.\n\nThat detention, the officer testified, was based upon the dog\n\nalert and match-up of claim check numbers.\n\n     Even without  that testimony, we think  that defendant's\n\ndetention here was, beyond any reasonable dispute, inevitable\n\nregardless of the x-ray.   The evidence was that the dog, who\n\nhad worked  with its handler  for several years,  \"was biting\n\nand  scratching  on  these  suitcases\"  associated  with  the\n\ndefendant.   This,  the handling  officer testified,  was the\n\nexpected response when narcotics  were present.  According to\n\nthe magistrate's report,  the agents were  in the process  of\n\ndetermining the  identity and  location of  the owner  of the\n\nluggage at the same time the luggage was being x-rayed.   The\n\ndefendant,  they learned, was on  an airplane ready to depart\n\nfrom  Puerto Rico.   Without immediate action  to detain her,\n\nthe  agents could fairly assume  that she would  be gone from\n\nthe  jurisdiction.   If  the x-ray  machine  had been  out of\n\norder, the outcome would have been identical.    \n\n     Finally, we  note that the district  court was disturbed\n\nat a pattern  it perceived of Customs and DEA  conduct at the\n\nairport:   of  dog sniffs,  followed by  x-rays, followed  by\n\nalleged  consents to  search.   See,  e.g., United  States v.\n                                                          \n\nMaldonado-Espinosa, 767 F.  Supp. 1176 (D.P.R.  1991), aff'd,\n                                                            \n\n                             -10-\n\n968 F.2d 101 (1st Cir. 1992).  The district court underscored\n\nits unhappiness  with this pattern of  conduct, discussing it\n\nboth at the beginning  and the end of the opinion.  So far as\n\nconcerns   the  warrantless   x-ray   search   for   criminal\n\nenforcement  purposes,  we  have  expressed  our  doubts  and\n\ndeclined in this case to adopt the government's position.  \n\n     The  pattern  of  alleged   consents  presents  a  quite\n\ndifferent issue.  While we appreciate the value of a probable\n\ncause decision by an  independent magistrate, true consent is\n\na well- founded basis for a search without a warrant, and the\n\ngovernment is entitled to request consent from a suspect as a\n\nlegitimate short cut.   At the same time, it  is one thing to\n\nrequest  consent and another to  seek it over  and over again\n\nwhile--as occurred  here--holding  a defendant  in  temporary\n\ndetention  for well over an  hour, with no  indication of how\n\nlong detention will  continue, and with the DEA agent raising\n\nhis voice to  the detainee  to tell her  to be  \"respectful.\"\n\nWhen the consent is conveyed by a \"nod,\" its worth is further\n\ndiminished.  \n\n     If  this  is the  pattern  of  consent  searches at  the\n\nairport, we do  not applaud it.  More to  the point, we think\n\nthat the government should  appreciate that claims of consent\n\nderived  in this fashion are likely  to be looked upon with a\n\njaundiced eye by reviewing courts.  If the  government exerts\n\nundue pressure  or improper means to  secure consent, instead\n\n                             -11-\n\nof obtaining  a warrant as it  can easily do, it  is going to\n\nlose cases.\n\n     The suppression order is  reversed and the case remanded\n                                                             \n\nfor further proceedings.\n\n                             -12-\n",

Based on  evidence  obtained\n                            \n\nthrough a warrantless search of airport luggage, Maria De Los\n\nSantos  Ferrer was  indicted  for possession  with intent  to\n\ndistribute   twenty  kilograms   of  cocaine,  21   U.S.C.   \n\n841(a)(1), and its possession  on board an aircraft departing\n\nfrom  the  United States,  21 U.S.C.    955.   De  Los Santos\n\nFerrer  filed a  motion to  suppress the  evidence  which the\n\ndistrict  court  granted.     The   government  appeals   the\n\nsuppression order.  We reverse.\n\n     On  March  26, 1991,  Customs agents  at the  Luis Munoz\n\nMarin International Airport in  Puerto Rico were conducting a\n\ntraining exercise  with a certified drug-sniffing canine when\n\nthe  dog alerted on three checked suitcases that had not been\n\nplanted by the agents.   The suitcases were intermingled with\n\ndomestic  and  international   luggage  in  a  baggage   area\n\nunderneath  the  American  Airlines  terminal.   The  Customs\n\nagents  removed the suitcases  from the baggage  area and ran\n\nthem through an airport  x-ray machine.  In the  meantime the\n\nsuitcases were  identified as registered to  a \"Maria Torres\"\n\nseated on board  an American Airlines flight about  to depart\n\nfor Miami.  \n\n     Customs  Agent  Marilyn  Garcia  boarded the  plane  and\n\nproceeded to the seat assigned to Maria Torres.  The seat was\n\noccupied by  a man and sitting next to him was the defendant,\n\nMaria De Los  Santos Ferrer.   Garcia approached the  couple,\n\n                             -2-\n\nidentified herself as  a Customs  officer, and  asked to  see\n\ntheir airline tickets.   The couple explained that  they were\n\nmarried and  produced airline tickets  registered to  \"Anibal\n\nTorres\" and \"Maria Torres.\"   De Los Santos Ferrer identified\n\nherself  as Maria Torres.  Affixed to her airline ticket were\n\nthree  baggage claim  checks that  corresponded to  the claim\n\nchecks on the suitcases picked out by the drug-detecting dog.\n\nThe defendant and her  husband were led off the  airplane and\n\ntaken to the Customs  enclosure area, where they were  put in\n\nseparate rooms.\n\n     After  the defendant  was  read her  Miranda rights  and\n                                                 \n\npatted down for weapons,  Customs supervisor Benjamin  Garcia\n\nasked  De  Los  Santos  Ferrer  about  the  suitcases.    The\n\ndefendant replied that the luggage did not belong to her.  An\n\nhour  or more elapsed before Agent Enrique Nieves of the Drug\n\nEnforcement   Administration  arrived.     He   informed  the\n\ndefendant that a Customs dog  had alerted authorities to  the\n\nsuitcases checked under her  name, that the luggage had  been\n\nX-rayed  and that  the X-ray  revealed packages  which Nieves\n\nbelieved contained narcotics.\n\n     Agent Nieves  then asked  for defendant's  permission to\n\nopen  the suitcases,  stating that he  would obtain  a search\n\nwarrant  if she did not consent.   De Los Santos Ferrer again\n\ndenied  ownership, telling  Agent Nieves  that she  could not\n\nconsent to a search because the luggage was not hers.  Nieves\n\n                             -3-\n\ncontinued  to  seek  the  defendant's  consent.    This  time\n\n(according to Nieves)  she nodded her head in  an affirmative\n\nmanner.  The  luggage was  then opened and  found to  contain\n\ncocaine, and the defendant was formally arrested.\n\n     De  Los Santos  Ferrer was  indicted and  thereafter she\n\nmoved to  suppress  as  evidence  the cocaine  found  in  the\n\nluggage.   At  a hearing  on the  motion before  a magistrate\n\njudge,  De Los Santos  Ferrer admitted in  her testimony that\n\nthe suitcases belonged to her.  She also  agreed that she had\n\ndisclaimed ownership of the  luggage when questioned by Agent\n\nBenjamin  Garcia  and then  again  when  questioned by  Agent\n\nNieves.   But she denied that  she ever consented to a search\n\nof  the luggage.   She  testified that  when the  luggage was\n\nopened, Nieves did so using a tool.  \n\n     The magistrate judge credited Agent Nieves' testimony on\n\nthe  issue of consent.   The magistrate judge  found that the\n\ndefendant  had  voluntarily  agreed  to the  opening  of  the\n\nsuitcases,  and he  issued a  written report to  the district\n\ncourt  recommending that  the motion  to suppress  be denied.\n\nThe defendant  then sought  review of the  magistrate judge's\n\nrecommended  report.   Based  on the  record  of the  earlier\n\nhearing, the district court reversed  and ordered suppression\n\nof  the cocaine  seized  from the  luggage  on two  principal\n\ngrounds.\n\n                             -4-\n\n     First,  the  district   court  ruled   that  the   x-ray\n\nexamination,  conducted  for criminal  investigation purposes\n\nwithout a warrant, violated the Fourth Amendment, and its use\n\nto secure consent  vitiated the consent.   Second, the  court\n\nfound that  the disclaimer  and the consent  were involuntary\n\nbecause  they  were  secured in  a  custodial  \"stationhouse\"\n\natmosphere  in which the defendant  was \"detained for over an\n\nhour, not free to leave at will and subjected to a frisk\" and\n\nto  repeated interrogation.   The  court also  criticized the\n\nagents  for  a  pattern  of abusive  behavior  in  conducting\n\nwarrantless  airport  searches  based  on  x-ray  checks  and\n\nalleged consent.\n\n     In this appeal, the government primarily argues that the\n\nx-ray  scan  was   not  a  search  subject   to  the  warrant\n\nrequirement.  It concedes that this x-ray examination was not\n\na  valid  airport  administrative  search,  United States  v.\n                                                         \n\n$124,570 U.S. Currency, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"522281\"><a href=\"/opinion/522281/united-states-v-124570-us-currency-appeal-of-wayne-g-campbell/\"><span class=\"volume\">873</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span>  <span class=\"page\">1240</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 1244 (9th Cir.  1989)\n                      \n\n(airport   administrative   search   exception   to   warrant\n\nrequirement   is  limited   to  searches   for   weapons  and\n\nexplosives),  but it  maintains that  there is  no reasonable\n\nexpectation of privacy  in luggage checked at  an airport, at\n\nleast as to  x-ray searches.

The\n\ngovernment  notes that luggage on the flight at issue in this\n\n                             -5-\n\ncase  was  also subject  to an  administrative search  by the\n\nAgriculture Department.\n\n     We think that the Fourth  Amendment issue is a difficult\n\none.  To  be sure, a  traveler who has  any experience  knows\n\nthat  luggage at airports is now commonly x-rayed for guns or\n\nexplosives and  that requests at  the checkpoint to  open the\n\nluggage  are not  uncommon.   At  the  same time,  these  are\n\nadministrative searches conducted  for a limited purpose  and\n\nthis limited--and  exigent--purpose  has been  the basis  for\n\nallowing the searches en masse, without a warrant and without\n\nprobable cause.   There is  at least some  basis for  concern\n\nabout the government's falling-domino approach, by which each\n\nintrusion diminishes privacy expectations  enough to permit a\n\nfurther infringement.   See Smith v. Maryland,  </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110118\"><a href=\"/opinion/110118/smith-v-maryland/\"><span class=\"volume\">442</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">735</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n                                             \n\n740 n.5 (1979).\n\n     In  this  case, the  second  search  was  by  x-ray  and\n\nprobable  cause to secure a warrant happened to exist; but it\n\nis not clear whether the government's diminished expectations\n\ntheory would be limited to probable  cause cases or, perhaps,\n\neven  to x-ray searches.  The government itself ought to give\n\nsome thought  to the  fact that indiscriminate  extensions of\n\nwarrantless  search  authority may  eventually  undermine the\n\ncase for legitimate  exceptions.   In all events,  we see  no\n\nreason  to  hurry  to  embrace  the  position  urged  by  the\n\ngovernment in this case, for we  think that the search may be\n\n                             -6-\n\nsustained   on   a  quite   different  ground,   namely,  the\n\ndefendant's  own admitted  disclaimer of  an interest  in the\n\nluggage.

In  this  case,\n\ndefendant's own testimony  at the hearing  was that from  the\n\noutset, and  repeatedly, she told  the agents that  she could\n\nnot  give them authority to  open the luggage  because it was\n\nnot  hers.   It  would  be  hard  to  find  a  more  explicit\n\ndisclaimer or one more certain to have occurred.\n\n     The district  court noted that Agent Nieves did not rely\n\non  the   disclaimer  but   rather  continued  to   seek  the\n\ndefendant's consent to  open the  luggage.  But  there is  no\n\nsuggestion  in the  case law  that law  enforcement officials\n\nmust actually  believe a defendant who  denies ownership, and\n\nindeed  it  is   often  the  case  that   the  disclaimer  is\n\nimmediately suspect.

Obviously\n                           \n\nthe  agent would  prefer to have  \"consent\" since  it carries\n\nwith  it an admission of  control or ownership  that could be\n\nuseful  at trial; but the agent's attempt to secure this more\n\nuseful ground for the search (consent) does not seem to us to\n\npreclude  reliance  upon  an  equally  well  established  one\n\n(disclaimer) made out by the facts.\n\n     Nor do we think that the disclaimer is undermined by the\n\n\"nod\"  that defendant is alleged to have given--she denied it\n\nbut the magistrate  judge found that it  had occurred--at the\n\nend of  the interview.  It  may well be that,  if a defendant\n\ndisclaims ownership of a bag but then clearly reverses ground\n\nand asserts ownership, it is too late for the officer then to\n\nsearch the bag in reliance on the earlier, but now withdrawn,\n\ndisclaimer of ownership.   But in this  case we do not  think\n\nthe simple nod, even if it occurred, was sufficiently at odds\n\nwith  the  repeated disclaimer  to require  us to  ignore the\n\ndisclaimer.\n\n     Given the original disclaimer,  it is unnecessary for us\n\nto rule  on the government's argument that  the later consent\n\nwas voluntary, although we  note that district court findings\n\non  such issues  are  not lightly  set  aside.   The  initial\n\ndisclaimer is another matter:   It occurred at the  outset of\n\n                             -8-\n\nthe  questioning well  before Agent  Nieves even  arrived and\n\nbefore  much time had  passed.  Assuming  that the atmosphere\n\nbecame coercively  oppressive, we  see no evidence  that this\n\nwas so  at the very outset.   If the district  court did mean\n\nthat this disclaimer was secured by undue pressure, we cannot\n\nsustain that ruling.\n\n     Similarly,  the allegedly  unlawful x-ray  had not  been\n\nmentioned when the disclaimer  was first made so there  is no\n\nargument   that  it  prompted,   and  thereby  infected,  the\n\ndisclaimer.  Nor is there any basis for believing that the x-\n\nray  was  a  but-for cause  of  the  detention  and that  the\n\ndetention would  not have occurred without  the x-ray search.\n\nThe  dog sniff,  which is  not itself  a search,  was lawful,\n\nUnited States v.  Place, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110979\"><a href=\"/opinion/110979/united-states-v-place/\"><span class=\"volume\">462</span>  <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">696</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 707  (1983), and  the\n                       \n\n\"alert\"--by  a  certified, narcotics-detecting  dog--provided\n\nprobable cause to  detain and ample incentive to question the\n\nholder of the  claim checks for the  luggage.  E.g.,   United\n                                                             \n\nStates v.

In Murray, the\n                                                        \n\nSupreme Court required such a hearing because the known facts\n\nleft  it  in  doubt  whether  a  warrant-based  search  of  a\n\nwarehouse would have occurred without a prior unlawful search\n\nof  the same facility by the same  agents.  In this case, the\n\n                             -9-\n\nofficer  who  made  the  decision  to  detain  the  defendant\n\ntestified that she did not even know that an x-ray search had\n\nbeen performed  when she took  the defendant from  the plane.\n\nThat detention, the officer testified, was based upon the dog\n\nalert and match-up of claim check numbers.\n\n     Even without  that testimony, we think  that defendant's\n\ndetention here was, beyond any reasonable dispute, inevitable\n\nregardless of the x-ray.   The evidence was that the dog, who\n\nhad worked  with its handler  for several years,  \"was biting\n\nand  scratching  on  these  suitcases\"  associated  with  the\n\ndefendant.   This,  the handling  officer testified,  was the\n\nexpected response when narcotics  were present.  According to\n\nthe magistrate's report,  the agents were  in the process  of\n\ndetermining the  identity and  location of  the owner  of the\n\nluggage at the same time the luggage was being x-rayed.   The\n\ndefendant,  they learned, was on  an airplane ready to depart\n\nfrom  Puerto Rico.   Without immediate action  to detain her,\n\nthe  agents could fairly assume  that she would  be gone from\n\nthe  jurisdiction.   If  the x-ray  machine  had been  out of\n\norder, the outcome would have been identical.    \n\n     Finally, we  note that the district  court was disturbed\n\nat a pattern  it perceived of Customs and DEA  conduct at the\n\nairport:   of  dog sniffs,  followed by  x-rays, followed  by\n\nalleged  consents to  search.

The district court underscored\n\nits unhappiness  with this pattern of  conduct, discussing it\n\nboth at the beginning  and the end of the opinion.  So far as\n\nconcerns   the  warrantless   x-ray   search   for   criminal\n\nenforcement  purposes,  we  have  expressed  our  doubts  and\n\ndeclined in this case to adopt the government's position.  \n\n     The  pattern  of  alleged   consents  presents  a  quite\n\ndifferent issue.  While we appreciate the value of a probable\n\ncause decision by an  independent magistrate, true consent is\n\na well- founded basis for a search without a warrant, and the\n\ngovernment is entitled to request consent from a suspect as a\n\nlegitimate short cut.   At the same time, it  is one thing to\n\nrequest  consent and another to  seek it over  and over again\n\nwhile--as occurred  here--holding  a defendant  in  temporary\n\ndetention  for well over an  hour, with no  indication of how\n\nlong detention will  continue, and with the DEA agent raising\n\nhis voice to  the detainee  to tell her  to be  \"respectful.\"\n\nWhen the consent is conveyed by a \"nod,\" its worth is further\n\ndiminished.  \n\n     If  this  is the  pattern  of  consent  searches at  the\n\nairport, we do  not applaud it.  More to  the point, we think\n\nthat the government should  appreciate that claims of consent\n\nderived  in this fashion are likely  to be looked upon with a\n\njaundiced eye by reviewing courts.  If the  government exerts\n\nundue pressure  or improper means to  secure consent, instead\n\n                             -11-\n\nof obtaining  a warrant as it  can easily do, it  is going to\n\nlose cases.\n\n     The suppression order is  reversed and the case remanded\n                                                             \n\nfor further proceedings.\n\n                             -12-\n</pre>",
