Ismalia Gutiérrez Galang, with whom the Law Offices of\nPedro E. Ortiz Álvarez, P.S.C., were on brief, for appellants.\n\n    Hector E. Calle-Ortiz for appellees.\n\n\n\n                        April 22, 2004\n\n\n\n\n                              -2-\n\f             Per Curiam.         Since 1995, Héctor Colón-Rodríguez has\n\nleased certain property, where he has operated a tourist gift shop,\n\nfrom the municipality of Rincón in Puerto Rico.                       On October 1,\n\n2000,   he   was   given    a     five-year    lease     by    the   then-municipal\n\nadministration, which was under the control of the New Progressive\n\nParty (NPP). He alleges that when the new administration came into\n\noffice, controlled by a different political party, the Popular\n\nDemocratic Party (PDP), he was harassed and false complaints were\n\nmade against him, culminating in a notice from Rincón on March 9,\n\n2002 that it was terminating his lease effective April 8, 2002\n\nbecause he had defaulted on certain lease provisions.\n\n             On June 19, 1992, Colón-Rodríguez, his gift shop (Eco-\n\nLogic Co., Inc.), and his non-profit organization (Fundación Eco-\n\nCultural, Inc.), for which he had planned to build a center next to\n\nhis store, filed suit in federal district court under 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1983,   asserting    that       the   termination      of     the    lease    violated\n\nColón-Rodríguez's         civil       rights    and      constituted         political\n\ndiscrimination      and    retaliation         against      him.     After     several\n\nextensions of time, the municipality and municipal defendants\n\nanswered the complaint on September 5, 2002.                  The matter continued\n\nin federal court, with some delay occasioned by the fact that\n\nplaintiffs' original counsel was replaced.\n\n             Impatient with the lack of progress in getting to the\n\nmerits of the controversy in federal court, the defendants did not\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\ffile a motion with the federal court to expedite proceedings but\n\ninstead filed a Puerto Rico court complaint on April 1, 2003 to\n\nevict Colón-Rodríguez from the property.           The state court set a\n\nhearing date for July 2, 2003.      The defendants did not, as best we\n\ncan tell, inform the state court of the pending federal court\n\nproceedings.\n\n           On June 20, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a motion with the\n\nfederal court to stay the state court proceedings.                On July 1,\n\n2003, before the defendants had responded, the court granted the\n\nrequested injunction. The defendants submitted their opposition to\n\nthe motion later that day, arguing that a stay was prohibited by\n\nthe 28 U.S.C. § 2283, the Anti-Injunction Act.             After realizing\n\nthat the court had already ruled, the defendants then moved for\n\nreconsideration, which the court denied on July 16, 2003.                  The\n\ndefendants   took   this   appeal   on    July    28,   2003,   arguing    the\n\ninjunction violated § 2283 and raising a new argument that a stay\n\nwas required under the doctrine of Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37\n\n(1971). Although Younger was not raised in the trial court, it may\n\nstill be raised before this court.        See Bellotti v. Baird, 428 U.S.\n\n132, 143 n.10 (1976).\n\n           There was some confusion below about which exception to\n\nthe   Anti-Injunction   Act   permitted     the   court   to    consider   the\n\napplication for injunctive relief.        The parties now agree that, at\n\na minimum, the fact that the plaintiffs brought the action under §\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\f1983 means that the case was within an exception to § 2283.\n\nMitchum v. Foster, 407 U.S. 225 (1972).    That being so, at oral\n\nargument, this court inquired of counsel what the defendants' real\n\ninterest in pursuing this appeal was.   Defendants said that their\n\nobjective is to achieve a prompt hearing on the merits of this\n\nmatter so that the status of the property can resolved.   They said\n\nthat, from their point of view, Colón-Rodríguez has created a\n\ndangerous and unsightly condition at the premises by his failure to\n\nmeet certain lease obligations.\n\n          The defendants represented to us that they have no\n\nobjection to remaining in federal court and having the federal\n\ncourt resolve the entire matter, provided that there would be a\n\nprompt resolution, at least of the issue concerning the condition\n\nof the premises.   This court then inquired of plaintiffs' counsel\n\nwhether the plaintiffs would agree to join with the defendants in\n\nasking the district court to expedite and promptly schedule this\n\nmatter.   Plaintiffs' counsel agreed.   Defendants then said that\n\nthey would voluntarily dismiss the appeal if they could get a\n\nprompt resolution in the trial court.\n\n          The parties have provided such a written agreement to\n\nthis court, the pertinent portions of which are attached as Exhibit\n\nA.   As a result, we order that the appeal be dismissed without\n\nprejudice, and the case is remanded to the district court with\n\ninstructions to expedite the resolution of this matter and to set\n\n\n                               -5-\n\fa firm trial date.   We also note that the defendants' most pressing\n\nconcern seems to be the condition of the premises and that it may\n\nbe appropriate for the district court to promptly consider that\n\nissue first.   If the defendants become concerned that they are\n\nunable to achieve a prompt resolution of this matter, they may then\n\nseek appropriate relief and raise material arguments first in the\n\ndistrict court.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -6-\n\fEXHIBIT A\n\n            Come now the parties in this appeal, the Municipality of\n\nRincón   and     Héctor   Colón   Rodríguez,    through    the    subscribing\n\nattorneys, and respectfully submit the following stipulation.\n\n            1.       Defendants'     interest     is      to     expedite the\n\n                     resolution of this controversy.             They have no\n\n                     objection to being in the federal district court,\n\n                     provided that the proceedings are expedited.\n\n            2.       Plaintiffs    agree   that    the     proceedings     be\n\n                     expedited.\n\n            3.
