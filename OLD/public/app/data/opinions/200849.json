José Antonio Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                  Torruella, Lynch and Howard,\n                         Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Neil Hoffman with whom Fredric S. Karpf and Law Offices of\nNeil Hoffman, were on brief, for appellants.\n     Jeannette Lopez De Victoria with whom Pinto-Lugo, Oliveras &\nOrtiz, P.S.C., was on brief, for appellees.\n\n\n\n                          February 12, 2004\n\f            HOWARD, Circuit Judge.           Plaintiffs Michael and Roxanne\n\nO'Connell appeal from the district court's denial of their motion\n\nto amend the complaint.          We affirm.\n\n            This lawsuit arises out of a slip-and-fall accident that\n\noccurred at the Hyatt Regency Cerromar Beach Resort and Casino in\n\nDorado, Puerto Rico on November 12, 1997.                Plaintiffs, who are\n\ncitizens of Pennsylvania, filed this action in the Pennsylvania\n\nstate court on November 9, 1999. The complaint originally named as\n\ndefendants Hyatt Corporation, Hyatt International Corporation,\n\nHyatt Hotels Corporation, and H. Group Holding, Inc. (the \"original\n\ndefendants\").\n\n            On December 28, 1999, the original defendants invoked the\n\nfederal courts' diversity jurisdiction to remove this case to the\n\nUnited   States       District    Court    for    the   Eastern   District   of\n\nPennsylvania.     See 28 U.S.C. § 1441.             Several months later, on\n\nMarch 7, 2000, the parties filed a stipulation to (1) dismiss the\n\noriginal defendants from the action, (2) amend the caption of the\n\ncomplaint to name Hyatt of Puerto Rico and Dorado Beach Hotel as\n\nthe proper defendants, and (3) transfer the case to the United\n\nStates District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. The parties\n\nalso stipulated that plaintiffs would amend the complaint to assert\n\nallegations against these new defendants within thirty days of the\n\ntransfer.       The    federal     court     in   Pennsylvania    approved   the\n\n\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fstipulation and transferred the case to the District Court of\n\nPuerto Rico on March 15, 2000.\n\n            Notwithstanding     the     stipulation,    nothing    further\n\ntranspired until November 8, 2000, when the Puerto Rico district\n\ncourt entered a scheduling order pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b).\n\nThe scheduling order required that motions to amend the pleadings\n\nhad to be filed by November 21, 2000, and that any late motions to\n\namend the pleadings would be allowed only upon a demonstration of\n\ngood cause for the delay.       Plaintiffs did not move to amend the\n\ncomplaint before the November 21, 2000 deadline expired.           Because\n\nplaintiffs did not amend the complaint, the complaint continued to\n\nassert allegations only against the original defendants.\n\n            On April 4, 2001, Hyatt Corporation, one of the original\n\ndefendants, moved to dismiss the complaint on personal jurisdiction\n\ngrounds.    See Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2).         In response, plaintiffs\n\nmoved to amend their complaint to state allegations against the new\n\ndefendants.      On March 20, 2002, the district court denied Hyatt\n\nCorporation's motion to dismiss the complaint because the original\n\ndefendants already had been dismissed pursuant to the stipulation\n\nentered prior to the case's transfer.              See Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\n41(a)(1)(ii).      In the same order, the court denied plaintiffs'\n\nmotion to amend the complaint because, inter alia, plaintiffs had\n\nflouted    the   scheduling   order    deadline   and   had   \"provided   no\n\nexplanation whatsoever for the long delay.\" The court subsequently\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fdenied    plaintiffs' motion to reconsider and entered judgment on\n\nJanuary 10, 2003.     Plaintiffs have timely appealed.\n\n           We review the denial of a motion to amend the pleadings\n\nfor an abuse of discretion and will affirm if any adequate reason\n\nfor the denial is apparent from the record.        See Acosta-Mestre v.\n\nHilton Int'l of P.R., 156 F.3d 49, 51 (1st Cir. 1998).                   In\n\ncontesting the district court's ruling, plaintiffs highlight the\n\nliberal   amendment   policy   underlying   Fed.   R.   Civ.    P.   15(a),\n\ncontending that the denial of their motion was inconsistent with\n\nthe permissive bent of this Rule.\n\n           Rule 15(a) provides that leave to amend a complaint is\n\npermitted, as a matter of course, before the opposing party has\n\nfiled a responsive pleading.     Once a responsive pleading has been\n\nfiled, subsequent amendments require court approval, and such\n\napproval is \"freely given when justice so requires.\"           See Fed. R.\n\nCiv. P. 15(a). We have often described this standard as reflecting\n\nthe \"liberal\" amendment policy underlying Rule 15.             See, e.g.,\n\nWilson v. Mendon, 294 F.3d 1, 7 n.16 (1st Cir. 2002); Mills v.\n\nMaine, 118 F.3d 37, 53 (1st Cir. 1997); USM Corp. v. GKN Fasteners\n\nLtd., 578 F.2d 21, 23 (1st Cir. 1978).\n\n           Plaintiffs focus on Rule 15(a), emphasizing the Rule's\n\npro-amendment orientation.     But plaintiffs have pinned their hopes\n\non the wrong rule.    The standard applicable here is not the \"freely\n\n\n\n\n                                  -4-\n\fgiven\" Rule 15(a) standard but the more stringent \"good cause\"\n\nstandard under Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b).\n\n            Rule 16(b) requires that the district court enter a\n\nscheduling order within 120 days of service of the complaint.            The\n\nscheduling order sets the deadlines for subsequent proceedings in\n\nthe litigation, including amending the pleadings. See Fed. R. Civ.\n\nP. 16(b)(1).   The purpose of limiting the period for amending the\n\npleadings is to assure \"that at some point both the parties and the\n\npleadings will be fixed.\"     Advisory Committee Notes to the 1983\n\nAmendments to Fed. R. Civ. P. 16(b).            The Rule does recognize,\n\nhowever, that the parties will occasionally be unable to meet these\n\ndeadlines   because   scheduling   order       deadlines   are   established\n\nrelatively early in the litigation.       See id.    Therefore, the court\n\nmay extend a scheduling order deadline on a showing \"of good cause\n\nif the [deadline] cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of\n\nthe party seeking the extension.\"        Id.\n\n            Several courts have held that Rule 16(b)'s \"good cause\"\n\nstandard, rather than Rule 15(a)'s \"freely given\" standard, governs\n\nmotions to amend filed after scheduling order deadlines. See Leary\n\nv. Daeschner, 349 F.3d 888, 906 (6th Cir. 2003); S&W Enters. v.\n\nSouthTrust Bank of Ala., 315 F.3d 533, 536 (5th Cir. 2003); Parker\n\nv. Columbia Pictures Indus., 204 F.3d 326, 340 (2d Cir. 2000); In\n\nre Milk Prods. Antitrust Litig., 195 F.3d 430, 437-38 (8th Cir.\n\n1999); Sosa v. Airprint Sys., Inc., 133 F.3d 1417, 1419 (11th Cir.\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\f1998) (per curiam); Johnson v. Mammoth Recreations, Inc., 975 F.2d\n\n604, 608 (9th Cir. 1992); cf. Riofrio Anda v. Ralston Purina Co.,\n\n959 F.2d 1149, 1154-55 (1st Cir. 1992) (affirming denial of motion\n\nto amend filed after expiration of scheduling order deadline\n\nbecause allowing amendment would be inconsistent with purposes of\n\nRule 16(b)). The rationale is that application of the \"good cause\"\n\nstandard      preserves the integrity and effectiveness of Rule 16(b)\n\nscheduling orders.         See Sosa, 133 F.3d at 1419.\n\n            \"In an era of burgeoning case loads and thronged dockets,\n\neffective case management has become an essential tool for handling\n\ncivil litigation.\"         Towers Ventures, Inc. v. Westfield, 296 F.3d\n\n43, 45 (1st Cir. 2002).          Rule 16 provides the district courts with\n\nmany of the devices necessary to manage its docket.                See Rosario-\n\nDiaz v. Gonzalez, 140 F.3d 312, 315 (1st Cir. 1998).                      For Rule\n\n16(b) to operate effectively, litigants cannot be permitted to\n\ntreat a scheduling order as a \"frivolous piece of paper idly\n\nentered,    which    can    be    cavalierly     disregarded    without    peril.\"\n\nJohnson,    975   F.2d     at    610    (internal   citations    and   quotations\n\nomitted).      As we observed in Riofrio Anda, 959 F.2d at 1155,\n\nliberally granting motions to amend the pleadings--filed after a\n\nparty   has    disregarded        the    scheduling    order    deadline--would\n\neffectively \"nullif[y] the purpose of Rule 16(b)(1).\"\n\n            Unlike    Rule       15(a)'s    \"freely   given\"    standard,    which\n\nfocuses mostly on the bad faith of the moving party and the\n\n\n                                           -6-\n\fprejudice to the opposing party, see Foman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178,\n\n182 (1962), Rule 16(b)'s \"good cause\" standard emphasizes the\n\ndiligence of the party seeking the amendment.          See Rosario-Diaz,\n\n140 F.3d at 315; accord Leary, 349 F.3d at 906; Parker, 204 F.3d at\n\n340.   Prejudice to the opposing party remains relevant but is not\n\nthe    dominant   criterion.     See    Johnson,    975   F.2d   at     609.\n\n\"[I]ndifference\" by the moving party \"seal[s] off this avenue of\n\nrelief\"   irrespective   of    prejudice   because     such   conduct     is\n\nincompatible with the showing of diligence necessary to establish\n\ngood cause.   Rosario-Diaz, 140 F.3d at 315.       We review the district\n\ncourt's refusal to extend a Rule 16(b) scheduling order for good\n\ncause under an abuse of discretion standard.         See Vulcan Tools of\n\nP.R. v. Makita U.S.A., Inc., 23 F.3d 564, 565 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n           Plaintiffs suggest that, \"due to circumstances not within\n\n[their] control . . . the amended Civil Action was never filed by\n\nthe filing deadline.\"     While plaintiffs are not altogether clear\n\non what stopped them from timely moving to amend, they appear to\n\nblame the error on a failure of communication between local counsel\n\nin Puerto Rico and lead counsel in Pennsylvania.          Under the facts\n\nof this case, this excuse does not establish good cause.                 Cf.\n\nRosario-Diaz, 140 F.3d at 315 (\"Attorneys represent clients, and,\n\nas a general rule, an attorney's blunder binds her client.\").\n\n           Plaintiffs stipulated that they would seek to amend the\n\ncomplaint to include allegations against the new defendants within\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fthirty days of the transfer.      Plaintiffs were thus aware of their\n\nobligation to move to amend. Nevertheless, they waited over a year\n\nafter the transfer and five months after the scheduling order\n\ndeadline to act.   Such a long and unexplained delay vindicates the\n\ndistrict court's conclusion that plaintiffs were not diligently\n\npursuing this litigation.         See, e.g., Leary, 349 F.3d at 908\n\n(affirming district court's refusal to find good cause where\n\nplaintiff was \"obviously aware of the claim for many months\" but\n\nfailed to move to amend the complaint until defendant moved for\n\nsummary judgment); Sosa, 133 F.3d at 1419 (affirming district\n\ncourt's refusal to find good cause where \"information supporting\n\nthe   proposed   amendment   to   the    complaint   was   available   [to\n\nplaintiff] even before she filed suit\"); Johnson, 975 F.2d at 609\n\n(affirming district court's refusal to find good cause where\n\nplaintiff knew that it had named the wrong party but failed to\n\namend complaint within the scheduling order deadline).\n\n           Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -8-\n\f",

Several months later, on March 7, 2000, the parties filed a stipulation to (1) dismiss the original defendants from the action, (2) amend the caption of the complaint to name Hyatt of Puerto Rico and Dorado Beach Hotel as the proper defendants, and (3) transfer the case to the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.

We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This lawsuit arises out of a slip-and-fall accident that occurred at the Hyatt Regency Cerromar Beach Resort and Casino in Dorado, Puerto Rico on November 12, 1997. Plaintiffs, who are citizens of Pennsylvania, filed this action in the Pennsylvania state court on November 9, 1999. The complaint originally named as defendants Hyatt Corporation, Hyatt International Corporation, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, and H. Group Holding, Inc. (the \"original defendants\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On December 28, 1999, the original defendants invoked the federal courts' diversity jurisdiction to remove this case to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1441. Several months later, on March 7, 2000, the parties filed a stipulation to (1) dismiss the original defendants from the action, (2) amend the caption of the complaint to name Hyatt of Puerto Rico and Dorado Beach Hotel as the proper defendants, and (3) transfer the case to the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico. The parties also stipulated that plaintiffs would amend the complaint to assert allegations against these new defendants within thirty days of the transfer. The federal court in Pennsylvania approved the stipulation and transferred the case to the District Court of Puerto Rico on March 15, 2000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Notwithstanding the stipulation, nothing further transpired until November 8, 2000, when the Puerto Rico district court entered a scheduling order pursuant to Fed. R.Civ.P. 16(b). The scheduling order required that motions to amend the pleadings had to be filed by November 21, 2000, and that any late motions to amend the pleadings would be allowed only upon a demonstration of good cause for the delay. Plaintiffs did not move to amend the complaint before the November 21, 2000 deadline expired. Because plaintiffs did not amend the complaint, the complaint continued to assert allegations only against the original defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 4, 2001, Hyatt Corporation, one of the original defendants, moved to dismiss the complaint on personal jurisdiction grounds. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 12(b)(2). In response, plaintiffs moved to amend their complaint to state allegations against the new defendants. On March 20, 2002, the district court denied Hyatt Corporation's motion to dismiss the complaint because the original defendants already had been dismissed pursuant to the stipulation entered prior to the case's transfer. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 41(a)(1)(ii). In the same order, the court denied plaintiffs' motion to amend the complaint because, <i>inter alia,</i> plaintiffs had flouted the scheduling order deadline and had \"provided no explanation whatsoever for the long delay.\" The court subsequently denied plaintiffs' motion to reconsider and entered judgment on January 10, 2003. Plaintiffs have timely appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the denial of a motion to amend the pleadings for an abuse of discretion and will affirm if any adequate reason for the denial is apparent from the record. <i>See Acosta-Mestre v. Hilton Int'l of P.R.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198100\"><a href=\"/opinion/198100/acosta-mestre-v-hilton-international/\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 51 (1st Cir.1998). In contesting the district court's ruling, plaintiffs highlight the liberal amendment policy underlying Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a), contending that the denial of their motion was inconsistent with the permissive bent of this Rule.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 15(a) provides that leave to amend a complaint is permitted, as a matter of course, before the opposing party has filed a responsive pleading. Once a responsive pleading has been filed, subsequent amendments require court approval, and such approval is \"freely given when justice so requires.\" <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(a). We have often described this standard as reflecting the \"liberal\" amendment policy underlying Rule 15. <i>See, e.g., Wilson v. Mendon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200002\"><a href=\"/opinion/200002/wilson-v-town-of-mendon/\"><span class=\"volume\">294</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 n. 16 (1st Cir.2002); <i>Mills v.

But plaintiffs have pinned their hopes on the wrong rule. The standard applicable here is not the \"freely given\" Rule 15(a) standard but the more stringent \"good cause\" standard under Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Rule 16(b) requires that the district court enter a scheduling order within 120 days of service of the complaint. The scheduling order sets the deadlines for subsequent proceedings in the litigation, including amending the pleadings. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b)(1). The purpose of limiting the period for amending the pleadings is to assure \"that at some point both the parties and the pleadings will be fixed.\" Advisory Committee Notes to the 1983 Amendments to Fed.R.Civ.P. 16(b). The Rule does recognize, however, that the parties will occasionally be unable to meet these deadlines because scheduling order deadlines are established relatively early in the litigation. <i>See id.</i> Therefore, the court may extend a scheduling order deadline on a showing \"of good cause if the [deadline] cannot reasonably be met despite the diligence of the party seeking the extension.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several courts have held that Rule 16(b)'s \"good cause\" standard, rather than Rule 15(a)'s \"freely given\" standard, governs motions to amend filed after scheduling order deadlines. <i>See Leary v. Daeschner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784197\"><a href=\"/opinion/784197/mary-elizabeth-leary-and-glenda-h-williams-v-stephen-daeschner/\"><span class=\"volume\">349</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">888</span></a></span>, 906 (6th Cir.2003); <i>S &amp; W Enters. v.

The rationale is that application of the \"good cause\" standard preserves the integrity and effectiveness of Rule 16(b) scheduling orders. <i>See Sosa,</i> 133 F.3d at 1419.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"In an era of burgeoning case loads and thronged dockets, effective case management has become an essential tool for handling civil litigation.\" <i>Tower Ventures, Inc. v.
