José A. Fusté, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                       Boudin, Chief Judge,\n                      Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n                Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n     Laura Maldonado Rodríguez for appellant Geraldo Mescual-Cruz.\n     Guillermo A. Macari-Grillo for appellant Nelson Mescual-Cruz.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nH.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, Sonia I. Torres-Pabón,\nAssistant United States Attorney, Chief, Criminal Division, and\nGermán A. Rieckehoff, Assistant United States Attorney, were on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n                           October 15, 2004\n\n\n\n\n      *\n      Of the    Northern    District     of   California,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.       This is an appeal from denials of\n\nmotions to withdraw guilty pleas which involve the law on package\n\npleas.\n\n           Defendants Geraldo Mescual-Cruz (Geraldo) and Nelson\n\nMescual-Cruz (Nelson), who are brothers, along with four co-\n\ndefendants pled guilty to federal drug conspiracy charges on April\n\n8, 2002.    The pleas were part of a package deal, that is, the\n\ngovernment's offer was contingent on all defendants entering plea\n\nagreements. Sometimes these are referred to as \"wired\" pleas, that\n\nis, two or more pleas are linked.            The package deal was reached\n\nlate in the afternoon on the first day of trial, after jury\n\nimpanelment in the morning, but before witnesses were presented.\n\nEarlier pre-trial plea negotiations had not succeeded in reaching\n\nan agreement.\n\n           This Circuit's case law requires particular care be\n\nexercised both by the government and by the court in package guilty\n\nplea situations due to certain risks inherent in package pleas\n\nwhich could affect the voluntariness of the plea. United States v.\n\nAbbott, 241 F.3d 29, 34 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Sanchez-\n\nBarreto, 93 F.3d 17, 23 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v. Martinez-\n\nMolina, 64 F.3d 719, 733 (1st Cir. 1995); United States v. Daniels,\n\n821 F.2d 76, 80 (1st Cir. 1987).           The district court, informed by\n\nthe   government   that   this   was   a    package   deal   situation,   had\n\ncontinued the trial at the request of defense counsel to give time\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\ffor negotiations.     The court was informed that the negotiations\n\nwere successful and took the pleas.     The court, at the Rule 11\n\ncolloquy, asked some questions individually of each defendant and\n\nsome of the group.    Satisfied that the pleas were voluntary, the\n\ncourt accepted the pleas from all defendants.\n\n          Over two months later, Geraldo filed two motions to\n\nwithdraw his pleas.    He asserted other grounds than that the plea\n\nwas part of a package deal, but did say he had felt pressured.\n\nNelson, Geraldo's brother, also filed a motion to withdraw.    That\n\nmotion also did not rely on the package nature of the deal.    Both\n\nmotions alleged a different sort of pressure stemming from related\n\nmurder charges pending against Nelson and Geraldo in Puerto Rico\n\ncourt.   The Commonwealth charge had not been resolved when the\n\ndefendants pled guilty on April 8, 2002, to the federal charges.\n\nThe defendants had unsuccessfully argued for postponement of the\n\nfederal trial until the Commonwealth murder charges were resolved\n\n(eventually they were acquitted).\n\n          The court denied both motions to withdraw after a hearing\n\nin which each defendant declined the opportunity to testify.\n\nNeither defendant argued that the package nature of the plea deal\n\nput them under such pressure that their pleas were not voluntary.\n\nThat argument is made for the first time on this appeal from the\n\ndenials of the motions to withdraw.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -3-\n\f          Both argue that it was plain error for the district court\n\nto fail to perform a more searching inquiry into whether the\n\npackage plea had been entered into voluntarily.      They ask this\n\ncourt to remand the case to allow them to withdraw their guilty\n\npleas and proceed to trial or, in the alternative, to require the\n\ndistrict court to hold an evidentiary hearing on the voluntariness\n\nof their guilty pleas.   Finally, Geraldo argues that the district\n\ncourt's failure to have the interpreter translate his allocution\n\nstatements into English violated the Jones Act, 48 U.S.C. § 864,\n\nand the Court Reporter Act, 28 U.S.C. § 753(b), and effectively\n\ndeprived him of his right to allocution.\n\n          We find that the district court did not commit plain\n\nerror in denying the motions to withdraw, and the Jones and Court\n\nReporter Acts errors were harmless.   We affirm.\n\n                                 I.\n\n          Geraldo and Nelson are brothers.     At the time of the\n\nplea, they were 32 and 30 respectively.    On August 30, 2001, the\n\ngrand jury returned an indictment against Geraldo and Nelson and\n\nseven other co-defendants.   Count One charged them with conspiracy\n\nto possess with intent to distribute in excess of one kilogram of\n\nheroin, five kilograms of cocaine, five kilograms of cocaine base,\n\nand in excess of fifty pounds of marijuana, in violation of 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1) and 846.    Count Two of the indictment sought\n\nforfeiture under 18 U.S.C. § 982.\n\n\n                                -4-\n\f          On September 12, 2001, Geraldo and Nelson were arrested,\n\npursuant to an arrest warrant issued on August 30, 2001. On\n\nSeptember 25, 2001, Geraldo and Nelson pled not guilty to both\n\ncounts of the indictment.    The court set a trial date of April 8,\n\n2002, and the jury trial was set to begin for Geraldo and Nelson,\n\nand four other co-defendants, Nelson Delgado-Vazquez, Juan A.\n\nTorres, Yazugui Alvarado-Maldonado, and Angel Muniz-De Jesus.\n\n          The morning the trial started, counsel for all of the\n\ndefendants approached the prosecutor and asked if the government\n\nwould extend a plea offer.   The prosecutor had made an earlier plea\n\noffer, but it had expired on April 1, 2002.   The government said it\n\nwould not simply extend the old offer; it made a new offer which\n\nincreased the length of the sentences and made any plea contingent\n\non it being a package deal.\n\n          Apparently the court was told there were negotiations and\n\ndid not resume the trial immediately after the lunch break.   Later\n\nthat afternoon at 5:00 pm, the court noted that it had interrupted\n\nthe trial to permit negotiations. One of the defense counsel asked\n\nto delay further because he was still explaining the pleas to his\n\nclient.   At that point, two defendants, Muniz and Alvarado, had\n\ntendered pleas.   The court indicated that it would take those two\n\npleas and resume trial in the morning as to the other four\n\ndefendants.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\f            When defense counsel asked for more time, the court asked\n\nwhy counsel had not considered all this before trial.            Counsel for\n\nTorres said they had considered it before that day and that he had\n\nbrought the offer to his client several weeks before.            Counsel for\n\nDelgado then said, \"I think there is a reasonable guarantee that if\n\nwe wait for another ten minutes everyone will plea[d].\"                   The\n\ngovernment then put on the record that its earlier plea offer had\n\nexpired on April 1 and the new offer to each defendant was\n\ncontingent on it being a package deal.           This was the first time\n\nthat the court was informed of the package nature of the plea.\n\nCounsel for Geraldo and Nelson said nothing.\n\n            The court granted the extra time, telling the defendants\n\nthat they should know nobody was forcing them and no one could\n\nforce them to plead guilty.       After that break (the record does not\n\nindicate its duration) the court was presented with guilty pleas\n\nfrom all defendants.      Each of the defendants was present.\n\n            The court proceeded to take the defendants' guilty pleas,\n\ninforming    the    defendants   that   it   would   have   to   ask   several\n\nquestions to determine whether the \"plea of guilty is done with\n\nknowledge of consequences, aware of the fact that you are waiving\n\na number of rights.\"         The court then addressed each defendant\n\nindividually in turn, asking questions concerning the defendant's\n\ncompetency     to    plead    guilty,     his   satisfaction       with   his\n\nrepresentation, and whether he had ample opportunity to discuss\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fwith his attorney the implications of his guilty plea.              The court\n\nreceived affirmative answers from both Nelson and Geraldo.\n\n          After being satisfied that each defendant was competent\n\nto plead guilty, the court addressed the defendants as a group.              It\n\nasked questions concerning whether they understood the rights\n\nafforded to them under the Constitution, the rights which they were\n\ngiving up by pleading guilty.          Having discussed those matters, the\n\ncourt asked whether each still wanted to plead guilty and received\n\nan affirmative response.        The court asked each whether he had seen\n\nthe indictment, and received affirmative answers.\n\n          The    court        once     again   addressed    the     defendants\n\nindividually    to    explain    the    charges   against   each,    what    the\n\ngovernment would have to prove, and the possible sentence that each\n\nmight receive.       The defendants affirmed that they understood.\n\n          The court addressed the group as a whole and asked, \"Has\n\nanyone threatened you or forced you in any form or fashion or\n\ninduced you to plead guilty in this case?\" (Emphasis added).                Each\n\nanswered no.\n\n          Once       again,     the    court   addressed    each    defendant\n\nindividually to discuss the specifics of each plea agreement and\n\nthe facts to which each defendant was stipulating.                  The court\n\nconfirmed individually that each had done what he was accused of\n\ndoing.   The court then turned to the defendants as a group and\n\nasked, \"Has anybody made any promises to any one of you to induce\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fyou to plea?\" (Emphasis added).    All defendants answered no.   The\n\nfinal question asked by the court was \"[is there] any reason why\n\nthese pleas should not be accepted?\"     All attorneys answered no.\n\nAfter ascertaining from the prosecutor that she had the necessary\n\nevidence to proceed to trial, the court accepted the pleas.\n\n          On June 28, 2002, over two months after the guilty plea\n\nwas accepted, Geraldo filed a pro se request for withdrawal of his\n\nguilty plea.   On July 19, 2002, this motion was followed by a\n\nverified motion to withdraw the guilty plea.        Nelson filed a\n\nverified motion to withdraw his guilty plea on July 16, 2002.    The\n\ngovernment responded in opposition to both on July 31, 2002.\n\n          The thrust of Geraldo's motion to withdraw his plea was\n\nthat he felt pressured by the prosecution's intent to obtain a life\n\nsentence because Geraldo was tied to three murders in the course of\n\nthe conspiracy. The motion implied that the subject of the murders\n\nhad come up at the last minute.     On March 6, 2002, the government\n\ngave notice that in its case in chief it would try to prove the\n\ninvolvement of Geraldo (and others) in three murders.    However, on\n\nMarch 19, the government gave notice it would not try to tie him to\n\ntwo of the murders, but would introduce evidence tying Geraldo to\n\nthe murder of Carlos Maldonado Berrios.      Geraldo was charged in\n\nPuerto Rico court with that murder.       In the plea negotiations\n\nbefore trial, the government said it would not negotiate a term of\n\nimprisonment below 19 years.   The plea offer at the time of trial\n\n\n                                  -8-\n\fwas that the government would recommend 20 years.                    The motion\n\nreferred to \"the pressure he was subject to as the exposure was to\n\na life sentence.\"        The motion never mentioned pressure from the\n\npackage plea.\n\n          The government's opposition to the motion responded to\n\nGeraldo's argument and said both allegations were untrue.                    It\n\npointed out that Geraldo had, on the drug conspiracy charges alone,\n\nalways faced a potential life sentence, regardless of the murder.\n\nThe prosecution also pointed out that there was no surprise -- it\n\nsaid that it made clear within three weeks of indictment it would\n\nseek to introduce evidence of the murders. The prosecution pointed\n\nout that the timing of the motion to withdraw was immediately after\n\nGeraldo was acquitted of the murder at trial in the local court and\n\nthat the defendant merely wanted a second bite at the apple in\n\nfederal court.\n\n          Nelson's motion to withdraw and the government's response\n\nto it were similar to Geraldo's.               Nelson too argued that the\n\n\"pressure . . . was extraordinary as a drug conspiracy case had\n\nturned into a drug related murder case with a very real exposure of\n\na life sentence.\"        Nelson also made no allegations of pressures\n\nassociated with the package nature of the plea.\n\n          The    court    held   a   hearing    on   the   motions    for   both\n\ndefendants on August 14, 2002.             When asked to give the core\n\nargument for withdrawal, Nelson's counsel informed the court,\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\f            [H]e feels that 20 years for his plea is too much time.\n            He has told me that he did go for it because he felt at\n            that time that he could not do anything else because he\n            was here and he felt that he had no other choice except\n            to plead guilty.\n\nAs to the murder, the counsel stated, \"that was one of the issues\n\nthroughout this case trying to make a plea because we had evidence\n\nin his case that there could be, you know, evidence as to murders.\"\n\nAs the court correctly pointed out, Nelson's plea did not include\n\nany admissions as to murder.        The plea only held him responsible\n\nfor the drug charges.   In response to whether Nelson was trying to\n\nargue that he was innocent of the drug charges, the counsel\n\nreplied, \"no, your Honor.\"        The court then summed up Nelson's\n\nargument:    \"He is simply saying that [he] took too much time, if\n\nyou will, by way of a recommendation because of the pressures of an\n\nimpending trial.\" The court continued, \"[s]o basically this is it.\n\nIt was too much time [to serve] and it was a lot of pressure and\n\nthat is too much drugs basically.\"       Nelson presented no evidence,\n\nand he chose not to testify.\n\n            Geraldo's   counsel      made   similar     arguments.     He\n\ncharacterized Geraldo's objection as, \"[b]asically it is too much\n\ntime for the amount of drugs that he dealt with.       That is basically\n\nhis   point.\"    Geraldo's   plea    agreement   did   not   contain   any\n\nadmissions as to murder, and he also said he did not wish to\n\ntestify.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f          The court found that there was no fair and just reason to\n\nallow withdrawal of the guilty pleas. In the plea agreements there\n\nwere no adjustments for murder or for weapons possession and the\n\ndefendants pled guilty only to the drug charges. The court stated,\n\n\"[u]nder these circumstances, I do think that there is nothing on\n\nthis record to suggest . . . that these pleas were involuntarily\n\nentered and there is no reason for me to consider anything other\n\nthan going ahead with sentencing in due time.\"   In a written order,\n\nthe court repeated this assertion and stated, \"[w]hen their pleas\n\nwere taken, they did it voluntarily and aware of what they were\n\ndoing.   No suspicion was alerted to the court.      Even more, the\n\ncourt asked them if there was any other reason for them not to\n\nplead, and they answered in the negative.\"\n\n          On November 21, 2002, both Geraldo and Nelson were\n\nsentenced to 235 months in prison and no fine.       They were also\n\nsentenced to serve a five year term of supervised release, and the\n\ncourt imposed a special monetary assessment of $100.\n\n                                 II.\n\nInvoluntariness of the Plea\n\n          After the district court has accepted the plea and prior\n\nto the defendant's sentencing, the district court should liberally\n\nallow withdrawal of guilty pleas for any \"fair and just reason.\"\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 11(d)(2)(B).   Once the district court has ruled on\n\nthe defendant's motion to withdraw the guilty plea, however, the\n\n\n                                -11-\n\fstandard    of    appellate    review    is    for    abuse   of    discretion      on\n\npreserved issues.        United States v. Daniels, 821 F.2d 76, 78 (1st\n\nCir. 1987).       Still, that discretion may be limited where a core\n\nconcern such as voluntariness is raised and preserved.                        United\n\nStates v. Abbott, 241 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir. 2001).                         Here, the\n\ndefendants do not get the benefit of an abuse of discretion\n\nstandard of review, because they did not raise the issue of the\n\npackage nature of the deal before the district court. Accordingly,\n\nthe review is for plain error.          United States v. Vonn, 535 U.S. 55,\n\n59 (2002).\n\n            An    unobjected-to    error       in    the   Rule    11   colloquy    is\n\nreversible error only upon a showing of plain error. Id. at 63.\n\nSince the Supreme Court's decision in 2002 in Vonn, the defendant's\n\nfailure    to    raise   the   objection       in   the    trial   court    has    two\n\nconsequences. First, it is defendant's burden to satisfy the plain\n\nerror rule.      It is not the government's burden to show any error\n\nwas harmless.      Second, the reviewing court may consider the entire\n\nrecord when assessing the effect of any error on substantial\n\nrights.    Id. at 74.\n\n            To satisfy its burden, the defendant must show four\n\nthings:    1) an error occurred, 2) the error was clear or obvious,\n\n3) it affected the defendant's substantial rights, and 4) it\n\nseriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of\n\njudicial proceedings. United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732-35\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\f(1993); United States v. Gandia-Maysonet, 227 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.\n\n2000). There is no contention that the court's Rule 11 inquiry was\n\ninsufficient save for these being package pleas.\n\n          In package plea arrangements, the prosecutor offers a\n\nbenefit or detriment to all (the defendant and third parties) in\n\norder to persuade the entire group of defendants to plead guilty.\n\nThese types of arrangements are not per se involuntary.      Still,\n\npackage plea deals raise at least two types of risks.   The first is\n\nthat a defendant is coerced by co-defendants to plead guilty\n\ninvoluntarily.   One defendant may be coerced into pleading guilty\n\nby a co-defendant who believes he is getting a good deal under the\n\npackage deal.    United States v. Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d 719, 732-\n\n33 (1st Cir. 1995).     The second is that there may be a family\n\nrelationship between two defendants which leads one defendant to\n\ninvoluntarily sacrifice his own best interests for those of a\n\nfamily member (or perhaps both family members to involuntarily\n\nsacrifice themselves) in a belief that the package deal will\n\n\n\n\n                                -13-\n\fbenefit the other.1     Abbott, 241 F.3d at 33; Daniels, 821 F.2d at\n\n79.\n\n          As to this second risk, there is a distinction to be\n\ndrawn.    The concern of the law is for voluntariness.            \"If a\n\ndefendant elects to sacrifice himself [to protect someone close to\n\nhim] that is his choice, and he cannot reverse it after he is\n\ndissatisfied     with   his   sentence,   or   with   other   subsequent\n\ndevelopments.\"    United States v. Buckley, 847 F.2d 991, 1000 n.6\n\n(1st Cir. 1988)(quoting Kent v. United States, 272 F.2d 795, 798\n\n(1st Cir. 1959)).\n\n          On the other side of the coin from these risks, package\n\nplea situations present the possibility of manipulation of the\n\n\n\n      1\n       Earlier, the Supreme Court in a footnote raised an issue of\nwhether the \"offer during plea bargaining of adverse or lenient\ntreatment for some person other than the accused\" could render an\nindividual's plea involuntary.    See Bordenkircher v. Hayes, 434\nU.S. 357, 365 n.8 (1978). This circuit, along with several others,\nhas since held that such arrangements do not render the plea\ninvoluntary. See United States v. Buckley, 847 F.2d 991, 1000 n.6\n(1st Cir. 1988) (rejecting the defendant's argument that an\nagreement promising lenient treatment of a pleading defendant's\nfamily member is substantively unfair); United States v. Tursi, 576\nF.2d 396, 398 (1st Cir. 1978) (allowing defendant's plea to be tied\nto the prosecutor's recommendation of a lighter sentence for the\ndefendant's son, when defendant was advised of the consequences of\npleading guilty and was counseled that any recommendation made by\nthe prosecution regarding the son's sentence would in no way bind\nthe court); see also United States v. Vest, 125 F.3d 676, 678-79\n(8th Cir. 1997); United States v. Marquez, 909 F.2d 738, 741-42\n(2nd Cir. 1990); United States v. Morrow, 914 F.2d 608, 613-14 (4th\nCir. 1990); Politte v. United States, 852 F.2d 924, 929-30 (7th\nCir. 1988); United States v. Castello, 724 F.2d 813, 814-15 (9th\nCir. 1984); United States v. Diaz, 733 F.2d 371, 374-75 (5th Cir.\n1984).\n\n                                  -14-\n\fsystem: one defendant obtains a benefit for a co-defendant and then\n\nmoves to withdraw his own plea, the benefit having been given.\n\nDaniels, 821 F.2d at 79.              Benefits accrue to the individual\n\ndefendants      involved,    from    both    the   traditional    prosecutorial\n\nbargaining chips and the elimination of the dilemma where one co-\n\ndefendant is pressured to plead by the fear that another co-\n\ndefendant will plead and then testify against him.                In the package\n\nplea situation, defendants can be confident that all co-defendants\n\nare pleading guilty.         Here, each defendant received a benefit of\n\navoiding the risk of a life sentence.\n\n             This circuit has crafted a two-part rule in package\n\nguilty   plea    situations     to    ensure     voluntariness.      First,   the\n\nprosecution should inform the trial court before the Rule 11\n\ncolloquy that the plea is a package deal so that the court is aware\n\nof the situation. Second, the court's ensuing colloquy should show\n\nsensitivity     to   the    issue    of   voluntariness   in   light   of   those\n\npressures.    Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d at 733.            We have not, though,\n\nmandated that extra procedures be followed, only that the court\n\nshould assess voluntariness with an eye to the special situation.2\n\n\n     2\n       The Government has confessed error and is not defending the\ndistrict court's ruling. The court of appeals is not obligated to\naccept legal propositions \"even where the parties are agreed,\nmerely because there is no adversary dispute or presentation on the\nparticular issue.\"    Computervision Corp. v. Comm'r of Internal\nRevenue, 164 F.3d 73, 75 (1st Cir. 1999); United States v. Tulloch,\n380 F.3d 8, 11 n.2 (1st Cir. 2004). When determining whether to\naddress conceded issues, pertinent considerations include: 1)\nwhether the issue is recurrent so that decision would give guidance\n\n                                          -15-\n\fCf.   United   States   v.   Holland,   117   F.3d   589,   594   (D.C.   Cir.\n\n1997)(recognizing that \"wired\" pleas can be coercive, but refusing\n\nto mandate a special voluntariness inquiry by the district court\n\nwhen faced with a wired plea)(citing United States v. Farley, 72\n\nF.3d 158, 163 (D.C. Cir. 1995)).3\n\n           The greatest risk comes when the government has not\n\ninformed the court that the plea is part of a package deal.               Where\n\nwe have reversed and vacated such pleas, it has been most often\n\nwhen the prosecution failed to make the disclosure to the trial\n\ncourt.    Abbott, 241 F.3d at 33-35; Daniels, 821 F.2d at 79-81.\n\nHere there is no doubt that the trial court knew the deal was a\n\n\n\nto the district courts, 2) whether it would be unseemly to accept,\neven arguendo, a mistaken legal proposition and reason from it to\ndecide the case, and 3) whether the issues are technical and\ncomplex and not explored carefully in existing decisions so that\nadversary briefing would be critical. See Computervision Corp.,\n164 F.3d at 75; Tulloch, 380 F.3d at 11 n.2. In applying these\nconsiderations to the case at hand, this court is not obligated to\naccept, and we do not accept, the government's confession of error\nwhich is based on the notion that there are mechanical extra steps\nwhich must be taken in order for a package plea Rule 11 colloquy to\nresult in a voluntary plea.\n      3\n       Decisions of other circuits have referred to the special\ncare or inquiry that must be taken to determine voluntariness when\npleas involve leniency or linkage to a third person. See United\nStates v. Morrow, 914 F.2d 608, 613-14 (4th Cir. 1990)(noting that\n\"[s]pecial care must be taken to determine the voluntariness of the\nplea in [package plea] circumstances\" and finding no fault in the\ndistrict court's determination that the package plea was entered\ninto voluntarily when the defendant answered that no one had\nthreatened, persuaded, or induced him into pleading guilty, no one\nhad made any promises of leniency other than those contained in the\nplea agreement, and the written plea agreement contained the entire\nplea agreement in the case).\n\n                                   -16-\n\fpackage deal.   It was told so by the prosecution in the presence of\n\ndefendants and their counsel.    We reject the defendants' argument\n\nthat they are entitled to reversal because the government did not\n\nformally announce at the Rule 11 colloquy itself again that this\n\nwas a package deal situation.\n\n          The question of the adequacy of the court's inquiry on\n\nvoluntariness is a bit closer.   We review that question in light of\n\nthe risks inherent in package deals and the plain error standard of\n\nreview.   We need not answer the question of whether the rather\n\nspartan colloquy would have been adequate if the package plea issue\n\nhad been preserved by defendants.       The court did not ask a direct\n\nquestion about voluntariness and did not explore whether the nature\n\nof the package deal impaired the voluntariness of any of the pleas.\n\nA more direct inquiry might have avoided this appeal.\n\n          The court did ask the defendants \"[h]as anyone threatened\n\nyou or forced you in any form or fashion or induced you to plead\n\nguilty in this case\" and \"[h]as anybody made any promises to any\n\none of you to induce you to plea?\"      To both of these questions the\n\ndefendants answered no.    Additionally, at the end of the colloquy,\n\nthe court asked whether there was \"any reason why these pleas\n\nshould not be accepted?\"    All counsel for the defendants answered\n\nno.\n\n          If there were pressures from co-defendants or from the\n\nfraternal relationship that led to involuntariness, Nelson and\n\n\n                                 -17-\n\fGeraldo had adequate opportunity to say so.          To the contrary, the\n\ndefendants' answers to the court's questions indicate that they\n\npled guilty of their own volition, fully aware of the rights they\n\nwere relinquishing and the charges they were accepting.                   The\n\ndefendants' \"declarations in open court carry a strong presumption\n\nof verity.\"      Blackledge v. Allison, 431 U.S. 63, 73-74 (1977);\n\nUnited States v. Marrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d 342, 349 (1st Cir. 1997)\n\n(despite later assertions that defendant was pressured by attorney\n\nto   plead   guilty,   the    district   court   reasonably   credited    the\n\ndefendant's sworn statements that he was pleading freely and that\n\nno one had attempted to coerce him).\n\n             In cases where the district court was aware of the\n\npackage nature of the plea, we have held the district court's\n\nvoluntariness inquiry inadequate in only one case.            See Martinez-\n\nMolina, 64 F.3d at 734.         Martinez-Molina held that denial of a\n\nmotion for withdrawal of a guilty plea was error when the district\n\ncourt inquired only into whether the prosecutor had placed pressure\n\non the defendant.      Id.    The Rule 11 colloquy was insufficient to\n\nascertain     voluntariness    because     \"regardless   of   whether    [the\n\ndefendants'] guilty pleas were actually coerced by their co-\n\ndefendants, the literal answer to the court's question could still\n\nhave been 'yes'.\"      Id.\n\n             By contrast, the court's questions here did not limit the\n\ndefendants' answers; the questions were broad enough to include the\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\ftraditional types of coercion and the unique pressure from a co-\n\ndefendant or family member that might be present in a package deal.\n\nThis case is more like United States v. Sanchez-Barreto, 93 F.3d 17\n\n(1st Cir. 1996).4       In Sanchez-Barreto, the defendants contended\n\nthat their pleas were involuntary because of their attorneys'\n\nrecommendations    to   accept   the   plea   bargains      offered   by   the\n\ngovernment on the morning of the first day of trial.                The court\n\nrecognized that \"[s]pecial Rule 11 requirements have been designed\n\nto minimize the significant risk that 'involuntary' guilty pleas\n\nmay be tendered in response to package plea bargain offers from the\n\ngovernment.\"     Id. at 23.      This court found that the Rule 11\n\ncolloquy was adequate to satisfy the \"threshold voluntariness\n\ndeterminations    for   Rule   11(d)   purposes,\"    when    each   defendant\n\nrepeatedly informed the district court that his guilty plea \"had\n\nnot been coerced by anyone . . . .\"                 Id. (emphasis in the\n\noriginal).     The court distinguished this acceptable colloquy from\n\nthe unacceptable colloquy of Martinez-Molina, where the trial court\n\nrestricted its inquiry to prosecutorial coercion.            Id.\n\n          Even if the Rule 11 inquiry could have been more probing,\n\nthere is nothing in the record to suggest that either plea was\n\ninvoluntary due to the package nature of the deal.              There is no\n\n\n\n     4\n       It is not entirely clear from the opinion whether this plea\nbargain was in fact a package deal or the defendants and their\ncounsel believed it was a package deal. In the opinion, the court\ntreated it as such for purposes of the Rule 11 inquiry.\n\n                                   -19-\n\findication from the Rule 11 colloquy that the defendants felt\n\npressure from co-defendants or family members.      See Daniels, 821\n\nF.2d at 79 (holding the Rule 11 colloquy lacking when the judge was\n\nunaware of the package deal and the defendant answered questions\n\nduring the colloquy in such a manner as to indicate that he was\n\nfeeling some family pressure to plead guilty).\n\n           It is true that in their later motions to withdraw,\n\nNelson and Geraldo complained of pressure, but neither complained\n\nof pressure from the fact that the pleas were packaged.      Had the\n\nissue been raised, the district court could have explored it at the\n\nhearing.   Further, both defendants had the opportunity to take the\n\nstand to explain their concerns, which they declined to do.\n\n           Even so, one might argue that a remand to the district\n\ncourt to hold a hearing would be appropriate to eliminate any\n\nconcern.   We decline that option.   Even on appeal, defendants have\n\nnot argued they have suffered harm or that involuntariness occurred\n\nas a result of this being a package deal.      If brotherhood led to\n\ninvoluntary self-sacrifice, Nelson and Geraldo have never said so.\n\nIf pressure from co-defendants coerced them into a deal, Nelson and\n\nGeraldo have never said so.\n\n           Instead they even now offer only prejudice arguments\n\nunrelated to the risks of a package plea.      Geraldo argues he was\n\npressured because he had only 10 minutes to decide whether to\n\naccept the plea.   There are two responses.   First, the \"ten minute\"\n\n\n                                -20-\n\frepresentation is not true.        Plea negotiations took place before\n\ntrial and for hours on the day of trial.           Second, even if it were\n\ntrue that only ten minutes were afforded, the lack of time could be\n\na source of pressure regardless of whether the plea offered was a\n\npackage deal, and \"the strategic decision to plead guilty [is] not\n\n[necessarily]    rendered    involuntary     by   the   anxieties    and   time\n\npressures confronting [the defendant].\"             See United States v.\n\nMarrero-Rivera, 124 F.3d 342, 350 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n          When    asked     what   Geraldo   relied     on    to   demonstrate\n\ninvoluntariness, he replied simply that the plea was a package\n\ndeal, as though such package plea arrangements inherently cannot be\n\nvoluntary.    That is not the law.      Additionally, we will not infer\n\nlack of voluntariness, as the defendant encourages us to do, from\n\nthe mere fact that one co-defendant was his brother or the mere\n\nfact that many of his co-defendants received lighter sentences.\n\n             Nelson articulates a different concern, one which again\n\nis unrelated to the package nature of the plea.              His concern stems\n\nfrom the pressure he was under because his Puerto Rico murder trial\n\ndid not take place before his federal trial and the consequent need\n\nto plead on April 8 to the federal charge.         Even this pressure does\n\nnot render his plea involuntary.       As the government points out, he\n\nwas not charged with the murder in federal court.              It is true the\n\nmurder might be relevant conduct for federal sentencing purposes.\n\nEven were Nelson acquitted of the murder, as he was, the murder\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fstill could have been considered by the sentencing judge.               United\n\nStates v. Watts, 519 U.S. 148, 156 (1997); United States v.\n\nLombard, 102 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 1996); United States v. Lombard,\n\n72 F.3d 170, 175-76 (1st Cir. 1995).                  Moreover, his federal\n\nsentencing exposure was similar whether or not he was found guilty\n\nof the murder in Puerto Rico court.             Even if there had been no\n\nmurder, based solely on the amount of drugs involved in the\n\nconspiracy and attributable to him, Nelson faced a possible life\n\nsentence.\n\n                                     III.\n\nJones Act and Court Reporter Act\n\n            Geraldo argues that the court violated the Jones Act, 48\n\nU.S.C. § 864, and the Court Reporter Act, 28 U.S.C. § 753(b), in\n\nfailing to have the court interpreter translate his statements and\n\nthen failing to have the translation recorded during the sentencing\n\nhearing.    He contends that this failure deprived him of his right\n\nto allocution.        We agree that there was a violation of the two\n\nacts, but hold it was harmless.          He received the lowest sentence\n\navailable and, even were he eloquent in his translated allocution,\n\nhe could not have obtained a lower sentence.\n\n            In the context of allocution statements, we have held\n\nthat the sentencing proceedings were \"irremediably flawed and must\n\nbe   held   afresh\"    when   the   defendant   was    denied   the   right   of\n\nallocution or its functional equivalent under Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n\n                                     -22-\n\f32(i)(4)(A)(ii).    United States v. De Alba Pagan, 33 F.3d 125, 130\n\n(1st Cir. 1994).    To achieve functional equivalency,           \"the court,\n\nthe prosecutor, and the defendant must at the very least interact\n\nin a manner that shows clearly and convincingly that the defendant\n\nknew he had a right to speak on any subject of his choosing prior\n\nto the imposition of sentence.\"        Id. at 129.       Geraldo argues that\n\nbecause the prosecutor did not understand the allocution in Spanish\n\nand the court did not order the translation, it was impossible for\n\nthe prosecutor to interact in the way envisioned in De Alba Pagan.\n\n\n\n            This part of the case involves two statutes: The Jones\n\nAct, 48 U.S.C. § 864, and the Court Reporter Act, 28 U.S.C. §\n\n753(b).     The Jones Act provides that \"[a]ll proceedings in the\n\nUnited States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico shall\n\nbe conducted in the English language,\" and the Court Reporter Act\n\nmandates that certain proceedings \"be recorded verbatim [including]\n\nall   proceedings    in   criminal     cases    [held]    in   open    court.\"\n\n            At   Geraldo's   sentencing,       neither    of   these    things\n\nhappened.    After the prosecutor offered his recommended sentence,\n\nthe court asked Geraldo whether he had anything he wished to say.\n\nGeraldo read a written statement in Spanish.             This statement was\n\nnot translated by the court interpreter, and it was not transcribed\n\ninto the record.    However, the court was fluent in Spanish, and the\n\nhandwritten statement itself was included in the record.\n\n\n                                     -23-\n\f            Violations   of    these       acts   do   not    require    automatic\n\nreversal.      \"[N]othing      prescribes         automatic        reversal   of    a\n\ndefendant's convictions for non-compliance with [the Court Reporter\n\nAct].    Rather, to obtain reversal and a new trial, the defendant\n\nmust demonstrate specific prejudice to his ability to perfect an\n\nappeal, beyond mere non-compliance with the Court Reporter Act.\"\n\nUnited States v. Smith, 292 F.3d 90, 97 (1st Cir. 2002)(applying\n\nharmless error review to a Court Reporter Act violation)(citations\n\nand quotations omitted).           As to the Jones Act, we have reviewed\n\nthese violations for plain error when they were not raised until\n\nappeal. United States v. Morales-Madera, 352 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.\n\n2003).\n\n            Even   assuming    an    impairment        of    Geraldo's   right     to\n\nallocution, any such impairment was harmless.

Carper, 24 F.3d 1157,\n\n1162 (9th Cir. 1994)).\n\n            Nonetheless,      we    once   again    note     the    importance     of\n\ncompliance with the Jones Act.

Sometimes these are referred to as \"wired\" pleas, that is, two or more pleas are linked.

He asserted other grounds than that the plea was part of a package deal, but did say he had felt pressured. Nelson, Geraldo's brother, also filed a motion to withdraw. That motion also did not rely on the package nature of the deal. Both motions alleged a different sort of pressure stemming from related murder charges pending against Nelson and Geraldo in Puerto Rico court. The Commonwealth charge had not been resolved when the defendants pled guilty on April 8, 2002, to the federal charges. The defendants had unsuccessfully argued for postponement of the federal trial until the Commonwealth murder charges were resolved (eventually they were acquitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court denied both motions to withdraw after a hearing in which each defendant declined the opportunity to testify. Neither defendant argued that the package nature of the plea deal put them under such pressure that their pleas were not voluntary. That argument is made for the first time on this appeal from the denials of the motions to withdraw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both argue that it was plain error for the district court to fail to perform a more searching inquiry into whether the package plea had been entered into voluntarily. They ask this court to remand the case to allow them to withdraw their guilty pleas and proceed to trial or, in the alternative, to require the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing on the voluntariness of their guilty pleas. Finally, Geraldo argues that the district court's failure to have the interpreter translate his allocution statements into English violated the Jones Act, 48 U.S.C. &#167; 864, and the Court Reporter Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 753(b), and effectively deprived him of his right to allocution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the district court did not commit plain error in denying the motions to withdraw, and the Jones and Court Reporter Acts errors were harmless. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Geraldo and Nelson are brothers. At the time of the plea, they were 32 and 30 respectively. On August 30, 2001, the grand jury returned an indictment against Geraldo and Nelson and seven other co-defendants. Count One charged them with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute in excess of one kilogram of heroin, five kilograms of cocaine, five kilograms of cocaine base, and in excess of fifty pounds of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 846. Count Two of the indictment sought forfeiture under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 12, 2001, Geraldo and Nelson were arrested, pursuant to an arrest warrant issued on August 30, 2001. On September 25, 2001, Geraldo and Nelson pled not guilty to both counts of the indictment. The court set a trial date of April 8, 2002, and the jury trial was set to begin for Geraldo and Nelson, and four other co-defendants, Nelson Delgado-Vazquez, Juan A. Torres, Yazugui Alvarado-Maldonado, and Angel Muniz-De Jesus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The morning the trial started, counsel for all of the defendants approached the prosecutor and asked if the government would extend a plea offer. The prosecutor had made an earlier plea offer, but it had expired on April 1, 2002. The government said it would not simply extend the old offer; it made a new offer which increased the length of the sentences and made any plea contingent on it being a package deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently the court was told there were negotiations and did not resume the trial immediately after the lunch break. Later that afternoon at 5:00 pm, the court noted that it had interrupted the trial to permit negotiations. One of the defense counsel asked to delay further because he was still explaining the pleas to his client. At that point, two defendants, Muniz and Alvarado, had tendered pleas. The court indicated that it would take those two pleas and resume trial in the morning as to the other four defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When defense counsel asked for more time, the court asked why counsel had not considered all this before trial. Counsel for Torres said they had considered it before that day and that he had brought the offer to his client several weeks before. Counsel for Delgado then said, \"I think there is a reasonable guarantee that if we wait for another ten minutes everyone will plea[d].\" The government then put on the record that its earlier plea offer had expired on April 1 and the new offer to each defendant was contingent on it being a package deal. This was the first time that the court was informed of the package nature of the plea. Counsel for Geraldo and Nelson said nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court granted the extra time, telling the defendants that they should know nobody was forcing them and no one could force them to plead guilty. After that break (the record does not indicate its duration) the court was presented with guilty pleas from all defendants. Each of the defendants was present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court proceeded to take the defendants' guilty pleas, informing the defendants that it would have to ask several questions to determine whether the \"plea of guilty is done with knowledge of consequences, aware of the fact that you are waiving a number of rights.\" The court then addressed each defendant individually in turn, asking questions concerning the defendant's competency to plead guilty, his satisfaction with his representation, and whether he had ample opportunity to discuss with his attorney the implications of his guilty plea. The court received affirmative answers from both Nelson and Geraldo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After being satisfied that each defendant was competent to plead guilty, the court addressed the defendants as a group. It asked questions concerning whether they understood the rights afforded to them under the Constitution, the rights which they were giving up by pleading guilty. Having discussed those matters, the court asked whether each still wanted to plead guilty and received an affirmative response. The court asked each whether he had seen the indictment, and received affirmative answers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court once again addressed the defendants individually to explain the charges against each, what the government would have to prove, and the possible sentence that each might receive. The defendants affirmed that they understood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court addressed the group as a whole and asked, \"Has <i>anyone</i> threatened you or forced you in any form or fashion or induced you to plead guilty in this case?\" (Emphasis added). Each answered no.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again, the court addressed each defendant individually to discuss the specifics of each plea agreement and the facts to which each defendant was stipulating. The court confirmed individually that each had done what he was accused of doing. The court then turned to the defendants as a group and asked, \"Has <i>anybody</i> made any promises to any one of you to induce you to plea?\" (Emphasis added). All defendants answered no. The final question asked by the court was \"[is there] any reason why these pleas should not be accepted?\" All attorneys answered no. After ascertaining from the prosecutor that she had the necessary evidence to proceed to trial, the court accepted the pleas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 2002, over two months after the guilty plea was accepted, Geraldo filed a pro se request for withdrawal of his guilty plea. On July 19, 2002, this motion was followed by a verified motion to withdraw the guilty plea. Nelson filed a verified motion to withdraw his guilty plea on July 16, 2002. The government responded in opposition to both on July 31, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The thrust of Geraldo's motion to withdraw his plea was that he felt pressured by the prosecution's intent to obtain a life sentence because Geraldo was tied to three murders in the course of the conspiracy. The motion implied that the subject of the murders had come up at the last minute. On March 6, 2002, the government gave notice that in its case in chief it would try to prove the involvement of Geraldo (and others) in three murders. However, on March 19, the government gave notice it would not try to tie him to two of the murders, but would introduce evidence tying Geraldo to the murder of Carlos Maldonado Berrios. Geraldo was charged in Puerto Rico court with that murder. In the plea negotiations before trial, the government said it would not negotiate a term of imprisonment below 19 years. The plea offer at the time of trial was that the government would recommend 20 years. The motion referred to \"the pressure he was subject to as the exposure was to a life sentence.\" The motion never mentioned pressure from the package plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's opposition to the motion responded to Geraldo's argument and said both allegations were untrue. It pointed out that Geraldo had, on the drug conspiracy charges alone, always faced a potential life sentence, regardless of the murder. The prosecution also pointed out that there was no surprise &#8212; it said that it made clear within three weeks of indictment it would seek to introduce evidence of the murders. The prosecution pointed out that the timing of the motion to withdraw was immediately after Geraldo was acquitted of the murder at trial in the local court and that the defendant merely wanted a second bite at the apple in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nelson's motion to withdraw and the government's response to it were similar to Geraldo's. Nelson too argued that the \"pressure ... was extraordinary as a drug conspiracy case had turned into a drug related murder case with a very real exposure of a life sentence.\" Nelson also made no allegations of pressures associated with the package nature of the plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held a hearing on the motions for both defendants on August 14, 2002. When asked to give the core argument for withdrawal, Nelson's counsel informed the court,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[H]e feels that 20 years for his plea is too much time. He has told me that he did go for it because he felt at that time that he could not do anything else because he was here and he felt that he had no other choice except to plead guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the murder, the counsel stated, \"that was one of the issues throughout this case trying to make a plea because we had evidence in his case that there could be, you know, evidence as to murders.\" As the court correctly pointed out, Nelson's plea did not include any admissions as to murder. The plea only held him responsible for the drug charges. In response to whether Nelson was trying to argue that he was innocent of the drug charges, the counsel replied, \"no, your Honor.\" The court then summed up Nelson's argument: \"He is simply saying that [he] took too much time, if you will, by way of a recommendation because of the pressures of an impending trial.\" The court continued, \"[s]o basically this is it. It was too much time [to serve] and it was a lot of pressure and that is too much drugs basically.\" Nelson presented no evidence, and he chose not to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Geraldo's counsel made similar arguments. He characterized Geraldo's objection as, \"[b]asically it is too much time for the amount of drugs that he dealt with. That is basically his point.\" Geraldo's plea agreement did not contain any admissions as to murder, and he also said he did not wish to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found that there was no fair and just reason to allow withdrawal of the guilty pleas. In the plea agreements there were no adjustments for murder or for weapons possession and the defendants pled guilty only to the drug charges. The court stated, \"[u]nder these circumstances, I do think that there is nothing on this record to suggest ... that these pleas were involuntarily entered and there is no reason for me to consider anything other than going ahead with sentencing in due time.\" In a written order, the court repeated this assertion and stated, \"[w]hen their pleas were taken, they did it voluntarily and aware of what they were doing. No suspicion was alerted to the court. Even more, the court asked them if there was any other reason for them not to plead, and they answered in the negative.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 21, 2002, both Geraldo and Nelson were sentenced to 235 months in prison and no fine. They were also sentenced to serve a five year term of supervised release, and the court imposed a special monetary assessment of $100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Involuntariness of the Plea</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court has accepted the plea and prior to the defendant's sentencing, the district court should liberally allow withdrawal of guilty pleas for any \"fair and just reason.\" Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). Once the district court has ruled on the defendant's motion to withdraw the guilty plea, however, the standard of appellate review is for abuse of discretion on preserved issues. <i>United States v. Daniels,</i> 821 F.2d 76, 78 (1st Cir.1987). Still, that discretion may be limited where a core concern such as voluntariness is raised and preserved. <i>United</i> <i>States v. Abbott,</i> 241 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir.2001). Here, the defendants do not get the benefit of an abuse of discretion standard of review, because they did not raise the issue of the package nature of the deal before the district court. Accordingly, the review is for plain error. <i>United States v. Vonn,</i> 535 U.S. 55, 59, 122 S.Ct. 1043, 152 L.Ed.2d 90 (2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An unobjected-to error in the Rule 11 colloquy is reversible error only upon a showing of plain error. <i>Id.</i> at 63, 122 S.Ct. 1043. Since the Supreme Court's decision in 2002 in <i>Vonn,</i> the defendant's failure to raise the objection in the trial court has two consequences. First, it is defendant's burden to satisfy the plain error rule. It is not the government's burden to show any error was harmless. Second, the reviewing court may consider the entire record when assessing the effect of any error on substantial rights. <i>Id.</i> at 74.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To satisfy its burden, the defendant must show four things: 1) an error occurred, 2) the error was clear or obvious, 3) it affected the defendant's substantial rights, and 4) it seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732-35, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993); <i>United States v. Gandia-Maysonet,</i> 227 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.2000). There is no contention that the court's Rule 11 inquiry was insufficient save for these being package pleas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In package plea arrangements, the prosecutor offers a benefit or detriment to all (the defendant and third parties) in order to persuade the entire group of defendants to plead guilty. These types of arrangements are not per se involuntary. Still, package plea deals raise at least two types of risks. The first is that a defendant is coerced by co-defendants to plead guilty involuntarily. One defendant may be coerced into pleading guilty by a co-defendant who believes he is getting a good deal under the package deal. <i>United States v. Martinez-Molina,</i> 64 F.3d 719, 732-33 (1st Cir.1995). The second is that there may be a family relationship between two defendants which leads one defendant to involuntarily sacrifice his own best interests for those of a family member (or perhaps both family members to involuntarily sacrifice themselves) in a belief that the package deal will benefit the other.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Abbott,</i> 241 F.3d at 33; <i>Daniels,</i> 821 F.2d at 79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to this second risk, there is a distinction to be drawn. The concern of the law is for voluntariness. \"If a defendant elects to sacrifice himself [to protect someone close to him] that is his choice, and he cannot reverse it after he is dissatisfied with his sentence, or with other subsequent developments.\" <i>United States v. Buckley,</i> 847 F.2d 991, 1000 n. 6 (1st Cir.1988)(quoting <i>Kent v. United States,</i> 272 F.2d 795, 798 (1st Cir.1959)).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On the other side of the coin from these risks, package plea situations present the possibility of manipulation of the system: one defendant obtains a benefit for a co-defendant and then moves to withdraw his own plea, the benefit having been given. <i>Daniels,</i> 821 F.2d at 79. Benefits accrue to the individual defendants involved, from both the traditional prosecutorial bargaining chips and the elimination of the dilemma where one co-defendant is pressured to plead by the fear that another co-defendant will plead and then testify against him. In the package plea situation, defendants can be confident that all co-defendants are pleading guilty. Here, each defendant received a benefit of avoiding the risk of a life sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has crafted a two-part rule in package guilty plea situations to ensure voluntariness. First, the prosecution should inform the trial court before the Rule 11 colloquy that the plea is a package deal so that the court is aware of the situation. Second, the court's ensuing colloquy should show sensitivity to the issue of voluntariness in light of those pressures. <i>Martinez-Molina,</i> 64 F.3d at 733. We have not, though, mandated that extra procedures be followed, only that the court should assess voluntariness with an eye to the special situation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Cf. United States v. Holland,</i> 117 F.3d 589, 594 (D.C.Cir.1997)(recognizing that \"wired\" pleas can be coercive, but refusing to mandate a special voluntariness inquiry by the district court when faced with a wired plea)(citing <i>United States v. Farley,</i> 72 F.3d 158, 163 (D.C.Cir.1995)).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The greatest risk comes when the government has not informed the court that the plea is part of a package deal. Where we have reversed and vacated such pleas, it has been most often when the prosecution failed to make the disclosure to the trial court. <i>Abbott,</i> 241 F.3d at 33-35; <i>Daniels,</i> 821 F.2d at 79-81. Here there is no doubt that the trial court knew the deal was a package deal. It was told so by the prosecution in the presence of defendants and their counsel. We reject the defendants' argument that they are entitled to reversal because the government did not formally announce at the Rule 11 colloquy itself <i>again</i> that this was a package deal situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of the adequacy of the court's inquiry on voluntariness is a bit closer. We review that question in light of the risks inherent in package deals and the plain error standard of review. We need not answer the question of whether the rather spartan colloquy would have been adequate if the package plea issue had been preserved by defendants. The court did not ask a direct question about voluntariness and did not explore whether the nature of the package deal impaired the voluntariness of any of the pleas. A more direct inquiry might have avoided this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court did ask the defendants \"[h]as anyone threatened you or forced you in any form or fashion or induced you to plead guilty in this case\" and \"[h]as anybody made any promises to any one of you to induce you to plea?\" To both of these questions the defendants answered no. Additionally, at the end of the colloquy, the court asked whether there was \"any reason why these pleas should not be accepted?\" All counsel for the defendants answered no.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there were pressures from co-defendants or from the fraternal relationship that led to involuntariness, Nelson and Geraldo had adequate opportunity to say so. To the contrary, the defendants' answers to the court's questions indicate that they pled guilty of their own volition, fully aware of the rights they were relinquishing and the charges they were accepting. The defendants' \"declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity.\" <i>Blackledge v. Allison,</i> 431 U.S. 63, 73-74, 97 S.Ct. 1621, 52 L.Ed.2d 136 (1977); <i>United States v. Marrero-Rivera,</i> 124 F.3d 342, 349 (1st Cir.1997) (despite later assertions that defendant was pressured by attorney to plead guilty, the district court reasonably credited the defendant's sworn statements that he was pleading freely and that no one had attempted to coerce him).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In cases where the district court was aware of the package nature of the plea, we have held the district court's voluntariness inquiry inadequate in only one case. <i>See Martinez-Molina,</i> 64 F.3d at 734. <i>Martinez-Molina</i> held that denial of a motion for withdrawal of a guilty plea was error when the district court inquired only into whether the <i>prosecutor</i> had placed pressure on the defendant. <i>Id.</i> The Rule 11 colloquy was insufficient to ascertain voluntariness because \"regardless of whether [the defendants'] guilty pleas were actually coerced by their co-defendants, the literal answer to the court's question could still have been `yes'.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, the court's questions here did not limit the defendants' answers; the questions were broad enough to include the traditional types of coercion and the unique pressure from a co-defendant or family member that might be present in a package deal. This case is more like <i>United States v. Sanchez-Barreto,</i> 93 F.3d 17 (1st Cir.1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In <i>Sanchez-Barreto,</i> the defendants contended that their pleas were involuntary because of their attorneys' recommendations to accept the plea bargains offered by the government on the morning of the first day of trial. The court recognized that \"[s]pecial Rule 11 requirements have been designed to minimize the significant risk that `involuntary' guilty pleas may be tendered in response to package plea bargain offers from the government.\" <i>Id.</i> at 23. This court found that the Rule 11 colloquy was adequate to satisfy the \"threshold voluntariness determinations for Rule 11(d) purposes,\" when each defendant repeatedly informed the district court that his guilty plea \"had not been coerced by <i>anyone</i> ....\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in the original). The court distinguished this acceptable colloquy from the unacceptable colloquy of <i>Martinez-Molina,</i> where the trial court restricted its inquiry to prosecutorial coercion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the Rule 11 inquiry could have been more probing, there is nothing in the record to suggest that either plea was involuntary due to the package nature of the deal. There is no indication from the Rule 11 colloquy that the defendants felt pressure from co-defendants or family members. <i>See Daniels,</i> 821 F.2d at 79 (holding the Rule 11 colloquy lacking when the judge was unaware of the package deal and the defendant answered questions during the colloquy in such a manner as to indicate that he was feeling some family pressure to plead guilty).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that in their later motions to withdraw, Nelson and Geraldo complained of pressure, but neither complained of pressure from the fact that the pleas were packaged. Had the issue been raised, the district court could have explored it at the hearing. Further, both defendants had the opportunity to take the stand to explain their concerns, which they declined to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, one might argue that a remand to the district court to hold a hearing would be appropriate to eliminate any concern. We decline that option. Even on appeal, defendants have not argued they have suffered harm or that involuntariness occurred as a result of this being a package deal. If brotherhood led to involuntary self-sacrifice, Nelson and Geraldo have never said so. If pressure from co-defendants coerced them into a deal, Nelson and Geraldo have never said so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead they even now offer only prejudice arguments unrelated to the risks of a package plea. Geraldo argues he was pressured because he had only 10 minutes to decide whether to accept the plea. There are two responses. First, the \"ten minute\" representation is not true. Plea negotiations took place before trial and for hours on the day of trial. Second, even if it were true that only ten minutes were afforded, the lack of time could be a source of pressure regardless of whether the plea offered was a package deal, and \"the strategic decision to plead guilty [is] not [necessarily] rendered involuntary by the anxieties and time pressures confronting [the defendant].\" <i>See United States v. Marrero-Rivera,</i> 124 F.3d 342, 350 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked what Geraldo relied on to demonstrate involuntariness, he replied simply that the plea was a package deal, as though such package plea arrangements inherently cannot be voluntary. That is not the law. Additionally, we will not infer lack of voluntariness, as the defendant encourages us to do, from the mere fact that one co-defendant was his brother or the mere fact that many of his co-defendants received lighter sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nelson articulates a different concern, one which again is unrelated to the package nature of the plea. His concern stems from the pressure he was under because his Puerto Rico murder trial did not take place before his federal trial and the consequent need to plead on April 8 to the federal charge. Even this pressure does not render his plea involuntary. As the government points out, he was not charged with the murder in federal court. It is true the murder might be relevant conduct for federal sentencing purposes. Even were Nelson acquitted of the murder, as he was, the murder still could have been considered by the sentencing judge. <i>United States v. Watts,</i> 519 U.S. 148, 156, 117 S.Ct. 633, 136 L.Ed.2d 554 (1997); <i>United States v. Lombard,</i> 102 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Lombard,</i> 72 F.3d 170, 175-76 (1st Cir.1995). Moreover, his federal sentencing exposure was similar whether or not he was found guilty of the murder in Puerto Rico court. Even if there had been no murder, based solely on the amount of drugs involved in the conspiracy and attributable to him, Nelson faced a possible life sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Jones Act and Court Reporter Act</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Geraldo argues that the court violated the Jones Act, 48 U.S.C. &#167; 864, and the Court Reporter Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 753(b), in failing to have the court interpreter translate his statements and then failing to have the translation recorded during the sentencing hearing. He contends that this failure deprived him of his right to allocution. We agree that there was a violation of the two acts, but hold it was harmless. He received the lowest sentence available and, even were he eloquent in his translated allocution, he could not have obtained a lower sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the context of allocution statements, we have held that the sentencing proceedings were \"irremediably flawed and must be held afresh\" when the defendant was denied the right of allocution or its functional equivalent under Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(i)(4)(A)(ii). <i>United States v. De Alba Pagan,</i> 33 F.3d 125, 130 (1st Cir.1994). To achieve functional equivalency, \"the court, the prosecutor, and the defendant must at the very least interact in a manner that shows clearly and convincingly that the defendant knew he had a right to speak on any subject of his choosing prior to the imposition of sentence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 129. Geraldo argues that because the prosecutor did not understand the allocution in Spanish and the court did not order the translation, it was impossible for the prosecutor to interact in the way envisioned in <i>De Alba Pagan.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This part of the case involves two statutes: The Jones Act, 48 U.S.C. &#167; 864, and the Court Reporter Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 753(b). The Jones Act provides that \"[a]ll proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico shall be conducted in the English language,\" and the Court Reporter Act mandates that certain proceedings \"be recorded verbatim [including] all proceedings in criminal cases [held] in open court.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Geraldo's sentencing, neither of these things happened. After the prosecutor offered his recommended sentence, the court asked Geraldo whether he had anything he wished to say. Geraldo read a written statement in Spanish. This statement was not translated by the court interpreter, and it was not transcribed into the record. However, the court was fluent in Spanish, and the handwritten statement itself was included in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Violations of these acts do not require automatic reversal. \"[N]othing prescribes automatic reversal of a defendant's convictions for non-compliance with [the Court Reporter Act]. Rather, to obtain reversal and a new trial, the defendant must demonstrate specific prejudice to his ability to perfect an appeal, beyond mere non-compliance with the Court Reporter Act.\" <i>United States v. Smith,</i> 292 F.3d 90, 97 (1st Cir.2002)(applying harmless error review to a Court Reporter Act violation) (citations and quotations omitted). As to the Jones Act, we have reviewed these violations for plain error when they were not raised until appeal. <i>United States v. Morales-Madera,</i> 352 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even assuming an impairment of Geraldo's right to allocution, any such impairment was harmless. <i>De Alba Pagan,</i> 33 F.3d at 130 n. 5. (suggesting application of the harmless error rule when \"a sentence is `already as short as it could possibly be under the Guidelines'\")(quoting <i>United States v.

The pleas were part of a package deal, that is, the government's offer was contingent on all defendants entering plea agreements. Sometimes these are referred to as \"wired\" pleas, that is, two or more pleas are linked. The package deal was reached late in the afternoon on the first day of trial, after jury impanelment in the morning, but before witnesses were presented.

The district court, informed by the government that this was a package deal situation, had continued the trial at the request of defense counsel to give time for negotiations. The court was informed that the negotiations were successful and took the pleas. The court, at the Rule 11 colloquy, asked some questions individually of each defendant and some of the group. Satisfied that the pleas were voluntary, the court accepted the pleas from all defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over two months later, Geraldo filed two motions to withdraw his pleas. He asserted other grounds than that the plea was part of a package deal, but did say he had felt pressured. Nelson, Geraldo's brother, also filed a motion to withdraw. That motion also did not rely on the package nature of the deal. Both motions alleged a different sort of pressure stemming from related murder charges pending against Nelson and Geraldo in Puerto Rico court. The Commonwealth charge had not been resolved when the defendants pled guilty on April 8, 2002, to the federal charges. The defendants had unsuccessfully argued for postponement of the federal trial until the Commonwealth murder charges were resolved (eventually they were acquitted).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court denied both motions to withdraw after a hearing in which each defendant declined the opportunity to testify. Neither defendant argued that the package nature of the plea deal put them under such pressure that their pleas were not voluntary. That argument is made for the first time on this appeal from the denials of the motions to withdraw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Both argue that it was plain error for the district court to fail to perform a more searching inquiry into whether the package plea had been entered into voluntarily. They ask this court to remand the case to allow them to withdraw their guilty pleas and proceed to trial or, in the alternative, to require the district court to hold an evidentiary hearing on the voluntariness of their guilty pleas. Finally, Geraldo argues that the district court's failure to have the interpreter translate his allocution statements into English violated the Jones Act, 48 U.S.C. &#167; 864, and the Court Reporter Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 753(b), and effectively deprived him of his right to allocution.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We find that the district court did not commit plain error in denying the motions to withdraw, and the Jones and Court Reporter Acts errors were harmless.

At the time of the plea, they were 32 and 30 respectively. On August 30, 2001, the grand jury returned an indictment against Geraldo and Nelson and seven other co-defendants. Count One charged them with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute in excess of one kilogram of heroin, five kilograms of cocaine, five kilograms of cocaine base, and in excess of fifty pounds of marijuana, in violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1) and 846. Count Two of the indictment sought forfeiture under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 982.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 12, 2001, Geraldo and Nelson were arrested, pursuant to an arrest warrant issued on August 30, 2001. On September 25, 2001, Geraldo and Nelson pled not guilty to both counts of the indictment. The court set a trial date of April 8, 2002, and the jury trial was set to begin for Geraldo and Nelson, and four other co-defendants, Nelson Delgado-Vazquez, Juan A. Torres, Yazugui Alvarado-Maldonado, and Angel Muniz-De Jesus.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The morning the trial started, counsel for all of the defendants approached the prosecutor and asked if the government would extend a plea offer. The prosecutor had made an earlier plea offer, but it had expired on April 1, 2002. The government said it would not simply extend the old offer; it made a new offer which increased the length of the sentences and made any plea contingent on it being a package deal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Apparently the court was told there were negotiations and did not resume the trial immediately after the lunch break. Later that afternoon at 5:00 pm, the court noted that it had interrupted the trial to permit negotiations. One of the defense counsel asked to delay further because he was still explaining the pleas to his client. At that point, two defendants, Muniz and Alvarado, had tendered pleas. The court indicated that it would take those two pleas and resume trial in the morning as to the other four defendants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When defense counsel asked for more time, the court asked why counsel had not considered all this before trial. Counsel for Torres said they had considered it before that day and that he had brought the offer to his client several weeks before. Counsel for Delgado then said, \"I think there is a reasonable guarantee that if we wait for another ten minutes everyone will plea[d].\" The government then put on the record that its earlier plea offer had expired on April 1 and the new offer to each defendant was contingent on it being a package deal. This was the first time that the court was informed of the package nature of the plea. Counsel for Geraldo and Nelson said nothing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court granted the extra time, telling the defendants that they should know nobody was forcing them and no one could force them to plead guilty. After that break (the record does not indicate its duration) the court was presented with guilty pleas from all defendants. Each of the defendants was present.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court proceeded to take the defendants' guilty pleas, informing the defendants that it would have to ask several questions to determine whether the \"plea of guilty is done with knowledge of consequences, aware of the fact that you are waiving a number of rights.\" The court then addressed each defendant individually in turn, asking questions concerning the defendant's competency to plead guilty, his satisfaction with his representation, and whether he had ample opportunity to discuss with his attorney the implications of his guilty plea. The court received affirmative answers from both Nelson and Geraldo.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After being satisfied that each defendant was competent to plead guilty, the court addressed the defendants as a group. It asked questions concerning whether they understood the rights afforded to them under the Constitution, the rights which they were giving up by pleading guilty. Having discussed those matters, the court asked whether each still wanted to plead guilty and received an affirmative response. The court asked each whether he had seen the indictment, and received affirmative answers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court once again addressed the defendants individually to explain the charges against each, what the government would have to prove, and the possible sentence that each might receive. The defendants affirmed that they understood.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court addressed the group as a whole and asked, \"Has <i>anyone</i> threatened you or forced you in any form or fashion or induced you to plead guilty in this case?\" (Emphasis added). Each answered no.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Once again, the court addressed each defendant individually to discuss the specifics of each plea agreement and the facts to which each defendant was stipulating. The court confirmed individually that each had done what he was accused of doing. The court then turned to the defendants as a group and asked, \"Has <i>anybody</i> made any promises to any one of you to induce you to plea?\" (Emphasis added). All defendants answered no. The final question asked by the court was \"[is there] any reason why these pleas should not be accepted?\" All attorneys answered no. After ascertaining from the prosecutor that she had the necessary evidence to proceed to trial, the court accepted the pleas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On June 28, 2002, over two months after the guilty plea was accepted, Geraldo filed a pro se request for withdrawal of his guilty plea. On July 19, 2002, this motion was followed by a verified motion to withdraw the guilty plea. Nelson filed a verified motion to withdraw his guilty plea on July 16, 2002. The government responded in opposition to both on July 31, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The thrust of Geraldo's motion to withdraw his plea was that he felt pressured by the prosecution's intent to obtain a life sentence because Geraldo was tied to three murders in the course of the conspiracy. The motion implied that the subject of the murders had come up at the last minute. On March 6, 2002, the government gave notice that in its case in chief it would try to prove the involvement of Geraldo (and others) in three murders. However, on March 19, the government gave notice it would not try to tie him to two of the murders, but would introduce evidence tying Geraldo to the murder of Carlos Maldonado Berrios. Geraldo was charged in Puerto Rico court with that murder. In the plea negotiations before trial, the government said it would not negotiate a term of imprisonment below 19 years. The plea offer at the time of trial was that the government would recommend 20 years. The motion referred to \"the pressure he was subject to as the exposure was to a life sentence.\" The motion never mentioned pressure from the package plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government's opposition to the motion responded to Geraldo's argument and said both allegations were untrue. It pointed out that Geraldo had, on the drug conspiracy charges alone, always faced a potential life sentence, regardless of the murder. The prosecution also pointed out that there was no surprise &#8212; it said that it made clear within three weeks of indictment it would seek to introduce evidence of the murders. The prosecution pointed out that the timing of the motion to withdraw was immediately after Geraldo was acquitted of the murder at trial in the local court and that the defendant merely wanted a second bite at the apple in federal court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nelson's motion to withdraw and the government's response to it were similar to Geraldo's. Nelson too argued that the \"pressure ... was extraordinary as a drug conspiracy case had turned into a drug related murder case with a very real exposure of a life sentence.\" Nelson also made no allegations of pressures associated with the package nature of the plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court held a hearing on the motions for both defendants on August 14, 2002. When asked to give the core argument for withdrawal, Nelson's counsel informed the court,</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">[H]e feels that 20 years for his plea is too much time. He has told me that he did go for it because he felt at that time that he could not do anything else because he was here and he felt that he had no other choice except to plead guilty.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the murder, the counsel stated, \"that was one of the issues throughout this case trying to make a plea because we had evidence in his case that there could be, you know, evidence as to murders.\" As the court correctly pointed out, Nelson's plea did not include any admissions as to murder. The plea only held him responsible for the drug charges. In response to whether Nelson was trying to argue that he was innocent of the drug charges, the counsel replied, \"no, your Honor.\" The court then summed up Nelson's argument: \"He is simply saying that [he] took too much time, if you will, by way of a recommendation because of the pressures of an impending trial.\" The court continued, \"[s]o basically this is it. It was too much time [to serve] and it was a lot of pressure and that is too much drugs basically.\" Nelson presented no evidence, and he chose not to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Geraldo's counsel made similar arguments. He characterized Geraldo's objection as, \"[b]asically it is too much time for the amount of drugs that he dealt with. That is basically his point.\" Geraldo's plea agreement did not contain any admissions as to murder, and he also said he did not wish to testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court found that there was no fair and just reason to allow withdrawal of the guilty pleas. In the plea agreements there were no adjustments for murder or for weapons possession and the defendants pled guilty only to the drug charges. The court stated, \"[u]nder these circumstances, I do think that there is nothing on this record to suggest ... that these pleas were involuntarily entered and there is no reason for me to consider anything other than going ahead with sentencing in due time.\" In a written order, the court repeated this assertion and stated, \"[w]hen their pleas were taken, they did it voluntarily and aware of what they were doing. No suspicion was alerted to the court. Even more, the court asked them if there was any other reason for them not to plead, and they answered in the negative.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On November 21, 2002, both Geraldo and Nelson were sentenced to 235 months in prison and no fine. They were also sentenced to serve a five year term of supervised release, and the court imposed a special monetary assessment of $100.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Involuntariness of the Plea</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the district court has accepted the plea and prior to the defendant's sentencing, the district court should liberally allow withdrawal of guilty pleas for any \"fair and just reason.\" Fed. R.Crim.P. 11(d)(2)(B). Once the district court has ruled on the defendant's motion to withdraw the guilty plea, however, the standard of appellate review is for abuse of discretion on preserved issues. <i>United States v.

Still, that discretion may be limited where a core concern such as voluntariness is raised and preserved. <i>United</i> <i>States v.

Here, the defendants do not get the benefit of an abuse of discretion standard of review, because they did not raise the issue of the package nature of the deal before the district court. Accordingly, the review is for plain error. <i>United States v.

Since the Supreme Court's decision in 2002 in <i>Vonn,</i> the defendant's failure to raise the objection in the trial court has two consequences. First, it is defendant's burden to satisfy the plain error rule. It is not the government's burden to show any error was harmless.

There is no contention that the court's Rule 11 inquiry was insufficient save for these being package pleas.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In package plea arrangements, the prosecutor offers a benefit or detriment to all (the defendant and third parties) in order to persuade the entire group of defendants to plead guilty. These types of arrangements are not per se involuntary. Still, package plea deals raise at least two types of risks. The first is that a defendant is coerced by co-defendants to plead guilty involuntarily. One defendant may be coerced into pleading guilty by a co-defendant who believes he is getting a good deal under the package deal. <i>United States v. Martinez-Molina,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196268\"><a href=\"/opinion/196268/united-states-v-martinez-molina/\"><span class=\"volume\">64</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">719</span></a></span>, 732-33 (1st Cir.1995). The second is that there may be a family relationship between two defendants which leads one defendant to involuntarily sacrifice his own best interests for those of a family member (or perhaps both family members to involuntarily sacrifice themselves) in a belief that the package deal will benefit the other.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>Abbott,</i> 241 F.3d at 33; <i>Daniels,</i> 821 F.2d at 79.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to this second risk, there is a distinction to be drawn. The concern of the law is for voluntariness. \"If a defendant elects to sacrifice himself [to protect someone close to him] that is his choice, and he cannot reverse it after he is dissatisfied with his sentence, or with other subsequent developments.\" <i>United States v. Buckley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"506591\"><a href=\"/opinion/506591/united-states-v-david-k-buckley-david-k-buckley-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">847</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">991</span></a></span>, 1000 n. 6 (1st Cir.1988)(quoting <i>Kent v.

Benefits accrue to the individual defendants involved, from both the traditional prosecutorial bargaining chips and the elimination of the dilemma where one co-defendant is pressured to plead by the fear that another co-defendant will plead and then testify against him. In the package plea situation, defendants can be confident that all co-defendants are pleading guilty. Here, each defendant received a benefit of avoiding the risk of a life sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This circuit has crafted a two-part rule in package guilty plea situations to ensure voluntariness. First, the prosecution should inform the trial court before the Rule 11 colloquy that the plea is a package deal so that the court is aware of the situation. Second, the court's ensuing colloquy should show sensitivity to the issue of voluntariness in light of those pressures. <i>Martinez-Molina,</i> 64 F.3d at 733. We have not, though, mandated that extra procedures be followed, only that the court should assess voluntariness with an eye to the special situation.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Cf.

Where we have reversed and vacated such pleas, it has been most often when the prosecution failed to make the disclosure to the trial court. <i>Abbott,</i> 241 F.3d at 33-35; <i>Daniels,</i> 821 F.2d at 79-81. Here there is no doubt that the trial court knew the deal was a package deal. It was told so by the prosecution in the presence of defendants and their counsel. We reject the defendants' argument that they are entitled to reversal because the government did not formally announce at the Rule 11 colloquy itself <i>again</i> that this was a package deal situation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The question of the adequacy of the court's inquiry on voluntariness is a bit closer. We review that question in light of the risks inherent in package deals and the plain error standard of review. We need not answer the question of whether the rather spartan colloquy would have been adequate if the package plea issue had been preserved by defendants. The court did not ask a direct question about voluntariness and did not explore whether the nature of the package deal impaired the voluntariness of any of the pleas. A more direct inquiry might have avoided this appeal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The court did ask the defendants \"[h]as anyone threatened you or forced you in any form or fashion or induced you to plead guilty in this case\" and \"[h]as anybody made any promises to any one of you to induce you to plea?\" To both of these questions the defendants answered no. Additionally, at the end of the colloquy, the court asked whether there was \"any reason why these pleas should not be accepted?\" All counsel for the defendants answered no.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If there were pressures from co-defendants or from the fraternal relationship that led to involuntariness, Nelson and Geraldo had adequate opportunity to say so. To the contrary, the defendants' answers to the court's questions indicate that they pled guilty of their own volition, fully aware of the rights they were relinquishing and the charges they were accepting. The defendants' \"declarations in open court carry a strong presumption of verity.\" <i>Blackledge v. Allison,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109648\"><a href=\"/opinion/109648/blackledge-v-allison/\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">63</span></a></span>, 73-74, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109648\"><a href=\"/opinion/109648/blackledge-v-allison/\"><span class=\"volume\">97</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

This case is more like <i>United States v. Sanchez-Barreto,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196929\"><a href=\"/opinion/196929/united-states-v-sanchez-barreto/\"><span class=\"volume\">93</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">17</span></a></span> (1st Cir.1996).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> In <i>Sanchez-Barreto,</i> the defendants contended that their pleas were involuntary because of their attorneys' recommendations to accept the plea bargains offered by the government on the morning of the first day of trial. The court recognized that \"[s]pecial Rule 11 requirements have been designed to minimize the significant risk that `involuntary' guilty pleas may be tendered in response to package plea bargain offers from the government.\" <i>Id.</i> at 23. This court found that the Rule 11 colloquy was adequate to satisfy the \"threshold voluntariness determinations for Rule 11(d) purposes,\" when each defendant repeatedly informed the district court that his guilty plea \"had not been coerced by <i>anyone</i> ....\" <i>Id.</i> (emphasis in the original). The court distinguished this acceptable colloquy from the unacceptable colloquy of <i>Martinez-Molina,</i> where the trial court restricted its inquiry to prosecutorial coercion. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if the Rule 11 inquiry could have been more probing, there is nothing in the record to suggest that either plea was involuntary due to the package nature of the deal. There is no indication from the Rule 11 colloquy that the defendants felt pressure from co-defendants or family members. <i>See Daniels,</i> 821 F.2d at 79 (holding the Rule 11 colloquy lacking when the judge was unaware of the package deal and the defendant answered questions during the colloquy in such a manner as to indicate that he was feeling some family pressure to plead guilty).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is true that in their later motions to withdraw, Nelson and Geraldo complained of pressure, but neither complained of pressure from the fact that the pleas were packaged. Had the issue been raised, the district court could have explored it at the hearing. Further, both defendants had the opportunity to take the stand to explain their concerns, which they declined to do.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even so, one might argue that a remand to the district court to hold a hearing would be appropriate to eliminate any concern. We decline that option. Even on appeal, defendants have not argued they have suffered harm or that involuntariness occurred as a result of this being a package deal. If brotherhood led to involuntary self-sacrifice, Nelson and Geraldo have never said so. If pressure from co-defendants coerced them into a deal, Nelson and Geraldo have never said so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Instead they even now offer only prejudice arguments unrelated to the risks of a package plea. Geraldo argues he was pressured because he had only 10 minutes to decide whether to accept the plea. There are two responses. First, the \"ten minute\" representation is not true. Plea negotiations took place before trial and for hours on the day of trial. Second, even if it were true that only ten minutes were afforded, the lack of time could be a source of pressure regardless of whether the plea offered was a package deal, and \"the strategic decision to plead guilty [is] not [necessarily] rendered involuntary by the anxieties and time pressures confronting [the defendant].\" <i>See United States v. Marrero-Rivera,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"197543\"><a href=\"/opinion/197543/united-states-v-marrero-rivera/\"><span class=\"volume\">124</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">342</span></a></span>, 350 (1st Cir. 1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When asked what Geraldo relied on to demonstrate involuntariness, he replied simply that the plea was a package deal, as though such package plea arrangements inherently cannot be voluntary. That is not the law. Additionally, we will not infer lack of voluntariness, as the defendant encourages us to do, from the mere fact that one co-defendant was his brother or the mere fact that many of his co-defendants received lighter sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nelson articulates a different concern, one which again is unrelated to the package nature of the plea. His concern stems from the pressure he was under because his Puerto Rico murder trial did not take place before his federal trial and the consequent need to plead on April 8 to the federal charge. Even this pressure does not render his plea involuntary. As the government points out, he was not charged with the murder in federal court. It is true the murder might be relevant conduct for federal sentencing purposes. Even were Nelson acquitted of the murder, as he was, the murder still could have been considered by the sentencing judge. <i>United States v.

De Alba Pagan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195565\"><a href=\"/opinion/195565/united-states-v-de-alba-pagan/\"><span class=\"volume\">33</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">125</span></a></span>, 130 (1st Cir.1994). To achieve functional equivalency, \"the court, the prosecutor, and the defendant must at the very least interact in a manner that shows clearly and convincingly that the defendant knew he had a right to speak on any subject of his choosing prior to the imposition of sentence.\" <i>Id.</i> at 129. Geraldo argues that because the prosecutor did not understand the allocution in Spanish and the court did not order the translation, it was impossible for the prosecutor to interact in the way envisioned in <i>De Alba Pagan.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This part of the case involves two statutes: The Jones Act, 48 U.S.C. &#167; 864, and the Court Reporter Act, 28 U.S.C. &#167; 753(b). The Jones Act provides that \"[a]ll proceedings in the United States District Court for the District of Puerto Rico shall be conducted in the English language,\" and the Court Reporter Act mandates that certain proceedings \"be recorded verbatim [including] all proceedings in criminal cases [held] in open court.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At Geraldo's sentencing, neither of these things happened. After the prosecutor offered his recommended sentence, the court asked Geraldo whether he had anything he wished to say. Geraldo read a written statement in Spanish. This statement was not translated by the court interpreter, and it was not transcribed into the record. However, the court was fluent in Spanish, and the handwritten statement itself was included in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Violations of these acts do not require automatic reversal. \"[N]othing prescribes automatic reversal of a defendant's convictions for non-compliance with [the Court Reporter Act]. Rather, to obtain reversal and a new trial, the defendant must demonstrate specific prejudice to his ability to perfect an appeal, beyond mere non-compliance with the Court Reporter Act.\" <i>United States v.

As to the Jones Act, we have reviewed these violations for plain error when they were not raised until appeal. <i>United States v.
