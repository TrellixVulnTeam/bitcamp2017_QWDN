Macari-Grillo on\nsupplemental brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 22, 2006\n\f            LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.         In Vázquez-Valentín v. Santiago-\n\nDíaz, 385 F.3d 23 (1st Cir. 2004) (Vázquez I), we reversed a jury's\n\nverdict that Diana Vázquez-Valentín (Vázquez) had been subjected to\n\npolitical discrimination by her former employers, the municipality\n\nof Toa Baja and its mayor and human resources director.                           We\n\nreviewed the denial of the defendants' Rule 50(a) motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law based on the sufficiency of the\n\nevidence, despite the defendants' failure to preserve that ground\n\nof appeal pursuant to Fedg. R. Civ. P. 50(b).1               Vázquez petitioned\n\nfor certiorari.    After its decision in Unitherm Food Sys., Inc. v.\n\nSwift-Eckrich, Inc., 126 S. Ct. 980 (2006), the Supreme Court\n\ngranted    Vázquez's    petition    for       certiorari,    vacated       our   2004\n\ndecision, and remanded the case to us for reconsideration.                       See\n\nVázquez-Valentín       v.   Santiago-Díaz,       126   S.    Ct.    1329    (2006).\n\nUnitherm    established      that   a    party     \"may     not    challenge     the\n\nsufficiency of the evidence on appeal on the basis of the District\n\n\n\n     1\n       During a jury trial under the federal rules, a party may\nmove during trial and/or at the conclusion of the evidence for\njudgment as a matter of law.      Fed. R. Civ. P. 50(a).    If the\ndistrict court denies a Rule 50(a) motion made at the close of all\nthe evidence, the party may submit a \"renewed\" motion, under Rule\n50(b), after the jury returns its verdict.       See also Proposed\nAmendment to Rule 50, Subdivisions (a) and (b), effective December\n1, 2006, absent contrary Congressional action, Advisory Committee\nNotes (\"Rule 50(b) is amended to permit renewal of any Rule 50(a)\nmotion for judgment as a matter of law, deleting the requirement\nthat a motion be made at the close of all the evidence.\"). In\naddition to not filing a Rule 50(b) motion, the defendants also did\nnot address the sufficiency or weight of the evidence in a motion\nfor a new trial pursuant to Rule 59.\n\n                                        -2-\n\fCourt's denial of its Rule 50(a) motion\" alone.   Unitherm, 126 S.\n\nCt. at 988.\n\n          Upon reconsideration, we conclude that the jury's verdict\n\nin favor of Vázquez must now be vacated because of the district\n\ncourt's exclusion of certain evidence presented by the defendants\n\n-- a point argued by the defendants in Vázquez I but not decided by\n\nus because of our focus on the sufficiency of the evidence.    Our\n\ndecision to vacate on this ground also requires that we remand this\n\ncase for further proceedings in the district court.\n\n                                I.\n\n          After the Supreme Court's remand, we instructed the\n\nparties to brief further \"the following three issues addressed in\n\nthe original appellate briefs: (1) the district court's evidentiary\n\nrulings, (2) the district court's order that the plaintiff be\n\nreinstated, and (3) the qualified immunity issue.\"     Despite our\n\ninstruction, the parties used much of their supplemental briefing\n\nto argue about the scope of the Supreme Court's remand order and of\n\nthe applicability of the Unitherm decision to this case.   Vázquez\n\nargues that we have to reinstate the jury's verdict in her favor in\n\nlight of the Supreme Court's decision.   The defendants argue that\n\nwe may still order judgment as a matter of law in their favor, on\n\nsufficiency of the evidence grounds.   We pause briefly to explain\n\nthat the parties have misunderstood the significance of the Supreme\n\nCourt's remand order.\n\n\n                               -3-\n\f            The complete text of the Supreme Court's order in this\n\ncase is as follows:\n\n            The petition for writ of certiorari is\n            granted. The judgment is vacated and the case\n            is remanded to the United States Court of\n            Appeals for the First Circuit for further\n            consideration in light of Unitherm Food Sys.\n            v. Swift Eckrich, 546 U.S. ___ (2006).\n\nSupreme Court orders of this type, colloquially termed \"GVRs,\"\n\nmeaning \"granted, vacated, and remanded,\" do not resolve a case.\n\nSee Gonzalez v. Justices of the Municipal Court of Boston, 420 F.3d\n\n5, 7 (1st Cir. 2005).       Rather, they tell us that we misapprehended\n\nthe law when we entered the judgment now vacated, and that we must\n\nreconsider the case now remanded to us in light of the Supreme\n\nCourt's   opinion.         Id.    Sometimes,    despite     the   intervening\n\nprecedent, we will enter the same judgment because, after due\n\nconsideration, we conclude that the new precedent does not require\n\na different outcome.        See, e.g., United States v. Burnette, 423\n\nF.3d 22 (1st Cir. 2005).         Other times, the intervening precedent\n\nwill result in a different outcome.\n\n            Here, the Supreme Court's decision in Unitherm does not\n\npermit us to conclude once again that a judgment must be entered\n\nfor the defendants because of the insufficiency of Vázquez's\n\nevidence.    Under Unitherm, we cannot review the denial of a Rule\n\n50(a) motion based on the sufficiency of the evidence when the\n\nparty   appealing    the    verdict   failed   to   renew   its   sufficiency\n\nchallenge in the district court pursuant to Rule 50(b).                   See\n\n                                      -4-\n\fUnitherm, 126 S. Ct. at 987 (\"[A] party's Rule 50(a) motion . . .\n\ncannot be appealed unless that motion is renewed pursuant to Rule\n\n50(b).\").\n\n               Vázquez     is   equally   wrong    in       arguing   that   we     must\n\nreinstate the jury's verdict.             In our 2004 decision, we did not\n\nreach the merits of several of the defendants' arguments for a new\n\ntrial       because   we   focused     instead    on    the    sufficiency     of   the\n\nevidence.       In fact, we noted that we had doubts about the district\n\ncourt's evidentiary rulings but we did \"not have to decide the\n\nissue.\"       Vázquez I, 385 F.3d at 25 n.1.                In light of the remand\n\nfrom the Supreme Court, we must now address the rulings that\n\nprompted those doubts.           See Gonzalez, 420 F.3d at 8.2\n\n                                          II.\n\n               We recited the facts at length in Vázquez I, 385 F.3d at\n\n23-29.       We incorporate those facts by reference, summarizing only\n\nbriefly       the   details     most   pertinent       to   our   discussion      here.3\n\nVázquez claimed that she was demoted as a result of the defendants'\n\n\n\n     2\n        Unitherm does not mean that a party has to file a post\nverdict motion in order to preserve an evidentiary objection for\nappeal. Unitherm does not change the rule \"that once the district\ncourt 'makes a definitive ruling on the record admitting . . .\nevidence, either at or before trial, a party need not renew an\nobjection . . . to preserve a claim of error for appeal.'\" Zachar\nv. Lee, 363 F.3d 70, 75 (1st Cir. 2004) (quoting Fed. R. Evid.\n103(a)(2)).    See also Wright & Graham, Federal Practice and\nProcedure: Evidence 2d §§ 5032-5034.\n        3\n      To be clear, we do not rely on the vacated legal conclusions\nin Vázquez I for our decision here.\n\n                                          -5-\n\fanimus against her political affiliation.              The defendants, members\n\nof the municipal administration of Toa Baja that took charge in\n\nJanuary 2001, claimed that she was demoted because the previous\n\nmunicipal       administration     had    promoted    her    illegally    and   the\n\nCommonwealth of Puerto Rico had mandated corrective action.\n\n            In support of this defense, the defendants invoked an\n\naudit of municipal personnel practices that the Comptroller of\n\nPuerto Rico had completed during the last months of the previous\n\nadministration.        See Vázquez I, 385 F.3d at 25 n.1.                The audit\n\nrevealed that Toa Baja had run afoul of numerous Commonwealth laws\n\nrelating to the appointment and promotion of municipal employees.\n\nUnder Puerto Rico law, \"all municipal jobs are governed by so-\n\ncalled job classification plans that are adopted locally.                    These\n\nplans set forth the occupational groups and personnel structure of\n\nthe    municipality,       including     the   primary     responsibilities     and\n\nemployment requirements for each position in city government.\"\n\nVázquez    I,    385   F.3d   at   26.     These     job   classification    plans\n\ngenerally must be approved by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\n\nbefore they can be implemented. Once a job classification plan has\n\nbeen approved, municipalities normally must use a merit system to\n\nfill      the     career      positions        the   plan     creates.          See\n\nGonzalez-De-Blasini v. Family Dept., 377 F.3d 81, 86 (1st Cir.\n\n2004).     \"Under this system, career employees must, among other\n\n\n\n\n                                         -6-\n\frequirements, pass a competitive examination to be eligible for\n\nappointment or promotion to a career position.\"                  Id.\n\n               According to the Comptroller's audit report, Toa Baja had\n\nadhered    neither      to   the   requirement      that   it    submit    its   job\n\nclassification plans to the Commonwealth for approval, nor the\n\nrequirement that it use a merit system to fill jobs and make\n\npromotions. The municipality's main structural violations were its\n\nuse of an unapproved 1997 job classification plan (Toa Baja's most\n\nrecent properly-approved plan dated from 1991) and its habit of\n\nignoring the normal merit-based appointment system in favor of a\n\nsystem    by    which   relatives    and   allies    of    the   mayor    routinely\n\nreceived desirable posts.\n\n               Under Puerto Rico law, personnel appointments made in\n\nviolation of Commonwealth laws and regulations normally \"are null\n\nand void ab initio.” Gonzalez-De-Blasini, 377 F.3d at 86 (internal\n\nquotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the Comptroller's audit\n\nreport \"recommended\" that the municipality take corrective action\n\nto undo any illegal personnel actions. The same report warned that\n\n\"[f]ailure to heed a recommendation in an audit report from this\n\nOffice, without just cause, may constitute a violation of [Puerto\n\nRico law].\"\n\n               In reaction to the audit report, the outgoing municipal\n\nadministration began reviewing personnel files and, according to a\n\nletter it sent to Commonwealth officials, \"encountered cases of\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\femployees that did not meet the requirements of their position.\"\n\nCommonwealth officials responded that these employees would \"need\n\nto be re-routed to a classification for which they meet the\n\nrequirements.\"         Before   any   reclassifications      took    place,   the\n\nNovember 2000 election happened, and the previous administration --\n\nthe one responsible for the violations cited by the audit report --\n\nwas replaced by an administration headed by the defendant mayor.\n\n            Upon taking office, the defendants made several inquiries\n\nto     Commonwealth     officials     about   the    audit   report    and    its\n\nrecommendations.       In particular, the defendants asked whether all\n\nemployee appointments pursuant to the municipality's 1997 personnel\n\nplan, which had not been properly approved, would have to be\n\nrescinded. The Commonwealth's answer was that \"the 1997 plans have\n\nno validity\" so \"we recommend [] the alternative of reclassifying\n\n[the affected employees] into positions for which they meet the\n\nrequirements in accordance with the 1991 plan.\"              In light of this\n\nguidance, the new administration adopted a corrective action plan\n\nthat    called   for    a   thorough    review      of   personnel    files   and\n\nreassignment of any improperly-promoted employees.\n\n            The resulting reviews and reclassifications had a large\n\neffect on municipal employees.           As we noted in Vázquez I, by the\n\ntime of the trial, \"around six hundred files had been evaluated.\"\n\n385 F.3d at 26.       This number represented slightly less than half of\n\nthe municipality's workforce.           Of those employees whose files had\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fbeen evaluated, roughly half \"had sought an informal hearing\n\nregarding the personnel action that resulted from the review.\" Id.\n\nVázquez was one of the many employees who was reclassified as a\n\nresult of the new administration's review and who sought a hearing.\n\n          Vázquez started working for Toa Baja while a college\n\nstudent in 1985, as a \"transitory\" office clerk. She was appointed\n\nto the career position of \"Office Worker / Typist I\" in 1989.    She\n\nheld that post until the summer of 1993, when she was elevated to\n\n\"Secretary III.\"    Less than two months later, she was promoted\n\nagain to \"Assistant Director.\"   The post \"Assistant Director\" was\n\nlater renamed \"Executive Director II,\" the position Vázquez held\n\nwhen the new administration took office.   See Vázquez I, 385 F.3d\n\nat 28.   When the defendants reviewed Vázquez's personnel records,\n\nthey decided that both of her 1993 promotions had been in violation\n\nof the 1991 plan.   Specifically, the defendants later explained to\n\nVázquez that her promotion from \"Office Worker / Typist I\" to\n\n\"Secretary III\" had been improper because she had not had the\n\nrequired courses in business skills or typing, and because she had\n\nnot spent the required year as a \"Secretary II\" or equivalent.   Her\n\nsecond promotion, they said, was improper for want of the required\n\nexperience and because it had occurred so soon after the previous\n\npromotion.   In the spring of 2001, the defendants informed Vázquez\n\nthat the illegality of her 1993 promotions meant that she would\n\nhave to be demoted to the position of \"Office Worker / Typist I,\"\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fthe same post that she had assumed in 1989.         That job had no\n\nsupervisory responsibilities and paid less than half as much as her\n\n\"Executive Director II\" position.\n\n           Vázquez protested that she was a college graduate with\n\nmany years of experience in municipal government, and that her\n\ncollege transcript clearly showed that she had taken typewriting\n\nand shorthand courses.   (Apparently, the transcript was not in her\n\npersonnel file.)     When she learned that she would be demoted\n\ndespite her educational credentials and experience, Vázquez asked\n\nfor and was granted a hearing before an administrative hearing\n\nofficer.   Vázquez later testified that the hearing lasted about\n\nfive minutes. The hearing officer determined in a written decision\n\nthat Vázquez had been hired and promoted illegally.     Shortly after\n\nher demotion became effective, Vázquez resigned her new position.\n\nSuspecting that the true reason for her demotion was her political\n\naffiliation with the party that had lost the 2000 election, she\n\ntimely filed this case alleging political discrimination.\n\n                                   III.\n\n           At the trial in April and May 2002, to demonstrate that\n\nthey had acted in good faith in demoting Vázquez, the defendants\n\nsought to introduce as evidence the Comptroller's audit and the\n\ncommunications     between   the     municipal   administration   and\n\nCommonwealth officials that followed.      The defendants made these\n\nefforts during the testimony of their two principal witnesses,\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fdefendant    Milagros      Delgado-Ortiz        (Delgado),     who    was        the    new\n\nadministration's human resources director, and the defendant mayor,\n\nVictor Santiago-Díaz (Díaz).              During Delgado's testimony, the\n\ndefendants attempted to introduce the audit report itself and a\n\nfour-page letter to her from the Commonwealth Office of Municipal\n\nAffairs explaining that the 1997 personnel plan was invalid.                            The\n\ndefendants    also     attempted    to    have   Delgado      testify       as    to    the\n\ncontents     of    these   documents.       During      Díaz's     testimony,           the\n\ndefendants        attempted    to   introduce      a     letter      Díaz        sent    to\n\nCommonwealth officials asking what the municipality should do in\n\nlight   of    the    earlier    documents,       and    two   letters        from       the\n\nCommonwealth in response, giving the advice that the municipality\n\nshould reclassify its employees.                Alternatively, the defendants\n\nsought to have Díaz testify about these letters.\n\n             The    district    court     excluded      all   of   this      proffered\n\nevidence on two grounds. The district court cited the hearsay rule\n\nand also noted generally that it did not want to expose the jury to\n\nthe legal conclusions in the documents.                Referring specifically to\n\nthe letter from the Commonwealth officials to Delgado, the district\n\ncourt stated that the document \"is a conclusion of law and is\n\nhearsay [and] for this reason [] cannot be admitted as evidence.\"\n\nThe district court also expressed concern that the audit report\n\ncould be unfairly prejudicial to Vázquez because it contained many\n\nstatements that did not pertain to her appointment specifically.\n\n\n                                         -11-\n\fSee Fed. R. Evid. 403. On appeal, Vázquez echoes these rationales,\n\nwhich are unpersuasive.\n\n            As the defendants point out, the excluded documents were\n\nnot hearsay because they were not \"offered in evidence to prove the\n\ntruth of the matter asserted.\"          Fed. R. Evid. 801(c); see also\n\nRamírez-Rodriguez v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,\n\n425 F.3d 67, 76-77 (1st Cir. 2005).             We indicated as much in\n\nVázquez   I:    \"The   exclusion   of   these   documents   as   hearsay   is\n\ntroubling.     So crucial to the defendants' case, and offered as an\n\nexplanation for the personnel actions undertaken by the defendants\n\nrather than for the truth of the personnel irregularities described\n\nin the documents, these documents are not hearsay, and they were\n\nhighly relevant.       Their exclusion might well have justified a new\n\ntrial.\" 385 F.3d at 25 n.1.             The \"matters asserted\" in the\n\ndocuments were that many Toa Baja employees had been hired without\n\ndue regard for procedures, that the Mayor and his administration\n\nwould be liable under the Commonwealth's ethics laws if they did\n\nnot take measures to remedy the hiring abuses of the previous\n\nadministration, and that the approach of reviewing personnel files\n\nand reclassifying employees was consistent with the Commonwealth's\n\nguidance.      The defendants \"offer[ed] these assertions to explain\n\nthe basis for [their] decision to [demote Vázquez].\"               Ramírez-\n\nRodriguez, 425 F.3d at 77.         The issue at trial was not whether\n\nVázquez was appointed properly or whether the new administration\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\fwas legally liable for the abuses of its predecessors. Rather, the\n\nissue for the jury was whether the defendants had demoted Vázquez\n\nas a result of her political affiliation, or for some other reason.\n\n\"In short, the documents were not offered to prove\" that the new\n\nadministration was legally obligated to demote Vázquez, \"but rather\n\nto demonstrate that h[er] superiors had reason, based on a thorough\n\ninvestigation, to believe that [they were required to demote her].\"\n\nId.   Accordingly, the documents were not hearsay.\n\n           The suggestion that the documents were inadmissible legal\n\nopinions fails for similar reasons.          The documents did contain\n\nlegal conclusions about the propriety of the previous municipal\n\nadministration's personnel decisions. But this is not a case about\n\nthe propriety of Vázquez's appointment.4         The critical issue in\n\nthis case -- the ultimate issue for the jury -- was determining the\n\ndefendants'   motivations   for   demoting   Vázquez.   The   documents\n\noffered no legal conclusions about those motivations. Rather, they\n\ndescribed a neutral evaluation of the municipality's personnel\n\npolicies that, if truly relied upon, provided a non-discriminatory\n\nbasis for Vázquez's demotion.     As we explained in a case involving\n\na similar situation, while the documents were \"not admissible for\n\n\n      4\n        Vázquez's due process claim, which the district court\ndismissed on the defendants' Rule 50(a) motion, after the\npresentation of evidence but before the case went to the jury, also\ndid not hinge on the propriety of her appointment. As the district\ncourt noted, Vázquez's claim was \"based upon the theory that [her\npre-demotion] hearing was previously determined and was in and of\nitself a sham.\"\n\n                                  -13-\n\fthe purpose of proving what obligations the law imposed upon the\n\nMayor, [they were] admissible to show the Mayor's understanding at\n\nthe   time   and     his   ensuing   state     of   mind.\"   Gómez    v.   Rivera\n\nRodríguez, 344 F.3d 103, 115 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n             Gómez    also    refutes    Vázquez's      suggestion    that    the\n\ndocuments could have been excluded, in toto, pursuant to Rule 403.\n\nIn Gómez we noted that:\n\n             The Rule 403 balancing test applies statement\n             by statement. See Kassel v. Gannett Co., 875\n             F.2d 935, 952 (1st Cir.1989) (noting that the\n             trial court “must balance the prejudicial\n             effect and probative value of each statement\n             offered”). To use the rule as an instrument\n             for the wholesale exclusion of a percipient\n             witness's testimony would be tantamount to\n             allowing the presider to cut down the entire\n             tree out of fear that some of the fruit might\n             prove rotten. Rule 403 requires more delicate\n             pruning of evidentiary proffers. See id.\n             (warning against throwing “out the baby with\n             the bath water”).\n\nId. at 115 (footnote omitted); see also id. at 115 n.7 (\"[T]he need\n\nto limit the jury's use of certain testimony does not give the\n\ntrial court carte blanche to exclude it entirely.\").                 Here, there\n\nwould be a similar calculus.         If, as the district court suggested,\n\nthere was some material in the audit report that was unfairly\n\nprejudicial to Vázquez, the remedy should have been to redact the\n\noffending statements from the jury's view, not to exclude the\n\ndocument entirely.\n\n             Anticipating the possible rejection of her arguments,\n\nVázquez asserts that any error in excluding the documents was not\n\n                                        -14-\n\fprejudicial   to   the   defendants   given   other   material   that   was\n\nadmitted in evidence.      She points particularly to the statements\n\nthat the district court read to the jury summarizing some of the\n\nexcluded material. After refusing to let Delgado testify as to the\n\ncontents of the audit report, the district court told the jury\n\nthat:\n\n          The Comptroller of the Commonwealth of Puerto\n          Rico performed an audit in which his staff\n          examined a sample of personnel files.     The\n          report stated that certain irregularities in\n          the placement of some employees for the\n          Municipality of Toa Baja had been found. The\n          report should not be taken as evidence of the\n          truth or veracity of the statement found\n          therein, but rather only that the report was\n          made.\n\nIn regard to the letter to Delgado about the illegality of the 1997\n\npersonnel plan, the district court told the jury that:\n\n          Mrs.   Delgado   sought   advice   from  [the\n          Commonwealth]. Mrs Delgado received a letter\n          in reply to this petition for advice.     The\n          letter received by Mrs. Delgado is evidence\n          only that she sought and received advice. The\n          letter in no way proves that the advice she\n          received was true or legal.\n\nThe district court also told the jury, as part of its charge, that:\n\n          . . . according to the defendant, plaintiff's\n          demotion was based on legitimate policy and\n          administrative consideration devoid of any\n          political motivation. They contend that their\n          demotion   was   a  direct   result   of  the\n          implementation of a plan to reorganize the\n          working positions within the municipality.\n          Defendants further claim that the Comptroller\n          of   Puerto    Rico   concluded    that   the\n          municipality's previous administration had\n\n\n                             -15-\n\f           illegally appointed many employees and had\n           illegally raised the compensation of others.\n\nFinally, Vázquez points out that during cross-examination of her\n\nown testimony, the defendants persuaded the district court that\n\nVázquez should read to the jury a letter the defendants had sent\n\nher after she submitted her resignation.   The letter stated:\n\n           I wish to clarify that the undertakings being\n           carried out by this municipality with respect\n           to personnel transactions are due to the\n           findings made by the Comptroller of Puerto\n           Rico in his audit report [] and the corrective\n           action plan, which we are required to submit\n           to said office, correcting the findings of\n           irregularities in the proceedings involving\n           appointment and selection of personnel.\n\n           Although these statements by the court and the admission\n\nof this letter reflect a laudable attempt by the court to be fair\n\nto all parties, they were not enough to render the exclusions by\n\nthe court inconsequential.    The court's third statement and the\n\nletter to Vázquez merely paraphrase the defendants' position at\n\ntrial.   They did nothing to show that the Commonwealth authorities\n\nhad in fact given the legal opinions in question.     The district\n\ncourt's summaries of the audit and one letter also failed to put\n\nthe jury on notice of the contents of the excluded documents.\n\nFirst, the district court did not allow the jury to know that the\n\naudit report had contained the admonition that \"[f]ailure to heed\n\na recommendation in an audit report from this Office, without just\n\ncause, may constitute a violation of [Puerto Rico law].\"    Second,\n\nthe court's summary of the letter to Delgado did not let the jury\n\n                                -16-\n\fknow that the Commonwealth had recommended \"reclassifying [the\n\naffected       employees]     into    positions      for   which   they   meet   the\n\nrequirements in accordance with the 1991 plan,\" which is precisely\n\nthe course the defendants claimed that they took in regard to\n\nVázquez.       Indeed, the district court's summary of the letter did\n\nnot even let the jury know that the Commonwealth had advised the\n\ndefendants to reclassify employees at all. In short, the summaries\n\nby the court simply were insufficient to convey the seriousness\n\nwith which the Commonwealth had insisted that the defendants remedy\n\nthe previous administration's abuses, and the specific measures\n\nthey       urged   the   defendants    to    take.     For   these   reasons,    the\n\nexclusion of the documentary evidence was not harmless, and we must\n\nvacate the jury's verdict and remand for a new trial.5\n\n                                            IV.\n\n               Several times during the proceedings, the individual\n\ndefendants asked the district court to rule that they were entitled\n\nto qualified immunity.           They asked for summary judgment on that\n\nground, a request that the district court denied because there were\n\ndisputed       issues    of   fact    relating    to   the   defendants'    actual\n\nmotivations for Vázquez's demotion.               The district court explained\n\nthat the defendants would not be entitled to qualified immunity if\n\n\n\n       5\n       Given this outcome, there is no need for us to discuss the\ndefendants' contentions that the district court committed error in\nmaking certain remarks during the trial or in ordering the\ndefendant to reinstate Vázquez as an Executive Director II.\n\n                                         -17-\n\fthe   jury   concluded   that       they   had    demoted   Vázquez     because   of\n\npolitical animus.        In the court's view, such a finding would\n\nestablish that an objectively reasonable municipal official would\n\nnot have acted as the defendants did.6              The defendants also sought\n\nto invoke qualified immunity at trial, asking the district court to\n\nrule in their favor on that issue after Vázquez's case in chief and\n\nagain at the close of the evidence.                The district court reserved\n\nits   decision   pending      the    jury's      findings   on   the    defendants'\n\nmotivations.\n\n             In the end, according to the verdict form, the jury found\n\nthat Vázquez's \"political affiliation was a substantial or a\n\nmotivating factor in the decision to demote her from her position\n\nas Executive Director II.\"             On the basis of this finding, the\n\ndistrict     court   denied     the    defendants'      motion    for    qualified\n\nimmunity.7     We have now concluded that the jury verdict must be\n\n\n\n      6\n        \"This Court has identified a three-step process for\nevaluating qualified immunity claims: (1) whether the claimant has\nalleged the deprivation of an actual constitutional right; (2)\nwhether the right was clearly established at the time of the\nalleged action or inaction; and (3) if both of these questions are\nanswered in the affirmative, whether an objectively reasonable\nofficial would have believed that the action taken violated that\nclearly established constitutional right.\"     Wilson v. City of\nBoston, 421 F.3d 45, 52-53 (1st Cir. 2005).       In the district\ncourt's view, because a municipal employee's right to be free of\npolitical discrimination is a clearly-established constitutional\nright, only the third part of the test was at issue in this case.\n      7\n       The defendants did not make any post-trial motion on the\nissue; the district court issued a thorough written order denying\nqualified immunity the same day the jury returned its verdict.\n\n                                       -18-\n\fvacated because of the exclusion of evidence that the jury was\n\nentitled to hear.         Given the centrality of the jury verdict to the\n\ndistrict court's denial of qualified immunity, the district court\n\nshould reexamine the qualified immunity issue as well.                  Indeed, we\n\nnote here, as we did in Vázquez I, that the same district court\n\njudge    who    heard     this   case   presided    over   a   second   political\n\ndiscrimination case from Toa Baja, involving the same defendants\n\nand a group of plaintiffs who brought claims similar to Vázquez's.\n\nSee Lugo v. Toa Baja, 329 F. Supp. 2d 221 (D.P.R. 2004).                  In Lugo,\n\nwhich reached trial after our decision in Gómez, the district court\n\nappropriately allowed in evidence the same documents that it\n\nexcluded in this case.           Presumably in light of that evidence, the\n\ndistrict court concluded that the defendants in Lugo (the same\n\ndefendants as here) were entitled to qualified immunity.                      The\n\ndocuments that we discussed above clearly are relevant to the\n\nqualified immunity analysis and should be evaluated by the district\n\ncourt when it considers that issue again.\n\n               Judgment    vacated.      Remanded   for    further   proceedings\n\nconsistent with this opinion.             The parties shall bear their own\n\ncosts.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -19-\n\f",

We reviewed the denial of the defendants' Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law based on the sufficiency of the evidence, despite the defendants' failure to preserve that ground of appeal pursuant to Fed.

V&#225;zquez argues that we have to reinstate the jury's verdict in her favor in light of the Supreme Court's decision. The defendants argue that we may still order judgment as a matter of law in their favor, on sufficiency of the evidence grounds.

Justices of the Municipal</i> <i>Court of Boston,</i> 420 F.3d 5, 7 (1st Cir.2005). Rather, they tell us that we misapprehended the law when we entered the judgment now vacated, and that we must reconsider the case now remanded to us in light of the Supreme Court's opinion. <i>Id.</i> Sometimes, despite the intervening precedent, we will enter the same judgment because, after due consideration, we conclude that the new precedent does not require a different outcome. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

In light of the remand from the Supreme Court, we must now address the rulings that prompted those doubts. <i>See Gonzalez,</i> 420 F.3d at 8.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recited the facts at length in <i>V&#225;zquez I,</i> 385 F.3d at 23-29. We incorporate those facts by reference, summarizing only briefly the details most pertinent to our discussion here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> V&#225;zquez claimed that she was demoted as a result of the defendants' animus against her political affiliation. The defendants, members of the municipal administration of Toa Baja that took charge in January 2001, claimed that she was demoted because the previous municipal administration had promoted her illegally and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico had mandated corrective action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of this defense, the defendants invoked an audit of municipal personnel practices that the Comptroller of Puerto Rico had completed during the last months of the previous administration. <i>See V&#225;zquez I,</i> 385 F.3d at 25 n. 1. The audit revealed that Toa Baja had run afoul of numerous Commonwealth laws relating to the appointment and promotion of municipal employees. Under Puerto Rico law, \"all municipal jobs are governed by so-called job classification plans that are adopted locally. These plans set forth the occupational groups and personnel structure of the municipality, including the primary responsibilities and employment requirements for each position in city government.\" <i>V&#225;zquez I,</i> 385 F.3d at 26. These job classification plans generally must be approved by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico before they can be implemented. Once a job classification plan has been approved, municipalities normally must use a merit system to fill the career positions the plan creates. <i>See Gonzalez-De-Blasini v. Family Dept.,</i> 377 F.3d 81, 86 (1st Cir.2004). \"Under this system, career employees must, among other requirements, pass a competitive examination to be eligible for appointment or promotion to a career position.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the Comptroller's audit report, Toa Baja had adhered neither to the requirement that it submit its job classification plans to the Commonwealth for approval, nor the requirement that it use a merit system to fill jobs and make promotions. The municipality's main structural violations were its use of an unapproved 1997 job classification plan (Toa Baja's most recent properly-approved plan dated from 1991) and its habit of ignoring the normal merit-based appointment system in favor of a system by which relatives and allies of the mayor routinely received desirable posts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Puerto Rico law, personnel appointments made in violation of Commonwealth laws and regulations normally \"are null and void <i>ab initio.</i>\" <i>Gonzalez-De-Blasini,</i> 377 F.3d at 86 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the Comptroller's audit report \"recommended\" that the municipality take corrective action to undo any illegal personnel actions. The same report warned that \"[f]ailure to heed a recommendation in an audit report from this Office, without just cause, may constitute a violation of [Puerto Rico law].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaction to the audit report, the outgoing municipal administration began reviewing personnel files and, according to a letter it sent to Commonwealth officials, \"encountered cases of employees that did not meet the requirements of their position.\" Commonwealth officials responded that these employees would \"need to be re-routed to a classification for which they meet the requirements.\" Before any reclassifications took place, the November 2000 election happened, and the previous administration &#8212; the one responsible for the violations cited by the audit report &#8212; was replaced by an administration headed by the defendant mayor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon taking office, the defendants made several inquiries to Commonwealth officials about the audit report and its recommendations. In particular, the defendants asked whether all employee appointments pursuant to the municipality's 1997 personnel plan, which had not been properly approved, would have to be rescinded. The Commonwealth's answer was that \"the 1997 plans have no validity\" so \"we recommend [] the alternative of reclassifing [the affected employees] into positions for which they meet the requirements in accordance with the 1991 plan.\" In light of this guidance, the new administration adopted a corrective action plan that called for a thorough review of personnel files and reassignment of any improperly-promoted employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The resulting reviews and reclassifications had a large effect on municipal employees. As we noted in <i>V&#225;zquez I,</i> by the time of the trial, \"around six hundred files had been evaluated.\" 385 F.3d at 26. This number represented slightly less than half of the municipality's workforce. Of those employees whose files had been evaluated, roughly half \"had sought an informal hearing regarding the personnel action that resulted from the review.\" <i>Id.</i> V&#225;zquez was one of the many employees who was reclassified as a result of the new administration's review and who sought a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez started working for Toa Baja while a college student in 1985, as a \"transitory\" office clerk. She was appointed to the career position of \"Office Worker / Typist I\" in 1989. She held that post until the summer of 1993, when she was elevated to \"Secretary III.\" Less than two months later, she was promoted again to \"Assistant Director.\" The post \"Assistant Director\" was later renamed \"Executive Director II,\" the position V&#225;zquez held when the new administration took office. <i>See V&#225;zquez I,</i> 385 F.3d at 28. When the defendants reviewed V&#225;zquez's personnel records, they decided that both of her 1993 promotions had been in violation of the 1991 plan. Specifically, the defendants later explained to V&#225;zquez that her promotion from \"Office Worker / Typist I\" to \"Secretary III\" had been improper because she had not had the required courses in business skills or typing, and because she had not spent the required year as a \"Secretary II\" or equivalent. Her second promotion, they said, was improper for want of the required experience and because it had occurred so soon after the previous promotion. In the spring of 2001, the defendants informed V&#225;zquez that the illegality of her 1993 promotions meant that she would have to be demoted to the position of \"Office Worker / Typist I,\" the same post that she had assumed in 1989. That job had no supervisory responsibilities and paid less than half as much as her \"Executive Director II\" position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez protested that she was a college graduate with many years of experience in municipal government, and that her college transcript clearly showed that she had taken typewriting and shorthand courses. (Apparently, the transcript was not in her personnel file.) When she learned that she would be demoted despite her educational credentials and experience, V&#225;zquez asked for and was granted a hearing before an administrative hearing officer. V&#225;zquez later testified that the hearing lasted about five minutes. The hearing officer determined in a written decision that V&#225;zquez had been hired and promoted illegally. Shortly after her demotion became effective, V&#225;zquez resigned her new position. Suspecting that the true reason for her demotion was her political affiliation with the party that had lost the 2000 election, she timely filed this case alleging political discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the trial in April and May 2002, to demonstrate that they had acted in good faith in demoting V&#225;zquez, the defendants sought to introduce as evidence the Comptroller's audit and the communications between the municipal administration and Commonwealth officials that followed. The defendants made these efforts during the testimony of their two principal witnesses, defendant Milagros Delgado-Ortiz (Delgado), who was the new administration's human resources director, and the defendant mayor, Victor Santiago-D&#237;az (D&#237;az). During Delgado's testimony, the defendants attempted to introduce the audit report itself and a four-page letter to her from the Commonwealth Office of Municipal Affairs explaining that the 1997 personnel plan was invalid. The defendants also attempted to have Delgado testify as to the contents of these documents. During D&#237;az's testimony, the defendants attempted to introduce a letter D&#237;az sent to Commonwealth officials asking what the municipality should do in light of the earlier documents, and two letters from the Commonwealth in response, giving the advice that the municipality should reclassify its employees. Alternatively, the defendants sought to have D&#237;az testify about these letters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court excluded all of this proffered evidence on two grounds. The district court cited the hearsay rule and also noted generally that it did not want to expose the jury to the legal conclusions in the documents. Referring specifically to the letter from the Commonwealth officials to Delgado, the district court stated that the document \"is a conclusion of law and is hearsay [and] for this reason [] cannot be admitted as evidence.\" The district court also expressed concern that the audit report could be unfairly prejudicial to V&#225;zquez because it contained many statements that did not pertain to her appointment specifically. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403. On appeal, V&#225;zquez echoes these rationales, which are unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the defendants point out, the excluded documents were not hearsay because they were not \"offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(c); <i>see also Ram&#237;rez-Rodriguez v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</i> 425 F.3d 67, 76-77 (1st Cir.2005). We indicated as much in <i>V&#225;zquez I:</i> \"The exclusion of these documents as hearsay is troubling. So crucial to the defendants' case, and offered as an explanation for the personnel actions undertaken by the defendants rather than for the truth of the personnel irregularities described in the documents, these documents are not hearsay, and they were highly relevant. Their exclusion might well have justified a new trial.\" 385 F.3d at 25 n. 1. The \"matters asserted\" in the documents were that many Toa Baja employees had been hired without due regard for procedures, that the Mayor and his administration would be liable under the Commonwealth's ethics laws if they did not take measures to remedy the hiring abuses of the previous administration, and that the approach of reviewing personnel files and reclassifying employees was consistent with the Commonwealth's guidance. The defendants \"offer[ed] these assertions to explain the basis for [their] decision to [demote V&#225;zquez].\" <i>Ram&#237;rez Rodriguez,</i> 425 F.3d at 77. The issue at trial was not whether V&#225;zquez was appointed properly or whether the new administration was legally liable for the abuses of its predecessors. Rather, the issue for the jury was whether the defendants had demoted V&#225;zquez as a result of her political affiliation, or for some other reason. \"In short, the documents were not offered to prove\" that the new administration was legally obligated to demote V&#225;zquez, \"but rather to demonstrate that h[er] superiors had reason, based on a thorough investigation, to believe that [they were required to demote her].\" <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, the documents were not hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suggestion that the documents were inadmissible legal opinions fails for similar reasons. The documents did contain legal conclusions about the propriety of the previous municipal administration's personnel decisions. But this is not a case about the propriety of V&#225;zquez's appointment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The critical issue in this case-the ultimate issue for the jury &#8212; was determining the defendants' motivations for demoting V&#225;zquez. The documents offered no legal conclusions about those motivations. Rather, they described a neutral evaluation of the municipality's personnel policies that, if truly relied upon, provided a non-discriminatory basis for V&#225;zquez's demotion. As we explained in a case involving a similar situation, while the documents were \"not admissible for the purpose of proving what obligations the law imposed upon the Mayor, [they were] admissible to show the Mayor's understanding at the time and his ensuing state of mind.\" <i>G&#243;mez v. Rivera Rodr&#237;guez,</i> 344 F.3d 103, 115 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>G&#243;mez</i> also refutes V&#225;zquez's suggestion that the documents could have been excluded, <i>in toto,</i> pursuant to Rule 403. In <i>G&#243;mez</i> we noted that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rule 403 balancing test applies statement by statement. See <i>Kassel v. Gannett Co.,</i> 875 F.2d 935, 952 (1st Cir.1989) (noting that the trial court \"must balance the prejudicial effect and probative value of each statement offered\"). To use the rule as an instrument for the wholesale exclusion of a percipient witness's testimony would be tantamount to allowing the presider to cut down the entire tree out of fear that some of the fruit might prove rotten. Rule 403 requires more delicate pruning of evidentiary proffers. <i>See id.</i> (warning against throwing \"out the baby with the bath water\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 115 (footnote omitted); <i>see also id.</i> at 115 n. 7 (\"[T]he need to limit the jury's use of certain testimony does not give the trial court carte blanche to exclude it entirely.\"). Here, there would be a similar calculus. If, as the district court suggested, there was some material in the audit report that was unfairly prejudicial to V&#225;zquez, the remedy should have been to redact the offending statements from the jury's view, not to exclude the document entirely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anticipating the possible rejection of her arguments, V&#225;zquez asserts that any error in excluding the documents was not prejudicial to the defendants given other material that was admitted in evidence. She points particularly to the statements that the district court read to the jury summarizing some of the excluded material. After refusing to let Delgado testify as to the contents of the audit report, the district court told the jury that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Comptroller of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico performed an audit in which his staff examined a sample of personnel files. The report stated that certain irregularities in the placement of some employees for the Municipality of Toa Baja had been found. The report should not be taken as evidence of the truth or veracity of the statement found therein, but rather only that the report was made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In regard to the letter to Delgado about the illegality of the 1997 personnel plan, the district court told the jury that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Delgado sought advice from [the Commonwealth]. Mrs Delgado received a letter in reply to this petition for advice. The letter received by Mrs. Delgado is evidence only that she sought and received advice. The letter in no way proves that the advice she received was true or legal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also told the jury, as part of its charge, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . according to the defendant, plaintiff's demotion was based on legitimate policy and administrative consideration devoid of any political motivation. They contend that their demotion was a direct result of the implementation of a plan to reorganize the working positions within the municipality. Defendants further claim that the Comptroller of Puerto Rico concluded that the municipality's previous administration had illegally appointed many employees and had illegally raised the compensation of others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, V&#225;zquez points out that during cross-examination of her own testimony, the defendants persuaded the district court that V&#225;zquez should read to the jury a letter the defendants had sent her after she submitted her resignation. The letter stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I wish to clarify that the undertakings being carried out by this municipality with respect to personnel transactions are due to the findings made by the Comptroller of Puerto Rico in his audit report [] and the corrective action plan, which we are required to submit to said office, correcting the findings of irregularities in the proceedings involving appointment and selection of personnel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these statements by the court and the admission of this letter reflect a laudable attempt by the court to be fair to all parties, they were not enough to render the exclusions by the court inconsequential. The court's third statement and the letter to V&#225;zquez merely paraphrase the defendants' position at trial. They did nothing to show that the Commonwealth authorities had in fact given the legal opinions in question. The district court's summaries of the audit and one letter also failed to put the jury on notice of the contents of the excluded documents. First, the district court did not allow the jury to know that the audit report had contained the admonition that \"[f]ailure to heed a recommendation in an audit report from this Office, without just cause, may constitute a violation of [Puerto Rico law].\" Second, the court's summary of the letter to Delgado did not let the jury know that the Commonwealth had recommended \"reclassifying [the affected employees] into positions for which they meet the requirements in accordance with the 1991 plan,\" which is precisely the course the defendants claimed that they took in regard to V&#225;zquez. Indeed, the district court's summary of the letter did not even let the jury know that the Commonwealth had advised the defendants to reclassify employees at all. In short, the summaries by the court simply were insufficient to convey the seriousness with which the Commonwealth had insisted that the defendants remedy the previous administration's abuses, and the specific measures they urged the defendants to take. For these reasons, the exclusion of the documentary evidence was not harmless, and we must vacate the jury's verdict and remand for a new trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several times during the proceedings, the individual defendants asked the district court to rule that they were entitled to qualified immunity. They asked for summary judgment on that ground, a request that the district court denied because there were disputed issues of fact relating to the defendants' actual motivations for V&#225;zquez's demotion. The district court explained that the defendants would not be entitled to qualified immunity if the jury concluded that they had demoted V&#225;zquez because of political animus. In the court's view, such a finding would establish that an objectively reasonable municipal official would not have acted as the defendants did.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The defendants also sought to invoke qualified immunity at trial, asking the district court to rule in their favor on that issue after V&#225;zquez's case in chief and again at the close of the evidence. The district court reserved its decision pending the jury's findings on the defendants' motivations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, according to the verdict form, the jury found that V&#225;zquez's \"political affiliation was a substantial or a motivating factor in the decision to demote her from her position as Executive Director II.\" On the basis of this finding, the district court denied the defendants' motion for qualified immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> We have now concluded that the jury verdict must be vacated because of the exclusion of evidence that the jury was entitled to hear. Given the centrality of the jury verdict to the district court's denial of qualified immunity, the district court should reexamine the qualified immunity issue as well. Indeed, we note here, as we did in <i>V&#225;zquez I,</i> that the same district court judge who heard this case presided over a second political discrimination case from Toa Baja, involving the same defendants and a group of plaintiffs who brought claims similar to V&#225;zquez's. <i>See Lugo v. Toa Baja,</i> 329 F.Supp.2d 221 (D.P.R.2004). In <i>Lugo,</i> which reached trial after our decision in <i>G&#243;mez,</i> the district court appropriately allowed in evidence the same documents that it excluded in this case. Presumably in light of that evidence, the district court concluded that the defendants in <i>Lugo</i> (the same defendants as here) were entitled to qualified immunity. The documents that we discussed above clearly are relevant to the qualified immunity analysis and should be evaluated by the district court when it considers that issue again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Judgment vacated.

Rather, they tell us that we misapprehended the law when we entered the judgment now vacated, and that we must reconsider the case now remanded to us in light of the Supreme Court's opinion. <i>Id.</i> Sometimes, despite the intervening precedent, we will enter the same judgment because, after due consideration, we conclude that the new precedent does not require a different outcome. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

Under <i>Unitherm,</i> we cannot review the denial of a Rule 50(a) motion based on the sufficiency of the evidence when the party appealing the verdict failed to renew its sufficiency challenge in the district court pursuant to Rule 50(b). <i>See Unitherm,</i> 126 S.Ct. at 987 (\"[A] party's Rule 50(a) motion . . . cannot be appealed unless that motion is renewed pursuant to Rule 50(b).\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez is equally wrong in arguing that we must reinstate the jury's verdict. In our 2004 decision, we did not reach the merits of several of the defendants' arguments for a new trial because we focused instead on the sufficiency of the evidence. In fact, we noted that we had doubts about the district court's evidentiary rulings but we did \"not have to decide the issue.\" <i>V&#225;zquez I,</i> 385 F.3d at 25 n. 1. In light of the remand from the Supreme Court, we must now address the rulings that prompted those doubts. <i>See Gonzalez,</i> 420 F.3d at 8.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recited the facts at length in <i>V&#225;zquez I,</i> 385 F.3d at 23-29. We incorporate those facts by reference, summarizing only briefly the details most pertinent to our discussion here.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> V&#225;zquez claimed that she was demoted as a result of the defendants' animus against her political affiliation. The defendants, members of the municipal administration of Toa Baja that took charge in January 2001, claimed that she was demoted because the previous municipal administration had promoted her illegally and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico had mandated corrective action.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In support of this defense, the defendants invoked an audit of municipal personnel practices that the Comptroller of Puerto Rico had completed during the last months of the previous administration. <i>See V&#225;zquez I,</i> 385 F.3d at 25 n. 1. The audit revealed that Toa Baja had run afoul of numerous Commonwealth laws relating to the appointment and promotion of municipal employees. Under Puerto Rico law, \"all municipal jobs are governed by so-called job classification plans that are adopted locally. These plans set forth the occupational groups and personnel structure of the municipality, including the primary responsibilities and employment requirements for each position in city government.\" <i>V&#225;zquez I,</i> 385 F.3d at 26. These job classification plans generally must be approved by the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico before they can be implemented. Once a job classification plan has been approved, municipalities normally must use a merit system to fill the career positions the plan creates. <i>See Gonzalez-De-Blasini v. Family Dept.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201167\"><a href=\"/opinion/201167/gonzalez-de-blasini-v-family-department/\"><span class=\"volume\">377</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 86 (1st Cir.2004). \"Under this system, career employees must, among other requirements, pass a competitive examination to be eligible for appointment or promotion to a career position.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the Comptroller's audit report, Toa Baja had adhered neither to the requirement that it submit its job classification plans to the Commonwealth for approval, nor the requirement that it use a merit system to fill jobs and make promotions. The municipality's main structural violations were its use of an unapproved 1997 job classification plan (Toa Baja's most recent properly-approved plan dated from 1991) and its habit of ignoring the normal merit-based appointment system in favor of a system by which relatives and allies of the mayor routinely received desirable posts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Under Puerto Rico law, personnel appointments made in violation of Commonwealth laws and regulations normally \"are null and void <i>ab initio.</i>\" <i>Gonzalez-De-Blasini,</i> 377 F.3d at 86 (internal quotation marks omitted). Accordingly, the Comptroller's audit report \"recommended\" that the municipality take corrective action to undo any illegal personnel actions. The same report warned that \"[f]ailure to heed a recommendation in an audit report from this Office, without just cause, may constitute a violation of [Puerto Rico law].\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In reaction to the audit report, the outgoing municipal administration began reviewing personnel files and, according to a letter it sent to Commonwealth officials, \"encountered cases of employees that did not meet the requirements of their position.\" Commonwealth officials responded that these employees would \"need to be re-routed to a classification for which they meet the requirements.\" Before any reclassifications took place, the November 2000 election happened, and the previous administration &#8212; the one responsible for the violations cited by the audit report &#8212; was replaced by an administration headed by the defendant mayor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon taking office, the defendants made several inquiries to Commonwealth officials about the audit report and its recommendations. In particular, the defendants asked whether all employee appointments pursuant to the municipality's 1997 personnel plan, which had not been properly approved, would have to be rescinded. The Commonwealth's answer was that \"the 1997 plans have no validity\" so \"we recommend [] the alternative of reclassifing [the affected employees] into positions for which they meet the requirements in accordance with the 1991 plan.\" In light of this guidance, the new administration adopted a corrective action plan that called for a thorough review of personnel files and reassignment of any improperly-promoted employees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The resulting reviews and reclassifications had a large effect on municipal employees. As we noted in <i>V&#225;zquez I,</i> by the time of the trial, \"around six hundred files had been evaluated.\" 385 F.3d at 26. This number represented slightly less than half of the municipality's workforce. Of those employees whose files had been evaluated, roughly half \"had sought an informal hearing regarding the personnel action that resulted from the review.\" <i>Id.</i> V&#225;zquez was one of the many employees who was reclassified as a result of the new administration's review and who sought a hearing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez started working for Toa Baja while a college student in 1985, as a \"transitory\" office clerk. She was appointed to the career position of \"Office Worker / Typist I\" in 1989. She held that post until the summer of 1993, when she was elevated to \"Secretary III.\" Less than two months later, she was promoted again to \"Assistant Director.\" The post \"Assistant Director\" was later renamed \"Executive Director II,\" the position V&#225;zquez held when the new administration took office. <i>See V&#225;zquez I,</i> 385 F.3d at 28. When the defendants reviewed V&#225;zquez's personnel records, they decided that both of her 1993 promotions had been in violation of the 1991 plan. Specifically, the defendants later explained to V&#225;zquez that her promotion from \"Office Worker / Typist I\" to \"Secretary III\" had been improper because she had not had the required courses in business skills or typing, and because she had not spent the required year as a \"Secretary II\" or equivalent. Her second promotion, they said, was improper for want of the required experience and because it had occurred so soon after the previous promotion. In the spring of 2001, the defendants informed V&#225;zquez that the illegality of her 1993 promotions meant that she would have to be demoted to the position of \"Office Worker / Typist I,\" the same post that she had assumed in 1989. That job had no supervisory responsibilities and paid less than half as much as her \"Executive Director II\" position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">V&#225;zquez protested that she was a college graduate with many years of experience in municipal government, and that her college transcript clearly showed that she had taken typewriting and shorthand courses. (Apparently, the transcript was not in her personnel file.) When she learned that she would be demoted despite her educational credentials and experience, V&#225;zquez asked for and was granted a hearing before an administrative hearing officer. V&#225;zquez later testified that the hearing lasted about five minutes. The hearing officer determined in a written decision that V&#225;zquez had been hired and promoted illegally. Shortly after her demotion became effective, V&#225;zquez resigned her new position. Suspecting that the true reason for her demotion was her political affiliation with the party that had lost the 2000 election, she timely filed this case alleging political discrimination.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the trial in April and May 2002, to demonstrate that they had acted in good faith in demoting V&#225;zquez, the defendants sought to introduce as evidence the Comptroller's audit and the communications between the municipal administration and Commonwealth officials that followed. The defendants made these efforts during the testimony of their two principal witnesses, defendant Milagros Delgado-Ortiz (Delgado), who was the new administration's human resources director, and the defendant mayor, Victor Santiago-D&#237;az (D&#237;az). During Delgado's testimony, the defendants attempted to introduce the audit report itself and a four-page letter to her from the Commonwealth Office of Municipal Affairs explaining that the 1997 personnel plan was invalid. The defendants also attempted to have Delgado testify as to the contents of these documents. During D&#237;az's testimony, the defendants attempted to introduce a letter D&#237;az sent to Commonwealth officials asking what the municipality should do in light of the earlier documents, and two letters from the Commonwealth in response, giving the advice that the municipality should reclassify its employees. Alternatively, the defendants sought to have D&#237;az testify about these letters.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court excluded all of this proffered evidence on two grounds. The district court cited the hearsay rule and also noted generally that it did not want to expose the jury to the legal conclusions in the documents. Referring specifically to the letter from the Commonwealth officials to Delgado, the district court stated that the document \"is a conclusion of law and is hearsay [and] for this reason [] cannot be admitted as evidence.\" The district court also expressed concern that the audit report could be unfairly prejudicial to V&#225;zquez because it contained many statements that did not pertain to her appointment specifically. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403. On appeal, V&#225;zquez echoes these rationales, which are unpersuasive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the defendants point out, the excluded documents were not hearsay because they were not \"offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.\" Fed.R.Evid. 801(c); <i>see also Ram&#237;rez-Rodriguez v. Boehringer Ingelheim Pharmaceuticals, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201844\"><a href=\"/opinion/201844/ramirez-rodriguez-v-boehringer/\"><span class=\"volume\">425</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span>, 76-77 (1st Cir.2005). We indicated as much in <i>V&#225;zquez I:</i> \"The exclusion of these documents as hearsay is troubling. So crucial to the defendants' case, and offered as an explanation for the personnel actions undertaken by the defendants rather than for the truth of the personnel irregularities described in the documents, these documents are not hearsay, and they were highly relevant. Their exclusion might well have justified a new trial.\" 385 F.3d at 25 n. 1. The \"matters asserted\" in the documents were that many Toa Baja employees had been hired without due regard for procedures, that the Mayor and his administration would be liable under the Commonwealth's ethics laws if they did not take measures to remedy the hiring abuses of the previous administration, and that the approach of reviewing personnel files and reclassifying employees was consistent with the Commonwealth's guidance. The defendants \"offer[ed] these assertions to explain the basis for [their] decision to [demote V&#225;zquez].\" <i>Ram&#237;rez Rodriguez,</i> 425 F.3d at 77. The issue at trial was not whether V&#225;zquez was appointed properly or whether the new administration was legally liable for the abuses of its predecessors. Rather, the issue for the jury was whether the defendants had demoted V&#225;zquez as a result of her political affiliation, or for some other reason. \"In short, the documents were not offered to prove\" that the new administration was legally obligated to demote V&#225;zquez, \"but rather to demonstrate that h[er] superiors had reason, based on a thorough investigation, to believe that [they were required to demote her].\" <i>Id.</i> Accordingly, the documents were not hearsay.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The suggestion that the documents were inadmissible legal opinions fails for similar reasons. The documents did contain legal conclusions about the propriety of the previous municipal administration's personnel decisions. But this is not a case about the propriety of V&#225;zquez's appointment.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> The critical issue in this case-the ultimate issue for the jury &#8212; was determining the defendants' motivations for demoting V&#225;zquez. The documents offered no legal conclusions about those motivations. Rather, they described a neutral evaluation of the municipality's personnel policies that, if truly relied upon, provided a non-discriminatory basis for V&#225;zquez's demotion. As we explained in a case involving a similar situation, while the documents were \"not admissible for the purpose of proving what obligations the law imposed upon the Mayor, [they were] admissible to show the Mayor's understanding at the time and his ensuing state of mind.\" <i>G&#243;mez v. Rivera Rodr&#237;guez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200650\"><a href=\"/opinion/200650/gomez-candelaria-v-rivera-rodriguez/\"><span class=\"volume\">344</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">103</span></a></span>, 115 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>G&#243;mez</i> also refutes V&#225;zquez's suggestion that the documents could have been excluded, <i>in toto,</i> pursuant to Rule 403. In <i>G&#243;mez</i> we noted that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Rule 403 balancing test applies statement by statement. See <i>Kassel v. Gannett Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"524049\"><a href=\"/opinion/524049/jeffrey-kassel-v-gannett-co-inc-dba-usa-today/\"><span class=\"volume\">875</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">935</span></a></span>, 952 (1st Cir.1989) (noting that the trial court \"must balance the prejudicial effect and probative value of each statement offered\"). To use the rule as an instrument for the wholesale exclusion of a percipient witness's testimony would be tantamount to allowing the presider to cut down the entire tree out of fear that some of the fruit might prove rotten. Rule 403 requires more delicate pruning of evidentiary proffers. <i>See id.</i> (warning against throwing \"out the baby with the bath water\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> at 115 (footnote omitted); <i>see also id.</i> at 115 n. 7 (\"[T]he need to limit the jury's use of certain testimony does not give the trial court carte blanche to exclude it entirely.\"). Here, there would be a similar calculus. If, as the district court suggested, there was some material in the audit report that was unfairly prejudicial to V&#225;zquez, the remedy should have been to redact the offending statements from the jury's view, not to exclude the document entirely.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anticipating the possible rejection of her arguments, V&#225;zquez asserts that any error in excluding the documents was not prejudicial to the defendants given other material that was admitted in evidence. She points particularly to the statements that the district court read to the jury summarizing some of the excluded material. After refusing to let Delgado testify as to the contents of the audit report, the district court told the jury that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Comptroller of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico performed an audit in which his staff examined a sample of personnel files. The report stated that certain irregularities in the placement of some employees for the Municipality of Toa Baja had been found. The report should not be taken as evidence of the truth or veracity of the statement found therein, but rather only that the report was made.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In regard to the letter to Delgado about the illegality of the 1997 personnel plan, the district court told the jury that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mrs. Delgado sought advice from [the Commonwealth]. Mrs Delgado received a letter in reply to this petition for advice. The letter received by Mrs. Delgado is evidence only that she sought and received advice. The letter in no way proves that the advice she received was true or legal.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court also told the jury, as part of its charge, that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">. . . according to the defendant, plaintiff's demotion was based on legitimate policy and administrative consideration devoid of any political motivation. They contend that their demotion was a direct result of the implementation of a plan to reorganize the working positions within the municipality. Defendants further claim that the Comptroller of Puerto Rico concluded that the municipality's previous administration had illegally appointed many employees and had illegally raised the compensation of others.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, V&#225;zquez points out that during cross-examination of her own testimony, the defendants persuaded the district court that V&#225;zquez should read to the jury a letter the defendants had sent her after she submitted her resignation. The letter stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I wish to clarify that the undertakings being carried out by this municipality with respect to personnel transactions are due to the findings made by the Comptroller of Puerto Rico in his audit report [] and the corrective action plan, which we are required to submit to said office, correcting the findings of irregularities in the proceedings involving appointment and selection of personnel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although these statements by the court and the admission of this letter reflect a laudable attempt by the court to be fair to all parties, they were not enough to render the exclusions by the court inconsequential. The court's third statement and the letter to V&#225;zquez merely paraphrase the defendants' position at trial. They did nothing to show that the Commonwealth authorities had in fact given the legal opinions in question. The district court's summaries of the audit and one letter also failed to put the jury on notice of the contents of the excluded documents. First, the district court did not allow the jury to know that the audit report had contained the admonition that \"[f]ailure to heed a recommendation in an audit report from this Office, without just cause, may constitute a violation of [Puerto Rico law].\" Second, the court's summary of the letter to Delgado did not let the jury know that the Commonwealth had recommended \"reclassifying [the affected employees] into positions for which they meet the requirements in accordance with the 1991 plan,\" which is precisely the course the defendants claimed that they took in regard to V&#225;zquez. Indeed, the district court's summary of the letter did not even let the jury know that the Commonwealth had advised the defendants to reclassify employees at all. In short, the summaries by the court simply were insufficient to convey the seriousness with which the Commonwealth had insisted that the defendants remedy the previous administration's abuses, and the specific measures they urged the defendants to take. For these reasons, the exclusion of the documentary evidence was not harmless, and we must vacate the jury's verdict and remand for a new trial.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Several times during the proceedings, the individual defendants asked the district court to rule that they were entitled to qualified immunity. They asked for summary judgment on that ground, a request that the district court denied because there were disputed issues of fact relating to the defendants' actual motivations for V&#225;zquez's demotion. The district court explained that the defendants would not be entitled to qualified immunity if the jury concluded that they had demoted V&#225;zquez because of political animus. In the court's view, such a finding would establish that an objectively reasonable municipal official would not have acted as the defendants did.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The defendants also sought to invoke qualified immunity at trial, asking the district court to rule in their favor on that issue after V&#225;zquez's case in chief and again at the close of the evidence. The district court reserved its decision pending the jury's findings on the defendants' motivations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the end, according to the verdict form, the jury found that V&#225;zquez's \"political affiliation was a substantial or a motivating factor in the decision to demote her from her position as Executive Director II.\" On the basis of this finding, the district court denied the defendants' motion for qualified immunity.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> We have now concluded that the jury verdict must be vacated because of the exclusion of evidence that the jury was entitled to hear. Given the centrality of the jury verdict to the district court's denial of qualified immunity, the district court should reexamine the qualified immunity issue as well. Indeed, we note here, as we did in <i>V&#225;zquez I,</i> that the same district court judge who heard this case presided over a second political discrimination case from Toa Baja, involving the same defendants and a group of plaintiffs who brought claims similar to V&#225;zquez's. <i>See Lugo v. Toa Baja,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2409785\"><a href=\"/opinion/2409785/aldarondo-lugo-v-municipality-of-toa-baja/\"><span class=\"volume\">329</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">221</span></a></span> (D.P.R.2004). In <i>Lugo,</i> which reached trial after our decision in <i>G&#243;mez,</i> the district court appropriately allowed in evidence the same documents that it excluded in this case. Presumably in light of that evidence, the district court concluded that the defendants in <i>Lugo</i> (the same defendants as here) were entitled to qualified immunity. The documents that we discussed above clearly are relevant to the qualified immunity analysis and should be evaluated by the district court when it considers that issue again.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Judgment vacated.
