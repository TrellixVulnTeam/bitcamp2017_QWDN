Aida M. Delgado-Colón, U. S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                 Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n              Torruella and Boudin, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n\n     Raymond L. Sanchez-Maceira on brief for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sosa, Assistant U.S. Attorney, Luke Cass,\nAssistant U.S. Attorney, and Rosa Emilia Rodriguez-Velez, United\nStates Attorney, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                             March 6, 2009\n\f             Per Curiam. Defendant Danny Rebollo-Andino, charged with\n\nbeing a participant in a multi-defendant drug conspiracy, appeals\n\nfrom    a   district    court    order   denying      pretrial    bail.      Having\n\nconducted an independent review tempered by deference to the\n\ndistrict court's findings, see, e.g., United States v. O'Brien, 895\n\nF.2d 810, 812 (1st Cir. 1990), we affirm.             Defendant has not sought\n\nto rebut the presumption of flight and dangerousness that apply in\n\nthis context.      He instead makes oblique reference to one or more\n\nmedical ailments that, on the present record at least, fall well\n\nshort of calling the detention order into question.\n\n             A   superseding      indictment      charges     defendant     and   58\n\ncodefendants with operating a drug trafficking organization in La\n\nTrocha Ward of Vega Baja, Puerto Rico.                    More specifically, all\n\ndefendants are charged with conspiracy and substantive violations\n\ninvolving possession with intent to distribute 50 grams or more of\n\ncrack cocaine and 100 kilograms or more of marijuana within 100\n\nfeet of a public youth facility.           See 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846,\n\n860.    Defendant allegedly served as a \"runner,\" supplying drugs to\n\nthe    sellers    and   collecting   the       proceeds    for   delivery   to    the\n\nleaders.     According to the indictment, the runners also supervised\n\ndaily activities at the drug distribution points and, together with\n\nthe    leaders,     \"would      discipline      the   other      members    of    the\n\norganization by the use of force, violence and/or intimidation.\"\n\n\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\f           At    a    December   2,    2008    detention    hearing,      defendant\n\noffered no argument regarding bail but reserved the right to\n\nrevisit the issue.            The magistrate judge issued an order of\n\ndetention that same day, finding by clear and convincing evidence\n\nthat no conditions of release would reasonably secure defendant's\n\nappearance or the community's safety.                 On December 11, 2008,\n\ndefendant filed a motion for \"de novo bail hearing\" under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3145(b).     He there requested \"home incarceration,\" stating that\n\nhe \"suffers from various medical conditions that warrant surgery\n\n[and] that will require treatment and hospitalization that will not\n\nbe otherwise available\" at the detention facility.                  Defendant did\n\nnot   identify       his   medical       ailments,    did    not     provide   any\n\ndocumentation thereof, did not explain why he would be unable to\n\nreceive adequate treatment while in detention, and did not discuss\n\nhow the requested \"home incarceration\" would operate. The district\n\ncourt summarily denied the motion on January 21, 2009, noting that\n\n\"no   facts\"    had    been    alleged    warranting    a   de     novo    hearing.\n\nDefendant now appeals from this ruling.\n\n           The determination that defendant poses a risk of both\n\nflight and danger has not been challenged on appeal and appears\n\notherwise unexceptionable.            We simply note the following.            The\n\nindictment     provides     probable     cause   to   believe      that   defendant\n\ncommitted a drug offense carrying a maximum term of imprisonment of\n\nten years or more.         See, e.g., United States v. Dillon, 938 F.2d\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\f1412,    1416   (1st   Cir.   1991)   (per   curiam).   Consequently,   the\n\nrebuttable presumption in favor of detention applies.              See 18\n\nU.S.C. § 3142(e) (\"[s]ubject to rebuttal by the person, it shall be\n\npresumed that no condition or combination of conditions will\n\nreasonably assure the appearance of the person as required and the\n\nsafety of the community\").            Defendant has failed to satisfy his\n\nburden of production by presenting \"some evidence\" to rebut this\n\npresumption.     United States v. Jessup, 757 F.2d 378, 384 (1st Cir.\n\n1985).    And even if he had done so, the presumption would still\n\ncarry significant weight here, since defendant's case appears to\n\nresemble the \"congressional paradigm,\" United States v. Palmer-\n\nContreras, 835 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1987) (per curiam), involving\n\nthe special risks of flight and danger posed by organized drug\n\ntraffickers\n\n            With respect to the motion for de novo hearing, the\n\ndistrict court can hardly be faulted for declining to overturn the\n\nbail decision based on defendant's allegation that he has one or\n\nmore unidentified \"medical conditions.\"          Nor, without some further\n\nexplanation of the underlying circumstances, was the court required\n\nto convene an evidentiary hearing.              We note that defendant's\n\nappellate brief likewise contains no description of his ailments;\n\nonly in his notice of appeal, curiously enough, has he disclosed\n\nthat he suffers from an abdominal hernia (and that his daughter\n\nsuffers from lymphoma).         And even there, he does not explain why\n\n\n                                       -4-\n\fhis detention would prevent him from obtaining adequate treatment\n\nfor his hernia condition (and proper care for his daughter).\n\n            Should future developments so warrant, defendant retains\n\nthe ability to request reopening of the detention issue under §\n\n3142(f) or, in extraordinary circumstances, even temporary release\n\nunder § 3142(i).        On the present record, however, no error is\n\napparent.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\f",
