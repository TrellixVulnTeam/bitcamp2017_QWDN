The School\n\nmoved       to    dismiss      on        numerous      grounds       including         the    three-\n\nyear statute of limitations for actions in fraud, Mass. Gen.\n\nLaws ch. 260, § 2A.\n\n       The       latter      ground,        under      any    view        of    the    record      (and\n\nwithout          any    guidance          from     the      district           court),      warrants\n\ndismissal under Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6).                                        That is, under\n\nthe     relevant          Massachusetts               statute        of    limitations,            Mr.\n\nJolicoeur          had        three        years       to    file         his     lawsuit,         the\n\noverriding theme of which was fraud. Hendrickson v. Sears,\n\n310    N.E.       2d   131,        132    (Mass.      1974);     Mass.          Gen.

Even        drawing          the     facts    and     their        reasonable\n\ninferences         in     Mr.    Jolicoeur’s         favor    and        substituting      Mr.\n\nJolicoeur’s         graduation          date,       June    10,    2000,    for    the     last\n\npossible       time        when       the    ABA’s     November          1999     denial     of\n\naccreditation            to     the    School       caused    him        injury,    we     must\n\nconclude the complaint was untimely.\n\n       In his reply brief, Mr. Jolicoeur stated his “cause of\n\naction      did      not       even     accrue       until        June,    2000     when     he\n\ngraduated          from       the     unaccredited          school.”            Further,    he\n\ncontended each false promise constituted “a separate harm\n\nfor which          the    statute       of limitations began anew.”                      Under\n\neither theory, the date of accrual of Mr. Jolicoeur’s rights\n\nis    either       November         2002,    or     June    10,    2003.         Surely,    the\n\n“storm      warnings”           were    visible       on    both     dates.        Young     v.\n\nLepone, 305 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 2002).                             Mr. Jolicoeur filed\n\nhis    complaint          on     June       18,   2003,      eight        days    after     the\n\nlimitary period had run.                     The complaint is, thus, barred by\n\nthe statute of limitations.\n\n       Nonetheless, despite the apparent lack of merit in this\n\nappeal, we find it necessary to remind the district court of\n\nits    critical          responsibility.              As    part     of    the     appellate\n\nprocess,       a    trial        court       must    insure        the     basis    for     its\n\nresolution of a matter subject to appeal is clear.                                         Even\n\nwhen a court finds arguments of counsel persuasive, as the\n\n\n                                              -4-\n\fdistrict court apparently did in this case, it must keep the\n\nappellate record in mind.                Because it is the basis for any\n\nappeal, the district court’s disposition informs the review.\n\nIt is vital, therefore, that an appellate court be provided\n\nwith the district judge’s thoughts rather than be left to\n\nrummage about in papers filed by counsel in an attempt to\n\ndeduce the trial court’s reasoning.                 Moreover, the appellate\n\ncourt    must    also     have     assurance    that       a    district       court’s\n\ndecisions will not be subjected to hindsight revision by a\n\nzealous advocate who is free to write upon a blank page.\n\nThis assurance comes about when the trial court explains its\n\nreasoning.\n\n    Finally, it is only by happenstance that this record\n\npermits    one    resolution;         otherwise,      we   would        have   had   to\n\nremand    the    matter      to   the    district     court      to     complete     its\n\ntask.     Although      we    fully      appreciate    the      burdens and        time\n\nconstraints       imposed         upon    our   trial          courts     that     make\n\nexpeditious results attractive, we cannot help but observe\n\nthat a few moments spent at the district court level often\n\ncan forestall the expenditure of much more time bringing the\n\nappellate process to a full and proper conclusion.\n\n    We affirm the dismissal of the complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f",

Even        drawing          the     facts    and     their        reasonable\n\ninferences         in     Mr.    Jolicoeur’s         favor    and        substituting      Mr.\n\nJolicoeur’s         graduation          date,       June    10,    2000,    for    the     last\n\npossible       time        when       the    ABA’s     November          1999     denial     of\n\naccreditation            to     the    School       caused    him        injury,    we     must\n\nconclude the complaint was untimely.\n\n       In his reply brief, Mr. Jolicoeur stated his “cause of\n\naction      did      not       even     accrue       until        June,    2000     when     he\n\ngraduated          from       the     unaccredited          school.”            Further,    he\n\ncontended each false promise constituted “a separate harm\n\nfor which          the    statute       of limitations began anew.”                      Under\n\neither theory, the date of accrual of Mr. Jolicoeur’s rights\n\nis    either       November         2002,    or     June    10,    2003.         Surely,    the\n\n“storm      warnings”           were    visible       on    both     dates.        Young     v.\n\nLepone, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200124\"><a href=\"/opinion/200124/cape-ann-investors-v-lepone/\"><span class=\"volume\">305</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 9 (1st Cir. 2002).                             Mr. Jolicoeur filed\n\nhis    complaint          on     June       18,   2003,      eight        days    after     the\n\nlimitary period had run.                     The complaint is, thus, barred by\n\nthe statute of limitations.\n\n       Nonetheless, despite the apparent lack of merit in this\n\nappeal, we find it necessary to remind the district court of\n\nits    critical          responsibility.              As    part     of    the     appellate\n\nprocess,       a    trial        court       must    insure        the     basis    for     its\n\nresolution of a matter subject to appeal is clear.                                         Even\n\nwhen a court finds arguments of counsel persuasive, as the\n\n\n                                              -4-\n\fdistrict court apparently did in this case, it must keep the\n\nappellate record in mind.                Because it is the basis for any\n\nappeal, the district court’s disposition informs the review.\n\nIt is vital, therefore, that an appellate court be provided\n\nwith the district judge’s thoughts rather than be left to\n\nrummage about in papers filed by counsel in an attempt to\n\ndeduce the trial court’s reasoning.                 Moreover, the appellate\n\ncourt    must    also     have     assurance    that       a    district       court’s\n\ndecisions will not be subjected to hindsight revision by a\n\nzealous advocate who is free to write upon a blank page.\n\nThis assurance comes about when the trial court explains its\n\nreasoning.\n\n    Finally, it is only by happenstance that this record\n\npermits    one    resolution;         otherwise,      we   would        have   had   to\n\nremand    the    matter      to   the    district     court      to     complete     its\n\ntask.     Although      we    fully      appreciate    the      burdens and        time\n\nconstraints       imposed         upon    our   trial          courts     that     make\n\nexpeditious results attractive, we cannot help but observe\n\nthat a few moments spent at the district court level often\n\ncan forestall the expenditure of much more time bringing the\n\nappellate process to a full and proper conclusion.\n\n    We affirm the dismissal of the complaint.\n\n\n\n\n                                          -5-\n\f</pre>",
