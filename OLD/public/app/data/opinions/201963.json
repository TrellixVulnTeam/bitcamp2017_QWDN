In this appeal pursuant to Rule\n\n23(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure from an order\n\ncertifying a class in a securities fraud case, we must decide an\n\nissue of first impression in this Circuit:            the standard for\n\ndetermining whether a market was \"efficient\" when applying the\n\nfraud-on-the-market presumption of investor reliance.            We also\n\naddress the level of inquiry that a district court may pursue at\n\nthe    class-certification   stage   when   making    that     efficiency\n\ndetermination.     Defendants-Appellants     PolyMedica      Corporation,\n\nLiberty Medical Supply, Inc. (\"Liberty\"), and various officers of\n\nboth   companies   (collectively,    \"PolyMedica\"1)   argue    that   the\n\ndistrict court erred in finding that common questions predominated\n\nunder Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, by\n\ndetermining that the market was efficient for eight months of the\n\nclass period, from January 2001 through August 2001 (the \"Contested\n\nTime Period\"), and deeming PolyMedica's expert evidence irrelevant\n\nto that determination.   For the reasons set forth below, we vacate\n\nthe district court's order certifying the class for the Contested\n\nTime Period, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  For the sake of simplicity, we refer to both Defendants-\nAppellants who bring this appeal, together with the company whose\nstock is at issue in this case, PolyMedica Corporation, as\n\"PolyMedica.\"\n\n                                 -3-\n\f                                        I.\n\n           Thomas Thuma (\"Plaintiff\") is a purchaser of PolyMedica\n\nstock,   who   seeks    to   represent    a   class    of    all    purchasers   of\n\nPolyMedica     stock    from    October       1998    through       August    2001.2\n\nPolyMedica is the parent company of Liberty, a seller of diabetic\n\ntesting supplies.        According to Plaintiff, PolyMedica reported\n\nrecord   revenues      and   earnings    during      the    class    period   based\n\nprimarily on the growth of Liberty's diabetic supplies business,\n\nwhich accounted for up to 80% of PolyMedica's revenues.                        As a\n\nresult of these increases in revenue and earnings, the price of\n\nPolyMedica's stock, which traded on the NASDAQ3 and the American\n\nStock Exchange during the class period, increased substantially.\n\n\n\n2\n  This is a consolidated action. On November 27, 2000, Richard\nBowe, SEP-IRA, filed a federal securities class action against\nPolyMedica Corporation and its Chief Executive Officer, Steven J.\nLee. A like action was subsequently filed by Trust Advisors Equity\nPlus LLC on December 19, 2000. The district court consolidated the\ntwo cases on July 30, 2001, and allowed a motion appointing Bowe,\nJohn T. Muha, and Thomas Thuma as lead plaintiffs and approving\ntheir selection of lead counsel. On October 9, 2001, the three\nlead plaintiffs, together with three other plaintiffs, Lawrence\nStorey, Jianwei Xu, and Howard Hoffman, filed a consolidated\ncomplaint. The district court subsequently allowed Bowe and Muha\nto withdraw, leaving Thomas Thuma as lead plaintiff. For the sake\nof simplicity, we treat all the plaintiffs' filings as being made\nby Thuma.\n3\n  \"NASDAQ\" stands for the National Association of Securities\nDealers Automated Quotation, \"the largest electronic, screen-based\nmarket in the world. . . . [whose] services enable securities firms\nto execute transactions in The Nasdaq Stock Market from their own\nlocations, relying on real-time trade reporting and automated\nmarket surveillance.\"    Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. v. Archipelago\nHoldings, LLC, 336 F. Supp. 2d 294, 297 (S.D.N.Y. 2004).\n\n                                        -4-\n\fIn the consolidated complaint, filed on October 9, 2001, Plaintiff\n\nalleges that PolyMedica artificially inflated the market price of\n\nits   stock     by    misrepresenting    sales,    revenues,   and    accounts\n\nreceivable, and by issuing false press releases, causing Plaintiff\n\nand other members of the class to purchase stock at artificially\n\ninflated prices.        Plaintiff further alleges that when the truth of\n\nthis fraud became known, PolyMedica's stock lost more than 80% of\n\nits value.         Plaintiff seeks damages under Section 10(b) of the\n\nSecurities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b) (the \"Exchange\n\nAct\") and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5,\n\nand Section 20(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78t(a).\n\n              On     January   28,   2004,    following   several    years   of\n\nlitigation, Plaintiff moved for class certification pursuant to\n\nFed. R. Civ. P. 23(a)4 and (b)(3)5, asserting that common questions\n\nof law and fact predominated, based on the \"fraud-on-the-market\"\n\ntheory.   As we explain in greater detail below, under the Supreme\n\n\n\n4\n  PolyMedica does not dispute that the requirements of Rule 23(a)\n– numerosity, typicality, commonality, and adequacy – have been\nmet. Therefore, we do not address them here.\n5\n  Rule 23(b)(3) provides, in relevant part, that \"[a]n action may\nbe maintained as a class action if . . . the court finds that the\nquestions of law or fact common to the members of the class\npredominate over any questions affecting only individual members.\"\nThis requirement, \"although reminiscent of the commonality\nrequirement of Rule 23(a), is 'far more demanding' because it\n'tests whether proposed classes are sufficiently cohesive to\nwarrant adjudication by representation.'\" Unger v. Amedisys Inc.,\n401 F.3d 316, 320 (5th Cir. 2005) (quoting Amchem Prods., Inc. v.\nWindsor, 521 U.S. 591, 623-24 (1997)).\n\n                                        -5-\n\fCourt's plurality decision in Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S. 224\n\n(1988),6   this   theory    obviates   the    need   for    a   plaintiff   to\n\ndemonstrate individualized reliance on a defendant's misstatement\n\nby permitting a class-wide rebuttable presumption of reliance,\n\nthereby enabling a securities fraud class action to meet Rule\n\n23(b)(3)'s commonality requirement. PolyMedica opposed the motion,\n\narguing that the fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance was\n\ninapplicable for the Contested Time Period7 because the market for\n\nPolyMedica   stock    was    not   \"efficient\"       (a    prerequisite     for\n\napplication of the presumption).             Both sides submitted expert\n\ntestimony in support of their respective positions.\n\n           Plaintiff's expert, Alan R. Miller, relying upon each of\n\nthe five widely-accepted market-efficiency factors set forth in\n\nCammer v. Bloom, 711 F. Supp. 1264 (D.N.J. 1989), concluded that\n\nthe market for PolyMedica stock was efficient.                  PolyMedica's\n\nexpert, Dr. Denise Neumann Martin, in turn, concluded that the\n\nPolymedica market was not efficient, based on three factors not\n\nenumerated in Cammer.       A hearing on Plaintiff's motion for class\n\n\n\n6\n   Justice Blackmun delivered the opinion of the Court in Basic,\njoined by Justices Brennan, Marshall, and Stevens. Justice White,\njoined by Justice O'Connor, dissented from the portion of the\nCourt's holding applying the fraud-on-the-market presumption of\nreliance. Justices Rehnquist, Scalia, and Kennedy took no part in\nthe consideration or decision of the case.\n7\n   PolyMedica does not dispute that the fraud-on-the-market\npresumption of reliance applies to the first two years of the class\nperiod, October 1998 through December 2000.\n\n                                   -6-\n\fcertification was held on July 16, 2004.    On September 7, 2004, the\n\ndistrict court granted Plaintiff's motion to certify the class for\n\nthe entire proposed class period, rejecting Dr. Martin's evidence\n\nas not relevant to the definition of \"market efficiency,\" which the\n\ncourt derived from Basic.   The court also excluded from the class\n\nthose investors who participated in short-sale transactions (i.e.,\n\ntransactions involving the sale of a borrowed security, as further\n\ndiscussed below), leaving it to \"able counsel [to] develop an\n\nefficient solution\" for identifying short-sellers.\n\n          PolyMedica   filed   an    interlocutory   appeal   from   the\n\ndistrict court's order certifying the class pursuant to Rule 23(f),\n\nwhich we permitted on February 15, 2005.8      On appeal, PolyMedica\n\nargues that the district court erred in determining that the market\n\nfor PolyMedica stock was \"efficient\" during the Contested Time\n\nPeriod, and in concluding that the fraud-on-the-market presumption\n\nof reliance was therefore applicable for these months.        PolyMedica\n\nfurther argues that the district court erred in certifying the\n\nclass without a plan for identifying and excluding short-sellers\n\nfrom the class.\n\n\n\n\n8\n  Rule 23(f) provides, in relevant part, that \"a court of appeals\nmay in its discretion permit an appeal from an order of a district\ncourt granting or denying class action certification under this\nrule if application is made to it within ten days after entry of\nthe order.\" Fed. R. Civ. P. 23(f).\n\n                                    -7-\n\f                                          II.\n\nA.            Standard of Review\n\n              We generally review decisions granting or denying class\n\ncertification under the highly deferential \"abuse of discretion\"\n\nstandard.     Smilow v. Southwestern Bell Mobile Sys., Inc., 323 F.3d\n\n32, 37 (1st Cir. 2003).               Since Rule 23 contains express legal\n\nstandards      for     class     certification,    \"an   appeal     of   a     class\n\ncertification can pose pure issues of law which are reviewed de\n\nnovo,\" that is, without deference to the district court.                     Tardiff\n\nv. Knox County, 365 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2004).                  \"An error of law\n\nis, of course, always an abuse of discretion.\"                 Charlesbank Equity\n\nFund II v. Blinds To Go, Inc., 370 F.3d 151, 158 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\nMixed questions of law and fact fall along a degree-of-deference\n\ncontinuum,      ranging        from   non-deferential    plenary     review      for\n\nlaw-dominated questions, to deferential clear-error review for\n\nfact-dominated questions.             Johnson v. Watts Regulator Co., 63 F.3d\n\n1129, 1132 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n              The formulation of the proper standard for efficiency is\n\na    purely    legal    question       reviewed   de   novo.      Reviewing      the\n\napplication of that standard to the facts of a case involves the\n\nreview of a mixed question of law and fact.                See Cammer, 711 F.\n\nSupp. at 1277 (stating that \"[t]he question of whether the fraud-\n\non-the-market theory can substitute for direct reliance in any\n\ngiven case is both a legal and a factual one:                   is the market in\n\n                                          -8-\n\fwhich a particular company's stock trades efficient\").9              Given the\n\nvarious factors relevant to an efficiency determination, and the\n\nabundant evidence that can be developed with respect to each\n\nfactor, the determination of whether a market is efficient is a\n\nfact-dominated inquiry.     Therefore, deferential clear-error review\n\napplies to that determination.          The ultimate decision to certify a\n\nclass is, of course, a discretionary one.\n\nB.          Level of Inquiry by the District Court\n\n            In determining whether to certify the class, the district\n\ncourt   went   well   beyond     the    four   corners   of   the   pleadings,\n\nconsidering both parties' expert reports and literally hundreds of\n\npages of exhibits focused on market efficiency.                Before we can\n\ndecide whether the district court correctly certified Plaintiff's\n\nclass based on a finding of market efficiency, we must determine\n\nwhether this detailed level of inquiry was appropriate at the\n\nclass-certification     stage.         Plaintiff,   relying   on    the   Second\n\nCircuit's   decision   in   In    re    Visa   Check/MasterMoney     Antitrust\n\n\n\n9\n We recognize that several courts, including the district court in\nthis case, have characterized the determination of whether a\nparticular market is efficient as a question of fact. See, e.g.,\nIn re PolyMedica Corp. Sec. Litig., 224 F.R.D. 27, 42 (D. Mass.\n2004) (citing In re Laser Arms Corp. Sec. Litig., 794 F. Supp. 475,\n490 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (stating that \"[w]hether in fact [defendant\ncompany] traded in an efficient market is a question of fact\")).\nBecause this determination involves the application of the\ndefinition of efficiency to a particular market, however, we think\nit is more accurate to characterize this determination as a mixed\nquestion of law and fact.\n\n                                       -9-\n\fLitigation, 280 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2001), argues that a district\n\ncourt should not engage in a weighing of competing evidence at the\n\nclass-certification stage, and should instead confine its review to\n\nthe allegations raised in the plaintiff's complaint.               At that\n\nstage, according to the Second Circuit, \"a district court may not\n\nweigh    conflicting   expert   evidence   or   engage   in   'statistical\n\ndueling' of experts.\"     Id. at 135 (quoting Caridad v. Metro-North\n\nCommuter R.R., 191 F.3d 283, 292-93 (2d Cir. 1999)).          In support of\n\nits position, the Second Circuit looked to Eisen v. Carlisle &\n\nJacquelin, 417 U.S. 156 (1974), in which the Supreme Court held\n\nthat Rule 23 did not authorize courts \"to conduct a preliminary\n\ninquiry into the merits of a suit in order to determine whether it\n\nmay be maintained as a class action.\"      Id. at 177; see also J.B. ex\n\nrel. Hart v. Valdez, 186 F.3d 1280, 1290 n.7 (10th Cir. 1999)\n\n(recognizing that \"when deciding a motion for class certification,\n\nthe district court should accept the allegations contained in the\n\ncomplaint as true\").\n\n            PolyMedica, on the other hand, argues that we should\n\nfollow the majority of courts of appeals that have addressed this\n\nissue.   According to these courts, a district court is not limited\n\nto the allegations raised in the complaint, and should instead make\n\nwhatever legal and factual inquiries are necessary to an informed\n\ndetermination of the certification issues.        See Unger, 401 F.3d at\n\n321 (stating that while \"[c]lass certification hearings should not\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\fbe mini-trials on the merits of the class or individual claims. .\n\n. . '[g]oing beyond the pleadings is necessary, as a court must\n\nunderstand the claims, defenses, relevant facts, and applicable\n\nsubstantive law in order to make a meaningful determination of the\n\ncertification issues'\") (quoting Castano v. Am. Tobacco Co., 84\n\nF.3d 734, 744 (5th Cir. 1996)); accord Cooper v. Southern Co., 390\n\nF.3d 695, 712 (11th Cir. 2004); Gariety v. Grant Thornton, LLP, 368\n\nF.3d 356, 365 (4th Cir. 2004); West v. Prudential Sec., Inc., 282\n\nF.3d   935,    938    (7th    Cir.    2002)       (\"Tough    questions     [at    class-\n\ncertification        stage]   must    be    faced      and   squarely     decided,    if\n\nnecessary by holding evidentiary hearings and choosing between\n\ncompeting perspectives.\"); Johnston v. HBO Film Mgmt., Inc., 265\n\nF.3d 178, 189 (3rd Cir. 2001); see also Wagner v. Taylor, 836 F.2d\n\n578, 587 (D.C. Cir. 1987) (noting that \"a decision on class\n\ncertification        cannot   be     made    in    a    vacuum,\"    and    that   \"some\n\ninspection     of    the   circumstances          of   the   case   is    essential   to\n\ndetermine whether the prerequisites of Federal Civil Rule 23 have\n\nbeen met\").\n\n              In support of this more demanding inquiry at the class-\n\ncertification stage, many of these courts rely on General Telephone\n\nCo. of Southwest v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147 (1982), in which the\n\nSupreme Court noted that since \"the class determination generally\n\ninvolves considerations that are enmeshed in the factual and legal\n\nissues comprising the plaintiff's cause of action. . . . sometimes\n\n\n                                           -11-\n\fit may be necessary for the court to probe behind the pleadings\n\nbefore coming to rest on the certification question.\"           Id. at 160\n\n(internal quotation marks and citations omitted); see also Amchem,\n\n521 U.S. at 616 (noting that Rule 23(b)(3) involves a \"close look\"\n\nat predominance and superiority criteria).\n\n           We have already expressed our preference for the majority\n\nview.   In Waste Management Holdings, Inc. v. Mowbray, 208 F.3d 288\n\n(1st Cir. 2000), we upheld a district court's decision to certify\n\na class, where the court \"engaged in a case-specific analysis that\n\nwent well beyond the pleadings.\"          Id. at 297.    In that case, we\n\nalso squared the Supreme Court's holdings in Eisen and Falcon,\n\nnoting that while Eisen prohibits a district court from inquiring\n\ninto whether a plaintiff will prevail on the merits at class\n\ncertification, it \"does not foreclose consideration of the probable\n\ncourse of litigation,\" as contemplated by Falcon.              Id. at 298.\n\n\"After all,\" we explained, \"a district court must formulate some\n\nprediction as to how specific issues will play out in order to\n\ndetermine whether common or individual issues predominate in a\n\ngiven case.\"    Id.\n\n           Three years later, in Smilow v. Southwestern Bell Mobile\n\nSystems, 323 F.3d 32 (1st Cir. 2003), we noted that \"[a] district\n\ncourt   must   conduct   a   rigorous   analysis   of   the   prerequisites\n\nestablished by Rule 23 before certifying a class.\"               Id. at 38\n\n(citing Falcon, 457 U.S. at 161).         And last year, in Tardiff, we\n\n                                   -12-\n\fnoted the split between circuits, reasoning that while \"[i]t is\n\nsometimes taken for granted that the complaint's allegations are\n\nnecessarily controlling . . . in our view a court has the power to\n\ntest disputed premises early on if and when the class action would\n\nbe proper on one premise but not another.\"             365 F.3d at 4-5.\n\nTherefore, in light of our prior precedent, we conclude that the\n\ndistrict court was entitled to look beyond the pleadings in its\n\nevaluation    of   the   applicability     of   the   fraud-on-the-market\n\npresumption   of   reliance,   and   its    resolution   of   the   class-\n\ncertification question.\n\n                                  III.\n\nA.        The Fraud-on-the-Market Theory\n\n          The Supreme Court has described the \"basic elements\" of\n\na securities fraud action under § 10(b) of the Exchange Act and\n\nRule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder as including:          (1) \"a material\n\nmisrepresentation (or omission)\"; (2) \"scienter, i.e., a wrongful\n\nstate of mind\"; (3) \"a connection with the purchase or sale of a\n\nsecurity\"; (4) \"reliance\"; (5) \"economic loss\"; and (6) \"loss\n\ncausation.\"    In re Stone & Webster, Inc., Sec. Litig., 414 F.3d\n\n187, 193 (1st Cir. 2005) (quoting Dura Pharm., Inc. v. Broudo, 125\n\nS. Ct. 1627, 1631 (2005)); see also Wortley v. Camplin, 333 F.3d\n\n284, 294 (1st Cir. 2003). While reliance is typically demonstrated\n\non an individual basis, the Supreme Court has noted that such a\n\nrule would effectively foreclose securities fraud class actions\n\n                                  -13-\n\fbecause individual questions of reliance would inevitably overwhelm\n\nthe common ones under Rule 23(b)(3).            Basic, 485 U.S. at 242.\n\n            To avoid this result, the Supreme Court has recognized\n\nthe fraud-on-the-market theory, which relieves the plaintiff of the\n\nburden    of     proving     individualized    reliance   on   a   defendant's\n\nmisstatement, by permitting a rebuttable presumption that the\n\nplaintiff relied on the \"integrity of the market price\" which\n\nreflected that misstatement.10          As the Supreme Court recognized in\n\nBasic, \"[t]he fraud on the market theory is based on the hypothesis\n\nthat, in an open and developed securities market, the price of a\n\ncompany's stock is determined by the available material information\n\nregarding the company and its business,\" including any available\n\nmaterial misstatements.         Id. at 241 (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).          Since investors who purchase or sell stock do\n\nso in reliance on \"the integrity of the market price,\" id. at 247,\n\nthey indirectly rely on such misstatements because they purchase or\n\nsell     stock     at   a     price    which   necessarily     reflects   that\n\nmisrepresentation.             Under    the    fraud-on-the-market    theory,\n\n\"[m]isleading statements will therefore defraud purchasers of stock\n\neven if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements.\"\n\n\n10\n   Assuming the plaintiff gets the benefit of the rebuttable\npresumption at the class-certification stage, the defendant may\nstill rebut this presumption at trial. According to the Court in\nBasic, \"[a]ny showing that severs the link between the alleged\nmisrepresentation and either the price received (or paid) by the\nplaintiff, or his decision to trade at a fair market price, will be\nsufficient to rebut the presumption of reliance.\" 485 U.S. at 248.\n\n                                        -14-\n\fId. at 242-43 (quoting Peil v. Speiser, 806 F.2d 1154, 1160-61 (3d\n\nCir. 1986)); see also Shaw v. Digital Equip. Corp., 82 F.3d 1194,\n\n1218 (1st Cir. 1996) (noting that in cases involving fraud-on-the-\n\nmarket    theory,     \"the    statements       identified    by       plaintiffs    as\n\nactionably misleading are alleged to have caused injury, if at all,\n\nnot through the plaintiffs' direct reliance upon them, but by dint\n\nof the statements' inflating effect on the market price of the\n\nsecurity purchased\").\n\n              Before an investor can be presumed to have relied upon\n\nthe integrity of the market price, however, the market must be\n\n\"efficient\". See Basic, 485 U.S. at 248 n.27 (recognizing elements\n\ncited    by   court    of    appeals    for     invoking    fraud-on-the-market\n\npresumption of reliance, including \"that the shares were traded on\n\nan   efficient    market\").11       Efficiency      refers       to    the   flow   of\n\ninformation      in   the    relevant    market    and     the    effect     of    that\n\n\n11\n  In addition, the plaintiff must prove: \"(1) that the defendant\nmade public misrepresentations; (2) that the misrepresentations\nwere material\" (i.e., that there is a substantial likelihood that\nsuch misrepresentations \"would have been viewed by the reasonable\ninvestor as having significantly altered the 'total mix' of\ninformation made available\"), and \"would induce a reasonable,\nrelying investor to misjudge the value of the shares\"; and (3)\n\"that the plaintiff traded the shares between the time the\nmisrepresentations were made and the time the truth was revealed.\"\nBasic, 485 U.S. at 231-32, 248 n.27 (citing Levinson v.

These factors are not in\ndispute in this interlocutory appeal; therefore, we need not\naddress them.\n\n                                        -15-\n\finformation on the price of the stock.           See In re Laser Arms Corp.\n\nSec. Litig., 794 F. Supp. at 490 (stating that \"[t]he underlying\n\npremise of the fraud on the market theory assumes that the market\n\nis a transmission belt which efficiently translates all information\n\nconcerning a security,\" including misleading information, \"into a\n\nprice\").          In      an     efficient     market,      the    defendant's\n\nmisrepresentations are said to have been absorbed into, and are\n\ntherefore reflected in, the stock price. Conversely, when a market\n\nlacks efficiency, there is no assurance that the market price was\n\naffected by the defendant's alleged misstatement at all.                Instead,\n\nthe   price     may    reflect   information    wholly     unrelated    to   the\n\nmisstatement.         See Freeman v. Laventhol & Horwath, 915 F.2d 193,\n\n198 (6th Cir. 1990) (stating that \"[a]n inefficient market, by\n\ndefinition, does not incorporate into its price all the available\n\ninformation about the value of a security.              Investors, therefore,\n\ncannot be presumed to rely reasonably on the integrity of the\n\nmarket price of a security that is traded in such a market\").\n\n              The fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance and its\n\nrelationship to market efficiency can thus be reduced to the\n\nfollowing syllogism:           (a) an investor buys or sells stock in\n\nreliance   on    the    integrity   of   the   market    price;   (b)   publicly\n\navailable information, including material misrepresentations, is\n\nreflected in the market price; and therefore, (c) the investor buys\n\nor sells stock in reliance on material misrepresentations.                   This\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fsyllogism breaks down, of course, when a market lacks efficiency,\n\nand the market does not necessarily reflect the alleged material\n\nmisrepresentation.   With this understanding as background, we must\n\nnow decide the appropriate standard for determining whether a\n\nmarket is efficient.\n\nB.        The Meaning of \"Market Efficiency\"\n\n          The efficient market hypothesis began as an academic\n\nattempt to answer the following question: Can an ordinary investor\n\nbeat the stock market, that is, can such an investor make trading\n\nprofits on the basis of new information?   In an efficient market,\n\nthe answer is \"no,\" because the information that would have given\n\nthe investor a competitive edge and allowed the investor to \"beat\"\n\nthe market is already reflected in the market price.     See Lynn A.\n\nStout, The Mechanisms of Market Inefficiency:   An Introduction to\n\nthe New Finance, 28 J. Corp. L. 635, 639 (2003) (stating that\n\n\"[t]he common definition of market efficiency . . . is really a\n\nshorthand for the empirical claim that 'available information' does\n\nnot   support   profitable   trading   strategies   or     arbitrage\n\nopportunities\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).12\n\n\n12\n  Commentators note that \"[c]onventional finance recognizes this\ncannot be absolutely true, or no one would have incentive to trade\non information in a way that leads to the incorporation of that\ninformation into prices.\" Stout, supra, at 640 n.24. As further\ndiscussed below, efficient markets are understood to possess enough\nprofit opportunities to allow a small subset of professional\ninvestors, so-called arbitrageurs, to engage in competition with\neach other, thereby moving the price of stock to reflect such\n\n                               -17-\n\fThere is, therefore, no \"bargain\" from which an investor can\n\nbenefit.    Since the stock price fully reflects the information, an\n\ninvestor cannot take advantage of it by either purchasing the stock\n\n(if the information indicates the stock is underpriced) or selling\n\nthe stock (if the information indicates the stock is overpriced).\n\nSee Philip H. Dyvig & Stephen A. Ross, Arbitrage, in 1 The New\n\nPalgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance 48 (Peter Newman et al.\n\neds., 1992) (stating that \"[t]he intuition behind [the efficient\n\nmarket hypothesis] is that if the price does not fully reflect all\n\navailable information, then there is a profit opportunity available\n\nfrom buying the asset if the asset is underpriced or from selling\n\nthe asset if the asset is overpriced\").\n\n            One way information gets absorbed into the market and\n\nreflected in stock price is through arbitrageurs, who obtain and\n\nanalyze    information   about   stocks    from   a   variety    of   sources,\n\nincluding from the issuer, market analysts, and the financial and\n\ntrade press.    In re Verifone Sec. Litig., 784 F. Supp. 1471, 1479\n\n(N.D. Cal. 1992); see generally Ronald J. Gilson & Reinier H.\n\nKraakman, The Mechanisms of Market Efficiency, 70 Va. L. Rev. 549,\n\n566   (1983)   (discussing   variety      of   mechanisms   by    which   new\n\ninformation is incorporated into stock price).          These arbitrageurs\n\nimmediately attempt to profit from such information (for instance,\n\n\n\n\ninformation.\n\n                                   -18-\n\fthrough short sales13), thereby causing the stock to move to a price\n\nwhich reflects the latest public information concerning the stock,\n\nwhere it is no longer possible to generate profits.    See Eckstein\n\nv. Balcor Film Investors, 8 F.3d 1121, 1129 (7th Cir. 1993)\n\n(stating that \"[c]ompetition among savvy investors leads to a price\n\nthat impounds all available information\"); see also Stout, supra,\n\nat 638 n.15 (noting that if arbitrageurs observe a difference\n\nbetween price and value, \"they immediately eliminate it by their\n\ntrading\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).14\n\n          The capacity of arbitrageurs to \"seek out new information\n\nand evaluate its effects on the price of securities\" distinguishes\n\n\n\n13\n  In a short-sale transaction, the seller borrows shares that the\nseller believes to be overvalued from a broker, and pays the broker\na so-called \"loan fee\" for the right to borrow the shares plus\ncollateral (in cash) for the value of the shares (which is held in\nan interest-bearing margin account). The seller agrees to return\nshares of a similar type and amount to the broker at an unspecified\ndate in the future.    The seller then sells the borrowed stock.\nAssuming the price of the stock later decreases, the seller's\nprofit will be the positive difference between the price the seller\npays to replace the borrowed shares (a process known as\n\"covering\"), and the price at which the seller sold the stock. If\nthe price increases before the seller covers its position, the\nseller suffers a loss.\n14\n   Plaintiff offers the following example of an arbitrage\nopportunity. Assume that the price of gold trading on the New York\ncommodities market was $100.50 per ounce, while on the London\nmarket, which opened five hours earlier, the price was only $100\nper ounce.   The arbitrageur could first sell an ounce of gold\n\"short\" in New York, receiving $100.50 in return, and then purchase\nan ounce of gold in London for $100, retaining a profit of $0.50.\nIn an efficient market, the New York market would have swiftly\nmoved to match the London market price as arbitrageurs moved to\nexploit the imbalance in the two markets.\n\n                               -19-\n\fthem from ordinary investors, who \"lack the time, resources, or\n\nexpertise to evaluate all the information concerning a security,\"\n\nand     are   thus   \"unable   to   act   in   time   to   take   advantage   of\n\nopportunities for arbitrage profits.\"           Robert G. Newkirk, Comment,\n\nSufficient Efficiency:         Fraud on the Market in the Initial Public\n\nOffering Context, 58 U. Chi. L. Rev. 1393, 1409 (1991).                  In an\n\nefficient market, then, an ordinary investor \"who becomes aware of\n\npublicly available information cannot make money by trading on it\"\n\nbecause the information will have already been incorporated into\n\nthe market by arbitrageurs.           Stout, supra, at 640.        \"An example\n\nwould be an investor who decides to sell a stock upon the public\n\nannouncement of a decline in corporate earnings, who finds that by\n\nthe time she calls her broker, the price has already dropped.\"\n\nId.15\n\n              According   to    the   prevailing      definition    of   market\n\nefficiency, an efficient market is one in which market price fully\n\n\n\n15\n  The efficient market hypothesis is not without its critics, some\nof whom argue that since not all investors have the means to seek\nout information on stocks or the expertise to decipher it, \"the\nprice of any given stock is not the same as it would be if all\nparticipants were informed; instead it merely reflects 'the actions\nof a mix of informed and uninformed participants.'\"       Brian E.\nPastuszenski & Inez H.

Others\nchallenge what they interpret to be the efficient market\nhypothesis' faulty assumptions about human behavior, that is, that\n\"human beings are rational actors with stable preferences\" who are\n\"never mislead by emotion and who never make foolish mistakes.\"\nStout, supra, at 660 (internal quotation marks omitted).\n\n                                      -20-\n\freflects all publicly available information.         Stout, supra, at 639\n\n(citing Eugene F. Fama, Efficient Capital Markets:             A Review of\n\nTheory   and   Empirical   Work,   25   J.   Fin.   383   (1970)).16   This\n\ndefinition has been adopted by many lower courts as a prerequisite\n\nfor   applying   the   fraud-on-the-market    presumption     of   reliance.\n\nPolyMedica urges us to do likewise, arguing that an \"efficient\"\n\nmarket is an open and developed one, in which a stock price will\n\nmove quickly to reflect all publicly available information.\n\n\n\n16\n   Courts and commentators have noted that this prevailing\ndefinition of market efficiency is consistent with the \"semi-\nstrong\" form of the efficient market hypothesis. See, e.g., In re\nRes. Am. Sec. Litig., 202 F.R.D. 177, 189 (E.D. Penn. 2001)\n(stating that \"[t]he Basic court adopted the semi-strong form of\nmarket efficiency as a prerequisite for a fraud on the market\npresumption\"); Jonathan R. Macey & Geoffrey P. Miller, Good\nFinance, Bad Economics:    An Analysis of the Fraud-on-the-Market\nTheory, 42 Stan. L. Rev. 1059, 1077-78 (1990). There are three\ncompeting forms of this hypothesis – weak, semi-strong, and strong\n– each of which makes a progressively stronger claim about the kind\nof information that is reflected in stock price. Under the weak\nform, an efficient market is one in which historical price data is\nreflected in the current price of the stock, such that an ordinary\ninvestor cannot profit by trading stock based on the historical\nmovements in stock price. Under the semi-strong form, an efficient\nmarket is one in which all publicly available information is\nreflected in the market price of the stock, such that an investor's\nefforts to acquire and analyze public information (about the\ncompany, the industry, or the economy, for instance) will not\nproduce superior investment results.     Finally, under the strong\nform, an efficient market is one in which stock price reflects not\njust historical price data or all publicly available information,\nbut all possible information – both public and private. Based on\nthis form of an efficient market, not even an inside trader can\noutperform other investors because all such information is\nreflected in market price.     Macey & Miller, supra, at 1077-78.\nCommentators have noted that both strong-form and weak-form market\nefficiency are incompatible with the fraud-on-the-market theory.\nId. at 1078-79.\n\n                                   -21-\n\f          The district court, on the other hand, expressly declined\n\nto adopt this prevailing definition of market efficiency.    Relying\n\nupon language gleaned from the Supreme Court's decision in Basic,\n\nthe district court held that \"the 'efficient' market required for\n\n[the] 'fraud on the market' presumption of reliance is simply one\n\nin which 'market professionals generally consider most publicly\n\nannounced material statements about companies, thereby affecting\n\nstock market prices'\"; it \"is not one in which a stock price\n\nrapidly reflects all publicly available material information.\"   In\n\nre PolyMedica Corp. Sec. Litig., 224 F.R.D. at 41 (emphasis in\n\noriginal) (quoting Basic, 485 U.S. at 246 n.24).   Plaintiff agrees\n\nwith the district court's definition, which, he contends, is drawn\n\ndirectly from language used by the Supreme Court in Basic.\n\n          PolyMedica argues that the district court's definition of\n\nmarket efficiency, while rooted in a footnote in Basic, defies the\n\ncontrolling language of Basic, the cases upon which Basic relied,\n\nand the subsequent cases interpreting Basic, all of which support\n\nthe prevailing definition of market efficiency.      Specifically,\n\nPolyMedica argues that the definition adopted by the district court\n\nwrongly focuses on the thought processes of unidentified market\n\nprofessionals and whether stock prices are in some way affected by\n\ntheir consideration of most (but not necessarily all) material\n\npublic information.   The prevailing definition, on the other hand,\n\nrequires a more searching inquiry into whether stock prices fully\n\n\n                               -22-\n\freflect all publicly available information.            We must assess these\n\nconflicting positions of the parties.\n\nC.         The Standard for Determining an Efficient Market\n\n           1.      Basic v. Levinson\n\n           While endorsing the fraud-on-the-market presumption of\n\nreliance in Basic, the Supreme Court did not explicitly address the\n\nmeaning of an \"efficient\" market.          See Gariety, 368 F.3d at 368\n\n(stating that Basic \"offers little guidance for determining whether\n\na market is efficient\").    PolyMedica points to various passages in\n\nBasic   purportedly   showing   a     preference       for   the    prevailing\n\ndefinition of an efficient market, noting the Supreme Court's\n\nstatements that \"[t]he market is acting as the unpaid agent of the\n\ninvestor, informing him that given all the information available to\n\nit, the value of the stock is worth the market price,\" and that\n\n\"the market price of shares traded on well-developed markets\n\nreflects   all   publicly   available      information,      and   hence,   any\n\nmaterial   misrepresentations.\"         Basic,   485    U.S.   at    244,   246\n\n(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n           Elsewhere, however, the Basic decision suggests that\n\nsomething less than \"all publicly available information\" may be\n\nrequired, noting that an investor's reliance may be presumed\n\n\"[b]ecause most publicly available information is reflected in\n\nmarket price,\" id. at 247 (emphasis added).        In separate footnotes\n\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fof the decision, the Court further appeared to resist PolyMedica's\n\nsuggested definition of an efficient market. As pointed out by the\n\ndistrict court, the Supreme Court, after listing several academic\n\narticles, noted that:\n\n     [w]e need not determine by adjudication what economists\n     and social scientists have debated through the use of\n     sophisticated statistical analysis and the application of\n     economic theory.      For purposes of accepting the\n     presumption of reliance in this case, we need only\n     believe that market professionals generally consider most\n     publicly announced material statements about companies,\n     thereby affecting stock market prices.\n\nId. at 246 n.24.   In addition, the Court noted that by accepting a\n\nrebuttable   presumption     of   reliance,   it   \"d[id]   not   intend\n\nconclusively to adopt any particular theory of how quickly and\n\ncompletely publicly available information is reflected in market\n\nprice.\"   Id. at 249 n.28.\n\n           While the Supreme Court's language in Basic provides\n\nsupport for both the district court's definition of an efficient\n\nmarket as well as the prevailing definition urged by PolyMedica,\n\nthe cases relied upon by the Supreme Court in Basic favor the\n\nlatter definition.   In Peil, cited extensively in Basic, the Third\n\nCircuit noted that \"[t]he 'fraud on the market' theory rests on the\n\nassumption that there is a nearly perfect market in information,\n\nand that the market price of stock reacts to and reflects the\n\navailable information.\" Peil, 806 F.2d at 1161 n.10. Likewise, in\n\nIn re LTV Sec. Litig., 88 F.R.D. 134 (N.D. Tex. 1980), which the\n\n\n                                  -24-\n\fSupreme Court also cited, the district court stated that \"[t]he\n\ncentral assumption of the fraud on the market theory [is] that the\n\nmarket price reflects all representations concerning the stock. .\n\n. . [E]fficient capital markets exist when security [sic] prices\n\nreflect all available public information about the economy, about\n\nfinancial markets, and about the specific company involved.\"           Id.\n\nat 144.\n\n           Other cases cited in Basic, including the decision of the\n\nSixth   Circuit   under   review   in   Basic,   similarly   support   the\n\nprevailing definition. See Levinson, 786 F.2d at 750 (stating that\n\n\"[t]he fraud on the market theory is based on two assumptions:\n\nfirst, that in an efficient market the price of stock will reflect\n\nall information available to the public . . . and, second, that an\n\nindividual relies on the integrity of the market price when dealing\n\nin that stock\"); T.J. Raney, Inc. & Sons v. Fort Cobb Irrigation\n\nFuel Auth., 717 F.2d 1330, 1332 (10th Cir. 1983) (stating that\n\n\"[t]he [fraud-on-the-market] theory is grounded on the assumption\n\nthat the market price reflects all known material information\").\n\n           Given the Supreme Court's disclaimer that it was not\n\nadopting any particular economic theory in applying the fraud-on-\n\nthe-market presumption of reliance, on the one hand, and its\n\nembrace of the holdings of cases adopting the prevailing definition\n\nof market efficiency on the other hand, the most that can be said\n\nof Basic is that it did not directly address the meaning of an\n\n                                   -25-\n\fefficient market, choosing instead to leave the development of that\n\nconcept to the lower courts.            See Abell v. Potomac Ins. Co. of\n\nIll., 858 F.2d 1104, 1120 (5th Cir. 1988) (stating that \"Basic\n\nessentially allows each of the circuits room to develop its own\n\nfraud-on-the-market rules\"), vacated on other grounds sub. nom.\n\nFryar v. Abell, 492 U.S. 914 (1989).              Basic is therefore not the\n\nbenchmark for deriving a definition of market efficiency.                 We must\n\nturn to the decisions of the lower courts, post-Basic, for further\n\nguidance.\n\n               2.       Lower   Courts'        Interpretation      of     \"Market\n                        Efficiency\"\n\n               PolyMedica correctly notes that in the wake of Basic,\n\nmany lower courts have accepted a definition of market efficiency\n\nwhich    requires       that   stock   price    fully   reflect   all    publicly\n\navailable information.          The district court conceded as much:             \"I\n\nalso note that the definition I have derived from Basic differs\n\nfrom    much    of    the   existing   case    law.

Litig., 224 F.R.D. at 42.\n\n               The district court's observation was apt. The precedents\n\nfrom other circuits overwhelmingly favor the definition advanced by\n\nPolyMedica.

There, we\n\nstated that under the fraud-on-the-market theory, \"[t]he market\n\nprice of stock is taken to be the basis for investment decisions;\n\nbecause the price reflected all available information, investors\n\nare presumed to have been misled by the nondisclosure.\"         Id. at\n\n27.17\n\n          3.         Other   Arguments   Supporting  the    Prevailing\n                     Definition of \"Market Efficiency\"\n\n          PolyMedica points to statements made by the United States\n\nSecurities     and   Exchange   Commission   (\"SEC\")   supporting   the\n\nprevailing definition of market efficiency.        See Brief for the\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission as Amicus Curiae, Basic v.\n\n\n17\n  We did not, however, determine the standard for market efficiency\nin Roeder. That case required us to decide whether the fraud-on-\nthe-market theory creates an affirmative duty to disclose material\ninformation to the public.    We concluded that it does not, and\nstated that once plaintiffs have demonstrated breach of a duty to\ndisclose material information, the fraud-on-the-market theory\nmerely obviates the need for a plaintiff to prove reliance on the\nnondisclosure. We noted in dicta that this presumption of reliance\nstems from a plaintiff's reliance on market price which necessarily\nreflects that nondisclosure.\n\n                                  -28-\n\fLevinson, 485 U.S. 224 (1988) (No. 86-279), available at 1987 WL\n\n881068, at *22 (stating that fraud-on-the-market theory rests on\n\nproposition that \"in an active secondary market, the price of\n\ncompany's stock is determined by all material information regarding\n\nthe company and its business\"); see also Arthur Levitt, Chairman,\n\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Testimony before House\n\nSubcomm. on Telecomm. & Fin., 104th Cong. 13 (Feb. 10, 1995),\n\navailable at http://www.sec.gov./news/testimony/testarchive/1995/\n\nspch025.txt.\n\n           PolyMedica also argues with some force that the district\n\ncourt's definition is logically inconsistent. By requiring that an\n\nefficient market need only be affected by most but not all material\n\ninformation     in   order   to   be   efficient,   the   district   court's\n\ndefinition allows some information to be considered \"material\" and\n\nyet not affect market price.           Cf. In re Burlington Coat Factory\n\nSec. Litig., 114 F.3d 1410, 1425 (3d Cir. 1997) (stating that \"[i]n\n\nthe context of an 'efficient' market, the concept of materiality\n\ntranslates into information that alters the price of the firm's\n\nstock\").\n\n           4.        \"Market Efficiency\" Defined\n\n           On the basis of the authorities and considerations cited,\n\nwe conclude that the definition of market efficiency adopted by the\n\ndistrict court is inconsistent with the presumption of investor\n\n\n\n                                       -29-\n\freliance at the heart of the fraud-on-the-market theory.           By\n\nrejecting the prevailing definition of market efficiency advocated\n\nby PolyMedica, and focusing instead on the general consideration by\n\nmarket professionals of most publicly announced material statements\n\nabout companies, the district court applied the wrong standard of\n\nefficiency.    For application of the fraud-on-the-market theory, we\n\nconclude that an efficient market is one in which the market price\n\nof the stock fully reflects all publicly available information.\n\n          Anticipating    the   possibility   of   this   definition,\n\nPlaintiff complains that it forces him to prove that market price\n\n\"correctly\" reflects a stock's fundamental value18 before a market\n\nwill be considered efficient.       This argument misconstrues the\n\nconclusion that market price must \"fully reflect\" all publicly\n\navailable information. The words \"fully reflect\" have two distinct\n\nmeanings, each of which points to a different concept of market\n\nefficiency.\n\n          5.       \"Informational\" v. \"Fundamental Value\" Efficiency\n\n          The first meaning of \"fully reflect\" focuses on the\n\nability of the market to digest information, thereby preventing\n\n\n18\n  As we discuss in further detail below, fundamental value is a\ntechnical concept which depends on the present value of expected\nfuture cash flows (e.g., dividends, interest or principal payments,\nliquidations values), \"as estimated by well informed and capable\nanalysts.\"    Jonathan R.

Where the market\n\nreacts   slowly   to   new    information,   it   is   less   likely   that\n\nmisinformation was reflected in market price and therefore relied\n\nupon.

See Fischel, supra, at 912 (enumerating\n\nfactors     relevant    to    determination    of      \"trading-rule\"   [i.e.,\n\n\"informational\"] efficiency, including whether a stock \"is actively\n\ntraded, and whether it is followed by analysts and other market\n\nprofessionals. . . . , [and] the speed of price adjustment to new\n\ninformation [which] can be tested directly by use of widely-\n\naccepted statistical techniques\").\n\n            The second, and much broader meaning of \"fully reflect,\"\n\nfocuses on the price of the stock as a function of its fundamental\n\nvalue:      market price \"fully reflects\" all publicly available\n\ninformation when it responds to information not only quickly but\n\naccurately, such that \"market prices mirror the best possible\n\nestimates, in light of all available information, of the actual\n\neconomic values of securities in terms of their expected risks and\n\nreturns.\"       Stout, supra, at 640.       This is known as \"fundamental\n\nvalue efficiency.\"           See Fischel, supra, at 913 (stating that\n\nfundamental value efficiency \"focuses on the extent to which\n\n                                     -32-\n\fsecurity prices reflect the present value of the net cash flows\n\ngenerated by a firm's assets\").\n\n            Determining         whether    a     market   is    fundamental   value\n\nefficient    is    a    much    more    technical    inquiry     than    determining\n\ninformational efficiency.              Depending on the method of valuation\n\nused, a stock's fundamental value turns on an assessment of various\n\nfactors,    including        \"present     operations,     future    growth    rates,\n\nrelative risk levels, and the future levels of interest rates.\"\n\nNewkirk, supra, at 1399; see, e.g., Stout, supra, at 641, 643-44\n\n(discussing valuation of stocks based on Capital Asset Pricing\n\nModel, which focuses on expected risks and returns); cf. Fischel,\n\nsupra, at 914 (stating that the results of certain kinds of tests\n\nwhich measure \"how closely prices reflect value,\" such as those\n\nwhich measure \"whether the variability of prices is greater than\n\nthe variability of dividends over time . . . . have been extremely\n\ncontroversial\").\n\n            Courts and commentators often use these two concepts of\n\nmarket efficiency interchangeably.                 See Newkirk, supra, at 1407\n\n(stating    that       \"[t]he    manner    in    which    the   courts    apply   the\n\n[efficient market hypothesis] is problematic because courts often\n\nfail   to   distinguish         between   value    efficiency     and    information\n\nefficiency\").19         In     fact,   informational      and   fundamental    value\n\n\n19\n  The parties, themselves, appear to confuse these two concepts.\nIn its briefs to this Court, PolyMedica does not mention accuracy\n\n                                          -33-\n\fefficiency \"often are [] made to go hand-in-hand, with fundamental\n\nvalue efficiency flowing naturally from informational efficiency.\"\n\nSee Stout, supra, at 641.   Despite this blurring of concepts, one\n\nthing is clear: a market can be information efficient without also\n\nbeing fundamental value efficient.    Stout, supra, at 651 (stating\n\nthat \"informational efficiency and fundamental value efficiency are\n\ndistinct concepts\"); see also Fischel, supra, at 913-14.      While\n\nfundamental value efficiency may be the more comprehensive of the\n\ntwo concepts, encompassing both speed and accuracy, \"'[e]fficiency'\n\nis not an all-or-nothing phenomenon.\"   Eckstein, 8 F.3d at 1130.\n\n\n\n\nof stock price as a condition of market efficiency, and explicitly\nstates that an efficient market need not always set a\n\"statistically 'correct price' at each instant.\"      However, the\nreport of PolyMedica's expert, Dr. Neumann Martin, together with\nPolyMedica's surreply to the district court, contend that market\nefficiency requires proof that \"the resulting stock price fully and\ncorrectly reflected the news.\" PolyMedica's surreply goes on to\nstate that \"the case law makes clear that the market for a\nparticular stock must absorb all publicly available information to\nbring about the 'correct price' in order for a market to be\nefficient,\" and furthermore, that \"in an efficient market, the\nprice must accurately reflect the stock's value based on that\ninformation.\" Thus, while PolyMedica purports to argue that the\nPolyMedica market was not efficient in the informational sense,\nPolyMedica occasionally uses language that reflects the broader\nconcept of fundamental value.    By the same token, in his reply\nbrief to this Court, Plaintiff objects to PolyMedica's application\nof a \"correct price\" approach to market efficiency. However, in\nhis response to PolyMedica's surreply to the district court,\nPlaintiff appears to embrace this approach by quoting Hurley v.\nFDIC, 719 F. Supp. 27 (D. Mass. 1989), for the proposition that an\nefficient market is \"one that obtains material information about a\ncompany and accurately reflects that information in the price of\nthe stock.\" Id. at 33 (emphasis added).\n\n                               -34-\n\f           Therefore, by requiring that stock price in an efficient\n\nmarket fully reflect all publicly available information in order to\n\nestablish the fraud-on-the-market presumption, we do not suggest\n\nthat stock price must accurately reflect the fundamental value of\n\nthe stock.   This distinction is well-supported by the legal and\n\neconomic commentary.    See Jill E. Fisch, Picking a Winner, 20 J.\n\nCorp. L. 451, 464 (1995) (book review) (stating that \"[s]tock\n\nprices regularly and persistently depart substantially from present\n\nvalue models as well as from financial variables that would appear\n\nto supply most of the information relevant to a calculation of\n\nfundamental value\"); Baruch Lev & Meiring de Villiers, Stock Prices\n\nand 10B-5 Damages:     A Legal, Economic, and Policy Analysis, 47\n\nStan. L. Rev. 7, 20 (1994) (stating that \"overwhelming empirical\n\nevidence   suggests   that   capital   markets   are   not   fundamentally\n\nefficient\"); Newkirk, supra, at 1399 (noting that a \"major drawback\n\nto fundamental value theory is that it requires a great deal of\n\nspecific, sometimes unobtainable, information\").\n\n           Our focus on whether a particular market has absorbed all\n\navailable information (and misinformation) – such that an ordinary\n\ninvestor cannot beat the market by taking advantage of unexploited\n\nprofit opportunities – is not a fundamental value inquiry.             See\n\nStout, supra, at 651 (stating that \"when finance economists define\n\nmarket efficiency in terms of the difficulty of making arbitrage\n\nprofits, they have implicitly abandoned the more-powerful claim\n\n\n                                  -35-\n\fthat efficient markets price securities accurately\").                          On the\n\ncontrary, for purposes of establishing the fraud-on-the-market\n\npresumption of reliance, investors need only show that the market\n\nwas informationally efficient. See In re Verifone Sec. Litig., 784\n\nF. Supp. at 1479 n.7 (stating that the fraud-on-the-market theory\n\ndoes not require \"proof that the market correctly reflects some\n\n'fundamental value' of the security.               To apply the fraud-on-the-\n\nmarket theory, it is sufficient that the market for a security be\n\n'efficient' only in the sense that market prices reflect the\n\navailable information about the security.\").                      The fraud-on-the-\n\nmarket   theory    is    concerned      with     whether     a    market     processes\n\ninformation in such a way as to justify investor reliance, not\n\nwhether the stock price paid or received by investors was \"correct\"\n\nin the fundamental value sense.\n\n            Still,      as   a   matter    of    logic,    we     cannot     say   that\n\nfundamental value efficiency has no place in applying the fraud-on-\n\nthe-market    presumption        of   reliance    at   the   class-certification\n\nstage.     Evidence bearing on a stock's fundamental value may be\n\nrelevant     to   the    efficiency       determination          as,   for    example,\n\ncircumstantial evidence that arbitrageurs are not trading in the\n\nmarket, with the result that securities prices do not fully reflect\n\nall publicly available information.               In other words, evidence of\n\nfundamental value may be relevant to the extent that it raises\n\nquestions about informational efficiency.               But there are practical\n\n\n                                        -36-\n\flimits on the evidence a court can or should consider during the\n\nclass-certification proceedings.        Courts which choose to consider\n\nsuch fundamental value evidence at the class-certification stage\n\nrun the risk of turning the class-certification proceeding into a\n\nmini-trial on the merits, which must not happen.              See Eisen, 417\n\nU.S. at 178 (stating that \"[i]n determining the propriety of a\n\nclass   action,   the   question   is   not   whether   the    plaintiff   or\n\nplaintiffs . . . will prevail on the merits, but rather whether the\n\nrequirements of Rule 23 are met\") (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).\n\n           6.      Evidence    Necessary      to   Prove   Presumption     of\n                   Reliance\n\n           It is important to remember that the application of the\n\nfraud-on-the-market presumption only establishes just that – a\n\npresumption of reliance.      That reliance can be rebutted at trial.\n\nSee Cammer, 711 F. Supp. at 1290 (stating that \"if it were\n\nconcluded after a hearing [that] the market appeared efficient, and\n\n[that] plaintiffs could proceed under the rebuttable presumption,\n\n[the defendant] would be entitled to prove to a jury that the\n\nmarket was inefficient, thereby rebutting the presumption\"); see\n\nalso Lehocky v. Tidel Techs., Inc., 220 F.R.D. 491, 505 n.16 (S.D.\n\nTex. 2004) (stating that \"[a]t [the class-certification] stage of\n\nthe proceedings, the Court need only inquire whether the stock\n\ntraded in an efficient market and not examine the merits of the\n\n\n                                   -37-\n\fcase. . . . Thus, the Court will not address whether Defendants'\n\n[sic] can rebut the presumption of reliance\").\n\n              As the notes of the Advisory Committee on Rule 301 of the\n\nFederal Rules of Evidence, cited in Basic, make clear, a party need\n\nonly establish \"basic facts\" in order to invoke the presumption of\n\nreliance.     See Basic, 485 U.S. at 245 (citing Rule 301 and Advisory\n\nCommittee Notes in support of statement that \"presumptions are . .\n\n.   useful    devices     for     allocating      the   burden       of    proof   between\n\nparties\"); see also Cammer, 711 F.

District courts must draw these lines sensibly, mindful\n\nthat    evidence     of    fundamental        value     may    be    relevant      to    the\n\ndetermination        of    informational          efficiency,        but       other    more\n\naccessible     and     manageable       evidence      may     be    sufficient     at   the\n\ncertification stage to establish the basic facts that permit a\n\ncourt to apply the fraud-on-the-market presumption.\n\n\n\n\n                                           -38-\n\f          We have no illusions that this line-drawing is easy.\n\nKnowing the high stakes in the class-certification decision,20 the\n\nparties will try to move the court in different directions, with\n\nplaintiffs arguing for less evidence of efficiency and defendants\n\nfor more, some of it highly technical.       Exercising its broad\n\ndiscretion, and understanding the correct definition of efficiency\n\nand the factors relevant to that determination, the district court\n\nmust evaluate the plaintiff's evidence of efficiency critically\n\nwithout allowing the defendant to turn the class-certification\n\nproceeding into an unwieldy trial on the merits.    In this highly\n\nvariable setting, these generalities are the best we can do.\n\n                               IV.\n\n          Having concluded that the district court adopted the\n\nwrong definition of market efficiency, we must now decide whether\n\nthe court's determination that the market for PolyMedica stock was\n\nefficient is nevertheless supportable.   As previously discussed,\n\nthe question of whether a particular market is efficient is a mixed\n\nquestion of law and fact.   While the proper definition of market\n\nefficiency is a purely legal issue reviewed de novo, application of\n\nthis definition to the facts of a case requires district courts to\n\n\n\n20\n  Very few class actions go to trial. See Barbara J. Rothstein &\nThomas E. Willging, Federal Judicial Center, Managing Class Action\nLitigation:   A Pocket Guide for Judges 6 (2005) (stating that\naccording to 2005 study, certified class actions settled ninety\npercent of the time).\n\n                               -39-\n\fmake judgments about the structure of the market for a particular\n\nstock. These judgments are reviewed for clear error. Many factors\n\nbearing on the structure of the market may be relevant to the\n\nefficiency analysis, and courts have wide latitude in deciding what\n\nfactors to apply in a given case, and what weight should be given\n\nto those factors.\n\n          The district court in this case based its analysis of\n\nmarket efficiency on three factors: \"(1) the involvement of market\n\nprofessionals,   (2)   the   degree     to   and   fluidity   with   which\n\ninformation is disseminated, and (3) whether information affected\n\nstock market prices.\"     In re PolyMedica Corp. Sec. Litig., 224\n\nF.R.D. at 42-43.       Applying these factors, the district court\n\ndetermined that the market for PolyMedica stock met the court's\n\ndefinition of market efficiency, that is, \"one in which market\n\nprofessionals generally considered most publicly announced material\n\nstatements about PolyMedica, thereby affecting the stock market\n\nprice.\"   Id. at 43.    The court explicitly rejected PolyMedica's\n\nproffered evidence,21 which focused on whether market price \"fully\n\n\n21\n   PolyMedica submitted the expert report of Dr. Denise Neumann\nMartin, who asserted that constraints on short sales, as evidenced\nby a high degree of shorting, a high cost of borrowing shares, and\nthe inability to find shares to short, prevented would-be short\nsellers from trading on information, thereby preventing the market\nfrom incorporating such information. Dr. Neumann Martin posited\nthat this breakdown in the ability of the market to incorporate\nsuch information resulted in unexploited profit opportunities, as\nevidenced by the results of two tests: the serial correlation test\n(assessing whether an investor can predict price changes based on\nhistorical price data) and the put-call parity test (assessing\n\n                                 -40-\n\fand    rapidly   reflect[ed]    all   the     publicly      available    material\n\ninformation,\" ruling that it was \"not relevant to the definition of\n\nmarket 'efficiency'\" announced by the court.                Id.\n\n            PolyMedica argues that by adopting the wrong definition\n\nof market efficiency, the district court erroneously refused to\n\nconsider    PolyMedica's       evidence      and,   therefore,        erroneously\n\nconcluded that the market for PolyMedica stock was efficient.\n\nPlaintiff argues that regardless of whether the court adopted the\n\nwrong definition of efficiency, the factors analyzed by the court\n\nwere   nevertheless   sufficient      to     support   a    finding     of   market\n\nefficiency under the correct definition of market efficiency that\n\nwe adopt today.     While we agree with Plaintiff that the factors\n\nconsidered by the district court were relevant to the issue of\n\nmarket efficiency, these factors are not exhaustive.                  See Unger,\n\n401 F.3d at 323.    If the district court had used the definition of\n\nmarket efficiency that we adopt today, other factors cited by\n\nPolyMedica may have also been relevant to the efficiency analysis\n\nand may have supported a contrary finding.                 The district court’s\n\nerror, therefore, was not in analyzing the factors that it did, but\n\n\n\nwhether an investor can guarantee a profit by engaging in a series\nof transactions involving a company's stock and its options). We\nmake no judgment on the relevance of this evidence to the efficient\nmarket determination, or the appropriateness of the court's\nconsideration   of   this   evidence   during  class-certification\nproceedings. As we have just indicated, those questions are for\nthe district court to decide in the first instance, applying the\nproper definition of efficiency.\n\n                                      -41-\n\fin applying an erroneous definition of market efficiency that\n\nprevented it from analyzing other arguably relevant evidence.          We\n\nmust therefore vacate its decision and remand for application of\n\nthe proper standard.22\n\n                                   V.\n\n            We summarize the essential points of our analysis.        The\n\ndistrict court was entitled to look beyond the pleadings and\n\nconsider evidence in its evaluation of the applicability of the\n\nfraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance, and in its resolution\n\nof the class-certification question.       However, the district court\n\nadopted a standard of market efficiency at odds with the prevailing\n\nstandard,    holding   that   market    efficiency   means   that   market\n\nprofessionals generally consider most publicly announced material\n\nstatements about companies, thereby affecting stock market prices.\n\nThis was error.\n\n            For purposes of establishing the fraud-on-the-market\n\npresumption of reliance, we adopt the prevailing definition of\n\nmarket efficiency, which provides that an efficient market is one\n\n\n22\n  In its order granting class certification, the district court\nspecifically excluded all short-sellers from the class, noting that\nshort-sellers do not rely on the integrity of the market price\n(rather, they believe the market price is too high), and therefore\nare not entitled to a fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance.\nPolyMedica argues that, even if the market for PolyMedica was\nefficient during the Contested Time Period, class certification\nstill should not have been granted because the class is not\n\"ascertainable.\"   Because we vacate the district court's order\ncertifying the class, we need not decide this issue.\n\n                                  -42-\n\fin which the market price of the stock fully reflects all publicly\n\navailable information.          By \"fully reflect,\" we mean that market\n\nprice   responds     so    quickly    to   new    information       that    ordinary\n\ninvestors    cannot    make     trading    profits      on   the    basis    of   such\n\ninformation.       This is known as \"informational efficiency.\"                    We\n\nreject a second and much broader meaning of \"fully reflect,\" known\n\nas \"fundamental value efficiency,\" which requires that a market\n\nrespond to information not only quickly but accurately, such that\n\nthe market price of a stock reflects its fundamental value.\n\n            While evidence of a stock's fundamental value may be\n\nrelevant to the extent that it raises questions about informational\n\nefficiency, courts which choose to consider such fundamental value\n\nevidence at the class-certification stage run the risk of turning\n\nthe class-certification proceeding into a mini-trial on the merits,\n\nwhich must not happen.         The fraud-on-the-market presumption, after\n\nall, only establishes a presumption of reliance which can be\n\nrebutted at trial.        At the class-certification stage, a party need\n\nonly establish \"basic facts\" in order to invoke the presumption of\n\nreliance.     The question of how much evidence of efficiency is\n\nnecessary    to    establish    the    fraud-on-the-market          presumption    of\n\nreliance is one of degree.              While district courts have broad\n\ndiscretion    to    draw    these     lines,     they   must   do    so     sensibly,\n\nunderstanding the correct definition of efficiency and the factors\n\nrelevant to that determination.\n\n\n                                       -43-\n\f           Having    concluded   this   analysis,   we   must   vacate   the\n\ndistrict   court's    order   certifying   the   class   for    the   period\n\nbeginning January 2001 and ending August 2001, and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each party shall\n\nbear its own costs of appeal.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -44-\n\f",

In this appeal pursuant to Rule\n\n23(f) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure from an order\n\ncertifying a class in a securities fraud case, we must decide an\n\nissue of first impression in this Circuit:            the standard for\n\ndetermining whether a market was \"efficient\" when applying the\n\nfraud-on-the-market presumption of investor reliance.            We also\n\naddress the level of inquiry that a district court may pursue at\n\nthe    class-certification   stage   when   making    that     efficiency\n\ndetermination.     Defendants-Appellants     PolyMedica      Corporation,\n\nLiberty Medical Supply, Inc. (\"Liberty\"), and various officers of\n\nboth   companies   (collectively,    \"PolyMedica\"1)   argue    that   the\n\ndistrict court erred in finding that common questions predominated\n\nunder Rule 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, by\n\ndetermining that the market was efficient for eight months of the\n\nclass period, from January 2001 through August 2001 (the \"Contested\n\nTime Period\"), and deeming PolyMedica's expert evidence irrelevant\n\nto that determination.   For the reasons set forth below, we vacate\n\nthe district court's order certifying the class for the Contested\n\nTime Period, and remand for further proceedings.\n\n\n\n\n1\n  For the sake of simplicity, we refer to both Defendants-\nAppellants who bring this appeal, together with the company whose\nstock is at issue in this case, PolyMedica Corporation, as\n\"PolyMedica.\"\n\n                                 -3-\n\f                                        I.\n\n           Thomas Thuma (\"Plaintiff\") is a purchaser of PolyMedica\n\nstock,   who   seeks    to   represent    a   class    of    all    purchasers   of\n\nPolyMedica     stock    from    October       1998    through       August    2001.2\n\nPolyMedica is the parent company of Liberty, a seller of diabetic\n\ntesting supplies.        According to Plaintiff, PolyMedica reported\n\nrecord   revenues      and   earnings    during      the    class    period   based\n\nprimarily on the growth of Liberty's diabetic supplies business,\n\nwhich accounted for up to 80% of PolyMedica's revenues.                        As a\n\nresult of these increases in revenue and earnings, the price of\n\nPolyMedica's stock, which traded on the NASDAQ3 and the American\n\nStock Exchange during the class period, increased substantially.\n\n\n\n2\n  This is a consolidated action. On November 27, 2000, Richard\nBowe, SEP-IRA, filed a federal securities class action against\nPolyMedica Corporation and its Chief Executive Officer, Steven J.\nLee. A like action was subsequently filed by Trust Advisors Equity\nPlus LLC on December 19, 2000. The district court consolidated the\ntwo cases on July 30, 2001, and allowed a motion appointing Bowe,\nJohn T. Muha, and Thomas Thuma as lead plaintiffs and approving\ntheir selection of lead counsel. On October 9, 2001, the three\nlead plaintiffs, together with three other plaintiffs, Lawrence\nStorey, Jianwei Xu, and Howard Hoffman, filed a consolidated\ncomplaint. The district court subsequently allowed Bowe and Muha\nto withdraw, leaving Thomas Thuma as lead plaintiff. For the sake\nof simplicity, we treat all the plaintiffs' filings as being made\nby Thuma.\n3\n  \"NASDAQ\" stands for the National Association of Securities\nDealers Automated Quotation, \"the largest electronic, screen-based\nmarket in the world. . . .

While reliance is typically demonstrated\n\non an individual basis, the Supreme Court has noted that such a\n\nrule would effectively foreclose securities fraud class actions\n\n                                  -13-\n\fbecause individual questions of reliance would inevitably overwhelm\n\nthe common ones under Rule 23(b)(3).            Basic, 485 U.S. at 242.\n\n            To avoid this result, the Supreme Court has recognized\n\nthe fraud-on-the-market theory, which relieves the plaintiff of the\n\nburden    of     proving     individualized    reliance   on   a   defendant's\n\nmisstatement, by permitting a rebuttable presumption that the\n\nplaintiff relied on the \"integrity of the market price\" which\n\nreflected that misstatement.10          As the Supreme Court recognized in\n\nBasic, \"[t]he fraud on the market theory is based on the hypothesis\n\nthat, in an open and developed securities market, the price of a\n\ncompany's stock is determined by the available material information\n\nregarding the company and its business,\" including any available\n\nmaterial misstatements.         Id. at 241 (internal quotation marks and\n\ncitation omitted).          Since investors who purchase or sell stock do\n\nso in reliance on \"the integrity of the market price,\" id. at 247,\n\nthey indirectly rely on such misstatements because they purchase or\n\nsell     stock     at   a     price    which   necessarily     reflects   that\n\nmisrepresentation.             Under    the    fraud-on-the-market    theory,\n\n\"[m]isleading statements will therefore defraud purchasers of stock\n\neven if the purchasers do not directly rely on the misstatements.\"\n\n\n10\n   Assuming the plaintiff gets the benefit of the rebuttable\npresumption at the class-certification stage, the defendant may\nstill rebut this presumption at trial. According to the Court in\nBasic, \"[a]ny showing that severs the link between the alleged\nmisrepresentation and either the price received (or paid) by the\nplaintiff, or his decision to trade at a fair market price, will be\nsufficient to rebut the presumption of reliance.\" 485 U.S. at 248.\n\n                                        -14-\n\fId. at 242-43 (quoting Peil v.

With this understanding as background, we must\n\nnow decide the appropriate standard for determining whether a\n\nmarket is efficient.\n\nB.        The Meaning of \"Market Efficiency\"\n\n          The efficient market hypothesis began as an academic\n\nattempt to answer the following question: Can an ordinary investor\n\nbeat the stock market, that is, can such an investor make trading\n\nprofits on the basis of new information?   In an efficient market,\n\nthe answer is \"no,\" because the information that would have given\n\nthe investor a competitive edge and allowed the investor to \"beat\"\n\nthe market is already reflected in the market price.     See Lynn A.\n\nStout, The Mechanisms of Market Inefficiency:   An Introduction to\n\nthe New Finance, 28 J. Corp. L. 635, 639 (2003) (stating that\n\n\"[t]he common definition of market efficiency . . . is really a\n\nshorthand for the empirical claim that 'available information' does\n\nnot   support   profitable   trading   strategies   or     arbitrage\n\nopportunities\") (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).12\n\n\n12\n  Commentators note that \"[c]onventional finance recognizes this\ncannot be absolutely true, or no one would have incentive to trade\non information in a way that leads to the incorporation of that\ninformation into prices.\" Stout, supra, at 640 n.24. As further\ndiscussed below, efficient markets are understood to possess enough\nprofit opportunities to allow a small subset of professional\ninvestors, so-called arbitrageurs, to engage in competition with\neach other, thereby moving the price of stock to reflect such\n\n                               -17-\n\fThere is, therefore, no \"bargain\" from which an investor can\n\nbenefit.    Since the stock price fully reflects the information, an\n\ninvestor cannot take advantage of it by either purchasing the stock\n\n(if the information indicates the stock is underpriced) or selling\n\nthe stock (if the information indicates the stock is overpriced).\n\nSee Philip H. Dyvig & Stephen A. Ross, Arbitrage, in 1 The New\n\nPalgrave Dictionary of Money and Finance 48 (Peter Newman et al.\n\neds., 1992) (stating that \"[t]he intuition behind [the efficient\n\nmarket hypothesis] is that if the price does not fully reflect all\n\navailable information, then there is a profit opportunity available\n\nfrom buying the asset if the asset is underpriced or from selling\n\nthe asset if the asset is overpriced\").\n\n            One way information gets absorbed into the market and\n\nreflected in stock price is through arbitrageurs, who obtain and\n\nanalyze    information   about   stocks    from   a   variety    of   sources,\n\nincluding from the issuer, market analysts, and the financial and\n\ntrade press.

The seller agrees to return\nshares of a similar type and amount to the broker at an unspecified\ndate in the future.    The seller then sells the borrowed stock.\nAssuming the price of the stock later decreases, the seller's\nprofit will be the positive difference between the price the seller\npays to replace the borrowed shares (a process known as\n\"covering\"), and the price at which the seller sold the stock.

Assume that the price of gold trading on the New York\ncommodities market was $100.50 per ounce, while on the London\nmarket, which opened five hours earlier, the price was only $100\nper ounce.   The arbitrageur could first sell an ounce of gold\n\"short\" in New York, receiving $100.50 in return, and then purchase\nan ounce of gold in London for $100, retaining a profit of $0.50.\nIn an efficient market, the New York market would have swiftly\nmoved to match the London market price as arbitrageurs moved to\nexploit the imbalance in the two markets.\n\n                               -19-\n\fthem from ordinary investors, who \"lack the time, resources, or\n\nexpertise to evaluate all the information concerning a security,\"\n\nand     are   thus   \"unable   to   act   in   time   to   take   advantage   of\n\nopportunities for arbitrage profits.\"           Robert G.

Miller, Good\nFinance, Bad Economics:    An Analysis of the Fraud-on-the-Market\nTheory, 42 Stan. L. Rev. 1059, 1077-78 (1990). There are three\ncompeting forms of this hypothesis – weak, semi-strong, and strong\n– each of which makes a progressively stronger claim about the kind\nof information that is reflected in stock price. Under the weak\nform, an efficient market is one in which historical price data is\nreflected in the current price of the stock, such that an ordinary\ninvestor cannot profit by trading stock based on the historical\nmovements in stock price. Under the semi-strong form, an efficient\nmarket is one in which all publicly available information is\nreflected in the market price of the stock, such that an investor's\nefforts to acquire and analyze public information (about the\ncompany, the industry, or the economy, for instance) will not\nproduce superior investment results.     Finally, under the strong\nform, an efficient market is one in which stock price reflects not\njust historical price data or all publicly available information,\nbut all possible information – both public and private. Based on\nthis form of an efficient market, not even an inside trader can\noutperform other investors because all such information is\nreflected in market price.

Relying\n\nupon language gleaned from the Supreme Court's decision in Basic,\n\nthe district court held that \"the 'efficient' market required for\n\n[the] 'fraud on the market' presumption of reliance is simply one\n\nin which 'market professionals generally consider most publicly\n\nannounced material statements about companies, thereby affecting\n\nstock market prices'\"; it \"is not one in which a stock price\n\nrapidly reflects all publicly available material information.\"   In\n\nre PolyMedica Corp. Sec. Litig., 224 F.R.D. at 41 (emphasis in\n\noriginal) (quoting Basic, 485 U.S. at 246 n.24).   Plaintiff agrees\n\nwith the district court's definition, which, he contends, is drawn\n\ndirectly from language used by the Supreme Court in Basic.\n\n          PolyMedica argues that the district court's definition of\n\nmarket efficiency, while rooted in a footnote in Basic, defies the\n\ncontrolling language of Basic, the cases upon which Basic relied,\n\nand the subsequent cases interpreting Basic, all of which support\n\nthe prevailing definition of market efficiency.      Specifically,\n\nPolyMedica argues that the definition adopted by the district court\n\nwrongly focuses on the thought processes of unidentified market\n\nprofessionals and whether stock prices are in some way affected by\n\ntheir consideration of most (but not necessarily all) material\n\npublic information.   The prevailing definition, on the other hand,\n\nrequires a more searching inquiry into whether stock prices fully\n\n\n                               -22-\n\freflect all publicly available information.            We must assess these\n\nconflicting positions of the parties.\n\nC.         The Standard for Determining an Efficient Market\n\n           1.      Basic v. Levinson\n\n           While endorsing the fraud-on-the-market presumption of\n\nreliance in Basic, the Supreme Court did not explicitly address the\n\nmeaning of an \"efficient\" market.          See Gariety, 368 F.3d at 368\n\n(stating that Basic \"offers little guidance for determining whether\n\na market is efficient\").    PolyMedica points to various passages in\n\nBasic   purportedly   showing   a     preference       for   the    prevailing\n\ndefinition of an efficient market, noting the Supreme Court's\n\nstatements that \"[t]he market is acting as the unpaid agent of the\n\ninvestor, informing him that given all the information available to\n\nit, the value of the stock is worth the market price,\" and that\n\n\"the market price of shares traded on well-developed markets\n\nreflects   all   publicly   available      information,      and   hence,   any\n\nmaterial   misrepresentations.\"         Basic,   485    U.S.   at    244,   246\n\n(emphasis added) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\n\n           Elsewhere, however, the Basic decision suggests that\n\nsomething less than \"all publicly available information\" may be\n\nrequired, noting that an investor's reliance may be presumed\n\n\"[b]ecause most publicly available information is reflected in\n\nmarket price,\" id. at 247 (emphasis added).        In separate footnotes\n\n\n\n                                    -23-\n\fof the decision, the Court further appeared to resist PolyMedica's\n\nsuggested definition of an efficient market. As pointed out by the\n\ndistrict court, the Supreme Court, after listing several academic\n\narticles, noted that:\n\n     [w]e need not determine by adjudication what economists\n     and social scientists have debated through the use of\n     sophisticated statistical analysis and the application of\n     economic theory.      For purposes of accepting the\n     presumption of reliance in this case, we need only\n     believe that market professionals generally consider most\n     publicly announced material statements about companies,\n     thereby affecting stock market prices.\n\nId. at 246 n.24.   In addition, the Court noted that by accepting a\n\nrebuttable   presumption     of   reliance,   it   \"d[id]   not   intend\n\nconclusively to adopt any particular theory of how quickly and\n\ncompletely publicly available information is reflected in market\n\nprice.\"   Id. at 249 n.28.\n\n           While the Supreme Court's language in Basic provides\n\nsupport for both the district court's definition of an efficient\n\nmarket as well as the prevailing definition urged by PolyMedica,\n\nthe cases relied upon by the Supreme Court in Basic favor the\n\nlatter definition.   In Peil, cited extensively in Basic, the Third\n\nCircuit noted that \"[t]he 'fraud on the market' theory rests on the\n\nassumption that there is a nearly perfect market in information,\n\nand that the market price of stock reacts to and reflects the\n\navailable information.\" Peil, 806 F.2d at 1161 n.10.

See Newkirk, supra, at 1407\n\n(stating    that       \"[t]he    manner    in    which    the   courts    apply   the\n\n[efficient market hypothesis] is problematic because courts often\n\nfail   to   distinguish         between   value    efficiency     and    information\n\nefficiency\").19         In     fact,   informational      and   fundamental    value\n\n\n19\n  The parties, themselves, appear to confuse these two concepts.\nIn its briefs to this Court, PolyMedica does not mention accuracy\n\n                                          -33-\n\fefficiency \"often are [] made to go hand-in-hand, with fundamental\n\nvalue efficiency flowing naturally from informational efficiency.\"\n\nSee Stout, supra, at 641.

Stout, supra, at 651 (stating\n\nthat \"informational efficiency and fundamental value efficiency are\n\ndistinct concepts\"); see also Fischel, supra, at 913-14.      While\n\nfundamental value efficiency may be the more comprehensive of the\n\ntwo concepts, encompassing both speed and accuracy, \"'[e]fficiency'\n\nis not an all-or-nothing phenomenon.\"   Eckstein, 8 F.3d at 1130.\n\n\n\n\nof stock price as a condition of market efficiency, and explicitly\nstates that an efficient market need not always set a\n\"statistically 'correct price' at each instant.\"      However, the\nreport of PolyMedica's expert, Dr. Neumann Martin, together with\nPolyMedica's surreply to the district court, contend that market\nefficiency requires proof that \"the resulting stock price fully and\ncorrectly reflected the news.\" PolyMedica's surreply goes on to\nstate that \"the case law makes clear that the market for a\nparticular stock must absorb all publicly available information to\nbring about the 'correct price' in order for a market to be\nefficient,\" and furthermore, that \"in an efficient market, the\nprice must accurately reflect the stock's value based on that\ninformation.\" Thus, while PolyMedica purports to argue that the\nPolyMedica market was not efficient in the informational sense,\nPolyMedica occasionally uses language that reflects the broader\nconcept of fundamental value.    By the same token, in his reply\nbrief to this Court, Plaintiff objects to PolyMedica's application\nof a \"correct price\" approach to market efficiency. However, in\nhis response to PolyMedica's surreply to the district court,\nPlaintiff appears to embrace this approach by quoting Hurley v.\nFDIC, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1438209\"><a href=\"/opinion/1438209/hurley-v-federal-deposit-ins-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">719</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

This distinction is well-supported by the legal and\n\neconomic commentary.    See Jill E. Fisch, Picking a Winner, 20 J.\n\nCorp.

On the\n\ncontrary, for purposes of establishing the fraud-on-the-market\n\npresumption of reliance, investors need only show that the market\n\nwas informationally efficient. See In re Verifone Sec.

To apply the fraud-on-the-\n\nmarket theory, it is sufficient that the market for a security be\n\n'efficient' only in the sense that market prices reflect the\n\navailable information about the security.\").                      The fraud-on-the-\n\nmarket   theory    is    concerned      with     whether     a    market     processes\n\ninformation in such a way as to justify investor reliance, not\n\nwhether the stock price paid or received by investors was \"correct\"\n\nin the fundamental value sense.\n\n            Still,      as   a   matter    of    logic,    we     cannot     say   that\n\nfundamental value efficiency has no place in applying the fraud-on-\n\nthe-market    presumption        of   reliance    at   the   class-certification\n\nstage.     Evidence bearing on a stock's fundamental value may be\n\nrelevant     to   the    efficiency       determination          as,   for    example,\n\ncircumstantial evidence that arbitrageurs are not trading in the\n\nmarket, with the result that securities prices do not fully reflect\n\nall publicly available information.

Many factors\n\nbearing on the structure of the market may be relevant to the\n\nefficiency analysis, and courts have wide latitude in deciding what\n\nfactors to apply in a given case, and what weight should be given\n\nto those factors.\n\n          The district court in this case based its analysis of\n\nmarket efficiency on three factors: \"(1) the involvement of market\n\nprofessionals,   (2)   the   degree     to   and   fluidity   with   which\n\ninformation is disseminated, and (3) whether information affected\n\nstock market prices.\"     In re PolyMedica Corp. Sec. Litig., 224\n\nF.R.D. at 42-43.       Applying these factors, the district court\n\ndetermined that the market for PolyMedica stock met the court's\n\ndefinition of market efficiency, that is, \"one in which market\n\nprofessionals generally considered most publicly announced material\n\nstatements about PolyMedica, thereby affecting the stock market\n\nprice.\"   Id. at 43.    The court explicitly rejected PolyMedica's\n\nproffered evidence,21 which focused on whether market price \"fully\n\n\n21\n   PolyMedica submitted the expert report of Dr. Denise Neumann\nMartin, who asserted that constraints on short sales, as evidenced\nby a high degree of shorting, a high cost of borrowing shares, and\nthe inability to find shares to short, prevented would-be short\nsellers from trading on information, thereby preventing the market\nfrom incorporating such information. Dr. Neumann Martin posited\nthat this breakdown in the ability of the market to incorporate\nsuch information resulted in unexploited profit opportunities, as\nevidenced by the results of two tests: the serial correlation test\n(assessing whether an investor can predict price changes based on\nhistorical price data) and the put-call parity test (assessing\n\n                                 -40-\n\fand    rapidly   reflect[ed]    all   the     publicly      available    material\n\ninformation,\" ruling that it was \"not relevant to the definition of\n\nmarket 'efficiency'\" announced by the court.                Id.\n\n            PolyMedica argues that by adopting the wrong definition\n\nof market efficiency, the district court erroneously refused to\n\nconsider    PolyMedica's       evidence      and,   therefore,        erroneously\n\nconcluded that the market for PolyMedica stock was efficient.\n\nPlaintiff argues that regardless of whether the court adopted the\n\nwrong definition of efficiency, the factors analyzed by the court\n\nwere   nevertheless   sufficient      to     support   a    finding     of   market\n\nefficiency under the correct definition of market efficiency that\n\nwe adopt today.     While we agree with Plaintiff that the factors\n\nconsidered by the district court were relevant to the issue of\n\nmarket efficiency, these factors are not exhaustive.                  See Unger,\n\n401 F.3d at 323.    If the district court had used the definition of\n\nmarket efficiency that we adopt today, other factors cited by\n\nPolyMedica may have also been relevant to the efficiency analysis\n\nand may have supported a contrary finding.                 The district court’s\n\nerror, therefore, was not in analyzing the factors that it did, but\n\n\n\nwhether an investor can guarantee a profit by engaging in a series\nof transactions involving a company's stock and its options). We\nmake no judgment on the relevance of this evidence to the efficient\nmarket determination, or the appropriateness of the court's\nconsideration   of   this   evidence   during  class-certification\nproceedings. As we have just indicated, those questions are for\nthe district court to decide in the first instance, applying the\nproper definition of efficiency.\n\n                                      -41-\n\fin applying an erroneous definition of market efficiency that\n\nprevented it from analyzing other arguably relevant evidence.          We\n\nmust therefore vacate its decision and remand for application of\n\nthe proper standard.22\n\n                                   V.\n\n            We summarize the essential points of our analysis.        The\n\ndistrict court was entitled to look beyond the pleadings and\n\nconsider evidence in its evaluation of the applicability of the\n\nfraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance, and in its resolution\n\nof the class-certification question.       However, the district court\n\nadopted a standard of market efficiency at odds with the prevailing\n\nstandard,    holding   that   market    efficiency   means   that   market\n\nprofessionals generally consider most publicly announced material\n\nstatements about companies, thereby affecting stock market prices.\n\nThis was error.\n\n            For purposes of establishing the fraud-on-the-market\n\npresumption of reliance, we adopt the prevailing definition of\n\nmarket efficiency, which provides that an efficient market is one\n\n\n22\n  In its order granting class certification, the district court\nspecifically excluded all short-sellers from the class, noting that\nshort-sellers do not rely on the integrity of the market price\n(rather, they believe the market price is too high), and therefore\nare not entitled to a fraud-on-the-market presumption of reliance.\nPolyMedica argues that, even if the market for PolyMedica was\nefficient during the Contested Time Period, class certification\nstill should not have been granted because the class is not\n\"ascertainable.\"   Because we vacate the district court's order\ncertifying the class, we need not decide this issue.\n\n                                  -42-\n\fin which the market price of the stock fully reflects all publicly\n\navailable information.          By \"fully reflect,\" we mean that market\n\nprice   responds     so    quickly    to   new    information       that    ordinary\n\ninvestors    cannot    make     trading    profits      on   the    basis    of   such\n\ninformation.       This is known as \"informational efficiency.\"                    We\n\nreject a second and much broader meaning of \"fully reflect,\" known\n\nas \"fundamental value efficiency,\" which requires that a market\n\nrespond to information not only quickly but accurately, such that\n\nthe market price of a stock reflects its fundamental value.\n\n            While evidence of a stock's fundamental value may be\n\nrelevant to the extent that it raises questions about informational\n\nefficiency, courts which choose to consider such fundamental value\n\nevidence at the class-certification stage run the risk of turning\n\nthe class-certification proceeding into a mini-trial on the merits,\n\nwhich must not happen.         The fraud-on-the-market presumption, after\n\nall, only establishes a presumption of reliance which can be\n\nrebutted at trial.        At the class-certification stage, a party need\n\nonly establish \"basic facts\" in order to invoke the presumption of\n\nreliance.     The question of how much evidence of efficiency is\n\nnecessary    to    establish    the    fraud-on-the-market          presumption    of\n\nreliance is one of degree.              While district courts have broad\n\ndiscretion    to    draw    these     lines,     they   must   do    so     sensibly,\n\nunderstanding the correct definition of efficiency and the factors\n\nrelevant to that determination.\n\n\n                                       -43-\n\f           Having    concluded   this   analysis,   we   must   vacate   the\n\ndistrict   court's    order   certifying   the   class   for    the   period\n\nbeginning January 2001 and ending August 2001, and remand for\n\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion. Each party shall\n\nbear its own costs of appeal.\n\n           So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -44-\n\f</pre>",
