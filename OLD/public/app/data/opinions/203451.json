Alan S. Noonan was fired from\n\nhis job as a salesman at Staples, Inc. for allegedly padding\n\nexpense reports.   A Staples executive then sent a mass e-mail to\n\nabout 1,500 employees informing them that Noonan had been fired for\n\nviolating the company's travel and expense policy.     Staples also\n\ndenied Noonan his severance benefits and refused to allow him to\n\nexercise his stock options, claiming that, under the terms of the\n\nagreements setting forth the right to these benefits, Noonan was\n\nineligible because he had been fired \"for cause.\"       Noonan sued\n\nStaples in Massachusetts court for libel and breach of those\n\nagreements, and Staples removed to federal court.      Both parties\n\nmoved for summary judgment, the district court granted summary\n\njudgment in favor of Staples, and Noonan now appeals.         After\n\ncareful consideration, we affirm.\n\n                          I.   Background\n\n          Because this case comes to us on appeal from summary\n\njudgment, we relate the relevant facts in the light that most\n\nfavors the nonmovant, Noonan. Franceschi v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans\n\nAffairs, 514 F.3d 81, 83 (1st Cir. 2008).      Noonan was a Staples\n\nsales director who did much traveling for business and had to\n\ncompile expense reports to be reimbursed for travel, food, and\n\nother business-related expenses.    Staples had a travel and expense\n\npolicy requiring employees to submit receipts for all expenses over\n\n$75, and for all meals regardless of price; to use their corporate\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fcredit card for business expenses instead of their personal credit\n\ncard; and to book all work-related travel through Staples's travel\n\ndepartment.    Noonan claims, with support in the record, that these\n\ndirectives were irregularly enforced and often not followed by many\n\nemployees.\n\n            In November 2005, Staples discovered that an employee\n\nnamed James Dorman had been embezzling money from the company\n\nthrough fraudulent expense claims and fired him. It then undertook\n\nan audit of expense reports based on a sample of sixty-five\n\ntraveling employees in the North American Division, including\n\nNoonan.      Auditors investigating Noonan discovered a May 2005\n\nexpense report in which he had requested $1,622 in excess of what\n\nhe had actually spent.       The team also found that Noonan had used\n\nhis personal credit card for many of these purchases, had booked\n\nthe travel through a non-company travel agent, and had failed to\n\nsubmit all the required receipts.\n\n            These anomalies led Staples to assemble a special team,\n\ncomposed of certified accountants and a former police investigator,\n\nto   look   further   into   Noonan's   past   expense   reports.   Noonan\n\nadmitted to the team that he often \"pre-populated\" his reports\n\nbefore a given trip -- that is, he estimated what his expenses\n\nwould be in advance, and submitted the report with these estimates,\n\nbut with (Noonan claims) the intention to amend the report later to\n\nthe extent the actual expenses differed from the estimates.           The\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fteam found that Noonan had failed to enter such adjustments on a\n\nnumber of expense reports and discovered other anomalies, such as\n\nentries where the amount claimed was exactly $100 more than what\n\nthe item actually cost, and entries where decimal points had been\n\nshifted two places to the right (resulting, for example, in an\n\n$1,129 meal at an airport McDonald's, instead of $11.29).    Noonan\n\nalso committed errors in Staples's favor.   When the team asked him\n\nabout the large amounts of extra money that had been deposited into\n\nhis checking account, Noonan responded that he had not noticed.\n\n          Based on its findings, the team unanimously concluded\n\nthat Noonan had deliberately falsified the audited expense reports\n\nand, as a result, Staples fired him.   It sent him a letter stating\n\nthat he had been terminated \"for cause\" for violating the travel\n\nand expense policy and the company's Code of Ethics, and that he\n\nwas consequently ineligible for severance benefits.    The following\n\nday, Executive Vice-President Jay Baitler sent an e-mail to all the\n\nemployees in Staples's North American Division, a group whose\n\nprecise number is unknown and disputed, but that totaled somewhere\n\naround 1,500 people.   The e-mail stated as follows:\n\n          It is with sincere regret that I must inform\n          you of the termination of Alan Noonan's\n          employment   with   Staples.     A   thorough\n          investigation determined that Alan was not in\n          compliance with our [travel and expenses]\n          policies.     As always, our policies are\n          consistently    applied   to   everyone   and\n          compliance is mandatory on everyone's part.\n          It is incumbent on all managers to understand\n          Staples['s] policies and to consistently\n\n                                -4-\n\f          communicate, educate and monitor compliance\n          every single day.     Compliance with company\n          policies is not subject to personal discretion\n          and is not optional. In addition to ensuring\n          compliance, the approver's responsibility to\n          monitor and question is a critical factor in\n          effective management of this and all policies.\n\n          If you have any questions about Staples['s]\n          policies or Code of Ethics, call the Ethics\n          Hotline . . . or ask your human resources\n          manager.\n\n          Over the course of Noonan's employment, he and Staples\n\nentered into two stock-option agreements, dating respectively from\n\n1992 and 2004 (respectively, the \"1992 Stock-Option Agreement\" and\n\nthe \"2004 Stock-Option Agreement\").   The pertinent language in the\n\n1992 Stock-Option Agreement provided as follows:\n\n          [I]f [Noonan's] relationship with Staples is\n          terminated by Staples for \"cause\" (as defined\n          below) . . . the right to exercise this option\n          with respect to any shares not previously\n          exercised shall terminate immediately . . . .\n\n          \"Cause\" shall mean willful misconduct by\n          [Noonan] or willful failure to perform his or\n          her responsibilities in the best interests of\n          Staples (including, without limitation, breach\n          by   [Noonan]   of   any   provision    of   any\n          employment,       consulting,       advisory,\n          nondisclosure,    non-competition    or    other\n          similar   agreement    between   [Noonan]    and\n          Staples), as determined by Staples, which\n          determination shall be conclusive.\n\n(Emphasis added.)   The 2004 Stock-Option Agreement contained this\n\nlanguage, and added other grounds constituting \"cause,\" including\n\n\"violation by [Noonan] of the Code of Ethics or an attempt by\n\n\n\n\n                                -5-\n\f[Noonan] to secure any improper personal profit in connection with\n\nthe business of Staples.\"\n\n          Six days before being fired, Noonan sent Staples a\n\n$290,714.40 check and notified it that he was exercising his vested\n\nright to purchase 23,825 shares of stock -- 22,700 governed by the\n\n1992 Stock-Option Agreement, and 1,125 governed by the 2004 Stock-\n\nOption Agreement. Staples returned the check uncashed, noting that\n\nthe investigation into Noonan's expense-reporting practices was\n\nongoing, and that if Staples ultimately terminated him for cause,\n\nhe would not be entitled to gains on the shares.             Staples did not\n\nultimately allow Noonan to exercise the stock options.\n\n          Noonan also had a severance agreement with Staples which\n\nstated that Staples would not be required to pay benefits if Noonan\n\nwas terminated \"for '[c]ause'\" -- that is, if Noonan \"wilfully\n\nfail[ed] to substantially perform [his] duties with Staples,\"\n\n\"violate[d]   the   Code   of   Ethics    or   attempt[ed]   to   secure   any\n\nimproper personal profit,\" or \"engage[d] in misconduct which is\n\ndemonstrably and materially injurious to Staples . . . .\"           On these\n\ngrounds, Staples did not give Noonan severance benefits.\n\n          Noonan, a Florida resident, filed suit in Massachusetts\n\nstate court; Staples, a Massachusetts corporation, removed to the\n\nU.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.              Noonan's\n\ncomplaint alleged (1) libel based on the Baitler e-mail; (2) breach\n\nof the two stock-option agreements; and (3) breach of the severance\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\fagreement.1     Noonan moved for summary judgment on a portion of the\n\nlibel claim and on the claim alleging breach of the stock-option\n\nagreements; Staples filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on\n\nall counts in the complaint.      The district court granted summary\n\njudgment on behalf of Staples.        On the libel claim, the district\n\ncourt determined that what was stated in the e-mail was true, and\n\nthat Noonan had presented no evidence of actual malice on the part\n\nof Staples. On the breach-of-contract claims, the court found that\n\nNoonan had been fired for cause and that, pursuant to the terms of\n\nthe agreements, he was therefore ineligible for the stock options\n\nand benefits.     Noonan now appeals.\n\n                            II.   Discussion\n\n           A.    Standard of Review\n\n           We will affirm a district court's summary judgment where\n\n\"the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and\n\nany affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any\n\nmaterial fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a\n\nmatter of law.\"     Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(c).     At summary judgment, the\n\ncourt's task is not \"'to weigh the evidence and determine the truth\n\nof the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for\n\ntrial.'\"   Asociación de Periodistas de P.R. v. Mueller, 529 F.3d\n\n52, 55 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,\n\n\n\n1\n   Noonan made two other claims that were also dismissed by the\ndistrict court. He does not appeal those dismissals.\n\n                                   -7-\n\f477 U.S. 242, 250 (1986)).    We accord plenary review to summary\n\njudgment and view the record in the light most favorable to the\n\nnonmovant, drawing reasonable inferences in his favor. Franceschi,\n\n514 F.3d at 84.\n\n          B.   Libel Claim\n\n          Noonan claims first that Staples committed actionable\n\nlibel against him through the sending of the Baitler e-mail. Under\n\nMassachusetts law, a plaintiff alleging libel must ordinarily\n\nestablish five elements:     (1) that the defendant published a\n\nwritten statement; (2) of and concerning the plaintiff; that was\n\nboth (3) defamatory, and (4) false; and (5) either caused economic\n\nloss, or is actionable without proof of economic loss.2   Stanton v.\n\nMetro Corp., 438 F.3d 119, 124 (1st Cir. 2006) (citing White v.\n\nBlue Cross & Blue Shield of Mass., Inc., 809 N.E.2d 1034, 1036\n\n(Mass. 2004)); Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n,\n\n142 F.3d 26, 42 (1st Cir. 2006) (quoting McAvoy v. Shufrin, 518\n\nN.E.2d 513, 517 (Mass. 1988)).     A statement is defamatory if it\n\n\"may reasonably be read as discrediting [the plaintiff] in the\n\n\n2\n   The parties do not dispute that the first element of Noonan's\nlibel claim, which \"requires that the defendant communicate the\ndefamatory statement to a third party,\" White v. Blue Cross & Blue\nShield of Mass., Inc., 809 N.E.2d 1034, 1036 (Mass. 2004), was\nsatisfied by the sending of the Baitler e-mail to some 1,500\nStaples employees. The parties likewise do not dispute that the\ne-mail concerned the plaintiff, Noonan. Given our holding below\naffirming the district court's grant of summary judgment on\nNoonan's libel claim due to the absence of the fourth element, we\nneed not reach the question of whether the third and fifth elements\nare fulfilled on the record of this case.\n\n                                 -8-\n\fminds of any considerable and respectable class of the community.\"\n\nDisend v. Meadowbrook Sch., 604 N.E.2d 54, 55 (Mass. App. Ct. 1992)\n\n(citing Sharratt v. Housing Innovations, Inc., 310 N.E.2d 343, 346\n\n(Mass.   1974));   accord   White,   809   N.E.2d   at   1036.   With   the\n\nexception of statements that are true, Massachusetts courts will\n\nnot grant summary judgment for a libel defendant unless \"the\n\npublication is not reasonably capable of any defamatory meaning,\n\nand cannot reasonably be understood in any defamatory sense.\"\n\nSharratt, 310 N.E.2d at 345 (quoting King v. Ne. Pub'g Co.,\n\n2 N.E.2d 486, 487 (Mass. 1936)); see also Smith v. Suburban Rests.\n\nInc., 373 N.E.2d 215, 217 (Mass. 1978) (\"Inferences which might be\n\ndrawn by a considerable and respectable segment of the community\n\ncan make a publication actionable.\"); Amtrak Productions, Inc. v.\n\nMorton, 410 F.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir. 2005) (in determining whether\n\nstatement was defamatory, courts ask what a \"reasonable reader\"\n\nwould think upon reading it) (quoting Foley v. Lowell Sun Publ'g\n\nCo., 533 N.E.2d 196, 197 (Mass. 1989)).\n\n           Since a given statement, even if libelous, must also be\n\nfalse to give rise to a cause of action, the defendant may assert\n\nthe statement's truth as an absolute defense to a libel claim.\n\nMass. Sch. of Law at Andover, 142 F.3d at 42 (citing Bander v.\n\nMetro. Life Ins. Co., 47 N.E.2d 595, 598 (Mass. 1943)); McAvoy, 518\n\nN.E.2d at 517.     Massachusetts law, however, recognizes a narrow\n\nexception to this defense:     the truth or falsity of the statement\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fis immaterial, and the libel action may proceed, if the plaintiff\n\ncan   show    that   the   defendant   acted    with   \"actual    malice\"   in\n\npublishing the statement.       White, 809 N.E.2d at 1036 n.4 (citing\n\nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 92).\n\n             Noonan argued before the district court, and reiterates\n\nbefore us, that Baitler's e-mail was both defamatory and false, and\n\nthus constituted actionable libel.             Staples countered that the\n\nevidence clearly established that Noonan did indeed violate the\n\ncompany's travel and expense policy, and that the e-mail was\n\nconsequently true and no libel action could lie.                 The district\n\ncourt sided with Staples, concluding that Noonan's libel claim\n\ncould not proceed as a matter of law because the Baitler e-mail was\n\ntrue:   even when viewed in the light most favorable to Noonan, the\n\nrecord demonstrates that he failed to comply with the policy.               Our\n\nreview of the record and Massachusetts law leads us to the same\n\nconclusion.      Thus, there is no triable issue of fact on the\n\nquestion of truth.\n\n             We focus first on Noonan's arguments concerning the\n\ne-mail's falsity, because if the evidence corroborates Staples's\n\nasserted defense that the e-mail's contents were true, then absent\n\nactual malice on the part of Staples, the libel claim must be\n\ndismissed regardless of whether the e-mail defamed Noonan. See id.\n\nat 1036.     Noonan does not seriously challenge that, on their face,\n\nall the sentences in the e-mail were true.             As the e-mail states\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\fand   the    record      bears   out,   Staples   did    indeed    commission      an\n\ninvestigation of Noonan's expense-reporting practices, and the\n\ninvestigators determined that he was not in compliance with the\n\ntravel and expense policy.          Even Noonan admits that he frequently\n\ndisregarded the letter of the policy, booking travel with non-\n\ncompany travel agents, using his personal credit card instead of\n\nthe company card, and failing to turn in receipts.                      Whether, as\n\nNoonan asserts, he actually saved Staples money -- through, for\n\nexample,     buying      cheaper   plane   tickets      from   online    agents    or\n\ncommitting mathematical or typographical errors on his expense\n\nreports in Staples's favor -- is immaterial.3                  Whether, as Noonan\n\nasserts, many other traveling employees also regularly disregarded\n\nthe policy is likewise irrelevant. Even taking these assertions as\n\naccurate, they do not change the simple fact relayed in the e-mail,\n\nand supported by the evidence in the record, that Staples fired\n\nNoonan      after   an    investigation    determined      him    to    be   out   of\n\ncompliance with the travel and expense policy.\n\n              Noonan urges us, however, to look beyond the letter of\n\nthe e-mail to the effect it must have had on its approximately\n\n1,500 recipients.         He argues that reasonable recipients could have\n\nread other passages in the e-mail and, viewing the e-mail in its\n\n\n\n3\n    For this reason, we need not attempt to determine whose\ncalculations -- Noonan's or Staples's -- were correct, or whether\nit was Noonan or Staples who received the ultimate windfall from\nNoonan's typographical and mathematical errors.\n\n                                        -11-\n\ftotality, drawn the inference that he arrogantly regarded Staples's\n\npolicies as subject to his personal whim and committed some sort of\n\ngrave misconduct -- grave enough that Baitler himself departed from\n\ncompany policy on employee privacy by referring to Noonan by name\n\nin the e-mail. Indeed, according to Noonan, the e-mail's reference\n\nto an \"investigation,\" the recent experience with the firing and\n\nlater indictment of Dorman for stealing money from the company, and\n\nthe fact that Staples took the drastic step of terminating Noonan\n\ninstead   of   merely   reprimanding       him    or   delaying    the   relevant\n\nreimbursements, could have led reasonable readers to conclude that\n\nhe, like Dorman, committed a crime.               At the very least, the e-\n\nmail's reference to the company Code of Ethics could have given\n\nreasonable readers the impression that Noonan was terminated for\n\nillegal   or   unethical   conduct    in    the    reporting      of   his   travel\n\nexpenses. As support for these arguments, Noonan cites a number of\n\ncases applying Massachusetts law and holding that, to determine\n\nwhether a given statement is defamatory, the court must look at it\n\nas a whole and in the context in which it was published.                      See,\n\ne.g., Stanton, 438 F.3d at 125, 128; Foley, 533 N.E.2d at 197\n\n(court must examine statement \"'in its totality in the context in\n\nwhich it was uttered or published[,] . . . consider[ing] all the\n\nwords used, not merely a particular phrase or sentence'\" (quoting\n\nMyers v. Boston Magazine Co., 403 N.E.2d 376, 379 (Mass. 1980));\n\nSmith, 373 N.E.2d at 218; Sharrat, 310 N.E.2d at 346 (\"attendant\n\n\n                                     -12-\n\fcircumstances may be shown as proof of the defamatory nature of the\n\nwords\");   Disend,   604   N.E.2d    at    55   (\"Words    not     inherently\n\ndisparaging may . . . have that effect if viewed contextually,\n\ni.e., in the light of attendant circumstances.\" (citing Sharratt,\n\n310 N.E.2d at 346)).\n\n           Crucially, all of Noonan's cited cases concern how a\n\ncourt   determines   whether   a   given   statement   is,    or    could   be\n\nunderstood as, defamatory,4 and not with the separate inquiry of\n\nwhether the statement is true or false.            As noted above, the\n\nimpugned statement must be both defamatory and false for a libel\n\naction to lie, and these are distinct elements.           Without saying so\n\nexplicitly, Noonan is, in essence, asking us to import the corpus\n\nof legal principles for determining a statement's defamatory nature\n\ninto the examination of the statement's truth or falsity.             Noonan\n\nwants us to adopt a rule whereby even an objectively true statement\n\ncan give rise to a libel claim if reasonable readers might infer\n\nfrom it other, untrue characteristics of the plaintiff or conduct\n\nby him.\n\n\n\n\n4\n     Massachusetts courts engage in a similar inquiry when\ndetermining the second element of a libel claim -- whether the\nstatement is of or concerning the plaintiff. See, e.g., Stanton,\n438 F.3d at 128 (\"Like the question of whether a communication can\nreasonably be understood to be defamatory, whether a communication\ncan reasonably be understood to be of and concerning the plaintiff\ndepends on the circumstances.\" (citing New Eng. Tractor-Trailer of\nConn., Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co., 480 N.E.2d 1005, 1010 n.5\n(Mass. 1985)).\n\n                                    -13-\n\f             Unfortunately for Noonan, our survey of the relevant\n\nMassachusetts     law   has    uncovered     no   clear   support     for    this\n\ninterpretation,     and   we    are   reluctant     to    recognize    such     a\n\nsignificant expansion in view of our limited role as a federal\n\ncourt sitting under our diversity jurisdiction.                 See Gill v.\n\nGulfstream Park Racing Ass'n, Inc., 399 F.3d 391, 402 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (\"A federal court sitting in diversity cannot be expected to\n\ncreate new doctrines expanding state law.\"); A. Johnson & Co., Inc.\n\nv. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 933 F.2d 66, 73 n.10 (1st Cir. 1991)\n\n(diversity plaintiff \"cannot expect this court 'to torture state\n\nlaw into strange configurations or precipitously to blaze new and\n\nunprecedented    jurisprudential      trails'\"    (quoting   Kotler     v.    Am.\n\nTobacco Co., 926 F.2d 1217, 1224 (1st Cir. 1990))).             Instead, the\n\nrelevant Massachusetts cases reveal the truth-or-falsity inquiry to\n\nbe a much simpler one.        Our review of the record in the light most\n\nfavorable to Noonan reveals no triable issue of fact because, as\n\nStaples asserts, everything said in the e-mail was true -- or at\n\nleast substantially true -- and substantial truth is all that is\n\nrequired.5    See Murphy v. Boston Herald, Inc., 865 N.E.2d 746, 754\n\n(Mass. 2007); Jones v. Taibbi, 512 N.E.2d 260, 266 (Mass. 1987).6\n\n\n5\n   Thus, even though Noonan may dispute whether the investigation\nwas, as the Baitler e-mail characterized it, \"thorough,\" this minor\ndetail does not deprive the e-mail of its substantially true\ncharacter.\n6\n  To the extent the brief discussion in Perry v. Hearst Corp., 334\nF.2d 800, 801-02 (1st Cir. 1964), suggests a different outcome, we\n\n                                      -14-\n\f            Given this holding, Noonan's only hope for keeping his\n\nlibel claim alive is to prove that Staples -- or other employees\n\nresponsible for composing and sending the e-mail -- acted with\n\nactual malice.    As noted above, under Massachusetts law, even a\n\ntrue statement can form the basis of a libel action if the\n\nplaintiff proves that the defendant acted with actual malice.\n\nWhite, 809 N.E.2d at 1036 n.4 (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231,\n\n§ 92); Conroy v. Fall River Herald News Pub. Co., 28 N.E.2d 729,\n\n731-32 (Mass. 1940).\n\n            Noonan mounts a two-pronged argument for why a jury could\n\nconclude that Staples published the e-mail with actual malice.\n\nFirst, he alleges that Baitler harbored ill-will toward him and\n\nwished to cause him harm.     In his twelve years with the company,\n\nBaitler had never before referred to a fired employee by name in an\n\ne-mail or other mass communication, and in his deposition he had\n\ndifficulty explaining why it was necessary to mention Noonan by\n\nname; thus, Noonan avers, \"the language of the libel itself [could]\n\nbe found as a fact to breathe malevolence.\"           Hubbard v. Allyn, 86\n\nN.E. 356, 359 (Mass. 1908).     As additional evidence of Baitler's\n\nill-will,   Noonan   points   out    that   Baitler    had   been   Dorman's\n\nsupervisor and had failed to notice the latter's theft of money\n\nfrom the company; Noonan argues that a jury could infer from the\n\n\n\ndo not believe that such an outcome comports with Massachusetts law\nas it stands today.\n\n                                    -15-\n\frecord that Baitler pilloried him to detract attention away from\n\nthe Dorman scandal and Baitler's embarrassing role in it.\n\n           Second,     Noonan   claims       that   the   e-mail's   excessive\n\npublication is evidence of Baitler's, and thus Staples's, actual\n\nmalice.   Baitler had the e-mail sent to all 1,500 or so employees\n\nin the North American Division by including in the e-mail's \"To\"\n\nfield a group recipient called \"Contract Remote.\"              Noonan alleges\n\nthat someone at Staples then deleted the original electronic\n\nversion of the e-mail despite Noonan's lawyer's written request,\n\nand Staples's in-house counsel's subsequent instructions to the\n\nrelevant managers and employees, that it not be deleted.              Because\n\nemployees are constantly being added to and taken off the Contract\n\nRemote list, this deletion made it impossible to determine exactly\n\nwho was on the list, how many people the list included, and whether\n\nthe e-mail's recipients then forwarded it to additional persons\n\noutside the North American Division or outside the company. Noonan\n\ncontends that the e-mail's deletion raises a permissible inference\n\nthat the destroyed evidence must have been unfavorable to Staples,\n\nsee, e.g., Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l, Inc., 81 F.3d 1148, 1158-59\n\n(1st   Cir.    1996)   --   namely,    that     the   e-mail   was   published\n\nexcessively.\n\n           Neither of these arguments withstands close scrutiny. As\n\nfor Noonan's first argument -- that Baitler harbored ill-will\n\ntoward him and thus acted with actual malice -- Noonan has provided\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fus with an incorrect and outdated rendition of Massachusetts law.7\n\nThe Supreme Judicial Court has clearly stated that actual malice in\n\nthe defamation context \"does not mean the defendant's dislike of,\n\nhatred of, or ill will toward, the plaintiff.\"        Rotkiewicz v.\n\nSadowsky, 730 N.E.2d 282, 289 (Mass. 2000). Instead, the plaintiff\n\nestablishes actual malice by proving that the defendant knew the\n\nallegedly libelous statement was false when it was published, or\n\nthat the defendant acted with \"reckless disregard\" for whether it\n\nwas true or false -- that is, the defendant \"entertained serious\n\ndoubts\" as to its truth or falsity.    McAvoy, 518 N.E.2d at 517-18\n\n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted); accord Murphy, 865\n\nN.E.2d at 752; see also Rotkiewicz, 730 N.E.2d at 289 (\"The inquiry\n\nis a subjective one as to the defendant's attitude toward the truth\n\nor falsity of the statement rather than the defendant's attitude\n\ntoward the plaintiff.\" (citing Cantrell v. Forest City Publ'g Co.,\n\n419 U.S. 245, 252 (1974))).\n\n            Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Noonan\n\nand considering this standard, there is no evidence of actual\n\nmalice on the part of Baitler or any other relevant Staples\n\nemployee.   It was reasonable for Baitler to rely on the findings of\n\nthe experienced team of investigators that Staples put together for\n\n\n7\n  Older Massachusetts law, cited by Noonan, defined actual malice\nfor a libel claim in the more traditional sense of hatred or ill-\nwill. See, e.g., Fay v. Harrington, 57 N.E. 369, 371 (Mass. 1900).\nThis law has been superseded by the modern definition. See Richard\nW. Bishop, 17A Mass. Practice § 43.6 n.5.\n\n                                -17-\n\fthe purpose of auditing Noonan's expense reports.                There is simply\n\nnothing in the record to suggest that Baitler or another relevant\n\nemployee believed Noonan not to have contravened the travel and\n\nexpense    policy,   or   that    they     sent   the   e-mail    with    reckless\n\ndisregard for whether Noonan contravened the policy.                     Moreover,\n\nsince actual malice in Massachusetts does not equate to hatred or\n\nill-will, Rotkiewicz, 730 N.E.2d at 289, Baitler's own personal\n\nfeelings toward Noonan are inconsequential, and we need not state\n\na view on -- or remand for a jury to determine -- whether Baitler\n\ndid indeed dislike Noonan or wish to sabotage his good reputation.\n\n            As for Noonan's second argument -- that the e-mail's\n\nexcessive publication evinces Staples's actual malice -- under\n\nMassachusetts law excessive publication has been interpreted not as\n\na manifestation of actual malice, but as something different.                 The\n\nquestion of excessive publication routinely comes up in the context\n\nof determining whether a defendant has abused its conditional\n\nprivilege to publish defamatory material. The Massachusetts courts\n\nconsistently speak of two ways in which the defendant may lose such\n\na privilege:      through actual (sometimes called \"express\") malice\n\nor,   as   an   alternative,     through    unnecessary,    unreasonable,      or\n\nexcessive publication.         See, e.g., Galvin v. N.Y., New Haven &\n\nHartford R.R. Co., 168 N.E.2d 262, 266 (Mass. 1960) (\"We think the\n\ntime has now come to recognize that there can be an abuse of a\n\nconditional privilege by conduct which cannot fairly be classed as\n\n\n                                     -18-\n\fexpress   or   actual   malice.\");    see   also    Petition   of   Retailers\n\nCommercial Agency, Inc., 174 N.E.2d 376, 379-80 (Mass. 1961)\n\n(noting the lack of evidence of actual or express malice, but\n\nstating that the qualified privilege may be lost nonetheless\n\nthrough   unnecessary,    unreasonable,     or     excessive   publication);\n\naccord Mulgrew v. City of Taunton, 574 N.E.2d 389, 391 (Mass.\n\n1991); Bratt v. Int'l Bus. Machs., Inc., 467 N.E.2d 126, 131 (Mass.\n\n1984).    Thus, even if the record showed that Staples published the\n\ne-mail excessively, this would not constitute actual malice under\n\nMassachusetts law and render the alleged libel actionable despite\n\nits truth.8\n\n            For these reasons, the record viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to Noonan leads us to conclude that the e-mail is\n\nsubstantially true, that Staples did not act with actual malice and\n\nthus did not forfeit its defense of truth, and that no triable\n\nissue of material fact therefore remains on Noonan's libel claim.9\n\nWe accordingly affirm the district court's summary judgment in\n\n\n\n8\n   The possibility that Staples may have destroyed the electronic\nversion of the e-mail notwithstanding requests to preserve it does\nnot compel a contrary result. This is so because the actual malice\ninquiry turns on the defendant's state of mind at the time it\npublished the alleged libel, and it is undisputed that the Baitler\ne-mail's possible destruction took place several days after its\npublication.\n9\n   Because we conclude that no actionable libel was published in\nthe first place, we need not reach the question of whether Staples\nnonetheless retained its conditional privilege -- a point argued at\nlength by both parties.\n\n                                     -19-\n\ffavor of Staples on the libel claim, and move on to Noonan's claim\n\nthat Staples breached its stock-option agreements with him.\n\n           C.     Breach of Stock-Option Agreements\n\n           Noonan next argues that the district court erred in\n\ngranting summary judgment to Staples on his claim that the latter\n\nbreached the two stock-option agreements by not allowing him to\n\nexercise his options. The district court noted the language in the\n\nagreements providing that Noonan was ineligible for the stock\n\noptions if Staples determined that his termination was \"for cause,\"\n\nand   dismissed    the   claim   because   \"Staples's   classification   of\n\n[Noonan's] actions as willful misconduct appears reasonable and\n\napplicable in the circumstances.\"\n\n           As an initial matter, we must ascertain the correct\n\nrubric through which to evaluate Noonan's assertion that he did\n\nnot, in fact, engage in willful misconduct or any other activity\n\nthat would qualify as cause for his firing.        Staples contends that\n\nwe are prohibited from reaching the merits of this question, as the\n\nstock-option agreements entrust the decision on what constitutes\n\n\"cause\" to Staples, and Staples alone.           It argues that several\n\ncourts have held similar clauses to be a valid limitation on\n\ncontractual remedies.        See, e.g., McIntyre v. Phila. Suburban\n\nCorp., 90 F. Supp. 2d 596, 600 (E.D. Pa. 2000); Stemerman v.\n\nAckerman, 184 A.2d 28, 33 (Del. Ch. 1962).          Noonan, by contrast,\n\nurges us to declare the relevant clauses in the agreements invalid\n\n\n                                    -20-\n\fbecause they violate public policy, because they allow Staples to\n\nbe the judge in its own case.           See, e.g., Ellis v. Emhart Mfg. Co.,\n\n191 A.2d 546, 549 (Conn. 1963) (clause in stock-option agreement\n\nviolated public policy by providing that board of directors'\n\ninterpretation was final and conclusive) (citing, inter alia,\n\nPatton v. Babson's Statistical Org., Inc., 156 N.E. 534, 536 (Mass.\n\n1927)).    Noonan invites us instead to engage in de novo review of\n\nwhether there was cause to fire him.                For the reasons explained\n\nbelow, the weight of authority pushes us onto a middle course\n\nbetween these two extremes.\n\n            The     question      we    must    answer    is   whether     Staples's\n\ncontractual prerogative to determine what constitutes \"cause\" is\n\nunreviewable.      If so, the matter ends there and we need not look at\n\nthe evidence to determine whether cause did indeed exist for firing\n\nNoonan,    because    Staples      undisputably     determined      that       it    did.\n\nUnlike    the    inquiry   into    an    alleged    libel's      truth    or    falsity\n\ndiscussed above -- which Massachusetts courts have addressed -- our\n\nsurvey of Massachusetts law reveals no pronouncement by that\n\nstate's courts on this precise question.                 Since this case rests on\n\ndiversity       jurisdiction,      we    must    attempt    to    divine       how   the\n\nMassachusetts courts, and in particular the Supreme Judicial Court,\n\nwould answer the question if faced squarely with it.                     See Hardy v.\n\nLoon Mt. Recreation Corp., 276 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir. 2002); accord\n\nLiberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 260 F.3d 54, 65\n\n\n                                         -21-\n\f(1st Cir. 2001) (\"Absent a decision by the state's highest court,\n\nwe are free to make our own best guess as to Massachusetts law . .\n\n. .\").      In coming up with our \"best guess,\" we may look to\n\nanalogous decisions from other jurisdictions.            Hardy, 276 F.3d at\n\n20 (citing Stratford Sch. Dist., S.A.U. #58 v. Employers Reins.\n\nCorp., 162 F.3d 718, 720 (1st Cir. 1998)); see also Vigortone AG\n\nProds., Inc. v. PM AG Prods., Inc., 316 F.3d 641, 644 (7th Cir.\n\n2002) (explaining that \"the best guess is that the state's highest\n\ncourt, should it ever be presented with the issues, will line up\n\nwith the majority of the states\").           We may also find guidance in\n\npronouncements on similar matters by Massachusetts courts.\n\n            Staples points us to what is probably the most closely\n\nanalogous published case of the handful that exist dealing with\n\nthis question, Weir v. Anaconda Co., 773 F.2d 1073 (10th Cir.\n\n1985).     In that case, Weir and his former employer, the Anaconda\n\nCompany,     had   a   stock-option     plan     which   gave   an    Anaconda\n\ncompensation committee the sole authority to determine whether Weir\n\nhad been fired for cause, and was thereby precluded from exercising\n\na stock option.        Contrary to Staples's suggestion, however, the\n\nTenth Circuit did not hold that the compensation committee's cause\n\ndecision was unreviewable.       Id. at 1078.        Instead, according to\n\nthat court's reading of the applicable Kansas law, the committee's\n\ndecision should be treated in a manner similar to an agency\n\ndecision,    and   thus    reviewed    for     whether   it   was    arbitrary,\n\n\n                                      -22-\n\ffraudulent,        or    made    in     bad   faith.      Id.    at    1078-79.     After\n\nevaluating the evidence relating to Weir's firing in the light most\n\nfavorable to him, the court concluded that the committee's decision\n\nsuffered from none of these defects, and affirmed summary judgment\n\nin favor of Anaconda.             See id. at 1081-83.           Importantly, the court\n\nexpressly rejected Weir's request that it apply, as Noonan implores\n\nus   to    do    here,    a     fully    de   novo     standard    of    review    to    the\n\ncommittee's decision.             Id. at 1078.\n\n                Our survey of other jurisdictions has uncovered several\n\ncases adopting similar standards of review. See, e.g., Scribner v.\n\nWorldcom,       Inc.,     249    F.3d    902,   909    (9th     Cir.    2001)   (applying\n\nWashington         law,         court     reviews       stock-option        committee's\n\ninterpretation of plan's terms to determine whether it was made in\n\ngood faith); Craig v. Pillsbury Non-Qualified Pension Plan, 458\n\nF.3d 748, 752 (8th Cir. 2006) (similar); W.R. Berkley Corp. v.\n\nHall, No. Civ.A. 03C-12-146WCC, 2005 WL 406348, at *4 (Del. Super.\n\nCt. Feb. 16, 2005) (unpublished) (when stock-option committee is\n\nvested with final authority to determine rights under plan, court\n\nwill not second-guess its decision absent showing of fraud or bad\n\nfaith); Schwartz v. Century Circuit, Inc., 163 A.2d 793, 796 (Del.\n\nCh. 1960) (similar).             These standards, and that propounded by the\n\nWeir      court,    comport       with    the   standard        consistently      used    by\n\nMassachusetts courts for determining whether a government official\n\nacted properly in discharging another government employee.                              See,\n\n\n                                              -23-\n\fe.g., Flomenbaum v. Commonwealth, 889 N.E.2d 423, 429 (Mass. 2008)\n\n(arbitrary or capricious); Levy v. Acting Governor, 767 N.E.2d 66,\n\n79 (Mass. 2002); McSweeney v. Town Manager of Lexington, 401 N.E.2d\n\n113, 117 (Mass. 1980); cf., e.g., Madera v. Marsh USA, Inc., 426\n\nF.3d 56, 63-64 (1st Cir. 2005) (where ERISA benefits plan gives\n\nplan   administrator   or   fiduciary   discretionary   authority   to\n\ndetermine employee's eligibility for benefits, the determination is\n\nsubject to an arbitrary and capricious standard of review, and the\n\ndecision must be upheld \"'if there is any reasonable basis for it'\"\n\n(quoting Brigham v. Sun Life of Can., 317 F.3d 72, 81 (1st Cir.\n\n2003)).\n\n          In view of this authority, our best prediction is that\n\nthe Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court would hold that Staples's\n\n\"for cause\" decision is not unreviewable, nor reviewable de novo,10\n\nbut instead that the courts may perform a limited review of the\n\ndecision to determine if it was arbitrary, capricious, or made in\n\n\n\n10\n   Noonan claims that we are bound by the Patton case, in which the\nSupreme Judicial Court held invalid a contractual clause giving a\ncompany president the sole authority to determine whether a fired\nemployee would receive a deferred salary. See Patton, 156 N.E. at\n536.   Yet Massachusetts courts strongly favor the freedom of\ncontract absent serious misconduct or fraud.      See, e.g., Sound\nTechniques, Inc. v. Hoffman, 737 N.E.2d 920, 927 (Mass. App. Ct.\n2000).    There is no evidence in the record that Noonan, a\nsophisticated party, was under duress when he signed onto the\nstock-option agreements, or that the agreements suffered from some\nother infirmity invalidating their plain terms.      In any event,\nPatton dates from 1927, and we do not think the Court would take\nthe same view today when faced with a modern stock-option agreement\nlike the two at issue here.\n\n                                 -24-\n\fbad faith.11    Even if we might disagree with Staples's action\n\nregarding Noonan's firing, if Staples's decision was not arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or made in bad faith, then we must accord it deference,\n\nand consequently affirm the denial of Noonan's stock options under\n\nthe plain terms of the agreements.           Cf., e.g., Mesnick v. Gen.\n\nElec. Co., 950 F.2d 816, 825 (1st Cir. 1991) (courts are not \"super\n\npersonnel departments,\" and should not ordinarily second-guess\n\nemployers' business decisions).       In performing this portion of the\n\ninquiry, we adopt the definition of \"cause\" common to both stock-\n\noption agreements -- willful misconduct or willful failure to\n\nperform responsibilities in the best interests of Staples -- a\n\ndefinition   which   Noonan   seems   to    accept   as   applicable   here.\n\nCf. DiPietro v. Sipex Corp., 865 N.E.2d 1190, 1194 n.3 (Mass. App.\n\nCt. 2007) (applying definition of \"for cause\" as set forth in the\n\nrelevant agreement).\n\n           Noonan argues that, while he undoubtedly committed a\n\nnumber of errors on the expense reports audited by Staples's\n\ninvestigation team, these were merely the result of inadvertence or\n\ncarelessness, and not a willful attempt to defraud Staples. At the\n\nvery least, Noonan contends, the determination of whether his\n\nconduct was willful involves looking into his state of mind, a\n\nquestion   ordinarily   reserved   for     the   jury.    See   Maimaron   v.\n\n\n11\n   At another point in its brief, Staples concedes that its cause\ndecision must have been made in good faith, and that we have the\nauthority to review the decision at least to that extent.\n\n                                   -25-\n\fCommonwealth, 865 N.E.2d 1098, 1109 (Mass. 2007).                 Again, however,\n\nour task here -- and the jury's, if this case were to survive\n\nsummary judgment -- is not to determine whether Noonan did indeed\n\nact willfully, but whether Staples's assessment that he acted\n\nwillfully     was   arbitrary,    capricious,        or   made    in    bad   faith.\n\nNotwithstanding a viewing of the evidence in Noonan's favor, we\n\nhold that there is no material fact in dispute on this issue.\n\n              Noonan does not dispute that the team of investigators\n\nwas competent and experienced.           The team looked at not just one or\n\ntwo of his expense reports, but at thirty-seven, spread across\n\n2005.    It uncovered dozens of instances in which Noonan claimed\n\nmore than he was entitled to and determined unanimously that the\n\ndiscrepancies must have been intentional. Our review of the record\n\nreveals no material dispute of this fact.                 Even if, in fact, the\n\ndozens   of    discrepancies     were    all   the   result      of    some   extreme\n\nsloppiness or inattentiveness on Noonan's part (as he rather\n\nunblushingly contends), we discern no triable issue of fact on\n\nwhether the team -- and the Staples officers who reviewed and acted\n\nupon the team's findings -- had a good-faith basis for concluding\n\nthat Noonan deliberately doctored these entries. For example, even\n\ntaking Noonan's $1,100 Big Mac as an honest keypadding slip (as\n\nNoonan claims it was), the several entries showing the item claimed\n\nas exactly $100 more than it actually cost are extremely damaging\n\nto Noonan's case.     The record reveals that the team found these to\n\n\n                                        -26-\n\frefute his claim that the discrepancies were merely instances in\n\nwhich he pre-populated the expense report (that is, he guessed at\n\nhow much the item would cost) and simply forgot to go back and\n\ncorrect the entry later after he bought it and knew how much it\n\nactually cost.   Also damaging to Noonan's case, and taken into\n\naccount by the team, was his failure to notice (and his inability\n\nto explain this failure to the investigators) the large amounts of\n\nextra money being deposited into his account as a result of his\n\nover-reimbursements.12\n\n          Therefore, regardless of whether Noonan also made errors\n\nthat, in the end, resulted in an ultimate windfall for Staples,13\n\nthe evidence viewed in Noonan's favor still shows highly suspicious\n\nexpense-reporting practices sufficient to ground a finding that\n\nNoonan intentionally manipulated at least some expense reports so\n\nthat he would receive money he did not deserve.          As Noonan\n\nrepeatedly argues or intimates, Staples may have been wiser to\n\nconduct yet another, even more searching investigation into his\n\n\n\n12\n   Another relevant factor is that Staples's termination letter to\nNoonan told him that he was being fired for cause. See Hammond v.\nT.J. Litle & Co., 82 F.3d 1166, 1175 (1st Cir. 1996) (applying\nMassachusetts law and remarking that \"when an employee may only be\nterminated for cause, whether the employer so informs the employee\nplays a decisive role in a court's later determination of whether\nthe employee was discharged for cause\").\n13\n    As noted above, the parties vigorously dispute which party\nreceived the ultimate windfall.    We need not determine who is\ncorrect on this question in order to resolve the issues presented\nin this appeal. See supra note 3.\n\n                               -27-\n\fconduct; to give him a second chance before firing him; to impose\n\nsome less-severe form of discipline; or to punish other violators\n\nin the North American Division -- of whom Noonan claims there were\n\nmany -- with the same harsh penalty.   Nevertheless, even indulging\n\nNoonan all reasonable inferences, we cannot say that Staples's\n\ndecision that Noonan engaged in willful misconduct or willfully\n\nfailed to perform his duties in its best interest -- based as it\n\nwas on the findings of experienced auditors -- was arbitrary,\n\ncapricious, or made in bad faith.\n\n          For these reasons, there is no triable issue of material\n\nfact with respect to Staples's decision that cause existed to fire\n\nNoonan, and under the plain terms of the stock-option agreements,\n\nStaples was thus entitled to determine Noonan ineligible for the\n\nstock options.   Accordingly, the district court did not err in\n\ngranting summary judgment to Staples on Noonan's claims concerning\n\nthe stock-option agreements, and we move on to his last ground of\n\nappeal.\n\n          D.   Breach of Severance Agreement\n\n          Lastly, Noonan contends that the district court erred in\n\ngranting summary judgment to Staples on his claim that it violated\n\nthe severance agreement.   We need not dwell long on this ground of\n\nappeal because it is foreclosed by the plain terms of the relevant\n\ninstruments.   The severance agreement provided that Noonan would\n\nnot receive his severance benefits if Staples terminated him \"for\n\n\n                               -28-\n\f'[c]ause.'\" Another clause in the agreement provided that \"cause,\"\n\nfor purposes of the severance agreement, includes a violation of\n\nStaples's Code of Ethics.      The Code of Ethics, in turn, contained\n\nthe following provision:\n\n           We expect you to keep accurate records and\n           reports . . . . All company books, records,\n           and accounts must be maintained in accordance\n           with all applicable regulations and standards\n           and accurately reflect the transactions they\n           record. . . . We do not permit . . . false or\n           misleading entries in the company's books or\n           records for any reason. . . .\n\n           Even viewed in the light most favorable to Noonan, the\n\nevidence in the record readily shows that he failed to abide by\n\nthis clause of the Code of Ethics.14      As Staples suggests, even if\n\nall of Noonan's many expense-reporting discrepancies were simply\n\ncareless     mistakes   or   instances   where   he   forgot   to   amend\n\npre-populated entries after figuring out what the item actually\n\ncost, the mere fact that he deliberately created inaccurate entries\n\nthrough the practice of pre-population transgresses this provision.\n\nThus, under the plain terms of the severance agreement, Noonan was\n\nfired for cause, as that term is specifically defined in that\n\nagreement.    See, e.g., Cabot Corp. v. AVX Corp., 863 N.E.2d 503,\n\n513 (Mass. 2007) (where a contract's language is unambiguous, its\n\n\n\n14\n   The quoted language comes from the 2005 version of the Code of\nEthics.   Noonan seems to argue that he was bound by the 2001\nversion of the Code; Staples asserts that he was bound by the 2005\nversion.   We need not decide which party is correct, as the\nrelevant language in the 2001 version is identical.\n\n                                  -29-\n\finterpretation is a question of law that may be resolved on summary\n\njudgment); Eigerman v. Putnam Invs., Inc., 877 N.E.2d 1258, 1263\n\n(Mass. 2007) (courts interpret contracts according to plain terms\n\nwhere these are unambiguous).   The district court therefore acted\n\nproperly in determining that Noonan forfeited his entitlement to\n\nseverance benefits, and summary judgment in favor of Staples on\n\nthis claim also must stand.15\n\n                         III.   Conclusion\n\n          For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's\n\ngrant of summary judgment in favor of Staples in all respects.\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n15\n    We add that the 2004 Stock-Option Agreement (but not the 1992\nStock-Option Agreement) also included violation of the Code of\nEthics as a ground constituting \"cause.\" Summary judgment in favor\nof Staples with respect to that agreement could therefore have been\naffirmed for this reason as an alternative to the ground discussed\nabove.\n\n                                -30-\n\f",

Noonan was fired from his job as a salesman at Staples, Inc. for allegedly padding expense reports. A Staples executive then sent a mass e-mail to about 1,500 employees informing them that Noonan had been fired for violating the company's travel and expense policy. Staples also denied Noonan his severance benefits and refused to allow him to exercise his stock options, claiming that, under the terms of the agreements setting forth the right to these benefits, Noonan was ineligible because he had been fired \"for cause.\" Noonan sued Staples in Massachusetts court for libel and breach of those agreements, and Staples removed to federal court. Both parties moved for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Staples, and Noonan now appeals. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because this case comes to us on appeal from summary judgment, we relate the relevant facts in the light that most favors the nonmovant, Noonan. <i>Franceschi v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</i> 514 F.3d 81, 83 (1st Cir.2008). Noonan was a Staples sales director who did much traveling for business and had to compile expense reports to be reimbursed for travel, food, and other business-related expenses. Staples had a travel and expense policy requiring employees to submit receipts for all expenses over $75, and for all meals regardless of price; to use their corporate credit card for business expenses instead of their personal credit card; and to book all work-related travel through Staples's travel department. Noonan claims, with support in the record, that these directives were irregularly enforced and often not followed by many employees.</p>\n<p>In November 2005, Staples discovered that an employee named James Dorman had been embezzling money from the company through fraudulent expense claims and fired him. It then undertook an audit of expense reports based on a sample of sixty-five traveling employees in the North American Division, including Noonan. Auditors investigating Noonan discovered a May 2005 expense report in which he had requested $1,622 in excess of what he had actually spent. The team also found that Noonan had used his personal credit card for many of these purchases, had booked the travel through a non-company travel agent, and had failed to submit all the required receipts.</p>\n<p>These anomalies led Staples to assemble a special team, composed of certified accountants and a former police investigator, to look further into Noonan's past expense reports. Noonan admitted to the team that he often \"pre-populated\" his reports before a given tripthat is, he estimated what his expenses would be in advance, and submitted the report with these estimates, but with (Noonan claims) the intention to amend the report later to the extent the actual expenses differed from the estimates. The team found that Noonan had failed to enter such adjustments on a number of expense reports and discovered other anomalies, such as entries where the amount claimed was exactly $100 more than what the item actually cost, and entries where decimal points had been shifted two places to the right (resulting, for example, in an $1,129 meal at an airport McDonald's, instead of $11.29). Noonan also committed errors in Staples's favor. When the team asked him about the large amounts of extra money that had been deposited into his checking account, Noonan responded that he had not noticed.</p>\n<p>Based on its findings, the team unanimously concluded that Noonan had deliberately falsified the audited expense reports and, as a result, Staples fired him. It sent him a letter stating that he had been terminated \"for cause\" for violating the travel and expense policy and the company's Code of Ethics, and that he was consequently ineligible for severance benefits. The following day, Executive Vice-President Jay Baitler sent an e-mail to all the employees in Staples's North American Division, a group whose precise number is unknown and disputed, but that totaled somewhere around 1,500 people. The e-mail stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>It is with sincere regret that I must inform you of the termination of Alan Noonan's employment with Staples. A thorough investigation determined that Alan was not in compliance with our [travel and expenses] policies. As always, our policies are consistently applied to everyone and compliance is mandatory on everyone's part. It is incumbent on all managers to understand <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> Staples['s] policies and to consistently communicate, educate and monitor compliance every single day. Compliance with company policies is not subject to personal discretion and is not optional. In addition to ensuring compliance, the approver's responsibility to monitor and question is a critical factor in effective management of this and all policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If you have any questions about Staples['s] policies or Code of Ethics, call the Ethics Hotline . . . or ask your human resources manager.</blockquote>\n<p>Over the course of Noonan's employment, he and Staples entered into two stock-option agreements, dating respectively from 1992 and 2004 (respectively, the \"1992 Stock-Option Agreement\" and the \"2004 Stock-Option Agreement\"). The pertinent language in the 1992 Stock-Option Agreement provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[I]f [Noonan's] relationship with Staples is terminated by Staples for \"cause\" (as defined below) . . . the right to exercise this option with respect to any shares not previously exercised shall terminate immediately. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Cause\" shall mean willful misconduct by [Noonan] or willful failure to perform his or her responsibilities in the best interests of Staples (including, without limitation, breach by [Noonan] of any provision of any employment, consulting, advisory, nondisclosure, non-competition or other similar agreement between [Noonan] and Staples), <i>as determined by Staples,</i> which determination shall be conclusive.</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.) The 2004 Stock-Option Agreement contained this language, and added other grounds constituting \"cause,\" including \"violation by [Noonan] of the Code of Ethics or an attempt by [Noonan] to secure any improper personal profit in connection with the business of Staples.\"</p>\n<p>Six days before being fired, Noonan sent Staples a $290,714.40 check and notified it that he was exercising his vested right to purchase 23,825 shares of stock-22,700 governed by the 1992 Stock-Option Agreement, and 1,125 governed by the 2004 Stock-Option Agreement. Staples returned the check uncashed, noting that the investigation into Noonan's expense-reporting practices was ongoing, and that if Staples ultimately terminated him for cause, he would not be entitled to gains on the shares. Staples did not ultimately allow Noonan to exercise the stock options.</p>\n<p>Noonan also had a severance agreement with Staples which stated that Staples would not be required to pay benefits if Noonan was terminated \"for `[c]ause'\" that is, if Noonan \"wilfully fail[ed] to substantially perform [his] duties with Staples,\" \"violate[d] the Code of Ethics or attempt[ed] to secure any improper personal profit,\" or \"engage[d] in misconduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to Staples. . . .\" On these grounds, Staples did not give Noonan severance benefits.</p>\n<p>Noonan, a Florida resident, filed suit in Massachusetts state court; Staples, a Massachusetts corporation, removed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Noonan's complaint alleged (1) libel based on the Baitler e-mail; (2) breach of the two stock-option agreements; and (3) breach of the severance agreement.<sup>[1]</sup> Noonan moved for summary judgment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> on a portion of the libel claim and on the claim alleging breach of the stock-option agreements; Staples filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on all counts in the complaint. The district court granted summary judgment on behalf of Staples. On the libel claim, the district court determined that what was stated in the e-mail was true, and that Noonan had presented no evidence of actual malice on the part of Staples. On the breach-of-contract claims, the court found that Noonan had been fired for cause and that, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, he was therefore ineligible for the stock options and benefits. Noonan now appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We will affirm a district court's summary judgment where \"the pleadings, the discovery and disclosure materials on file, and any affidavits show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the movant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\" Fed.R.Civ.P. 56(c). At summary judgment, the court's task is not \"`to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter but to determine whether there is a genuine issue for trial.'\" <i>Asociación de Periodistas de P.R. v. Mueller,</i> 529 F.3d 52, 55 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc.,</i> 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986)). We accord plenary review to summary judgment and view the record in the light most favorable to the nonmovant, drawing reasonable inferences in his favor. <i>Franceschi,</i> 514 F.3d at 84.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Libel Claim</h2>\n<p>Noonan claims first that Staples committed actionable libel against him through the sending of the Baitler e-mail. Under Massachusetts law, a plaintiff alleging libel must ordinarily establish five elements: (1) that the defendant published a written statement; (2) of and concerning the plaintiff; that was both (3) defamatory, and (4) false; and (5) either caused economic loss, or is actionable without proof of economic loss.<sup>[2]</sup><i>Stanton v. Metro Corp.,</i> 438 F.3d 119, 124 (1st Cir.2006) (citing <i>White v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mass., Inc.,</i> 442 Mass. 64, 809 N.E.2d 1034, 1036 (2004)); <i>Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover, Inc. v. Am. Bar Ass'n,</i> 142 F.3d 26, 42 (1st Cir.2006) (quoting <i>McAvoy v. Shufrin,</i> 401 Mass. 593, 518 N.E.2d 513, 517 (1988)). A statement is defamatory if it \"may reasonably be read as discrediting [the plaintiff] in the minds of any considerable and respectable class of the community.\" <i>Disend v. Meadowbrook Sch.,</i> 33 Mass.App.Ct. 674, 604 N.E.2d 54, 55 (1992) (citing <i>Sharratt v. Housing Innovations, Inc.,</i> 365 Mass. 141, 310 N.E.2d 343, 346 (1974)); <i>accord </i><i>White,</i> 809 N.E.2d at 1036. With the exception of statements that are true, Massachusetts courts will not grant summary judgment for a libel defendant unless \"the publication is not reasonably capable of any defamatory meaning, and cannot reasonably be understood in any defamatory sense.\" <i>Sharratt,</i> 310 N.E.2d at 345 (quoting <i>King v. Ne. Pub'g Co.,</i> 294 <span class=\"star-pagination\">*6</span> Mass. 369, 2 N.E.2d 486, 487 (1936)); <i>see also </i><i>Smith v. Suburban Rests. Inc.,</i> 374 Mass. 528, 373 N.E.2d 215, 217 (1978) (\"Inferences which might be drawn by a considerable and respectable segment of the community can make a publication actionable.\"); <i>Amrak Productions, Inc. v. Morton,</i> 410 F.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir.2005) (in determining whether statement was defamatory, courts ask what a \"reasonable reader\" would think upon reading it) (quoting <i>Foley v. Lowell Sun Publ'g Co.,</i> 404 Mass. 9, 533 N.E.2d 196, 197 (1989)).</p>\n<p>Since a given statement, even if libelous, must also be false to give rise to a cause of action, the defendant may assert the statement's truth as an absolute defense to a libel claim. <i>Mass. Sch. of Law at Andover,</i> 142 F.3d at 42 (citing <i>Bander v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 313 Mass. 337, 47 N.E.2d 595, 598 (1943)); <i>McAvoy,</i> 518 N.E.2d at 517. Massachusetts law, however, recognizes a narrow exception to this defense: the truth or falsity of the statement is immaterial, and the libel action may proceed, if the plaintiff can show that the defendant acted with \"actual malice\" in publishing the statement. <i>White,</i> 809 N.E.2d at 1036 n. 4 (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 92).</p>\n<p>Noonan argued before the district court, and reiterates before us, that Baitler's e-mail was both defamatory and false, and thus constituted actionable libel. Staples countered that the evidence clearly established that Noonan did indeed violate the company's travel and expense policy, and that the e-mail was consequently true and no libel action could lie. The district court sided with Staples, concluding that Noonan's libel claim could not proceed as a matter of law because the Baitler e-mail was true: even when viewed in the light most favorable to Noonan, the record demonstrates that he failed to comply with the policy. Our review of the record and Massachusetts law leads us to the same conclusion. Thus, there is no triable issue of fact on the question of truth.</p>\n<p>We focus first on Noonan's arguments concerning the e-mail's falsity, because if the evidence corroborates Staples's asserted defense that the e-mail's contents were true, then absent actual malice on the part of Staples, the libel claim must be dismissed regardless of whether the e-mail defamed Noonan. <i>See id.</i> at 1036. Noonan does not seriously challenge that, on their face, all the sentences in the e-mail were true. As the e-mail states and the record bears out, Staples did indeed commission an investigation of Noonan's expense-reporting practices, and the investigators determined that he was not in compliance with the travel and expense policy. Even Noonan admits that he frequently disregarded the letter of the policy, booking travel with non-company travel agents, using his personal credit card instead of the company card, and failing to turn in receipts. Whether, as Noonan asserts, he actually saved Staples money-through, for example, buying cheaper plane tickets from online agents or committing mathematical or typographical errors on his expense reports in Staples's favor-is immaterial.<sup>[3]</sup> Whether, as Noonan asserts, many other traveling employees also regularly disregarded the policy is likewise irrelevant. Even taking these assertions as accurate, they do not change the simple fact relayed in the e-mail, and supported by the evidence in the record, that Staples fired Noonan after an investigation determined him to be out of compliance with the travel and expense policy.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> Noonan urges us, however, to look beyond the letter of the e-mail to the effect it must have had on its approximately 1,500 recipients. He argues that reasonable recipients could have read other passages in the e-mail and, viewing the e-mail in its totality, drawn the inference that he arrogantly regarded Staples's policies as subject to his personal whim and committed some sort of grave misconductgrave enough that Baitler himself departed from company policy on employee privacy by referring to Noonan by name in the e-mail. Indeed, according to Noonan, the e-mail's reference to an \"investigation,\" the recent experience with the firing and later indictment of Dorman for stealing money from the company, and the fact that Staples took the drastic step of terminating Noonan instead of merely reprimanding him or delaying the relevant reimbursements, could have led reasonable readers to conclude that he, like Dorman, committed a crime. At the very least, the e-mail's reference to the company Code of Ethics could have given reasonable readers the impression that Noonan was terminated for illegal or unethical conduct in the reporting of his travel expenses. As support for these arguments, Noonan cites a number of cases applying Massachusetts law and holding that, to determine whether a given statement is defamatory, the court must look at it as a whole and in the context in which it was published. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Stanton,</i> 438 F.3d at 125, 128; <i>Foley,</i> 533 N.E.2d at 197 (court must examine statement \"`in its totality in the context in which it was uttered or published[,] . . . consider[ing] all the words used, not merely a particular phrase or sentence'\") (quoting <i>Myers v. Boston Magazine Co.,</i> 380 Mass. 336, 403 N.E.2d 376, 379 (1980)); <i>Smith,</i> 373 N.E.2d at 218; <i>Sharratt,</i> 310 N.E.2d at 346 (\"attendant circumstances may be shown as proof of the defamatory nature of the words\"); <i>Disend,</i> 604 N.E.2d at 55 (\"Words not inherently disparaging may . . . have that effect if viewed contextually, i.e., in the light of attendant circumstances.\" (citing <i>Sharratt,</i> 310 N.E.2d at 346)).</p>\n<p>Crucially, all of Noonan's cited cases concern how a court determines whether a given statement is, or could be understood as, defamatory,<sup>[4]</sup> and not with the separate inquiry of whether the statement is true or false. As noted above, the impugned statement must be both defamatory and false for a libel action to lie, and these are distinct elements. Without saying so explicitly, Noonan is, in essence, asking us to import the corpus of legal principles for determining a statement's defamatory nature into the examination of the statement's truth or falsity. Noonan wants us to adopt a rule whereby even an objectively true statement can give rise to a libel claim if reasonable readers might infer from it other, untrue characteristics of the plaintiff or conduct by him.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Noonan, our survey of the relevant Massachusetts law has uncovered no clear support for this interpretation, and we are reluctant to recognize such a significant expansion in view of our limited role as a federal court sitting under our diversity jurisdiction. <i>See </i><i>Gill v. Gulfstream Park Racing Ass'n, Inc.,</i> 399 F.3d 391, 402 (1st Cir.2005) (\"A federal court <span class=\"star-pagination\">*8</span> sitting in diversity cannot be expected to create new doctrines expanding state law.\"); <i>A. Johnson &amp; Co., Inc. v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co.,</i> 933 F.2d 66, 73 n. 10 (1st Cir.1991) (diversity plaintiff \"cannot expect this court `to torture state law into strange configurations or precipitously to blaze new and unprecedented jurisprudential trails'\" (quoting <i>Kotler v. Am. Tobacco Co.,</i> 926 F.2d 1217, 1224 (1st Cir.1990))). Instead, the relevant Massachusetts cases reveal the truth-or-falsity inquiry to be a much simpler one. Our review of the record in the light most favorable to Noonan reveals no triable issue of fact because, as Staples asserts, everything said in the e-mail was trueor at least substantially trueand substantial truth is all that is required.<sup>[5]</sup><i>See </i><i>Murphy v. Boston Herald, Inc.,</i> 449 Mass. 42, 865 N.E.2d 746, 754 (2007); <i>Jones v. Taibbi,</i> 400 Mass. 786, 512 N.E.2d 260, 266 (1987).<sup>[6]</sup></p>\n<p>Given this holding, Noonan's only hope for keeping his libel claim alive is to prove that Staplesor other employees responsible for composing and sending the e-mailacted with actual malice. As noted above, under Massachusetts law, even a true statement can form the basis of a libel action if the plaintiff proves that the defendant acted with actual malice. <i>White,</i> 809 N.E.2d at 1036 n. 4 (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 92); <i>Conroy v. Fall River Herald News Co.,</i> 306 Mass. 488, 28 N.E.2d 729, 731-32 (1940).</p>\n<p>Noonan mounts a two-pronged argument for why a jury could conclude that Staples published the e-mail with actual malice. First, he alleges that Baitler harbored ill-will toward him and wished to cause him harm. In his twelve years with the company, Baitler had never before referred to a fired employee by name in an e-mail or other mass communication, and in his deposition he had difficulty explaining why it was necessary to mention Noonan by name; thus, Noonan avers, \"the language of the libel itself [could] be found as a fact to breathe malevolence.\" <i>Hubbard v. Allyn,</i> 200 Mass. 166, 86 N.E. 356, 359 (1908). As additional evidence of Baitler's ill-will, Noonan points out that Baitler had been Dorman's supervisor and had failed to notice the latter's theft of money from the company; Noonan argues that a jury could infer from the record that Baitler pilloried him to detract attention away from the Dorman scandal and Baitler's embarrassing role in it.</p>\n<p>Second, Noonan claims that the e-mail's excessive publication is evidence of Baitler's, and thus Staples's, actual malice. Baitler had the e-mail sent to all 1,500 or so employees in the North American Division by including in the e-mail's \"To\" field a group recipient called \"Contract Remote.\" Noonan alleges that someone at Staples then deleted the original electronic version of the e-mail despite Noonan's lawyer's written request, and Staples's in-house counsel's subsequent instructions to the relevant managers and employees, that it not be deleted. Because employees are constantly being added to and taken off the Contract Remote list, this deletion made it impossible to determine exactly who was on the list, how many people the list included, and whether the e-mail's recipients then forwarded it to additional persons outside the North American Division or outside the company. Noonan contends <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> that the e-mail's deletion raises a permissible inference that the destroyed evidence must have been unfavorable to Staples, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Blinzler v. Marriott Int'l, Inc.,</i> 81 F.3d 1148, 1158-59 (1st Cir. 1996)namely, that the e-mail was published excessively.</p>\n<p>Neither of these arguments withstands close scrutiny. As for Noonan's first argumentthat Baitler harbored ill-will toward him and thus acted with actual maliceNoonan has provided us with an incorrect and outdated rendition of Massachusetts law.<sup>[7]</sup> The Supreme Judicial Court has clearly stated that actual malice in the defamation context \"does not mean the defendant's dislike of, hatred of, or ill will toward, the plaintiff.\" <i>Rotkiewicz v. Sadowsky,</i> 431 Mass. 748, 730 N.E.2d 282, 289 (2000). Instead, the plaintiff establishes actual malice by proving that the defendant knew the allegedly libelous statement was false when it was published, or that the defendant acted with \"reckless disregard\" for whether it was true or falsethat is, the defendant \"entertained serious doubts\" as to its truth or falsity. <i>McAvoy,</i> 518 N.E.2d at 517-18 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>accord </i><i>Murphy,</i> 865 N.E.2d at 752; <i>see also </i><i>Rotkiewicz,</i> 730 N.E.2d at 289 (\"The inquiry is a subjective one as to the defendant's attitude toward the truth or falsity of the statement rather than the defendant's attitude toward the plaintiff.\" (citing <i>Cantrell v. Forest City Publ'g Co.,</i> 419 U.S. 245, 252, 95 S.Ct. 465, 42 L.Ed.2d 419 (1974))).</p>\n<p>Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Noonan and considering this standard, there is no evidence of actual malice on the part of Baitler or any other relevant Staples employee. It was reasonable for Baitler to rely on the findings of the experienced team of investigators that Staples put together for the purpose of auditing Noonan's expense reports. There is simply nothing in the record to suggest that Baitler or another relevant employee believed Noonan not to have contravened the travel and expense policy, or that they sent the e-mail with reckless disregard for whether Noonan contravened the policy. Moreover, since actual malice in Massachusetts does not equate to hatred or ill-will, <i>Rotkiewicz,</i> 730 N.E.2d at 289, Baitler's own personal feelings toward Noonan are inconsequential, and we need not state a view onor remand for a jury to determinewhether Baitler did indeed dislike Noonan or wish to sabotage his good reputation.</p>\n<p>As for Noonan's second argumentthat the e-mail's excessive publication evinces Staples's actual maliceunder Massachusetts law excessive publication has been interpreted not as a manifestation of actual malice, but as something different. The question of excessive publication routinely comes up in the context of determining whether a defendant has abused its conditional privilege to publish defamatory material. The Massachusetts courts consistently speak of two ways in which the defendant may lose such a privilege: through actual (sometimes called \"express\") malice or, as an alternative, through unnecessary, unreasonable, or excessive publication. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Galvin v. N.Y., New Haven &amp; Hartford R.R. Co.,</i> 341 Mass. 293, 168 N.E.2d 262, 266 (1960) (\"We think the time has now come to recognize that there can be an abuse of a conditional privilege by conduct which cannot fairly be classed as express or actual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> malice.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Petition of Retailers Commercial Agency, Inc.,</i> 342 Mass. 515, 174 N.E.2d 376, 379-80 (1961) (noting the lack of evidence of actual or express malice, but stating that the qualified privilege may be lost nonetheless through unnecessary, unreasonable, or excessive publication); <i>accord </i><i>Mulgrew v. City of Taunton,</i> 410 Mass. 631, 574 N.E.2d 389, 391 (1991); <i>Bratt v. Int'l Bus. Machs., Inc.,</i> 392 Mass. 508, 467 N.E.2d 126, 131 (1984). Thus, even if the record showed that Staples published the e-mail excessively, this would not constitute actual malice under Massachusetts law and render the alleged libel actionable despite its truth.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>For these reasons, the record viewed in the light most favorable to Noonan leads us to conclude that the e-mail is substantially true, that Staples did not act with actual malice and thus did not forfeit its defense of truth, and that no triable issue of material fact therefore remains on Noonan's libel claim.<sup>[9]</sup> We accordingly affirm the district court's summary judgment in favor of Staples on the libel claim, and move on to Noonan's claim that Staples breached its stock-option agreements with him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Breach of Stock-Option Agreements</h2>\n<p>Noonan next argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Staples on his claim that the latter breached the two stock-option agreements by not allowing him to exercise his options. The district court noted the language in the agreements providing that Noonan was ineligible for the stock options if Staples determined that his termination was \"for cause,\" and dismissed the claim because \"Staples's classification of [Noonan's] actions as willful misconduct appears reasonable and applicable in the circumstances.\"</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, we must ascertain the correct rubric through which to evaluate Noonan's assertion that he did not, in fact, engage in willful misconduct or any other activity that would qualify as cause for his firing. Staples contends that we are prohibited from reaching the merits of this question, as the stock-option agreements entrust the decision on what constitutes \"cause\" to Staples, and Staples alone. It argues that several courts have held similar clauses to be a valid limitation on contractual remedies. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>McIntyre v. Phila. Suburban Corp.,</i> 90 F.Supp.2d 596, 600 (E.D.Pa.2000); <i>Stemerman v. Ackerman,</i> 184 A.2d 28, 33 (Del.Ch.1962). Noonan, by contrast, urges us to declare the relevant clauses in the agreements invalid because they violate public policy, because they allow Staples to be the judge in its own case. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Ellis v. Emhart Mfg. Co.,</i> 150 Conn. 501, 191 A.2d 546, 549 (Conn.1963) (clause in stock-option agreement violated public policy by providing that board of directors' interpretation was final and conclusive) (citing, <i>inter alia, </i><i>Patton v. Babson's Statistical Org., Inc.,</i> 259 Mass. 424, 156 N.E. 534, 536 (1927)). Noonan invites us instead to engage in <i>de novo</i> review of whether there was cause to fire him. For the reasons explained below, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> the weight of authority pushes us onto a middle course between these two extremes.</p>\n<p>The question we must answer is whether Staples's contractual prerogative to determine what constitutes \"cause\" is unreviewable. If so, the matter ends there and we need not look at the evidence to determine whether cause did indeed exist for firing Noonan, because Staples undisputably determined that it did. Unlike the inquiry into an alleged libel's truth or falsity discussed abovewhich Massachusetts courts have addressedour survey of Massachusetts law reveals no pronouncement by that state's courts on this precise question. Since this case rests on diversity jurisdiction, we must attempt to divine how the Massachusetts courts, and in particular the Supreme Judicial Court, would answer the question if faced squarely with it. <i>See </i><i>Hardy v. Loon Mt. Recreation Corp.,</i> 276 F.3d 18, 20 (1st Cir.2002); <i>accord </i><i>Liberty Mutual Ins. Co. v. Metro. Life Ins. Co.,</i> 260 F.3d 54, 65 (1st Cir.2001) (\"Absent a decision by the state's highest court, we are free to make our own best guess as to Massachusetts law. . . .\"). In coming up with our \"best guess,\" we may look to analogous decisions from other jurisdictions. <i>Hardy,</i> 276 F.3d at 20 (citing <i>Stratford Sch. Dist., S.A.U. #58 v. Employers Reins. Corp.,</i> 162 F.3d 718, 720 (1st Cir.1998)); <i>see also </i><i>Vigortone AG Prods., Inc. v. PM AG Prods., Inc.,</i> 316 F.3d 641, 644 (7th Cir.2002) (explaining that \"the best guess is that the state's highest court, should it ever be presented with the issues, will line up with the majority of the states\"). We may also find guidance in pronouncements on similar matters by Massachusetts courts.</p>\n<p>Staples points us to what is probably the most closely analogous published case of the handful that exist dealing with this question, <i>Weir v. Anaconda Co.,</i> 773 F.2d 1073 (10th Cir.1985). In that case, Weir and his former employer, the Anaconda Company, had a stock-option plan which gave an Anaconda compensation committee the sole authority to determine whether Weir had been fired for cause, and was thereby precluded from exercising a stock option. Contrary to Staples's suggestion, however, the Tenth Circuit did not hold that the compensation committee's cause decision was unreviewable. <i>Id.</i> at 1078. Instead, according to that court's reading of the applicable Kansas law, the committee's decision should be treated in a manner similar to an agency decision, and thus reviewed for whether it was arbitrary, fraudulent, or made in bad faith. <i>Id.</i> at 1078-79. After evaluating the evidence relating to Weir's firing in the light most favorable to him, the court concluded that the committee's decision suffered from none of these defects, and affirmed summary judgment in favor of Anaconda. <i>See id.</i> at 1081-83. Importantly, the court expressly rejected Weir's request that it apply, as Noonan implores us to do here, a fully <i>de novo</i> standard of review to the committee's decision. <i>Id.</i> at 1078.</p>\n<p>Our survey of other jurisdictions has uncovered several cases adopting similar standards of review. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Scribner v. Worldcom, Inc.,</i> 249 F.3d 902, 909 (9th Cir.2001) (applying Washington law, court reviews stock-option committee's interpretation of plan's terms to determine whether it was made in good faith); <i>Craig v. Pillsbury Non-Qualified Pension Plan,</i> 458 F.3d 748, 752 (8th Cir.2006) (similar); <i>W.R. Berkley Corp. v. Hall,</i> No. Civ.A. 03C-12-146WCC, 2005 WL 406348, at *4 (Del.Super.Ct. Feb.16, 2005) (unpublished) (when stock-option committee is vested with final authority to determine rights under plan, court will not second-guess its decision absent showing of fraud or bad faith); <i>Schwartz v. Century Circuit, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*12</span> 163 A.2d 793, 796 (Del.Ch.1960) (similar). These standards, and that propounded by the <i>Weir</i> court, comport with the standard consistently used by Massachusetts courts for determining whether a government official acted properly in discharging another government employee. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Flomenbaum v. Commonwealth,</i> 451 Mass. 740, 889 N.E.2d 423, 429 (2008) (arbitrary or capricious); <i>Levy v. Acting Governor,</i> 436 Mass. 736, 767 N.E.2d 66, 79 (2002); <i>McSweeney v. Town Manager of Lexington,</i> 379 Mass. 794, 401 N.E.2d 113, 117 (1980); <i>cf., e.g., </i><i>Madera v. Marsh USA, Inc.,</i> 426 F.3d 56, 63-64 (1st Cir.2005) (where ERISA benefits plan gives plan administrator or fiduciary discretionary authority to determine employee's eligibility for benefits, the determination is subject to an arbitrary and capricious standard of review, and the decision must be upheld \"`if there is any reasonable basis for it'\") (quoting <i>Brigham v. Sun Life of Can.,</i> 317 F.3d 72, 81 (1st Cir.2003)).</p>\n<p>In view of this authority, our best prediction is that the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court would hold that Staples's \"for cause\" decision is not unreviewable, nor reviewable <i>de novo,</i><sup>[10]</sup> but instead that the courts may perform a limited review of the decision to determine if it was arbitrary, capricious, or made in bad faith.<sup>[11]</sup> Even if we might disagree with Staples's action regarding Noonan's firing, if Staples's decision was not arbitrary, capricious, or made in bad faith, then we must accord it deference, and consequently affirm the denial of Noonan's stock options under the plain terms of the agreements. <i>Cf., e.g., </i><i>Mesnick v. Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> 950 F.2d 816, 825 (1st Cir.1991) (courts are not \"super personnel departments,\" and should not ordinarily second-guess employers' business decisions). In performing this portion of the inquiry, we adopt the definition of \"cause\" common to both stock-option agreementswillful misconduct or willful failure to perform responsibilities in the best interests of Staplesa definition which Noonan seems to accept as applicable here. <i>Cf. </i><i>DiPietro v. Sipex Corp.,</i> 69 Mass.App.Ct. 29, 865 N.E.2d 1190, 1194 n. 3 (2007) (applying definition of \"for cause\" as set forth in the relevant agreement).</p>\n<p>Noonan argues that, while he undoubtedly committed a number of errors on the expense reports audited by Staples's investigation team, these were merely the result of inadvertence or carelessness, and not a willful attempt to defraud Staples. At the very least, Noonan contends, the determination of whether his conduct was willful involves looking into his state of mind, a question ordinarily reserved for the jury. <i>See </i><i>Maimaron v. Commonwealth,</i> 449 Mass. 167, 865 N.E.2d 1098, 1109 (2007). Again, however, our task hereand the jury's, if this case were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> to survive summary judgmentis not to determine whether Noonan did indeed act willfully, but whether Staples's assessment that he acted willfully was arbitrary, capricious, or made in bad faith. Notwithstanding a viewing of the evidence in Noonan's favor, we hold that there is no material fact in dispute on this issue.</p>\n<p>Noonan does not dispute that the team of investigators was competent and experienced. The team looked at not just one or two of his expense reports, but at thirty-seven, spread across 2005. It uncovered dozens of instances in which Noonan claimed more than he was entitled to and determined unanimously that the discrepancies must have been intentional. Our review of the record reveals no material dispute of this fact. Even if, in fact, the dozens of discrepancies were all the result of some extreme sloppiness or inattentiveness on Noonan's part (as he rather unblushingly contends), we discern no triable issue of fact on whether the teamand the Staples officers who reviewed and acted upon the team's findingshad a good-faith basis for concluding that Noonan deliberately doctored these entries. For example, even taking Noonan's $1,100 Big Mac as an honest keypadding slip (as Noonan claims it was), the several entries showing the item claimed as exactly $100 more than it actually cost are extremely damaging to Noonan's case. The record reveals that the team found these to refute his claim that the discrepancies were merely instances in which he pre-populated the expense report (that is, he guessed at how much the item would cost) and simply forgot to go back and correct the entry later after he bought it and knew how much it actually cost. Also damaging to Noonan's case, and taken into account by the team, was his failure to notice (and his inability to explain this failure to the investigators) the large amounts of extra money being deposited into his account as a result of his over-reimbursements.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>Therefore, regardless of whether Noonan also made errors that, in the end, resulted in an ultimate windfall for Staples,<sup>[13]</sup> the evidence viewed in Noonan's favor still shows highly suspicious expense-reporting practices sufficient to ground a finding that Noonan intentionally manipulated at least some expense reports so that he would receive money he did not deserve. As Noonan repeatedly argues or intimates, Staples may have been wiser to conduct yet another, even more searching investigation into his conduct; to give him a second chance before firing him; to impose some less-severe form of discipline; or to punish other violators in the North American Divisionof whom Noonan claims there were manywith the same harsh penalty. Nevertheless, even indulging Noonan all reasonable inferences, we cannot say that Staples's decision that Noonan engaged in willful misconduct or willfully failed to perform his duties in its best interestbased as it was on the findings of experienced auditorswas arbitrary, capricious, or made in bad faith.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, there is no triable issue of material fact with respect to Staples's decision that cause existed to fire <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> Noonan, and under the plain terms of the stock-option agreements, Staples was thus entitled to determine Noonan ineligible for the stock options. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Staples on Noonan's claims concerning the stock-option agreements, and we move on to his last ground of appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Breach of Severance Agreement</h2>\n<p>Lastly, Noonan contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Staples on his claim that it violated the severance agreement. We need not dwell long on this ground of appeal because it is foreclosed by the plain terms of the relevant instruments. The severance agreement provided that Noonan would not receive his severance benefits if Staples terminated him \"for `[c]ause.'\" Another clause in the agreement provided that \"cause,\" for purposes of the severance agreement, includes a violation of Staples's Code of Ethics. The Code of Ethics, in turn, contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote>We expect you to keep accurate records and reports. . . . All company books, records, and accounts must be maintained in accordance with all applicable regulations and standards and accurately reflect the transactions they record. . . . We do not permit . . . false or misleading entries in the company's books or records for any reason. . . .</blockquote>\n<p>Even viewed in the light most favorable to Noonan, the evidence in the record readily shows that he failed to abide by this clause of the Code of Ethics.<sup>[14]</sup> As Staples suggests, even if all of Noonan's many expense-reporting discrepancies were simply careless mistakes or instances where he forgot to amend pre-populated entries after figuring out what the item actually cost, the mere fact that he deliberately created inaccurate entries through the practice of pre-population transgresses this provision. Thus, under the plain terms of the severance agreement, Noonan was fired for cause, as that term is specifically defined in that agreement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cabot Corp. v. AVX Corp.,</i> 448 Mass. 629, 863 N.E.2d 503, 513 (2007) (where a contract's language is unambiguous, its interpretation is a question of law that may be resolved on summary judgment); <i>Eigerman v. Putnam Invs., Inc.,</i> 450 Mass. 281, 877 N.E.2d 1258, 1263 (2007) (courts interpret contracts according to plain terms where these are unambiguous). The district court therefore acted properly in determining that Noonan forfeited his entitlement to severance benefits, and summary judgment in favor of Staples on this claim also must stand.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Staples in all respects.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Noonan made two other claims that were also dismissed by the district court. He does not appeal those dismissals.</p>\n<p>[2]  The parties do not dispute that the first element of Noonan's libel claim, which \"requires that the defendant communicate the defamatory statement to a third party,\" <i>White v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Mass., Inc.,</i> 442 Mass. 64, 809 N.E.2d 1034, 1036 (2004), was satisfied by the sending of the Baitler e-mail to some 1,500 Staples employees. The parties likewise do not dispute that the e-mail concerned the plaintiff, Noonan. Given our holding below affirming the district court's grant of summary judgment on Noonan's libel claim due to the absence of the fourth element, we need not reach the question of whether the third and fifth elements are fulfilled on the record of this case.</p>\n<p>[3]  For this reason, we need not attempt to determine whose calculationsNoonan's or Staples'swere correct, or whether it was Noonan or Staples who received the ultimate windfall from Noonan's typographical and mathematical errors.</p>\n<p>[4]  Massachusetts courts engage in a similar inquiry when determining the second element of a libel claim  whether the statement is of or concerning the plaintiff. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Stanton,</i> 438 F.3d at 128 (\"Like the question of whether a communication can reasonably be understood to be defamatory, whether a communication can reasonably be understood to be of and concerning the plaintiff depends on the circumstances.\") (citing <i>New Eng. Tractor-Trailer of Conn., Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co.,</i> 395 Mass. 471, 480 N.E.2d 1005, 1010 n. 5 (1985)).</p>\n<p>[5]  Thus, even though Noonan may dispute whether the investigation was, as the Baitler e-mail characterized it, \"thorough,\" this minor detail does not deprive the e-mail of its substantially true character.</p>\n<p>[6]  To the extent the brief discussion in <i>Perry v. Hearst Corp.,</i> 334 F.2d 800, 801-02 (1st Cir. 1964), suggests a different outcome, we do not believe that such an outcome comports with Massachusetts law as it stands today.</p>\n<p>[7]  Older Massachusetts law, cited by Noonan, defined actual malice for a libel claim in the more traditional sense of hatred or ill-will. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Fay v. Harrington,</i> 176 Mass. 270, 57 N.E. 369, 371 (1900). This law has been superseded by the modern definition. <i>See</i> Richard W. Bishop, 17A <i>Mass. Practice</i> § 43.6 n. 5.</p>\n<p>[8]  The possibility that Staples may have destroyed the electronic version of the e-mail notwithstanding requests to preserve it does not compel a contrary result. This is so because the actual malice inquiry turns on the defendant's state of mind at the time it published the alleged libel, and it is undisputed that the Baitler e-mail's possible destruction took place several days after its publication.</p>\n<p>[9]  Because we conclude that no actionable libel was published in the first place, we need not reach the question of whether Staples nonetheless retained its conditional privilegea point argued at length by both parties.</p>\n<p>[10]  Noonan claims that we are bound by the <i>Patton</i> case, in which the Supreme Judicial Court held invalid a contractual clause giving a company president the sole authority to determine whether a fired employee would receive a deferred salary. <i>See </i><i>Patton,</i> 156 N.E. at 536. Yet Massachusetts courts strongly favor the freedom of contract absent serious misconduct or fraud. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sound Techniques, Inc. v. Hoffman,</i> 50 Mass.App.Ct. 425, 737 N.E.2d 920, 927 (2000). There is no evidence in the record that Noonan, a sophisticated party, was under duress when he signed onto the stock-option agreements, or that the agreements suffered from some other infirmity invalidating their plain terms. In any event, <i>Patton</i> dates from 1927, and we do not think the Court would take the same view today when faced with a modern stock-option agreement like the two at issue here.</p>\n<p>[11]  At another point in its brief, Staples concedes that its cause decision must have been made in good faith, and that we have the authority to review the decision at least to that extent.</p>\n<p>[12]  Another relevant factor is that Staples's termination letter to Noonan told him that he was being fired for cause. <i>See </i><i>Hammond v. T.J. Litle &amp; Co.,</i> 82 F.3d 1166, 1175 (1st Cir. 1996) (applying Massachusetts law and remarking that \"when an employee may only be terminated for cause, whether the employer so informs the employee plays a decisive role in a court's later determination of whether the employee was discharged for cause\").</p>\n<p>[13]  As noted above, the parties vigorously dispute which party received the ultimate windfall. We need not determine who is correct on this question in order to resolve the issues presented in this appeal. <i>See supra</i> note 3.</p>\n<p>[14]  The quoted language comes from the 2005 version of the Code of Ethics. Noonan seems to argue that he was bound by the 2001 version of the Code; Staples asserts that he was bound by the 2005 version. We need not decide which party is correct, as the relevant language in the 2001 version is identical.</p>\n<p>[15]  We add that the 2004 Stock-Option Agreement (but not the 1992 Stock-Option Agreement) also included violation of the Code of Ethics as a ground constituting \"cause.\" Summary judgment in favor of Staples with respect to that agreement could therefore have been affirmed for this reason as an alternative to the ground discussed above.</p>\n\n</div>",

Noonan was fired from his job as a salesman at Staples, Inc. for allegedly padding expense reports. A Staples executive then sent a mass e-mail to about 1,500 employees informing them that Noonan had been fired for violating the company's travel and expense policy. Staples also denied Noonan his severance benefits and refused to allow him to exercise his stock options, claiming that, under the terms of the agreements setting forth the right to these benefits, Noonan was ineligible because he had been fired \"for cause.\" Noonan sued Staples in Massachusetts court for libel and breach of those agreements, and Staples removed to federal court. Both parties moved for summary judgment, the district court granted summary judgment in favor of Staples, and Noonan now appeals. After careful consideration, we affirm.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>\n<span class=\"star-pagination\">*3</span> I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Because this case comes to us on appeal from summary judgment, we relate the relevant facts in the light that most favors the nonmovant, Noonan. <i>Franceschi v. U.S. Dep't of Veterans Affairs,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203122\"><a href=\"/opinion/203122/franceschi-v-us-dept-of-veterans-affairs/\"><span class=\"volume\">514</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">81</span></a></span>, 83 (1st Cir.2008). Noonan was a Staples sales director who did much traveling for business and had to compile expense reports to be reimbursed for travel, food, and other business-related expenses. Staples had a travel and expense policy requiring employees to submit receipts for all expenses over $75, and for all meals regardless of price; to use their corporate credit card for business expenses instead of their personal credit card; and to book all work-related travel through Staples's travel department. Noonan claims, with support in the record, that these directives were irregularly enforced and often not followed by many employees.</p>\n<p>In November 2005, Staples discovered that an employee named James Dorman had been embezzling money from the company through fraudulent expense claims and fired him. It then undertook an audit of expense reports based on a sample of sixty-five traveling employees in the North American Division, including Noonan. Auditors investigating Noonan discovered a May 2005 expense report in which he had requested $1,622 in excess of what he had actually spent. The team also found that Noonan had used his personal credit card for many of these purchases, had booked the travel through a non-company travel agent, and had failed to submit all the required receipts.</p>\n<p>These anomalies led Staples to assemble a special team, composed of certified accountants and a former police investigator, to look further into Noonan's past expense reports. Noonan admitted to the team that he often \"pre-populated\" his reports before a given tripthat is, he estimated what his expenses would be in advance, and submitted the report with these estimates, but with (Noonan claims) the intention to amend the report later to the extent the actual expenses differed from the estimates. The team found that Noonan had failed to enter such adjustments on a number of expense reports and discovered other anomalies, such as entries where the amount claimed was exactly $100 more than what the item actually cost, and entries where decimal points had been shifted two places to the right (resulting, for example, in an $1,129 meal at an airport McDonald's, instead of $11.29). Noonan also committed errors in Staples's favor. When the team asked him about the large amounts of extra money that had been deposited into his checking account, Noonan responded that he had not noticed.</p>\n<p>Based on its findings, the team unanimously concluded that Noonan had deliberately falsified the audited expense reports and, as a result, Staples fired him. It sent him a letter stating that he had been terminated \"for cause\" for violating the travel and expense policy and the company's Code of Ethics, and that he was consequently ineligible for severance benefits. The following day, Executive Vice-President Jay Baitler sent an e-mail to all the employees in Staples's North American Division, a group whose precise number is unknown and disputed, but that totaled somewhere around 1,500 people. The e-mail stated as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>It is with sincere regret that I must inform you of the termination of Alan Noonan's employment with Staples. A thorough investigation determined that Alan was not in compliance with our [travel and expenses] policies. As always, our policies are consistently applied to everyone and compliance is mandatory on everyone's part. It is incumbent on all managers to understand <span class=\"star-pagination\">*4</span> Staples['s] policies and to consistently communicate, educate and monitor compliance every single day. Compliance with company policies is not subject to personal discretion and is not optional. In addition to ensuring compliance, the approver's responsibility to monitor and question is a critical factor in effective management of this and all policies.</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If you have any questions about Staples['s] policies or Code of Ethics, call the Ethics Hotline . . . or ask your human resources manager.</blockquote>\n<p>Over the course of Noonan's employment, he and Staples entered into two stock-option agreements, dating respectively from 1992 and 2004 (respectively, the \"1992 Stock-Option Agreement\" and the \"2004 Stock-Option Agreement\"). The pertinent language in the 1992 Stock-Option Agreement provided as follows:</p>\n<blockquote>[I]f [Noonan's] relationship with Staples is terminated by Staples for \"cause\" (as defined below) . . . the right to exercise this option with respect to any shares not previously exercised shall terminate immediately. . . .</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\"Cause\" shall mean willful misconduct by [Noonan] or willful failure to perform his or her responsibilities in the best interests of Staples (including, without limitation, breach by [Noonan] of any provision of any employment, consulting, advisory, nondisclosure, non-competition or other similar agreement between [Noonan] and Staples), <i>as determined by Staples,</i> which determination shall be conclusive.</blockquote>\n<p>(Emphasis added.) The 2004 Stock-Option Agreement contained this language, and added other grounds constituting \"cause,\" including \"violation by [Noonan] of the Code of Ethics or an attempt by [Noonan] to secure any improper personal profit in connection with the business of Staples.\"</p>\n<p>Six days before being fired, Noonan sent Staples a $290,714.40 check and notified it that he was exercising his vested right to purchase 23,825 shares of stock-22,700 governed by the 1992 Stock-Option Agreement, and 1,125 governed by the 2004 Stock-Option Agreement. Staples returned the check uncashed, noting that the investigation into Noonan's expense-reporting practices was ongoing, and that if Staples ultimately terminated him for cause, he would not be entitled to gains on the shares. Staples did not ultimately allow Noonan to exercise the stock options.</p>\n<p>Noonan also had a severance agreement with Staples which stated that Staples would not be required to pay benefits if Noonan was terminated \"for `[c]ause'\" that is, if Noonan \"wilfully fail[ed] to substantially perform [his] duties with Staples,\" \"violate[d] the Code of Ethics or attempt[ed] to secure any improper personal profit,\" or \"engage[d] in misconduct which is demonstrably and materially injurious to Staples. . . .\" On these grounds, Staples did not give Noonan severance benefits.</p>\n<p>Noonan, a Florida resident, filed suit in Massachusetts state court; Staples, a Massachusetts corporation, removed to the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. Noonan's complaint alleged (1) libel based on the Baitler e-mail; (2) breach of the two stock-option agreements; and (3) breach of the severance agreement.<sup>[1]</sup> Noonan moved for summary judgment <span class=\"star-pagination\">*5</span> on a portion of the libel claim and on the claim alleging breach of the stock-option agreements; Staples filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on all counts in the complaint. The district court granted summary judgment on behalf of Staples. On the libel claim, the district court determined that what was stated in the e-mail was true, and that Noonan had presented no evidence of actual malice on the part of Staples. On the breach-of-contract claims, the court found that Noonan had been fired for cause and that, pursuant to the terms of the agreements, he was therefore ineligible for the stock options and benefits. Noonan now appeals.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A.

Massachusetts law, however, recognizes a narrow exception to this defense: the truth or falsity of the statement is immaterial, and the libel action may proceed, if the plaintiff can show that the defendant acted with \"actual malice\" in publishing the statement. <i>White,</i> 809 N.E.2d at 1036 n. 4 (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 92).</p>\n<p>Noonan argued before the district court, and reiterates before us, that Baitler's e-mail was both defamatory and false, and thus constituted actionable libel. Staples countered that the evidence clearly established that Noonan did indeed violate the company's travel and expense policy, and that the e-mail was consequently true and no libel action could lie. The district court sided with Staples, concluding that Noonan's libel claim could not proceed as a matter of law because the Baitler e-mail was true: even when viewed in the light most favorable to Noonan, the record demonstrates that he failed to comply with the policy. Our review of the record and Massachusetts law leads us to the same conclusion. Thus, there is no triable issue of fact on the question of truth.</p>\n<p>We focus first on Noonan's arguments concerning the e-mail's falsity, because if the evidence corroborates Staples's asserted defense that the e-mail's contents were true, then absent actual malice on the part of Staples, the libel claim must be dismissed regardless of whether the e-mail defamed Noonan. <i>See id.</i> at 1036. Noonan does not seriously challenge that, on their face, all the sentences in the e-mail were true. As the e-mail states and the record bears out, Staples did indeed commission an investigation of Noonan's expense-reporting practices, and the investigators determined that he was not in compliance with the travel and expense policy. Even Noonan admits that he frequently disregarded the letter of the policy, booking travel with non-company travel agents, using his personal credit card instead of the company card, and failing to turn in receipts. Whether, as Noonan asserts, he actually saved Staples money-through, for example, buying cheaper plane tickets from online agents or committing mathematical or typographical errors on his expense reports in Staples's favor-is immaterial.<sup>[3]</sup> Whether, as Noonan asserts, many other traveling employees also regularly disregarded the policy is likewise irrelevant. Even taking these assertions as accurate, they do not change the simple fact relayed in the e-mail, and supported by the evidence in the record, that Staples fired Noonan after an investigation determined him to be out of compliance with the travel and expense policy.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*7</span> Noonan urges us, however, to look beyond the letter of the e-mail to the effect it must have had on its approximately 1,500 recipients. He argues that reasonable recipients could have read other passages in the e-mail and, viewing the e-mail in its totality, drawn the inference that he arrogantly regarded Staples's policies as subject to his personal whim and committed some sort of grave misconductgrave enough that Baitler himself departed from company policy on employee privacy by referring to Noonan by name in the e-mail. Indeed, according to Noonan, the e-mail's reference to an \"investigation,\" the recent experience with the firing and later indictment of Dorman for stealing money from the company, and the fact that Staples took the drastic step of terminating Noonan instead of merely reprimanding him or delaying the relevant reimbursements, could have led reasonable readers to conclude that he, like Dorman, committed a crime. At the very least, the e-mail's reference to the company Code of Ethics could have given reasonable readers the impression that Noonan was terminated for illegal or unethical conduct in the reporting of his travel expenses. As support for these arguments, Noonan cites a number of cases applying Massachusetts law and holding that, to determine whether a given statement is defamatory, the court must look at it as a whole and in the context in which it was published. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Stanton,</i> 438 F.3d at 125, 128; <i>Foley,</i> 533 N.E.2d at 197 (court must examine statement \"`in its totality in the context in which it was uttered or published[,] . . . consider[ing] all the words used, not merely a particular phrase or sentence'\") (quoting <i>Myers v.

As noted above, the impugned statement must be both defamatory and false for a libel action to lie, and these are distinct elements. Without saying so explicitly, Noonan is, in essence, asking us to import the corpus of legal principles for determining a statement's defamatory nature into the examination of the statement's truth or falsity. Noonan wants us to adopt a rule whereby even an objectively true statement can give rise to a libel claim if reasonable readers might infer from it other, untrue characteristics of the plaintiff or conduct by him.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately for Noonan, our survey of the relevant Massachusetts law has uncovered no clear support for this interpretation, and we are reluctant to recognize such a significant expansion in view of our limited role as a federal court sitting under our diversity jurisdiction. <i>See </i><i>Gill v.

Instead, the relevant Massachusetts cases reveal the truth-or-falsity inquiry to be a much simpler one. Our review of the record in the light most favorable to Noonan reveals no triable issue of fact because, as Staples asserts, everything said in the e-mail was trueor at least substantially trueand substantial truth is all that is required.<sup>[5]</sup><i>See </i><i>Murphy v.

As noted above, under Massachusetts law, even a true statement can form the basis of a libel action if the plaintiff proves that the defendant acted with actual malice. <i>White,</i> 809 N.E.2d at 1036 n. 4 (citing Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 231, § 92); <i>Conroy v. Fall River Herald News Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">488</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">729</span></span>, 731-32 (1940).</p>\n<p>Noonan mounts a two-pronged argument for why a jury could conclude that Staples published the e-mail with actual malice. First, he alleges that Baitler harbored ill-will toward him and wished to cause him harm. In his twelve years with the company, Baitler had never before referred to a fired employee by name in an e-mail or other mass communication, and in his deposition he had difficulty explaining why it was necessary to mention Noonan by name; thus, Noonan avers, \"the language of the libel itself [could] be found as a fact to breathe malevolence.\" <i>Hubbard v. Allyn,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">200</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">166</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">86</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">356</span></span>, 359 (1908). As additional evidence of Baitler's ill-will, Noonan points out that Baitler had been Dorman's supervisor and had failed to notice the latter's theft of money from the company; Noonan argues that a jury could infer from the record that Baitler pilloried him to detract attention away from the Dorman scandal and Baitler's embarrassing role in it.</p>\n<p>Second, Noonan claims that the e-mail's excessive publication is evidence of Baitler's, and thus Staples's, actual malice. Baitler had the e-mail sent to all 1,500 or so employees in the North American Division by including in the e-mail's \"To\" field a group recipient called \"Contract Remote.\" Noonan alleges that someone at Staples then deleted the original electronic version of the e-mail despite Noonan's lawyer's written request, and Staples's in-house counsel's subsequent instructions to the relevant managers and employees, that it not be deleted. Because employees are constantly being added to and taken off the Contract Remote list, this deletion made it impossible to determine exactly who was on the list, how many people the list included, and whether the e-mail's recipients then forwarded it to additional persons outside the North American Division or outside the company. Noonan contends <span class=\"star-pagination\">*9</span> that the e-mail's deletion raises a permissible inference that the destroyed evidence must have been unfavorable to Staples, <i>see, e.g., </i><i>Blinzler v.

As for Noonan's first argumentthat Baitler harbored ill-will toward him and thus acted with actual maliceNoonan has provided us with an incorrect and outdated rendition of Massachusetts law.<sup>[7]</sup> The Supreme Judicial Court has clearly stated that actual malice in the defamation context \"does not mean the defendant's dislike of, hatred of, or ill will toward, the plaintiff.\" <i>Rotkiewicz v. Sadowsky,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">431</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">748</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">730</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">282</span></span>, 289 (2000). Instead, the plaintiff establishes actual malice by proving that the defendant knew the allegedly libelous statement was false when it was published, or that the defendant acted with \"reckless disregard\" for whether it was true or falsethat is, the defendant \"entertained serious doubts\" as to its truth or falsity. <i>McAvoy,</i> 518 N.E.2d at 517-18 (citation and internal quotation marks omitted); <i>accord </i><i>Murphy,</i> 865 N.E.2d at 752; <i>see also </i><i>Rotkiewicz,</i> 730 N.E.2d at 289 (\"The inquiry is a subjective one as to the defendant's attitude toward the truth or falsity of the statement rather than the defendant's attitude toward the plaintiff.\" (citing <i>Cantrell v. Forest City Publ'g Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109120\"><a href=\"/opinion/109120/cantrell-v-forest-city-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">419</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">245</span></a></span>, 252, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"109120\"><a href=\"/opinion/109120/cantrell-v-forest-city-publishing-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">95</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">419</span></a></span> (1974))).</p>\n<p>Viewing the record in the light most favorable to Noonan and considering this standard, there is no evidence of actual malice on the part of Baitler or any other relevant Staples employee. It was reasonable for Baitler to rely on the findings of the experienced team of investigators that Staples put together for the purpose of auditing Noonan's expense reports. There is simply nothing in the record to suggest that Baitler or another relevant employee believed Noonan not to have contravened the travel and expense policy, or that they sent the e-mail with reckless disregard for whether Noonan contravened the policy. Moreover, since actual malice in Massachusetts does not equate to hatred or ill-will, <i>Rotkiewicz,</i> 730 N.E.2d at 289, Baitler's own personal feelings toward Noonan are inconsequential, and we need not state a view onor remand for a jury to determinewhether Baitler did indeed dislike Noonan or wish to sabotage his good reputation.</p>\n<p>As for Noonan's second argumentthat the e-mail's excessive publication evinces Staples's actual maliceunder Massachusetts law excessive publication has been interpreted not as a manifestation of actual malice, but as something different. The question of excessive publication routinely comes up in the context of determining whether a defendant has abused its conditional privilege to publish defamatory material. The Massachusetts courts consistently speak of two ways in which the defendant may lose such a privilege: through actual (sometimes called \"express\") malice or, as an alternative, through unnecessary, unreasonable, or excessive publication. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Galvin v. N.Y., New Haven &amp; Hartford R.R. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2000512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2000512/galvin-v-new-york-new-haven-hartford-railroad/\"><span class=\"volume\">341</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">293</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2000512\"><a href=\"/opinion/2000512/galvin-v-new-york-new-haven-hartford-railroad/\"><span class=\"volume\">168</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">262</span></a></span>, 266 (1960) (\"We think the time has now come to recognize that there can be an abuse of a conditional privilege by conduct which cannot fairly be classed as express or actual <span class=\"star-pagination\">*10</span> malice.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Petition of Retailers Commercial Agency, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2226148\"><a href=\"/opinion/2226148/retailers-commercial-agency-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">342</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">515</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2226148\"><a href=\"/opinion/2226148/retailers-commercial-agency-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">174</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">376</span></a></span>, 379-80 (1961) (noting the lack of evidence of actual or express malice, but stating that the qualified privilege may be lost nonetheless through unnecessary, unreasonable, or excessive publication); <i>accord </i><i>Mulgrew v.

Thus, even if the record showed that Staples published the e-mail excessively, this would not constitute actual malice under Massachusetts law and render the alleged libel actionable despite its truth.<sup>[8]</sup></p>\n<p>For these reasons, the record viewed in the light most favorable to Noonan leads us to conclude that the e-mail is substantially true, that Staples did not act with actual malice and thus did not forfeit its defense of truth, and that no triable issue of material fact therefore remains on Noonan's libel claim.<sup>[9]</sup> We accordingly affirm the district court's summary judgment in favor of Staples on the libel claim, and move on to Noonan's claim that Staples breached its stock-option agreements with him.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Breach of Stock-Option Agreements</h2>\n<p>Noonan next argues that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Staples on his claim that the latter breached the two stock-option agreements by not allowing him to exercise his options. The district court noted the language in the agreements providing that Noonan was ineligible for the stock options if Staples determined that his termination was \"for cause,\" and dismissed the claim because \"Staples's classification of [Noonan's] actions as willful misconduct appears reasonable and applicable in the circumstances.\"</p>\n<p>As an initial matter, we must ascertain the correct rubric through which to evaluate Noonan's assertion that he did not, in fact, engage in willful misconduct or any other activity that would qualify as cause for his firing. Staples contends that we are prohibited from reaching the merits of this question, as the stock-option agreements entrust the decision on what constitutes \"cause\" to Staples, and Staples alone. It argues that several courts have held similar clauses to be a valid limitation on contractual remedies. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>McIntyre v. Phila. Suburban Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2479159\"><a href=\"/opinion/2479159/mcintyre-v-philadelphia-suburban-corp/\"><span class=\"volume\">90</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Noonan, by contrast, urges us to declare the relevant clauses in the agreements invalid because they violate public policy, because they allow Staples to be the judge in its own case. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Ellis v. Emhart Mfg. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1539361\"><a href=\"/opinion/1539361/ellis-v-emhart-mfg-co/\"><span class=\"volume\">150</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Conn.</span> <span class=\"page\">501</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">546</span></span>, 549 (Conn.1963) (clause in stock-option agreement violated public policy by providing that board of directors' interpretation was final and conclusive) (citing, <i>inter alia, </i><i>Patton v. Babson's Statistical Org., Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">259</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">424</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">156</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">534</span></span>, 536 (1927)). Noonan invites us instead to engage in <i>de novo</i> review of whether there was cause to fire him. For the reasons explained below, <span class=\"star-pagination\">*11</span> the weight of authority pushes us onto a middle course between these two extremes.</p>\n<p>The question we must answer is whether Staples's contractual prerogative to determine what constitutes \"cause\" is unreviewable. If so, the matter ends there and we need not look at the evidence to determine whether cause did indeed exist for firing Noonan, because Staples undisputably determined that it did. Unlike the inquiry into an alleged libel's truth or falsity discussed abovewhich Massachusetts courts have addressedour survey of Massachusetts law reveals no pronouncement by that state's courts on this precise question. Since this case rests on diversity jurisdiction, we must attempt to divine how the Massachusetts courts, and in particular the Supreme Judicial Court, would answer the question if faced squarely with it. <i>See </i><i>Hardy v. Loon Mt. Recreation Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199761\"><a href=\"/opinion/199761/hardy-v-loon-mountain/\"><span class=\"volume\">276</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span>, 20 (1st Cir.2002); <i>accord </i><i>Liberty Mutual Ins.

In coming up with our \"best guess,\" we may look to analogous decisions from other jurisdictions. <i>Hardy,</i> 276 F.3d at 20 (citing <i>Stratford Sch. Dist., S.A.U. #58 v. Employers Reins. Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198249\"><a href=\"/opinion/198249/stratford-v-employers/\"><span class=\"volume\">162</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">718</span></a></span>, 720 (1st Cir.1998)); <i>see also </i><i>Vigortone AG Prods., Inc. v.

We may also find guidance in pronouncements on similar matters by Massachusetts courts.</p>\n<p>Staples points us to what is probably the most closely analogous published case of the handful that exist dealing with this question, <i>Weir v. Anaconda Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"458770\"><a href=\"/opinion/458770/robert-a-weir-v-the-anaconda-company-atlantic-richfield-company-and-the/\"><span class=\"volume\">773</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1073</span></a></span> (10th Cir.1985). In that case, Weir and his former employer, the Anaconda Company, had a stock-option plan which gave an Anaconda compensation committee the sole authority to determine whether Weir had been fired for cause, and was thereby precluded from exercising a stock option. Contrary to Staples's suggestion, however, the Tenth Circuit did not hold that the compensation committee's cause decision was unreviewable. <i>Id.</i> at 1078. Instead, according to that court's reading of the applicable Kansas law, the committee's decision should be treated in a manner similar to an agency decision, and thus reviewed for whether it was arbitrary, fraudulent, or made in bad faith. <i>Id.</i> at 1078-79. After evaluating the evidence relating to Weir's firing in the light most favorable to him, the court concluded that the committee's decision suffered from none of these defects, and affirmed summary judgment in favor of Anaconda. <i>See id.</i> at 1081-83. Importantly, the court expressly rejected Weir's request that it apply, as Noonan implores us to do here, a fully <i>de novo</i> standard of review to the committee's decision. <i>Id.</i> at 1078.</p>\n<p>Our survey of other jurisdictions has uncovered several cases adopting similar standards of review. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Scribner v.

Gen. Elec. Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"573068\"><a href=\"/opinion/573068/samuel-mesnick-v-general-electric-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">950</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">816</span></a></span>, 825 (1st Cir.1991) (courts are not \"super personnel departments,\" and should not ordinarily second-guess employers' business decisions). In performing this portion of the inquiry, we adopt the definition of \"cause\" common to both stock-option agreementswillful misconduct or willful failure to perform responsibilities in the best interests of Staplesa definition which Noonan seems to accept as applicable here. <i>Cf. </i><i>DiPietro v. Sipex Corp.,</i> 69 Mass.App.Ct. 29, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1190</span></span>, 1194 n. 3 (2007) (applying definition of \"for cause\" as set forth in the relevant agreement).</p>\n<p>Noonan argues that, while he undoubtedly committed a number of errors on the expense reports audited by Staples's investigation team, these were merely the result of inadvertence or carelessness, and not a willful attempt to defraud Staples. At the very least, Noonan contends, the determination of whether his conduct was willful involves looking into his state of mind, a question ordinarily reserved for the jury. <i>See </i><i>Maimaron v. Commonwealth,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">449</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">167</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">865</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1098</span></span>, 1109 (2007). Again, however, our task hereand the jury's, if this case were <span class=\"star-pagination\">*13</span> to survive summary judgmentis not to determine whether Noonan did indeed act willfully, but whether Staples's assessment that he acted willfully was arbitrary, capricious, or made in bad faith. Notwithstanding a viewing of the evidence in Noonan's favor, we hold that there is no material fact in dispute on this issue.</p>\n<p>Noonan does not dispute that the team of investigators was competent and experienced. The team looked at not just one or two of his expense reports, but at thirty-seven, spread across 2005. It uncovered dozens of instances in which Noonan claimed more than he was entitled to and determined unanimously that the discrepancies must have been intentional. Our review of the record reveals no material dispute of this fact. Even if, in fact, the dozens of discrepancies were all the result of some extreme sloppiness or inattentiveness on Noonan's part (as he rather unblushingly contends), we discern no triable issue of fact on whether the teamand the Staples officers who reviewed and acted upon the team's findingshad a good-faith basis for concluding that Noonan deliberately doctored these entries. For example, even taking Noonan's $1,100 Big Mac as an honest keypadding slip (as Noonan claims it was), the several entries showing the item claimed as exactly $100 more than it actually cost are extremely damaging to Noonan's case. The record reveals that the team found these to refute his claim that the discrepancies were merely instances in which he pre-populated the expense report (that is, he guessed at how much the item would cost) and simply forgot to go back and correct the entry later after he bought it and knew how much it actually cost. Also damaging to Noonan's case, and taken into account by the team, was his failure to notice (and his inability to explain this failure to the investigators) the large amounts of extra money being deposited into his account as a result of his over-reimbursements.<sup>[12]</sup></p>\n<p>Therefore, regardless of whether Noonan also made errors that, in the end, resulted in an ultimate windfall for Staples,<sup>[13]</sup> the evidence viewed in Noonan's favor still shows highly suspicious expense-reporting practices sufficient to ground a finding that Noonan intentionally manipulated at least some expense reports so that he would receive money he did not deserve. As Noonan repeatedly argues or intimates, Staples may have been wiser to conduct yet another, even more searching investigation into his conduct; to give him a second chance before firing him; to impose some less-severe form of discipline; or to punish other violators in the North American Divisionof whom Noonan claims there were manywith the same harsh penalty. Nevertheless, even indulging Noonan all reasonable inferences, we cannot say that Staples's decision that Noonan engaged in willful misconduct or willfully failed to perform his duties in its best interestbased as it was on the findings of experienced auditorswas arbitrary, capricious, or made in bad faith.</p>\n<p>For these reasons, there is no triable issue of material fact with respect to Staples's decision that cause existed to fire <span class=\"star-pagination\">*14</span> Noonan, and under the plain terms of the stock-option agreements, Staples was thus entitled to determine Noonan ineligible for the stock options. Accordingly, the district court did not err in granting summary judgment to Staples on Noonan's claims concerning the stock-option agreements, and we move on to his last ground of appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Breach of Severance Agreement</h2>\n<p>Lastly, Noonan contends that the district court erred in granting summary judgment to Staples on his claim that it violated the severance agreement. We need not dwell long on this ground of appeal because it is foreclosed by the plain terms of the relevant instruments. The severance agreement provided that Noonan would not receive his severance benefits if Staples terminated him \"for `[c]ause.'\" Another clause in the agreement provided that \"cause,\" for purposes of the severance agreement, includes a violation of Staples's Code of Ethics. The Code of Ethics, in turn, contained the following provision:</p>\n<blockquote>We expect you to keep accurate records and reports. . . . All company books, records, and accounts must be maintained in accordance with all applicable regulations and standards and accurately reflect the transactions they record. . . . We do not permit . . . false or misleading entries in the company's books or records for any reason. . . .</blockquote>\n<p>Even viewed in the light most favorable to Noonan, the evidence in the record readily shows that he failed to abide by this clause of the Code of Ethics.<sup>[14]</sup> As Staples suggests, even if all of Noonan's many expense-reporting discrepancies were simply careless mistakes or instances where he forgot to amend pre-populated entries after figuring out what the item actually cost, the mere fact that he deliberately created inaccurate entries through the practice of pre-population transgresses this provision. Thus, under the plain terms of the severance agreement, Noonan was fired for cause, as that term is specifically defined in that agreement. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Cabot Corp. v. AVX Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">448</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">629</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">863</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">503</span></span>, 513 (2007) (where a contract's language is unambiguous, its interpretation is a question of law that may be resolved on summary judgment); <i>Eigerman v.

The district court therefore acted properly in determining that Noonan forfeited his entitlement to severance benefits, and summary judgment in favor of Staples on this claim also must stand.<sup>[15]</sup></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Staples in all respects.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Noonan made two other claims that were also dismissed by the district court.

Given our holding below affirming the district court's grant of summary judgment on Noonan's libel claim due to the absence of the fourth element, we need not reach the question of whether the third and fifth elements are fulfilled on the record of this case.</p>\n<p>[3]  For this reason, we need not attempt to determine whose calculationsNoonan's or Staples'swere correct, or whether it was Noonan or Staples who received the ultimate windfall from Noonan's typographical and mathematical errors.</p>\n<p>[4]  Massachusetts courts engage in a similar inquiry when determining the second element of a libel claim  whether the statement is of or concerning the plaintiff. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Stanton,</i> 438 F.3d at 128 (\"Like the question of whether a communication can reasonably be understood to be defamatory, whether a communication can reasonably be understood to be of and concerning the plaintiff depends on the circumstances.\") (citing <i>New Eng. Tractor-Trailer of Conn., Inc. v. Globe Newspaper Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2146544\"><a href=\"/opinion/2146544/new-eng-tractor-trailer-training-v-globe-newspaper/\"><span class=\"volume\">395</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">471</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2146544\"><a href=\"/opinion/2146544/new-eng-tractor-trailer-training-v-globe-newspaper/\"><span class=\"volume\">480</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1005</span></a></span>, 1010 n. 5 (1985)).</p>\n<p>[5]  Thus, even though Noonan may dispute whether the investigation was, as the Baitler e-mail characterized it, \"thorough,\" this minor detail does not deprive the e-mail of its substantially true character.</p>\n<p>[6]  To the extent the brief discussion in <i>Perry v. Hearst Corp.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"265086\"><a href=\"/opinion/265086/mary-m-perry-v-the-hearst-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">334</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">800</span></a></span>, 801-02 (1st Cir. 1964), suggests a different outcome, we do not believe that such an outcome comports with Massachusetts law as it stands today.</p>\n<p>[7]  Older Massachusetts law, cited by Noonan, defined actual malice for a libel claim in the more traditional sense of hatred or ill-will. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Fay v. Harrington,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">176</span> <span class=\"reporter\">Mass.</span> <span class=\"page\">270</span></span>, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">57</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.</span> <span class=\"page\">369</span></span>, 371 (1900). This law has been superseded by the modern definition. <i>See</i> Richard W. Bishop, 17A <i>Mass. Practice</i> § 43.6 n. 5.</p>\n<p>[8]  The possibility that Staples may have destroyed the electronic version of the e-mail notwithstanding requests to preserve it does not compel a contrary result. This is so because the actual malice inquiry turns on the defendant's state of mind at the time it published the alleged libel, and it is undisputed that the Baitler e-mail's possible destruction took place several days after its publication.</p>\n<p>[9]  Because we conclude that no actionable libel was published in the first place, we need not reach the question of whether Staples nonetheless retained its conditional privilegea point argued at length by both parties.</p>\n<p>[10]  Noonan claims that we are bound by the <i>Patton</i> case, in which the Supreme Judicial Court held invalid a contractual clause giving a company president the sole authority to determine whether a fired employee would receive a deferred salary. <i>See </i><i>Patton,</i> 156 N.E. at 536. Yet Massachusetts courts strongly favor the freedom of contract absent serious misconduct or fraud. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>Sound Techniques, Inc. v. Hoffman,</i> 50 Mass.App.Ct. 425, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">737</span> <span class=\"reporter\">N.E.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">920</span></span>, 927 (2000). There is no evidence in the record that Noonan, a sophisticated party, was under duress when he signed onto the stock-option agreements, or that the agreements suffered from some other infirmity invalidating their plain terms. In any event, <i>Patton</i> dates from 1927, and we do not think the Court would take the same view today when faced with a modern stock-option agreement like the two at issue here.</p>\n<p>[11]  At another point in its brief, Staples concedes that its cause decision must have been made in good faith, and that we have the authority to review the decision at least to that extent.</p>\n<p>[12]  Another relevant factor is that Staples's termination letter to Noonan told him that he was being fired for cause. <i>See </i><i>Hammond v. T.J. Litle &amp; Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"717545\"><a href=\"/opinion/717545/scott-p-hammond-v-tj-litle-company-inc-cross-appellee/\"><span class=\"volume\">82</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1166</span></a></span>, 1175 (1st Cir. 1996) (applying Massachusetts law and remarking that \"when an employee may only be terminated for cause, whether the employer so informs the employee plays a decisive role in a court's later determination of whether the employee was discharged for cause\").</p>\n<p>[13]  As noted above, the parties vigorously dispute which party received the ultimate windfall. We need not determine who is correct on this question in order to resolve the issues presented in this appeal. <i>See supra</i> note 3.</p>\n<p>[14]  The quoted language comes from the 2005 version of the Code of Ethics. Noonan seems to argue that he was bound by the 2001 version of the Code; Staples asserts that he was bound by the 2005 version. We need not decide which party is correct, as the relevant language in the 2001 version is identical.</p>\n<p>[15]  We add that the 2004 Stock-Option Agreement (but not the 1992 Stock-Option Agreement) also included violation of the Code of Ethics as a ground constituting \"cause.\" Summary judgment in favor of Staples with respect to that agreement could therefore have been affirmed for this reason as an alternative to the ground discussed above.</p>\n\n</div>",
