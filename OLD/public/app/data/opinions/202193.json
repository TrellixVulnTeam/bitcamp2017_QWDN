R. 32.3\n\n             United States Court of Appeals\n                           For the First Circuit\n\nNo. 05-1805\n\n                         UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n                                 Appellee,\n\n                                         v.\n\n                               ANTONIO MATEO,\n                            Defendant, Appellant.\n\n\n             APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n                     FOR THE DISTRICT OF PUERTO RICO\n\n           [Hon. Juan M. Pérez-Giménez, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                      Before\n\n                            Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n                       Hug,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                        and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n\n     Laura Maldonado Rodriguez for appellant.\n     Nelson Pérez-Sousa, Assistant United States Attorney, Senior\nAppellate Attorney, United States Attorney's Office, with whom\nH.S. Garcia, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                                   May 5, 2006\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Ninth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f           Per     Curiam.         Antonio     Mateo    brings    this    appeal   to\n\nchallenge the sentence imposed on him after he pleaded guilty to\n\nbeing   found    within      the    United     States    without    authorization\n\nfollowing his removal or deportation as an alien convicted of an\n\naggravated felony.     See 8 U.S.C. § 1326(b)(2).            Mateo says that the\n\ndistrict   court    erred     in    sentencing     him    above    the    applicable\n\nguideline sentencing range without providing him with pre-hearing\n\nnotice of the contemplated ground for that action.                       Cf. Fed. R.\n\nCrim. P. 32(h) (\"Before the court may depart from the applicable\n\nsentencing range on a ground not identified for departure either in\n\nthe presentence report or in a party's prehearing submission, the\n\ncourt   must    give   the     parties       reasonable    notice    that     it   is\n\ncontemplating such a departure. The notice must specify any ground\n\non which the court is contemplating a departure.\").                       Mateo was\n\nsentenced after the Supreme Court's decision in United States v.\n\nBooker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005), so he is implicitly asking us to\n\nhold that a sentence outside the applicable guidelines sentencing\n\nrange either constitutes a \"departure\" for purposes of Rule 32(h)\n\nor should, at least, be subject to the same notice rule.\n\n           The issue is interesting, but we could not vacate Mateo's\n\nsentence, whether or not we agree with his reading of the Rule.\n\nMateo did not object to the absence of notice before the district\n\ncourt, so our review is for plain error, see United States v.\n\nMangone, 105 F.3d 29, 35 (1st Cir. 1997), unless Mateo was not\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fafforded a sufficient opportunity to present to the district court\n\nthe argument which forms the basis of this appeal, see United\n\nStates v. Cortes-Claudio, 312 F.3d 17, 24 (1st Cir. 2002); United\n\nStates v. Gallant, 306 F.3d 1181, 1188-89 (1st Cir. 2002).              Mateo\n\ncites to Cortes-Claudio, but he makes no developed argument that he\n\nwas placed in a similar situation.           See United States v. Zannino,\n\n895 F.2d 1, 17 (1st Cir. 1990).              Moreover, Mateo did have an\n\nopportunity to discuss with the court the appropriateness of his\n\nsentence after its imposition. Under the circumstances, our review\n\nis for plain error pursuant to Fed. R. Crim. P. 52(b).\n\n           Under Rule 52(b), we are empowered to correct the alleged\n\nerror only if it was \"plain,\"           which requires that the error be\n\n\"clear under current law.\"       United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725,\n\n734 (1993).    Here, no such claim can be made.          Neither the Supreme\n\nCourt nor this court has ruled on whether and to what extent the\n\nnotice requirement of Rule 32(h) survives Booker, and the circuits\n\nthat have discussed the issue have reached varying conclusions.\n\nCompare, e.g., United States v. Long Soldier, 431 F.3d 1120, 1122\n\n(8th Cir. 2005) (post-Booker, the Rule 32(h) notice requirement\n\ndoes not apply to a \"variance\" above the applicable guidelines\n\nsentencing range); United States v. Simmerer, No. 05-11144 (11th\n\nCir. Nov. 16, 2005) (unpublished opinion) (post-Booker, failure to\n\ngive   prior   notice   under   Rule    32(h)   of   a   contemplated   upward\n\n\"variance\" from the guidelines sentencing range is not plain\n\n\n                                       -3-\n\ferror), with, e.g., United States v. Davenport, __ F.3d __, 2006 WL\n\n1044476, at *4 (4th Cir. April 21, 2006) (notice of intent to\n\ndepart     or    vary   from       guidelines    remains   a   critical     part   of\n\nsentencing);       United States v. Dozier, __ F.3d __, 2006 WL 864877,\n\nat *2 (10th Cir. Apr. 5, 2006) (\"Rule 32(h) survives Booker and\n\nrequires a court to notify both parties of any intention to depart\n\nfrom the advisory sentencing guidelines as well as the basis for\n\nsuch   a   departure        when    the   ground   is   not    identified    in    the\n\npresentence report or in a party's prehearing submission\"); United\n\nStates v.
