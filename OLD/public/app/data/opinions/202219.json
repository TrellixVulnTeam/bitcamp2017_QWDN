Robert Goodrich appeals from the\n\ndistrict court's denial of his petition for habeas corpus relief\n\nunder 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254.       That court granted Goodrich a certificate\n\nof appealability providing for review of the question of \"[w]hether\n\n[Goodrich] was denied his due process rights under the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment of the United States Constitution when knowingly false\n\ntestimony was presented before the state grand jury and [Goodrich]\n\nwas unlawfully indicted as a result thereof.\" We affirm the denial\n\nof the petition.\n\n          Goodrich was convicted in Massachusetts after a jury\n\ntrial in January 2001 of armed robbery and was sentenced to ten to\n\nfifteen years' imprisonment.         Goodrich, in August 1999, had snuck\n\ninto the office of a used car dealership just as Yajun Yang, who\n\nknew Goodrich, was locking up for the night.1          Goodrich stuck a gun\n\ninto Yang's ribs, robbed him of $200, and forced him into the trunk\n\nof a car, where he left him.\n\n          In    December     2002,   the    state   Appeals   Court   affirmed\n\nGoodrich's     conviction,    rejecting      his    sole   claim   that   \"the\n\nindictment against him should have been dismissed because the\n\nCommonwealth presented improper testimony before the grand jury.\"\n\nCommonwealth v. Goodrich, 779 N.E.2d 1004, 2002 WL 31730244, at *1\n\n(Mass. App. Ct. 2002) (unpublished table decision).                The Supreme\n\n\n\n     1\n      Goodrich is described in some parts of the record as an \"ex-\nemployee\" of the dealership.\n\n                                      -2-\n\fJudicial Court (SJC) denied his application for leave to obtain\n\nfurther     appellate    review      (ALOFAR)    on     January    22,     2003.\n\nCommonwealth v. Goodrich, 782 N.E.2d 1083 (Mass. 2003) (unpublished\n\ntable decision).     Goodrich filed his petition for a writ of habeas\n\ncorpus in federal court on December 17, 2003, and this was denied\n\non its merits on March 11, 2005.\n\n            The gist of the habeas claim is that the prosecution had\n\nimproperly offered evidence at the grand jury proceeding which was\n\nso egregious as to require dismissal of the indictment. The theory\n\nis that dismissal was required despite the facts that the petit\n\njury convicted Goodrich after a trial and that the petit jury was\n\nunaware of the testimony before the grand jury about which Goodrich\n\ncomplains. Goodrich asserts that no grand jury would have indicted\n\nhim save for the improper evidence, and that this means the\n\nindictment should have been dismissed; thus, his conviction is\n\ninvalid, and habeas relief is required.\n\n            The alleged impropriety was that a detective had read to\n\nthe grand jury the police report of one of the officers who had\n\narrived at the scene.      According to the detective's testimony, the\n\npolice report stated that Yang said that he \"only knows the suspect\n\n[an ex-employee] as Bob, and that approximately two months ago the\n\nsame employee stole $12,000 from him.\"           A grand juror inquired of\n\nthe detective, \"You said something about there were two robberies;\n\none   for   $200   and   one   for   $12,000?\"        The   detective    replied\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\faccurately that that was \"what the victim was telling us.\"                    But\n\nthen he went on to say, \"We learned later that this had apparently\n\ntaken place\" outside the jurisdiction of his police department.\n\nThe prosecutor interceded and instructed the grand jurors to\n\ndisregard    the   information    pertaining    to   the    alleged    $12,000\n\nrobbery, to strike it from their minds, and to focus on the\n\nincident in which the $200 was stolen.\n\n            Goodrich insists that he was never indicted for any\n\n$12,000 robbery (or even accused of such a robbery other than as\n\ndescribed above), and the Commonwealth does not argue otherwise.\n\nGoodrich argues that the prosecutor, seeking to portray Goodrich as\n\na habitual robber, knowingly presented false testimony to the grand\n\njury; that this ploy succeeded in prejudicing the grand jury; and\n\nthat the resulting indictment and ultimate conviction violated his\n\nFourteenth Amendment right to due process.\n\n            The familiar litany of analysis of habeas petitions is\n\ngoverned by the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act\n\n(AEDPA),    28   U.S.C.   ยง   2254,   and   judicially     created    rules    of\n\nrestraint. There is no dispute that the petition was timely filed,\n\nwithin the statutory limits.          See id. ยง 2244(d)(1)(A) (providing\n\nfor one-year period of limitation, running from the latest of,\n\ninter alia, \"the date on which the judgment became final by the\n\nconclusion of direct review,\" for habeas applications by state\n\nprisoners).\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\f             The next question is whether Goodrich had exhausted his\n\nstate remedies by having first presented the federal constitutional\n\nissue   to    the   state    courts   for    their    decision.        See   id.\n\nยง   2254(b),(c);    Picard    v.   Connor,    404    U.S.   270,    275   (1971)\n\n(discussing exhaustion principle).           We review this issue de novo.\n\nBarresi v. Maloney, 296 F.3d 48, 51 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n             This circuit's rules about what constitutes presenting a\n\nfederal issue are fairly generous.              See id. (stating that \"a\n\npetitioner need not express his federal claims in precisely the\n\nsame terms in both the state and federal courts\").                 We have said\n\nthat the \"ways in which a petitioner might satisfy his or her\n\nobligation to fairly present a federal constitutional issue to a\n\nstate's highest court\" are \"myriad,\" and we have listed examples,\n\nsuch as \"(1) citing a specific provision of the Constitution; (2)\n\npresenting the substance of a federal constitutional claim in such\n\nmanner that it likely alerted the state court to the claim's\n\nfederal nature; (3) reliance on federal constitutional precedents;\n\nand (4) claiming a particular right specifically guaranteed by the\n\nConstitution.\"      Id. at 52 (quoting Gagne v. Fair, 835 F.2d 6, 7\n\n(1st Cir. 1987)). The exhaustion requirement can also be satisfied\n\nwhere \"[a]n individual's claim, arising under and asserted in terms\n\nof state law, . . . as a practical matter, [is] indistinguishable\n\nfrom one arising under federal law.\" Id. (internal quotation marks\n\n\n\n\n                                      -5-\n\fomitted) (quoting Nadworny v. Fair, 872 F.2d 1093, 1099 (1st Cir.\n\n1989)).\n\n          In his brief before the state Appeals Court, Goodrich\n\nexpressly relied on the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States\n\nConstitution, explicitly invoked its Due Process Clause, and cited\n\nto apposite federal cases, including United States v. Basurto, 497\n\nF.2d 781 (9th Cir. 1974).\n\n          What makes this question of exhaustion close is that the\n\nonly decisions cited in Goodrich's ALOFAR are state decisions.\n\nHowever, Goodrich primarily relied in the ALOFAR on a state case\n\ninvoking federal due process as to an alleged error in the grand\n\njury proceedings.   See Commonwealth v. Kelcourse, 535 N.E.2d 1272,\n\n1273 (Mass. 1989) (defendant argued that prosecutor's statement to\n\ngrand jury violated, inter alia, \"his Fourteenth Amendment right to\n\ndue process\" (citing Hicks v. Oklahoma, 447 U.S. 343, 345-47\n\n(1980))). Furthermore, Goodrich's ALOFAR did explicitly frame both\n\nhis \"Statement of Points with Respect to Which Further Appellate\n\nReview is Sought\" and his \"Statement of Argument\" in terms of a\n\nviolation of \"Amendment XIV,\" by which he appears to have meant the\n\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (and also in\n\nterms of a violation of a state constitutional provision).\n\n          Taking into account the background of Goodrich's more\n\nexplicit federal argument before the state Appeals Court, the\n\nabsence of any sign that Goodrich abandoned his federal claim in\n\n\n                                -6-\n\fthe ALOFAR, and the nature of the argument in the ALOFAR (which is\n\nstrikingly similar to, and indeed largely a verbatim copy of, the\n\nAppeals Court brief), see Barresi, 296 F.3d at 52 n.1 (\"If it\n\ncannot be said that the petitioner abandoned his or her federal\n\nclaims on appeal to the SJC, federal exhaustion review includes\n\nconsideration       of    the   petitioner's   lower     court    filings   as    a\n\n'backdrop'     to   his    or   her   ALOFAR.\"),    we   think    it   likely    \"a\n\nreasonable jurist would recognize the [federal] constitutional\n\ndimensions of the petitioner's claims.\"             Id. at 52.\n\n          The federal due process claims having been exhausted, the\n\nnext question is which standard of review to apply.                Under AEDPA,\n\nfederal courts may not grant habeas relief \"'with respect to any\n\nclaim   that    was      adjudicated    on    the   merits   in    State    court\n\nproceedings' unless the state court decision\" meets either of two\n\ncriteria: \"1) [it] 'was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable\n\napplication of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by\n\nthe Supreme Court of the United States' or 2) [it] 'was based on an\n\nunreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence\n\npresented in the State court proceeding.'\"               McCambridge v. Hall,\n\n303 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir. 2002) (en banc) (citations omitted)\n\n(quoting 28 U.S.C. ยง 2254(d)).         In this circuit, if the state court\n\nhas not adjudicated the federal claim on the merits, then we do not\n\nask whether the decision involved an unreasonable application of\n\nfederal law, but instead review the constitutional question de\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fnovo.   See id. at 35; see also Fortini v. Murphy, 257 F.3d 39, 47\n\n(1st Cir. 2001) (observing that \"we can hardly defer to the state\n\ncourt on an issue that the state court did not address\").   Here, it\n\ndoes not matter which standard of review we apply, for the outcome\n\nis the same.\n\n           The Commonwealth argues that our analysis should then\n\nproceed, in priority, to ask the question of whether Goodrich's\n\nclaim is barred because, under Teague v. Lane, 489 U.S. 288 (1989),\n\nit could only succeed if this court were to articulate a \"new\n\nconstitutional rule[] of criminal procedure,\" and because such a\n\nrule (unless it comes within an exception) may not be applied to\n\ncases, such as this one, \"which have become final before the new\n\nrule[] [is] announced.\"    Id. at 310 (plurality opinion).    It is\n\nclear that a Teague analysis would be required before a federal\n\ncourt may grant a habeas petition.     Horn v. Banks, 536 U.S. 266,\n\n267, 371-72 (2002) (per curiam); Caspari v. Bohlen, 510 U.S. 383,\n\n389, 396-97 (1994).   The reverse is not true.   This court has held\n\nthat where a habeas petition can easily be denied on other grounds,\n\nthere is no need to do a Teague analysis first.          Campiti v.\n\nMatesanz, 333 F.3d 317, 321-22 (1st Cir. 2003); accord Townes v.\n\nMurray, 68 F.3d 840, 847-48 (4th Cir. 1995); Eaglin v. Welborn, 57\n\nF.3d 496, 499 (7th Cir. 1995) (en banc).\n\n           There are practical reasons not to perform a Teague\n\nanalysis in this sort of case.    Habeas proceedings are, by their\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fnature, procedurally complicated, and there is no reason, once a\n\nhabeas petition is properly before a federal court, to add to the\n\ncomplexity by requiring analysis of complicated issues, when a\n\nsimpler solution is at hand.          See Campiti, 333 F.3d at 321-22.\n\nThere is a strong interest expressed by Congress in AEDPA in\n\nexpediting the handling of habeas petitions, an interest which\n\nwould be disrupted by requiring unnecessary analyses.            We realize\n\nthe state may waive a Teague issue by not presenting it.                   See\n\nSchiro v. Farley, 510 U.S. 222, 229 (1994); see also Caspari, 510\n\nU.S. at 389 (\"[A] federal court may, but need not, decline to apply\n\nTeague if the State does not argue it.\").            That does not mean a\n\ncourt must resolve the Teague issue simply because the state does\n\nraise it.    Moreover, here, any resolution of the very fact-based\n\nquestion would not provide a useful black-letter rule helpful in\n\nfuture cases.\n\n            We skip the Teague analysis and turn to the merits.\n\nAlthough    \"there   is   no   constitutional   requirement    that    States\n\ninstitute prosecutions by means of an indictment returned by a\n\ngrand jury,\" that fact \"does not relieve those States that do\n\nemploy   grand   juries   from    complying   with   the   commands   of   the\n\nFourteenth Amendment in the operation of those juries.\"               Rose v.\n\nMitchell, 443 U.S. 545, 557 n.7 (1979) (citation omitted).                 The\n\ndistrict court's cogent analysis on the merits explains well why\n\nGoodrich's claim fails.          We add that the Supreme Court has not\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fdefined the circumstances in which impropriety involving even a\n\nfederal grand jury can ever lead to dismissal of an indictment once\n\na petit jury has returned a verdict of guilt.         See United States v.\n\nMechanik, 475 U.S. 66, 73 (1986) (\"[T]he petit jury's verdict\n\nrendered harmless any conceivable error in the charging decision\n\nthat might have flowed from the violation [of a Federal Rule of\n\nCriminal Procedure].\").        But those circumstances, as this court\n\nrecently noted, are \"very rare,\" even when there has not been a\n\npetit jury verdict of conviction -- and all the more so when there\n\nhas.   In re United States, 441 F.3d 44, 60 (1st Cir. 2006).           The\n\ncircumstances     justifying    dismissal    of    the   indictment   after\n\nconviction must be so severe, the prosecutorial misconduct so\n\n\"blatant,\" as to \"call[] into doubt the fundamental fairness of the\n\njudicial process.\"      United States v. Ortiz de Jesus, 230 F.3d 1, 4\n\n(1st Cir. 2000); see also United States v. Reyes-Echevarria, 345\n\nF.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir. 2003) (upholding district court's refusal to\n\ndismiss indictment).\n\n             Where a defendant seeks dismissal of the indictment\n\nbefore there is a petit jury verdict, such relief \"is appropriate\n\nonly   'if   it   is   established   that   the   violation   substantially\n\ninfluenced the grand jury's decision to indict,' or if there is\n\n'grave doubt' that the decision to indict was free from the\n\nsubstantial influence of such violations.\"          Bank of Nova Scotia v.\n\nUnited States, 487 U.S. 250, 256 (1988) (quoting Mechanik, 475 U.S.\n\n\n                                     -10-\n\fat 78 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment)).   Further, \"[a]n\n\nindictment returned by a legally constituted and unbiased grand\n\njury, . . . if valid on its face, is enough to call for trial of\n\nthe charge on the merits.\"2   Costello v. United States, 350 U.S.\n\n359, 363 (1956).\n\n            Measured against this standard, petitioner's claim is\n\nwithout merit.   Even assuming the detective's testimony before the\n\ngrand jury went too far, any misstep by the detective in his\n\ntestimony was corrected by the prosecutor, and there is no reason\n\nto think Goodrich would not have been indicted anyway.   The final\n\nstraw is that the petit jury was unaware of the allegedly improper\n\ntestimony and its verdict is unassailable.\n\n            The dismissal of the petition for habeas corpus is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      Despite Goodrich's strenuous assertions that this is not the\n\"usual\" case, it is clear that we are not dealing here with a\ndefect in the grand jury proceedings that (assuming it even\noccurred) might be regarded as a special case. Cf. Bank of Nova\nScotia, 487 U.S. at 257 (noting that \"racial discrimination in\nselection of grand jurors\" is a special case); Mechanik, 475 U.S.\nat 70 n.1 (same).\n\n                                -11-\n\f",

Basurto,</i> 497 F.2d 781 (9th Cir.1974).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">What makes this question of exhaustion close is that the only decisions cited in Goodrich's ALOFAR are state decisions. However, Goodrich primarily relied in the ALOFAR on a state case invoking federal due process as to an alleged error in the grand jury proceedings. <i>See Commonwealth v. Kelcourse,</i> 404 Mass. 466, 535 N.E.2d 1272, 1273 (1989) (defendant argued that prosecutor's statement to grand jury violated, inter alia, \"his Fourteenth Amendment right to due process\" (citing <i>Hicks v. Oklahoma,</i> 447 U.S. 343, 345-47, 100 S.Ct. 2227, 65 L.Ed.2d 175 (1980))). Furthermore, Goodrich's ALOFAR did explicitly frame both his \"Statement of Points with Respect to Which Further Appellate Review is Sought\" and his \"Statement of Argument\" in terms of a violation of \"Amendment XIV,\" by which he appears to have meant the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (and also in terms of a violation of a state constitutional provision).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking into account the background of Goodrich's more explicit federal argument before the state Appeals Court, the absence of any sign that Goodrich abandoned his federal claim in the ALOFAR, and the nature of the argument in the ALOFAR (which is strikingly similar to, and indeed largely a verbatim copy of, the Appeals Court brief), <i>see Barresi,</i> 296 F.3d at 52 n. 1 (\"If it cannot be said that the petitioner abandoned his or her federal claims on appeal to the SJC, federal exhaustion review includes consideration of the petitioner's lower court filings as a `backdrop' to his or her ALOFAR.\"), we think it likely \"a reasonable jurist would recognize the [federal] constitutional dimensions of the petitioner's claims.\" <i>Id.</i> at 52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal due process claims having been exhausted, the next question is which standard of review to apply. Under AEDPA, federal courts may not grant habeas relief \"`with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings' unless the state court decision\" meets either of two criteria: \"1) [it] `was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States' or 2)[it] `was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.'\" <i>McCambridge v. Hall,</i> 303 F.3d 24, 34 (1st Cir.2002) (en banc) (citations omitted) (quoting 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2254(d)). In this circuit, if the state court has not adjudicated the federal claim on the merits, then we do not ask whether the decision involved an unreasonable application of federal law, but instead review the constitutional question de novo. <i>See id.</i> at 35; <i>see also Fortini v. Murphy,</i> 257 F.3d 39, 47 (1st Cir.2001) (observing that \"we can hardly defer to the state court on an issue that the state court did not address\"). Here, it does not matter which standard of review we apply, for the outcome is the same.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Commonwealth argues that our analysis should then proceed, in priority, to ask the question of whether Goodrich's claim is barred because, under <i>Teague v. Lane,</i> 489 U.S. 288, 109 S.Ct. 1060, 103 L.Ed.2d 334 (1989), it could only succeed if this court were to articulate a \"new constitutional rule[] of criminal procedure,\" and because such a rule (unless it comes within an exception) may not be applied to cases, such as this one, \"which have become final before the new rule[][is] announced.\" <i>Id.</i> at 310, 109 S.Ct. 1060 (plurality opinion). It is clear that a <i>Teague</i> analysis would be required before a federal court may grant a habeas petition. <i>Horn v. Banks,</i> 536 U.S. 266, 267, 271-72, 122 S.Ct. 2147, 153 L.Ed.2d 301 (2002) (per curiam); <i>Caspari v. Bohlen,</i> 510 U.S. 383, 389, 396-97, 114 S.Ct. 948, 127 L.Ed.2d 236 (1994). The reverse is not true. This court has held that where a habeas petition can easily be denied on other grounds, there is no need to do a <i>Teague</i> analysis first. <i>Campiti v. Matesanz,</i> 333 F.3d 317, 321-22 (1st Cir.2003); <i>accord Townes v. Murray,</i> 68 F.3d 840, 847-48 (4th Cir. 1995); <i>Eaglin v. Welborn,</i> 57 F.3d 496, 499 (7th Cir.1995) (en banc).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are practical reasons not to perform a <i>Teague</i> analysis in this sort of case. Habeas proceedings are, by their nature, procedurally complicated, and there is no reason, once a habeas petition is properly before a federal court, to add to the complexity by requiring analysis of complicated issues, when a simpler solution is at hand. <i>See Campiti,</i> 333 F.3d at 321-22. There is a strong interest expressed by Congress in AEDPA in expediting the handling of habeas petitions, an interest which would be disrupted by requiring unnecessary analyses. We realize the state may waive a <i>Teague</i> issue by not presenting it. <i>See Schiro v. Farley,</i> 510 U.S. 222, 229, 114 S.Ct. 783, 127 L.Ed.2d 47 (1994); <i>see also Caspari,</i> 510 U.S. at 389, 114 S.Ct. 948 (\"[A] federal court may, but need not, decline to apply <i>Teague</i> if the State does not argue it.\"). That does not mean a court must resolve the <i>Teague</i> issue simply because the state does raise it. Moreover, here, any resolution of the very fact-based question would not provide a useful black-letter rule helpful in future cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We skip the <i>Teague</i> analysis and turn to the merits. Although \"there is no constitutional requirement that States institute prosecutions by means of an indictment returned by a grand jury,\" that fact \"does not relieve those States that do employ grand juries from complying with the commands of the Fourteenth Amendment in the operation of those juries.\" <i>Rose v. Mitchell,</i> 443 U.S. 545, 557 n. 7, 99 S.Ct. 2993, 61 L.Ed.2d 739 (1979) (citation omitted). The district court's cogent analysis on the merits explains well why Goodrich's claim fails. We add that the Supreme Court has not defined the circumstances in which impropriety involving even a federal grand jury can ever lead to dismissal of an indictment once a petit jury has returned a verdict of guilt. <i>See United States v. Mechanik,</i> 475 U.S. 66, 73, 106 S.Ct. 938, 89 L.Ed.2d 50 (1986) (\"[T]he petit jury's verdict rendered harmless any conceivable error in the charging decision that might have flowed from the violation [of a Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure].\"). But those circumstances, as this court recently noted, are \"very rare,\" even when there has not been a petit jury verdict of conviction-and all the more so when there has. <i>In re United States,</i> 441 F.3d 44, 60 (1st Cir.2006). The circumstances justifying dismissal of the indictment after conviction must be so severe, the prosecutorial misconduct so \"blatant,\" as to \"call[] into doubt the fundamental fairness of the judicial process.\" <i>United States v. Ortiz de Jesus,</i> 230 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.2000); <i>see also United States v. Reyes-Echevarria,</i> 345 F.3d 1, 4-5 (1st Cir.2003) (upholding district court's refusal to dismiss indictment).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a defendant seeks dismissal of the indictment before there is a petit jury verdict, such relief \"is appropriate only `if it is established that the violation substantially influenced the grand jury's decision to indict,' or if there is `grave doubt' that the decision to indict was free from the substantial influence of such violations.\" <i>Bank of Nova Scotia v. United States,</i> 487 U.S. 250, 256, 108 S.Ct. 2369, 101 L.Ed.2d 228 (1988) (quoting <i>Mechanik,</i> 475 U.S. at 78, 106 S.Ct. 938 (O'Connor, J., concurring in the judgment)).

Furthermore, Goodrich's ALOFAR did explicitly frame both his \"Statement of Points with Respect to Which Further Appellate Review is Sought\" and his \"Statement of Argument\" in terms of a violation of \"Amendment XIV,\" by which he appears to have meant the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution (and also in terms of a violation of a state constitutional provision).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Taking into account the background of Goodrich's more explicit federal argument before the state Appeals Court, the absence of any sign that Goodrich abandoned his federal claim in the ALOFAR, and the nature of the argument in the ALOFAR (which is strikingly similar to, and indeed largely a verbatim copy of, the Appeals Court brief), <i>see Barresi,</i> 296 F.3d at 52 n. 1 (\"If it cannot be said that the petitioner abandoned his or her federal claims on appeal to the SJC, federal exhaustion review includes consideration of the petitioner's lower court filings as a `backdrop' to his or her ALOFAR.\"), we think it likely \"a reasonable jurist would recognize the [federal] constitutional dimensions of the petitioner's claims.\" <i>Id.</i> at 52.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The federal due process claims having been exhausted, the next question is which standard of review to apply. Under AEDPA, federal courts may not grant habeas relief \"`with respect to any claim that was adjudicated on the merits in State court proceedings' unless the state court decision\" meets either of two criteria: \"1) [it] `was contrary to, or involved an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court of the United States' or 2)[it] `was based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.'\" <i>McCambridge v.

In this circuit, if the state court has not adjudicated the federal claim on the merits, then we do not ask whether the decision involved an unreasonable application of federal law, but instead review the constitutional question de novo. <i>See id.</i> at 35; <i>see also Fortini v.

Habeas proceedings are, by their nature, procedurally complicated, and there is no reason, once a habeas petition is properly before a federal court, to add to the complexity by requiring analysis of complicated issues, when a simpler solution is at hand. <i>See Campiti,</i> 333 F.3d at 321-22. There is a strong interest expressed by Congress in AEDPA in expediting the handling of habeas petitions, an interest which would be disrupted by requiring unnecessary analyses. We realize the state may waive a <i>Teague</i> issue by not presenting it. <i>See Schiro v.

That does not mean a court must resolve the <i>Teague</i> issue simply because the state does raise it. Moreover, here, any resolution of the very fact-based question would not provide a useful black-letter rule helpful in future cases.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We skip the <i>Teague</i> analysis and turn to the merits. Although \"there is no constitutional requirement that States institute prosecutions by means of an indictment returned by a grand jury,\" that fact \"does not relieve those States that do employ grand juries from complying with the commands of the Fourteenth Amendment in the operation of those juries.\" <i>Rose v.

We add that the Supreme Court has not defined the circumstances in which impropriety involving even a federal grand jury can ever lead to dismissal of an indictment once a petit jury has returned a verdict of guilt. <i>See United States v.
