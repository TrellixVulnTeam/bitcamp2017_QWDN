R. 32.3\n\n\n           United States Court of Appeals\n                        For the First Circuit\n\n\nNo. 03-1490\n\n                               WILLIAM SMITH,\n\n                          Plaintiff, Appellant,\n\n                                       v.\n\n                 FORTIS BENEFITS INSURANCE COMPANY,\n\n                          Defendant, Appellee.\n\n\n\n           APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                 FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n           [Hon. Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n\n                                    Before\n\n               Torruella and Howard, Circuit Judges,\n               and Schwarzer,* Senior District Judge.\n\n\n\n\n     James F. Lafrance, with whom Normandin, Cheney & O'Neil was on\nbrief, for appellant.\n     Joshua Bachrach, with whom Rawle & Henderson LLP, was on\nbrief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                              October 9, 2003\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Northern District of California, sitting by designation.\n\f            Per Curiam.   William Smith (\"Smith\") appeals from the\n\ndistrict court's grant of summary judgment affirming the denial of\n\ndisability benefits under the Employee Retirement Income Security\n\nAct (\"ERISA\"), 29 U.S.C. ยง 1132(a)(1).            We affirm the district\n\ncourt's judgment for the reasons stated by the district judge in\n\nhis Memorandum and Order.    Smith v. Fortis Benefits Ins. Co., No.\n\nCiv. 02-55-B (D.N.H. Mar. 6, 2003) (Barbadoro, C.J.).          We outline\n\na few points relevant to appellant's claims.\n\n            As the relevant facts are set out in the district court's\n\nMemorandum and Order, we give only the essentials.              Smith was\n\nemployed as a project/test electronics engineer at New England\n\nSemiconductor (\"NES\").    Smith sought benefits from Fortis Benefits\n\nInsurance Company (\"Fortis\") in December 1999 under their Long Term\n\nDisability Plan (\"the Plan\") after suffering a heart attack.\n\nFortis denied Smith's application for long term disability benefits\n\nfinding Smith's medical limitations did not prevent him from\n\nperforming any of the material duties of his position.                 Smith\n\nexhausted   his   administrative   appeals   in    September   2000,    when\n\nFortis's Appeals Committee denied his appeal based on a finding\n\nthat he was capable of working at light to sedentary levels.\n\n            The district court granted Fortis's motion for summary\n\njudgment, finding that there was substantial evidence reasonably\n\nsufficient to support Fortis's decision.            We review grants of\n\nsummary judgment de novo, applying the same standard of review to\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fthe   administrative      determination        that   was    appropriate      in    the\n\ndistrict court.      See Leahy v. Raytheon Co., 315 F.3d 11, 18 (1st\n\nCir. 2002).\n\n            Appellant's main assertion is that the district court\n\nerred in applying the arbitrary and capricious standard to his\n\nclaims, because Fortis allegedly had a conflict of interest.                        The\n\nPlan states that Fortis \"has the sole discretionary authority to\n\ndetermine   eligibility      for    participation           or    benefits    and    to\n\ninterpret   the    terms    of    the    Policy.      All        determinations     and\n\ninterpretations made by [Fortis] are conclusive and binding on all\n\nparties.\"     Appellant contends this clause creates a conflict of\n\ninterest and, under Leahy, 315 F.3d at 16, and Doyle v. Paul Revere\n\nLife Ins. Co., 144 F.3d 181, 184 (1st Cir. 1998), we are required\n\nto apply a heightened standard to Smith's claim.\n\n            We    agree    with    the    district     court        that   Smith    is\n\noverreaching.     First, there is no indication of the type of actual\n\nconflict that we counseled against in Leahy and Doyle.                       In Pari-\n\nFasano v. ITT Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., 230 F.3d 415, 418\n\n(1st Cir. 2000), we held that the arbitrary and capricious standard\n\nis not altered by a potential conflict of interest.                    Instead, \"we\n\n[take] into account the potential for conflict in considering\n\nwhether the insurer's decision had strayed outside the bounds of\n\nreasonableness to become an abuse of discretion.\"                    Id. at 419.     We\n\n\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fcan   discern      neither   a    conflict    of   interest   nor    an   abuse   of\n\ndiscretion in Smith's case.\n\n              The rest of appellant's arguments cannot be successful.\n\nThe Supreme Court has held that the treating physician rule, which\n\nappellant urged be applied to him, does not apply in ERISA cases.\n\nSee Black & Decker Disability Plan v. Nord, ___ U.S. ___, 123 S.\n\nCt. 1965, 1972 (2003).           In addition, appellant urges us to reverse\n\nthe district court because Fortis did not give due deference to the\n\nSocial Security Administration's decision that he was disabled. We\n\nhave stated that these decisions should not be given controlling\n\nweight.   Lopes v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 332 F.3d 1, 6 n.9 (1st Cir.\n\n2003)(quoting Pari-Fasano, 230 F.3d at 420). Nor is there merit in\n\nSmith's argument that Fortis erroneously classified Smith's duties\n\nas    light   or    sedentary.       Substantial      evidence      supports   that\n\ndetermination.\n\n              For the foregoing reasons, the district court's grant of\n\nsummary judgment is affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\f",
