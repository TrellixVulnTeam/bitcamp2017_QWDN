D. Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                     Stafford,* District Judge,\n                   and Torruella, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Karen A. Pickett, with whom Donnelly, Conroy & Gelhaar, LLP\nwas on brief for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Appellate Chief, with whom Paula D.\nSilsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                        September 10, 2008\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation.\n\f            TORRUELLA, Circuit Judge.         Carlos Torres pled guilty to\n\npossession   of    crack   cocaine    with   intent    to    distribute.       The\n\nPresentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\") determined him to be a\n\ncareer offender under the Sentencing Guidelines, resulting in a\n\nGuidelines Sentencing Range (\"GSR\") of 188 to 235 months.                  Counted\n\nfor career-offender purposes were two New Jersey convictions -- one\n\nfor drug distribution and one for possessing an assault weapon --\n\nthat Torres committed at age seventeen, and for which he was\n\nconvicted    and   sentenced    at    age    twenty.        On   appeal,   Torres\n\nchallenges his qualification as a career offender by arguing that\n\nthese convictions were not properly countable because he was a\n\njuvenile when he committed them, and that the gun-possession\n\noffense was not a \"crime of violence,\" as required under the\n\napplicable guideline.      He also argues that he must be resentenced\n\nto take account of recent Guidelines amendments concerning crack\n\ncocaine.    After careful review, we affirm Torres's sentence.\n\n                               I.    Background\n\n            Torres sold 10.1 grams of crack cocaine to an undercover\n\nagent.   He was arrested and charged with distributing five or more\n\ngrams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), an\n\noffense carrying a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of five\n\nyears and a maximum of forty years.           Id. § 841(b)(1)(B).          He pled\n\nguilty and the district court accepted the plea.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -2-\n\f            Torres's   PSR    calculated      his   base    offense    level    as\n\ntwenty-six because he possessed 10.1 grams of crack.             See U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 2D1.1(c)(7) (2006).1       It subtracted from this number three levels\n\nfor acceptance of responsibility, see id. § 3E1.1, for a total\n\noffense level of twenty-three.          The PSR determined, however, that\n\nTorres qualified as a career offender under the Guidelines because\n\nhe fulfilled the three criteria in U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1:                  (1) he was\n\nover age eighteen when he committed the crime of conviction;\n\n(2) the crime of conviction was a controlled-substance offense; and\n\n(3) he had at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime\n\nof violence or a controlled-substance offense, or one of each. See\n\nid.   §   4B1.1(a).    Two    prior     convictions   are    relevant    to    the\n\ndiscussion    below.     First,    in    January    1996,   Torres     possessed\n\nmarijuana and crack cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school; a New\n\nJersey court convicted and sentenced him for possession with intent\n\nto distribute in October 1998 (\"New Jersey drug conviction\").\n\nSecond, in February 1996, Torres illegally possessed what the PSR\n\ndescribed as a \"fully-loaded M-11 machine gun\"; a New Jersey court\n\nconvicted him of possession of an assault firearm in October 1998,\n\nand set his sentence to run concurrently with that for the drug\n\n\n\n\n1\n   Torres was sentenced under the 2006 Guidelines.     Under the\namended 2007 Guidelines, this base offense level would have been\ntwenty-four. See U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(8) (2007).\n\n                                        -3-\n\foffense.2    At the time he committed both offenses, Torres was\n\nseventeen years old; at the time he was sentenced for both, he was\n\ntwenty.\n\n            Because    Torres   qualified   as   a    career   offender,   and\n\nbecause his offense of conviction has a statutory maximum of forty\n\nyears' imprisonment, the PSR calculated his base offense level as\n\nthirty-four.     See id. § 4B1.1(b)(B); 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B).\n\nThis base offense level superseded Torres's non-career-offender\n\nbase offense level of twenty-six by operation of the relevant\n\nprovision   in   the   career-offender      section    of   the    Guidelines.\n\nSee id. § 4B1.1(b) (\"[I]f the offense level for a career offender\n\nfrom the table in this subsection is greater than the offense level\n\notherwise applicable, the offense level from the table in this\n\nsubsection shall apply.\").       Under the terms of the same provision,\n\nthe PSR set Torres's Criminal History Category (\"CHC\") at VI.\n\nSee id. (\"A career offender's criminal history category in every\n\ncase under this subsection shall be Category VI.\").               The PSR then\n\n\n2\n   The PSR also listed what the Probation Office considered to be\na third prior New Jersey conviction, for burgling a store, which\nTorres committed in June 1998 and for which he was convicted and\nsentenced in October 1998. Below, we hold that the district court\nproperly counted the New Jersey drug conviction and the New Jersey\ngun conviction as career-offender predicates, and two qualifying\nprior convictions are all that is required.           See U.S.S.G.\n§ 4B1.1(a). For this reason, we need not state a view on whether\nthe burglary conviction was properly counted, and we deny Torres's\nrequest, made in a Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j) letter\nfollowing oral argument, to delay a decision in this case until the\nen banc court issues an opinion in United States v. Giggey,\nNo. 07-2317.\n\n                                    -4-\n\fsubtracted three points to take account of Torres's acceptance of\n\nresponsibility,          leaving     him    with    a   total   offense      level   of\n\nthirty-one and a CHC of VI.                 This produced a GSR of 188 to 235\n\nmonths.    Id. § 5A.\n\n               At     sentencing,     the    district     court     found    that    the\n\nGovernment had proved the New Jersey drug conviction and the New\n\nJersey gun conviction, that New Jersey law considered them adult\n\nconvictions, and that they therefore could be counted to render\n\nTorres     a    career      offender.         The    court   accepted       the   PSR's\n\nrecommendation that Torres's career-offender offense level should\n\nbe thirty-one, his CHC VI, and his resulting GSR 188 to 235 months.\n\nCalling Torres a \"classic career offender [of the type] Congress\n\nhad in mind for these long prison sentences,\" the court rejected\n\nTorres's       plea    to   vary    the    sentence     downward,    considered      the\n\n18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, and sentenced him near the bottom of\n\nthe range to 195 months in prison.                 Torres lodged a timely appeal.\n\n                                    II.     Discussion\n\n               A.     Standard of Review\n\n               We review the \"procedural component of the sentence for\n\nabuse of discretion; procedural errors amounting to an abuse of\n\ndiscretion might include 'failing to calculate (or improperly\n\ncalculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as\n\nmandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors,\n\nselecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing\n\n\n                                             -5-\n\fto   adequately         explain    the     chosen     sentence     --   including     an\n\nexplanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.'\"                      United\n\nStates v. Innarelli, 524 F.3d 286, 292 (1st Cir. 2008) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Politano, 522 F.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir. 2008)).                        Thus,\n\nthe district court's legal interpretation of Guidelines provisions\n\nreceives plenary review.               See United States v. Vázquez-Botet, 532\n\nF.3d 37, 65 (1st Cir. 2008).\n\n             B.    Whether Torres's 1996 Convictions May Count Toward\n                   His Career-Offender Status\n\n             As they did before the district court, the parties argue\n\nat length about whether it was proper for the district court to\n\ncount the New Jersey drug and gun convictions to render Torres a\n\ncareer offender, as he was seventeen when he committed both but\n\ntwenty when he was convicted and sentenced.                    See U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2\n\ncmt. n.1 (\"A conviction for an offense committed at age eighteen or\n\nolder   is   an        adult   conviction.        A   conviction    for   an   offense\n\ncommitted prior to age eighteen is an adult conviction if it is\n\nclassified        as     an    adult    conviction     under     the    laws   of     the\n\njurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted . . . .\").\n\nTorres contends that under the relevant New Jersey law the age of\n\nadulthood is eighteen, so his convictions for offenses committed\n\nwhen he was seventeen cannot be counted in his score.                                The\n\nGovernment counters that, even though Torres was a minor when he\n\ncommitted the offenses, he was convicted and sentenced at age\n\n\n\n                                            -6-\n\ftwenty and treated by the New Jersey court as an adult, so the\n\noffenses can be counted.\n\n            Under the circumstances, we need not delve into New\n\nJersey   law    or    how    the   New   Jersey    court        classified    Torres\n\nthereunder, because another provision in the Guidelines forecloses\n\nTorres's challenge.          Application Note 3 to § 4B1.2 states that\n\n\"[t]he provisions of §4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for\n\nComputing Criminal History) are applicable to the counting of\n\nconvictions\" for determining whether a defendant is a career\n\noffender.      Id. cmt. n.3.       One of the provisions of § 4A1.2, in\n\nturn, is Application Note 7, which discusses how to count offenses\n\ncommitted   prior      to    the   age   of    eighteen    for     purposes    of   a\n\ndefendant's criminal-history score where the crime of conviction\n\nwas commenced within five years of release from confinement:\n\n            Section 4A1.2(d) covers offenses committed\n            prior to age eighteen. . . . [F]or offenses\n            committed prior to age eighteen, only those\n            that . . . resulted in imposition of an adult\n            or   juvenile   sentence   or   release   from\n            confinement on that sentence within five years\n            of the defendant's commencement of the instant\n            offense are counted.     To avoid disparities\n            from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in the age\n            at   which  a   defendant   is  considered   a\n            \"juvenile,\" this provision applies to all\n            offenses committed prior to age eighteen.\n\nId. § 4A1.2 cmt. n.7.\n\n            The parties do not dispute that Torres was convicted of\n\nand sentenced for the New Jersey drug and gun offenses in October\n\n1998,    served      his    respective    sentences       for    the   two    crimes\n\n                                         -7-\n\fconcurrently, and was ultimately released from the New Jersey\n\ncorrectional facility in January 2002 after having been paroled for\n\na time and then having had his parole revoked.                     They likewise do\n\nnot dispute that Torres committed the \"instant offense\" -- that is,\n\nselling 10.1 grams of crack cocaine to an undercover agent -- in\n\nMay and June 2004, less than five years after Torres's January 2002\n\nrelease from New Jersey custody.                  The condition in Application\n\nNote 7 of § 4A1.2 was therefore triggered, and Application Note 3\n\nof § 4B1.2 allows recourse to Application Note 7 in determining\n\nwhether a prior conviction may be counted.                     See United States v.\n\nBacon,    94    F.3d    158,   161    (4th    Cir.     1996)    (\"Whether    a   prior\n\nconviction must be counted [toward a defendant's career-offender\n\nstatus] under § 4B1.1 is determined by reference to § 4A1.2.\"); see\n\nalso Stinson v. United States, 508 U.S. 36, 38 (1993) (Guidelines\n\ncommentary authoritative if it does not violate Constitution or\n\nfederal      statute,    and   is     not    inconsistent       with   the   relevant\n\nguideline itself).\n\n               As a result, the district court committed no error in\n\ncounting both New Jersey convictions in determining that Torres was\n\na   career     offender.       This   reading     of    the    relevant   Guidelines\n\nprovisions and commentary comports with that of the Sixth Circuit\n\nin United States v. Hinds, 2 F. App'x 420 (6th Cir. 2001) (per\n\ncuriam), which held that the district court had properly counted\n\nthe defendant's prior conviction toward his career-offender status\n\n\n                                            -8-\n\fbecause his release from prison occurred less than five years\n\nbefore he committed the federal offense that was the subject of the\n\nappeal.   Id. at 424-25.   Given this fact, the Hinds court did not\n\nreach the disputed question of whether the prior conviction was an\n\nadult conviction or a juvenile conviction.    See id. at 425.   Our\n\nreading is also consistent with that of the Third and Fourth\n\nCircuits. See, e.g., United States v. Moorer, 383 F.3d 164, 167-68\n\n(3d Cir. 2004) (relying on another portion of U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2 cmt.\n\nn.7, incorporated by reference through U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2 cmt. n.3,\n\nto determine that one of the defendant's prior convictions could be\n\ncounted for career-offender purposes); United States v. Mason, 284\n\nF.3d 555, 559 (4th Cir. 2002) (suggesting that, had less than five\n\nyears transpired between defendant's release from prison and his\n\ncommission of the instant offense, the prior conviction could have\n\nbeen counted toward his career-offender status).\n\n           For these reasons, it is immaterial whether Torres was\n\nclassified as an adult under New Jersey law, or whether the\n\nrelevant time for him to be so classified was when he committed\n\nthese crimes or when he was convicted and sentenced for them.3\n\nTherefore, provided the district court was correct in finding the\n\nNew Jersey gun conviction to be a \"crime of violence\" for career-\n\n\n3\n   Because we find an alternative ground for affirmance, we need\nnot state a view on whether the district court was correct in\ncharacterizing these as adult convictions. See United States v.\nBrown, 510 F.3d 57, 74 (1st Cir. 2007) (affirmance permitted on any\nground supported by record).\n\n                                 -9-\n\foffender purposes -- a question we address immediately below -- the\n\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in counting both the New Jersey\n\ndrug offense and the New Jersey gun offense as contributing to\n\nTorres's status as a career offender.\n\n            C. Whether the New Jersey Gun Conviction Was for a Crime\n               of Violence\n\n            The Guidelines list two types of offenses for which a\n\nprior conviction may be counted to render a defendant a career\n\noffender:     \"crime[s]       of    violence\"      and   \"controlled   substance\n\noffense[s].\" U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(a). The parties do not dispute that\n\nthe New Jersey drug conviction was for a controlled-substance\n\noffense, and is thus countable.               Torres does, however, challenge\n\nthe district court's conclusion that the New Jersey gun conviction\n\nwas for a crime of violence.\n\n            Section 4B1.2 of the Guidelines defines a \"crime of\n\nviolence\" as an offense that \"has as an element the use, attempted\n\nuse, or threatened use of physical force against the person of\n\nanother.\"       Application Note 1 elaborates on this definition,\n\nexplaining      in   pertinent      part    that   \"[u]nlawfully    possessing   a\n\nfirearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) (e.g., a sawed-off shotgun\n\nor sawed-off rifle, silencer, bomb, or machine gun) is a 'crime of\n\nviolence.'\"      U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2 cmt. n.1 ¶ 5.             Section 5845(a), in\n\nturn,   lists    a   number    of    firearms,     including   \"a   machinegun.\"\n\n26 U.S.C. § 5845(a)(6).            \"Machinegun\" is defined as \"any weapon\n\nwhich shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to\n\n                                           -10-\n\fshoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading,\n\nby a single function of the trigger.\"                Id. § 5845(b).    Hence, a\n\nprior conviction for unlawful possession of a machinegun meeting\n\nthis definition qualifies as a crime of violence for career-\n\noffender purposes.\n\n            According to the PSR, the New Jersey court convicted\n\nTorres of \"[p]ossession of an [a]ssault [f]irearm\" after he was\n\narrested carrying \"a fully-loaded M-11 machine gun.\"                  Torres did\n\nnot object to this characterization of the crime.                While the PSR\n\nrecommended that the 1996 New Jersey gun conviction be counted as\n\na crime of violence qualifying Torres for career-offender status,\n\nit   did   not   set   forth    an   analysis   of    whether   the   particular\n\nmachinegun Torres was convicted of possessing met the definition of\n\n\"machinegun\" in § 5845(b), or qualified as another of the firearms\n\nlisted in § 5845(a).           Faced with no objection from Torres, the\n\ndistrict court likewise did not undertake such an analysis, but\n\ninstead found the facts as presented in the PSR and adopted the\n\nPSR's legal recommendations. The court thus implicitly counted the\n\n1996 New Jersey gun conviction as a crime of violence contributing\n\nto Torres's status as a career offender.\n\n            As noted above, Torres now claims this was reversible\n\nerror.     He concedes that the New Jersey court convicted him of\n\npossessing an assault firearm, but asserts that New Jersey's\n\ndefinition of \"assault firearm\" includes many guns not meeting the\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fdefinition of any of the firearms in § 5845(a), and that the\n\nGovernment failed to discharge its burden of proving at sentencing\n\nthat it was indeed one of these firearms.               Since Torres did not\n\nraise this argument below, we review for plain error.               See United\n\nStates v. Brandao, No. 07-1215, ___ F.3d ___, 2008 WL 3866512, at\n\n*12 (1st Cir.

See United\n\nStates v. Jiménez, 512 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2007); Brown, 510 F.3d\n\nat 74.   Although Torres is correct in pointing out that the record\n\nlacks a detailed description of his gun, the Government would\n\nprobably   have   proffered    such    evidence     had    Torres   lodged    an\n\nobjection to the PSR.

It    is   exceedingly    unlikely   that   the\n\nunauthorized possession of a weapon described in the PSR as an\n\n\"M-11 machine gun,\" and by the New Jersey court as an \"assault\n\nweapon,\" could fail to meet the straightforward definition in\n\n§ 5845(b).4        Cf.

The Presentence Investigation Report (\"PSR\") determined him to be a career offender under the Sentencing Guidelines, resulting in a Guidelines Sentencing Range (\"GSR\") of 188 to 235 months. Counted for career-offender purposes were two New Jersey convictions  one for drug distribution and one for possessing an assault weapon  that Torres committed at age seventeen, and for which he was convicted and sentenced at age twenty. On appeal, Torres challenges his qualification as a career offender by arguing that these convictions were not properly countable because he was a juvenile when he committed them, and that the gun-possession offense was not a \"crime of violence,\" as required under the applicable guideline. He also argues that he must be resentenced to take account of recent Guidelines amendments concerning crack cocaine. After careful review, we affirm Torres's sentence.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I. <i>Background</i>\n</h2>\n<p>Torres sold 10.1 grams of crack cocaine to an undercover agent. He was arrested and charged with distributing five or more grams of cocaine base in violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1), an offense carrying a statutory mandatory minimum sentence of five years and a maximum of forty years. <i>Id.</i> § 841(b)(1)(B). He pled guilty and the district court accepted the plea.</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*50</span> Torres's PSR calculated his base offense level as twenty-six because he possessed 10.1 grams of crack. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(7) (2006).<sup>[1]</sup> It subtracted from this number three levels for acceptance of responsibility, <i>see id.</i> § 3E1.1, for a total offense level of twenty-three. The PSR determined, however, that Torres qualified as a career offender under the Guidelines because he fulfilled the three criteria in U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1: (1) he was over age eighteen when he committed the crime of conviction; (2) the crime of conviction was a controlled-substance offense; and (3) he had at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled-substance offense, or one of each. <i>See id.</i> § 4B1.1(a). Two prior convictions are relevant to the discussion below. First, in January 1996, Torres possessed marijuana and crack cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school; a New Jersey court convicted and sentenced him for possession with intent to distribute in October 1998 (\"New Jersey drug conviction\"). Second, in February 1996, Torres illegally possessed what the PSR described as a \"fully-loaded M-11 machine gun\"; a New Jersey court convicted him of possession of an assault firearm in October 1998, and set his sentence to run concurrently with that for the drug offense.<sup>[2]</sup> At the time he committed both offenses, Torres was seventeen years old; at the time he was sentenced for both, he was twenty.</p>\n<p>Because Torres qualified as a career offender, and because his offense of conviction has a statutory maximum of forty years' imprisonment, the PSR calculated his base offense level as thirty-four. <i>See id.</i> § 4B1.1(b)(B); 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B). This base offense level superseded Torres's non-career-offender base offense level of twenty-six by operation of the relevant provision in the career-offender section of the Guidelines. <i>See id.</i> § 4B1.1(b) (\"[I]f the offense level for a career offender from the table in this subsection is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the table in this subsection shall apply.\"). Under the terms of the same provision, the PSR set Torres's Criminal History Category (\"CHC\") at VI. <i>See id.</i> (\"A career offender's criminal history category in every case under this subsection shall be Category VI.\"). The PSR then subtracted three points to take account of Torres's acceptance of responsibility, leaving him with a total offense level of thirty-one and a CHC of VI. This produced a GSR of 188 to 235 months. <i>Id.</i> § 5A.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, the district court found that the Government had proved the New Jersey drug conviction and the New Jersey gun conviction, that New Jersey law considered them adult convictions, and that they therefore could be counted to render Torres a career offender. The court accepted the PSR's recommendation that Torres's career-offender offense level <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> should be thirty-one, his CHC VI, and his resulting GSR 188 to 235 months. Calling Torres a \"classic career offender [of the type] Congress had in mind for these long prison sentences,\" the court rejected Torres's plea to vary the sentence downward, considered the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, and sentenced him near the bottom of the range to 195 months in prison. Torres lodged a timely appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review the \"procedural component of the sentence for abuse of discretion; procedural errors amounting to an abuse of discretion might include `failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence  including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.'\" <i>United States v. Innarelli,</i> 524 F.3d 286, 292 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>United States v. Politano,</i> 522 F.3d 69, 72 (1st Cir.2008)). Thus, the district court's legal interpretation of Guidelines provisions receives plenary review. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Vázquez-Botet,</i> 532 F.3d 37, 65 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Whether Torres's 1996 Convictions May Count Toward His Career-Offender Status</h2>\n<p>As they did before the district court, the parties argue at length about whether it was proper for the district court to count the New Jersey drug and gun convictions to render Torres a career offender, as he was seventeen when he committed both but twenty when he was convicted and sentenced. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2 cmt. n. 1 (\"A conviction for an offense committed at age eighteen or older is an adult conviction. A conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen is an adult conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted....\"). Torres contends that under the relevant New Jersey law the age of adulthood is eighteen, so his convictions for offenses committed when he was seventeen cannot be counted in his score. The Government counters that, even though Torres was a minor when he <i>committed</i> the offenses, he was convicted and sentenced at age twenty and treated by the New Jersey court as an adult, so the offenses can be counted.</p>\n<p>Under the circumstances, we need not delve into New Jersey law or how the New Jersey court classified Torres thereunder, because another provision in the Guidelines forecloses Torres's challenge. Application Note 3 to § 4B1.2 states that \"[t]he provisions of § 4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History) are applicable to the counting of convictions\" for determining whether a defendant is a career offender. <i>Id.</i> cmt. n. 3. One of the provisions of § 4A1.2, in turn, is Application Note 7, which discusses how to count offenses committed prior to the age of eighteen for purposes of a defendant's criminal-history score where the crime of conviction was commenced within five years of release from confinement:</p>\n<blockquote>Section 4A1.2(d) covers offenses committed prior to age eighteen.... [F]or offenses committed prior to age eighteen, only those that ... resulted in imposition of an adult or juvenile sentence or release from confinement on that sentence within five years of the defendant's commencement of the instant offense are counted. To avoid disparities from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> age at which a defendant is considered a \"juvenile,\" this provision applies to all offenses committed prior to age eighteen.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 4A1.2 cmt. n. 7.</p>\n<p>The parties do not dispute that Torres was convicted of and sentenced for the New Jersey drug and gun offenses in October 1998, served his respective sentences for the two crimes concurrently, and was ultimately released from the New Jersey correctional facility in January 2002 after having been paroled for a time and then having had his parole revoked. They likewise do not dispute that Torres committed the \"instant offense\"  that is, selling 10.1 grams of crack cocaine to an undercover agent  in May and June 2004, less than five years after Torres's January 2002 release from New Jersey custody. The condition in Application Note 7 of § 4A1.2 was therefore triggered, and Application Note 3 of § 4B1.2 allows recourse to Application Note 7 in determining whether a prior conviction may be counted. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bacon,</i> 94 F.3d 158, 161 (4th Cir.1996) (\"Whether a prior conviction must be counted [toward a defendant's career-offender status] under § 4B1.1 is determined by reference to § 4A1.2.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Stinson v. United States,</i> 508 U.S. 36, 38, 113 S.Ct. 1913, 123 L.Ed.2d 598 (1993) (Guidelines commentary authoritative if it does not violate Constitution or federal statute, and is not inconsistent with the relevant guideline itself).</p>\n<p>As a result, the district court committed no error in counting both New Jersey convictions in determining that Torres was a career offender. This reading of the relevant Guidelines provisions and commentary comports with that of the Sixth Circuit in <i>United States v. Hinds,</i> 2 Fed. Appx. 420 (6th Cir.2001) (per curiam), which held that the district court had properly counted the defendant's prior conviction toward his career-offender status because his release from prison occurred less than five years before he committed the federal offense that was the subject of the appeal. <i>Id.</i> at 424-25. Given this fact, the <i>Hinds</i> court did not reach the disputed question of whether the prior conviction was an adult conviction or a juvenile conviction. <i>See id.</i> at 425. Our reading is also consistent with that of the Third and Fourth Circuits. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Moorer,</i> 383 F.3d 164, 167-68 (3d Cir.2004) (relying on another portion of U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2 cmt. n. 7, incorporated by reference through U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2 cmt. n. 3, to determine that one of the defendant's prior convictions could be counted for career-offender purposes); <i>United States v. Mason,</i> 284 F.3d 555, 559 (4th Cir.2002) (suggesting that, had less than five years transpired between defendant's release from prison and his commission of the instant offense, the prior conviction could have been counted toward his career-offender status).</p>\n<p>For these reasons, it is immaterial whether Torres was classified as an adult under New Jersey law, or whether the relevant time for him to be so classified was when he committed these crimes or when he was convicted and sentenced for them.<sup>[3]</sup> Therefore, provided the district court was correct in finding the New Jersey gun conviction to be a \"crime of violence\" for career-offender purposes  a question we address immediately below  the court did not abuse its discretion in counting both the New Jersey drug offense <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> and the New Jersey gun offense as contributing to Torres's status as a career offender.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Whether the New Jersey Gun Conviction Was for a Crime of Violence</h2>\n<p>The Guidelines list two types of offenses for which a prior conviction may be counted to render a defendant a career offender: \"crime[s] of violence\" and \"controlled substance offense[s].\" U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(a). The parties do not dispute that the New Jersey drug conviction was for a controlled-substance offense, and is thus countable. Torres does, however, challenge the district court's conclusion that the New Jersey gun conviction was for a crime of violence.</p>\n<p>Section 4B1.2 of the Guidelines defines a \"crime of violence\" as an offense that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" Application Note 1 elaborates on this definition, explaining in pertinent part that \"[u]nlawfully possessing a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) (<i>e.g.,</i> a sawed-off shotgun or sawed-off rifle, silencer, bomb, or machine gun) is a `crime of violence.'\" U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2 cmt. n. 1 ¶ 5. Section 5845(a), in turn, lists a number of firearms, including \"a machinegun.\" 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a)(6). \"Machinegun\" is defined as \"any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\" <i>Id.</i> § 5845(b). Hence, a prior conviction for unlawful possession of a machinegun meeting this definition qualifies as a crime of violence for career-offender purposes.</p>\n<p>According to the PSR, the New Jersey court convicted Torres of \"[p]ossession of an [a]ssault [f]irearm\" after he was arrested carrying \"a fully-loaded M-11 machine gun.\" Torres did not object to this characterization of the crime. While the PSR recommended that the 1996 New Jersey gun conviction be counted as a crime of violence qualifying Torres for career-offender status, it did not set forth an analysis of whether the particular machinegun Torres was convicted of possessing met the definition of \"machinegun\" in § 5845(b), or qualified as another of the firearms listed in § 5845(a). Faced with no objection from Torres, the district court likewise did not undertake such an analysis, but instead found the facts as presented in the PSR and adopted the PSR's legal recommendations. The court thus implicitly counted the 1996 New Jersey gun conviction as a crime of violence contributing to Torres's status as a career offender.</p>\n<p>As noted above, Torres now claims this was reversible error. He concedes that the New Jersey court convicted him of possessing an assault firearm, but asserts that New Jersey's definition of \"assault firearm\" includes many guns not meeting the definition of any of the firearms in § 5845(a), and that the Government failed to discharge its burden of proving at sentencing that it was indeed one of these firearms. Since Torres did not raise this argument below, we review for plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brandao,</i> 539 F.3d 44, 57 (1st Cir.2008) (plain-error standard asks (1) whether the district court erred; (2) whether the error was \"plain\"  that is, clear or obvious; and (3) whether this error affected the defendant's substantial rights and (4) whether the error \"`seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993))); <i>United States v. Colón-Díaz,</i> 521 F.3d 29, 33 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Brown,</i> 510 F.3d 57, 72 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Torres's argument is unavailing. Where, as here, the defendant does not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> object to a predicate conviction laid out in the PSR, the relevant paragraph in the PSR can be used to satisfy the Government's modest burden of proving the conviction. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jiménez,</i> 512 F.3d 1, 7 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Brown,</i> 510 F.3d at 74. Although Torres is correct in pointing out that the record lacks a detailed description of his gun, the Government would probably have proffered such evidence had Torres lodged an objection to the PSR. This, in turn, would have allowed the district court to perform a fully informed § 5845 inquiry, and us on appeal to review the court's inquiry. It is precisely because of this sort of scenario that the forfeiture rule exists.</p>\n<p>Under the circumstances of this case, we need not remand for resentencing so that the district court, with the benefit of additional evidence describing the gun, can perform the § 5845 inquiry. Defendant has not met his burden of showing error or that any error was plain. It is exceedingly unlikely that the unauthorized possession of a weapon described in the PSR as an \"M-11 machine gun,\" and by the New Jersey court as an \"assault weapon,\" could fail to meet the straightforward definition in § 5845(b).<sup>[4]</sup><i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Golding,</i> 332 F.3d 838, 840-43 (5th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (holding that unlawful machinegun possession is a crime of violence). We accordingly decline Torres's invitation to overturn the court's decision to count the New Jersey gun conviction as a career-offender predicate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Effect of <i>Kimbrough</i> and Amendments to Crack-Cocaine Guidelines</h2>\n<p>In his last sentencing challenge, Torres argues that this case must be remanded for resentencing to take account of the U.S. Sentencing Commission's recent amendment to the Guidelines lowering the offense levels for certain crack-cocaine offenses,<sup>[5]</sup> as well as the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, 128 S.Ct. 558, 169 L.Ed.2d 481 (2007), which postdated his sentencing. Yet as the Government argues and Torres concedes, what determined Torres's base offense level of thirty-four was the unamended statutory maximum for his crime  forty years  combined with the fact that he had sufficient predicate convictions to qualify him as a career offender. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B); U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(b)(B) (career-offender status combined with statutory maximum of twenty-five years or more yields base offense level of thirty-four). Thus, it would serve no purpose to remand for resentencing because, notwithstanding any salutary effect the Guideline amendment or <i>Kimbrough</i> may have had on Torres were he not a career offender, in this case the district court would still be compelled to assign him, as a career offender, a base offense level of thirty-four. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(b)(B); <i>see also </i><i>Jiménez,</i> 512 F.3d at 8-9. We accordingly reject this ground of appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, we affirm Torres's sentence.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Torres was sentenced under the 2006 Guidelines. Under the amended 2007 Guidelines, this base offense level would have been twenty-four. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(8) (2007).</p>\n<p>[2]  The PSR also listed what the Probation Office considered to be a third prior New Jersey conviction, for burgling a store, which Torres committed in June 1998 and for which he was convicted and sentenced in October 1998. Below, we hold that the district court properly counted the New Jersey drug conviction and the New Jersey gun conviction as career-offender predicates, and two qualifying prior convictions are all that is required. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(a). For this reason, we need not state a view on whether the burglary conviction was properly counted, and we deny Torres's request, made in a Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j) letter following oral argument, to delay a decision in this case until the en banc court issues an opinion in <i>United States v. Giggey,</i> No. 07-2317.</p>\n<p>[3]  Because we find an alternative ground for affirmance, we need not state a view on whether the district court was correct in characterizing these as adult convictions. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> 510 F.3d 57, 74 (1st Cir.2007) (affirmance permitted on any ground supported by record).</p>\n<p>[4]  We need not (and do not) decide today whether the possession of <i>any</i> assault weapon is per se a crime of violence for career-offender purposes, but merely that the district court's counting of the gun-possession conviction in this case was not plain error.</p>\n<p>[5]  <i>See supra</i> note 1.</p>\n\n</div>",

The PSR determined, however, that Torres qualified as a career offender under the Guidelines because he fulfilled the three criteria in U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1: (1) he was over age eighteen when he committed the crime of conviction; (2) the crime of conviction was a controlled-substance offense; and (3) he had at least two prior felony convictions of either a crime of violence or a controlled-substance offense, or one of each. <i>See id.</i> § 4B1.1(a). Two prior convictions are relevant to the discussion below. First, in January 1996, Torres possessed marijuana and crack cocaine within 1,000 feet of a school; a New Jersey court convicted and sentenced him for possession with intent to distribute in October 1998 (\"New Jersey drug conviction\"). Second, in February 1996, Torres illegally possessed what the PSR described as a \"fully-loaded M-11 machine gun\"; a New Jersey court convicted him of possession of an assault firearm in October 1998, and set his sentence to run concurrently with that for the drug offense.<sup>[2]</sup> At the time he committed both offenses, Torres was seventeen years old; at the time he was sentenced for both, he was twenty.</p>\n<p>Because Torres qualified as a career offender, and because his offense of conviction has a statutory maximum of forty years' imprisonment, the PSR calculated his base offense level as thirty-four. <i>See id.</i> § 4B1.1(b)(B); 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B). This base offense level superseded Torres's non-career-offender base offense level of twenty-six by operation of the relevant provision in the career-offender section of the Guidelines. <i>See id.</i> § 4B1.1(b) (\"[I]f the offense level for a career offender from the table in this subsection is greater than the offense level otherwise applicable, the offense level from the table in this subsection shall apply.\"). Under the terms of the same provision, the PSR set Torres's Criminal History Category (\"CHC\") at VI. <i>See id.</i> (\"A career offender's criminal history category in every case under this subsection shall be Category VI.\"). The PSR then subtracted three points to take account of Torres's acceptance of responsibility, leaving him with a total offense level of thirty-one and a CHC of VI. This produced a GSR of 188 to 235 months. <i>Id.</i> § 5A.</p>\n<p>At sentencing, the district court found that the Government had proved the New Jersey drug conviction and the New Jersey gun conviction, that New Jersey law considered them adult convictions, and that they therefore could be counted to render Torres a career offender. The court accepted the PSR's recommendation that Torres's career-offender offense level <span class=\"star-pagination\">*51</span> should be thirty-one, his CHC VI, and his resulting GSR 188 to 235 months. Calling Torres a \"classic career offender [of the type] Congress had in mind for these long prison sentences,\" the court rejected Torres's plea to vary the sentence downward, considered the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, and sentenced him near the bottom of the range to 195 months in prison. Torres lodged a timely appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II. <i>Discussion</i>\n</h2>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Standard of Review</h2>\n<p>We review the \"procedural component of the sentence for abuse of discretion; procedural errors amounting to an abuse of discretion might include `failing to calculate (or improperly calculating) the Guidelines range, treating the Guidelines as mandatory, failing to consider the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, selecting a sentence based on clearly erroneous facts, or failing to adequately explain the chosen sentence  including an explanation for any deviation from the Guidelines range.'\" <i>United States v. Innarelli,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203270\"><a href=\"/opinion/203270/united-states-v-innarelli/\"><span class=\"volume\">524</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">286</span></a></span>, 292 (1st Cir.2008) (quoting <i>United States v. Politano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203223\"><a href=\"/opinion/203223/united-states-v-politano/\"><span class=\"volume\">522</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">69</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.2008)). Thus, the district court's legal interpretation of Guidelines provisions receives plenary review. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Vázquez-Botet,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1425795\"><a href=\"/opinion/1425795/united-states-v-vazquez-botet/\"><span class=\"volume\">532</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">37</span></a></span>, 65 (1st Cir. 2008).</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. Whether Torres's 1996 Convictions May Count Toward His Career-Offender Status</h2>\n<p>As they did before the district court, the parties argue at length about whether it was proper for the district court to count the New Jersey drug and gun convictions to render Torres a career offender, as he was seventeen when he committed both but twenty when he was convicted and sentenced. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2 cmt. n. 1 (\"A conviction for an offense committed at age eighteen or older is an adult conviction. A conviction for an offense committed prior to age eighteen is an adult conviction if it is classified as an adult conviction under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the defendant was convicted....\"). Torres contends that under the relevant New Jersey law the age of adulthood is eighteen, so his convictions for offenses committed when he was seventeen cannot be counted in his score. The Government counters that, even though Torres was a minor when he <i>committed</i> the offenses, he was convicted and sentenced at age twenty and treated by the New Jersey court as an adult, so the offenses can be counted.</p>\n<p>Under the circumstances, we need not delve into New Jersey law or how the New Jersey court classified Torres thereunder, because another provision in the Guidelines forecloses Torres's challenge. Application Note 3 to § 4B1.2 states that \"[t]he provisions of § 4A1.2 (Definitions and Instructions for Computing Criminal History) are applicable to the counting of convictions\" for determining whether a defendant is a career offender. <i>Id.</i> cmt. n. 3. One of the provisions of § 4A1.2, in turn, is Application Note 7, which discusses how to count offenses committed prior to the age of eighteen for purposes of a defendant's criminal-history score where the crime of conviction was commenced within five years of release from confinement:</p>\n<blockquote>Section 4A1.2(d) covers offenses committed prior to age eighteen.... [F]or offenses committed prior to age eighteen, only those that ... resulted in imposition of an adult or juvenile sentence or release from confinement on that sentence within five years of the defendant's commencement of the instant offense are counted. To avoid disparities from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*52</span> age at which a defendant is considered a \"juvenile,\" this provision applies to all offenses committed prior to age eighteen.</blockquote>\n<p><i>Id.</i> § 4A1.2 cmt. n. 7.</p>\n<p>The parties do not dispute that Torres was convicted of and sentenced for the New Jersey drug and gun offenses in October 1998, served his respective sentences for the two crimes concurrently, and was ultimately released from the New Jersey correctional facility in January 2002 after having been paroled for a time and then having had his parole revoked. They likewise do not dispute that Torres committed the \"instant offense\"  that is, selling 10.1 grams of crack cocaine to an undercover agent  in May and June 2004, less than five years after Torres's January 2002 release from New Jersey custody. The condition in Application Note 7 of § 4A1.2 was therefore triggered, and Application Note 3 of § 4B1.2 allows recourse to Application Note 7 in determining whether a prior conviction may be counted. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Bacon,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"725066\"><a href=\"/opinion/725066/united-states-v-brian-bacon-aka-brian-hillard/\"><span class=\"volume\">94</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">158</span></a></span>, 161 (4th Cir.1996) (\"Whether a prior conviction must be counted [toward a defendant's career-offender status] under § 4B1.1 is determined by reference to § 4A1.2.\"); <i>see also </i><i>Stinson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112854\"><a href=\"/opinion/112854/stinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">508</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">36</span></a></span>, 38, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112854\"><a href=\"/opinion/112854/stinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1913</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112854\"><a href=\"/opinion/112854/stinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">123</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">598</span></a></span> (1993) (Guidelines commentary authoritative if it does not violate Constitution or federal statute, and is not inconsistent with the relevant guideline itself).</p>\n<p>As a result, the district court committed no error in counting both New Jersey convictions in determining that Torres was a career offender. This reading of the relevant Guidelines provisions and commentary comports with that of the Sixth Circuit in <i>United States v. Hinds,</i> 2 Fed. Appx. 420 (6th Cir.2001) (per curiam), which held that the district court had properly counted the defendant's prior conviction toward his career-offender status because his release from prison occurred less than five years before he committed the federal offense that was the subject of the appeal. <i>Id.</i> at 424-25. Given this fact, the <i>Hinds</i> court did not reach the disputed question of whether the prior conviction was an adult conviction or a juvenile conviction. <i>See id.</i> at 425. Our reading is also consistent with that of the Third and Fourth Circuits. <i>See, e.g., </i><i>United States v. Moorer,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"787691\"><a href=\"/opinion/787691/united-states-v-lavern-moorer/\"><span class=\"volume\">383</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">164</span></a></span>, 167-68 (3d Cir.2004) (relying on another portion of U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2 cmt. n. 7, incorporated by reference through U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2 cmt. n. 3, to determine that one of the defendant's prior convictions could be counted for career-offender purposes); <i>United States v. Mason,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776999\"><a href=\"/opinion/776999/united-states-v-james-anthony-mason/\"><span class=\"volume\">284</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">555</span></a></span>, 559 (4th Cir.2002) (suggesting that, had less than five years transpired between defendant's release from prison and his commission of the instant offense, the prior conviction could have been counted toward his career-offender status).</p>\n<p>For these reasons, it is immaterial whether Torres was classified as an adult under New Jersey law, or whether the relevant time for him to be so classified was when he committed these crimes or when he was convicted and sentenced for them.<sup>[3]</sup> Therefore, provided the district court was correct in finding the New Jersey gun conviction to be a \"crime of violence\" for career-offender purposes  a question we address immediately below  the court did not abuse its discretion in counting both the New Jersey drug offense <span class=\"star-pagination\">*53</span> and the New Jersey gun offense as contributing to Torres's status as a career offender.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>C. Whether the New Jersey Gun Conviction Was for a Crime of Violence</h2>\n<p>The Guidelines list two types of offenses for which a prior conviction may be counted to render a defendant a career offender: \"crime[s] of violence\" and \"controlled substance offense[s].\" U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(a). The parties do not dispute that the New Jersey drug conviction was for a controlled-substance offense, and is thus countable. Torres does, however, challenge the district court's conclusion that the New Jersey gun conviction was for a crime of violence.</p>\n<p>Section 4B1.2 of the Guidelines defines a \"crime of violence\" as an offense that \"has as an element the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against the person of another.\" Application Note 1 elaborates on this definition, explaining in pertinent part that \"[u]nlawfully possessing a firearm described in 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a) (<i>e.g.,</i> a sawed-off shotgun or sawed-off rifle, silencer, bomb, or machine gun) is a `crime of violence.'\" U.S.S.G. § 4B1.2 cmt. n. 1 ¶ 5. Section 5845(a), in turn, lists a number of firearms, including \"a machinegun.\" 26 U.S.C. § 5845(a)(6). \"Machinegun\" is defined as \"any weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be readily restored to shoot, automatically more than one shot, without manual reloading, by a single function of the trigger.\" <i>Id.</i> § 5845(b). Hence, a prior conviction for unlawful possession of a machinegun meeting this definition qualifies as a crime of violence for career-offender purposes.</p>\n<p>According to the PSR, the New Jersey court convicted Torres of \"[p]ossession of an [a]ssault [f]irearm\" after he was arrested carrying \"a fully-loaded M-11 machine gun.\" Torres did not object to this characterization of the crime. While the PSR recommended that the 1996 New Jersey gun conviction be counted as a crime of violence qualifying Torres for career-offender status, it did not set forth an analysis of whether the particular machinegun Torres was convicted of possessing met the definition of \"machinegun\" in § 5845(b), or qualified as another of the firearms listed in § 5845(a). Faced with no objection from Torres, the district court likewise did not undertake such an analysis, but instead found the facts as presented in the PSR and adopted the PSR's legal recommendations. The court thus implicitly counted the 1996 New Jersey gun conviction as a crime of violence contributing to Torres's status as a career offender.</p>\n<p>As noted above, Torres now claims this was reversible error. He concedes that the New Jersey court convicted him of possessing an assault firearm, but asserts that New Jersey's definition of \"assault firearm\" includes many guns not meeting the definition of any of the firearms in § 5845(a), and that the Government failed to discharge its burden of proving at sentencing that it was indeed one of these firearms. Since Torres did not raise this argument below, we review for plain error. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brandao,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1427539\"><a href=\"/opinion/1427539/united-states-v-brandao/\"><span class=\"volume\">539</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">44</span></a></span>, 57 (1st Cir.2008) (plain-error standard asks (1) whether the district court erred; (2) whether the error was \"plain\"  that is, clear or obvious; and (3) whether this error affected the defendant's substantial rights and (4) whether the error \"`seriously affect[ed] the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings'\" (quoting <i>United States v. Olano,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">507</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">725</span></a></span>, 732, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112848\"><a href=\"/opinion/112848/united-states-v-olano/\"><span class=\"volume\">113</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">508</span></a></span> (1993))); <i>United States v. Colón-Díaz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203204\"><a href=\"/opinion/203204/united-states-v-colon-diaz/\"><span class=\"volume\">521</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 33 (1st Cir.2008); <i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203058\"><a href=\"/opinion/203058/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 72 (1st Cir.2007).</p>\n<p>Torres's argument is unavailing. Where, as here, the defendant does not <span class=\"star-pagination\">*54</span> object to a predicate conviction laid out in the PSR, the relevant paragraph in the PSR can be used to satisfy the Government's modest burden of proving the conviction. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Jiménez,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203091\"><a href=\"/opinion/203091/united-states-v-jimenez/\"><span class=\"volume\">512</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 7 (1st Cir.2007); <i>Brown,</i> 510 F.3d at 74. Although Torres is correct in pointing out that the record lacks a detailed description of his gun, the Government would probably have proffered such evidence had Torres lodged an objection to the PSR. This, in turn, would have allowed the district court to perform a fully informed § 5845 inquiry, and us on appeal to review the court's inquiry. It is precisely because of this sort of scenario that the forfeiture rule exists.</p>\n<p>Under the circumstances of this case, we need not remand for resentencing so that the district court, with the benefit of additional evidence describing the gun, can perform the § 5845 inquiry. Defendant has not met his burden of showing error or that any error was plain. It is exceedingly unlikely that the unauthorized possession of a weapon described in the PSR as an \"M-11 machine gun,\" and by the New Jersey court as an \"assault weapon,\" could fail to meet the straightforward definition in § 5845(b).<sup>[4]</sup><i>Cf. </i><i>United States v. Golding,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"31295\"><a href=\"/opinion/31295/united-states-v-golding/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">838</span></a></span>, 840-43 (5th Cir.2003) (per curiam) (holding that unlawful machinegun possession is a crime of violence). We accordingly decline Torres's invitation to overturn the court's decision to count the New Jersey gun conviction as a career-offender predicate.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>D. Effect of <i>Kimbrough</i> and Amendments to Crack-Cocaine Guidelines</h2>\n<p>In his last sentencing challenge, Torres argues that this case must be remanded for resentencing to take account of the U.S. Sentencing Commission's recent amendment to the Guidelines lowering the offense levels for certain crack-cocaine offenses,<sup>[5]</sup> as well as the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Kimbrough v. United States,</i> ___ U.S. ___, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145841\"><a href=\"/opinion/145841/kimbrough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">128</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">558</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"145841\"><a href=\"/opinion/145841/kimbrough-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">169</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">481</span></a></span> (2007), which postdated his sentencing. Yet as the Government argues and Torres concedes, what determined Torres's base offense level of thirty-four was the unamended statutory maximum for his crime  forty years  combined with the fact that he had sufficient predicate convictions to qualify him as a career offender. <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. § 841(b)(1)(B); U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(b)(B) (career-offender status combined with statutory maximum of twenty-five years or more yields base offense level of thirty-four). Thus, it would serve no purpose to remand for resentencing because, notwithstanding any salutary effect the Guideline amendment or <i>Kimbrough</i> may have had on Torres were he not a career offender, in this case the district court would still be compelled to assign him, as a career offender, a base offense level of thirty-four. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(b)(B); <i>see also </i><i>Jiménez,</i> 512 F.3d at 8-9. We accordingly reject this ground of appeal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>III. <i>Conclusion</i>\n</h2>\n<p>For these reasons, we affirm Torres's sentence.</p>\n<p><i>Affirmed.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Northern District of Florida, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Torres was sentenced under the 2006 Guidelines. Under the amended 2007 Guidelines, this base offense level would have been twenty-four. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(8) (2007).</p>\n<p>[2]  The PSR also listed what the Probation Office considered to be a third prior New Jersey conviction, for burgling a store, which Torres committed in June 1998 and for which he was convicted and sentenced in October 1998. Below, we hold that the district court properly counted the New Jersey drug conviction and the New Jersey gun conviction as career-offender predicates, and two qualifying prior convictions are all that is required. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(a). For this reason, we need not state a view on whether the burglary conviction was properly counted, and we deny Torres's request, made in a Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 28(j) letter following oral argument, to delay a decision in this case until the en banc court issues an opinion in <i>United States v. Giggey,</i> No. 07-2317.</p>\n<p>[3]  Because we find an alternative ground for affirmance, we need not state a view on whether the district court was correct in characterizing these as adult convictions. <i>See </i><i>United States v. Brown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203058\"><a href=\"/opinion/203058/united-states-v-brown/\"><span class=\"volume\">510</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 74 (1st Cir.2007) (affirmance permitted on any ground supported by record).</p>\n<p>[4]  We need not (and do not) decide today whether the possession of <i>any</i> assault weapon is per se a crime of violence for career-offender purposes, but merely that the district court's counting of the gun-possession conviction in this case was not plain error.</p>\n<p>[5]  <i>See supra</i> note 1.</p>\n\n</div>",
