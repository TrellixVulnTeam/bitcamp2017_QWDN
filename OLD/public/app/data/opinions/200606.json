Salvador E. Casellas, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                     Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                  Coffin, Senior Circuit Judge,\n                    and Lipez, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Ignacio Fernández de Lahongrais for appellant Andrés García-\nTorres.\n     Ramón García García for appellant Walter Batíz-Rivera.\n     Enrique Vélez Rodríguez for appellant Angel Manuel García-\nTorres.\n     Sonia I. Torres Pabón, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom H.S. García, United States Attorney and Nelson Pérez-Sosa,\nAssistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for appellee.\n\n\n\n                         August 22, 2003\n\f          LIPEZ, Circuit Judge.    These consolidated appeals arise\n\nfrom an indictment alleging that the appellants, along with over\n\nseventy other co-defendants, participated in an extensive drug\n\nsmuggling and distribution network in southwest Puerto Rico from\n\n1994 to 1997.    The appellants were all convicted at trial and\n\nsentenced to lengthy prison terms.     They make various assignments\n\nof error with regard to the jury charge, a post-trial denial of a\n\nmotion for a new trial on Brady grounds, and sentencing.       With\n\nrespect to the latter, we must decide whether the grouping of\n\noffenses pursuant to § 3D1.2 of the United States Sentencing\n\nGuidelines    (\"Guidelines\")   precludes    consecutive   sentences.\n\nConcluding that it does not, we affirm all of the convictions and\n\nsentences.1\n\n                                  I.\n\n          We begin with a brief precis of the facts giving rise to\n\nthese appeals. We provide further factual development as necessary\n\nin the sections addressing the appellants' various claims.       For\n\nmore extensive background information, we refer the reader to the\n\nprior appeals of other co-defendants — United States v. García-\n\n\n\n\n     1\n        Three of the appellants (Andrés García-Torres, Manuel\nGarcía-Torres, and Walter Batíz-Rivera) have, through counsel,\nfiled a consolidated brief. Appellant Deri Ventura-García, through\ncounsel, has filed his own brief in which he only challenges the\ndistrict court's denial of his motion for a new trial. See infra\nPart III.\n\n                                -2-\n\fTorres, 280 F.3d 1 (1st Cir. 2002); and United States v. Martínez-\n\nMedina, 279 F.3d 105 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n               All of the appellants in this case allegedly participated\n\nin an extensive drug importation and distribution ring headed by\n\nAngela Ayala-Martínez (\"Ayala\").              Through contacts in Colombia,\n\nAyala would arrange for large quantities of drugs to be air-dropped\n\ninto the ocean off the coast of Puerto Rico.                She would then send\n\nseveral of her associates — including Manuel Pérez-Colón (\"Pérez-\n\nColón\") and appellants Andrés García-Torres (\"Andrés\") and Deri\n\nVentura-García (\"Ventura\") — to recover the drugs from the ocean.\n\nThe drugs would then be stored by members of Ayala's organization\n\nand    \"decked\"       (i.e.,   prepared      for   distribution)     by    Ayala's\n\nconfederates — including appellants Walter Batíz-Rivera (\"Batíz\"),\n\nVentura, Andrés, and Andrés's brother, appellant Angel Manuel\n\nGarcía-Torres (\"Manuel\"). The drugs were then distributed by these\n\npersons and others to places in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the\n\nUnited States.\n\n               Locally, Ayala supplied and controlled distribution sites\n\n(called \"points\") which were \"owned\" (i.e., run) by individual\n\ndealers.        Several   of   these   points      were   located   near   housing\n\nprojects in and around the city of Ponce.                 For example, the point\n\nat    Atocha    was   owned    by   Edward    Meléndez-Negrón,      a.k.a.   Danny\n\nGongolon (\"Gongolon\").          The point at Los Lirios del Sur housing\n\nproject was owned by Pérez-Colón, and the point at Tibes belonged\n\n\n                                        -3-\n\fto Ayala herself. Of particular significance to these appeals, the\n\nLa Cantera drug point belonged to Tommy García-Torres (\"Tommy\"),\n\nthe brother of Andrés and Manuel, until August 1995 when he was\n\nmurdered. The La Cantera drug point was then \"inherited\" by Manuel\n\nand Ventura.\n\n          Ayala's drug distribution network and the various drug\n\npoints were maintained through violence or threatened violence, and\n\na number of killings took place over several years.        The network\n\nprocessed hundreds of kilos of cocaine and generated a sizeable\n\namount of cash receipts.      Ayala, along with her coconspirators,\n\nconcealed these sums of cash by money laundering them through the\n\npurchase of goods and services, in particular air conditioners and\n\nexpensive vehicles that were registered under different names.\n\n          In December 1997, a grand jury returned a superceding\n\nindictment alleging, inter alia, that from mid-1994 to mid-1997,\n\nseventy-six    individually   named    defendants   participated    in   a\n\nconspiracy to distribute illegal narcotics (Count I).              See 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846. The indictment also alleged that twenty-\n\nnine of these defendants conspired to launder money (Count II).\n\nSee 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a), (h).    The vast majority of the defendants\n\npleaded guilty and were sentenced to lengthy prison terms.            The\n\nfour appellants herein, together with Ayala, Pérez-Colón, and\n\nMarcos Martínez-Medina (\"Martínez\"), were convicted following a\n\njury trial that lasted over forty days.      The jury found appellants\n\n\n                                 -4-\n\fAndrés and Manuel guilty on Counts I and II (drug conspiracy and\n\nmoney laundering conspiracy), and appellants Ventura and Batíz on\n\nCount I (drug conspiracy) only.     Andrés and Manuel were sentenced\n\non each count to twenty years of imprisonment, the terms to be\n\nserved consecutively, for a total of forty years of imprisonment.\n\nVentura and Batíz were each sentenced to twenty years for their\n\nconvictions on Count I.\n\n                                  II.\n\n          Andrés and Manuel were convicted in Count II of violating\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1956, which provides in pertinent part:\n\n          (a)(1) Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a\n                 financial transaction represents the proceeds of\n                 some form of unlawful activity, conducts or\n                 attempts to conduct such a financial transaction\n                 which in fact involves the proceeds of specified\n                 unlawful activity —\n\n                 (A) (i) with the intent to promote the carrying\n                     on of specified unlawful activity; or\n\n                          * * *\n\n                 (B) knowing that the transaction is designed in\n                     whole or in part —\n                     (i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the\n                     location, the source, the ownership, or the\n                     control of the proceeds of specified unlawful\n                     activity . . . .\n\n          shall be sentenced to a fine . . . or imprisonment for\n          not more than twenty years, or both.\n\nId. (emphasis added).     Subsection (A)(i) can be described as the\n\n\"promotion\" element of the statute, and subsection (B)(i) can be\n\ndescribed as the \"concealment\" element of the statute.       As the\n\n\n                                  -5-\n\fstatute unambiguously indicates, a conviction may be predicated on\n\neither the promotion prong or the concealment prong.\n\n          The superceding indictment in this case alleged that\n\nAndrés and Manuel, in conjunction with others, conspired to violate\n\n§ 1956, with the language of the indictment closely tracking that\n\nof the statute with one exception.          The indictment alleged that\n\nAndrés and Manuel had conspired to conduct unlawful financial\n\ntransactions   \"with   the   intent   to   promote   the   carrying   on   of\n\nspecified unlawful activity and knowing that the transactions\n\n[were] designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the\n\nnature, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds\n\nof specified unlawful activity\" (emphasis added).          Thus, while the\n\nstatute puts the promotion and concealment elements of § 1956 in\n\nthe disjunctive, the indictment alleged them in the conjunctive.\n\n          The district court, for its part, properly instructed the\n\njury in the disjunctive:\n\n                 Section 1956(a)(1) of Title 18 of the\n          United States Code makes it a crime to,\n          knowing that the property involved in a\n          financial transaction represents the proceeds\n          of some form of unlawful activity, conduct or\n          attempt to conduct a financial transaction\n          which in fact involves the proceeds of\n          specified unlawful activity.\n\n                 One, with the intent to promote the\n          carrying on of a specified unlawful activity;\n          or\n\n                 Two, knowing that the transaction is\n          designed in whole or in part to conceal the\n          nature,   the  location,  the  source,  the\n\n                                  -6-\n\f            ownership, or control of the          proceeds     of\n            specified unlawful activity.\n\n(emphasis    added).     Andrés   and   Manuel   now   argue   that   it   was\n\nreversible error for the district court to instruct the jury in the\n\ndisjunctive while the indictment alleged the violation of § 1956 in\n\nthe conjunctive.       Moreover, the argument goes, if the district\n\ncourt had properly instructed the jury in the conjunctive, the\n\ngovernment would have had to prove both the concealment prong and\n\nthe promotion prong beyond a reasonable doubt.           Andrés and Manuel\n\nclaim that the government did not adduce any evidence on the\n\nconcealment prong, and, therefore, they are entitled to have their\n\nconviction reversed on the money laundering count.\n\n            In evaluating this claim, we first note that Andrés and\n\nManuel failed to object to the jury instruction they now say was\n\nerroneous.     Hence their argument about the jury instruction has\n\nbeen forfeited. See United States v. Paniagua-Ramos, 251 F.3d 242,\n\n246 (1st Cir. 2001) (\"[I]t is settled beyond peradventure that a\n\nparty's failure to object to the charge in strict conformity with\n\nthe prerequisites of Rule 30 forfeits most instructional errors.\").\n\nAlthough the appellants can still invoke plain error review, this\n\nstandard is notoriously difficult to meet.\n\n             To vault this hurdle, a defendant must make\n             four showings. First, he must show that an\n             error occurred. Second, he must show that the\n             error was clear or obvious. Third, he must\n             show that the error affected his substantial\n             rights. Fourth, he must show that the error so\n             seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or\n\n                                    -7-\n\f            public reputation of the proceedings as to\n            threaten a miscarriage of justice.\n\nId.; see Johnson v. United States, 520 U.S. 461, 466–67 (1997);\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 732 (1993).\n\n             While we have not previously had occasion to consider the\n\nargument presented by Andrés and Manuel, the Ninth Circuit has. In\n\nUnited States v. Booth, 309 F.3d 566 (9th Cir. 2002), the defendant\n\nwas convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)(1).                    The indictment\n\nhad \"alleged conjunctively that [the defendant] conducted the\n\nunlawful financial transactions 'with the intent to promote the\n\ncarrying on of the specified unlawful activity and knowing that the\n\ntransaction was designed . . . to conceal and disguise' the\n\nproceeds.\"    Booth, 309 F.3d at 571–72 (modifications in original).\n\nAt the close of the trial, however, the court instructed the jury\n\nin the disjunctive:       \"the jury was permitted to convict if it found\n\nthat   [the      defendant]    had       conducted        the    money    laundering\n\ntransactions     either    with    the     intent    to    promote     the   unlawful\n\nactivity    or   knowing    that     the    transactions        were     designed   to\n\nconceal.\"     Id. at 572.\n\n            As the Ninth Circuit succinctly put it, \"[t]here was no\n\nreversible error in this sequence of events.\"                   Id.   \"Quite simply,\n\nthe law is well established that where an indictment charges in the\n\nconjunctive several means of violating a statute, a conviction may\n\nbe obtained on proof of only one of the means, and accordingly the\n\njury instruction may properly be framed in the disjunctive.\"\n\n                                         -8-\n\fUnited States v. Simpson, 228 F.3d 1294, 1300 (11th Cir. 2000).   As\n\nwe indicated over thirty years ago in United States v. Barbato, 471\n\nF.2d 918 (1st Cir. 1973), a prosecution for fraud under 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1010:\n\n          Where a statute . . . sets forth several\n          different means by which an offense may be\n          committed, it is permissible for a count in an\n          indictment to allege all or several of these\n          means in the conjunctive.     A conviction on\n          such a count will stand if the evidence\n          establishing one or more of the means of\n          commission alleged is sufficient to support a\n          jury verdict.\n\nUnited States v. Barbato, 471 F.2d 918, 922 n.3 (1st Cir. 1973);\n\nsee also United States v. Miller, 471 U.S. 130, 134–38 (1985)\n\n(indicating that, if indictment gave clear notice of charges, there\n\nis no reversible error when jury convicts on proof of only one of\n\nseveral means of committing crime alleged in the indictment).     As\n\na result, \"proof of any one of those acts conjunctively charged may\n\nsupport a conviction.\"    United States v. LeDonne, 21 F.3d 1418,\n\n1427 (7th Cir. 1994); United States v. Fontana, 948 F.2d 796, 802\n\n(1st Cir. 1991).   There was no error in the jury instruction on the\n\ncrime of money laundering.     Andrés and Manuel concede that the\n\ngovernment presented sufficient evidence to satisfy the promotion\n\nprong of § 1956.   We therefore affirm the convictions of Andrés and\n\nManuel on Count II.\n\n\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\f                                III.\n\n          Following their convictions but prior to sentencing, all\n\nfour appellants, together with Martínez, moved for a new trial\n\nunder Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), claiming that the\n\ngovernment had improperly withheld a sworn statement containing\n\nexculpatory and impeachment evidence.    In July 1999 the district\n\ncourt conducted a two-day evidentiary hearing on the motion.   In a\n\nthorough opinion and order dated May 18, 2000, the district court\n\ndenied the request for a new trial.      The appellants now assign\n\nerror to this ruling.    Before addressing the appellants' claim of\n\nerror, however, we must first describe in some depth the evidence\n\npresented at trial concerning the murders of Michael and Eddie\n\nVázquez, an event that is central to the new trial motion.   Many of\n\nthe facts described below have already been recounted in Martínez-\n\nMedina, 279 F.3d at 112-13.\n\n                        A. Factual Background\n\n          At the La Cantera drug point, a dispute arose in 1994\n\nwhen Tommy (the brother of Andrés and Manuel) fired \"Gerardito,\"\n\nhis brother-in-law and a drug runner, for having allegedly stolen\n\nover $35,000 in drug proceeds. Following his ouster, Gerardito and\n\nhis brother \"Nelsito\" began to associate with Michael Vázquez\n\n(\"Michael\") and his father Eddie Vázquez (\"Eddie\").      While the\n\nVázquezes had no demonstrated connection with the drug trade, they\n\ndid have a sizable cache of weapons and were willing to help\n\n\n                                -10-\n\fGerardito seek revenge against the García brothers. A violent feud\n\nsoon   developed     with    the    Garcías   and   their    allies     (including\n\nVentura, Ayala, Martínez, Batíz, and Gongolon) on one side, and\n\nGerardito and his faction (including Nelsito, the Vázquezes, and\n\nthe Vázquezes' employee, José Negrón-Santiago, a.k.a. \"Bejumen\") on\n\nthe other.\n\n               Over the next few years, this rivalry turned deadly.              In\n\n1995 Tommy and a confrere were murdered in separate incidents.\n\nThat same year, a friend of Gerardito, \"Gordo,\" was also murdered.\n\nEach side blamed the other.            The following year, Eddie shot and\n\nwounded Gongolon. The ongoing violence targeted the drug points of\n\nthe García       faction    and    caused   the   García    brothers    and    their\n\ncolleagues to fear that Gerardito's clan was bent on revenge and\n\nthe takeover of their business.               Moreover, the violence at the\n\npoints had attracted the attention of the local police, causing\n\nsales figures to drop.        So, from 1995 to 1997, the García brothers\n\nand    their    colleagues    repeatedly      attempted     to   find    and    kill\n\nGerardito, Nelsito, the Vázquezes, and Bejumen to put an end to it\n\nall.\n\n               They eventually succeeded. On February 14, 1997, Bejumen\n\nand his wife were shot and killed in their automobile.                   Gamaliel\n\nGoglas-Valentin (\"Goglas\"), an auto shop employee who also stored\n\ndrugs and guns for the Garcías, testified at trial that Andrés,\n\nManuel, and Martínez drove into his shop and celebrated openly that\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fthey had \"finally got the bastard,\" Bejumen.      He also testified\n\nthat Andrés reported that the three of them had ambushed Bejumen's\n\ncar, and that Martínez and Andrés then opened the car door and shot\n\nBejumen and his wife repeatedly at close range.\n\n           Danny Gongolon testified at trial that a few days after\n\nBejumen's murder, Ventura approached Gongolon and told him that\n\nManuel knew some kidnappers who knew where the Vázquezes lived.\n\nFor a $20,000 fee, these kidnappers were willing to pose as police\n\nofficers and \"arrest\" Michael and turn him over to the García\n\nfaction.   The $20,000 price tag was to be split among Manuel,\n\nGongolon, Ventura, and Ayala.      At a meeting later that day,\n\nGongolon, Andrés, Manuel, Ventura, and Batíz made plans to carry\n\nout the abduction and murder.\n\n           As we indicated in Martínez-Medina, what happened next is\n\nnot altogether clear.\n\n           Although the testimony of various witnesses is\n           somewhat unclear as to the precise chain of\n           events, it appears that the kidnappers handed\n           Michael Vázquez over to associates of the\n           García group — including Manuel and Andrés\n           García, Gongolon, Ventura, and Batíz — who\n           drove away with him and killed him. They also\n           found and shot Eddie Vázquez.\n\n279 F.3d at 112.     Goglas testified that the morning after the\n\nVázquez murders, Manuel and Ventura came to his shop to have him\n\nrepair bullet damage to their vehicle.    At that time, Manuel and\n\nVentura recounted the Vázquez murders to him.     A couple of weeks\n\nafterwards, he ran into Andrés who also spoke of his role in the\n\n                                -12-\n\fabduction and murders.          Gongolon testified that immediately after\n\nthe Vázquez killings, he called Ayala to announce that he had some\n\ngood news; he also told her to prepare breakfast and that he would\n\nbe right over.       He then drove to Ayala's house and immediately told\n\nher of the Vázquezes' deaths. Ayala expressed elation at the news,\n\nand after breakfast she drove to the scene of the murders to see\n\nfor herself.\n\n                      B.    The Purported Brady Material\n\n               The motion for a new trial is based on a sworn statement\n\nby Jaime Morales-Rivera (\"Morales\") that was given to the Puerto\n\nRico       state   prosecutor   in   May    1998   during   the   course   of   an\n\ninvestigation into the Vázquez murders.                 The appellants first\n\nlearned of the existence of Morales's statement at a preliminary\n\nhearing in the state prosecution of Manuel and Ventura for the\n\nVázquez murders, four months after the verdict had been entered\n\nagainst them in the federal case.2\n\n               In the statement, Morales declared that he joined the\n\nPuerto Rico police in 1992.          While an officer, he participated in\n\nvarious       criminal     activities,     including   burglary,    kidnapping,\n\nmurder, and planting of evidence.               For example, Morales assisted\n\nJosé Galiany-Cruz (\"Galiany\") in an attempt to kidnap someone on\n\n\n\n\n       2\n       Manuel, Andrés, and Ventura eventually pleaded guilty in\nstate court to the murder of Michael Vázquez.\n\n                                         -13-\n\fbehalf of Galiany's employer, Santos Martínez (\"Santos\"), a drug\n\ndealer apparently unconnected to Ayala and the Garcías.\n\n            In his statement, Morales goes on to say that Galiany\n\napproached him about another job for Santos in February 1997\n\ninvolving the kidnapping of someone whose father, according to\n\nGaliany, owed Santos four million dollars.                     That \"someone\" turned\n\nout to be Michael Vázquez, whose father was Eddie Vázquez.                               The\n\nstatement    then    provides      details       of    Morales's         involvement     in\n\nMichael's abduction and murder.                While Morales's account of what\n\nhappened the night of the Vázquez murders varied in some minor ways\n\nfrom the     testimony      presented      at    trial,       the    substance      of   his\n\ntestimony did not vary significantly from the testimony of Goglas\n\nand Gongolon.\n\n                      C.    The Motion for a New Trial\n\n            Upon     learning      of    the    existence           of   the    statement,\n\nappellants       Andrés,    Manuel,      Ventura,       Batíz,       and    co-defendant\n\nMartínez all moved for a new trial.                          They claimed that the\n\ngovernment had intentionally withheld the statement and that it\n\ncontained exculpatory and impeachment evidence of such probative\n\nvalue that it undermined confidence in the verdict.                            According to\n\nthe   defendants,        the     statement       was     exculpatory           because    it\n\ndemonstrated      that     the   Vázquez       murders       were    not    part    of   the\n\nconspiracy charged in this case, and because it could be used to\n\nimpeach    the    testimony      of     Gongolon       and    Goglas       regarding     the\n\n\n                                         -14-\n\fdefendants' involvement in the Bejumen and Vázquez murders.                   In\n\nresponse, the government conceded that it was in possession of the\n\nsworn statement well before the start of trial and that it should\n\nhave been divulged to the defendants.            The government maintained,\n\nhowever, that the withholding of the evidence was unintentional and\n\nnot in bad faith.        Moreover, according to the government, the\n\nstatement     would     have    been    ultimately       inadmissible     and/or\n\nimmaterial,    and,     therefore,     its    absence     did   not     undermine\n\nconfidence in the verdict.\n\n            The district court conducted a two-day hearing which\n\nincluded    testimony    from   Morales,      Galiany,    the   local    district\n\nattorney, and an FBI agent assigned to the case. Galiany testified\n\nthat he had been approached by Manuel who told him that he was\n\nhaving problems with Michael and Eddie Vázquez, and that Manuel\n\nsuggested a plan in which Galiany would kidnap them and turn them\n\nover to Manuel so that he could kill them.           Galiany then contacted\n\nMorales and relayed to him the plan which they eventually executed.\n\n            At the hearing, Galiany admitted to having told Morales\n\nthat he had been contracted by Santos.          Galiany went on to testify,\n\nhowever, that he had told Morales this lie in order to protect the\n\nidentity of the person who had actually hired him — Manuel.                   The\n\nsubstance of Morales's testimony at the hearing was the same as\n\ncontained in his prior sworn statement, with a few additional\n\ndetails concerning the abduction of Michael Vázquez.\n\n\n                                       -15-\n\f           The    district   court,     after   asking    for   post-hearing\n\nbriefing, denied the motion for a new trial in an exhaustive\n\nopinion and order that dismissed the impeachment and exculpatory\n\nvalue of Morales's statement, determined that the government had\n\nnot   withheld    the   evidence   in   bad   faith,   and   raised   serious\n\nquestions about the evidence's admissibility.            For purposes of its\n\nanalysis, however, the court assumed that the evidence would be\n\nadmissible.      The court then concluded that the probative value of\n\nthe evidence did not merit a new trial:\n\n           After reviewing the rest of the evidence about\n           defendants'   involvement    in    the  charged\n           conspiracy, the Court finds that even in the\n           absence of the Morales [] statement[,]\n           defendants received a fair trial which\n           resulted in a confidence-worthy verdict.\n           Contrary to their contention, the Vázquezes\n           murders was not the only evidence the\n           government had to link defendants to the\n           charged conspiracy. At trial, the government\n           presented the testimony, among others, of\n           unindicted    coconspirator     [Goglas],   who\n           testified   about    the    participation    of\n           [Martínez], Manuel and [Andrés] in the murders\n           of rival gang member Bejumen and his wife.\n           Evidence was also presented of Manuel,\n           [Andrés] and [Ventura's] drug dealings with\n           Angela Ayala-Martínez.      The evidence also\n           established that [Batíz] used to work for\n           [Ventura] and Manuel decking drugs at La\n           Cantera drug point.       All this evidence\n           sufficiently established that defendants were\n           part of the charged, and not a separate and\n           distinct, conspiracy.\n\nIn a previous appeal, we upheld the denial of the motion for a new\n\ntrial with respect to defendant Martínez, stating that Morales's\n\nstatement did not directly undermine Goglas's testimony concerning\n\n                                    -16-\n\fMartínez's involvement in Bejumen's murder — the murder that\n\n\"provided the main link between Martínez and the drug conspiracy.\"\n\nMartínez-Medina, 279 F.3d at 126. Rather, Morales's statement went\n\nonly to the Vázquez murders.        \"Such weak impeachment evidence,\" we\n\nindicated,    \"on   an   issue    tangential       to   the   conviction   is   not\n\nsufficient to warrant the drastic remedy of a new trial.\"                   Id. at\n\n127.\n\n                          D.     The Legal Standard\n\n            When a Brady claim is raised in a motion for a new trial,\n\nwe review the denial of that motion for abuse of discretion.\n\nUnited States v. Gil, 297 F.3d 93, 101 (2d Cir. 2002); United\n\nStates v. Josleyn, 206 F.3d 144, 151 (1st Cir. 2000).3               Under Brady\n\nand its progeny, a new trial is warranted on a Brady claim only if\n\nthe withheld evidence is \"material.\"           See id. at 151–52.          That is\n\nto say, a new trial is warranted only if there is a \"reasonable\n\nprobability\" that the evidence would have changed the ultimate\n\noutcome.     United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. 667, 682 (1985).                 The\n\nSupreme    Court    further    clarified     the    \"reasonable     probability\"\n\nconcept when it stated: \"The question is not whether the defendant\n\nwould more likely than not have received a different verdict with\n\nthe evidence, but whether in its absence he received a fair trial,\n\nunderstood as a trial resulting in a verdict worthy of confidence.\"\n\n\n       3\n       However, \"[w]here it is contended that the district court\napplied an incorrect legal standard, that contention is reviewed de\nnovo.\" Josleyn, 206 F.3d at 151. There is no such claim here.\n\n                                      -17-\n\fStrickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 289–90 (1999) (quoting Kyles v.\n\nWhitley, 514 U.S. 419, 434 (1995)).\n\n           Both impeachment evidence and exculpatory evidence can\n\nprovide grounds for a new trial.          Wrongly withheld impeachment\n\nevidence can merit a new trial when \"the evidence is highly\n\nimpeaching or when the witness' testimony is uncorroborated and\n\nessential to the conviction.\"       Martínez-Medina, 279 F.3d at 126.\n\nHowever,   \"impeachment   evidence    that    is     merely   cumulative   or\n\ncollateral is insufficient to establish prejudice under Brady.\"\n\nConley v. United States, 323 F.3d 7, 30 (1st Cir. 2003).              As for\n\nexculpatory evidence, such evidence must still be material, and\n\n\"[t]he materiality standard is not met by 'the mere possibility\n\nthat an item of undisclosed information might have helped the\n\ndefense, or might have affected the outcome of the trial.'\" United\n\nStates v. Hamilton, 107 F.3d 499, 509 (7th Cir. 1997) (quoting\n\nUnited States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. 97, 109-10 (1976)). Instead, once\n\nagain, the exculpatory material must be of such probative value\n\nthat there is a \"'reasonable probability' that the evidence would\n\nhave changed the result.\"      United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d\n\n1216, 1220 (1st Cir. 1993).\n\n                              E.   Analysis\n\n           The appellants claim that, notwithstanding our earlier\n\nrejection of Martínez's Brady claim, they are entitled to a new\n\ntrial   because   Morales's   statement      would    have    had   different\n\n\n                                   -18-\n\fconsequences for them than for Martínez.                 They assert that the\n\nprincipal prosecution witness against them was Goglas, and that his\n\ntestimony concerning their involvement in the Bejumen and Vázquez\n\nmurders provided \"the main link between appellants and the Angela\n\nAyala      conspiracy.\"         They    claim   that     Morales's    statement\n\nsufficiently undermines Goglas's testimony regarding both sets of\n\nmurders as to make all of his testimony unreliable.                  As for the\n\nVázquez murders, they insist that Morales's statement would have\n\ndemonstrated that their involvement in them was only the result of\n\na grudge and not the Ayala conspiracy.           Therefore, they claim, the\n\nwithheld evidence sufficiently undermines confidence in the verdict\n\nto warrant a new trial.         We disagree.\n\n             As we noted in Martínez's case, the exculpatory and/or\n\nimpeachment value (if any) of Morales's statement only directly\n\npertains to the Vázquez murders.           As the district court noted, if\n\nthe appellants had managed to get the Morales statement admitted\n\ninto evidence (a questionable proposition), the government would\n\nhave then been entitled to call Galiany as a witness, and Galiany\n\nwould have likely testified (as he did at the Brady hearing) that\n\nhe   had   fabricated     the   story   about   Santos    having   ordered   the\n\nkidnapping in order to keep Morales from learning that the García\n\ngroup was behind the plan.         Moreover, any impeachment value of the\n\nstatement, as the district court noted, would have been minimal\n\nsince the deviations in substance concerning the mechanics of the\n\nVázquez murders were negligible.\n\n                                        -19-\n\f              Additionally,   as   the    district    court   noted   in   its\n\nopinion, the Vázquez and Bejumen murders were hardly the only\n\nevidence linking Andrés, Manuel, and Ventura with the Ayala drug\n\ndistribution network.     There was testimony from other witnesses\n\nthat cash and drugs repeatedly exchanged hands among these three\n\nappellants and Ayala, and that Andrés and Ventura helped Ayala\n\nretrieve airdropped drugs from the sea.         Witnesses also testified\n\nabout the control Ventura and Manuel exercised over the La Cantera\n\ndrug point, as well as the intimate role that Batíz played in La\n\nCantera's administration.\n\n            Finally, the appellants exploited other opportunities to\n\nattack   Goglas's   credibility,   such    as   his   inconsistencies      and\n\nomissions between his trial and grand jury testimony.            Therefore,\n\nin light of the weak evidentiary value of Morales's statement, and\n\nthe substantial other evidence of the appellants' involvement in\n\nthe conspiracy, we cannot say that the government's failure to\n\nproduce the Morales statement \"undermine[s] [our] confidence in the\n\nverdict.\"     Martínez-Medina, 279 F.3d at 126 (quoting Kyles, 514\n\nU.S. at 435).    The district court properly denied the appellants'\n\nmotions for a new trial.\n\n                                   IV.\n\n            The appellants make three arguments related to their\n\nsentencing.     Manuel and Andrés claim that the sentencing court\n\nerred in failing to group the drug conspiracy and the money\n\n\n                                   -20-\n\flaundering convictions under section 3D1.2 of the Guidelines. They\n\nalso claim that the court erred in sentencing them to the statutory\n\nmaximum on the money laundering count.       Finally, Manuel and Batíz\n\nclaim that the court erred when it sentenced them without the\n\nbenefit of an updated Pre-Sentence Report.\n\n                             A.   Grouping\n\n          Section 3D1.2 of the Guidelines provides that closely\n\nrelated counts should be \"grouped\" for purposes of sentencing.\n\nManuel   and   Andrés's   respective     Pre-Sentence   Reports   (\"PSR\")\n\ncontained identical paragraphs regarding the grouping of their\n\nconvictions on Count I (drug conspiracy) and Count II (money\n\nlaundering conspiracy):\n\n           Offense conduct comprising drug trafficking\n           and money laundering are normally grouped\n           together into a combined group as the offense\n           conduct involves substantially the same harm\n           within the meaning of Guideline § 3D1.2(b); to\n           wit: the counts involve the same victim\n           (society) and two or more acts or transactions\n           connected by a common criminal objective or\n           constituting part of a common scheme or plan.\n           However, the offense conduct comprising count\n           one not only involved generalized drug\n           trafficking activities, but also involved\n           murder.   As such, the two counts are not\n           groupable under the provisions of Guideline\n           § 3D1.2 and are treated as to [sic] distinct\n           counts to be grouped under the provisions of\n           Guideline § 3D1.4, Determining the Combined\n           Offense Level.\n\nThe defendants objected to this reasoning, arguing that Counts I\n\nand II should have been grouped according to the plain language of\n\n\n\n                                  -21-\n\fU.S.S.G. § 3D1.2(c) and (d),4 and they renew this argument on\n\nappeal.     The government, citing no authority, responds by simply\n\nstating that since the drug conspiracy involved murder, Count I was\n\nsomehow    \"exempt\"     from   grouping        under   any   provision   of   the\n\nGuidelines.\n\n            These arguments reflect a shared failure by appellants\n\nand the government to understand that the district court did, in\n\nfact,     group   the   two    counts    for     sentencing    purposes.      The\n\nmisunderstanding        apparently      arises     because    of   the     court's\n\nimposition of consecutive sentences, which the appellants and the\n\n\n     4\n         Section 3D1.2 of the Guidelines provides, in pertinent part:\n\n            All counts involving substantially the same\n            harm shall be grouped together into a single\n            Group. Counts involve substantially the same\n            harm within the meaning of this rule:\n            * * *\n            (c) When one of the counts embodies conduct\n                that is treated as a specific offense\n                characteristic in, or other adjustment to,\n                the guideline applicable to another of the\n                counts.\n            (d) When the offense level is determined\n                largely on the basis of the total amount\n                of harm or loss, the quantity of a\n                substance involved, or some other measure\n                of aggregate harm, or if the offense\n                behavior is ongoing or continuous in\n                nature and the offense guideline is\n                written to cover such behavior.\n\n                  [The following offenses] are to be\n                  grouped under this subsection:\n\nSubsection (d) then goes on to identify the offenses which it\ncovers. Drug conspiracy and money laundering are included in that\nlist.\n\n                                        -22-\n\fgovernment interpret as a rejection of \"grouping.\"                There was no\n\nsuch rejection by the district court.\n\n           Early in Manuel's sentencing hearing, the court indicated\n\nits inclination to adopt the factual findings of the PSR with\n\nrespect   to   Count   I.     Relying     on   the    guideline   for   a   drug\n\nconspiracy, U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(c)(3), the court calculated a base\n\noffense level of 38 since the offense of conviction involved more\n\nthan 150 kilograms of cocaine.           Then the court indicated that it\n\nwas inclined to add a four-level enhancement pursuant to § 3B1.1(a)\n\nbecause   of   Manuel's     leadership    role;   a   two-level    enhancement\n\npursuant to § 2D1.1(b)(1) because of his possession of dangerous\n\nweapons during the offense; and a two-level enhancement pursuant to\n\n§ 3C1.1 because of his attempts to obstruct justice in connection\n\nwith police investigations into the Bejumen and Vázquez murders,\n\nresulting in an adjusted offense level (\"AOL\") of 46.               Given that\n\nthe maximum possible offense level under the Guidelines is 43, the\n\ncourt stated that it was inclined to use that number.             According to\n\nthe Sentencing Table in Part 5 of the Guidelines, an AOL of 43\n\nresults in a guideline sentencing range (\"GSR\") of life in prison,\n\nirrespective of criminal history.5         The court said nothing about an\n\noffense level for Count II.       The court did state, however, that it\n\nwas inclined to exercise its \"discretion\" under § 5G1.2(d) and\n\n\n\n     5\n      The court did state that it was inclined to set the criminal\nhistory category of Manuel at III.\n\n                                    -23-\n\fimpose the statutory maximum sentence (20 years) on each count, the\n\nterms to run consecutively.6             The court then heard from counsel.\n\n                  Manuel raised many objections to the court's sentencing\n\nrationale, all of which were overruled.               In particular, he argued\n\n—   in       an   apparent   reference   to   the   imposition   of   consecutive\n\nsentences — that the court had to \"group\" the two counts for\n\nsentencing and hence could not impose consecutive sentences.                 The\n\nsentencing court responded with an explanation that reflected a\n\nclear understanding of the rules of grouping, as that term of art\n\nis used in § 3D1.2:\n\n                  Regarding    consecutive     sentences,    the\n                  guidelines provide and it is mandatory that we\n                  group counts 1 and 2 for sentencing purposes\n                  we have no discretion in that sense. We are\n                  mandated by the guidelines to group them\n                  together. To determine the maximum guideline\n                  range of the 2 counts and than [sic] apply\n                  that guideline range. In this case what the\n                  court proposes to do, and according to the\n                  findings that I just stated, we group counts 1\n                  and 2 as mandated by the guidelines.        We\n                  determine the guideline range for count one\n                  which gives a guideline range of life. That\n                  is the highest guideline range for both\n                  counts. Count one, the maximum statutory is\n                  20 years, . . . the court will not impose over\n                  20 years regarding count 1. Regarding count\n                  two, the guideline range is life imprisonment,\n                  it is the same guideline sentencing range.7\n\n\n         6\n       Section 5G1.2 of the Guidelines is captioned \"Sentencing on\nMultiple Counts of Conviction\" and is discussed in more detail,\ninfra.\n         7\n       The applicable guideline for the money laundering count\nprovides that the offense level for that count is \"[t]he offense\nlevel for the underlying offense from which the laundered funds\n\n                                         -24-\n\f          However the statutory maximum is 20 years. So\n          we will apply the statutory maximum. That is\n          how this court has arrived at those sentencing\n          maximums. Regarding the consecutive part, we\n          believe this court is authorized under section\n          5G1 of the guidelines to provide that these\n          sentences be consecutive in order to provide\n          that the total punishment of these guidelines\n          be complied as much as possible within the\n          statutory maximums.\n\n(emphasis added).   Under the relevant \"grouping\" section of the\n\nGuidelines, § 3D1.3(a), \"the offense level applicable to a Group is\n\nthe offense level . . . for the most serious of the counts\n\ncomprising the Group.\"   The district court's decision to focus on\n\nCount I, and only calculate an AOL and GSR for that count, is\n\ntherefore consistent with the rules regarding grouping.8    Hence,\n\ncontrary to Manuel's position on appeal, the district court did not\n\nfail to \"group\" Counts I and II for sentencing.9   As far as we can\n\n\nwere derived,\" U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(a)(1), that is to say, the same\noffense level as the drug conspiracy.\n     8\n       Even if the sentencing court had not grouped the two counts,\nthe combined offense level would have been the same as the offense\nlevel arrived at by the district court. The base offense level for\nmoney laundering is the same as that for the underlying criminal\nactivity. See U.S.S.G. § 2S1.1(a)(1). As a result, the combined\noffense level for the two ungrouped counts would have been the same\nas the offense level applicable to both crimes.            See id.\n§ 3D1.4(a). Thus, even a decision not to group would have had no\nnet effect.\n     9\n       We realize that at the end of the hearing, when the court\nwas orally imposing Manuel's sentence, the court appears to have\nread some of the text of the PSR when, according to the transcript,\nthe court stated:\n\n     Offense conduct comprising drug trafficking and money\n     laundering are normally grouped together into a combined\n\n                               -25-\n\ftell, Manuel's grievance is with the court's decision to impose\n\nconsecutive rather than concurrent sentences, apparently on the\n\ntheory that grouping precludes consecutive sentences.\n\n          Section 5G1.2(d) of the Guidelines provides that:\n\n          If the sentence imposed on the count carrying\n          the highest statutory maximum is less than the\n          total punishment, then the sentence imposed on\n          one or more of the other counts shall run\n          consecutively,   but   only  to   the   extent\n          necessary to produce a combined sentence equal\n          to the total punishment.        In all other\n          respects, sentences on all counts shall run\n          concurrently, except to the extent otherwise\n          required by law.\n\nThe \"total punishment,\" as described in this section, \"is the\n\nsentence arrived at for all counts through application of the\n\nGuidelines, including determination of the base offense levels,\n\napplication   of   grouping   provisions,   and   calculation   of   other\n\nadjustments.\"      United States v. Lott, 310 F.3d 1231, 1242 (10th\n\n\n     group as the offense conduct involves substantially the\n     same arm [sic] within the meaning of guideline section\n     3D1.2(b) to wit the counts involve the same victim,\n     society and 2 or more acts or transactions connected by\n     a common criminal objective or constituting part of a\n     common scheme or plan. However, as the offense conduct\n     comprising count 1 not only involved generalized drug\n     trafficking activities but also involved murder, the 2\n     counts of conviction are not groupable under the\n     provisions of section 3D1.2.\n\nImmediately after making these comments, however, the court\ncalculated Manuel's sentence by looking only to the most serious\noffense, i.e., Count I, a method of calculation appropriate only if\nthe court was, in fact, grouping the two counts. Compare U.S.S.G.\n§ 3D1.3 (explaining how to determine offense level for grouped\ncounts) with id. § 3D1.4 (explaining how to determine combined\noffense level for ungrouped counts).\n\n                                  -26-\n\fCir. 2002).     The sentencing court fixes this \"total punishment\"\n\nsomewhere    within     the    applicable       GSR.     See U.S.S.G.      §    5G1.2,\n\ncomment. (n.1) (\"The combined length of the sentences ('total\n\npunishment') is determined by the court after determining the\n\nadjusted     combined     offense        level    and     the   Criminal       History\n\nCategory.\").    Since Manuel's GSR was not truly a range, but rather\n\n\"life\" only, the sentencing court had no option but to fix Manuel's\n\n\"total punishment\" at life imprisonment.                 However, the two counts\n\non which Manuel's conviction rested each had a statutory maximum\n\nsentence of only twenty years. The sentencing court indicated that\n\nit   would   therefore        exercise    its    \"discretion\"     under     U.S.S.G.\n\n§ 5G1.2(d) and impose sentences on the two counts consecutively in\n\norder to get as close to a life term as possible.\n\n             Like every other circuit that has considered the issue,\n\nwe have previously stated that the language of § 5G1.2(d) —\n\nindicating    that    sentences     \"shall run          consecutively\"     (emphasis\n\nadded) — is mandatory in order to achieve, to the greatest extent\n\npossible, a combined sentence \"equal to the total punishment.\"\n\nUnited States v. Saccoccia, 58 F.3d 754, 787 (1st Cir. 1995); see\n\nUnited States v. Lafayette, No. 01-3067, 2003 WL 21766619, at *6\n\nn.12 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 1, 2003) (collecting cases).10 That is, if the\n\n\n      10\n       In Saccoccia, we explained the application of this mandatory\nrequirement in these terms:\n\n      When, as in this instance, the maximum sentence for each\n      offense of conviction is lower than the minimum\n\n                                         -27-\n\fcombined statutory maximum sentences on the counts of conviction\n\nare less than the \"total punishment\" set by the judge within the\n\nGSR, then the court must impose maximum consecutive sentences on\n\neach count in an attempt to get as close as possible to this \"total\n\npunishment.\"     See U.S.S.G. § 5G1.2(d).\n\n           The grouping of Manuel's two counts pursuant to § 3D1.2\n\ndoes not preclude the imposition of consecutive sentences on each\n\nof them.   See United States v. Chase, 296 F.3d 247, 251 (4th Cir.\n\n2002).   As explained persuasively in Chase, \"grouping and stacking\n\nare   separate   concepts   relevant    in   different   stages   of   the\n\nsentencing process.\"    Chase, 296 F.3d. at 251.     Grouping is one of\n\nthe first steps undertaken during the sentencing process, and is\n\ndone \"[i]n order to limit the significance of the formal charging\n\ndecision and to prevent multiple punishment for substantially\n\nidentical offense conduct,\" U.S.S.G. ch. 3, pt. D, intro. comment.\n\nIn fact, the grouping of counts will often result in an appreciably\n\nlower offense level and correspondingly lower GSR than if the\n\n\n      punishment mandated by the applicable GSR, the guidelines\n      require imposition of consecutive sentences \"to the\n      extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to\n      the total punishment.\"\n\nSaccoccia, 58 F.3d at 786 (quoting U.S.S.G. § 5G1.2(d)); see also\nid. at 787 (\"[T]he court below possessed the power — indeed, the\nresponsibility — to impose a series of consecutive sentences\neffectuating the clearly expressed command of U.S.S.G. § 5G1.2.\").\nIn United States v. Quinones, 26 F.3d 213 (1st Cir. 1994), we\nindicated that a sentencing court may disregard the mandate of\n§ 5G1.2 only \"if, and to the extent that, circumstances exist that\nwarrant a departure.\" Id. at 216.\n\n                                 -28-\n\fcounts had not been grouped.     See, e.g., United States v. Sedoma,\n\n332 F.3d 20, 23–24 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n          After the sentencing court has determined the offense\n\nlevel (including all upward and downward adjustments) — whether for\n\na group of counts, a combination of individual counts, or multiple\n\ngroups — then, as explained above, the court fixes the \"total\n\npunishment\" within the applicable GSR.         While grouping plays a\n\ncritical role in these early stages of the sentencing calculus,\n\nonce the court has fixed the \"total punishment\" somewhere within\n\nthe GSR, the Guidelines provide no further role for grouping in the\n\nsentencing process.     If one of the underlying counts of conviction\n\nhas a statutory maximum sentence greater than or equal to the\n\n\"total   punishment,\"    the   court   will   then   impose   the   \"total\n\npunishment\" on that count, with sentences on any other counts\n\nrunning concurrently.     See U.S.S.G. § 5G1.2(d).     If, however, none\n\nof the underlying counts of conviction have a statutory maximum\n\nsentence greater than or equal to the \"total punishment,\" the\n\nGuidelines mandate the imposition of consecutive sentences in order\n\nto achieve (as close as possible) the \"total punishment.\"           See id.\n\nHence, \"as a purely logical matter, there is no obstacle to\n\nstacking a defendant's sentences for grouped offenses.\" Chase, 296\n\nF.3d at 251.\n\n          Other courts have repeatedly held that grouped counts may\n\nbe \"stacked\" at sentencing.      See id.; see also Lott, 310 F.3d at\n\n\n                                  -29-\n\f1242 (indicating that sentencing court must apply § 5G1.2(d) on\n\ngrouped counts); United States v. Miller, 295 F.3d 824, 828 (8th\n\nCir. 2002) (affirming consecutive sentences on grouped counts);\n\nUnited    States     v.     Gordon,    291    F.3d    181,      195    (2d    Cir.   2002)\n\n(indicating that grouped counts may be stacked);                       United States v.\n\nMcWaine,    290      F.3d    269,     274    n.4    (5th   Cir.       2002)   (affirming\n\nconsecutive       sentences     on     grouped      counts);      United      States    v.\n\nBuckland, 289 F.3d 558, 572 (9th Cir. 2002) (en banc) (same);\n\nUnited States v. Griffith, 85 F.3d 284, 289 n.2 (7th Cir. 1996)\n\n(indicating same in dicta); United States v. Perez, 956 F.2d 1098,\n\n1102–03    (11th     Cir.    1992)     (affirming      consecutive        sentences    on\n\ngrouped counts).          Indeed, we have already indicated in dicta that\n\nthe   grouping       of   counts      poses    no    bar   to    the     imposition    of\n\nconsecutive sentences when necessary to achieve a combined sentence\n\nequivalent      to    the    total     punishment.         See    United      States    v.\n\nHernandez-Coplin, 24 F.3d 312, 320 n.9 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            Finally, we agree with the Chase court that the stacking\n\nof    grouped     offenses      furthers       the     policies         underlying     the\n\nGuidelines.       The Guidelines were intended, in part, to create \"a\n\nsystem that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal\n\nconduct    of   differing      severity.\"           U.S.S.G.      ch.    1,   pt.    A(3).\n\nHowever, \"[i]f stacking for grouped offenses were prohibited, then\n\ntwo defendants guilty of multiple crimes might receive roughly the\n\nsame sentence even though one was subject to a higher guideline\n\n\n                                            -30-\n\frange as a result of more harmful conduct or a more egregious\n\ncriminal history.\"        Chase, 296 F.3d at 253.\n\n           In sum, the plain language of the Guidelines contemplates\n\nthat consecutive sentences may be imposed on grouped counts; it has\n\nbeen the practice of other courts to do so; and such a practice\n\nfurthers the policies underlying the Guidelines.                      We therefore\n\nconclude that the grouping of Counts I and II did not preclude the\n\nimposition of consecutive sentences on the grouped offenses, and we\n\naffirm Manuel's sentence.\n\n           As     for   Andrés's   sentencing     hearing       (which    occurred\n\nimmediately after Manuel's), the court followed the same approach.\n\nIt alluded to the PSR's claim that the two counts should not be\n\ngrouped,   but,    ultimately,     the    court   did    group    them    when   it\n\ncalculated   the    GSR    by   looking   only    to    Count    I.      The   court\n\ndetermined that the base offense level for Count I, as in Manuel's\n\ncase, was 38.       The court then made a two-level adjustment for\n\nweapons possession, and arrived at an AOL of 40. Cross-referencing\n\nto a CHC of III, the court arrived at a GSR of 360 months to life.\n\nThe court determined that within that range, a total punishment of\n\nlife was appropriate \"due to all the facts of this case[,] the\n\ndefendant[']s participation, his disregard for life, for murders\n\nand all of the other incidents that this court saw throughout the\n\nthree months of trial.\"         Having thus fixed the total punishment at\n\nlife, the district court was obligated under § 5G1.2(d), as it was\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\fin Manuel's case, to impose a 20-year sentence (the statutory\n\nmaximum) on each count, the sentences to run consecutively.                       We\n\ndiscern no error in the sentencing of Andrés.\n\n                     B.    The Money Laundering Count\n\n            Manuel and Andrés argue that the sentencing court erred\n\nwhen it sentenced them to the maximum term on the money laundering\n\ncount   \"without     making       any   particularized        findings   of     fact\"\n\nregarding the value of the funds laundered.                   As explained in the\n\npreceding section, however, the district court made no findings\n\nwhatsoever on the money laundering count because the court grouped\n\nthe two     counts   and       calculated   Manuel     and    Andrés's   GSRs    only\n\naccording to its findings on the \"most serious\" count, i.e., the\n\ndrug count.     Once the court determined the total punishment for\n\nManuel and Andrés, it was then obligated to sentence them to the\n\nstatutory    maximum      on    each    count,   and   impose    those   sentences\n\nconsecutively, in order to achieve a final sentence that most\n\nclosely approximated that total punishment.                  Thus, if the district\n\ncourt had made particularized findings on the money laundering\n\ncount, they would have had no effect on the ultimate sentence\n\nimposed.    We therefore reject this assignment of error.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -32-\n\f                   C.   The \"Post-Sentence\" Report\n\n            Appellants Manuel11 and Batíz argue that the trial court\n\nerred when it sentenced them without the benefit of an updated PSR.\n\nInitial PSRs for Manuel and Batíz were prepared by the Probation\n\nOffice on April 20, 1999.    Because of various post-trial motions,\n\nincluding some based on Apprendi v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466\n\n(2000), their sentencing was postponed until December 2001. Manuel\n\nand Batíz also lodged several objections to the PSR's calculations.\n\nAt their sentencing, they objected to a murder cross-reference on\n\nCount I, and, in the case of Manuel, certain findings regarding\n\nCount II.    As indicated in Part IV.A, supra, however, the court\n\nultimately did not apply a murder cross-reference on Count I, and\n\nwith regard to Manuel's sentencing, the court made no findings on\n\nCount II since the court grouped that count with Count I.   A month\n\nafter the court had imposed its sentence, the probation office\n\nissued updated PSRs that no longer reflected the murder cross-\n\nreference.     Manuel and Batíz claim that, as a result of the\n\nissuance of this \"Post-Sentence Report\" (as they call it), they are\n\nentitled to be resentenced.\n\n\n\n\n     11\n       The consolidated brief indicates that this argument is being\nadvanced by Manuel and Batíz. The Supplemental Appendix, however,\nonly contains copies of revised PSRs for Andrés and Batíz.\nRegardless of who is actually pressing this claim, we find it to be\nmeritless.\n\n                                 -33-\n\f          The version of Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal\n\nProcedure in effect at the time of sentencing provided in pertinent\n\npart:\n\n          The probation officer must make a presentence\n          investigation and submit a report to the court\n          before the sentence is imposed, unless:\n\n             (A)     the court finds that the information\n                     in the record enables it to exercise\n                     its sentencing authority meaningfully\n                     under 18 U.S.C. § 3553; and\n             (B)     the court explains this finding on the\n                     record.\n\nFed. R. Crim. P. 32(b)(1) (2001).    Section 6A1.1 of the Guidelines\n\ncontains almost identical language.\n\n          Our examination of the sentencing transcript reveals that\n\nthe sentencing court complied with these requirements.        At the\n\nsentencing hearing the court indicated that it was setting the\n\noffense levels on Count I based on its recollections of the\n\nevidence presented at trial, and on the factual findings contained\n\nin the original PSRs.      The court was aware of the defendants'\n\nobjections to those factual findings, and the court overruled them.\n\nAs explained above, the court ignored the PSRs' cross-referencing\n\nof murder.    The fact that a subsequent PSR, completed post-\n\nsentencing, reflected the court's decision, is simply irrelevant.\n\nThe court had sufficient information before it \"to exercise its\n\nsentencing authority meaningfully,\" and we therefore affirm the\n\nsentences imposed.\n\n\n\n                                 -34-\n\f                               V.\n\n         For the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the convictions and\n\nsentences of all four appellants.\n\n\n\n          SO ORDERED.\n\n\n\n\n                              -35-\n\f",

Mart&#237;nez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d 105 (1st Cir.2002).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">All of the appellants in this case allegedly participated in an extensive drug importation and distribution ring headed by Angela Ayala-Mart&#237;nez (\"Ayala\"). Through contacts in Colombia, Ayala would arrange for large quantities of drugs to be air-dropped into the ocean off the coast of Puerto Rico. She would then send several of her associates &#8212; including Manuel P&#233;rez-Col&#243;n (\"P&#233;rez-Col&#243;n\") and appellants Andr&#233;s Garc&#237;a-Torres (\"Andr&#233;s\") and Deri Ventura-Garc&#237;a (\"Ventura\") &#8212; to recover the drugs from the ocean. The drugs would then be stored by members of Ayala's organization and \"decked\" (i.e., prepared for distribution) by Ayala's confederates &#8212; including appellants Walter Bat&#237;z-Rivera (\"Bat&#237;z\"), Ventura, Andr&#233;s, and Andr&#233;s's brother, appellant Angel Manuel Garc&#237;a-Torres (\"Manuel\"). The drugs were then distributed by these persons and others to places in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Locally, Ayala supplied and controlled distribution sites (called \"points\") which were \"owned\" (i.e., run) by individual dealers. Several of these points were located near housing projects in and around the city of Ponce. For example, the point at Atocha was owned by Edward Mel&#233;ndez-Negr&#243;n, a.k.a. Danny Gongolon (\"Gongolon\"). The point at Los Lirios del Sur housing project was owned by P&#233;rez-Col&#243;n, and the point at Tibes belonged to Ayala herself. Of particular significance to these appeals, the La Cantera drug point belonged to Tommy Garc&#237;a-Torres (\"Tommy\"), the brother of Andr&#233;s and Manuel, until August 1995 when he was murdered. The La Cantera drug point was then \"inherited\" by Manuel and Ventura.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ayala's drug distribution network and the various drug points were maintained through violence or threatened violence, and a number of killings took place over several years. The network processed hundreds of kilos of cocaine and generated a sizeable amount of cash receipts. Ayala, along with her coconspirators, concealed these sums of cash by money laundering them through the purchase of goods and services, in particular air conditioners and expensive vehicles that were registered under different names.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1997, a grand jury returned a superceding indictment alleging, inter alia, that from mid-1994 to mid-1997, seventy-six individually named defendants participated in a conspiracy to distribute illegal narcotics (Count I). <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846. The indictment also alleged that twenty-nine of these defendants conspired to launder money (Count II). <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a), (h). The vast majority of the defendants pleaded guilty and were sentenced to lengthy prison terms. The four appellants herein, together with Ayala, P&#233;rez-Col&#243;n, and Marcos Mart&#237;nez-Medina (\"Mart&#237;nez\"), were convicted following a jury trial that lasted over forty days. The jury found appellants Andr&#233;s and Manuel guilty on Counts I and II (drug conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy), and appellants Ventura and Bat&#237;z on Count I (drug conspiracy) only. Andr&#233;s and Manuel were sentenced on each count to twenty years of imprisonment, the terms to be served consecutively, for a total of forty years of imprisonment. Ventura and Bat&#237;z were each sentenced to twenty years for their convictions on Count I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andr&#233;s and Manuel were convicted in Count II of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a)(1) Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A)(i) with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity; <i>or</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">shall be sentenced to a fine ... or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Subsection (A)(i) can be described as the \"promotion\" element of the statute, and subsection (B)(i) can be described as the \"concealment\" element of the statute. As the statute unambiguously indicates, a conviction may be predicated on <i>either</i> the promotion prong <i>or</i> the concealment prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The superceding indictment in this case alleged that Andr&#233;s and Manuel, in conjunction with others, conspired to violate &#167; 1956, with the language of the indictment closely tracking that of the statute with one exception. The indictment alleged that Andr&#233;s and Manuel had conspired to conduct unlawful financial transactions \"with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity <i>and</i> knowing that the transactions [were] designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity\" (emphasis added). Thus, while the statute puts the promotion and concealment elements of &#167; 1956 in the disjunctive, the indictment alleged them in the conjunctive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, for its part, properly instructed the jury in the disjunctive:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1956(a)(1) of Title 18 of the United States Code makes it a crime to, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conduct or attempt to conduct a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One, with the intent to promote the carrying on of a specified unlawful activity; <i>or</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two, knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part to conceal the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). Andr&#233;s and Manuel now argue that it was reversible error for the district court to instruct the jury in the disjunctive while the indictment alleged the violation of &#167; 1956 in the conjunctive. Moreover, the argument goes, if the district court had properly instructed the jury in the conjunctive, the government would have had to prove <i>both</i> the concealment prong and the promotion prong beyond a reasonable doubt. Andr&#233;s and Manuel claim that the government did not adduce any evidence on the concealment prong, and, therefore, they are entitled to have their conviction reversed on the money laundering count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating this claim, we first note that Andr&#233;s and Manuel failed to object to the jury instruction they now say was erroneous. Hence their argument about the jury instruction has been forfeited. <i>See United States v. Paniagua-Ramos,</i> 251 F.3d 242, 246 (1st Cir.2001) (\"[I]t is settled beyond peradventure that a party's failure to object to the charge in strict conformity with the prerequisites of Rule 30 forfeits most instructional errors.\"). Although the appellants can still invoke plain error review, this standard is notoriously difficult to meet.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To vault this hurdle, a defendant must make four showings. First, he must show that an error occurred. Second, he must show that the error was clear or obvious. Third, he must show that the error affected his substantial rights. Fourth, he must show that the error so seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of the proceedings as to threaten a miscarriage of justice.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.; see Johnson v. United States,</i> 520 U.S. 461, 466-67, 117 S.Ct. 1544, 137 L.Ed.2d 718 (1997); <i>United States v. Olano,</i> 507 U.S. 725, 732, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While we have not previously had occasion to consider the argument presented by Andr&#233;s and Manuel, the Ninth Circuit has. In <i>United States v. Booth,</i> 309 F.3d 566 (9th Cir.2002), the defendant was convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a)(1). The indictment had \"alleged conjunctively that [the defendant] conducted the unlawful financial transactions `with the intent to promote the carrying on of the specified unlawful activity <i>and</i> knowing that the transaction was designed ... to conceal and disguise' the proceeds.\" <i>Booth,</i> 309 F.3d at 571-72 (modifications in original). At the close of the trial, however, the court instructed the jury in the disjunctive: \"the jury was permitted to convict if it found that [the defendant] had conducted the money laundering transactions <i>either</i> with the intent to promote the unlawful activity <i>or</i> knowing that the transactions were designed to conceal.\" <i>Id.</i> at 572.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the Ninth Circuit succinctly put it, \"[t]here was no reversible error in this sequence of events.\" <i>Id.</i> \"Quite simply, the law is well established that where an indictment charges in the conjunctive several means of violating a statute, a conviction may be obtained on proof of only one of the means, and accordingly the jury instruction may properly be framed in the disjunctive.\" <i>United States v. Simpson,</i> 228 F.3d 1294, 1300 (11th Cir.2000). As we indicated over thirty years ago in <i>United States v. Barbato,</i> 471 F.2d 918 (1st Cir.1973), a prosecution for fraud under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1010:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Where a statute ... sets forth several different means by which an offense may be committed, it is permissible for a count in an indictment to allege all or several of these means in the conjunctive. A conviction on such a count will stand if the evidence establishing one or more of the means of commission alleged is sufficient to support a jury verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>United States v. Barbato,</i> 471 F.2d 918, 922 n. 3 (1st Cir.1973); <i>see also United States v. Miller,</i> 471 U.S. 130, 134-38, 105 S.Ct. 1811, 85 L.Ed.2d 99 (1985) (indicating that, if indictment gave clear notice of charges, there is no reversible error when jury convicts on proof of only one of several means of committing crime alleged in the indictment). As a result, \"proof of any one of those acts conjunctively charged may support a conviction.\" <i>United States</i> <i>v. LeDonne,</i> 21 F.3d 1418, 1427 (7th Cir. 1994); <i>United States v. Fontana,</i> 948 F.2d 796, 802 (1st Cir.1991). There was no error in the jury instruction on the crime of money laundering. Andr&#233;s and Manuel concede that the government presented sufficient evidence to satisfy the promotion prong of &#167; 1956. We therefore affirm the convictions of Andr&#233;s and Manuel on Count II.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Following their convictions but prior to sentencing, all four appellants, together with Mart&#237;nez, moved for a new trial under <i>Brady v. Maryland,</i> 373 U.S. 83, 83 S.Ct. 1194, 10 L.Ed.2d 215 (1963), claiming that the government had improperly withheld a sworn statement containing exculpatory and impeachment evidence. In July 1999 the district court conducted a two-day evidentiary hearing on the motion. In a thorough opinion and order dated May 18, 2000, the district court denied the request for a new trial. The appellants now assign error to this ruling. Before addressing the appellants' claim of error, however, we must first describe in some depth the evidence presented at trial concerning the murders of Michael and Eddie V&#225;zquez, an event that is central to the new trial motion. Many of the facts described below have already been recounted in <i>Mart&#237;nez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d at 112-13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the La Cantera drug point, a dispute arose in 1994 when Tommy (the brother of Andr&#233;s and Manuel) fired \"Gerardito,\" his brother-in-law and a drug runner, for having allegedly stolen over $35,000 in drug proceeds. Following his ouster, Gerardito and his brother \"Nelsito\" began to associate with Michael V&#225;zquez (\"Michael\") and his father Eddie V&#225;zquez (\"Eddie\"). While the V&#225;zquezes had no demonstrated connection with the drug trade, they did have a sizable cache of weapons and were willing to help Gerardito seek revenge against the Garc&#237;a brothers. A violent feud soon developed with the Garc&#237;as and their allies (including Ventura, Ayala, Mart&#237;nez, Bat&#237;z, and Gongolon) on one side, and Gerardito and his faction (including Nelsito, the V&#225;zquezes, and the V&#225;zquezes' employee, Jos&#233; Negr&#243;n-Santiago, a.k.a. \"Bejumen\") on the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next few years, this rivalry turned deadly. In 1995 Tommy and a confrere were murdered in separate incidents. That same year, a friend of Gerardito, \"Gordo,\" was also murdered. Each side blamed the other. The following year, Eddie shot and wounded Gongolon. The ongoing violence targeted the drug points of the Garc&#237;a faction and caused the Garc&#237;a brothers and their colleagues to fear that Gerardito's clan was bent on revenge and the takeover of their business. Moreover, the violence at the points had attracted the attention of the local police, causing sales figures to drop. So, from 1995 to 1997, the Garc&#237;a brothers and their colleagues repeatedly attempted to find and kill Gerardito, Nelsito, the V&#225;zquezes, and Bejumen to put an end to it all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They eventually succeeded. On February 14, 1997, Bejumen and his wife were shot and killed in their automobile. Gamaliel Goglas-Valentin (\"Goglas\"), an auto shop employee who also stored drugs and guns for the Garc&#237;as, testified at trial that Andr&#233;s, Manuel, and Mart&#237;nez drove into his shop and celebrated openly that they had \"finally got the bastard,\" Bejumen. He also testified that Andr&#233;s reported that the three of them had ambushed Bejumen's car, and that Mart&#237;nez and Andr&#233;s then opened the car door and shot Bejumen and his wife repeatedly at close range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danny Gongolon testified at trial that a few days after Bejumen's murder, Ventura approached Gongolon and told him that Manuel knew some kidnappers who knew where the V&#225;zquezes lived. For a $20,000 fee, these kidnappers were willing to pose as police officers and \"arrest\" Michael and turn him over to the Garc&#237;a faction. The $20,000 price tag was to be split among Manuel, Gongolon, Ventura, and Ayala. At a meeting later that day, Gongolon, Andr&#233;s, Manuel, Ventura, and Bat&#237;z made plans to carry out the abduction and murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we indicated in <i>Mart&#237;nez-Medina,</i> what happened next is not altogether clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the testimony of various witnesses is somewhat unclear as to the precise chain of events, it appears that the kidnappers handed Michael V&#225;zquez over to associates of the Garc&#237;a group &#8212; including Manuel and Andr&#233;s Garc&#237;a, Gongolon, Ventura, and Bat&#237;z &#8212; who drove away with him and killed him. They also found and shot Eddie V&#225;zquez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">279 F.3d at 112. Goglas testified that the morning after the V&#225;zquez murders, Manuel and Ventura came to his shop to have him repair bullet damage to their vehicle. At that time, Manuel and Ventura recounted the V&#225;zquez murders to him. A couple of weeks afterwards, he ran into Andr&#233;s who also spoke of his role in the abduction and murders. Gongolon testified that immediately after the V&#225;zquez killings, he called Ayala to announce that he had some good news; he also told her to prepare breakfast and that he would be right over. He then drove to Ayala's house and immediately told her of the V&#225;zquezes' deaths. Ayala expressed elation at the news, and after breakfast she drove to the scene of the murders to see for herself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Purported Brady Material</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion for a new trial is based on a sworn statement by Jaime Morales-Rivera (\"Morales\") that was given to the Puerto Rico state prosecutor in May 1998 during the course of an investigation into the V&#225;zquez murders. The appellants first learned of the existence of Morales's statement at a preliminary hearing in the state prosecution of Manuel and Ventura for the V&#225;zquez murders, four months after the verdict had been entered against them in the federal case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the statement, Morales declared that he joined the Puerto Rico police in 1992. While an officer, he participated in various criminal activities, including burglary, kidnapping, murder, and planting of evidence. For example, Morales assisted Jos&#233; Galiany-Cruz (\"Galiany\") in an attempt to kidnap someone on behalf of Galiany's employer, Santos Mart&#237;nez (\"Santos\"), a drug dealer apparently unconnected to Ayala and the Garc&#237;as.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his statement, Morales goes on to say that Galiany approached him about another job for Santos in February 1997 involving the kidnapping of someone whose father, according to Galiany, owed Santos four million dollars. That \"someone\" turned out to be Michael V&#225;zquez, whose father was Eddie V&#225;zquez. The statement then provides details of Morales's involvement in Michael's abduction and murder. While Morales's account of what happened the night of the V&#225;zquez murders varied in some minor ways from the testimony presented at trial, the substance of his testimony did not vary significantly from the testimony of Goglas and Gongolon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. The Motion for a New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon learning of the existence of the statement, appellants Andr&#233;s, Manuel, Ventura, Bat&#237;z, and co-defendant Mart&#237;nez all moved for a new trial. They claimed that the government had intentionally withheld the statement and that it contained exculpatory and impeachment evidence of such probative value that it undermined confidence in the verdict. According to the defendants, the statement was exculpatory because it demonstrated that the V&#225;zquez murders were not part of the conspiracy charged in this case, and because it could be used to impeach the testimony of Gongolon and Goglas regarding the defendants' involvement in the Bejumen and V&#225;zquez murders. In response, the government conceded that it was in possession of the sworn statement well before the start of trial and that it should have been divulged to the defendants. The government maintained, however, that the withholding of the evidence was unintentional and not in bad faith. Moreover, according to the government, the statement would have been ultimately inadmissible and/or immaterial, and, therefore, its absence did not undermine confidence in the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court conducted a two-day hearing which included testimony from Morales, Galiany, the local district attorney, and an FBI agent assigned to the case. Galiany testified that he had been approached by Manuel who told him that he was having problems with Michael and Eddie V&#225;zquez, and that Manuel suggested a plan in which Galiany would kidnap them and turn them over to Manuel so that he could kill them. Galiany then contacted Morales and relayed to him the plan which they eventually executed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing, Galiany admitted to having told Morales that he had been contracted by Santos. Galiany went on to testify, however, that he had told Morales this lie in order to protect the identity of the person who had actually hired him &#8212; Manuel. The substance of Morales's testimony at the hearing was the same as contained in his prior sworn statement, with a few additional details concerning the abduction of Michael V&#225;zquez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, after asking for post-hearing briefing, denied the motion for a new trial in an exhaustive opinion and order that dismissed the impeachment and exculpatory value of Morales's statement, determined that the government had not withheld the evidence in bad faith, and raised serious questions about the evidence's admissibility. For purposes of its analysis, however, the court assumed that the evidence would be admissible. The court then concluded that the probative value of the evidence did not merit a new trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the rest of the evidence about defendants' involvement in the charged conspiracy, the Court finds that even in the absence of the Morales [] statement[,] defendants received a fair trial which resulted in a confidence-worthy verdict. Contrary to their contention, the V&#225;zquezes murders was not the only evidence the government had to link defendants to the charged conspiracy. At trial, the government presented the testimony, among others, of unindicted coconspirator [Goglas], who testified about the participation of [Mart&#237;nez], Manuel and [Andr&#233;s] in the murders of rival gang member Bejumen and his wife. Evidence was also presented of Manuel, [Andr&#233;s] and [Ventura's] drug dealings with Angela Ayala-Mart&#237;nez. The evidence also established that [Bat&#237;z] used to work for [Ventura] and Manuel decking drugs at La Cantera drug point.

Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants claim that, notwithstanding our earlier rejection of Mart&#237;nez's <i>Brady</i> claim, they are entitled to a new trial because Morales's statement would have had different consequences for them than for Mart&#237;nez. They assert that the principal prosecution witness against them was Goglas, and that his testimony concerning their involvement in the Bejumen and V&#225;zquez murders provided \"the main link between appellants and the Angela Ayala conspiracy.\" They claim that Morales's statement sufficiently undermines Goglas's testimony regarding both sets of murders as to make all of his testimony unreliable. As for the V&#225;zquez murders, they insist that Morales's statement would have demonstrated that their involvement in them was only the result of a grudge and not the Ayala conspiracy. Therefore, they claim, the withheld evidence sufficiently undermines confidence in the verdict to warrant a new trial. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted in Mart&#237;nez's case, the exculpatory and/or impeachment value (if any) of Morales's statement only directly pertains to the V&#225;zquez murders. As the district court noted, if the appellants had managed to get the Morales statement admitted into evidence (a questionable proposition), the government would have then been entitled to call Galiany as a witness, and Galiany would have likely testified (as he did at the <i>Brady</i> hearing) that he had fabricated the story about Santos having ordered the kidnapping in order to keep Morales from learning that the Garc&#237;a group was behind the plan. Moreover, any impeachment value of the statement, as the district court noted, would have been minimal since the deviations in substance concerning the mechanics of the V&#225;zquez murders were negligible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, as the district court noted in its opinion, the V&#225;zquez and Bejumen murders were hardly the only evidence linking Andr&#233;s, Manuel, and Ventura with the Ayala drug distribution network. There was testimony from other witnesses that cash and drugs repeatedly exchanged hands among these three appellants and Ayala, and that Andr&#233;s and Ventura helped Ayala retrieve airdropped drugs from the sea. Witnesses also testified about the control Ventura and Manuel exercised over the La Cantera drug point, as well as the intimate role that Bat&#237;z played in La Cantera's administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the appellants exploited other opportunities to attack Goglas's credibility, such as his inconsistencies and omissions between his trial and grand jury testimony. Therefore, in light of the weak evidentiary value of Morales's statement, and the substantial other evidence of the appellants' involvement in the conspiracy, we cannot say that the government's failure to produce the Morales statement \"undermine[s][our] confidence in the verdict.\" <i>Mart&#237;nez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d at 126 (quoting <i>Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 435, 115 S.Ct. 1555). The district court properly denied the appellants' motions for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants make three arguments related to their sentencing. Manuel and Andr&#233;s claim that the sentencing court erred in failing to group the drug conspiracy and the money laundering convictions under section 3D1.2 of the Guidelines. They also claim that the court erred in sentencing them to the statutory maximum on the money laundering count. Finally, Manuel and Bat&#237;z claim that the court erred when it sentenced them without the benefit of an updated Pre-Sentence Report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Grouping</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3D1.2 of the Guidelines provides that closely related counts should be \"grouped\" for purposes of sentencing. Manuel and Andr&#233;s's respective Pre-Sentence Reports (\"PSR\") contained identical paragraphs regarding the grouping of their convictions on Count I (drug conspiracy) and Count II (money laundering conspiracy): Offense conduct comprising drug trafficking and money laundering are normally grouped together into a combined group as the offense conduct involves substantially the same harm within the meaning of Guideline &#167; 3D1.2(b); to wit: the counts involve the same victim (society) and two or more acts or transactions connected by a common criminal objective or constituting part of a common scheme or plan. However, the offense conduct comprising count one not only involved generalized drug trafficking activities, but also involved murder. As such, the two counts are not groupable under the provisions of Guideline &#167; 3D1.2 and are treated as to [sic] distinct counts to be grouped under the provisions of Guideline &#167; 3D1.4, Determining the Combined Offense Level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants objected to this reasoning, arguing that Counts I and II should have been grouped according to the plain language of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2(c) and (d),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and they renew this argument on appeal. The government, citing no authority, responds by simply stating that since the drug conspiracy involved murder, Count I was somehow \"exempt\" from grouping under any provision of the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These arguments reflect a shared failure by appellants and the government to understand that the district court did, in fact, group the two counts for sentencing purposes. The misunderstanding apparently arises because of the court's imposition of consecutive sentences, which the appellants and the government interpret as a rejection of \"grouping.\" There was no such rejection by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in Manuel's sentencing hearing, the court indicated its inclination to adopt the factual findings of the PSR with respect to Count I. Relying on the guideline for a drug conspiracy, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(3), the court calculated a base offense level of 38 since the offense of conviction involved more than 150 kilograms of cocaine. Then the court indicated that it was inclined to add a four-level enhancement pursuant to &#167; 3B1.1(a) because of Manuel's leadership role; a two-level enhancement pursuant to &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) because of his possession of dangerous weapons during the offense; and a two-level enhancement pursuant to &#167; 3C1.1 because of his attempts to obstruct justice in connection with police investigations into the Bejumen and V&#225;zquez murders, resulting in an adjusted offense level (\"AOL\") of 46. Given that the maximum possible offense level under the Guidelines is 43, the court stated that it was inclined to use that number. According to the Sentencing Table in Part 5 of the Guidelines, an AOL of 43 results in a guideline sentencing range (\"GSR\") of life in prison, irrespective of criminal history.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The court said nothing about an offense level for Count II. The court did state, however, that it was inclined to exercise its \"discretion\" under &#167; 5G1.2(d) and impose the statutory maximum sentence (20 years) on each count, the terms to run consecutively.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The court then heard from counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Manuel raised many objections to the court's sentencing rationale, all of which were overruled. In particular, he argued &#8212; in an apparent reference to the imposition of consecutive sentences &#8212; that the court had to \"group\" the two counts for sentencing and hence could not impose consecutive sentences. The sentencing court responded with an explanation that reflected a clear understanding of the rules of grouping, as that term of art is used in &#167; 3D1.2:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding consecutive sentences, <i>the guidelines provide and it is mandatory that we group counts 1 and 2 for sentencing purposes we have no discretion in that sense. We are mandated by the guidelines to group them together.</i> To determine the maximum guideline range of the 2 counts and than [sic] apply that guideline range. <i>In this case what the court proposes to do, and according to the findings that I just stated, we group counts 1 and 2 as mandated by the guidelines.</i> We determine the guideline range for count one which gives a guideline range of life. That is the highest guideline range for both counts. Count one, the maximum statutory is 20 years,... the court will not impose over 20 years regarding count 1. Regarding count two, the guideline range is life imprisonment, it is the same guideline sentencing range.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> However the statutory maximum is 20 years. So we will apply the statutory maximum. That is how this court has arrived at those sentencing maximums. Regarding the consecutive part, we believe this court is authorized under section 5G1 of the guidelines to provide that these sentences be consecutive in order to provide that the total punishment of these guidelines be complied as much as possible within the statutory maximums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). Under the relevant \"grouping\" section of the Guidelines, &#167; 3D1.3(a), \"the offense level applicable to a Group is the offense level ... for the most serious of the counts comprising the Group.\" The district court's decision to focus on Count I, and only calculate an AOL and GSR for that count, is therefore consistent with the rules regarding grouping.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Hence, contrary to Manuel's position on appeal, the district court did not fail to \"group\" Counts I and II for sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> As far as we can tell, Manuel's grievance is with the court's decision to impose consecutive rather than concurrent sentences, apparently on the theory that grouping precludes consecutive sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 5G1.2(d) of the Guidelines provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is less than the total punishment, then the sentence imposed on one or more of the other counts shall run consecutively, but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment. In all other respects, sentences on all counts shall run concurrently, except to the extent otherwise required by law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The \"total punishment,\" as described in this section, \"is the sentence arrived at for all counts through application of the Guidelines, including determination of the base offense levels, application of grouping provisions, and calculation of other adjustments.\" <i>United States v. Lott,</i> 310 F.3d 1231, 1242 (10th Cir.2002). The sentencing court fixes this \"total punishment\" somewhere within the applicable GSR. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.2, comment. (n.1) (\"The combined length of the sentences (`total punishment') is determined by the court after determining the adjusted combined offense level and the Criminal History Category.\"). Since Manuel's GSR was not truly a range, but rather \"life\" only, the sentencing court had no option but to fix Manuel's \"total punishment\" at life imprisonment. However, the two counts on which Manuel's conviction rested each had a statutory maximum sentence of only twenty years. The sentencing court indicated that it would therefore exercise its \"discretion\" under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.2(d) and impose sentences on the two counts consecutively in order to get as close to a life term as possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like every other circuit that has considered the issue, we have previously stated that the language of &#167; 5G1.2(d) &#8212; indicating that sentences \"<i>shall</i> run consecutively\" (emphasis added) &#8212; is mandatory in order to achieve, to the greatest extent possible, a combined sentence \"equal to the total punishment.\" <i>United States v. Saccoccia,</i> 58 F.3d 754, 787 (1st Cir.1995); <i>see United States v.

Chase,</i> 296 F.3d 247, 251 (4th Cir.2002). As explained persuasively in <i>Chase,</i> \"grouping and stacking are separate concepts relevant in different stages of the sentencing process.\" <i>Chase,</i> 296 F.3d. at 251. Grouping is one of the first steps undertaken during the sentencing process, and is done \"[i]n order to limit the significance of the formal charging decision and to prevent multiple punishment for substantially identical offense conduct,\" U.S.S.G. ch. 3, pt. D, intro. comment. In fact, the grouping of counts will often result in an appreciably lower offense level and correspondingly lower GSR than if the counts had not been grouped. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Sedoma,</i> 332 F.3d 20, 23-24 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the sentencing court has determined the offense level (including all upward and downward adjustments) &#8212; whether for a group of counts, a combination of individual counts, or multiple groups &#8212; then, as explained above, the court fixes the \"total punishment\" within the applicable GSR. While grouping plays a critical role in these early stages of the sentencing calculus, once the court has fixed the \"total punishment\" somewhere within the GSR, the Guidelines provide no further role for grouping in the sentencing process. If one of the underlying counts of conviction has a statutory maximum sentence greater than or equal to the \"total punishment,\" the court will then impose the \"total punishment\" on that count, with sentences on any other counts running concurrently. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.2(d). If, however, none of the underlying counts of conviction have a statutory maximum sentence greater than or equal to the \"total punishment,\" the Guidelines mandate the imposition of consecutive sentences in order to achieve (as close as possible) the \"total punishment.\" <i>See id.</i> Hence, \"as a purely logical matter, there is no obstacle to stacking a defendant's sentences for grouped offenses.\" <i>Chase,</i> 296 F.3d at 251.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts have repeatedly held that grouped counts may be \"stacked\" at sentencing. <i>See id.; see also Lott,</i> 310 F.3d at 1242 (indicating that sentencing court must apply &#167; 5G1.2(d) on grouped counts); <i>United States v. Miller,</i> 295 F.3d 824, 828 (8th Cir.2002) (affirming consecutive sentences on grouped counts); <i>United States v. Gordon,</i> 291 F.3d 181, 195 (2d Cir.2002) (indicating that grouped counts may be stacked); <i>United States v. McWaine,</i> 290 F.3d 269, 274 n. 4 (5th Cir.2002) (affirming consecutive sentences on grouped counts); <i>United States v. Buckland,</i> 289 F.3d 558, 572 (9th Cir.2002) (en banc) (same); <i>United States v. Griffith,</i> 85 F.3d 284, 289 n. 2 (7th Cir.1996) (indicating same in dicta); <i>United States v. Perez,</i> 956 F.2d 1098, 1102-03 (11th Cir.1992) (affirming consecutive sentences on grouped counts). Indeed, we have already indicated in dicta that the grouping of counts poses no bar to the imposition of consecutive sentences when necessary to achieve a combined sentence equivalent to the total punishment. <i>See United States v. Hernandez-Coplin,</i> 24 F.3d 312, 320 n. 9 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we agree with the <i>Chase</i> court that the stacking of grouped offenses furthers the policies underlying the Guidelines. The Guidelines were intended, in part, to create \"a system that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of differing severity.\" U.S.S.G. ch. 1, pt. A(3). However, \"[i]f stacking for grouped offenses were prohibited, then two defendants guilty of multiple crimes might receive roughly the same sentence even though one was subject to a higher guideline range as a result of more harmful conduct or a more egregious criminal history.\" <i>Chase,</i> 296 F.3d at 253.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the plain language of the Guidelines contemplates that consecutive sentences may be imposed on grouped counts; it has been the practice of other courts to do so; and such a practice furthers the policies underlying the Guidelines. We therefore conclude that the grouping of Counts I and II did not preclude the imposition of consecutive sentences on the grouped offenses, and we affirm Manuel's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Andr&#233;s's sentencing hearing (which occurred immediately after Manuel's), the court followed the same approach. It alluded to the PSR's claim that the two counts should not be grouped, but, ultimately, the court did group them when it calculated the GSR by looking only to Count I. The court determined that the base offense level for Count I, as in Manuel's case, was 38. The court then made a two-level adjustment for weapons possession, and arrived at an AOL of 40. Cross-referencing to a CHC of III, the court arrived at a GSR of 360 months to life. The court determined that within that range, a total punishment of life was appropriate \"due to all the facts of this case[,] the defendant[']s participation, his disregard for life, for murders and all of the other incidents that this court saw throughout the three months of trial.\" Having thus fixed the total punishment at life, the district court was obligated under &#167; 5G1.2(d), as it was in Manuel's case, to impose a 20-year sentence (the statutory maximum) on each count, the sentences to run consecutively. We discern no error in the sentencing of Andr&#233;s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Money Laundering Count</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Manuel and Andr&#233;s argue that the sentencing court erred when it sentenced them to the maximum term on the money laundering count \"without making any particularized findings of fact\" regarding the value of the funds laundered. As explained in the preceding section, however, the district court made no findings whatsoever on the money laundering count because the court grouped the two counts and calculated Manuel and Andr&#233;s's GSRs only according to its findings on the \"most serious\" count, i.e., the drug count. Once the court determined the total punishment for Manuel and Andr&#233;s, it was then obligated to sentence them to the statutory maximum on each count, and impose those sentences consecutively, in order to achieve a final sentence that most closely approximated that total punishment. Thus, if the district court had made particularized findings on the money laundering count, they would have had no effect on the ultimate sentence imposed. We therefore reject this assignment of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The \"Post-Sentence\" Report</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants Manuel<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and Bat&#237;z argue that the trial court erred when it sentenced them without the benefit of an updated PSR. Initial PSRs for Manuel and Bat&#237;z were prepared by the Probation Office on April 20, 1999. Because of various post-trial motions, including some based on <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), their sentencing was postponed until December 2001. Manuel and Bat&#237;z also lodged several objections to the PSR's calculations. At their sentencing, they objected to a murder cross-reference on Count I, and, in the case of Manuel, certain findings regarding Count II. As indicated in Part IV.A, <i>supra,</i> however, the court ultimately did not apply a murder cross-reference on Count I, and with regard to Manuel's sentencing, the court made no findings on Count II since the court grouped that count with Count I. A month after the court had imposed its sentence, the probation office issued updated PSRs that no longer reflected the murder cross-reference. Manuel and Bat&#237;z claim that, as a result of the issuance of this \"Post-Sentence Report\" (as they call it), they are entitled to be resentenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The version of Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in effect at the time of sentencing provided in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probation officer must make a presentence investigation and submit a report to the court before the sentence is imposed, unless:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) the court finds that the information in the record enables it to exercise its sentencing authority meaningfully under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) the court explains this finding on the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b)(1) (2001).

At the sentencing hearing the court indicated that it was setting the offense levels on Count I based on its recollections of the evidence presented at trial, and on the factual findings contained in the original PSRs. The court was aware of the defendants' objections to those factual findings, and the court overruled them. As explained above, the court ignored the PSRs' cross-referencing of murder. The fact that a subsequent PSR, completed post-sentencing, reflected the court's decision, is simply irrelevant. The court had sufficient information before it \"to exercise its sentencing authority meaningfully,\" and we therefore affirm the sentences imposed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>V.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p77\">\n      <span class=\"num\">77</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we <i>AFFIRM</i> the convictions and sentences of all four appellants.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p78\">\n      <span class=\"num\">78</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>SO ORDERED.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> Three of the appellants (Andr&#233;s Garc&#237;a-Torres, Angel Manuel Garc&#237;a-Torres, and Walter Bat&#237;z-Rivera) have, through counsel, filed a consolidated brief.

The appellants were all convicted at trial and sentenced to lengthy prison terms. They make various assignments of error with regard to the jury charge, a post-trial denial of a motion for a new trial on <i>Brady</i> grounds, and sentencing.

Through contacts in Colombia, Ayala would arrange for large quantities of drugs to be air-dropped into the ocean off the coast of Puerto Rico. She would then send several of her associates &#8212; including Manuel P&#233;rez-Col&#243;n (\"P&#233;rez-Col&#243;n\") and appellants Andr&#233;s Garc&#237;a-Torres (\"Andr&#233;s\") and Deri Ventura-Garc&#237;a (\"Ventura\") &#8212; to recover the drugs from the ocean. The drugs would then be stored by members of Ayala's organization and \"decked\" (i.e., prepared for distribution) by Ayala's confederates &#8212; including appellants Walter Bat&#237;z-Rivera (\"Bat&#237;z\"), Ventura, Andr&#233;s, and Andr&#233;s's brother, appellant Angel Manuel Garc&#237;a-Torres (\"Manuel\"). The drugs were then distributed by these persons and others to places in Puerto Rico and elsewhere in the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Locally, Ayala supplied and controlled distribution sites (called \"points\") which were \"owned\" (i.e., run) by individual dealers. Several of these points were located near housing projects in and around the city of Ponce. For example, the point at Atocha was owned by Edward Mel&#233;ndez-Negr&#243;n, a.k.a. Danny Gongolon (\"Gongolon\"). The point at Los Lirios del Sur housing project was owned by P&#233;rez-Col&#243;n, and the point at Tibes belonged to Ayala herself. Of particular significance to these appeals, the La Cantera drug point belonged to Tommy Garc&#237;a-Torres (\"Tommy\"), the brother of Andr&#233;s and Manuel, until August 1995 when he was murdered. The La Cantera drug point was then \"inherited\" by Manuel and Ventura.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ayala's drug distribution network and the various drug points were maintained through violence or threatened violence, and a number of killings took place over several years. The network processed hundreds of kilos of cocaine and generated a sizeable amount of cash receipts. Ayala, along with her coconspirators, concealed these sums of cash by money laundering them through the purchase of goods and services, in particular air conditioners and expensive vehicles that were registered under different names.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In December 1997, a grand jury returned a superceding indictment alleging, inter alia, that from mid-1994 to mid-1997, seventy-six individually named defendants participated in a conspiracy to distribute illegal narcotics (Count I). <i>See</i> 21 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 841(a)(1), 846. The indictment also alleged that twenty-nine of these defendants conspired to launder money (Count II). <i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956(a), (h). The vast majority of the defendants pleaded guilty and were sentenced to lengthy prison terms. The four appellants herein, together with Ayala, P&#233;rez-Col&#243;n, and Marcos Mart&#237;nez-Medina (\"Mart&#237;nez\"), were convicted following a jury trial that lasted over forty days. The jury found appellants Andr&#233;s and Manuel guilty on Counts I and II (drug conspiracy and money laundering conspiracy), and appellants Ventura and Bat&#237;z on Count I (drug conspiracy) only. Andr&#233;s and Manuel were sentenced on each count to twenty years of imprisonment, the terms to be served consecutively, for a total of forty years of imprisonment. Ventura and Bat&#237;z were each sentenced to twenty years for their convictions on Count I.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Andr&#233;s and Manuel were convicted in Count II of violating 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1956, which provides in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(a)(1) Whoever, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conducts or attempts to conduct such a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A)(i) with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity; <i>or</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">* * *</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part &#8212;</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(i) to conceal or disguise the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity....</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">shall be sentenced to a fine ... or imprisonment for not more than twenty years, or both.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\"><i>Id.</i> (emphasis added). Subsection (A)(i) can be described as the \"promotion\" element of the statute, and subsection (B)(i) can be described as the \"concealment\" element of the statute. As the statute unambiguously indicates, a conviction may be predicated on <i>either</i> the promotion prong <i>or</i> the concealment prong.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The superceding indictment in this case alleged that Andr&#233;s and Manuel, in conjunction with others, conspired to violate &#167; 1956, with the language of the indictment closely tracking that of the statute with one exception. The indictment alleged that Andr&#233;s and Manuel had conspired to conduct unlawful financial transactions \"with the intent to promote the carrying on of specified unlawful activity <i>and</i> knowing that the transactions [were] designed in whole or in part to conceal or disguise the nature, the source, the ownership, or the control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity\" (emphasis added). Thus, while the statute puts the promotion and concealment elements of &#167; 1956 in the disjunctive, the indictment alleged them in the conjunctive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, for its part, properly instructed the jury in the disjunctive:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1956(a)(1) of Title 18 of the United States Code makes it a crime to, knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity, conduct or attempt to conduct a financial transaction which in fact involves the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">One, with the intent to promote the carrying on of a specified unlawful activity; <i>or</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Two, knowing that the transaction is designed in whole or in part to conceal the nature, the location, the source, the ownership, or control of the proceeds of specified unlawful activity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). Andr&#233;s and Manuel now argue that it was reversible error for the district court to instruct the jury in the disjunctive while the indictment alleged the violation of &#167; 1956 in the conjunctive. Moreover, the argument goes, if the district court had properly instructed the jury in the conjunctive, the government would have had to prove <i>both</i> the concealment prong and the promotion prong beyond a reasonable doubt. Andr&#233;s and Manuel claim that the government did not adduce any evidence on the concealment prong, and, therefore, they are entitled to have their conviction reversed on the money laundering count.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In evaluating this claim, we first note that Andr&#233;s and Manuel failed to object to the jury instruction they now say was erroneous. Hence their argument about the jury instruction has been forfeited. <i>See United States v.

In July 1999 the district court conducted a two-day evidentiary hearing on the motion. In a thorough opinion and order dated May 18, 2000, the district court denied the request for a new trial. The appellants now assign error to this ruling. Before addressing the appellants' claim of error, however, we must first describe in some depth the evidence presented at trial concerning the murders of Michael and Eddie V&#225;zquez, an event that is central to the new trial motion. Many of the facts described below have already been recounted in <i>Mart&#237;nez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d at 112-13.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Factual Background</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the La Cantera drug point, a dispute arose in 1994 when Tommy (the brother of Andr&#233;s and Manuel) fired \"Gerardito,\" his brother-in-law and a drug runner, for having allegedly stolen over $35,000 in drug proceeds. Following his ouster, Gerardito and his brother \"Nelsito\" began to associate with Michael V&#225;zquez (\"Michael\") and his father Eddie V&#225;zquez (\"Eddie\"). While the V&#225;zquezes had no demonstrated connection with the drug trade, they did have a sizable cache of weapons and were willing to help Gerardito seek revenge against the Garc&#237;a brothers. A violent feud soon developed with the Garc&#237;as and their allies (including Ventura, Ayala, Mart&#237;nez, Bat&#237;z, and Gongolon) on one side, and Gerardito and his faction (including Nelsito, the V&#225;zquezes, and the V&#225;zquezes' employee, Jos&#233; Negr&#243;n-Santiago, a.k.a. \"Bejumen\") on the other.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Over the next few years, this rivalry turned deadly. In 1995 Tommy and a confrere were murdered in separate incidents. That same year, a friend of Gerardito, \"Gordo,\" was also murdered. Each side blamed the other. The following year, Eddie shot and wounded Gongolon. The ongoing violence targeted the drug points of the Garc&#237;a faction and caused the Garc&#237;a brothers and their colleagues to fear that Gerardito's clan was bent on revenge and the takeover of their business. Moreover, the violence at the points had attracted the attention of the local police, causing sales figures to drop. So, from 1995 to 1997, the Garc&#237;a brothers and their colleagues repeatedly attempted to find and kill Gerardito, Nelsito, the V&#225;zquezes, and Bejumen to put an end to it all.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">They eventually succeeded. On February 14, 1997, Bejumen and his wife were shot and killed in their automobile. Gamaliel Goglas-Valentin (\"Goglas\"), an auto shop employee who also stored drugs and guns for the Garc&#237;as, testified at trial that Andr&#233;s, Manuel, and Mart&#237;nez drove into his shop and celebrated openly that they had \"finally got the bastard,\" Bejumen. He also testified that Andr&#233;s reported that the three of them had ambushed Bejumen's car, and that Mart&#237;nez and Andr&#233;s then opened the car door and shot Bejumen and his wife repeatedly at close range.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Danny Gongolon testified at trial that a few days after Bejumen's murder, Ventura approached Gongolon and told him that Manuel knew some kidnappers who knew where the V&#225;zquezes lived. For a $20,000 fee, these kidnappers were willing to pose as police officers and \"arrest\" Michael and turn him over to the Garc&#237;a faction. The $20,000 price tag was to be split among Manuel, Gongolon, Ventura, and Ayala. At a meeting later that day, Gongolon, Andr&#233;s, Manuel, Ventura, and Bat&#237;z made plans to carry out the abduction and murder.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we indicated in <i>Mart&#237;nez-Medina,</i> what happened next is not altogether clear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the testimony of various witnesses is somewhat unclear as to the precise chain of events, it appears that the kidnappers handed Michael V&#225;zquez over to associates of the Garc&#237;a group &#8212; including Manuel and Andr&#233;s Garc&#237;a, Gongolon, Ventura, and Bat&#237;z &#8212; who drove away with him and killed him. They also found and shot Eddie V&#225;zquez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">279 F.3d at 112. Goglas testified that the morning after the V&#225;zquez murders, Manuel and Ventura came to his shop to have him repair bullet damage to their vehicle. At that time, Manuel and Ventura recounted the V&#225;zquez murders to him. A couple of weeks afterwards, he ran into Andr&#233;s who also spoke of his role in the abduction and murders. Gongolon testified that immediately after the V&#225;zquez killings, he called Ayala to announce that he had some good news; he also told her to prepare breakfast and that he would be right over. He then drove to Ayala's house and immediately told her of the V&#225;zquezes' deaths. Ayala expressed elation at the news, and after breakfast she drove to the scene of the murders to see for herself.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Purported Brady Material</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The motion for a new trial is based on a sworn statement by Jaime Morales-Rivera (\"Morales\") that was given to the Puerto Rico state prosecutor in May 1998 during the course of an investigation into the V&#225;zquez murders. The appellants first learned of the existence of Morales's statement at a preliminary hearing in the state prosecution of Manuel and Ventura for the V&#225;zquez murders, four months after the verdict had been entered against them in the federal case.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the statement, Morales declared that he joined the Puerto Rico police in 1992. While an officer, he participated in various criminal activities, including burglary, kidnapping, murder, and planting of evidence. For example, Morales assisted Jos&#233; Galiany-Cruz (\"Galiany\") in an attempt to kidnap someone on behalf of Galiany's employer, Santos Mart&#237;nez (\"Santos\"), a drug dealer apparently unconnected to Ayala and the Garc&#237;as.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In his statement, Morales goes on to say that Galiany approached him about another job for Santos in February 1997 involving the kidnapping of someone whose father, according to Galiany, owed Santos four million dollars. That \"someone\" turned out to be Michael V&#225;zquez, whose father was Eddie V&#225;zquez. The statement then provides details of Morales's involvement in Michael's abduction and murder. While Morales's account of what happened the night of the V&#225;zquez murders varied in some minor ways from the testimony presented at trial, the substance of his testimony did not vary significantly from the testimony of Goglas and Gongolon.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. The Motion for a New Trial</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Upon learning of the existence of the statement, appellants Andr&#233;s, Manuel, Ventura, Bat&#237;z, and co-defendant Mart&#237;nez all moved for a new trial. They claimed that the government had intentionally withheld the statement and that it contained exculpatory and impeachment evidence of such probative value that it undermined confidence in the verdict. According to the defendants, the statement was exculpatory because it demonstrated that the V&#225;zquez murders were not part of the conspiracy charged in this case, and because it could be used to impeach the testimony of Gongolon and Goglas regarding the defendants' involvement in the Bejumen and V&#225;zquez murders. In response, the government conceded that it was in possession of the sworn statement well before the start of trial and that it should have been divulged to the defendants. The government maintained, however, that the withholding of the evidence was unintentional and not in bad faith. Moreover, according to the government, the statement would have been ultimately inadmissible and/or immaterial, and, therefore, its absence did not undermine confidence in the verdict.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court conducted a two-day hearing which included testimony from Morales, Galiany, the local district attorney, and an FBI agent assigned to the case. Galiany testified that he had been approached by Manuel who told him that he was having problems with Michael and Eddie V&#225;zquez, and that Manuel suggested a plan in which Galiany would kidnap them and turn them over to Manuel so that he could kill them. Galiany then contacted Morales and relayed to him the plan which they eventually executed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the hearing, Galiany admitted to having told Morales that he had been contracted by Santos. Galiany went on to testify, however, that he had told Morales this lie in order to protect the identity of the person who had actually hired him &#8212; Manuel. The substance of Morales's testimony at the hearing was the same as contained in his prior sworn statement, with a few additional details concerning the abduction of Michael V&#225;zquez.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court, after asking for post-hearing briefing, denied the motion for a new trial in an exhaustive opinion and order that dismissed the impeachment and exculpatory value of Morales's statement, determined that the government had not withheld the evidence in bad faith, and raised serious questions about the evidence's admissibility. For purposes of its analysis, however, the court assumed that the evidence would be admissible. The court then concluded that the probative value of the evidence did not merit a new trial:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After reviewing the rest of the evidence about defendants' involvement in the charged conspiracy, the Court finds that even in the absence of the Morales [] statement[,] defendants received a fair trial which resulted in a confidence-worthy verdict. Contrary to their contention, the V&#225;zquezes murders was not the only evidence the government had to link defendants to the charged conspiracy. At trial, the government presented the testimony, among others, of unindicted coconspirator [Goglas], who testified about the participation of [Mart&#237;nez], Manuel and [Andr&#233;s] in the murders of rival gang member Bejumen and his wife. Evidence was also presented of Manuel, [Andr&#233;s] and [Ventura's] drug dealings with Angela Ayala-Mart&#237;nez. The evidence also established that [Bat&#237;z] used to work for [Ventura] and Manuel decking drugs at La Cantera drug point. All this evidence sufficiently established that defendants were part of the charged, and not a separate and distinct, conspiracy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In a previous appeal, we upheld the denial of the motion for a new trial with respect to defendant Mart&#237;nez, stating that Morales's statement did not directly undermine Goglas's testimony concerning Mart&#237;nez's involvement in Bejumen's murder &#8212; the murder that \"provided the main link between Mart&#237;nez and the drug conspiracy.\" <i>Mart&#237;nez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d at 126. Rather, Morales's statement went only to the V&#225;zquez murders. \"Such weak impeachment evidence,\" we indicated, \"on an issue tangential to the conviction is not sufficient to warrant the drastic remedy of a new trial.\" <i>Id.</i> at 127.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D.

Analysis</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants claim that, notwithstanding our earlier rejection of Mart&#237;nez's <i>Brady</i> claim, they are entitled to a new trial because Morales's statement would have had different consequences for them than for Mart&#237;nez. They assert that the principal prosecution witness against them was Goglas, and that his testimony concerning their involvement in the Bejumen and V&#225;zquez murders provided \"the main link between appellants and the Angela Ayala conspiracy.\" They claim that Morales's statement sufficiently undermines Goglas's testimony regarding both sets of murders as to make all of his testimony unreliable. As for the V&#225;zquez murders, they insist that Morales's statement would have demonstrated that their involvement in them was only the result of a grudge and not the Ayala conspiracy. Therefore, they claim, the withheld evidence sufficiently undermines confidence in the verdict to warrant a new trial. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As we noted in Mart&#237;nez's case, the exculpatory and/or impeachment value (if any) of Morales's statement only directly pertains to the V&#225;zquez murders. As the district court noted, if the appellants had managed to get the Morales statement admitted into evidence (a questionable proposition), the government would have then been entitled to call Galiany as a witness, and Galiany would have likely testified (as he did at the <i>Brady</i> hearing) that he had fabricated the story about Santos having ordered the kidnapping in order to keep Morales from learning that the Garc&#237;a group was behind the plan. Moreover, any impeachment value of the statement, as the district court noted, would have been minimal since the deviations in substance concerning the mechanics of the V&#225;zquez murders were negligible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Additionally, as the district court noted in its opinion, the V&#225;zquez and Bejumen murders were hardly the only evidence linking Andr&#233;s, Manuel, and Ventura with the Ayala drug distribution network. There was testimony from other witnesses that cash and drugs repeatedly exchanged hands among these three appellants and Ayala, and that Andr&#233;s and Ventura helped Ayala retrieve airdropped drugs from the sea. Witnesses also testified about the control Ventura and Manuel exercised over the La Cantera drug point, as well as the intimate role that Bat&#237;z played in La Cantera's administration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the appellants exploited other opportunities to attack Goglas's credibility, such as his inconsistencies and omissions between his trial and grand jury testimony. Therefore, in light of the weak evidentiary value of Morales's statement, and the substantial other evidence of the appellants' involvement in the conspiracy, we cannot say that the government's failure to produce the Morales statement \"undermine[s][our] confidence in the verdict.\" <i>Mart&#237;nez-Medina,</i> 279 F.3d at 126 (quoting <i>Kyles,</i> 514 U.S. at 435, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"117923\"><a href=\"/opinion/117923/kyles-v-whitley/\"><span class=\"volume\">115</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The district court properly denied the appellants' motions for a new trial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellants make three arguments related to their sentencing. Manuel and Andr&#233;s claim that the sentencing court erred in failing to group the drug conspiracy and the money laundering convictions under section 3D1.2 of the Guidelines. They also claim that the court erred in sentencing them to the statutory maximum on the money laundering count. Finally, Manuel and Bat&#237;z claim that the court erred when it sentenced them without the benefit of an updated Pre-Sentence Report.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Grouping</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 3D1.2 of the Guidelines provides that closely related counts should be \"grouped\" for purposes of sentencing. Manuel and Andr&#233;s's respective Pre-Sentence Reports (\"PSR\") contained identical paragraphs regarding the grouping of their convictions on Count I (drug conspiracy) and Count II (money laundering conspiracy): Offense conduct comprising drug trafficking and money laundering are normally grouped together into a combined group as the offense conduct involves substantially the same harm within the meaning of Guideline &#167; 3D1.2(b); to wit: the counts involve the same victim (society) and two or more acts or transactions connected by a common criminal objective or constituting part of a common scheme or plan. However, the offense conduct comprising count one not only involved generalized drug trafficking activities, but also involved murder. As such, the two counts are not groupable under the provisions of Guideline &#167; 3D1.2 and are treated as to [sic] distinct counts to be grouped under the provisions of Guideline &#167; 3D1.4, Determining the Combined Offense Level.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The defendants objected to this reasoning, arguing that Counts I and II should have been grouped according to the plain language of U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.2(c) and (d),<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> and they renew this argument on appeal. The government, citing no authority, responds by simply stating that since the drug conspiracy involved murder, Count I was somehow \"exempt\" from grouping under any provision of the Guidelines.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">These arguments reflect a shared failure by appellants and the government to understand that the district court did, in fact, group the two counts for sentencing purposes. The misunderstanding apparently arises because of the court's imposition of consecutive sentences, which the appellants and the government interpret as a rejection of \"grouping.\" There was no such rejection by the district court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Early in Manuel's sentencing hearing, the court indicated its inclination to adopt the factual findings of the PSR with respect to Count I. Relying on the guideline for a drug conspiracy, U.S.S.G. &#167; 2D1.1(c)(3), the court calculated a base offense level of 38 since the offense of conviction involved more than 150 kilograms of cocaine. Then the court indicated that it was inclined to add a four-level enhancement pursuant to &#167; 3B1.1(a) because of Manuel's leadership role; a two-level enhancement pursuant to &#167; 2D1.1(b)(1) because of his possession of dangerous weapons during the offense; and a two-level enhancement pursuant to &#167; 3C1.1 because of his attempts to obstruct justice in connection with police investigations into the Bejumen and V&#225;zquez murders, resulting in an adjusted offense level (\"AOL\") of 46. Given that the maximum possible offense level under the Guidelines is 43, the court stated that it was inclined to use that number. According to the Sentencing Table in Part 5 of the Guidelines, an AOL of 43 results in a guideline sentencing range (\"GSR\") of life in prison, irrespective of criminal history.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The court said nothing about an offense level for Count II. The court did state, however, that it was inclined to exercise its \"discretion\" under &#167; 5G1.2(d) and impose the statutory maximum sentence (20 years) on each count, the terms to run consecutively.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> The court then heard from counsel.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Manuel raised many objections to the court's sentencing rationale, all of which were overruled. In particular, he argued &#8212; in an apparent reference to the imposition of consecutive sentences &#8212; that the court had to \"group\" the two counts for sentencing and hence could not impose consecutive sentences. The sentencing court responded with an explanation that reflected a clear understanding of the rules of grouping, as that term of art is used in &#167; 3D1.2:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regarding consecutive sentences, <i>the guidelines provide and it is mandatory that we group counts 1 and 2 for sentencing purposes we have no discretion in that sense. We are mandated by the guidelines to group them together.</i> To determine the maximum guideline range of the 2 counts and than [sic] apply that guideline range. <i>In this case what the court proposes to do, and according to the findings that I just stated, we group counts 1 and 2 as mandated by the guidelines.</i> We determine the guideline range for count one which gives a guideline range of life. That is the highest guideline range for both counts. Count one, the maximum statutory is 20 years,... the court will not impose over 20 years regarding count 1. Regarding count two, the guideline range is life imprisonment, it is the same guideline sentencing range.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> However the statutory maximum is 20 years. So we will apply the statutory maximum. That is how this court has arrived at those sentencing maximums. Regarding the consecutive part, we believe this court is authorized under section 5G1 of the guidelines to provide that these sentences be consecutive in order to provide that the total punishment of these guidelines be complied as much as possible within the statutory maximums.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(emphasis added). Under the relevant \"grouping\" section of the Guidelines, &#167; 3D1.3(a), \"the offense level applicable to a Group is the offense level ... for the most serious of the counts comprising the Group.\" The district court's decision to focus on Count I, and only calculate an AOL and GSR for that count, is therefore consistent with the rules regarding grouping.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Hence, contrary to Manuel's position on appeal, the district court did not fail to \"group\" Counts I and II for sentencing.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> As far as we can tell, Manuel's grievance is with the court's decision to impose consecutive rather than concurrent sentences, apparently on the theory that grouping precludes consecutive sentences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 5G1.2(d) of the Guidelines provides that:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the sentence imposed on the count carrying the highest statutory maximum is less than the total punishment, then the sentence imposed on one or more of the other counts shall run consecutively, but only to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment.

(n.1) (\"The combined length of the sentences (`total punishment') is determined by the court after determining the adjusted combined offense level and the Criminal History Category.\"). Since Manuel's GSR was not truly a range, but rather \"life\" only, the sentencing court had no option but to fix Manuel's \"total punishment\" at life imprisonment. However, the two counts on which Manuel's conviction rested each had a statutory maximum sentence of only twenty years. The sentencing court indicated that it would therefore exercise its \"discretion\" under U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.2(d) and impose sentences on the two counts consecutively in order to get as close to a life term as possible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Like every other circuit that has considered the issue, we have previously stated that the language of &#167; 5G1.2(d) &#8212; indicating that sentences \"<i>shall</i> run consecutively\" (emphasis added) &#8212; is mandatory in order to achieve, to the greatest extent possible, a combined sentence \"equal to the total punishment.\" <i>United States v.

As explained persuasively in <i>Chase,</i> \"grouping and stacking are separate concepts relevant in different stages of the sentencing process.\" <i>Chase,</i> 296 F.3d. at 251. Grouping is one of the first steps undertaken during the sentencing process, and is done \"[i]n order to limit the significance of the formal charging decision and to prevent multiple punishment for substantially identical offense conduct,\" U.S.S.G. ch. 3, pt. D, intro. comment. In fact, the grouping of counts will often result in an appreciably lower offense level and correspondingly lower GSR than if the counts had not been grouped. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Sedoma,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200501\"><a href=\"/opinion/200501/united-states-v-sedoma/\"><span class=\"volume\">332</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">20</span></a></span>, 23-24 (1st Cir.2003).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After the sentencing court has determined the offense level (including all upward and downward adjustments) &#8212; whether for a group of counts, a combination of individual counts, or multiple groups &#8212; then, as explained above, the court fixes the \"total punishment\" within the applicable GSR. While grouping plays a critical role in these early stages of the sentencing calculus, once the court has fixed the \"total punishment\" somewhere within the GSR, the Guidelines provide no further role for grouping in the sentencing process. If one of the underlying counts of conviction has a statutory maximum sentence greater than or equal to the \"total punishment,\" the court will then impose the \"total punishment\" on that count, with sentences on any other counts running concurrently. <i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.2(d). If, however, none of the underlying counts of conviction have a statutory maximum sentence greater than or equal to the \"total punishment,\" the Guidelines mandate the imposition of consecutive sentences in order to achieve (as close as possible) the \"total punishment.\" <i>See id.</i> Hence, \"as a purely logical matter, there is no obstacle to stacking a defendant's sentences for grouped offenses.\" <i>Chase,</i> 296 F.3d at 251.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Other courts have repeatedly held that grouped counts may be \"stacked\" at sentencing. <i>See id.; see also Lott,</i> 310 F.3d at 1242 (indicating that sentencing court must apply &#167; 5G1.2(d) on grouped counts); <i>United States v.

Indeed, we have already indicated in dicta that the grouping of counts poses no bar to the imposition of consecutive sentences when necessary to achieve a combined sentence equivalent to the total punishment. <i>See United States v. Hernandez-Coplin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"670483\"><a href=\"/opinion/670483/united-states-v-ramon-hernandez-coplin/\"><span class=\"volume\">24</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">312</span></a></span>, 320 n. 9 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we agree with the <i>Chase</i> court that the stacking of grouped offenses furthers the policies underlying the Guidelines. The Guidelines were intended, in part, to create \"a system that imposes appropriately different sentences for criminal conduct of differing severity.\" U.S.S.G. ch. 1, pt. A(3). However, \"[i]f stacking for grouped offenses were prohibited, then two defendants guilty of multiple crimes might receive roughly the same sentence even though one was subject to a higher guideline range as a result of more harmful conduct or a more egregious criminal history.\" <i>Chase,</i> 296 F.3d at 253.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p67\">\n      <span class=\"num\">67</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the plain language of the Guidelines contemplates that consecutive sentences may be imposed on grouped counts; it has been the practice of other courts to do so; and such a practice furthers the policies underlying the Guidelines. We therefore conclude that the grouping of Counts I and II did not preclude the imposition of consecutive sentences on the grouped offenses, and we affirm Manuel's sentence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p68\">\n      <span class=\"num\">68</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for Andr&#233;s's sentencing hearing (which occurred immediately after Manuel's), the court followed the same approach. It alluded to the PSR's claim that the two counts should not be grouped, but, ultimately, the court did group them when it calculated the GSR by looking only to Count I. The court determined that the base offense level for Count I, as in Manuel's case, was 38. The court then made a two-level adjustment for weapons possession, and arrived at an AOL of 40. Cross-referencing to a CHC of III, the court arrived at a GSR of 360 months to life. The court determined that within that range, a total punishment of life was appropriate \"due to all the facts of this case[,] the defendant[']s participation, his disregard for life, for murders and all of the other incidents that this court saw throughout the three months of trial.\" Having thus fixed the total punishment at life, the district court was obligated under &#167; 5G1.2(d), as it was in Manuel's case, to impose a 20-year sentence (the statutory maximum) on each count, the sentences to run consecutively. We discern no error in the sentencing of Andr&#233;s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. The Money Laundering Count</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p69\">\n      <span class=\"num\">69</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Manuel and Andr&#233;s argue that the sentencing court erred when it sentenced them to the maximum term on the money laundering count \"without making any particularized findings of fact\" regarding the value of the funds laundered. As explained in the preceding section, however, the district court made no findings whatsoever on the money laundering count because the court grouped the two counts and calculated Manuel and Andr&#233;s's GSRs only according to its findings on the \"most serious\" count, i.e., the drug count. Once the court determined the total punishment for Manuel and Andr&#233;s, it was then obligated to sentence them to the statutory maximum on each count, and impose those sentences consecutively, in order to achieve a final sentence that most closely approximated that total punishment. Thus, if the district court had made particularized findings on the money laundering count, they would have had no effect on the ultimate sentence imposed. We therefore reject this assignment of error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. The \"Post-Sentence\" Report</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p70\">\n      <span class=\"num\">70</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellants Manuel<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and Bat&#237;z argue that the trial court erred when it sentenced them without the benefit of an updated PSR. Initial PSRs for Manuel and Bat&#237;z were prepared by the Probation Office on April 20, 1999. Because of various post-trial motions, including some based on <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">530</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">466</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118381\"><a href=\"/opinion/118381/apprendi-v-new-jersey/\"><span class=\"volume\">120</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

At their sentencing, they objected to a murder cross-reference on Count I, and, in the case of Manuel, certain findings regarding Count II. As indicated in Part IV.A, <i>supra,</i> however, the court ultimately did not apply a murder cross-reference on Count I, and with regard to Manuel's sentencing, the court made no findings on Count II since the court grouped that count with Count I. A month after the court had imposed its sentence, the probation office issued updated PSRs that no longer reflected the murder cross-reference. Manuel and Bat&#237;z claim that, as a result of the issuance of this \"Post-Sentence Report\" (as they call it), they are entitled to be resentenced.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p71\">\n      <span class=\"num\">71</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The version of Rule 32 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure in effect at the time of sentencing provided in pertinent part:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p72\">\n      <span class=\"num\">72</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The probation officer must make a presentence investigation and submit a report to the court before the sentence is imposed, unless:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p73\">\n      <span class=\"num\">73</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(A) the court finds that the information in the record enables it to exercise its sentencing authority meaningfully under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3553; and</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p74\">\n      <span class=\"num\">74</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">(B) the court explains this finding on the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p75\">\n      <span class=\"num\">75</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Fed.R.Crim.P. 32(b)(1) (2001).

The court was aware of the defendants' objections to those factual findings, and the court overruled them. As explained above, the court ignored the PSRs' cross-referencing of murder. The fact that a subsequent PSR, completed post-sentencing, reflected the court's decision, is simply irrelevant.

Counts involve substantially the same harm within the meaning of this rule:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">* * *</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(c) When one of the counts embodies conduct that is treated as a specific offense characteristic in, or other adjustment to, the guideline applicable to another of the counts.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">(d) When the offense level is determined largely on the basis of the total amount of harm or loss, the quantity of a substance involved, or some other measure of aggregate harm, or if the offense behavior is ongoing or continuous in nature and the offense guideline is written to cover such behavior.</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">[The following offenses] are to be grouped under this subsection:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Subsection (d) then goes on to identify the offenses which it covers. Drug conspiracy and money laundering are included in that list.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> The court did state that it was inclined to set the criminal history category of Manuel at III</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> Section 5G1.2 of the Guidelines is captioned \"Sentencing on Multiple Counts of Conviction\" and is discussed in more detail,<i>infra.</i></p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> The applicable guideline for the money laundering count provides that the offense level for that count is \"[t]he offense level for the underlying offense from which the laundered funds were derived,\" U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1(a)(1), that is to say, the same offense level as the drug conspiracy</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> Even if the sentencing court had not grouped the two counts, the combined offense level would have been the same as the offense level arrived at by the district court. The base offense level for money laundering is the same as that for the underlying criminal activity<i>See</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 2S1.1(a)(1). As a result, the combined offense level for the two ungrouped counts would have been the same as the offense level applicable to both crimes. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 3D1.4(a). Thus, even a decision not to group would have had no net effect.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> We realize that at the end of the hearing, when the court was orally imposing Manuel's sentence, the court appears to have read some of the text of the PSR when, according to the transcript, the court stated:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">Offense conduct comprising drug trafficking and money laundering are normally grouped together into a combined group as the offense conduct involves substantially the same arm [sic] within the meaning of guideline section 3D1.2(b) to wit the counts involve the same victim, society and 2 or more acts or transactions connected by a common criminal objective or constituting part of a common scheme or plan. However, as the offense conduct comprising count 1 not only involved generalized drug trafficking activities but also involved murder, the 2 counts of conviction are not groupable under the provisions of section 3D1.2. Immediately after making these comments, however, the court calculated Manuel's sentence by looking only to the most serious offense, i.e., Count I, a method of calculation appropriate only if the court was, in fact, grouping the two counts. <i>Compare</i> U.S.S.G. &#167; 3D1.3 (explaining how to determine offense level for grouped counts) <i>with id.</i> &#167; 3D1.4 (explaining how to determine combined offense level for ungrouped counts).</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> In<i>Saccoccia,</i> we explained the application of this mandatory requirement in these terms:</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\">When, as in this instance, the maximum sentence for each offense of conviction is lower than the minimum punishment mandated by the applicable GSR, the guidelines require imposition of consecutive sentences \"to the extent necessary to produce a combined sentence equal to the total punishment.\"</p>\n        <p class=\"indent\"><i>Saccoccia,</i> 58 F.3d at 786 (quoting U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.2(d)); <i>see also id.</i> at 787 (\"[T]he court below possessed the power &#8212; indeed, the responsibility &#8212; to impose a series of consecutive sentences effectuating the clearly expressed command of U.S.S.G. &#167; 5G1.2.\").
