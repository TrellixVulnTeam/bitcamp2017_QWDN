Walters, Assistant Director, were on brief,\nfor respondent.\n\n\n                        February 21, 2006\n\n\n\n* Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f          LYNCH, Circuit Judge.          The lead petitioner in this\n\nimmigration case is Luis Humberto Estrada-Canales (\"Estrada\"); the\n\nsix others are his children.     The case involves aspects of the ABC\n\nAgreement, concerning special procedures for certain Salvadorans\n\nand Guatemalans who enter the United States.           See Am. Baptist\n\nChurches v. Thornburgh, 760 F. Supp. 796 (N.D. Cal. 1991).            It\n\nraises one legal issue about interpretation of 8 U.S.C. § 1155\n\n(1994).\n\n          The petitioners are natives and citizens of Guatemala,\n\nwho entered the United States illegally.         The Immigration Judge\n\nordered them excluded and deported, deemed their applications for\n\nasylum and withholding of deportation abandoned, and determined\n\nthat they were ineligible for waivers of inadmissibility and\n\nsuspension of deportation. The Board of Immigration Appeals denied\n\npetitioners' appeal from that decision.         This is a petition for\n\nreview of that order of the BIA.\n\n          This case raises two sets of issues. One set arises over\n\nthe question of whether the petitioners are eligible for benefits\n\nunder the ABC Agreement.       The government denies this court has\n\njurisdiction   over   such    claims.      We   do   not   decide   those\n\njurisdictional issues.       Rather, we find petitioners have waived\n\ntheir claim by strategic decisions on their part.\n\n          As to the second set of issues, the usual petition for\n\nreview claims (pertaining to petitioners' excludability as charged\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fand   to   asylum),   the   respondent   agrees   that   this   court   has\n\njurisdiction.    We deny the petition for review.        In doing so, we\n\nalso uphold the interpretation by the BIA and the IJ of 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1155 (1994) that aliens who present themselves at a point of\n\nentry in the United States based on visa petitions fraudulently\n\nobtained in circumstances such as these are inadmissible and not\n\nentitled to entry.\n\n                                   I.\n\n            The basic facts of this case are not in dispute. Estrada\n\nfirst entered the United States without inspection in 1985.             On\n\nOctober 9, 1985, Estrada became an employee of P&B Manufacturing\n\n(\"P&B\") in Rhode Island; he worked as a jewelry polisher.         In 1989,\n\nP&B filed with the Department of Labor, on Estrada's behalf, an\n\nApplication for Alien Employment Certification.          Later, P&B also\n\nfiled with the INS1 a Petition for Prospective Immigrant Employee\n\n(Form I-140).    This petition was approved on April 26, 1993.          By\n\nthen, in fact since August 9, 1991, Estrada had been laid off, but\n\nhe did not notify the INS.      After being laid off, Estrada did not\n\nwork at P&B other than as a subcontractor.\n\n\n\n\n      1\n       On March 1, 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred to the Department of Homeland Security, and the INS\nsubsequently ceased to exist. See Homeland Security Act of 2002,\nPub. L. No. 107-296, § 471(a), 116 Stat. 2135, 2205 (codified at 6\nU.S.C. § 291(a)).   For the sake of simplicity, we use the term\n\"INS\" throughout the opinion.\n\n                                   -3-\n\f                Meanwhile, in July 1991, Estrada filed a form with the\n\nINS in order to register as a class member under the ABC Agreement.\n\nThe ABC Agreement is a class action settlement agreement that was\n\napproved in American Baptist Churches, 760 F. Supp. 796.                    \"The ABC\n\nlitigation arose out of systemic challenges by certain Salvadorans\n\nand Guatemalans in the United States to the processing of asylum\n\nclaims filed under . . . 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a).\"               Matter of Morales,\n\n21    I.    &   N.   Dec.   130,   132    (BIA   1996).     The    ABC   agreement\n\n\"contemplates a special procedure under which alien class members\n\nare    entitled,       under   certain      specified     conditions,       to    new\n\nproceedings before the [INS] to determine their right to asylum or\n\nany other rights and benefits established under the agreement.\"\n\nId.        The ABC Agreement provides that during those special new\n\nproceedings,         the    pending      case    before   the     IJ   is    to   be\n\nadministratively closed.           Id. at 134.\n\n                In March 1992, Estrada applied for asylum, listing his\n\nchildren on the application.2\n\n                In June 1995, Estrada went to Guatemala.               He says his\n\ntrip \"was taken solely to bring his children\" back to the United\n\nStates, and that claim does not seem to be in dispute.                      Estrada\n\nwent to the United States Consulate in Guatemala City to obtain his\n\nimmigrant visa.        There, he presented a forged letter, purportedly\n\n\n       2\n       The asylum application lists only five children (Brenda,\nBeatriz, Lazaro, Luis, and Kimberly), omitting Silvia.        The\nexclusion proceedings involved all six of Estrada's children.\n\n                                          -4-\n\ffrom P&B, indicating that he continued to be employed full-time by\n\nP&B.        Of course, Estrada had not been so employed since 1991.\n\nUnaware of the fraud, the consulate issued the visa on September\n\n12, 1995, on the basis of an approved labor certification. Estrada\n\nand his children then attempted to enter the United States on\n\nOctober      1,    1995,       but   the    INS   detained    them   because     the    INS\n\ninspector could not find an approved labor certification among the\n\ndocuments.         The INS paroled Estrada and his children into the\n\nUnited       States      for    deferred     inspection       by   the   INS   office    in\n\nProvidence, Rhode Island.\n\n                 On October 24, 1995, an immigration inspector sent a\n\nletter      to    P&B,    requesting,        inter    alia,    information     regarding\n\nEstrada's employment.                A representative of P&B replied with a\n\nletter      stating      that    the   letter       Estrada    had   presented    to    the\n\nconsulate was a forgery, and that Estrada had not been employed by\n\nP&B since 1991.          On November 8, 1995, P&B withdrew the Petition for\n\nProspective Immigrant Employee (Form I-140) that it had previously\n\nfiled on Estrada's behalf.                 A week later, on November 15, 1995, the\n\nINS placed the Estradas in exclusion proceedings.3\n\n                 There was an initial hearing before an IJ on October 1,\n\n1996.       The INS alleged that the Estradas were excludable on two\n\ngrounds: first, they lacked a valid labor certification, see 8\n\n\n        3\n       Estrada was the lead applicant for relief. The IJ and the\nBIA, as well as the parties, have treated the claims of Estrada and\nhis children collectively, focusing primarily on Estrada himself.\n\n                                              -5-\n\fU.S.C. § 1182(a)(5)(A)(i); and second, they were immigrants without\n\nvalid unexpired immigrant visas, see id. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I).\n\nThe Estradas denied that they were excludable as charged, and they\n\nindicated that they sought the opportunity to apply for admission\n\nas lawful permanent residents, termination of the proceedings,\n\nasylum, withholding of deportation, suspension of deportation, and\n\nwaivers   of    excludability       under    §       212(d)(3)    and    (k)   of   the\n\nImmigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. § 1182(d)(3), (k).\n\n           At a hearing on January 7, 1997, before a second IJ, the\n\nparties agreed to stipulate to the historical facts just described.\n\nThe IJ noted that in addition to the question of excludability on\n\nthe   grounds    charged,    there     was       a    question    of     whether    the\n\nproceedings should be administratively closed pursuant to the ABC\n\nAgreement, as the Estradas had requested.                        The IJ reset the\n\nproceedings     on   the   latter   question,         and   on   other    issues    not\n\npertinent here, for a later date.\n\n           On February 4, 1997, an INS asylum office director sent\n\na letter to Estrada.       The letter stated:\n\n                Information submitted to this office by\n           INS Litigation Unit, Boston reflects that you\n           attempted to enter the United States at Miami\n           International Airport on October 1, 1995,\n           without valid immigration documents.\n                The Settlement Agreement in American\n           Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh, 760 F. Supp.\n           796 (N.D. Cal. 1991) (ABC), provides that\n           class members apprehended at the time of entry\n           after December 19, 1990, shall not be eligible\n           for its benefits.    See Paragraph 2 of the\n           Settlement Agreement.     Based on the above\n\n                                       -6-\n\f                 facts,   it  is   determined  that            you    are\n                 ineligible   for   benefits  under            the    ABC\n                 Settlement Agreement.\n\nThat       is,   the   INS'   position   was    that   while    Estrada     may   have\n\noriginally been within the ABC class, he was not \"eligible for its\n\nbenefits.\"\n\n                 On March 4, 1997, Estrada brought an action in the\n\nDistrict Court for Rhode Island.               He sought a declaration that he\n\nwas entitled to ABC benefits, and he sought an injunction against\n\ncontinuation of the regular exclusion proceedings until his rights\n\nunder the agreement were honored.\n\n                 On September 2, 1997, the IJ issued a written decision\n\nresolving several of the issues in the case.                         She held that\n\nexclusion proceedings were appropriate and that the Estradas were\n\nexcludable as charged; in so holding, she rejected the Estradas'\n\nargument that, because they had already begun their journey to the\n\nUnited States when the visa petition was withdrawn, they had valid\n\nvisas, they were entitled to enter the United States, and they were\n\nentitled to lawful permanent resident status.                   The IJ also held\n\nthat the family was not entitled to administrative closure of the\n\ncase before her under the ABC Agreement so that a special ABC\n\nAgreement hearing could be held.4\n\n\n       4\n       The IJ also held that pursuant to § 244 of the INA, 8 U.S.C.\n§ 1254 (1994) (repealed 1996), the Estradas were statutorily\nineligible for suspension of deportation, a ruling she reiterated\nin later proceedings. Also in later proceedings, the IJ found that\nwaivers of inadmissibility under INA § 212(d)(3) and (k) did not\n\n                                         -7-\n\f          The IJ held that the Estradas were properly in exclusion\n\nproceedings because \"[o]nce the [INS] determined that the validity\n\nof [Estrada's] underlying labor certification was at issue, it had\n\nthe right to deny [the Estradas] entrance to the United States and\n\nplace [them] in exclusion proceedings.\"               P&B did not withdraw the\n\npetition it had earlier filed on Estrada's behalf until after\n\nEstrada had already commenced his journey to the United States, and\n\ntherefore,    the    IJ    reasoned,    the    withdrawal     did     not    serve   to\n\nautomatically revoke Estrada's employment-based visa. See 8 C.F.R.\n\n§ 205.1(3).     Nonetheless, the IJ found that the withdrawal by the\n\nemployer was still \"significant.\"             The mere fact that there was no\n\nautomatic revocation did not mean that the Estradas' visas were in\n\nfact valid and that the family was in fact entitled to seek lawful\n\npermanent resident status.             The IJ noted that under former INA\n\n§ 221(h), 8 U.S.C. § 1201(h) (1994), nothing in the Immigration and\n\nNationality Act entitled an alien, even one who had an approved\n\nvisa at the time he commenced his journey, to enter the United\n\nStates, if upon arrival, he is found inadmissible.\n\n          The       IJ    sustained    the    two   charges    of    excludability.\n\nFirst, the IJ analyzed the validity of Estrada's visa, taking into\n\naccount   the       underlying    visa        petition   and        the     employment\n\n\napply. The BIA affirmed the IJ's decisions on these points. In\ntheir petition for review of the BIA's decision, the Estradas do\nnot   discuss   suspension   of   deportation   or   waivers   of\ninadmissibility, so they have waived any argument they might have\nmade as to these forms of relief.\n\n                                        -8-\n\frelationship on which it depended.              The IJ noted that the visa was\n\nbased on an approved labor certification purportedly filed by P&B,\n\nand   that    as    part    of   that   process,      Estrada    submitted    to   the\n\nconsulate a forged letter stating that he was a full-time employee\n\nof P&B.      The IJ also noted that P&B's representative had, in fact,\n\nrefused to write for Estrada a letter stating that Estrada was\n\nstill employed by P&B, and had instead written a letter explaining\n\nthat Estrada had been laid off on August 9, 1991, and the IJ found\n\nthat \"[i]f such a letter had been submitted in support of the labor\n\ncertification and the employment-based visa, . . . neither would\n\nhave been granted.\"           The IJ concluded that P&B was unwilling to\n\nserve as petitioner on Estrada's behalf, that Estrada \"was not\n\nentitled to the status accorded to him by the visa petition,\" and\n\nthat \"the labor certification was improvidently issued.\"                      The IJ\n\nheld that \"the visa issued to [the Estradas] was invalid and . . .\n\n[they are] excludable\" as charged.\n\n              As for administrative closure under the ABC Agreement,\n\nthe IJ noted that neither she nor the BIA had jurisdiction to\n\nreview    the      INS'    determination   of    an    alien's    eligibility      for\n\nbenefits under the ABC agreement.                  Here, the INS had already\n\ndetermined that the Estradas were not entitled to benefits under\n\nthe agreement, as shown in the February 4, 1997 letter.                      In light\n\nof that determination, the IJ concluded that administrative closure\n\nwas not appropriate.             The IJ noted that, aside from the ABC\n\n\n                                         -9-\n\fagreement, the Estradas could still pursue applications for asylum\n\nand withholding of deportation before the Immigration Court.\n\n             The IJ's September 2, 1997 decision concluded with two\n\norders: (1) the charges of excludability were sustained, and (2)\n\nthe motion to administratively close the proceedings was denied.\n\n             The exclusion proceedings resumed on September 25, 1997.\n\nDuring that proceeding, the IJ orally incorporated her September 2\n\nwritten decision.    She gave the Estradas until January 12, 1998 to\n\neither apply for asylum or advise the Immigration Court that they\n\nwere not seeking such relief.\n\n             The final proceedings before the IJ occurred on January\n\n22, 1998.5     Counsel for the Estradas informed the IJ that the\n\nEstradas were not going to file applications for asylum because\n\nthey felt that to do so \"would be giving up procedural due process\n\nrights that they have to an administrative political asylum hearing\n\nas they are registered ABC class members.\"      The IJ concluded the\n\nJanuary 22 proceedings by issuing oral rulings resolving the\n\nremaining issues in the case: she incorporated her prior written\n\ndecision of September 2 and her oral decision of September 25; she\n\ndeemed the Estradas' applications for asylum and withholding of\n\n\n     5\n        On January 9, 1998, the Estradas requested a continuance,\nin part because the Rhode Island district court had not yet decided\nEstrada's case, and \"should [it] decide [the issue of eligibility\nfor benefits under the ABC Agreement] in favor of [Estrada] then\nExclusion Proceedings should be administratively closed.\"       The\ngovernment opposed the continuance, and the IJ denied the\ncontinuance on January 14, 1998.\n\n                                 -10-\n\fdeportation abandoned; and she ordered the Estradas excluded as\n\ncharged and deported.        That same day, the IJ's final oral decision\n\nwas also embodied in written form.6\n\n             The Estradas appealed the IJ's orders to the BIA.                   They\n\nargued that they were not excludable because the visa petition was\n\nwithdrawn     after   they     arrived    in     the    United   States,   and    the\n\nwithdrawal was consequently not valid and did not work a revocation\n\nof the visa petition underlying their visas.                   \"[I]t follows [that\n\nthe Estradas] have valid visa petitions and they should therefore\n\nbe admitted as . . . lawful permanent residents.\"\n\n             The Estradas also argued that Estrada was a registered\n\nABC class member who was entitled to administrative closure of the\n\nproceedings before the IJ in favor of the ABC Agreement special\n\nproceedings.       Citing Matter of Morales, 21 I. & N. Dec. 130, they\n\nargued      that   Estrada's     departure       from    the     country   and    his\n\napprehension upon reentry did not divest him of his rights under\n\nthe   ABC     Agreement.        They     added    that     the    asylum   office's\n\ndetermination of Estrada's ineligibility for ABC benefits had been\n\nmade without a hearing or other \"due process safeguards.\"                         The\n\nEstradas mentioned the ABC-related action they had brought in the\n\nfederal district court, but they stated that that court had not yet\n\n\n\n      6\n       On January 22, 1998, the IJ issued for each petitioner a\nwritten order summarizing her final oral decision. Each written\norder stated that the IJ's final oral decision was the official\nopinion in the case.\n\n                                         -11-\n\fdecided the matter.        The Estradas' brief on appeal to the BIA was\n\ndated August 31, 1998.\n\n            The Estradas also argued that the IJ erred in deeming\n\ntheir   applications    for    asylum     and       withholding        of   deportation\n\nabandoned,    because   being    forced       to    apply     for    such     relief    in\n\nexclusion proceedings would have violated their rights under the\n\nABC Agreement.\n\n            On   September     16,    1999,     during      the     pendency      of   the\n\nEstradas' appeal to the BIA, the district court decided the case\n\nEstrada had earlier filed.            The government had moved to dismiss\n\nEstrada's    claim   for     injunctive       relief    and    moved        for   summary\n\njudgment on Estrada's claim for declaratory relief.                           The court\n\ngranted   the    government's        motion    to    dismiss        with    respect     to\n\nEstrada's claim for injunctive relief, finding that 8 U.S.C.\n\n§ 1252(g) had divested the court of jurisdiction to enjoin the\n\nexclusion proceeding.          The government conceded the court had\n\njurisdiction over the declaratory judgment part of the case.                           The\n\ncourt, however, noted that it had discretion whether to issue a\n\ndeclaratory      judgment.      The     court       declined      to    exercise       its\n\njurisdiction, noting that \"adjudicating Estrada's claim for a\n\ndeclaratory judgment . . . would result in parallel litigation in\n\nwhich issues arising from a single dispute would be litigated in\n\ndifferent fora, thereby resulting in duplication of effort and\n\neither piecemeal litigation or the possibility of inconsistent\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fresults or both.\"    The court denied the government's motion for\n\nsummary judgment with respect to Estrada's claim for declaratory\n\nrelief, and it gave Estrada twenty days to show cause as to why his\n\nclaim for declaratory judgment should not be dismissed without\n\nprejudice.   On October 14, 1999, the court dismissed Estrada's\n\ncomplaint without prejudice, stating that he had failed to show\n\ncause.   Estrada had not filed anything in the district court after\n\nthe September 16 order, nor did he file anything after October 14,\n\n1999.\n\n           Nothing in the certified administrative record indicates\n\nthat the Estradas ever brought the district court's decision to the\n\nattention of the BIA, even though their appeal was still pending\n\nbefore the BIA.\n\n           On April 15, 2003, the BIA dismissed the Estradas' appeal\n\nfrom the IJ's decision.      The BIA agreed with the IJ on the\n\nappropriateness of exclusion proceedings and on excludability as\n\ncharged, for essentially the same reasons as those cited by the IJ.\n\nThe BIA stated that administrative closure under the ABC Agreement\n\nwould not have been appropriate, because the INS had already made\n\na determination that Estrada had no right to benefits under the\n\nagreement.   The BIA did not mention Estrada's suit in the district\n\ncourt, which had been brought to the BIA's attention, or the\n\ndistrict court's ultimate decision, which had not.     Finally, the\n\nBIA noted that the IJ gave Estrada numerous opportunities to apply\n\n\n                                -13-\n\ffor asylum and withholding, but he refused to apply, and held that\n\nthe IJ did not err in determining that those applications were\n\nabandoned.   This petition for review followed.\n\n          The issues are whether, in light of the standards of\n\nreview, the BIA erred in refusing to allow administrative closure\n\nof the exclusion proceedings, whether it erred in determining that\n\nthe Estradas were excludable as charged, and whether it erred in\n\ndeeming the asylum applications abandoned.       We deny the petition.\n\n                                 II.\n\nA.        Standard of Review\n\n          A deferential standard of review applies in this case.\n\n\"[A] decision that an alien is not eligible for admission to the\n\nUnited States is conclusive unless manifestly contrary to law.\"       8\n\nU.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(C).    Moreover, the BIA's \"interpretations of\n\nthe   statutes   and   regulations     it   administers   are   accorded\n\nsubstantial deference\"; where a statute is \"silent or ambiguous,\"\n\nwe uphold the BIA's interpretation, so long as it is \"'reasonable'\n\nand consistent with the statute.\" Elien v. Ashcroft, 364 F.3d 392,\n\n396-97 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n          Finally, in a petition for review of a final order of\n\nremoval, the \"administrative findings of fact are conclusive unless\n\nany reasonable adjudicator would be compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary.\"   8 U.S.C. § 1252(b)(4)(B).      This standard of review as\n\nto factual questions is commonly known as the \"substantial evidence\n\n\n                                -14-\n\ftest,\" and substantial evidence exists where the decision is\n\n\"supported by reasonable, substantial, and probative evidence on\n\nthe record considered as a whole.\"                 Katebi v. Ashcroft, 396 F.3d\n\n463,       466   (1st    Cir.   2005)     (internal   quotation     marks    omitted)\n\n(quoting INS v. Elias-Zacarias, 502 U.S. 478, 481 (1992)).7\n\nB.               Administrative Closure under the ABC Agreement\n\n                 The    Estradas'   first    challenge   to   the    exclusion    and\n\ndeportation order is that the exclusion proceedings should not even\n\nhave been allowed to continue: they say that they were eligible ABC\n\nclass       members      entitled    to     administrative    closure       of   their\n\nimmigration proceedings, and that the proceedings should only have\n\nbeen reopened once it was determined at a \"hearing conducted in\n\naccordance with the mandates of the ABC agreement\" that they were\n\nnot entitled to ABC benefits.\n\n                 Under Paragraph 1 of the ABC Agreement, the settlement\n\nclass includes only \"all Salvadorans in the United States as of\n\nSeptember 19, 1990,\" and \"all Guatemalans in the United States as\n\n\n\n       7\n       The REAL ID Act of 2005, Pub. L. No. 109-13, 119 Stat. 231,\n302-23, does not affect our analysis of the issues in this petition\nfor review.    At oral argument, the government agreed that in\ngeneral, district courts can review the question of entitlement to\nbenefits under the ABC Agreement, and that this was unchanged by\nthe REAL ID Act.    The government argues that in the particular\ncontext of this case, transfer of the ABC issue to the district\ncourt would be improper, because under 8 U.S.C. § 1252, as amended\nby the REAL ID Act of 2005, district courts lack jurisdiction over\npetitions for review.      We do not reach this jurisdictional\nquestion, and the REAL ID Act does not affect any other issues in\nthis case.\n\n                                            -15-\n\fof October 1, 1990.\"      Am. Baptist Churches, 760 F. Supp. at 799.\n\nParagraph 2 states which class members are eligible for a \"de novo,\n\nunappealable    asylum    adjudication       before      an   Asylum    Officer,\n\nincluding a new interview.\"     Id.    First, the class member must not\n\nhave been convicted of an aggravated felony as defined in the INA.\n\nId.    Second, for Guatemalans, the class members must \"indicate to\n\nthe INS in writing their intent to apply for a de novo asylum\n\nadjudication before an Asylum Officer, or otherwise to receive the\n\nbenefits of this agreement, within the period of time commencing\n\nJuly 1, 1991 and ending on December 31, 1991.\"                    Id. at 800.\n\nFinally, \"[c]lass members apprehended at time of entry after the\n\ndate   of   preliminary   approval    of    this   agreement    shall    not   be\n\neligible for the benefits hereunder.\"              Id.    The district court\n\nprovisionally approved the agreement on December 19, 1990.                Id. at\n\n797.\n\n            Paragraph 17 of the Agreement states that \"[t]he INS may\n\nonly detain class members, eligible for relief under paragraph 2,\n\nwho are otherwise subject to detention under current law and who:\n\n(1) have been convicted of a crime involving moral turpitude for\n\nwhich the sentence actually imposed exceeded a term of imprisonment\n\nin excess of six months; or (2) pose a national security risk; or\n\n(3) pose a threat to public safety.\"          Id. at 804.\n\n            Paragraph 19 provides for administrative closure pending\n\nthe new asylum adjudication.     It states, in pertinent part:\n\n\n                                     -16-\n\f           [A]ny   class    member    whose   deportation\n           proceeding . . . was commenced after November\n           30, 1990 . . . may ask the Immigration Court\n           or the BIA to administratively close his or\n           her case and the case will be administratively\n           closed unless the class member has been\n           convicted of an aggravated felony or is\n           subject to detention under paragraph 17.\n\nId. at 805.     Under Paragraph 20, \"[i]f the asylum application is\n\nfinally denied under the procedures set forth in this agreement,\"\n\na case pending before an IJ shall, upon notice from the INS, be\n\nrecalendared.    Id. at 806.\n\n           Under Paragraph 35,\n\n           [i]f an individual class member who has sought\n           the benefits or rights of this agreement\n           raises any claim regarding the denial of any\n           such right or benefit (including a dispute\n           over membership in the class) . . . , such\n           individual is entitled to seek enforcement of\n           the provisions hereof by initiating a separate\n           proceeding in any federal district court, and\n           the   Defendants   will    not   contest   the\n           jurisdiction of such court to hear any such\n           claim . . . .\n\nId. at 809-10.\n\n           The crux of the Estradas' complaint is that they were not\n\nafforded a hearing before an asylum officer or otherwise given a\n\nchance to make their case for continued eligibility for benefits\n\nunder the ABC Agreement.           They say they were deprived of due\n\nprocess, because the INS reached the determination in its letter of\n\nFebruary   4,    1997,   without    giving     the   family   notice   or   an\n\nopportunity to present evidence.            Because the INS' determination\n\nthat Estrada was not entitled to ABC benefits was procedurally\n\n                                     -17-\n\funsound, it amounted, the Estradas say, to \"nothing\" -- essentially\n\nno determination at all -- and the IJ and BIA erred in refusing to\n\nallow administrative closure.\n\n            The   Estradas   stress    that    none   of   the   Paragraph   17\n\ndisqualifiers apply.         Their case for eligibility is that the\n\n\"apprehended at time of entry after\" December 19, 1990 provision\n\ndoes not apply to them: once Estrada registered and filed an asylum\n\nrequest which listed his children, they say, their \"rights under\n\nthe ABC agreement were vested.\"        In the Estradas' view, once their\n\nrights vested, nothing in the ABC Agreement provides for the loss\n\nof their rights simply because Estrada departed and the family\n\nsubsequently came to the United States.\n\n            The government responds that the INS determined that\n\nEstrada was ineligible for ABC benefits, that this determination\n\nwas not reviewable by the IJ or by the BIA, see Matter of Morales,\n\n21 I. & N. Dec. at 134-35, and that this court has no jurisdiction\n\nto consider any of the Estradas' ABC-related challenges.8\n\n            The   government   says    the    ABC   Agreement    \"specifically\n\nprovides for determination of [eligibility for ABC benefits] in a\n\ndistrict court, not pursuant to a petition for review in a court of\n\nappeals.\"    In the government's view, jurisdiction once existed in\n\n\n\n     8\n       The government argues in the alternative that if we have\njurisdiction over the issue of the Estradas' eligibility for ABC\nbenefits, we should find the Estradas ineligible, because they were\n\"apprehended at time of entry\" after the cut-off date.\n\n                                      -18-\n\fthe district court, but Estrada squandered his chance there by\n\nfailing to respond to the show-cause order and/or to appeal the\n\ndistrict court's decision.        The government also stresses that the\n\nEstradas never advised the BIA of the district court's decision,\n\nand that they never moved to reopen while the case was pending.\n\nThe government says that in the posture of this case -- a petition\n\nfor review of the BIA's decision, and not an appeal from the\n\ndistrict court -- this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the\n\nEstradas' eligibility for ABC benefits.\n\n              At oral argument, this court raised the possibility of\n\ntransferring the present ABC issue to the District Court for the\n\nDistrict of Rhode Island.        The government opposes such a transfer\n\non two grounds.      First, it says, the petition for review of the BIA\n\ndecision could not have been brought in the district court in the\n\nfirst instance, so transfer is improper under 28 U.S.C. § 1631,\n\nwhich states:\n\n              Whenever a civil action is filed in a court\n              . . . or an appeal, including a petition for\n              review of administrative action, is noticed\n              for or filed with . . . a court and that court\n              finds that there is a want of jurisdiction,\n              the court shall, if it is in the interest of\n              justice, transfer such action or appeal to any\n              other such court in which the action or appeal\n              could have been brought at the time it was\n              filed or noticed . . . .\n\n28   U.S.C.    §   1631   (emphasis   added).   The   government's   second\n\nargument is that it is not \"in the interest of justice\" to transfer\n\nthis issue to the district court, because Estrada failed to respond\n\n                                      -19-\n\fto the show-cause order, did not appeal the district court's\n\ndecision, and did not even advise the BIA of the district court's\n\ndecision.   The Estradas counter that jurisdiction in the district\n\ncourt would be proper, and that transfer would be in the interest\n\nof justice; they say they \"have raised and preserved the ABC issue\n\nthroughout the course of the litigation.\"\n\n            We do not delve into the merits of the government's\n\nvarious jurisdictional challenges on the ABC issues.   Instead, we\n\nrest on the ground that, on these facts, the petitioners have\n\nwaived consideration of the ABC issue by this court or by the\n\ndistrict court (even assuming a transfer).\n\n            Estrada never showed cause to the district court as to\n\nwhy his case based on a claim for ABC benefits should not be\n\ndismissed, and he never appealed the decision of the district\n\ncourt.   The Estradas argued before the BIA that they were entitled\n\nto administrative closure under the ABC Agreement, noted that they\n\nhad not received a hearing before an asylum officer on the matter,\n\nand alerted the BIA to the fact that Estrada had filed a case in\n\nthe district court.   But they never told the BIA how that case was\n\ndecided or that the district court could have been viewed as\n\ndeferring the ABC issue back to the agency.        They had ample\n\nopportunity to do so.\n\n            The district court issued its memorandum and show-cause\n\norder on September 16, 1999, and it dismissed Estrada's complaint\n\n\n                                -20-\n\ffor failure to show cause on October 14, 1999, but the BIA did not\n\ndecide the Estradas' appeal from the IJ's decision until April 15,\n\n2003.   The BIA did not address the proper response to the district\n\ncourt's decision because it was not asked to.              Cf. Xu v. Gonzales,\n\n424 F.3d 45, 48-49 (1st Cir. 2005) (where point was not argued in\n\nappeal from IJ's decision, BIA was under no obligation to address\n\npoint, and issue was waived and would not be considered by this\n\ncourt).      Rather,      the   Estradas    chose   to    cause   delay,    which\n\nbenefitted   them    by    keeping   them    in   the    United   States.    The\n\ndismissal of Estrada's action in the district court was more than\n\nsix years ago.      Estrada is not entitled to reopen it now.               Taken\n\ntogether, the various omissions amount to waiver, and we will\n\nneither consider the ABC issue nor transfer it to the district\n\ncourt for further proceedings.\n\nC.         Conventional Petition for Review Claims\n\n           1.       Excludability as Charged\n\n           The Estradas' second line of attack goes to the IJ/BIA\n\ndetermination that they were in fact excludable as charged: they\n\nsay that Estrada was not attempting a new entry and that the\n\ngovernment did not properly revoke their immigrant visas before\n\nthey commenced their journey to the United States.                This presents\n\nthe mixed standard of review: the factual determinations are\n\nreviewed under the substantial evidence test, see Ang v. Gonzales,\n\n\n\n\n                                     -21-\n\f430 F.3d 50, 54-55 (1st Cir. 2005); the BIA's interpretations of\n\nlaw are reviewed with deference, see Elien, 364 F.3d at 396-97.\n\n           a.     New Entry\n\n           As to the \"new entry\" issue, the Estradas say that once\n\nEstrada was \"accorded protected registered class status under the\n\nABC agreement after his initial entry in 1985, he kept that status\n\nintact when entering the United States subsequent to the ABC\n\nagreement preliminary approval date of December 19, 1990.\"      The\n\nEstradas say that in light of Estrada's status as a registered ABC\n\nclass member, his \"first and only entry\" was in October 1985, his\n\n1995 arrival should not have been deemed a new entry, and the\n\nchildren's status is the same.    They say their situation involved\n\nmerely an \"innocent, casual, and brief\" departure.     Rosenberg v.\n\nFleuti, 374 U.S. 449, 462 (1963).       Whatever the merits of this\n\nargument, the government points out that it was not raised before\n\nthe BIA.   Although the Estradas clearly invoked the ABC Agreement\n\nbefore the BIA, they did so only as to administrative closure, and\n\nthey did not articulate an \"innocent, casual, and brief\" argument\n\nbefore the BIA.   The argument is therefore waived.     See Chen v.\n\nGonzales, 415 F.3d 151, 154 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n           b.     Timing of Withdrawal of Visa Petition\n\n           The Estradas also argue that because their visas were not\n\nrevoked prior to the commencement of their journey to the United\n\nStates, they should have been allowed entry, and the BIA erred in\n\n\n                                 -22-\n\fholding them excludable as charged.9            They say that once the\n\ngovernment discovered that the letter presented to the consulate\n\nwas a forgery, the appropriate response was to put the family in\n\ndeportation proceedings; they also say this would have made them\n\neligible   for    relief    that   was    not   available   in    exclusion\n\nproceedings.\n\n           i.      Appropriateness of Exclusion Proceedings\n\n           The Estradas base their argument on former INA § 205,\n\nwhich,   before   the   Illegal    Immigration    Reform    and   Immigrant\n\nResponsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No. 104-208, Div. C,\n\n110 Stat. 3009, 3009-546 (1996), provided that revocation of the\n\napproval of any visa petition will not have effect unless there is\n\nnotice prior to the petition beneficiary's commencement of travel\n\nto the United States.      See 8 U.S.C. § 1155 (1994).      Their argument\n\nis that the fact that withdrawal of the visa petition occurred\n\nafter their journey had commenced (and indeed, not until well after\n\nthey had been paroled into the United States) means that the\n\nwithdrawal was not valid and did not result in revocation of the\n\n\n\n\n     9\n       The Estradas' argument on excludability is based on the\nstatutory scheme in effect before the Illegal Immigration Reform\nand Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub. L. No.\n104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-546 (1996). We use the pre-\nIIRIRA versions of the statutes. See id. § 309(c)(1), 110 Stat. at\n3009-625, amended by Act of Oct. 11, 1997, § 2, Pub. L. No.\n104-302, 110 Stat. 3656, 3657; Goncalves v. Reno, 144 F.3d 110, 116\n(1st Cir. 1998).\n\n                                   -23-\n\fapproval of their visa petition, and that they should have been put\n\ninto deportation proceedings.\n\n            The     Estradas'     conclusion       is   contrary       to   the    BIA's\n\nreasonable   interpretation        of   the    statutory       text.10       The    last\n\nsentence of § 1155 then provided that \"[i]f notice of revocation is\n\nnot so given, and the beneficiary applies for admission to the\n\nUnited States, his admissibility shall be determined in the manner\n\nprovided for by sections 1225 and 1226 of this title.\"                       Id.       The\n\npre-IIRIRA versions of §§ 1225 and 1226 dealt with exclusion, not\n\ndeportation, procedures.          See 8 U.S.C. §§ 1225, 1226 (1994).                   It\n\nwas reasonable for the BIA to conclude that the only consequence of\n\nfailure to notify before travel was that the right to admission\n\nwould be adjudicated in exclusion proceedings.\n\n            Furthermore, INA § 221(h) provided at the time that\n\n\"[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to entitle any alien,\n\nto whom a visa or other documentation has been issued, to enter the\n\nUnited    States,    if,   upon    arrival     .    .   .    he   is    found     to   be\n\ninadmissible.\"      8 U.S.C. § 1201(h) (1994).              The IJ found that this\n\n\n     10\n       Both the BIA and the IJ cited the BIA's decision in Matter\nof Alarcon, 17 I. &. N. Dec. 574 (BIA 1980). In that case, an\nalien was held to be excludable at entry where she entered the\nUnited States with an immigrant visa \"accorded to her as the\nunmarried daughter of a lawful permanent resident,\" although in\nfact she had been married before she entered the United States.\nId. at 575. The BIA, interpreting § 1155, dismissed her appeal.\nThe BIA stated that \"if revocation was not effective and the\nbeneficiary applies for admission, his admissibility is to be\ndetermined in exclusion proceedings,\" id. at 576, and that\n\"excludability was appropriately charged,\" id. at 577.\n\n                                        -24-\n\fis what happened here, and quoted this exact language.                   The BIA\n\nagreed with the IJ.           We see no reason for overturning the BIA's\n\ndecision that exclusion proceedings were proper.\n\n                ii.     Grounds of Excludability\n\n                The BIA's ultimate determination that the Estradas were\n\nexcludable was, far from being \"manifestly contrary to law,\" based\n\non reasonable statutory interpretations and ample factual support.\n\nThe      charged        grounds    of     excludability     were     8    U.S.C.\n\n§ 1182(a)(5)(A)(i)11 and (a)(7)(A)(i)(I).12                The BIA reasonably\n\ninterpreted § 1155 and concluded that nothing about the timing of\n\nP&B's withdrawal of the petition rendered the Estradas' labor\n\ncertifications or immigrant visas automatically valid.                   The BIA\n\ncited its decision in Matter of Alarcon, 17 I. &. N. Dec. 574,\n\nwhich        rejected   the   argument   that   \"since   [the   alien]   was   not\n\nnotified that her visa petition was revoked before she came to this\n\ncountry, her visa petition and, therefore, her visa were still\n\nvalid.\"         Id. at 575.       Instead, the BIA said, the IJ should\n\n\n        11\n       This section then provided that \"[a]ny alien who seeks to\nenter the United States for the purpose of performing skilled or\nunskilled labor is excludable,\" absent a labor certification. 8\nU.S.C. § 1182(a)(5)(A)(i) (1994).\n        12\n        This section then provided that, \"[e]xcept as otherwise\nspecifically provided in this chapter,\" an immigrant who at the\ntime of application for admission \"is not in possession of a valid\nunexpired immigrant visa . . . or other valid entry document\nrequired by this chapter, and a valid unexpired passport, or other\nsuitable travel document, or document of identity and nationality\nif such document is required [under certain regulations],\" is\nexcludable. 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I) (1994).\n\n                                         -25-\n\f\"examine[]     the   applicant's   visa   to   determine    its   validity,\"\n\nreaching   a   decision   \"inherently     involv[ing]      scrutiny   of   the\n\nunderlying visa petition and the relationship on which it depends.\"\n\nId. at 576.     \"If [the IJ] determines that a flaw exists in that\n\nrelationship such that the alien was not actually entitled to the\n\nstatus which was accorded to him by the visa petition, the [IJ] may\n\nconclude that the visa is invalid.\"        Id.   This can hardly be said\n\nto be an unreasonable interpretation of the immigration statutes.\n\n           The Estradas fare no better with respect to the BIA's\n\nfactual findings and application of law to facts.            The BIA agreed\n\nwith the IJ that the visas, visa petition, and labor certification\n\nwere based on fraudulent information and were invalid.                Estrada\n\nconceded that he forged the letter from P&B stating that he was\n\nemployed, and the IJ found that if the true information about\n\nEstrada's employment situation had been submitted to the consulate,\n\nneither the labor certification nor the employment-based visas\n\nwould have issued.      We are hardly \"compelled to conclude to the\n\ncontrary\" on this record, and we see no basis for saying that the\n\ndecision that the Estradas were ineligible for admission to the\n\nUnited States was \"manifestly contrary to law.\"               The Estradas'\n\ntheory implies that one whose fraud goes undetected for a short\n\nwhile is entitled, simply because the INS did not detect the matter\n\nright away, to enter the United States and stay here indefinitely\n\n\n\n\n                                   -26-\n\fwith an unrevokable visa, whatever its actual invalidity.                  We\n\nreject this theory.\n\n           2.       Denial of Various Forms of Relief\n\n           Finally, the Estradas say that they did not voluntarily\n\nwaive their right to apply for \"non-ABC\" asylum, and they seek\n\nleave to apply for this relief now.       They say there is a difference\n\nbetween a \"defensive\" asylum claim raised before an IJ and an ABC\n\nasylum claim, and that if had they filed claims for defensive\n\nasylum before the IJ, they \"would have certainly acquiesced in the\n\nIJ's ruling\" on administrative closure and would have been waiving\n\ntheir ABC claim.     We see no basis for the argument.\n\n           Whether or not \"defensive\" asylum is different from ABC\n\nasylum, the INS had determined that Estrada was ineligible for\n\nbenefits under the ABC Agreement, and the IJ had decided that\n\nadministrative closure was improper, in deference to the INS'\n\ndetermination.      The Estradas were required to seek from the IJ\n\nwhatever   relief   they   hoped   to   get.    Indeed,   they     did   seek\n\nsuspension of deportation and waivers of inadmissibility.                Those\n\nforms of relief are clearly different from what the Estradas call\n\n\"ABC asylum,\" and it is not clear how seeking \"defensive asylum,\"\n\nwhich the Estradas say is also different, would have been any more\n\nof a waiver of their rights under the ABC Agreement.                 As the\n\nEstradas concede, they were provided numerous opportunities to\n\ncontinue   to    apply   for   asylum   after   they   indicated    at    the\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\fcommencement of their exclusion proceedings that they would be\n\nseeking such relief, and they refused to do so.13   It was not error\n\nfor the BIA to deem the applications for asylum abandoned.14\n\n                               III.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     13\n       By expressly telling the IJ that he would not be pursuing\nan asylum application, Estrada also effectively withdrew the\napplication for asylum he had filed in 1992.\n     14\n       In the September 25, 1997 proceeding before the IJ, counsel\nfor the petitioners also expressed hesitation in filing an asylum\napplication in light of the penalties for frivolous applications.\n     The Estradas make no argument in their petition for review as\nto withholding of removal, so any such argument is waived, and in\nany case fails for the abandonment reason discussed above.      As\nalready stated, the Estradas have also waived any argument they\nmight have had as to suspension of deportation and waivers of\ninadmissibility.\n\n                               -28-\n\f",

The case involves aspects of the ABC Agreement, concerning special procedures for certain Salvadorans and Guatemalans who enter the United States. <i>See Am. Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh,</i> 760 F.Supp. 796 (N.D.Cal.1991). It raises one legal issue about interpretation of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1155 (1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petitioners are natives and citizens of Guatemala, who entered the United States illegally. The Immigration Judge ordered them excluded and deported, deemed their applications for asylum and withholding of deportation abandoned, and determined that they were ineligible for waivers of inadmissibility and suspension of deportation. The Board of Immigration Appeals denied petitioners' appeal from that decision. This is a petition for review of that order of the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This case raises two sets of issues. One set arises over the question of whether the petitioners are eligible for benefits under the ABC Agreement. The government denies this court has jurisdiction over such claims. We do not decide those jurisdictional issues. Rather, we find petitioners have waived their claim by strategic decisions on their part.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the second set of issues, the usual petition for review claims (pertaining to petitioners' excludability as charged and to asylum), the respondent agrees that this court has jurisdiction. We deny the petition for review. In doing so, we also uphold the interpretation by the BIA and the IJ of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1155 (1994) that aliens who present themselves at a point of entry in the United States based on visa petitions fraudulently obtained in circumstances such as these are inadmissible and not entitled to entry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basic facts of this case are not in dispute. Estrada first entered the United States without inspection in 1985. On October 9, 1985, Estrada became an employee of P &amp; B Manufacturing (\"P &amp; B\") in Rhode Island; he worked as a jewelry polisher. In 1989, P &amp; B filed with the Department of Labor, on Estrada's behalf, an Application for Alien Employment Certification. Later, P &amp; B also filed with the INS<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> a Petition for Prospective Immigrant Employee (Form I-140). This petition was approved on April 26, 1993. By then, in fact since August 9, 1991, Estrada had been laid off, but he did not notify the INS. After being laid off, Estrada did not work at P &amp; B other than as a subcontractor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, in July 1991, Estrada filed a form with the INS in order to register as a class member under the ABC Agreement. The ABC Agreement is a class action settlement agreement that was approved in <i>American Baptist Churches,</i> 760 F.Supp. 796. \"The ABC litigation arose out of systemic challenges by certain Salvadorans and Guatemalans in the United States to the processing of asylum claims filed under ... 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a).\" <i>Matter of Morales,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 130, 132 (BIA 1996). The ABC agreement \"contemplates a special procedure under which alien class members are entitled, under certain specified conditions, to new proceedings before the [INS] to determine their right to asylum or any other rights and benefits established under the agreement.\" <i>Id.</i> The ABC Agreement provides that during those special new proceedings, the pending case before the IJ is to be administratively closed. <i>Id.</i> at 134.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1992, Estrada applied for asylum, listing his children on the application.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1995, Estrada went to Guatemala. He says his trip \"was taken solely to bring his children\" back to the United States, and that claim does not seem to be in dispute. Estrada went to the United States Consulate in Guatemala City to obtain his immigrant visa. There, he presented a forged letter, purportedly from P &amp; B, indicating that he continued to be employed full-time by P &amp; B. Of course, Estrada had not been so employed since 1991. Unaware of the fraud, the consulate issued the visa on September 12, 1995, on the basis of an approved labor certification. Estrada and his children then attempted to enter the United States on October 1, 1995, but the INS detained them because the INS inspector could not find an approved labor certification among the documents. The INS paroled Estrada and his children into the United States for deferred inspection by the INS office in Providence, Rhode Island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 24, 1995, an immigration inspector sent a letter to P &amp; B, requesting, inter alia, information regarding Estrada's employment. A representative of P &amp; B replied with a letter stating that the letter Estrada had presented to the consulate was a forgery, and that Estrada had not been employed by P &amp; B since 1991. On November 8, 1995, P &amp; B withdrew the Petition for Prospective Immigrant Employee (Form I-140) that it had previously filed on Estrada's behalf. A week later, on November 15, 1995, the INS placed the Estradas in exclusion proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was an initial hearing before an IJ on October 1, 1996. The INS alleged that the Estradas were excludable on two grounds: first, they lacked a valid labor certification, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(5)(A)(i); and second, they were immigrants without valid unexpired immigrant visas, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I). The Estradas denied that they were excludable as charged, and they indicated that they sought the opportunity to apply for admission as lawful permanent residents, termination of the proceedings, asylum, withholding of deportation, suspension of deportation, and waivers of excludability under &#167; 212(d)(3) and (k) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(3), (k).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a hearing on January 7, 1997, before a second IJ, the parties agreed to stipulate to the historical facts just described. The IJ noted that in addition to the question of excludability on the grounds charged, there was a question of whether the proceedings should be administratively closed pursuant to the ABC Agreement, as the Estradas had requested. The IJ reset the proceedings on the latter question, and on other issues not pertinent here, for a later date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 4, 1997, an INS asylum office director sent a letter to Estrada. The letter stated:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Information submitted to this office by INS Litigation Unit, Boston reflects that you attempted to enter the United States at Miami International Airport on October 1, 1995, without valid immigration documents.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Settlement Agreement in <i>American Baptist Churches v. Thornburgh,</i> 760 F.Supp. 796 (N.D.Cal.1991) (ABC), provides that class members apprehended at the time of entry after December 19, 1990, shall not be eligible for its benefits. See Paragraph 2 of the Settlement Agreement. Based on the above facts, it is determined that you are ineligible for benefits under the ABC Settlement Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is, the INS' position was that while Estrada may have originally been within the ABC class, he was not \"eligible for its benefits.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 4, 1997, Estrada brought an action in the District Court for Rhode Island. He sought a declaration that he was entitled to ABC benefits, and he sought an injunction against continuation of the regular exclusion proceedings until his rights under the agreement were honored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 2, 1997, the IJ issued a written decision resolving several of the issues in the case. She held that exclusion proceedings were appropriate and that the Estradas were excludable as charged; in so holding, she rejected the Estradas' argument that, because they had already begun their journey to the United States when the visa petition was withdrawn, they had valid visas, they were entitled to enter the United States, and they were entitled to lawful permanent resident status. The IJ also held that the family was not entitled to administrative closure of the case before her under the ABC Agreement so that a special ABC Agreement hearing could be held.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ held that the Estradas were properly in exclusion proceedings because \"[o]nce the [INS] determined that the validity of [Estrada's] underlying labor certification was at issue, it had the right to deny [the Estradas] entrance to the United States and place [them] in exclusion proceedings.\" P &amp; B did not withdraw the petition it had earlier filed on Estrada's behalf until after Estrada had already commenced his journey to the United States, and therefore, the IJ reasoned, the withdrawal did not serve to automatically revoke Estrada's employment-based visa. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 205.1(3). Nonetheless, the IJ found that the withdrawal by the employer was still \"significant.\" The mere fact that there was no automatic revocation did not mean that the Estradas' visas were in fact valid and that the family was in fact entitled to seek lawful permanent resident status. The IJ noted that under former INA &#167; 221(h), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1201(h) (1994), nothing in the Immigration and Nationality Act entitled an alien, even one who had an approved visa at the time he commenced his journey, to enter the United States, if upon arrival, he is found inadmissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ sustained the two charges of excludability. First, the IJ analyzed the validity of Estrada's visa, taking into account the underlying visa petition and the employment relationship on which it depended. The IJ noted that the visa was based on an approved labor certification purportedly filed by P &amp; B, and that as part of that process, Estrada submitted to the consulate a forged letter stating that he was a full-time employee of P &amp; B. The IJ also noted that P &amp; B's representative had, in fact, refused to write for Estrada a letter stating that Estrada was still employed by P &amp; B, and had instead written a letter explaining that Estrada had been laid off on August 9, 1991, and the IJ found that \"[i]f such a letter had been submitted in support of the labor certification and the employment-based visa, . . . neither would have been granted.\" The IJ concluded that P &amp; B was unwilling to serve as petitioner on Estrada's behalf, that Estrada \"was not entitled to the status accorded to him by the visa petition,\" and that \"the labor certification was improvidently issued.\" The IJ held that \"the visa issued to [the Estradas] was invalid and . . . [they are] excludable\" as charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for administrative closure under the ABC Agreement, the IJ noted that neither she nor the BIA had jurisdiction to review the INS' determination of an alien's eligibility for benefits under the ABC agreement. Here, the INS had already determined that the Estradas were not entitled to benefits under the agreement, as shown in the February 4, 1997 letter. In light of that determination, the IJ concluded that administrative closure was not appropriate. The IJ noted that, aside from the ABC agreement, the Estradas could still pursue applications for asylum and withholding of deportation before the Immigration Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ's September 2, 1997 decision concluded with two orders: (1) the charges of excludability were sustained, and (2) the motion to administratively close the proceedings was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exclusion proceedings resumed on September 25, 1997. During that proceeding, the IJ orally incorporated her September 2 written decision. She gave the Estradas until January 12, 1998 to either apply for asylum or advise the Immigration Court that they were not seeking such relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final proceedings before the IJ occurred on January 22, 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Counsel for the Estradas informed the IJ that the Estradas were not going to file applications for asylum because they felt that to do so \"would be giving up procedural due process rights that they have to an administrative political asylum hearing as they are registered ABC class members.\" The IJ concluded the January 22 proceedings by issuing oral rulings resolving the remaining issues in the case: she incorporated her prior written decision of September 2 and her oral decision of September 25; she deemed the Estradas' applications for asylum and withholding of deportation abandoned; and she ordered the Estradas excluded as charged and deported. That same day, the IJ's final oral decision was also embodied in written form.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Estradas appealed the IJ's orders to the BIA. They argued that they were not excludable because the visa petition was withdrawn after they arrived in the United States, and the withdrawal was consequently not valid and did not work a revocation of the visa petition underlying their visas. \"[I]t follows [that the Estradas] have valid visa petitions and they should therefore be admitted as . . . lawful permanent residents.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Estradas also argued that Estrada was a registered ABC class member who was entitled to administrative closure of the proceedings before the IJ in favor of the ABC Agreement special proceedings. Citing <i>Matter of Morales,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 130, they argued that Estrada's departure from the country and his apprehension upon reentry did not divest him of his rights under the ABC Agreement. They added that the asylum office's determination of Estrada's ineligibility for ABC benefits had been made without a hearing or other \"due process safeguards.\" The Estradas mentioned the ABC-related action they had brought in the federal district court, but they stated that that court had not yet decided the matter. The Estradas' brief on appeal to the BIA was dated August 31, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Estradas also argued that the IJ erred in deeming their applications for asylum and withholding of deportation abandoned, because being forced to apply for such relief in exclusion proceedings would have violated their rights under the ABC Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 16, 1999, during the pendency of the Estradas' appeal to the BIA, the district court decided the case Estrada had earlier filed. The government had moved to dismiss Estrada's claim for injunctive relief and moved for summary judgment on Estrada's claim for declaratory relief. The court granted the government's motion to dismiss with respect to Estrada's claim for injunctive relief, finding that 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(g) had divested the court of jurisdiction to enjoin the exclusion proceeding. The government conceded the court had jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment part of the case. The court, however, noted that it had discretion whether to issue a declaratory judgment. The court declined to exercise its jurisdiction, noting that \"adjudicating Estrada's claim for a declaratory judgment. . . would result in parallel litigation in which issues arising from a single dispute would be litigated in different fora, thereby resulting in duplication of effort and either piecemeal litigation or the possibility of inconsistent results or both.\" The court denied the government's motion for summary judgment with respect to Estrada's claim for declaratory relief, and it gave Estrada twenty days to show cause as to why his claim for declaratory judgment should not be dismissed without prejudice. On October 14, 1999, the court dismissed Estrada's complaint without prejudice, stating that he had failed to show cause. Estrada had not filed anything in the district court after the September 16 order, nor did he file anything after October 14, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the certified administrative record indicates that the Estradas ever brought the district court's decision to the attention of the BIA, even though their appeal was still pending before the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 15, 2003, the BIA dismissed the Estradas' appeal from the IJ's decision. The BIA agreed with the IJ on the appropriateness of exclusion proceedings and on excludability as charged, for essentially the same reasons as those cited by the IJ. The BIA stated that administrative closure under the ABC Agreement would not have been appropriate, because the INS had already made a determination that Estrada had no right to benefits under the agreement. The BIA did not mention Estrada's suit in the district court, which had been brought to the BIA's attention, or the district court's ultimate decision, which had not. Finally, the BIA noted that the IJ gave Estrada numerous opportunities to apply for asylum and withholding, but he refused to apply, and held that the IJ did not err in determining that those applications were abandoned.

They say they were deprived of due process, because the INS reached the determination in its letter of February 4, 1997, without giving the family notice or an opportunity to present evidence. Because the INS' determination that Estrada was not entitled to ABC benefits was procedurally unsound, it amounted, the Estradas say, to \"nothing\" &#8212; essentially no determination at all &#8212; and the IJ and BIA erred in refusing to allow administrative closure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Estradas stress that none of the Paragraph 17 disqualifiers apply. Their case for eligibility is that the \"apprehended at time of entry after\" December 19, 1990 provision does not apply to them: once Estrada registered and filed an asylum request which listed his children, they say, their \"rights under the ABC agreement were vested.\" In the Estradas' view, once their rights vested, nothing in the ABC Agreement provides for the loss of their rights simply because Estrada departed and the family subsequently came to the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responds that the INS determined that Estrada was ineligible for ABC benefits, that this determination was not reviewable by the IJ or by the BIA, <i>see Matter of Morales,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 134-35, and that this court has no jurisdiction to consider any of the Estradas' ABC-related challenges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government says the ABC Agreement \"specifically provides for determination of [eligibility for ABC benefits] in a district court, not pursuant to a petition for review in a court of appeals.\" In the government's view, jurisdiction once existed in the district court, but Estrada squandered his chance there by failing to respond to the show-cause order and/or to appeal the district court's decision. The government also stresses that the Estradas never advised the BIA of the district court's decision, and that they never moved to reopen while the case was pending. The government says that in the posture of this case &#8212; a petition for review of the BIA's decision, and not an appeal from the district court &#8212; this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the Estradas' eligibility for ABC benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, this court raised the possibility of transferring the present ABC issue to the District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The government opposes such a transfer on two grounds. First, it says, the petition for review of the BIA decision could not have been brought in the district court in the first instance, so transfer is improper under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631, which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whenever a civil action is filed in a court . . . or an appeal, including a petition for review of administrative action, is noticed for or filed with . . . a court and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action or appeal to <i>any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed</i> . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631 (emphasis added). The government's second argument is that it is not \"in the interest of justice\" to transfer this issue to the district court, because Estrada failed to respond to the show-cause order, did not appeal the district court's decision, and did not even advise the BIA of the district court's decision. The Estradas counter that jurisdiction in the district court would be proper, and that transfer would be in the interest of justice; they say they \"have raised and preserved the ABC issue throughout the course of the litigation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not delve into the merits of the government's various jurisdictional challenges on the ABC issues. Instead, we rest on the ground that, on these facts, the petitioners have waived consideration of the ABC issue by this court or by the district court (even assuming a transfer).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estrada never showed cause to the district court as to why his case based on a claim for ABC benefits should not be dismissed, and he never appealed the decision of the district court. The Estradas argued before the BIA that they were entitled to administrative closure under the ABC Agreement, noted that they had not received a hearing before an asylum officer on the matter, and alerted the BIA to the fact that Estrada had filed a case in the district court. But they never told the BIA how that case was decided or that the district court could have been viewed as deferring the ABC issue back to the agency. They had ample opportunity to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court issued its memorandum and show-cause order on September 16, 1999, and it dismissed Estrada's complaint for failure to show cause on October 14, 1999, but the BIA did not decide the Estradas' appeal from the IJ's decision until April 15, 2003. The BIA did not address the proper response to the district court's decision because it was not asked to. <i>Cf. Xu v. Gonzales,</i> 424 F.3d 45, 48-49 (1st Cir.2005) (where point was not argued in appeal from IJ's decision, BIA was under no obligation to address point, and issue was waived and would not be considered by this court). Rather, the Estradas chose to cause delay, which benefitted them by keeping them in the United States. The dismissal of Estrada's action in the district court was more than six years ago. Estrada is not entitled to reopen it now. Taken together, the various omissions amount to waiver, and we will neither consider the ABC issue nor transfer it to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Conventional Petition for Review Claims</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Excludability as Charged</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Estradas' second line of attack goes to the IJ/BIA determination that they were in fact excludable as charged: they say that Estrada was not attempting a new entry and that the government did not properly revoke their immigrant visas before they commenced their journey to the United States. This presents the mixed standard of review: the factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, <i>see Ang v. Gonzales,</i> 430 F.3d 50, 54-55 (1st Cir.2005); the BIA's interpretations of law are reviewed with deference, <i>see Elien,</i> 364 F.3d at 396-97.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">a. <i>New Entry</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As to the \"new entry\" issue, the Estradas say that once Estrada was \"accorded protected registered class status under the ABC agreement after his initial entry in 1985, he kept that status intact when entering the United States subsequent to the ABC agreement preliminary approval date of December 19, 1990.\" The Estradas say that in light of Estrada's status as a registered ABC class member, his \"first and only entry\" was in October 1985, his 1995 arrival should not have been deemed a new entry, and the children's status is the same. They say their situation involved merely an \"innocent, casual, and brief\" departure. <i>Rosenberg v. Fleuti,</i> 374 U.S. 449, 462, 83 S.Ct. 1804, 10 L.Ed.2d 1000 (1963). Whatever the merits of this argument, the government points out that it was not raised before the BIA. Although the Estradas clearly invoked the ABC Agreement before the BIA, they did so only as to administrative closure, and they did not articulate an \"innocent, casual, and brief\" argument before the BIA. The argument is therefore waived. <i>See Chen v. Gonzales,</i> 415 F.3d 151, 154 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">b. <i>Timing of Withdrawal of Visa Petition</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Estradas also argue that because their visas were not revoked prior to the commencement of their journey to the United States, they should have been allowed entry, and the BIA erred in holding them excludable as charged.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> They say that once the government discovered that the letter presented to the consulate was a forgery, the appropriate response was to put the family in deportation proceedings; they also say this would have made them eligible for relief that was not available in exclusion proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">i. <i>Appropriateness of Exclusion Proceedings</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Estradas base their argument on former INA &#167; 205, which, before the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), Pub.L. No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-546 (1996), provided that revocation of the approval of any visa petition will not have effect unless there is notice prior to the petition beneficiary's commencement of travel to the United States. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1155 (1994). Their argument is that the fact that withdrawal of the visa petition occurred after their journey had commenced (and indeed, not until well after they had been paroled into the United States) means that the withdrawal was not valid and did not result in revocation of the approval of their visa petition, and that they should have been put into deportation proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Estradas' conclusion is contrary to the BIA's reasonable interpretation of the statutory text.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The last sentence of &#167; 1155 then provided that \"[i]f notice of revocation is not so given, and the beneficiary applies for admission to the United States, his admissibility shall be determined in the manner provided for by sections 1225 and 1226 of this title.\" <i>Id.</i> The pre-IIRIRA versions of &#167;&#167; 1225 and 1226 dealt with exclusion, not deportation, procedures. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1225, 1226 (1994). It was reasonable for the BIA to conclude that the only consequence of failure to notify before travel was that the right to admission would be adjudicated in exclusion proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Furthermore, INA &#167; 221(h) provided at the time that \"[n]othing in this chapter shall be construed to entitle any alien, to whom a visa or other documentation has been issued, to enter the United States, if, upon arrival . . . he is found to be inadmissible.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1201(h) (1994). The IJ found that this is what happened here, and quoted this exact language. The BIA agreed with the IJ.

The charged grounds of excludability were 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(5)(A)(i)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and (a)(7)(A)(i)(I).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The BIA reasonably interpreted &#167; 1155 and concluded that nothing about the timing of P &amp; B's withdrawal of the petition rendered the Estradas' labor certifications or immigrant visas automatically valid. The BIA cited its decision in <i>Matter of Alarcon,</i> 17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 574, which rejected the argument that \"since [the alien] was not notified that her visa petition was revoked before she came to this country, her visa petition and, therefore, her visa were still valid.\" <i>Id.</i> at 575. Instead, the BIA said, the IJ should \"examine[] the applicant's visa to determine its validity,\" reaching a decision \"inherently involv[ing] scrutiny of the underlying visa petition and the relationship on which it depends.\" <i>Id.</i> at 576. \"If [the IJ] determines that a flaw exists in that relationship such that the alien was not actually entitled to the status which was accorded to him by the visa petition, the [IJ] may conclude that the visa is invalid.\" <i>Id.</i> This can hardly be said to be an unreasonable interpretation of the immigration statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Estradas fare no better with respect to the BIA's factual findings and application of law to facts. The BIA agreed with the IJ that the visas, visa petition, and labor certification were based on fraudulent information and were invalid. Estrada conceded that he forged the letter from P &amp; B stating that he was employed, and the IJ found that if the true information about Estrada's employment situation had been submitted to the consulate, neither the labor certification nor the employment-based visas would have issued. We are hardly \"compelled to conclude to the contrary\" on this record, and we see no basis for saying that the decision that the Estradas were ineligible for admission to the United States was \"manifestly contrary to law.\" The Estradas' theory implies that one whose fraud goes undetected for a short while is entitled, simply because the INS did not detect the matter right away, to enter the United States and stay here indefinitely with an unrevokable visa, whatever its actual invalidity. We reject this theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Denial of Various Forms of Relief</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Estradas say that they did not voluntarily waive their right to apply for \"non-ABC\" asylum, and they seek leave to apply for this relief now. They say there is a difference between a \"defensive\" asylum claim raised before an IJ and an ABC asylum claim, and that if had they filed claims for defensive asylum before the IJ, they \"would have certainly acquiesced in the IJ's ruling\" on administrative closure and would have been waiving their ABC claim. We see no basis for the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not \"defensive\" asylum is different from ABC asylum, the INS had determined that Estrada was ineligible for benefits under the ABC Agreement, and the IJ had decided that administrative closure was improper, in deference to the INS' determination. The Estradas were required to seek from the IJ whatever relief they hoped to get. Indeed, they did seek suspension of deportation and waivers of inadmissibility. Those forms of relief are clearly different from what the Estradas call \"ABC asylum,\" and it is not clear how seeking \"defensive asylum,\" which the Estradas say is also different, would have been any more of a waiver of their rights under the ABC Agreement. As the Estradas concede, they were provided numerous opportunities to continue to apply for asylum after they indicated at the commencement of their exclusion proceedings that they would be seeking such relief, and they refused to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> It was not error for the BIA to deem the applications for asylum abandoned.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On March 1, 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security, and the INS subsequently ceased to exist<i>See</i> Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L.

We deny the petition for review. In doing so, we also uphold the interpretation by the BIA and the IJ of 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1155 (1994) that aliens who present themselves at a point of entry in the United States based on visa petitions fraudulently obtained in circumstances such as these are inadmissible and not entitled to entry.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The basic facts of this case are not in dispute. Estrada first entered the United States without inspection in 1985. On October 9, 1985, Estrada became an employee of P &amp; B Manufacturing (\"P &amp; B\") in Rhode Island; he worked as a jewelry polisher. In 1989, P &amp; B filed with the Department of Labor, on Estrada's behalf, an Application for Alien Employment Certification. Later, P &amp; B also filed with the INS<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> a Petition for Prospective Immigrant Employee (Form I-140). This petition was approved on April 26, 1993. By then, in fact since August 9, 1991, Estrada had been laid off, but he did not notify the INS. After being laid off, Estrada did not work at P &amp; B other than as a subcontractor.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, in July 1991, Estrada filed a form with the INS in order to register as a class member under the ABC Agreement. The ABC Agreement is a class action settlement agreement that was approved in <i>American Baptist Churches,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1421304\"><a href=\"/opinion/1421304/american-baptist-churches-v-thornburgh/\"><span class=\"volume\">760</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Dec. 130, 132 (BIA 1996). The ABC agreement \"contemplates a special procedure under which alien class members are entitled, under certain specified conditions, to new proceedings before the [INS] to determine their right to asylum or any other rights and benefits established under the agreement.\" <i>Id.</i> The ABC Agreement provides that during those special new proceedings, the pending case before the IJ is to be administratively closed. <i>Id.</i> at 134.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In March 1992, Estrada applied for asylum, listing his children on the application.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In June 1995, Estrada went to Guatemala. He says his trip \"was taken solely to bring his children\" back to the United States, and that claim does not seem to be in dispute. Estrada went to the United States Consulate in Guatemala City to obtain his immigrant visa. There, he presented a forged letter, purportedly from P &amp; B, indicating that he continued to be employed full-time by P &amp; B. Of course, Estrada had not been so employed since 1991. Unaware of the fraud, the consulate issued the visa on September 12, 1995, on the basis of an approved labor certification. Estrada and his children then attempted to enter the United States on October 1, 1995, but the INS detained them because the INS inspector could not find an approved labor certification among the documents. The INS paroled Estrada and his children into the United States for deferred inspection by the INS office in Providence, Rhode Island.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On October 24, 1995, an immigration inspector sent a letter to P &amp; B, requesting, inter alia, information regarding Estrada's employment. A representative of P &amp; B replied with a letter stating that the letter Estrada had presented to the consulate was a forgery, and that Estrada had not been employed by P &amp; B since 1991. On November 8, 1995, P &amp; B withdrew the Petition for Prospective Immigrant Employee (Form I-140) that it had previously filed on Estrada's behalf. A week later, on November 15, 1995, the INS placed the Estradas in exclusion proceedings.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There was an initial hearing before an IJ on October 1, 1996. The INS alleged that the Estradas were excludable on two grounds: first, they lacked a valid labor certification, <i>see</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(5)(A)(i); and second, they were immigrants without valid unexpired immigrant visas, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 1182(a)(7)(A)(i)(I). The Estradas denied that they were excludable as charged, and they indicated that they sought the opportunity to apply for admission as lawful permanent residents, termination of the proceedings, asylum, withholding of deportation, suspension of deportation, and waivers of excludability under &#167; 212(d)(3) and (k) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(d)(3), (k).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At a hearing on January 7, 1997, before a second IJ, the parties agreed to stipulate to the historical facts just described. The IJ noted that in addition to the question of excludability on the grounds charged, there was a question of whether the proceedings should be administratively closed pursuant to the ABC Agreement, as the Estradas had requested. The IJ reset the proceedings on the latter question, and on other issues not pertinent here, for a later date.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On February 4, 1997, an INS asylum office director sent a letter to Estrada.

Supp.</span> <span class=\"page\">796</span></a></span> (N.D.Cal.1991) (ABC), provides that class members apprehended at the time of entry after December 19, 1990, shall not be eligible for its benefits. See Paragraph 2 of the Settlement Agreement. Based on the above facts, it is determined that you are ineligible for benefits under the ABC Settlement Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That is, the INS' position was that while Estrada may have originally been within the ABC class, he was not \"eligible for its benefits.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 4, 1997, Estrada brought an action in the District Court for Rhode Island. He sought a declaration that he was entitled to ABC benefits, and he sought an injunction against continuation of the regular exclusion proceedings until his rights under the agreement were honored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 2, 1997, the IJ issued a written decision resolving several of the issues in the case. She held that exclusion proceedings were appropriate and that the Estradas were excludable as charged; in so holding, she rejected the Estradas' argument that, because they had already begun their journey to the United States when the visa petition was withdrawn, they had valid visas, they were entitled to enter the United States, and they were entitled to lawful permanent resident status. The IJ also held that the family was not entitled to administrative closure of the case before her under the ABC Agreement so that a special ABC Agreement hearing could be held.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ held that the Estradas were properly in exclusion proceedings because \"[o]nce the [INS] determined that the validity of [Estrada's] underlying labor certification was at issue, it had the right to deny [the Estradas] entrance to the United States and place [them] in exclusion proceedings.\" P &amp; B did not withdraw the petition it had earlier filed on Estrada's behalf until after Estrada had already commenced his journey to the United States, and therefore, the IJ reasoned, the withdrawal did not serve to automatically revoke Estrada's employment-based visa. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 205.1(3). Nonetheless, the IJ found that the withdrawal by the employer was still \"significant.\" The mere fact that there was no automatic revocation did not mean that the Estradas' visas were in fact valid and that the family was in fact entitled to seek lawful permanent resident status. The IJ noted that under former INA &#167; 221(h), 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1201(h) (1994), nothing in the Immigration and Nationality Act entitled an alien, even one who had an approved visa at the time he commenced his journey, to enter the United States, if upon arrival, he is found inadmissible.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ sustained the two charges of excludability. First, the IJ analyzed the validity of Estrada's visa, taking into account the underlying visa petition and the employment relationship on which it depended. The IJ noted that the visa was based on an approved labor certification purportedly filed by P &amp; B, and that as part of that process, Estrada submitted to the consulate a forged letter stating that he was a full-time employee of P &amp; B. The IJ also noted that P &amp; B's representative had, in fact, refused to write for Estrada a letter stating that Estrada was still employed by P &amp; B, and had instead written a letter explaining that Estrada had been laid off on August 9, 1991, and the IJ found that \"[i]f such a letter had been submitted in support of the labor certification and the employment-based visa, . . . neither would have been granted.\" The IJ concluded that P &amp; B was unwilling to serve as petitioner on Estrada's behalf, that Estrada \"was not entitled to the status accorded to him by the visa petition,\" and that \"the labor certification was improvidently issued.\" The IJ held that \"the visa issued to [the Estradas] was invalid and . . . [they are] excludable\" as charged.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As for administrative closure under the ABC Agreement, the IJ noted that neither she nor the BIA had jurisdiction to review the INS' determination of an alien's eligibility for benefits under the ABC agreement. Here, the INS had already determined that the Estradas were not entitled to benefits under the agreement, as shown in the February 4, 1997 letter. In light of that determination, the IJ concluded that administrative closure was not appropriate. The IJ noted that, aside from the ABC agreement, the Estradas could still pursue applications for asylum and withholding of deportation before the Immigration Court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ's September 2, 1997 decision concluded with two orders: (1) the charges of excludability were sustained, and (2) the motion to administratively close the proceedings was denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The exclusion proceedings resumed on September 25, 1997. During that proceeding, the IJ orally incorporated her September 2 written decision. She gave the Estradas until January 12, 1998 to either apply for asylum or advise the Immigration Court that they were not seeking such relief.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The final proceedings before the IJ occurred on January 22, 1998.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Counsel for the Estradas informed the IJ that the Estradas were not going to file applications for asylum because they felt that to do so \"would be giving up procedural due process rights that they have to an administrative political asylum hearing as they are registered ABC class members.\" The IJ concluded the January 22 proceedings by issuing oral rulings resolving the remaining issues in the case: she incorporated her prior written decision of September 2 and her oral decision of September 25; she deemed the Estradas' applications for asylum and withholding of deportation abandoned; and she ordered the Estradas excluded as charged and deported. That same day, the IJ's final oral decision was also embodied in written form.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Estradas appealed the IJ's orders to the BIA. They argued that they were not excludable because the visa petition was withdrawn after they arrived in the United States, and the withdrawal was consequently not valid and did not work a revocation of the visa petition underlying their visas. \"[I]t follows [that the Estradas] have valid visa petitions and they should therefore be admitted as . . . lawful permanent residents.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Estradas also argued that Estrada was a registered ABC class member who was entitled to administrative closure of the proceedings before the IJ in favor of the ABC Agreement special proceedings. Citing <i>Matter of Morales,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 130, they argued that Estrada's departure from the country and his apprehension upon reentry did not divest him of his rights under the ABC Agreement. They added that the asylum office's determination of Estrada's ineligibility for ABC benefits had been made without a hearing or other \"due process safeguards.\" The Estradas mentioned the ABC-related action they had brought in the federal district court, but they stated that that court had not yet decided the matter. The Estradas' brief on appeal to the BIA was dated August 31, 1998.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Estradas also argued that the IJ erred in deeming their applications for asylum and withholding of deportation abandoned, because being forced to apply for such relief in exclusion proceedings would have violated their rights under the ABC Agreement.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 16, 1999, during the pendency of the Estradas' appeal to the BIA, the district court decided the case Estrada had earlier filed. The government had moved to dismiss Estrada's claim for injunctive relief and moved for summary judgment on Estrada's claim for declaratory relief. The court granted the government's motion to dismiss with respect to Estrada's claim for injunctive relief, finding that 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252(g) had divested the court of jurisdiction to enjoin the exclusion proceeding. The government conceded the court had jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment part of the case. The court, however, noted that it had discretion whether to issue a declaratory judgment. The court declined to exercise its jurisdiction, noting that \"adjudicating Estrada's claim for a declaratory judgment. . . would result in parallel litigation in which issues arising from a single dispute would be litigated in different fora, thereby resulting in duplication of effort and either piecemeal litigation or the possibility of inconsistent results or both.\" The court denied the government's motion for summary judgment with respect to Estrada's claim for declaratory relief, and it gave Estrada twenty days to show cause as to why his claim for declaratory judgment should not be dismissed without prejudice. On October 14, 1999, the court dismissed Estrada's complaint without prejudice, stating that he had failed to show cause. Estrada had not filed anything in the district court after the September 16 order, nor did he file anything after October 14, 1999.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Nothing in the certified administrative record indicates that the Estradas ever brought the district court's decision to the attention of the BIA, even though their appeal was still pending before the BIA.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 15, 2003, the BIA dismissed the Estradas' appeal from the IJ's decision.

The BIA stated that administrative closure under the ABC Agreement would not have been appropriate, because the INS had already made a determination that Estrada had no right to benefits under the agreement. The BIA did not mention Estrada's suit in the district court, which had been brought to the BIA's attention, or the district court's ultimate decision, which had not. Finally, the BIA noted that the IJ gave Estrada numerous opportunities to apply for asylum and withholding, but he refused to apply, and held that the IJ did not err in determining that those applications were abandoned.

They say they were deprived of due process, because the INS reached the determination in its letter of February 4, 1997, without giving the family notice or an opportunity to present evidence. Because the INS' determination that Estrada was not entitled to ABC benefits was procedurally unsound, it amounted, the Estradas say, to \"nothing\" &#8212; essentially no determination at all &#8212; and the IJ and BIA erred in refusing to allow administrative closure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Estradas stress that none of the Paragraph 17 disqualifiers apply. Their case for eligibility is that the \"apprehended at time of entry after\" December 19, 1990 provision does not apply to them: once Estrada registered and filed an asylum request which listed his children, they say, their \"rights under the ABC agreement were vested.\" In the Estradas' view, once their rights vested, nothing in the ABC Agreement provides for the loss of their rights simply because Estrada departed and the family subsequently came to the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government responds that the INS determined that Estrada was ineligible for ABC benefits, that this determination was not reviewable by the IJ or by the BIA, <i>see Matter of Morales,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 134-35, and that this court has no jurisdiction to consider any of the Estradas' ABC-related challenges.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The government says the ABC Agreement \"specifically provides for determination of [eligibility for ABC benefits] in a district court, not pursuant to a petition for review in a court of appeals.\" In the government's view, jurisdiction once existed in the district court, but Estrada squandered his chance there by failing to respond to the show-cause order and/or to appeal the district court's decision. The government also stresses that the Estradas never advised the BIA of the district court's decision, and that they never moved to reopen while the case was pending. The government says that in the posture of this case &#8212; a petition for review of the BIA's decision, and not an appeal from the district court &#8212; this court lacks jurisdiction to consider the Estradas' eligibility for ABC benefits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At oral argument, this court raised the possibility of transferring the present ABC issue to the District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The government opposes such a transfer on two grounds. First, it says, the petition for review of the BIA decision could not have been brought in the district court in the first instance, so transfer is improper under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631, which states:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whenever a civil action is filed in a court . . . or an appeal, including a petition for review of administrative action, is noticed for or filed with . . . a court and that court finds that there is a want of jurisdiction, the court shall, if it is in the interest of justice, transfer such action or appeal to <i>any other such court in which the action or appeal could have been brought at the time it was filed or noticed</i> . . . .</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">28 U.S.C. &#167; 1631 (emphasis added). The government's second argument is that it is not \"in the interest of justice\" to transfer this issue to the district court, because Estrada failed to respond to the show-cause order, did not appeal the district court's decision, and did not even advise the BIA of the district court's decision. The Estradas counter that jurisdiction in the district court would be proper, and that transfer would be in the interest of justice; they say they \"have raised and preserved the ABC issue throughout the course of the litigation.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We do not delve into the merits of the government's various jurisdictional challenges on the ABC issues. Instead, we rest on the ground that, on these facts, the petitioners have waived consideration of the ABC issue by this court or by the district court (even assuming a transfer).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Estrada never showed cause to the district court as to why his case based on a claim for ABC benefits should not be dismissed, and he never appealed the decision of the district court. The Estradas argued before the BIA that they were entitled to administrative closure under the ABC Agreement, noted that they had not received a hearing before an asylum officer on the matter, and alerted the BIA to the fact that Estrada had filed a case in the district court. But they never told the BIA how that case was decided or that the district court could have been viewed as deferring the ABC issue back to the agency. They had ample opportunity to do so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The district court issued its memorandum and show-cause order on September 16, 1999, and it dismissed Estrada's complaint for failure to show cause on October 14, 1999, but the BIA did not decide the Estradas' appeal from the IJ's decision until April 15, 2003. The BIA did not address the proper response to the district court's decision because it was not asked to. <i>Cf. Xu v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201828\"><a href=\"/opinion/201828/xu-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">45</span></a></span>, 48-49 (1st Cir.2005) (where point was not argued in appeal from IJ's decision, BIA was under no obligation to address point, and issue was waived and would not be considered by this court). Rather, the Estradas chose to cause delay, which benefitted them by keeping them in the United States. The dismissal of Estrada's action in the district court was more than six years ago. Estrada is not entitled to reopen it now. Taken together, the various omissions amount to waiver, and we will neither consider the ABC issue nor transfer it to the district court for further proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">C. <i>Conventional Petition for Review Claims</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>Excludability as Charged</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Estradas' second line of attack goes to the IJ/BIA determination that they were in fact excludable as charged: they say that Estrada was not attempting a new entry and that the government did not properly revoke their immigrant visas before they commenced their journey to the United States. This presents the mixed standard of review: the factual determinations are reviewed under the substantial evidence test, <i>see Ang v.

They say their situation involved merely an \"innocent, casual, and brief\" departure. <i>Rosenberg v. Fleuti,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106662\"><a href=\"/opinion/106662/rosenberg-v-fleuti/\"><span class=\"volume\">374</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">449</span></a></span>, 462, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"106662\"><a href=\"/opinion/106662/rosenberg-v-fleuti/\"><span class=\"volume\">83</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Although the Estradas clearly invoked the ABC Agreement before the BIA, they did so only as to administrative closure, and they did not articulate an \"innocent, casual, and brief\" argument before the BIA. The argument is therefore waived. <i>See Chen v.

No. 104-208, Div. C, 110 Stat. 3009, 3009-546 (1996), provided that revocation of the approval of any visa petition will not have effect unless there is notice prior to the petition beneficiary's commencement of travel to the United States. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1155 (1994). Their argument is that the fact that withdrawal of the visa petition occurred after their journey had commenced (and indeed, not until well after they had been paroled into the United States) means that the withdrawal was not valid and did not result in revocation of the approval of their visa petition, and that they should have been put into deportation proceedings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Estradas' conclusion is contrary to the BIA's reasonable interpretation of the statutory text.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a> The last sentence of &#167; 1155 then provided that \"[i]f notice of revocation is not so given, and the beneficiary applies for admission to the United States, his admissibility shall be determined in the manner provided for by sections 1225 and 1226 of this title.\" <i>Id.</i> The pre-IIRIRA versions of &#167;&#167; 1225 and 1226 dealt with exclusion, not deportation, procedures. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1225, 1226 (1994).

The IJ found that this is what happened here, and quoted this exact language. The BIA agreed with the IJ.

The charged grounds of excludability were 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1182(a)(5)(A)(i)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn11\" id=\"fn11_ref\">11</a> and (a)(7)(A)(i)(I).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn12\" id=\"fn12_ref\">12</a> The BIA reasonably interpreted &#167; 1155 and concluded that nothing about the timing of P &amp; B's withdrawal of the petition rendered the Estradas' labor certifications or immigrant visas automatically valid. The BIA cited its decision in <i>Matter of Alarcon,</i> 17 I. &amp; N. Dec. 574, which rejected the argument that \"since [the alien] was not notified that her visa petition was revoked before she came to this country, her visa petition and, therefore, her visa were still valid.\" <i>Id.</i> at 575. Instead, the BIA said, the IJ should \"examine[] the applicant's visa to determine its validity,\" reaching a decision \"inherently involv[ing] scrutiny of the underlying visa petition and the relationship on which it depends.\" <i>Id.</i> at 576. \"If [the IJ] determines that a flaw exists in that relationship such that the alien was not actually entitled to the status which was accorded to him by the visa petition, the [IJ] may conclude that the visa is invalid.\" <i>Id.</i> This can hardly be said to be an unreasonable interpretation of the immigration statutes.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Estradas fare no better with respect to the BIA's factual findings and application of law to facts. The BIA agreed with the IJ that the visas, visa petition, and labor certification were based on fraudulent information and were invalid. Estrada conceded that he forged the letter from P &amp; B stating that he was employed, and the IJ found that if the true information about Estrada's employment situation had been submitted to the consulate, neither the labor certification nor the employment-based visas would have issued. We are hardly \"compelled to conclude to the contrary\" on this record, and we see no basis for saying that the decision that the Estradas were ineligible for admission to the United States was \"manifestly contrary to law.\" The Estradas' theory implies that one whose fraud goes undetected for a short while is entitled, simply because the INS did not detect the matter right away, to enter the United States and stay here indefinitely with an unrevokable visa, whatever its actual invalidity. We reject this theory.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>Denial of Various Forms of Relief</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p64\">\n      <span class=\"num\">64</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the Estradas say that they did not voluntarily waive their right to apply for \"non-ABC\" asylum, and they seek leave to apply for this relief now. They say there is a difference between a \"defensive\" asylum claim raised before an IJ and an ABC asylum claim, and that if had they filed claims for defensive asylum before the IJ, they \"would have certainly acquiesced in the IJ's ruling\" on administrative closure and would have been waiving their ABC claim. We see no basis for the argument.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p65\">\n      <span class=\"num\">65</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Whether or not \"defensive\" asylum is different from ABC asylum, the INS had determined that Estrada was ineligible for benefits under the ABC Agreement, and the IJ had decided that administrative closure was improper, in deference to the INS' determination. The Estradas were required to seek from the IJ whatever relief they hoped to get. Indeed, they did seek suspension of deportation and waivers of inadmissibility. Those forms of relief are clearly different from what the Estradas call \"ABC asylum,\" and it is not clear how seeking \"defensive asylum,\" which the Estradas say is also different, would have been any more of a waiver of their rights under the ABC Agreement. As the Estradas concede, they were provided numerous opportunities to continue to apply for asylum after they indicated at the commencement of their exclusion proceedings that they would be seeking such relief, and they refused to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn13\" id=\"fn13_ref\">13</a> It was not error for the BIA to deem the applications for asylum abandoned.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn14\" id=\"fn14_ref\">14</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p66\">\n      <span class=\"num\">66</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The petition for review is <i>denied.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> On March 1, 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were transferred to the Department of Homeland Security, and the INS subsequently ceased to exist<i>See</i> Homeland Security Act of 2002, Pub.L.

Also in later proceedings, the IJ found that waivers of inadmissibility under INA &#167; 212(d)(3) and (k) did not apply. The BIA affirmed the IJ's decisions on these points. In their petition for review of the BIA's decision, the Estradas do not discuss suspension of deportation or waivers of inadmissibility, so they have waived any argument they might have made as to these forms of relief</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> On January 9, 1998, the Estradas requested a continuance, in part because the Rhode Island district court had not yet decided Estrada's case, and \"should [it] decide [the issue of eligibility for benefits under the ABC Agreement] in favor of [Estrada] then Exclusion Proceedings should be administratively closed.\" The government opposed the continuance, and the IJ denied the continuance on January 14, 1998</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> On January 22, 1998, the IJ issued for each petitioner a written order summarizing her final oral decision.

At oral argument, the government agreed that in general, district courts can review the question of entitlement to benefits under the ABC Agreement, and that this was unchanged by the REAL ID Act. The government argues that in the particular context of this case, transfer of the ABC issue to the district court would be improper, because under 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1252, as amended by the REAL ID Act of 2005, district courts lack jurisdiction over petitions for review.
