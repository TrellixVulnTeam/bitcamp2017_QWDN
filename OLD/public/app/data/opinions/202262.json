This   case   invites   us   to\n\nconsider whether 1998 revisions to the United States Tax Code\n\neliminated the historical distinction between a “levy” and an\n\n“offset” and require the same procedural protections for both. The\n\ngovernment traditionally has been thought to possess a common law\n\nright, as a creditor, to “offset,” or “set off,” funds owed to a\n\ntaxpayer and thus held by the government – without prior notice –\n\n“to reduce the taxpayer’s outstanding tax liability,”               United\n\nStates ex rel. P.J. Keating Co. v. Warren Corp., 805 F.2d 449, 451-\n\n52 & n.3 (1st Cir. 1986); see also Hankin v. United States, 891\n\nF.2d 480, 483 (3rd Cir. 1989).     A “levy,” by contrast, involves a\n\nformal notice-and-hearing process governed by statute in which the\n\ngovernment typically seeks to seize property not already within its\n\ncontrol to satisfy a taxpayer’s liability. See Belloff v. Comm’r,\n\n996 F.2d 607, 615 (2d Cir. 1993); Hankin, 891 F.2d at 483.\n\n     Appellants, a husband and wife, assert that the Internal\n\nRevenue Service (“IRS”) improperly failed to utilize the statutory\n\nlevy process when it sought to offset their joint income tax refund\n\nagainst a prior business-related tax debt owed by the husband.\n\nThey brought their case to the Tax Court, which dismissed it for\n\nlack of subject matter jurisdiction.       We affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                            I. Background\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\f       As part of a reorganization of his business under Chapter 11\n\nof the Bankruptcy Code, confirmed in 2001, appellant Kenneth B.\n\nBoyd entered into an agreement with the United States to pay off\n\ndelinquent employment taxes in a series of installments over five\n\nyears.     Two years later, the IRS notified Boyd and his wife, Marie,\n\nthat their personal income tax overpayment of $6,549 for the year\n\n2002 had been applied to that outstanding business tax liability.\n\nThe Boyds filed a protest, and the IRS agreed to refund Marie the\n\nportion of the overpayment attributable to her income – $51.\n\n       Boyd then filed an administrative request for a refund of the\n\nremaining portion of the overpayment, arguing, inter alia, that the\n\nIRS improperly failed to provide prior notice and opportunity for\n\na hearing before seizing his overpayment.                The IRS Office of\n\nAppeals rejected his request, stating that a “[r]efund offset[]” is\n\nnot considered a collection action subject to the procedural\n\nprotections Boyd claimed the agency had violated.\n\n       The Boyds next took their complaint to the Tax Court, arguing\n\nthat   a   provision   added   to   the    Tax   Code   in   1998   manifested\n\nCongress’s intent that offsets be effected by means of a formal\n\n“levy” and that, therefore, they were wrongly denied the notice and\n\nopportunity for a hearing specified for levies in 26 U.S.C. § 6330.\n\nThey invoked jurisdiction under section 6330(d), which gives the\n\nTax Court authority to review a “determination” made by the IRS\n\n\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\fOffice of Appeals following a hearing on a taxpayer’s challenge to\n\nan impending levy.\n\n     The Tax Court declined to address the merits of the Boyds’\n\nclaim – i.e., whether offsets are subject to levy procedures – on\n\nthe ground that it lacked jurisdiction.            See Boyd v. Comm’r, 124\n\nT.C. 296, 302-03 (2005).      The court ruled that, under § 6330, its\n\njurisdiction was limited to instances in which taxpayers obtain the\n\nwritten “notice of determination” that is issued by the Appeals\n\nOffice following a hearing.           See 26 U.S.C. § 6330(d); Greene-\n\nThapedi v. Comm’r, 126 T.C. 1 (2006); Lunsford v. Comm’r, 117 T.C.\n\n159, 161, 164 (2001).1      No such ruling had been issued, of course,\n\nbecause the Boyds had not been offered the opportunity for a\n\nhearing.    The    Tax    Court   further   stated   that   it   would   lack\n\njurisdiction even if it treated the offset notice that the Boyds\n\ndid receive as a notice of determination because a Tax Court appeal\n\nmust be filed within 30 days of the notice, and the Boyds filed\n\ntheir action beyond that date.        See 124 T.C. at 303.\n\n     The   Boyds   then    appealed    to   this   court,   renewing     their\n\nsubstantive argument that the 1998 revisions to the Tax Code\n\nrequired the IRS to treat the disputed offset as subject to the\n\nlevy procedural requirements.          They claim they are entitled to\n\n\n     1\n       In an unpublished opinion, this court has upheld the Tax\nCourt’s conclusion that “its jurisdiction under § 6330(d) depends\nupon the issuance of a valid notice of determination by the IRS’s\nOffice of Appeals and the filing of a timely petition for review.”\nSee Rudd v. Comm’r, 91 Fed. Appx. 699 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n                                      -4-\n\feither an order directing the Secretary of the Treasury to issue a\n\nnotice of determination, allowing them to meet the jurisdictional\n\nrequirements of the Tax Court and thus to challenge the offset in\n\nthat venue,2 or a remand to the Tax Court for further proceedings\n\nnotwithstanding their failure to meet the technical jurisdictional\n\nrequirements.\n\n     We first address the Tax Court’s jurisdictional ruling and\n\nthen explain why that decision is also correct as a matter of\n\nsubstantive law.\n\n                                  II. Discussion\n\n     A. Jurisdiction\n\n     The Boyds complain that the Tax Court’s dismissal of their\n\ncase based on the lack of a “determination” by an IRS appeals\n\nofficer turns the statutory right to due process on its head in\n\ncases       where,   as   here,   the   taxpayers’   claim   is   that   the   IRS\n\nimproperly denied them the process that would have led to a\n\ndetermination – and thus to subject matter jurisdiction in the Tax\n\nCourt.        It cannot be, they assert, that the IRS               may negate\n\nCongress’s grant of jurisdiction by withholding the very process\n\n\n        2\n       In his brief, Kenneth Boyd acknowledges that, technically,\nhis appeal should be heard by the district court because of the\ntype of tax involved, but he seeks a remand to the Tax Court for\nsuch a determination, which would give him thirty days to file his\nappeal with “the correct court.” See 26 § 6330(d)(1) (providing\nthat an appeal from a notice of determination is to the Tax Court,\nunless the Tax Court “does not have jurisdiction of the underlying\ntax liability,” in which case the appeal is to a federal district\ncourt).\n\n                                         -5-\n\fthat is designed to give taxpayers fair opportunity to challenge\n\nthe agency’s decision-making. Consequently, they maintain that the\n\nTax Court must have jurisdiction to consider their claim.\n\n     While this argument has equitable appeal, the Boyds offer us\n\nno authority for equitably expanding the Tax Court’s jurisdiction.\n\nIndeed, the law seems to be to the contrary.   See, e.g., Comm’r v.\n\nMcCoy, 484 U.S. 3, 7 (1987) (per curiam) (“The Tax Court is a court\n\nof limited jurisdiction and lacks general equitable powers.”);\n\nBokum v. Comm’r, 992 F.2d 1136, 1140 (11th Cir. 1993) (“[T]he Tax\n\nCourt has no equitable power to expand its statutorily prescribed\n\njurisdiction.”); Offiler v. Comm’r, 114 T.C. 492, 498 (2000) (“This\n\nCourt’s jurisdiction under section 6330(d) is dependent on the\n\nissuance of a valid notice of determination and a timely petition\n\nfor review.”); cf. Meadows v. Comm’r, 405 F.3d 949, 953 (11th Cir.\n\n2005) (per curiam) (“[I]t is unclear whether or not the Tax Court\n\nhas . . . equitable power” to “expand its statutorily prescribed\n\njurisdiction.”).\n\n     The Boyds’ assertion that jurisdiction must exist in the Tax\n\nCourt as part of the section 6330 scheme would be more persuasive\n\nif the IRS’s conduct here were otherwise unreviewable.   The Boyds\n\nwere not, however, without a remedy.   As the government suggested\n\nat oral argument, the Boyds could have sought a refund of their\n\noverpayment in district court based on their contention that the\n\nIRS seized the funds improperly when it failed to utilize the\n\n\n                               -6-\n\frequisite levy procedures.       See 28 U.S.C. § 1346(a) (“[D]istrict\n\ncourts shall have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the United\n\nStates Court of Federal Claims, of: (1) Any civil action against\n\nthe United States for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax\n\nalleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected\n\n. . . .”); 26 U.S.C. § 7422(d) (“The credit of an overpayment of\n\nany tax in satisfaction of any tax liability shall, for the purpose\n\nof any suit for refund of such tax liability so satisfied, be\n\ndeemed to be a payment in respect of such tax liability . . . .”).\n\nIf the Boyds had succeeded with such a claim and secured the right\n\nto a refund, the IRS would then presumably have had the option to\n\nagain seek an offset – but only by following the statutory levy\n\nprocedures.\n\n     We recognize that such a multi-step process is imperfect and\n\ninconvenient, and it would be troubling when imposed on taxpayers\n\nwith strong claims of entitlement to the pre-seizure procedural\n\nprotections Congress sought to provide through section 6330.\n\nThis,   however,   is   not   such   a   case.     As   we   explain   below,\n\nexamination of the merits of the Boyds’ argument leads to the same\n\njurisdictional outcome.       While our previous discussion arguably is\n\nsufficient to resolve the case, we think it advisable to address\n\nalternatively   the     post-1998    status   of   offsets   to   dispel   any\n\ninference of “arbitrary administrative action” that might favor a\n\ndifferent outcome.      Cf. Robinson v. United States, 920 F.2d 1157,\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f1161 (3d Cir. 1990) (allowing suit to proceed in Tax Court, even\n\nthough IRS failed to send out prerequisite notice of deficiency, to\n\n“preserve[] the options granted to the taxpayers and [to] grant[]\n\nthem the means, perhaps not otherwise available, to correct an\n\narbitrary administrative action”).\n\n     B. Offset vs. Levy\n\n     The    parties   appear   to   agree   that,   before   the   Tax   Code\n\nrevisions of 1998, the IRS generally had the authority, under 26\n\nU.S.C. § 6402,3 to offset a taxpayer’s outstanding tax liability\n\nwith any subsequent overpayment owed to the taxpayer, and that the\n\nIRS was not expected to obtain a formal levy in order to do so.4\n\nSection 6402 requires neither notice nor a hearing – nor any other\n\nprocedural prerequisite – for effecting an offset.\n\n\n\n     3\n         Section 6402(a) provides, in pertinent part:\n\n     In the case of any overpayment, the Secretary . . . may\n     credit the amount of such overpayment . . . against any\n     liability in respect of an internal revenue tax on the\n     part of the person who made the overpayment . . . .\n     4\n       The Boyds do maintain, however, that the validity of the\noffset in this case, even pre-1998, would have been questionable\nbecause of two distinguishing factors: first, the overpayment was\njointly owed to Kenneth and Marie but the earlier liability was\nKenneth’s alone; and second, Kenneth had arranged to pay his\nearlier debt through an installment plan.       Neither of these,\nhowever, would have affected the offset of Kenneth’s portion of the\noverpayment.   Although the Commissioner usually is barred from\nlevying when an installment agreement is in effect, that\nprohibition does not apply to offsets under section 6402. See 26\nU.S.C. § 6331(k)(3)(A). The IRS acknowledged that Marie’s pro-rata\nshare of the overpayment should not have been seized and refunded\nit during the administrative process.\n\n                                    -8-\n\f     By contrast, as we have noted, the statutory provisions\n\ngoverning levies require the Commissioner to give the taxpayer\n\nthirty days’ advance notice of the intent to levy, see 26 U.S.C. §\n\n6331(d),   an   opportunity   for   a   hearing   before   an   IRS   appeals\n\nofficer, id. §§ 6330(a) & (b), and a decision – or “determination”\n\n– following such a hearing that may be appealed within thirty days\n\nto either the Tax Court or a district court, depending upon the\n\ntype of tax at issue,    id. §§ 6330(c) & (d).\n\n     Although the notice requirement has been in place for some\n\ntime, section 6330's hearing and appeals procedures were added to\n\nthe Tax Code as part of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring\n\nand Reform Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-206, § 3401, 112 Stat. 685.\n\nSection 6331 also was revised at that time, and the Boyds cite one\n\nparticular change in that provision to support their contention\n\nthat the Act eliminated the procedural differences between offsets\n\nand levies and requires that offsets by effectuated by means of the\n\nlevy procedures.\n\n     The provision on which they rely, § 6331(i)(3)(B)(i), provides\n\nan exception to the prohibition against imposing a levy when\n\nproceedings are pending for the refund of “divisible” taxes, which\n\ninclude employment taxes; it states that the prohibition does not\n\napply to “any levy to carry out an offset under section 6402.”5\n\n\n\n     5\n       Section 6331(k)(3)(A) contains a similar prohibition and\nexception that applies when an installment plan is in effect.\n\n                                    -9-\n\fThe Boyds argue that this phrase signals that a levy is now a\n\nprocedural prerequisite for an offset.\n\n          The Boyds have read far too much into the language of §\n\n6331(i)(3)(B)(i).         The language does not state that an offset must\n\nbe effected by means of a levy, and nowhere in the statutory\n\namendments did Congress indicate an intention to erase the long-\n\nstanding distinction between the informal offset and the more\n\nregulated levy by requiring that offsets now all be accomplished by\n\nmeans of the levy procedures.               We think it unimaginable that\n\nCongress would have made such a significant change offhandedly in\n\nthe       provision     governing   levy    procedures    without     explicitly\n\nrecognizing that change in § 6402 – the provision that directly\n\naddresses the IRS’s authority to credit overpayments against prior\n\ntax liabilities.         Moreover, § 6331(i)(3)(B)(i) is an exception to\n\na prohibition against imposing levies in particular circumstances,\n\ndistinguishing a “levy to carry out an offset” as warranting less\n\nprotection than the standard levy.              Given the absence of language\n\nin    §    6402   and   the   limiting   role    it   plays   in   section   6331,\n\nsubsection (i)(3)(B)(i) simply cannot bear the weight the Boyds\n\nassign to it.\n\n          Indeed, in context, Congress’s attention to the status of a\n\n“levy to effect an offset” is fully consistent with an intent to\n\nreinforce the differences between the two types of collection\n\nactions. The government’s attorney at oral argument confirmed what\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\four case law also reveals – that offsets are at times effected by\n\nmeans of the more protective levy procedures even though the law\n\ndoes not require such precautions.\n\n     In P.J. Keating Co., 805 F.2d at 452, we accepted as a\n\n“truism” that “the IRS often proceeds against [property in the\n\nhands of a government agency] by serving a formal notice of levy\n\nupon the other agency,” and ruled that “the action of the IRS in\n\nserving a notice of levy upon another federal agency does not\n\nmagically transform a traditional set off by the federal government\n\ninto a levy.”    See also United Sand and Gravel Contractors, Inc. v.\n\nUnited States, 624 F.2d 733, 736 (5th Cir. 1980) (“[I]t has been an\n\nestablished practice of the I.R.S., recognized by the courts, to\n\nproceed against property in the hands of other federal agencies by\n\na formal levy rather than by set off.”).6        With that background in\n\nmind,    §   6331(i)(3)(B)(i)   is     most   reasonably   understood   as\n\nCongress’s attempt to ensure that traditional offset actions remain\n\n\n\n     6\n      In United Sand and Gravel, the Fifth Circuit concluded that,\nin a case where the IRS served a formal notice of levy on funds\nowed to a taxpayer by the United States Corps of Army Engineers,\nthe statutory levy scheme was applicable; the court noted that\nsection 6331(a) “contains no implied exclusion for property in the\nhands of a federal agency.” See 624 F.2d at 737. We disagreed\nwith this conclusion in P.J. Keating, stating that “a government\nagency’s transfer to the IRS of funds owed to a delinquent taxpayer\nshould properly be characterized as a set off by the federal\ngovernment even if the transfer occurs pursuant to a formal notice\nof levy.” See 805 F.2d at 452-53. Thus, we ruled, “no cause of\naction for wrongful levy exists when the United States simply sets\noff an amount owed to a taxpayer against that taxpayer’s accrued\nliability.” Id. at 453.\n\n                                     -11-\n\fdistinct – even when accomplished by means of a levy – and are not\n\ngenerally subject to the new procedural protections for levies.\n\nThe Tax Court adhered to that distinction in Bullock v. Comm’r, 85\n\nT.C.M. (CCH) 737 (2003), 2003 WL 43374 (U.S. Tax Ct.), holding that\n\nthe Commissioner’s authority under section 6402 to credit an\n\noverpayment to offset the taxpayer’s liability for another taxable\n\nyear is not a levy action subject to section 6330.\n\n     In sum, we are unpersuaded that the procedural differences\n\nbetween levy and offset have been eliminated, and the Tax Court’s\n\njurisdictional ruling thus had no adverse impact on the Boyds’\n\nsubstantive rights.\n\n     Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -12-\n\f",

The IRS Office of Appeals rejected his request, stating that a \"[r]efund offset[]\" is not considered a collection action subject to the procedural protections Boyd claimed the agency had violated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Boyds next took their complaint to the Tax Court, arguing that a provision added to the Tax Code in 1998 manifested Congress's intent that offsets be effected by means of a formal \"levy\" and that, therefore, they were wrongly denied the notice and opportunity for a hearing specified for levies in 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6330. They invoked jurisdiction under section 6330(d), which gives the Tax Court authority to review a \"determination\" made by the IRS Office of Appeals following a hearing on a taxpayer's challenge to an impending levy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Tax Court declined to address the merits of the Boyds' claim&#8212;i.e., whether offsets are subject to levy procedures&#8212;on the ground that it lacked jurisdiction. <i>See Boyd v. Comm'r,</i> 124 T.C. 296, 302-03, 2005 WL 1503680 (2005). The court ruled that, under &#167; 6330, its jurisdiction was limited to instances in which taxpayers obtain the written \"notice of determination\" that is issued by the Appeals Office following a hearing. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6330(d); <i>Greene-Thapedi v. Comm'r,</i> 126 T.C. 1, 2006 WL 83125 (2006); <i>Lunsford v. Comm'r,</i> 117 T.C. 159, 161, 164, 2001 WL 1521578 (2001).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> No such ruling had been issued, of course, because the Boyds had not been offered the opportunity for a hearing. The Tax Court further stated that it would lack jurisdiction even if it treated the offset notice that the Boyds <i>did</i> receive as a notice of determination because a Tax Court appeal must be filed within 30 days of the notice, and the Boyds filed their action beyond that date. <i>See</i> 124 T.C. at 303.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Boyds then appealed to this court, renewing their substantive argument that the 1998 revisions to the Tax Code required the IRS to treat the disputed offset as subject to the levy procedural requirements. They claim they are entitled to either an order directing the Secretary of the Treasury to issue a notice of determination, allowing them to meet the jurisdictional requirements of the Tax Court and thus to challenge the offset in that venue,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> or a remand to the Tax Court for further proceedings notwithstanding their failure to meet the technical jurisdictional requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address the Tax Court's jurisdictional ruling and then explain why that decision is also correct as a matter of substantive law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Jurisdiction</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Boyds complain that the Tax Court's dismissal of their case based on the lack of a \"determination\" by an IRS appeals officer turns the statutory right to due process on its head in cases where, as here, the taxpayers' claim is that the IRS improperly denied them the process that would have led to a determination&#8212;and thus to subject matter jurisdiction in the Tax Court. It cannot be, they assert, that the IRS may negate Congress's grant of jurisdiction by withholding the very process that is designed to give taxpayers fair opportunity to challenge the agency's decision-making. Consequently, they maintain that the Tax Court must have jurisdiction to consider their claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this argument has equitable appeal, the Boyds offer us no authority for equitably expanding the Tax Court's jurisdiction. Indeed, the law seems to be to the contrary. <i>See, e.g., Comm'r v. McCoy,</i> 484 U.S. 3, 7, 108 S.Ct. 217, 98 L.Ed.2d 2 (1987) (per curiam) (\"The Tax Court is a court of limited jurisdiction and lacks general equitable powers.\"); <i>Bokum v. Comm'r,</i> 992 F.2d 1136, 1140 (11th Cir. 1993) (\"[T]he Tax Court has no equitable power to expand its statutorily prescribed jurisdiction.\"); <i>Offiler v. Comm'r,</i> 114 T.C. 492, 498, 2000 WL 777218 (2000) (\"This Court's jurisdiction under section 6330(d) is dependent on the issuance of a valid notice of determination and a timely petition for review.\"); <i>cf. Meadows v. Comm'r,</i> 405 F.3d 949, 953 (11th Cir.2005) (per curiam) (\"[I]t is unclear whether or not the Tax Court has ... equitable power\" to \"expand its statutorily prescribed jurisdiction.\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Boyds' assertion that jurisdiction must exist in the Tax Court as part of the section 6330 scheme would be more persuasive if the IRS's conduct here were otherwise unreviewable. The Boyds were not, however, without a remedy. As the government suggested at oral argument, the Boyds could have sought a refund of their overpayment in district court based on their contention that the IRS seized the funds improperly when it failed to utilize the requisite levy procedures. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(a) (\"[D]istrict courts shall have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the United States Court of Federal Claims, of: (1) Any civil action against the United States for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected....\"); 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7422(d) (\"The credit of an overpayment of any tax in satisfaction of any tax liability shall, for the purpose of any suit for refund of such tax liability so satisfied, be deemed to be a payment in respect of such tax liability....\"). If the Boyds had succeeded with such a claim and secured the right to a refund, the IRS would then presumably have had the option to again seek an offset&#8212;but only by following the statutory levy procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that such a multi-step process is imperfect and inconvenient, and it would be troubling when imposed on taxpayers with strong claims of entitlement to the <i>pre-seizure</i> procedural protections Congress sought to provide through section 6330. This, however, is not such a case. As we explain below, examination of the merits of the Boyds' argument leads to the same jurisdictional outcome. While our previous discussion arguably is sufficient to resolve the case, we think it advisable to address alternatively the post-1998 status of offsets to dispel any inference of \"arbitrary administrative action\" that might favor a different outcome. <i>Cf. Robinson v. United States,</i> 920 F.2d 1157, 1161 (3d Cir.1990) (allowing suit to proceed in Tax Court, even though IRS failed to send out prerequisite notice of deficiency, to \"preserve[] the options granted to the taxpayers and [to] grant[] them the means, perhaps not otherwise available, to correct an arbitrary administrative action\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Offset v. Levy</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties appear to agree that, before the Tax Code revisions of 1998, the IRS generally had the authority, under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6402,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> to offset a taxpayer's out-standing tax liability with any subsequent overpayment owed to the taxpayer, and that the IRS was not expected to obtain a formal levy in order to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Section 6402 requires neither notice nor a hearing&#8212;nor any other procedural prerequisite&#8212;for effecting an offset.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, as we have noted, the statutory provisions governing levies require the Commissioner to give the taxpayer thirty days' advance notice of the intent to levy, <i>see</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6331(d), an opportunity for a hearing before an IRS appeals officer, <i>id.</i> &#167;&#167; 6330(a) &amp; (b), and a decision&#8212;or \"determination\"&#8212;following such a hearing that may be appealed within thirty days to either the Tax Court or a district court, depending upon the type of tax at issue, <i>id.</i> &#167;&#167; 6330(c) &amp; (d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the notice requirement has been in place for some time, section 6330's hearing and appeals procedures were added to the Tax Code as part of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, Pub.L. No. 105-206, &#167; 3401, 112 Stat. 685. Section 6331 also was revised at that time, and the Boyds cite one particular change in that provision to support their contention that the Act eliminated the procedural differences between offsets and levies and requires that offsets by effectuated by means of the levy procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provision on which they rely, &#167; 6331(i)(3)(B)(i), provides an exception to the prohibition against imposing a levy when proceedings are pending for the refund of \"divisible\" taxes, which include employment taxes; it states that the prohibition does not apply to \"any levy to carry out an offset under section 6402.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The Boyds argue that this phrase signals that a levy is now a procedural prerequisite for an offset.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Boyds have read far too much into the language of &#167; 6331(i)(3)(B)(i). The language does not state that an offset <i>must</i> be effected by means of a levy, and nowhere in the statutory amendments did Congress indicate an intention to erase the long-standing distinction between the informal offset and the more regulated levy by requiring that offsets now all be accomplished by means of the levy procedures. We think it unimaginable that Congress would have made such a significant change offhandedly in the provision governing levy procedures without explicitly recognizing that change in &#167; 6402&#8212;the provision that directly addresses the IRS's authority to credit overpayments against prior tax liabilities. Moreover, &#167; 6331(i)(3)(B)(i) is an <i>exception</i> to a prohibition against imposing levies in particular circumstances, distinguishing a \"levy to carry out an offset\" as warranting less protection than the standard levy. Given the absence of language in &#167; 6402 and the limiting role it plays in section 6331, subsection (i)(3)(B)(i) simply cannot bear the weight the Boyds assign to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, in context, Congress's attention to the status of a \"levy to effect an offset\" is fully consistent with an intent to reinforce the differences between the two types of collection actions. The government's attorney at oral argument confirmed what our case law also reveals&#8212; that offsets are at times effected by means of the more protective levy procedures even though the law does not require such precautions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>P.J. Keating Co.,</i> 805 F.2d at 452, we accepted as a \"truism\" that \"the IRS often proceeds against [property in the hands of a government agency] by serving a formal notice of levy upon the other agency,\" and ruled that \"the action of the IRS in serving a notice of levy upon another federal agency does not magically transform a traditional set off by the federal government into a levy.\" <i>See also United Sand and Gravel Contractors, Inc. v. United States,</i> 624 F.2d 733, 736 (5th Cir.1980) (\"[I]t has been an established practice of the I.R.S., recognized by the courts, to proceed against property in the hands of other federal agencies by a formal levy rather than by set off.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> With that background in mind, &#167; 6331(i)(3)(B)(i) is most reasonably understood as Congress's attempt to ensure that traditional offset actions remain distinct&#8212;even when accomplished by means of a levy&#8212;and are <i>not</i> generally subject to the new procedural protections for levies. The Tax Court adhered to that distinction in <i>Bullock v. Comm'r,</i> 85 T.C.M. (CCH) 737 (2003), 2003 WL 43374 (U.S.Tax Ct.), holding that the Commissioner's authority under section 6402 to credit an overpayment to offset the taxpayer's liability for another taxable year is not a levy action subject to section 6330.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, we are unpersuaded that the procedural differences between levy and offset have been eliminated, and the Tax Court's jurisdictional ruling thus had no adverse impact on the Boyds' substantive rights.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In an unpublished opinion, this court has upheld the Tax Court's conclusion that \"its jurisdiction under &#167; 6330(d) depends upon the issuance of a valid notice of determination by the IRS's Office of Appeals and the filing of a timely petition for review.\"<i>See Rudd v.

Neither of these, however, would have affected the offset of Kenneth's portion of the overpayment. Although the Commissioner usually is barred from levying when an installment agreement is in effect, that prohibition does not apply to offsets under section 6402<i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6331(k)(3)(A).

We disagreed with this conclusion in <i>P.J.

They claim they are entitled to either an order directing the Secretary of the Treasury to issue a notice of determination, allowing them to meet the jurisdictional requirements of the Tax Court and thus to challenge the offset in that venue,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> or a remand to the Tax Court for further proceedings notwithstanding their failure to meet the technical jurisdictional requirements.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We first address the Tax Court's jurisdictional ruling and then explain why that decision is also correct as a matter of substantive law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">II. <i>Discussion</i></p>\n    <p class=\"indent\">A. <i>Jurisdiction</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Boyds complain that the Tax Court's dismissal of their case based on the lack of a \"determination\" by an IRS appeals officer turns the statutory right to due process on its head in cases where, as here, the taxpayers' claim is that the IRS improperly denied them the process that would have led to a determination&#8212;and thus to subject matter jurisdiction in the Tax Court. It cannot be, they assert, that the IRS may negate Congress's grant of jurisdiction by withholding the very process that is designed to give taxpayers fair opportunity to challenge the agency's decision-making. Consequently, they maintain that the Tax Court must have jurisdiction to consider their claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">While this argument has equitable appeal, the Boyds offer us no authority for equitably expanding the Tax Court's jurisdiction. Indeed, the law seems to be to the contrary. <i>See, e.g., Comm'r v.

The Boyds were not, however, without a remedy. As the government suggested at oral argument, the Boyds could have sought a refund of their overpayment in district court based on their contention that the IRS seized the funds improperly when it failed to utilize the requisite levy procedures. <i>See</i> 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1346(a) (\"[D]istrict courts shall have original jurisdiction, concurrent with the United States Court of Federal Claims, of: (1) Any civil action against the United States for the recovery of any internal-revenue tax alleged to have been erroneously or illegally assessed or collected....\"); 26 U.S.C. &#167; 7422(d) (\"The credit of an overpayment of any tax in satisfaction of any tax liability shall, for the purpose of any suit for refund of such tax liability so satisfied, be deemed to be a payment in respect of such tax liability....\"). If the Boyds had succeeded with such a claim and secured the right to a refund, the IRS would then presumably have had the option to again seek an offset&#8212;but only by following the statutory levy procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We recognize that such a multi-step process is imperfect and inconvenient, and it would be troubling when imposed on taxpayers with strong claims of entitlement to the <i>pre-seizure</i> procedural protections Congress sought to provide through section 6330. This, however, is not such a case. As we explain below, examination of the merits of the Boyds' argument leads to the same jurisdictional outcome. While our previous discussion arguably is sufficient to resolve the case, we think it advisable to address alternatively the post-1998 status of offsets to dispel any inference of \"arbitrary administrative action\" that might favor a different outcome. <i>Cf. Robinson v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552783\"><a href=\"/opinion/552783/albert-e-robinson-and-rose-m-robinson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1157</span></a></span>, 1161 (3d Cir.1990) (allowing suit to proceed in Tax Court, even though IRS failed to send out prerequisite notice of deficiency, to \"preserve[] the options granted to the taxpayers and [to] grant[] them the means, perhaps not otherwise available, to correct an arbitrary administrative action\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Offset v. Levy</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The parties appear to agree that, before the Tax Code revisions of 1998, the IRS generally had the authority, under 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6402,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> to offset a taxpayer's out-standing tax liability with any subsequent overpayment owed to the taxpayer, and that the IRS was not expected to obtain a formal levy in order to do so.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> Section 6402 requires neither notice nor a hearing&#8212;nor any other procedural prerequisite&#8212;for effecting an offset.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By contrast, as we have noted, the statutory provisions governing levies require the Commissioner to give the taxpayer thirty days' advance notice of the intent to levy, <i>see</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6331(d), an opportunity for a hearing before an IRS appeals officer, <i>id.</i> &#167;&#167; 6330(a) &amp; (b), and a decision&#8212;or \"determination\"&#8212;following such a hearing that may be appealed within thirty days to either the Tax Court or a district court, depending upon the type of tax at issue, <i>id.</i> &#167;&#167; 6330(c) &amp; (d).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the notice requirement has been in place for some time, section 6330's hearing and appeals procedures were added to the Tax Code as part of the Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Reform Act of 1998, Pub.L. No. 105-206, &#167; 3401, 112 Stat. 685. Section 6331 also was revised at that time, and the Boyds cite one particular change in that provision to support their contention that the Act eliminated the procedural differences between offsets and levies and requires that offsets by effectuated by means of the levy procedures.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The provision on which they rely, &#167; 6331(i)(3)(B)(i), provides an exception to the prohibition against imposing a levy when proceedings are pending for the refund of \"divisible\" taxes, which include employment taxes; it states that the prohibition does not apply to \"any levy to carry out an offset under section 6402.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The Boyds argue that this phrase signals that a levy is now a procedural prerequisite for an offset.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Boyds have read far too much into the language of &#167; 6331(i)(3)(B)(i). The language does not state that an offset <i>must</i> be effected by means of a levy, and nowhere in the statutory amendments did Congress indicate an intention to erase the long-standing distinction between the informal offset and the more regulated levy by requiring that offsets now all be accomplished by means of the levy procedures. We think it unimaginable that Congress would have made such a significant change offhandedly in the provision governing levy procedures without explicitly recognizing that change in &#167; 6402&#8212;the provision that directly addresses the IRS's authority to credit overpayments against prior tax liabilities. Moreover, &#167; 6331(i)(3)(B)(i) is an <i>exception</i> to a prohibition against imposing levies in particular circumstances, distinguishing a \"levy to carry out an offset\" as warranting less protection than the standard levy. Given the absence of language in &#167; 6402 and the limiting role it plays in section 6331, subsection (i)(3)(B)(i) simply cannot bear the weight the Boyds assign to it.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Indeed, in context, Congress's attention to the status of a \"levy to effect an offset\" is fully consistent with an intent to reinforce the differences between the two types of collection actions. The government's attorney at oral argument confirmed what our case law also reveals&#8212; that offsets are at times effected by means of the more protective levy procedures even though the law does not require such precautions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In <i>P.J. Keating Co.,</i> 805 F.2d at 452, we accepted as a \"truism\" that \"the IRS often proceeds against [property in the hands of a government agency] by serving a formal notice of levy upon the other agency,\" and ruled that \"the action of the IRS in serving a notice of levy upon another federal agency does not magically transform a traditional set off by the federal government into a levy.\" <i>See also United Sand and Gravel Contractors, Inc. v. United States,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"379540\"><a href=\"/opinion/379540/united-sand-and-gravel-contractors-inc-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">624</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">733</span></a></span>, 736 (5th Cir.1980) (\"[I]t has been an established practice of the I.R.S., recognized by the courts, to proceed against property in the hands of other federal agencies by a formal levy rather than by set off.\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> With that background in mind, &#167; 6331(i)(3)(B)(i) is most reasonably understood as Congress's attempt to ensure that traditional offset actions remain distinct&#8212;even when accomplished by means of a levy&#8212;and are <i>not</i> generally subject to the new procedural protections for levies.

Neither of these, however, would have affected the offset of Kenneth's portion of the overpayment. Although the Commissioner usually is barred from levying when an installment agreement is in effect, that prohibition does not apply to offsets under section 6402<i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. &#167; 6331(k)(3)(A). The IRS acknowledged that Marie's pro-rata share of the overpayment should not have been seized and refunded it during the administrative process.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Section 6331(k)(3)(A) contains a similar prohibition and exception that applies when an installment plan is in effect</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In<i>United Sand and Gravel,</i> the Fifth Circuit concluded that, in a case where the IRS served a formal notice of levy on funds owed to a taxpayer by the United States Corps of Army Engineers, the statutory levy scheme was applicable; the court noted that section 6331(a) \"contains no implied exclusion for property in the hands of a federal agency.\" <i>See</i> 624 F.2d at 737. We disagreed with this conclusion in <i>P.J. Keating,</i> stating that \"a government agency's transfer to the IRS of funds owed to a delinquent taxpayer should properly be characterized as a set off by the federal government even if the transfer occurs pursuant to a formal notice of levy.\" <i>See</i> 805 F.2d at 452-53. Thus, we ruled, \"no cause of action for wrongful levy exists when the United States simply sets off an amount owed to a taxpayer against that taxpayer's accrued liability.\" <i>Id.</i> at 453.</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",
