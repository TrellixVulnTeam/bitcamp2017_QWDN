Alma Pula (\"Pula\"), her husband, and their\n\ntwo children, all of whom are natives and citizens of Albania,\n\npetition for review of a decision of the Board of Immigration\n\nAppeals (\"BIA\"), dismissing their appeal from a decision of an\n\nimmigration    judge    (\"IJ\")     denying   their    claims   for    asylum,\n\nwithholding of removal, and relief under the Convention Against\n\nTorture (\"CAT\").\n\n            The undisputed facts are essentially as follows:               Pula\n\nand her family are well-known anti-communists and supporters of the\n\nDemocratic Party.      When she left Albania, the Socialist Party was\n\nin power.    For some time before that, she had been serving as the\n\nVice Director of the Higher School of Nursing.           The Director, who\n\nwas a doctor and member of the Socialist Party, resented her\n\nbecause she was a woman and a nurse, had strong connections with\n\nforeign funding sources, had instituted various reforms at the\n\nschool   giving    nurses   more    teaching   responsibility,       and    had\n\ncomplained that students were being sexually harassed and extorted\n\nfor money by doctors on the faculty.                 In response to        those\n\ncomplaints, the Director said, \"[T]he Jaranis [Pula's family] are\n\nalways troublemakers[;] . . . they think they are so perfect . . .\n\n[W]ho cares about your democratic little ideas.\"\n\n            After Pula learned that her position was being advertised\n\nwith enhanced qualifications that only a doctor could satisfy and\n\nthat the position was likely to be filled by a doctor with\n\n                                     -2-\n\fSocialist   Party    connections,   she   confronted   the   Director   and\n\nthreatened to expose the corruption and sexual harassment at the\n\nschool. Two days later, when she was walking home from the school,\n\nshe was accosted by an unknown man (whom she thought was a member\n\nof the Albanian secret police because of the way he was dressed),\n\nwho called her a \"bitch of Sali Berisha,\" the leader of the\n\nDemocratic Party; grabbed her by the hair; and told her to shut up\n\nor he would make her shut up, which she took as a death threat.\n\nWhen she arrived home, she found that her two young sons had\n\ndisappeared.     When the boys returned unharmed a few hours later,\n\nthey reported that a man who said that he was a friend of hers took\n\nthem for a ride, bought them ice cream, and told them to tell their\n\nmother to take better care of them in the future.            Shaken up by\n\nthose two events, which she thought were connected, she consulted\n\na family friend who advised her to stay indoors and ultimately to\n\nleave Albania.      She took his advice, and she and her sons left a\n\nmonth later to join her husband, who was already in the United\n\nStates visiting relatives.\n\n            In finding Pula and her family ineligible for asylum, the\n\nBIA correctly determined that Pula's alleged mistreatment, while\n\nundoubtedly frightening, did not rise to the level of \"persecution\"\n\nfor purposes of eligibility for asylum or withholding of removal.\n\nSee, e.g., Alibeaj v. Gonzales, 469 F.3d 188, 189-90 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (concluding that death threats, beating, and misappropriation\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fof property, without any permanent or serious physical injuries,\n\nwere \"plainly insufficient to compel a finding of persecution\").\n\nThe BIA also permissibly rejected Pula's claim that those events\n\nwere on account of her political beliefs.         See Ziu v. Gonzales, 412\n\nF.3d 202, 204-05 (1st Cir. 2005) (holding that \"IJ was free to\n\nreject such speculation as to motive even while generally finding\n\npetitioner credible as to historical facts\").                The timing of the\n\nalleged incidents--just two days after Pula had threatened to\n\nexpose corruption in the nursing school's handling of donated\n\nfunds--is a strong indication that those incidents were motivated\n\nby a desire to silence such exposure rather than by Pula's long-\n\nstanding   political    affiliation      or   beliefs.       As   Pula    herself\n\ntestified, coming between embezzlers and their funding sources\n\ncould well place her in danger.                  Finally, the BIA also\n\nsupportably determined that Pula had failed to show that the\n\nunidentified men who assaulted and threatened her and abducted her\n\nsons were connected with the Albanian government.                 Her testimony\n\nthat the assault occurred near the headquarters of the secret\n\npolice   and   that    the   assaulter    resembled      a    member     of   that\n\norganization because he was wearing a light gray business suit\n\ncertainly does not compel a finding of a government connection.\n\nSee generally Attia v. Gonzales, 477 F.3d 21, 13 (1st Cir. 2007)\n\n(stating applicable standard of judicial review).              She provided no\n\n\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fevidence at all that the abductor of her children was a government\n\nagent.\n\n             Absent past persecution on a protected ground, the IJ\n\ncorrectly placed the burden on Pula to prove that she had a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution, Orelien v. Gonzales, 467 F.3d\n\n67, 72 (1st Cir. 2006), and concluded that she had failed to do so.\n\nAlthough neither the IJ nor the BIA explained their reasoning on\n\nthis point, \"the agency's path may reasonably be discerned\" from\n\nthe record.     Tota v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 161, 166 n.9 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Sulaiman v.\n\nGonzáles, 429 F.3d 347, 350 (1st Cir. 2005) (declining to remand\n\nfor an express finding on past persecution where agency's reasoning\n\nwas sufficiently clear from the record to permit judicial review).\n\nLike   her   claim   of   past   persecution,   Pula's   fear   of   future\n\npersecution was premised on the scenario that if forced to return\n\nto Albania, she would expose corruption at the nursing school and\n\nwould be persecuted on that ground.       The determination that Pula's\n\nalleged past persecution on that ground was not on account of her\n\npolitical beliefs applies equally well to her fear of future\n\npersecution on that same ground.\n\n             The fact that the IJ's and BIA's decisions did not\n\nexpressly mention some evidence in Pula's favor--including the\n\ndeclaration and testimony of Bernd Fischer, a professor of Balkan\n\nhistory, who opined that Pula had reason to fear persecution by the\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fSocialist Party government--is inconsequential.        \"[E]ach piece of\n\nevidence need not be discussed in a decision.\"      Morales v. INS, 208\n\nF.3d 323, 328 (1st Cir. 2000).       Rather, \"'in the absence of clear\n\nevidence to the contrary, [we] presume that [the IJ and BIA] have\n\nproperly discharged their official duties.'\" Tota, 457 F.3d at 168\n\n(citation   omitted).    No   such    contrary   evidence   exists   here.\n\nIndeed, in the course of the hearing, the IJ expressly stated that\n\nhe had reviewed the documentary evidence, including Professor\n\nFischer's declaration, before the hearing, and the IJ also allowed\n\nDr. Fischer to testify by telephone even though his declaration was\n\nalready in evidence.\n\n            Moreover, a review of the record in its entirety does not\n\ncompel a contrary conclusion. Even Dr. Fischer's opinion that Pula\n\nhad grounds to fear persecution by the Socialist Party government\n\nwas qualified. And the recent reports of country conditions in the\n\nrecord indicate that politically related violence by the Socialist\n\nParty government against Democratic Party supporters had abated by\n\nthe time of the hearing before the IJ.      See also Tota, 457 F.3d at\n\n166-67; Alibeaj, 469 F.3d at 193.\n\n            Having properly found Pula and her family ineligible for\n\nasylum, the BIA also correctly concluded that they could not meet\n\nthe higher standard for withholding of removal.       Orelien, 467 F.3d\n\nat 73.   Its determination that the Pulas were not eligible for CAT\n\nrelief was also legally correct and supported by the record.           As\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fthe IJ and BIA concluded, Pula presented no evidence that she would\n\nlikely be \"tortured\" upon returning to Algeria, as that term is\n\nnarrowly defined in the applicable regulations.   See id. (citing 8\n\nC.F.R. § 208.18(a)(1)).\n\n          In sum, we find the BIA's decision to be free of legal\n\nerror and supported by substantial evidence in the record as a\n\nwhole.   Accordingly, we affirm the BIA's decision and deny the\n\npetition for review.   See 1st Cir. R. 27.0(c).\n\n\n\n\n                                -7-\n\f",
