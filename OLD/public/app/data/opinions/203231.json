Cyr participated in the original\nhearing and disposition of this case but retired prior to the\ndisposition of the petition for rehearing. The remaining members\nof the panel comprise a quorum for the issuance of this decision.\n28 U.S.C. § 46(d).\n\f          Per Curiam.   This case is now before us on petition for\n\nrehearing.    As recounted in detail in our prior decision, United\n\nStates v. Godin, 489 F.3d 431 (1st Cir. 2007) (\"Godin I\"), Jennifer\n\nGodin pled guilty in 2005 to one count of obstructing commerce by\n\nrobbery, 18 U.S.C. § 1951(a) (2000), and one count of using and\n\ncarrying a firearm during and in relation to the robbery, id. §\n\n924(c)(1)(A)(ii).   On April 14, 2006, the district court sentenced\n\nher to 262 months computed as follows.\n\n          Applying the 2005 sentencing guidelines, the district\n\ncourt found that Godin was a career offender because her crime was\n\na crime of violence, she was at least eighteen years old at the\n\ntime of the offense, and she had two prior offenses in that\n\ncategory (both burglaries of apartments in the same building in the\n\nsame week).   U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(a).    As a career offender convicted\n\non multiple counts, one of which was under 18 U.S.C. § 924(c), her\n\nguidelines range was 262-327 months.    U.S.S.G. § 4B1.1(c)(3).   The\n\ndistrict court chose the bottom of this range.\n\n          On appeal, Godin challenged inter alia the district\n\ncourt's determination that she was a career offender.    She argued\n\nthat her two prior crimes of violence--the burglaries--should be\n\ncounted as one because they were \"related sentences\" as defined in\n\nthe guidelines.     U.S.S.G. §§ 4B1.2(c), 4A1.2(a)(2) & cmt. n. 3\n\n(2005).   We rejected Godin's argument because the two burglaries\n\nwere not part of a \"single common scheme or plan,\" and although she\n\n\n                                -2-\n\fwas sentenced for the two burglaries on the same day, the two\n\ncrimes had not been \"consolidated for trial or sentencing,\" as this\n\ncourt had previously interpreted that phrase. Godin I, 489 F.3d at\n\n435-36.\n\n          While   Godin's    appeal       was   pending,   the   Sentencing\n\nCommission proposed an amendment to the guidelines restating the\n\nrules for determining when multiple crimes are counted as one for\n\ncriminal history purposes.     The amendment provided that two prior\n\nconvictions are counted as one if the resulting \"sentences were\n\nimposed on the same day.\" U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2(a)(2) (2007); U.S.S.G.,\n\nSupp. to App. C, Amendment 709 (2007).          The amendment, proposed in\n\nMay 2007, was set to become effective on November 1, 2007, unless\n\nCongress acted to prevent its adoption.\n\n          Under   the    proposed     amendment,      Godin's    two   prior\n\nburglaries--for which she was sentenced in state court on a single\n\nday--would count as one, and she would no longer have two prior\n\nfelony convictions.     Thus, had the amendment been in effect at the\n\ntime of her sentencing, Godin would have been excluded from the\n\ncareer offender category and her guideline sentencing range would\n\nhave been reduced from 262-327 months to a much lower number--\n\npossibly as low as 121-130 months.1\n\n\n     1\n      Godin's PSR assigned an adjusted offense level of 17 to her\nrobbery conviction. This was based on a base offense level of 20\nfor robbery under § 2B3.1, and a 3 level reduction for acceptance\nof responsibility under § 3E1.1(a).    Godin was then assigned a\ncriminal history category of IV, based on her prior convictions,\n\n                                    -3-\n\f           Following   this   court's   June   2007   affirmance   of   her\n\nsentence, Godin I, 489 F.3d at 438, Godin petitioned for rehearing,\n\nasking the court to consider the impact of the proposed amendment.\n\nAs suggested by the government, we delayed ruling on the petition\n\nto see whether the amendment would become effective on November 1,\n\n2007, as it did.   If the Sentencing Commission had also given the\n\namendment retroactive force, this would have returned the matter to\n\nthe district court, but the Commission did not do so.              United\n\nStates Sentencing Commission, Supplement to the 2007 Guidelines\n\nManual, § 1B1.10(c) (March 3, 2008) (not listing Amendment 709).\n\n           The Sentencing Commission's decision not to make the\n\namendment retroactive means the defendant is not entitled, under\n\nthe procedure set forth in 18 U.S.C. § 3582(c)(2), to further\n\nproceedings in which the district court even in the case of a\n\nsentence that has become final may choose to adjust the sentence\n\nemploying the more lenient amendment to calculate the guideline\n\nrange.   But the posture of this case is peculiar: the amendment is\n\nnot applicable retroactively, but neither has the pending appeal\n\nyet resulted in a final disposition, that is, a disposition that is\n\nno longer subject to review on direct appeal in any court.\n\n\n\nand other relevant factors under U.S.S.G. § 4A1.1, yielding a\nguideline range of 37-46 months. However, the statutory minimum\nfor the firearms offense is 84 months, running consecutively to any\nother term of imprisonment. 18 U.S.C. § 924(c)(1)(A); U.S.S.G. §\n2K2.4(b) & cmt. n. 2(A). The resulting guideline range--121-130\nmonths--would have been about half the guideline range employed.\n\n                                  -4-\n\f          Even though the case is still on appeal, neither this\n\ncourt nor the district court is governed by a non-retroactive\n\nsubstantive amendment adopted after the defendant's sentencing,2\n\nbut both we and the district court could be influenced by an\n\namendment that merely clarified an earlier provision.                   United\n\nStates v. Cabrera-Polo, 376 F.3d 29, 32 (1st Cir. 2004).               And we,\n\nalthough not the district court, could choose to alter our own\n\nprior reading of a newly clarified guideline even if in an earlier\n\ncase we had read the original guideline adversely to the defendant.\n\n          Here, the amendment is substantive and does not establish\n\nthat the pertinent guideline in effect at the time of Godin's\n\nsentence was misconstrued by this court.               See United States v.\n\nCrudup, 375 F.3d 5, 7-10 (1st Cir. 2004) (discussing factors\n\nrendering guidelines amendment either substantive or clarifying).\n\nThe   Commission    said      that   a   conflict      existed   as   to     the\n\ninterpretation     of   the    earlier     guideline     and,    in   lieu   of\n\nclarification in favor of one view or the other, it adopted a new\n\nblanket rule that eliminates the ambiguity by going beyond any\n\n\n\n\n      2\n      United States v. Havener, 905 F.2d 3, 7 (1st Cir. 1990)\n(Breyer, J.); see also United States v. Diaz-Cardenas, 351 F.3d\n404, 409 (9th Cir. 2003) (\"[S]ubstantive amendments to the\nguidelines that occur between the date of sentencing and the\nresolution of an appeal have no retroactive effect unless\nspecifically referenced in U.S.S.G. § 1B1.10.\").\n\n                                     -5-\n\fcircuit's reading of the previous rule in a manner favorable to the\n\ndefendant.3\n\n          Nevertheless, the Commission's amendment makes clear that\n\nin a case like Godin's, it regards the best approach to be to treat\n\nthe two burglary sentences imposed together as one prior sentence\n\nwithout regard to the timing or circumstances of the burglaries,\n\nand to correct any under-representation of criminal history by\n\npermitting a discretionary adjustment upward.    U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2\n\ncmt. n. 3 (2007).   Given that both of Godin's burglaries occurred\n\nwithin a short period in the same building and neither involved\n\nphysical harm to any person, it is open to doubt whether under the\n\nnew guideline the district court would have made a large upward\n\nadjustment, if any.\n\n          The Commission recognized that the language as it stood\n\nin 2005 was not crystal clear and that some circuits like ours had\n\ntaken a strict view while others had been more flexible.       The\n\nCommission could merely have \"clarified\" its preference for the\n\nflexible view and we might then have revised our own prior reading,\n\nIsabel v. United States, 980 F.2d 60, 62 (1st Cir. 1992), and given\n\n\n\n     3\n      See U.S.S.G., Supp. to App. C, Amendment 709, Reason for\nAmendment (Nov. 1, 2007) (comparing United States v. Correa, 114\nF.3d 314, 317 (1st Cir. 1997) (requiring formal order of\nconsolidation) with United States v. Huskey, 137 F.3d 283, 288 (5th\nCir. 1998) (no formal order required)). The Commission also noted\nthat practitioners complained that the earlier guideline was \"too\ncomplex and le[]d to confusion. Moreover, a significant amount of\nlitigation has arisen concerning application of the rules.\" Id.\n\n                                -6-\n\fGodin the benefit of the new rule.             Instead, the Commission made a\n\nsubstantive change, namely, to a mechanical rule that goes even\n\nfurther in the direction of leniency.                It may seem odd that in a\n\nstill pending case Godin should be irremediably worse off because\n\nthe    Commission       went     further      in    her    direction     than    mere\n\nclarification.\n\n            Understandably, the Commission hesitates to make most\n\nsubstantive changes retroactive since they may require the redoing\n\nof    hundreds    or    even   thousands      of   final    sentences.     But    the\n\nCommission's policy judgment, as we earlier conjectured in Godin I\n\nis that it is better to start low, counting the same-day sentences\n\nas one, and adjust upward if warranted.                   That does not alter the\n\nguideline range applicable in this case; but in dealing with a\n\nsentence that has not become final, it might alter the district\n\ncourt's ultimate choice of a discretionary sentence in the post-\n\nBooker era.\n\n            Thus, we think that the district judge should be given a\n\nchance to reconsider the sentence.                 The original guideline range\n\ncalculated       by    the   judge    under    the    2005    guidelines    remains\n\napplicable,       because      the   amendment      was    substantive    and    non-\n\nretroactive.      But, as the judge's discretion is no longer rigidly\n\ncontrolled by the guideline range,4 the judge is free to consider\n\n\n       4\n      Gall v. United States, 128 S. Ct. 586, 594 (2007); United\nStates v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220, 245, 259-60 (2005); United States\nv. Jimenez-Beltre, 440 F.3d 514, 518-19 (1st Cir. 2006) (en banc),\n\n                                         -7-\n\fthe Commission's current thinking for whatever use it may be in\n\nexercising the court's judgment about the proper sentence.\n\n           Admittedly, the district judge recognized the severity of\n\nthe sentence--Godin has had a \"horrendous life\" (in                the judge's\n\nwords) and suffers from mental illness--but was willing to impose\n\nit because of the nature of defendant's crime and her history of\n\ndrug abuse, crime, and violence.          Godin I, 489 F.3d at 437-38.     The\n\ndistrict court may still deem this the proper sentence.               But the\n\noriginal   guideline     range     was    the   starting    point    and   the\n\nCommission's current policy position on who should be deemed a\n\ncareer offender may have some influence on the judge's ultimate\n\ndiscretionary choice of sentence.\n\n           Accordingly, we grant the petition for rehearing, vacate\n\nour judgement of June 13, 2007, supplement Godin I with this\n\ndecision addressed to the amended guideline,           vacate the district\n\ncourt's sentence and remand for re-sentencing, leaving it to the\n\ndistrict judge to decide whether the original or some different\n\nsentence   should   be   imposed    and    to   determine   what    additional\n\nproceedings, if any, the judge might find helpful.\n\n           It is so ordered.\n\n\n\n\ncert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 928 (2007).\n\n                                     -8-\n\f",

U.S.S.G. § 4A1.2\n\ncmt. n. 3 (2007).   Given that both of Godin's burglaries occurred\n\nwithin a short period in the same building and neither involved\n\nphysical harm to any person, it is open to doubt whether under the\n\nnew guideline the district court would have made a large upward\n\nadjustment, if any.\n\n          The Commission recognized that the language as it stood\n\nin 2005 was not crystal clear and that some circuits like ours had\n\ntaken a strict view while others had been more flexible.       The\n\nCommission could merely have \"clarified\" its preference for the\n\nflexible view and we might then have revised our own prior reading,\n\nIsabel v.

Instead, the Commission made a\n\nsubstantive change, namely, to a mechanical rule that goes even\n\nfurther in the direction of leniency.                It may seem odd that in a\n\nstill pending case Godin should be irremediably worse off because\n\nthe    Commission       went     further      in    her    direction     than    mere\n\nclarification.\n\n            Understandably, the Commission hesitates to make most\n\nsubstantive changes retroactive since they may require the redoing\n\nof    hundreds    or    even   thousands      of   final    sentences.     But    the\n\nCommission's policy judgment, as we earlier conjectured in Godin I\n\nis that it is better to start low, counting the same-day sentences\n\nas one, and adjust upward if warranted.                   That does not alter the\n\nguideline range applicable in this case; but in dealing with a\n\nsentence that has not become final, it might alter the district\n\ncourt's ultimate choice of a discretionary sentence in the post-\n\nBooker era.\n\n            Thus, we think that the district judge should be given a\n\nchance to reconsider the sentence.                 The original guideline range\n\ncalculated       by    the   judge    under    the    2005    guidelines    remains\n\napplicable,       because      the   amendment      was    substantive    and    non-\n\nretroactive.      But, as the judge's discretion is no longer rigidly\n\ncontrolled by the guideline range,4 the judge is free to consider\n\n\n       4\n      Gall v.
