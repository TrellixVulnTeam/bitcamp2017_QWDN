Eleven pro se inmates appeal from the\n\ndistrict court's rejection of their challenge to a state regulation\n\nbanning   inmates'       receipt    of   publications   that     are   \"sexually\n\nexplicit\" or feature \"nudity,\" 103 C.M.R. ยง 481.15(3)(b), and to a\n\npolicy banning the display of those publications or other \"semi-\n\nnude,   scantily    clad,    and/or      sexually   suggestive    material\"   in\n\ninmates' cells, 103 DOC 400.03(2)(c)(1) & (2).                 For the reasons\n\ngiven by the district court, Moses v. Dennehy, 523 F. Supp. 2d 57\n\n(D. Mass. 2007), supplemented by the discussion below, we affirm\n\nthe district court's grant of summary judgment to the defendants.\n\nA.   Facial First Amendment Challenge to Inmate-Mail Regulation\n\n            In   rejecting    the    plaintiffs'     facial    First   Amendment\n\nchallenge   to     the   inmate-mail      regulation,   the    district    court\n\ncorrectly applied the four-part test set forth in Turner v. Safley,\n\n482 U.S. 78 (1987).         See Beard v. Banks, 548 U.S. 521, 528-29\n\n(2006) (plurality opinion);           Thornburgh v. Abbott, 490 U.S. 401,\n\n413-19 (1989).       The plaintiffs agree that the Turner standard\n\napplies but challenge the district court's determination that the\n\ninmate-mail regulation survives scrutiny under that standard. None\n\nof the plaintiffs' objections to the district court's Turner\n\nanalysis is availing.\n\n            As to the first Turner factor--whether the regulation is\n\nrationally related to a legitimate governmental interest, Turner,\n\n482 U.S. at 89--the plaintiffs do not dispute that prison security\n\n\n                                         -2-\n\fis   a   legitimate   governmental    interest,      nor   could    they.    See\n\nThornburgh, 490 U.S. at 415 (finding legitimacy of that interest to\n\nbe \"beyond question\").      Rather, they fault the district court for\n\ndeferring to former Commissioner Bender's view, \"[b]ased on [his]\n\nexperience and professional judgment, [that] the allowance of\n\npublications into correctional institutions which contain sexually\n\nexplicit material or feature nudity is . . . detrimental to . . .\n\nthe safety and the security of the institution.\"\n\n              That argument fails.    \"[T]he judiciary[, which] is 'ill\n\nequipped' to deal with the difficult and delicate problems of\n\nprison    management,\"    id.   at   407-08,   \"must       accord   substantial\n\ndeference to the professional judgment of prison administrators,\n\nwho bear a significant responsibility for defining the legitimate\n\ngoals    of   a   corrections   system   and   for    determining     the   most\n\nappropriate means to accomplish them,\" Overton v. Bazzetta, 539\n\nU.S. 126, 132 (2003); see also Beard, 548 U.S. at 535, particularly\n\nwith respect to matters affecting prison security, Beard, 548 U.S.\n\nat 536; Poirier v. Mass. Dep't of Correction, 558 F.3d 92, 96 (1st\n\nCir. 2009).        Here, deference to the Commissioner's views was\n\nparticularly appropriate because those views were based on his long\n\nand varied experience as a corrections official and buttressed by\n\nconcrete examples of how restricting prisoners' receipt of sexually\n\nexplicit materials is related to prison safety and security. Thus,\n\nthe district court appropriately relied on the Commissioner's\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\faffidavit to establish the requisite rational connection between\n\nthe legitimate government interests articulated there and the\n\nchosen means of furthering them.   Beard, 548 U.S. at 541-42.\n\n          The plaintiffs' contentions that the defendants were\n\nrequired to provide direct evidence of the incidents cited in the\n\nCommissioner's affidavit and to prove that the incidents were\n\nactually caused by inmates' exposure to sexually explicit material\n\ninverts the proper burden of proof.   \"The burden . . . is not on\n\nthe State to prove the validity of prison regulations but on the\n\nprisoner to disprove it.\"     Overton, 536 U.S. at 132.         Those\n\narguments also reflect a misunderstanding of the nature of the\n\ninquiry. Determining whether a challenged regulation is rationally\n\nrelated to a legitimate governmental interest does not require\n\nmaking factual findings that the regulation will, in fact, serve\n\nits intended purpose.   Turner, 482 U.S. at 93 n.*.\n\n          Here, the plaintiffs attempted to meet their burden by\n\nsubmitting affidavits and exhibits purportedly demonstrating the\n\nirrationality of the regulation or the existence of disputed facts,\n\nas was their prerogative under Rule 56(e) of the Federal Rules of\n\nCivil Procedure.   See Beard, 548 U.S. at 534.        Although, with\n\nrespect to issues of fact, the district court was required to \"draw\n\n'all justifiable inferences' in [the plaintiffs'] 'favor,'\" id. at\n\n529 (quoting Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 255\n\n(1986)), no such requirement applies to matters of professional\n\n\n                                -4-\n\fjudgment.    Id. at 530.      In such matters, the district court was\n\nrequired to \"accord deference to the views of prison authorities,\"\n\nid., not to the plaintiffs' views as to whether the regulation\n\nserves its stated purposes.          To the extent that the plaintiffs'\n\nsubmissions focused on the effect of the regulation on their\n\nrights, those submissions were irrelevant to the first Turner\n\nfactor,    the   regulation's   rational      connection   to   a   legitimate\n\npurpose.    \"'Rational basis review does not permit consideration of\n\nthe strength of the individual's interest or the extent of the\n\nintrusion on that interest caused by the [regulation]; the focus is\n\nentirely on the rationality of the state's reason for enacting the\n\n[regulation].'\"       Poirier, 558 F.3d at 96 (quoting Cook v. Gates,\n\n528 F.3d 42, 55 (1st Cir.), petition for cert. filed, 77 U.S.L.W.\n\n3400 (U.S. Dec. 23, 2008)).\n\n            Thus, the district court correctly concluded that the\n\ncrucial first Turner factor weighs in the defendants' favor.\n\nMoses, 523 F. Supp. 2d at 62.        The remaining factors serve only as\n\nfurther checks on the regulation's reasonableness. Beard, 548 U.S.\n\nat 523.\n\n            As   to   the   second   Turner    factor--whether      there   are\n\n\"alternative means of exercising the right that remain open to\n\nprison inmates,\" Turner, 482 U.S. at 90--the plaintiffs argue that\n\nthey do not have alternative means of receiving sexually explicit\n\nmaterials.       That argument defines the \"right\" in question too\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fnarrowly. Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 417 (requiring that \"'the right'\n\nin question be viewed sensibly and expansively\").                Where, as here,\n\n\"the    [inmate-mail]      regulation        permit[s]      a   broad    range     of\n\npublications to be sent, received, and read, th[e] [second Turner]\n\nfactor is clearly satisfied.\"           Id. at 418.         Moreover, even if no\n\nalternative means of receiving publications existed, that \"would\n\nnot be conclusive . . . [but] would [only] be some evidence that\n\nthe regulation[] w[as] unreasonable.\"               Overton, 539 U.S. at 135.\n\n           As   to   the       third   Turner   factor--\"the      impact    [that]\n\naccommodation of the asserted constitutional right w[ould] have on\n\nguards and other inmates, and on the allocation of prison resources\n\ngenerally,\" Turner, 482 U.S. at 78--the plaintiffs rely on extra-\n\nrecord material attached to their appellate brief to argue that\n\nallowing unrestricted access to sexually explicit publications\n\nwould have no adverse impact.            Assuming that we may consider the\n\ncited   materials    as    evidence     of    \"legislative,\"      as    opposed    to\n\n\"adjudicative,\" facts, see Daggett v. Comm'n on Governmental Ethics\n\nand Election Practices, 172 F.3d 104, 112 (1st Cir. 1999), we\n\nnevertheless give greater weight to \"'the informed discretion of\n\ncorrections officials,'\" Thornburgh, 490 U.S. at 418 (quoting\n\nTurner,   490   U.S.      at    90),   who    are    most    familiar    with     the\n\ndifficulties of managing their own institutions, than to the more\n\ngeneral views expressed in the cited materials as to other means of\n\naddressing sexual violence in prison.\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\f            As to the fourth and final Turner factor--\"the absence of\n\nready alternatives,\" Turner, 482 U.S. at 90--the plaintiffs do not\n\nargue     for    the   alternative   considered      and   rejected     by   the\n\ndefendants, i.e., allowing receipt of sexually explicit materials\n\non a case-by-case basis. Instead, they argue that allowing inmates\n\nto receive all publications as long as they are not \"obscene\" as\n\ndefined by state law is a readily available alternative.                But, as\n\ndiscussed above, that alternative would have more than a de minimus\n\nadverse effect on legitimate penological interests and therefore is\n\nneither     an    \"obvious\"   nor    an     \"easy\"   alternative      solution,\n\nThornburgh, 490 U.S. at 418, to the problems that the regulation\n\nwas intended to address.       Therefore, the district court correctly\n\nconcluded that plaintiffs had not met their burden of satisfying\n\nthe \"high standard\" for demonstrating the existence of a \"ready\n\nalternative.\"       Overton, 539 U.S. at 136.\n\nB.   As-Applied Challenge to the Inmate-Mail Regulation\n\n            The plaintiffs make two arguments with respect to the\n\ndistrict    court's     upholding    of    the   inmate-mail   regulation     as\n\napplied.        First, they challenge the exclusion of portions of a\n\nNational Geographic article as being unrelated to the governmental\n\ninterest    in    rehabilitation.         However,   without   copies   of   the\n\nexcluded material or even specific descriptions of it, it was\n\nimpossible for the district court (and is equally impossible for\n\nthis court) to determine whether the regulation is invalid as\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fapplied to that material. To the extent that plaintiffs argue that\n\nthe National Geographic materials fell within the regulation's\n\nexception for \"material illustrative of . . . anthropological\n\ncontent,\" 103 C.M.R. ยง 481.15((3)(d), that is a state-law issue,\n\nwhich the district court appropriately declined to address once it\n\ndisposed of plaintiffs' federal claims.         Cao v. Puerto Rico, 525\n\nF.3d 112, 116 (1st Cir. 2008).1\n\n          The second issue raised under the as-applied rubric is\n\nthat the regulation is not applied even-handedly. As evidence, the\n\nplaintiffs   point   to    a   memorandum   indicating   that   at   another\n\ninstitution inmates are permitted to receive material containing\n\npictures of exposed buttocks, while at Cedar Junction, where most\n\nof the plaintiffs are incarcerated, they are not. The short answer\n\nto that argument is that the two institutions may not be similarly\n\nsituated. There is therefore nothing arbitrary or capricious about\n\napplying the regulation more strictly at Cedar Junction than at the\n\nother institution.        As the Supreme Court stated in upholding a\n\nsimilar regulation against a similar challenge, \"The exercise of\n\ndiscretion called for by th[is] regulation may produce seeming\n\n\n\n     1\n      Another state-law issue that plaintiffs advert to is whether\nsome of the publications on the \"prohibited publications list\" in\nfact contain \"nudity\" or \"sexually explicit\" material within the\nmeaning of the regulation. Although the district court's method of\nmaking that finding--i.e., taking \"judicial notice\" that many of\nthe listed publications \"invariably contain\" such material, Moses,\n523 F. Supp. 2d at 64--is dubious, the correctness of its finding\non that state-law issue is not before us.\n\n                                     -8-\n\f'inconsistencies,' but what may appear to be inconsistent results\n\nare not necessarily signs of arbitrariness or irrationality[,]\n\n[g]iven the likely variability . . . between institutions . . . .\"\n\nThornburgh, 490 U.S. at 417 n.15; see also Savard v. Rhode Island,\n\n338 F.3d 23, 30-31 (1st Cir. 2003).\n\n C. Other Constitutional Challenges to the Inmate-Mail Regulation\n\n            The plaintiffs correctly point out that the district\n\n court failed to address the other constitutional challenges to\n\n the inmate-mail regulation that were added by their amended\n\n complaint, all of which stem from the purported inconsistency\n\n between the regulation and the state obscenity statute. However,\n\n those challenges are not developed in the plaintiffs' brief,\n\n which merely alludes to the arguments made in their summary\n\n judgment   memorandum.    Consequently,   those   challenges   are\n\n forfeited. R.I. Dep't of Envtl. Mgmt. v. United States, 304 F.3d\n\n 31, 47 (1st Cir. 2002).\n\n D.   Challenges to the Cell-Decoration Policy\n\n            As the plaintiffs also point out, the district court\n\n did not expressly rule on the constitutionality of the cell-\n\n decoration policy.   Rather, it conflated that policy with the\n\n inmate-mail regulation, which it described as banning the receipt\n\n (as opposed to merely the display) of semi-nude and scantily clad\n\n images, Moses, 523 F. Supp. 2d at 58, 64, and then proceeded to\n\n uphold the constitutionality of that ban on its face, id. at 63,\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fand as applied, id. at 63-65.    However, the absence of a separate\n\nruling on the constitutionality of the cell-decoration policy is\n\nnot fatal, since much of the district court's analysis of the\n\nTurner factors is equally applicable to the cell-decoration\n\npolicy, and we review the district court's grant of summary\n\njudgment de novo, In re Citigroup, Inc., 535 F.3d 45, 50 (1st\n\nCir. 2008), and are free to affirm it on any grounds apparent\n\nfrom the record, Mulloy v. Acushnet Co., 460 F.3d 141, 145 (1st\n\nCir. 2006).\n\n           To the extent that the plaintiffs challenge the policy\n\non its face as violating the First Amendment, that challenge\n\nfails.   \"'In a facial attack . . ., it is plaintiff[s'] burden to\n\nshow that the [policy] has no constitutional application.'\"          Del\n\nGallo v. Parent, 557 F.3d 58, 68 (1st Cir. 2009) (quoting Naser\n\nJewelers, Inc. v. City of Concord, 513 F.3d 27, 33 (2008)).\n\n\"'The fact that [it] might operate unconstitutionally under some\n\nconceivable set of circumstances is insufficient to render it\n\nwholly invalid.'\"   Dutil v. Murphy, 550 F.3d 154, 160 (1st Cir.\n\n2008), cert. denied, 77 U.S.L.W. 3595 (U.S. Apr. 27, 2009).           As\n\nrecognized by Massachusetts courts in upholding a predecessor of\n\nthe   cell-decoration   policy   challenged   here,   the   policy    is\n\nreasonably related to legitimate governmental interests including\n\nprison security, Collins v. Mass. Dep't of Correction, No. 95-\n\n0153, 1995 WL 542517 (Mass. Super. Sept. 7, 1995) (unpublished);\n\n\n                                 -10-\n\fPerito    v.    Duval,   No.   91-2387    (Mass.    Super.    Feb.   25,   1992)\n\n(unpublished) (Red Br. Add. at 48-50), aff'd, 34 Mass. App. Ct.\n\n1114     (1993)     (table),     and     therefore    is      susceptible    of\n\nconstitutional       application.        Although    those    nonprecedential\n\ndecisions are not binding on this court, their reasoning is\n\npersuasive and consistent with the Turner factors. The fact that\n\nthe policy might be applied to prohibit the display of relatively\n\ninnocuous pictures, such as a family outing at the beach, does\n\nnot render the regulation invalid on its face.                Dutil, 550 F.3d\n\nat 160.\n\n               In one conclusory sentence, plaintiffs also challenge\n\nthe policy as impermissibly vague.            As a threshold matter, it\n\nis doubtful that the plaintiffs here have standing to raise a\n\nvagueness challenge since the only picture in the record whose\n\ndisplay    was     allegedly     prohibited   by     the     cell-decoration\n\npolicy--a photograph of a woman wearing lacy underwear and a\n\ngarterbelt and posing with her thighs spread apart--clearly\n\nfalls    within    the   terms    \"scantily    clad,\"      \"semi-nude,\"     or\n\n\"sexually suggestive.\"         Whiting v. Town of Westerly, 942 F.2d\n\n18, 22 (1st Cir. 1991) (holding that \"a plaintiff who engages\n\nin conduct that is         clearly proscribed by the [challenged\n\nprovision] cannot complain that the [provision] is vague on its\n\nface nor challenge the vagueness of the law as applied to the\n\nconduct of others\").       Even if such standing exists, those terms\n\n\n                                    -11-\n\fare not so subjective or indeterminate that an \"ordinary person\n\nexercising ordinary common sense\" would be unable to understand\n\nand comply with them.      Welch v. United States, 750 F.2d 1101,\n\n1112 (1st Cir. 1985).      Consequently, the plaintiffs' vagueness\n\nchallenge to the cell-decoration policy also fails.\n\n            Accordingly,    the   district   court's   judgment   is\n\naffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -12-\n\f",

Here, deference to the Commissioner's views was\n\nparticularly appropriate because those views were based on his long\n\nand varied experience as a corrections official and buttressed by\n\nconcrete examples of how restricting prisoners' receipt of sexually\n\nexplicit materials is related to prison safety and security. Thus,\n\nthe district court appropriately relied on the Commissioner's\n\n\n                                     -3-\n\faffidavit to establish the requisite rational connection between\n\nthe legitimate government interests articulated there and the\n\nchosen means of furthering them.   Beard, 548 U.S. at 541-42.\n\n          The plaintiffs' contentions that the defendants were\n\nrequired to provide direct evidence of the incidents cited in the\n\nCommissioner's affidavit and to prove that the incidents were\n\nactually caused by inmates' exposure to sexually explicit material\n\ninverts the proper burden of proof.   \"The burden . . . is not on\n\nthe State to prove the validity of prison regulations but on the\n\nprisoner to disprove it.\"     Overton, 536 U.S. at 132.         Those\n\narguments also reflect a misunderstanding of the nature of the\n\ninquiry.

Assuming that we may consider the\n\ncited   materials    as    evidence     of    \"legislative,\"      as    opposed    to\n\n\"adjudicative,\" facts, see Daggett v.

Instead, they argue that allowing inmates\n\nto receive all publications as long as they are not \"obscene\" as\n\ndefined by state law is a readily available alternative.                But, as\n\ndiscussed above, that alternative would have more than a de minimus\n\nadverse effect on legitimate penological interests and therefore is\n\nneither     an    \"obvious\"   nor    an     \"easy\"   alternative      solution,\n\nThornburgh, 490 U.S. at 418, to the problems that the regulation\n\nwas intended to address.       Therefore, the district court correctly\n\nconcluded that plaintiffs had not met their burden of satisfying\n\nthe \"high standard\" for demonstrating the existence of a \"ready\n\nalternative.\"       Overton, 539 U.S. at 136.\n\nB.   As-Applied Challenge to the Inmate-Mail Regulation\n\n            The plaintiffs make two arguments with respect to the\n\ndistrict    court's     upholding    of    the   inmate-mail   regulation     as\n\napplied.        First, they challenge the exclusion of portions of a\n\nNational Geographic article as being unrelated to the governmental\n\ninterest    in    rehabilitation.         However,   without   copies   of   the\n\nexcluded material or even specific descriptions of it, it was\n\nimpossible for the district court (and is equally impossible for\n\nthis court) to determine whether the regulation is invalid as\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fapplied to that material. To the extent that plaintiffs argue that\n\nthe National Geographic materials fell within the regulation's\n\nexception for \"material illustrative of . . . anthropological\n\ncontent,\" 103 C.M.R. ยง 481.15((3)(d), that is a state-law issue,\n\nwhich the district court appropriately declined to address once it\n\ndisposed of plaintiffs' federal claims.         Cao v. Puerto Rico, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203318\"><a href=\"/opinion/203318/cao-v-puerto-rico/\"><span class=\"volume\">525</span>\n\n<span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 116 (1st Cir. 2008).1\n\n          The second issue raised under the as-applied rubric is\n\nthat the regulation is not applied even-handedly. As evidence, the\n\nplaintiffs   point   to    a   memorandum   indicating   that   at   another\n\ninstitution inmates are permitted to receive material containing\n\npictures of exposed buttocks, while at Cedar Junction, where most\n\nof the plaintiffs are incarcerated, they are not. The short answer\n\nto that argument is that the two institutions may not be similarly\n\nsituated. There is therefore nothing arbitrary or capricious about\n\napplying the regulation more strictly at Cedar Junction than at the\n\nother institution.        As the Supreme Court stated in upholding a\n\nsimilar regulation against a similar challenge, \"The exercise of\n\ndiscretion called for by th[is] regulation may produce seeming\n\n\n\n     1\n      Another state-law issue that plaintiffs advert to is whether\nsome of the publications on the \"prohibited publications list\" in\nfact contain \"nudity\" or \"sexually explicit\" material within the\nmeaning of the regulation. Although the district court's method of\nmaking that finding--i.e., taking \"judicial notice\" that many of\nthe listed publications \"invariably contain\" such material, Moses,\n523 F. Supp. 2d at 64--is dubious, the correctness of its finding\non that state-law issue is not before us.\n\n                                     -8-\n\f'inconsistencies,' but what may appear to be inconsistent results\n\nare not necessarily signs of arbitrariness or irrationality[,]\n\n[g]iven the likely variability . . . between institutions . . . .\"\n\nThornburgh, 490 U.S. at 417 n.15; see also Savard v.

Other Constitutional Challenges to the Inmate-Mail Regulation\n\n            The plaintiffs correctly point out that the district\n\n court failed to address the other constitutional challenges to\n\n the inmate-mail regulation that were added by their amended\n\n complaint, all of which stem from the purported inconsistency\n\n between the regulation and the state obscenity statute. However,\n\n those challenges are not developed in the plaintiffs' brief,\n\n which merely alludes to the arguments made in their summary\n\n judgment   memorandum.    Consequently,   those   challenges   are\n\n forfeited. R.I. Dep't of Envtl. Mgmt. v.

Challenges to the Cell-Decoration Policy\n\n            As the plaintiffs also point out, the district court\n\n did not expressly rule on the constitutionality of the cell-\n\n decoration policy.   Rather, it conflated that policy with the\n\n inmate-mail regulation, which it described as banning the receipt\n\n (as opposed to merely the display) of semi-nude and scantily clad\n\n images, Moses, 523 F. Supp. 2d at 58, 64, and then proceeded to\n\n uphold the constitutionality of that ban on its face, id. at 63,\n\n\n                                -9-\n\fand as applied, id. at 63-65.
