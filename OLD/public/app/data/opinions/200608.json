Brock Hornby, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                         Lynch, Circuit Judge,\n\n                   R. Arnold,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n\n                      and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     William Maselli, for appellant.\n     Margaret D. McGaughey, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, was on brief for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           August 22, 2003\n\n\n\n\n     *\n      Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit,\nsitting by designation.\n\f             R.    ARNOLD,    Senior    Circuit    Judge.         Joel    Keene   was\n\nconvicted of possession with intent to distribute more than 500\n\ngrams   of    cocaine      and     possession    with    intent    to     distribute\n\nmarijuana, and was subjected to forfeiture of his residence for his\n\ndrug convictions. He was sentenced to a total of sixty-six months’\n\nimprisonment with forty-eight months of supervised release. He was\n\nfined $12,500.        He appeals the convictions, the fine, and the\n\nforfeiture on a variety of grounds.              We affirm in all respects.\n\n             After a decade of intermittent reports of drug dealing\n\nby defendant Keene from four separate informants, police obtained\n\na nighttime, no-knock search warrant for his somewhat isolated\n\nresidence in Norway, Maine. They immediately found 23 kilograms of\n\ncompressed marijuana, 3.86 kilograms of loose marijuana, and 890.7\n\ngrams of 60 per cent. pure cocaine in a garage adjoining the house,\n\nand smaller quantities of drugs along with drug paraphernalia in\n\nhis house.        They arrested Keene and charged him with possession\n\nwith intent to distribute the drugs.              His first trial ended in a\n\nmistrial.     His second trial was bifurcated, with the forfeiture\n\ncount   severed     from     the    possession    with   intent     to    distribute\n\ncharges.     He was convicted by a jury after a motion to suppress\n\nevidence obtained during the search was denied.                          This appeal\n\nfollowed.\n\n\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\f                                    I.\n\n            Appellant raises six issues on appeal.         First, he argues\n\nthat the search warrant obtained by police was not supported by\n\nprobable cause, because the information relied on was stale and\n\nthere was no nexus with the property to be searched.          Second, there\n\nwas insufficient evidence of his possession of cocaine with an\n\nintent to distribute. Third, the instructions given to the jury on\n\naiding and abetting and willful blindness were not supported by the\n\nevidence.    Fourth, the prosecution’s invitation to the jury to\n\nanalyze defendant’s handwriting was improper and denied him a fair\n\ntrial.    Fifth, the government made references to his lifestyle in\n\nits closing argument, which also denied him a fair trial. Finally,\n\nthe defendant argues that the imposition of a fine was improper,\n\nand that the government’s request for a forfeiture should have been\n\ndenied.\n\n                          A.     Probable Cause\n\n            Defendant   argues   that     Maine   Drug   Enforcement   agents\n\nrelied on stale information to obtain a nighttime, no-knock warrant\n\nfor his residence, and that evidence of drug dealing suggested by\n\nthis information had an inadequate nexus to the property searched.\n\nWe disagree.\n\n            Probable cause to issue a search warrant exists when\n\n“given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit . . . there\n\nis a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fbe found in a particular place.”            Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213,\n\n238 (1983).      The task of the reviewing court is to determine\n\nwhether    “a   substantial        basis”       existed    for    the    magistrate’s\n\ndetermination that probable cause existed.                   Ibid.      Factors to be\n\nconsidered in determining whether a search warrant should issue\n\ninclude “the value of corroboration of details of an informant’s\n\ntips by independent police work.”                Id. at 241.\n\n            Police      provided       detailed         information        from     four\n\nconfidential informants to the magistrate judge in applying for the\n\nsearch warrant.         Maine Drug Enforcement Special Agent Tony L.\n\nMilligan obtained this information.                     The first informant was\n\ninterviewed     in    1992   and   provided       specific       information,     while\n\nincarcerated,        about   his   drug     dealings      with    six    individuals,\n\nincluding    defendant,       at   a   Saracens        Motorcycle       Club   hangout.\n\nMembers of the Saracens had been convicted of drug dealing.                       Other\n\ninformation provided by this informant had resulted in successful\n\nprosecution of significant drug traffickers.                     Two years later, a\n\nsecond informant, a concerned citizen with no criminal record who\n\nwas “sick and tired” of drug activity connected with the Saracens\n\nMotorcycle Club, came forward. He too gave specifics about Keene’s\n\ndrug   distribution      activities       and    drug     delivery      services,    and\n\nprovided    eyewitness       accounts     of     his    substantial,      unexplained\n\nwealth.    This information was also corroborated.                  In 1996, a third\n\ninformant, a convicted felon, also provided information about\n\n\n                                          -4-\n\fKeene’s drug activities.          Finally, a little more than a month\n\nbefore Agent Milligan applied for the search warrant, he received\n\ninformation    from    Somerset    County     Sheriff   Detective   Lt.    Carl\n\nGottardi about his interview with a highly reliable source, who was\n\ncharged with no crime and was not paid for his information.                This\n\ninformant recounted first-hand observations of Keene’s large-scale\n\ncocaine sales, and indicated that Keene also supplied drugs to the\n\nSaracens and Hell’s Angels Motorcycle Clubs.            In the month leading\n\nup to application for the warrant, this informant identified one of\n\nKeene’s   regular     cocaine   customers     and   provided   details    about\n\nKeene’s habits which police corroborated.\n\n             Since the information provided by the four informants\n\nover a ten-year period was amply corroborated, was consistent with\n\na drug conspiracy of long duration, and had been updated within the\n\nmonth before application for the warrant, there was probable cause\n\nfor issuance of the warrant.\n\n             Defendant also argues that the information provided did\n\nnot establish a sufficient nexus between drug activity and the\n\nproperty to be searched, and so the warrant should not have issued.\n\nSee United States v. Lalor, 996 F.2d 1578, 1582 (4th Cir. 1993).\n\nHowever, the informants provided information about drug sales by\n\ndefendant,    evidence    of    substantial    wealth   unexplained   by    his\n\nworkers’ compensation benefits, and the fact that he worked from\n\nhome while recovering from back injuries for which he drew the\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fworkers’   compensation.         This   information   suggested    that    drug\n\ndistribution was being organized from Keene’s residence, a place\n\nwhich was safe and accessible.           United States v. Feliz, 182 F.3d\n\n82,    87-88    (1st   Cir.   1999).      The   information   established     a\n\nsufficient nexus with the property to be searched, and probable\n\ncause existed for the warrant to issue.\n\n                        B.    Sufficiency of Evidence\n\n               Drugs, drugs everywhere, but none belonged to defendant.\n\nThis is the proposition of which defendant failed to convince a\n\njury, and the one which he now asks this Court to accept.                 We do\n\nnot.\n\n               In order to prevail on a claim of insufficient evidence\n\na defendant must make a “formidable showing.”             United States v.\n\nValerio, 48 F.3d 58, 63 (1st Cir. 1995).              To determine whether\n\nevidence was sufficient, “we examine the record in a light most\n\nfavorable to the government, drawing all reasonable inferences in\n\nits favor, with an eye towards whether the proof would have allowed\n\na rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the\n\ndefendant was guilty of the crime charged.”           Ibid. (quoting United\n\nStates v. Ortiz, 23 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir. 1994)).             Both direct and\n\ncircumstantial evidence are considered, and the government’s proof\n\nmay lie “entirely in circumstantial evidence.”            Ibid.    Defendant\n\nargues that the drugs found by police at his home were found in a\n\n\n\n\n                                        -6-\n\fgarage bay to which many people had access, and that the government\n\nsupplied no substantial evidence of sales of drugs by Keene.\n\n             When twenty officers executed the search warrant, after\n\narresting Keene, his girlfriend, and his father, they searched\n\ndefendant’s garages.        On entering the first garage, Agent Milligan\n\nwas   overwhelmed      by   the   strong   odor   of    fresh    marijuana,   and\n\nimmediately noticed a large white cooler and packing materials on\n\nthe floor.    Inside the cooler were three large trash bags, each of\n\nwhich contained kilogram-sized bricks of compressed marijuana and\n\na piece of paper with numbers written on it.               The total weight of\n\nthe marijuana found was fifty-two pounds.              On the table at the back\n\nof the garage a triple beam balance scale and commercial digital\n\nscale were found with marijuana residue on them.                 Upstairs, more\n\nboxes with fresh marijuana residue, scales, and UPS labels were\n\nfound, along with shipping boxes.           In a corner of this garage, at\n\nthe bottom of a pile of automobile tires was a metal ammunition\n\ncanister inside of which were thirty-two knotted plastic bags, each\n\nof which contained a chunk of 60 per cent. pure rock cocaine.                   A\n\nfive-gallon pail sat against the back wall with ziplock bags\n\ncontaining loose mildewed marijuana and bricks of fresh marijuana.\n\nMarijuana buds were found inside unmounted motorcycle tires.                    A\n\nblue plastic tub contained another ziplock bag of fresh, brick\n\nmarijuana.    In a hole in the brick wall was another tub containing\n\nmarijuana in     ten    ziplock    bags.     Small     amounts    of   marijuana,\n\n\n                                      -7-\n\fcocaine, and drug paraphernalia were found throughout the house, as\n\nwell as address books and ATV registrations.              When confronted with\n\nthese findings after his arrest, Keene responded that someone else\n\nmust have put the drugs in his garage.            The jury reasonably found\n\nthis explanation incredible.       Because substantial evidence existed\n\nto sustain defendant’s convictions, we affirm.\n\n              C.   Instructions and Statements to the Jury\n\n          Appellant         challenges     both     the     District     Court’s\n\ninstructions as to the government’s burden of proof for willful\n\nblindness, and its instructions as to what was required to convict\n\nKeene of aiding and abetting.\n\n          The standard of review for a challenge of this type to\n\njury instructions as erroneous is de novo.                  United States v.\n\nMarino, 277 F.3d 11, 28 (1st Cir. 2002).                  A willful-blindness\n\ninstruction “is proper if a defendant claims a lack of knowledge,\n\nthe facts suggest a conscious course of deliberate ignorance, and\n\nthe instruction, taken as a whole, cannot be misunderstood as\n\nmandating an inference of knowledge.”            United States v. Masse, 816\n\nF.2d 805, 812 (1st Cir. 1987).       As this Court recently pointed out\n\nin another drug distribution case, “whether there was knowledge of\n\ndrug dealing, or so much awareness that ignorance was willful\n\nblindness,”    may   turn    exclusively    on    circumstantial       evidence.\n\nUnited States v. Corchado-Peralta, 318 F.3d 255, 258 (1st Cir.\n\n2003). The District Court instructed members of the jury that they\n\n\n                                     -8-\n\f“may” infer knowledge from conscious ignorance, not that they were\n\nrequired to do so.      See United States v. Bilis, 170 F.3d 88, 92\n\n(1st Cir. 1999). The instructions contained a clear explanation of\n\nwhat the jury was required to find in order to determine whether\n\nMr. Keene had been willfully blind to the presence of large\n\nquantities of drugs on his property.             In particular, the lower\n\ncourt explained that it was “important to bear in mind that mere\n\nnegligence    or   mistake   in   failing   to   learn   the   facts   is    not\n\nsufficient.    There must be a deliberate effort to remain ignorant\n\nof the fact.”      Jury Instructions at 10 (#32).         The instructions\n\ngave an accurate statement of the pertinent law.\n\n             Appellant also argues that, because the crime of aiding\n\nand abetting was not charged in the indictment, the jury should not\n\nhave been instructed about it.       A defendant may be convicted as an\n\naider and abettor if the evidence shows:          (1) that the underlying\n\noffense was committed by a principal; (2) that the defendant\n\nconsciously shared the principal’s knowledge; and (3) that he\n\n“willfully associated himself in some way with the crime and\n\nwillfully participated in it as he would in something he wished to\n\nbring about.” United States v. Henderson, 320 F.3d 92, 109-10 (1st\n\nCir. 2003).    When asked about the fifty-two pounds of marijuana in\n\nhis garage, Keene observed, “It’s been there for a while.”                  When\n\ntold he faced serious drug charges, he asked that his girlfriend\n\nnot be charged, stating “it’s my house, it’s my garage . . . .                 I\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\fguess it’s my responsibility.”                 He later speculated that “whoever\n\nput the marijuana there must have put the coke there as well.”\n\n             An instruction on aiding and abetting may be given\n\nalthough there is no reference to the crime in the indictment.\n\nUnited States v. Footman, 215 F.3d 145, 154 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\nIndeed, a charge of aiding and abetting is implicit in indictments\n\nfor substantive offenses.                Ibid.      The revisor’s note to 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 2 states that “one who puts in motion or assists in the illegal\n\nenterprise    .    .   .    is     guilty      as     a   principal     even    though    he\n\nintentionally      refrained           from   the     direct     act   constituting      the\n\ncompleted offense.”             The instruction was proper, and since it had\n\nbeen given in Keene’s first trial, which ended in a mistrial, he\n\ncannot claim that the charge came as a surprise to him in the\n\nsecond trial.      The instructions on aiding and abetting and willful\n\nblindness were proper.\n\n                           D.    Prosecutorial Statements\n\n             Defendant          claims    that       in   its    closing    argument     the\n\ngovernment erred in a manner serious enough to require reversal of\n\nthe   jury    verdict,          both     by   inviting      the    jurors      to   examine\n\nhandwriting evidence in an improper fashion and by maligning\n\ndefendant’s character.             These claims are without merit.\n\n             The   prosecution           suggested        that   jurors    could    analyze\n\nhandwriting evidence on numbered labels from drug containers by\n\ncomparing it with samples of defendant’s handwriting to establish\n\n\n                                              -10-\n\fa connection between Mr. Keene and the drugs found on his property.\n\nUnder 28 U.S.C. § 1731, “[t]he admitted or proved handwriting of\n\nany person shall be admissible, for purposes of comparison, to\n\ndetermine genuineness of other handwriting attributed to such\n\nperson.”      The    trier   of    fact   is     authorized    to   make   such   a\n\ncomparison, with or without the benefit of expert testimony.                  Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 901(b)(3).        See United States v. Scott, 270 F.3d 30, 49\n\nn.13 (1st Cir. 2001).\n\n            To emphasize that handwriting comparisons could indeed be\n\nperformed with only handwritten numbers (rather than letters) for\n\ncomparison, the prosecution suggested that if jurors themselves\n\nwrote the same numbers on a piece of paper and compared them with\n\nthe   samples,      they   would   see    that    written     numbers   too   were\n\ndistinctive.     Defendant argues that in making this suggestion, the\n\nprosecutor asked the jurors to make a determination they were\n\nunqualified to make, and encouraged them to create evidence for the\n\npurpose of comparison.        But the prosecutor merely suggested this\n\nmode of comparison and argued for a factual finding favorable to\n\nthe government.       He did not suggest it would be determinative of\n\nguilt.     The jury was free to disregard the suggestion, especially\n\nsince other substantial evidence connected Keene to the drugs. The\n\nprosecutorial statement did not constitute reversible error.\n\n            Defendant objects as well to the government’s disparaging\n\nreferences in its closing statement to his lifestyle and character.\n\n\n                                      -11-\n\fBecause this issue is raised for the first time on appeal, we\n\nreview only for plain error.             Henderson, 320 F.3d at 105.          Mr.\n\nKeene must show not only that the arguments were prejudicial and\n\naffected his substantial rights, but that, absent reversal, a\n\nmiscarriage of justice would occur.              Mr. Keene draws particular\n\nattention to the prosecution’s emphasis on the fact that he had\n\ndrawn workers’ compensation for a period of years as an example of\n\nthe government’s attempt to malign his character by implying he was\n\nlazy or parasitical.          Defendant misconstrues the thrust of this\n\npart of the closing argument.           The transcript makes clear that the\n\nprosecution drew the jury’s attention to the fact that Keene was\n\nnot working a regular job in order to raise a question as to how,\n\nwithout      regular   income,    he    was    able    to   afford   a   luxurious\n\nlifestyle.      This was an eminently reasonable argument to make,\n\ngiven that it pointed to the likelihood that Mr. Keene’s lifestyle\n\nwas   made    possible   by    income    from    the    sale   of    drugs.   The\n\nprosecutor’s statements were proper.\n\n                          E.     Fine and Forfeiture\n\n              Defendant argues that the imposition of a fine of $12,500\n\nby the court, when the pre-sentence investigation report (PSI)\n\nrecommended against a fine, and the government failed to object to\n\nthis recommendation, is improper.                In these circumstances, we\n\nreview imposition of a fine for abuse of discretion. United States\n\nv. Cunan, 152 F.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir. 1998).                  Cf. United States v.\n\n\n                                        -12-\n\fThurston, 2003 WL 21782339 at *23 (1st Cir.)(holding that where a\n\nlower court declines to impose a fine when it is mandated by\n\nstatute, review of questions of law is de novo).\n\n            In recommending against a fine, the PSI had made the\n\nerroneous assumption that, after forfeiture of his residence,\n\ndefendant would have no assets left with which to pay a fine.                     In\n\nfact, his known assets, even after forfeiture of his house, totaled\n\nover $50,000.      The imposition of a fine at the lowest end of the\n\nGuideline range is well within judicial discretion, and Keene has\n\nnot argued that he is unable to pay the amount.                 Further, the court\n\noffered    Keene   additional    time       to   develop    a    response   to   the\n\ngovernment’s request for a fine at sentencing - time he chose not\n\nto use.    We find no abuse of discretion in the imposition of a fine\n\nhere.     Whether to impose a fine is the prerogative of the court.\n\nThat the PSI recommended against a fine, whether or not the\n\nrecommendation     was   based   on     a    mistake       of   fact,   cannot    be\n\ndispositive.\n\n            Having convicted defendant of possession of drugs with\n\nintent to distribute, the jury found defendant’s residence was\n\nforfeit to the government. Defendant asserts that Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\n32.2 requires a “more active and searching inquiry” than that\n\nengaged in by the District Court to justify this forfeiture, and\n\nthat the government did not meet its burden of proof.\n\n\n\n\n                                      -13-\n\f            For the first time on appeal, defendant argues that under\n\nApprendi v.     New    Jersey,   530   U.S.   466   (2000),    the    applicable\n\nstandard of proof was proof beyond a reasonable doubt.                 However,\n\nother    circuits     have   consistently     refused   to    apply     Apprendi\n\nrequirements to criminal forfeitures.           United States v. Vera, 278\n\nF.3d 672, 673 (7th Cir. 2002); United States v. Cabeza, 258 F.3d\n\n1256, 1257 (11th Cir. 2001) (per curiam); United States v. Corrado,\n\n227 F.3d 543, 550-51 (6th Cir. 2000).         The forfeiture is not viewed\n\nas a separate charge, but as “an aspect of punishment imposed\n\nfollowing conviction of a substantive offense.”               Cabeza, 258 F.3d\n\nat 1257 (quoting Libretti v. United States, 516 U.S. 29, 39\n\n(1995)).    This is because      “drug trafficking is at the core of the\n\nconduct at which the forfeiture statutes are directed.”                   United\n\nStates v. One Clipper Bow Ketch Nisku, 548 F.2d 8, 11 (1st Cir.\n\n1977).     This Court has observed with approval that “almost every\n\ncircuit that has pronounced on the issue has held that the standard\n\nof proof as to forfeiture issues under section 853 . . . is a\n\npreponderance of the evidence.”          United States v. Rogers, 102 F.3d\n\n641, 647 (1st Cir. 1996).        The evidentiary standard used to impose\n\nthe forfeiture was proper, as was the forfeiture itself.                     The\n\npreponderance standard was certainly satisfied here.\n\n            For the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -14-\n\f",

He was sentenced to a total of sixty-six months' imprisonment with forty-eight months of supervised release. He was fined $12,500. He appeals the convictions, the fine, and the forfeiture on a variety of grounds. We affirm in all respects.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a decade of intermittent reports of drug dealing by defendant Keene from four separate informants, police obtained a nighttime, no-knock search warrant for his somewhat isolated residence in Norway, Maine. They immediately found 23 kilograms of compressed marijuana, 3.86 kilograms of loose marijuana, and 890.7 grams of 60 per cent. pure cocaine in a garage adjoining the house, and smaller quantities of drugs along with drug paraphernalia in his house. They arrested Keene and charged him with possession with intent to distribute the drugs. His first trial ended in a mistrial. His second trial was bifurcated, with the forfeiture count severed from the possession with intent to distribute charges. He was convicted by a jury after a motion to suppress evidence obtained during the search was denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant raises six issues on appeal. First, he argues that the search warrant obtained by police was not supported by probable cause, because the information relied on was stale and there was no nexus with the property to be searched. Second, there was insufficient evidence of his possession of cocaine with an intent to distribute. Third, the instructions given to the jury on aiding and abetting and willful blindness were not supported by the evidence. Fourth, the prosecution's invitation to the jury to analyze defendant's handwriting was improper and denied him a fair trial. Fifth, the government made references to his lifestyle in its closing argument, which also denied him a fair trial. Finally, the defendant argues that the imposition of a fine was improper, and that the government's request for a forfeiture should have been denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Probable Cause</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that Maine Drug Enforcement agents relied on stale information to obtain a nighttime, no-knock warrant for his residence, and that evidence of drug dealing suggested by this information had an inadequate nexus to the property searched. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Probable cause to issue a search warrant exists when \"given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit ... there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\" <i>Illinois v. Gates,</i> 462 U.S. 213, 238, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). The task of the reviewing court is to determine whether \"a substantial basis\" existed for the magistrate's determination that probable cause existed. <i>Ibid.</i> Factors to be considered in determining whether a search warrant should issue include \"the value of corroboration of details of an informant's tips by independent police work.\" <i>Id.</i> at 241, 103 S.Ct. 2317.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Police provided detailed information from four confidential informants to the magistrate judge in applying for the search warrant. Maine Drug Enforcement Special Agent Tony L. Milligan obtained this information. The first informant was interviewed in 1992 and provided specific information, while incarcerated, about his drug dealings with six individuals, including defendant, at a Saracens Motorcycle Club hangout. Members of the Saracens had been convicted of drug dealing. Other information provided by this informant had resulted in successful prosecution of significant drug traffickers. Two years later, a second informant, a concerned citizen with no criminal record who was \"sick and tired\" of drug activity connected with the Saracens Motorcycle Club, came forward. He too gave specifics about Keene's drug distribution activities and drug delivery services, and provided eyewitness accounts of his substantial, unexplained wealth. This information was also corroborated. In 1996, a third informant, a convicted felon, also provided information about Keene's drug activities. Finally, a little more than a month before Agent Milligan applied for the search warrant, he received information from Somerset County Sheriff Detective Lt. Carl Gottardi about his interview with a highly reliable source, who was charged with no crime and was not paid for his information. This informant recounted first-hand observations of Keene's large-scale cocaine sales, and indicated that Keene also supplied drugs to the Saracens and Hell's Angels Motorcycle Clubs. In the month leading up to application for the warrant, this informant identified one of Keene's regular cocaine customers and provided details about Keene's habits which police corroborated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the information provided by the four informants over a ten-year period was amply corroborated, was consistent with a drug conspiracy of long duration, and had been updated within the month before application for the warrant, there was probable cause for issuance of the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also argues that the information provided did not establish a sufficient nexus between drug activity and the property to be searched, and so the warrant should not have issued. <i>See United States v. Lalor,</i> 996 F.2d 1578, 1582 (4th Cir.1993). However, the informants provided information about drug sales by defendant, evidence of substantial wealth unexplained by his workers' compensation benefits, and the fact that he worked from home while recovering from back injuries for which he drew the workers' compensation. This information suggested that drug distribution was being organized from Keene's residence, a place which was safe and accessible. <i>United States v. Feliz,</i> 182 F.3d 82, 87-88 (1st Cir.1999). The information established a sufficient nexus with the property to be searched, and probable cause existed for the warrant to issue.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>B. Sufficiency of Evidence</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Drugs, drugs everywhere, but none belonged to defendant. This is the proposition of which defendant failed to convince a jury, and the one which he now asks this Court to accept. We do not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In order to prevail on a claim of insufficient evidence a defendant must make a \"formidable showing.\" <i>United States v. Valerio,</i> 48 F.3d 58, 63 (1st Cir.1995). To determine whether evidence was sufficient, \"we examine the record in a light most favorable to the government, drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor, with an eye towards whether the proof would have allowed a rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>United States v. Ortiz,</i> 23 F.3d 21, 24 (1st Cir.1994)). Both direct and circumstantial evidence are considered, and the government's proof may lie \"<i>entirely</i> in circumstantial evidence.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Defendant argues that the drugs found by police at his home were found in a garage bay to which many people had access, and that the government supplied no substantial evidence of sales of drugs by Keene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When twenty officers executed the search warrant, after arresting Keene, his girlfriend, and his father, they searched defendant's garages. On entering the first garage, Agent Milligan was overwhelmed by the strong odor of fresh marijuana, and immediately noticed a large white cooler and packing materials on the floor. Inside the cooler were three large trash bags, each of which contained kilogram-sized bricks of compressed marijuana and a piece of paper with numbers written on it. The total weight of the marijuana found was fifty-two pounds. On the table at the back of the garage a triple beam balance scale and commercial digital scale were found with marijuana residue on them. Upstairs, more boxes with fresh marijuana residue, scales, and UPS labels were found, along with shipping boxes. In a corner of this garage, at the bottom of a pile of automobile tires was a metal ammunition canister inside of which were thirty-two knotted plastic bags, each of which contained a chunk of 60 per cent. pure rock cocaine. A five-gallon pail sat against the back wall with ziplock bags containing loose mildewed marijuana and bricks of fresh marijuana. Marijuana buds were found inside unmounted motorcycle tires. A blue plastic tub contained another ziplock bag of fresh, brick marijuana. In a hole in the brick wall was another tub containing marijuana in ten ziplock bags. Small amounts of marijuana, cocaine, and drug paraphernalia were found throughout the house, as well as address books and ATV registrations. When confronted with these findings after his arrest, Keene responded that someone else must have put the drugs in his garage. The jury reasonably found this explanation incredible. Because substantial evidence existed to sustain defendant's convictions, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Instructions and Statements to the Jury</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant challenges both the District Court's instructions as to the government's burden of proof for willful blindness, and its instructions as to what was required to convict Keene of aiding and abetting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of review for a challenge of this type to jury instructions as erroneous is <i>de novo. United States v. Marino,</i> 277 F.3d 11, 28 (1st Cir.2002). A willful-blindness instruction \"is proper if a defendant claims a lack of knowledge, the facts suggest a conscious course of deliberate ignorance, and the instruction, taken as a whole, cannot be misunderstood as mandating an inference of knowledge.\" <i>United States v. Masse,</i> 816 F.2d 805, 812 (1st Cir.1987). As this Court recently pointed out in another drug distribution case, \"whether there was knowledge of drug dealing, or so much awareness that ignorance was willful blindness,\" may turn exclusively on circumstantial evidence. <i>United States v. Corchado-Peralta,</i> 318 F.3d 255, 258 (1st Cir.2003). The District Court instructed members of the jury that they \"may\" infer knowledge from conscious ignorance, not that they were required to do so. <i>See United States v. Bilis,</i> 170 F.3d 88, 92 (1st Cir.1999). The instructions contained a clear explanation of what the jury was required to find in order to determine whether Mr. Keene had been willfully blind to the presence of large quantities of drugs on his property. In particular, the lower court explained that it was \"important to bear in mind that mere negligence or mistake in failing to learn the facts is not sufficient. There must be a deliberate effort to remain ignorant of the fact.\" Jury Instructions at 10(# 32). The instructions gave an accurate statement of the pertinent law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also argues that, because the crime of aiding and abetting was not charged in the indictment, the jury should not have been instructed about it. A defendant may be convicted as an aider and abettor if the evidence shows: (1) that the underlying offense was committed by a principal; (2) that the defendant consciously shared the principal's knowledge; and (3) that he \"willfully associated himself in some way with the crime and willfully participated in it as he would in something he wished to bring about.\" <i>United States v. Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d 92, 109-10 (1st Cir.2003). When asked about the fifty-two pounds of marijuana in his garage, Keene observed, \"It's been there for a while.\" When told he faced serious drug charges, he asked that his girlfriend not be charged, stating \"it's my house, it's my garage.... I guess it's my responsibility.\" He later speculated that \"whoever put the marijuana there must have put the coke there as well.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An instruction on aiding and abetting may be given although there is no reference to the crime in the indictment. <i>United States v. Footman,</i> 215 F.3d 145, 154 (1st Cir.2000). Indeed, a charge of aiding and abetting is implicit in indictments for substantive offenses. <i>Ibid.</i> The revisor's note to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2 states that \"one who puts in motion or assists in the illegal enterprise ... is guilty as a principal even though he intentionally refrained from the direct act constituting the completed offense.\" The instruction was proper, and since it had been given in Keene's first trial, which ended in a mistrial, he cannot claim that the charge came as a surprise to him in the second trial. The instructions on aiding and abetting and willful blindness were proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Prosecutorial Statements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant claims that in its closing argument the government erred in a manner serious enough to require reversal of the jury verdict, both by inviting the jurors to examine handwriting evidence in an improper fashion and by maligning defendant's character. These claims are without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution suggested that jurors could analyze handwriting evidence on numbered labels from drug containers by comparing it with samples of defendant's handwriting to establish a connection between Mr. Keene and the drugs found on his property. Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1731, \"[t]he admitted or proved handwriting of any person shall be admissible, for purposes of comparison, to determine genuineness of other handwriting attributed to such person.\" The trier of fact is authorized to make such a comparison, with or without the benefit of expert testimony. Fed.R.Evid. 901(b)(3). <i>See United States v. Scott,</i> 270 F.3d 30, 49 n. 13 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To emphasize that handwriting comparisons could indeed be performed with only handwritten numbers (rather than letters) for comparison, the prosecution suggested that if jurors themselves wrote the same numbers on a piece of paper and compared them with the samples, they would see that written numbers too were distinctive. Defendant argues that in making this suggestion, the prosecutor asked the jurors to make a determination they were unqualified to make, and encouraged them to create evidence for the purpose of comparison. But the prosecutor merely suggested this mode of comparison and argued for a factual finding favorable to the government. He did not suggest it would be determinative of guilt. The jury was free to disregard the suggestion, especially since other substantial evidence connected Keene to the drugs. The prosecutorial statement did not constitute reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant objects as well to the government's disparaging references in its closing statement to his lifestyle and character. Because this issue is raised for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 105. Mr. Keene must show not only that the arguments were prejudicial and affected his substantial rights, but that, absent reversal, a miscarriage of justice would occur. Mr. Keene draws particular attention to the prosecution's emphasis on the fact that he had drawn workers' compensation for a period of years as an example of the government's attempt to malign his character by implying he was lazy or parasitical. Defendant misconstrues the thrust of this part of the closing argument. The transcript makes clear that the prosecution drew the jury's attention to the fact that Keene was not working a regular job in order to raise a question as to how, without regular income, he was able to afford a luxurious lifestyle. This was an eminently reasonable argument to make, given that it pointed to the likelihood that Mr. Keene's lifestyle was made possible by income from the sale of drugs. The prosecutor's statements were proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Fine and Forfeiture</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that the imposition of a fine of $12,500 by the court, when the pre-sentence investigation report (PSI) recommended against a fine, and the government failed to object to this recommendation, is improper. In these circumstances, we review imposition of a fine for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Cunan,</i> 152 F.3d 29, 37 (1st Cir.1998). <i>Cf. United States v. Thurston,</i> 338 F.3d 50, 77 (1st Cir.)(holding that where a lower court declines to impose a fine when it is mandated by statute, review of questions of law is <i>de novo</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In recommending against a fine, the PSI had made the erroneous assumption that, after forfeiture of his residence, defendant would have no assets left with which to pay a fine. In fact, his known assets, even after forfeiture of his house, totaled over $50,000. The imposition of a fine at the lowest end of the Guideline range is well within judicial discretion, and Keene has not argued that he is unable to pay the amount. Further, the court offered Keene additional time to develop a response to the government's request for a fine at sentencing-time he chose not to use. We find no abuse of discretion in the imposition of a fine here. Whether to impose a fine is the prerogative of the court. That the PSI recommended against a fine, whether or not the recommendation was based on a mistake of fact, cannot be dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having convicted defendant of possession of drugs with intent to distribute, the jury found defendant's residence was forfeit to the government. Defendant asserts that Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2 requires a \"more active and searching inquiry\" than that engaged in by the District Court to justify this forfeiture, and that the government did not meet its burden of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time on appeal, defendant argues that under <i>Apprendi v. New Jersey,</i> 530 U.S. 466, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 147 L.Ed.2d 435 (2000), the applicable standard of proof was proof beyond a reasonable doubt. However, other circuits have consistently refused to apply <i>Apprendi</i> requirements to criminal forfeitures. <i>United States v. Vera,</i> 278 F.3d 672, 673 (7th Cir.2002); <i>United States v. Cabeza,</i> 258 F.3d 1256, 1257 (11th Cir.2001) (<i>per curiam</i>); <i>United States v. Corrado,</i> 227 F.3d 543, 550-51 (6th Cir.2000). The forfeiture is not viewed as a separate charge, but as \"an aspect of punishment imposed following conviction of a substantive offense.\" <i>Cabeza,</i> 258 F.3d at 1257 (quoting <i>Libretti v. United States,</i> 516 U.S. 29, 39, 116 S.Ct. 356, 133 L.Ed.2d 271 (1995)). This is because \"drug trafficking is at the core of the conduct at which the forfeiture statutes are directed.\" <i>United States v. One Clipper Bow Ketch Nisku,</i> 548 F.2d 8, 11 (1st Cir.1977). This Court has observed with approval that \"almost every circuit that has pronounced on the issue has held that the standard of proof as to forfeiture issues under section 853 ... is a preponderance of the evidence.\" <i>United States v. Rogers,</i> 102 F.3d 641, 647 (1st Cir.1996). The evidentiary standard used to impose the forfeiture was proper, as was the forfeiture itself. The preponderance standard was certainly satisfied here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the foregoing reasons, we <i>affirm.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

They immediately found 23 kilograms of compressed marijuana, 3.86 kilograms of loose marijuana, and 890.7 grams of 60 per cent. pure cocaine in a garage adjoining the house, and smaller quantities of drugs along with drug paraphernalia in his house. They arrested Keene and charged him with possession with intent to distribute the drugs. His first trial ended in a mistrial. His second trial was bifurcated, with the forfeiture count severed from the possession with intent to distribute charges. He was convicted by a jury after a motion to suppress evidence obtained during the search was denied. This appeal followed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant raises six issues on appeal. First, he argues that the search warrant obtained by police was not supported by probable cause, because the information relied on was stale and there was no nexus with the property to be searched. Second, there was insufficient evidence of his possession of cocaine with an intent to distribute. Third, the instructions given to the jury on aiding and abetting and willful blindness were not supported by the evidence. Fourth, the prosecution's invitation to the jury to analyze defendant's handwriting was improper and denied him a fair trial. Fifth, the government made references to his lifestyle in its closing argument, which also denied him a fair trial. Finally, the defendant argues that the imposition of a fine was improper, and that the government's request for a forfeiture should have been denied.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>A. Probable Cause</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that Maine Drug Enforcement agents relied on stale information to obtain a nighttime, no-knock warrant for his residence, and that evidence of drug dealing suggested by this information had an inadequate nexus to the property searched.

The task of the reviewing court is to determine whether \"a substantial basis\" existed for the magistrate's determination that probable cause existed. <i>Ibid.</i> Factors to be considered in determining whether a search warrant should issue include \"the value of corroboration of details of an informant's tips by independent police work.\" <i>Id.</i> at 241, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"110959\"><a href=\"/opinion/110959/illinois-v-gates/\"><span class=\"volume\">103</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Maine Drug Enforcement Special Agent Tony L. Milligan obtained this information. The first informant was interviewed in 1992 and provided specific information, while incarcerated, about his drug dealings with six individuals, including defendant, at a Saracens Motorcycle Club hangout. Members of the Saracens had been convicted of drug dealing. Other information provided by this informant had resulted in successful prosecution of significant drug traffickers. Two years later, a second informant, a concerned citizen with no criminal record who was \"sick and tired\" of drug activity connected with the Saracens Motorcycle Club, came forward. He too gave specifics about Keene's drug distribution activities and drug delivery services, and provided eyewitness accounts of his substantial, unexplained wealth. This information was also corroborated. In 1996, a third informant, a convicted felon, also provided information about Keene's drug activities. Finally, a little more than a month before Agent Milligan applied for the search warrant, he received information from Somerset County Sheriff Detective Lt. Carl Gottardi about his interview with a highly reliable source, who was charged with no crime and was not paid for his information. This informant recounted first-hand observations of Keene's large-scale cocaine sales, and indicated that Keene also supplied drugs to the Saracens and Hell's Angels Motorcycle Clubs. In the month leading up to application for the warrant, this informant identified one of Keene's regular cocaine customers and provided details about Keene's habits which police corroborated.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Since the information provided by the four informants over a ten-year period was amply corroborated, was consistent with a drug conspiracy of long duration, and had been updated within the month before application for the warrant, there was probable cause for issuance of the warrant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant also argues that the information provided did not establish a sufficient nexus between drug activity and the property to be searched, and so the warrant should not have issued. <i>See United States v. Lalor,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"610588\"><a href=\"/opinion/610588/united-states-v-john-lalor/\"><span class=\"volume\">996</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1578</span></a></span>, 1582 (4th Cir.1993). However, the informants provided information about drug sales by defendant, evidence of substantial wealth unexplained by his workers' compensation benefits, and the fact that he worked from home while recovering from back injuries for which he drew the workers' compensation. This information suggested that drug distribution was being organized from Keene's residence, a place which was safe and accessible. <i>United States v. Feliz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"764988\"><a href=\"/opinion/764988/united-states-v-yanokura-f-eliz/\"><span class=\"volume\">182</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">82</span></a></span>, 87-88 (1st Cir.1999).

To determine whether evidence was sufficient, \"we examine the record in a light most favorable to the government, drawing all reasonable inferences in its favor, with an eye towards whether the proof would have allowed a rational jury to determine beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant was guilty of the crime charged.\" <i>Ibid.</i> (quoting <i>United States v.

Both direct and circumstantial evidence are considered, and the government's proof may lie \"<i>entirely</i> in circumstantial evidence.\" <i>Ibid.</i> Defendant argues that the drugs found by police at his home were found in a garage bay to which many people had access, and that the government supplied no substantial evidence of sales of drugs by Keene.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When twenty officers executed the search warrant, after arresting Keene, his girlfriend, and his father, they searched defendant's garages. On entering the first garage, Agent Milligan was overwhelmed by the strong odor of fresh marijuana, and immediately noticed a large white cooler and packing materials on the floor. Inside the cooler were three large trash bags, each of which contained kilogram-sized bricks of compressed marijuana and a piece of paper with numbers written on it. The total weight of the marijuana found was fifty-two pounds. On the table at the back of the garage a triple beam balance scale and commercial digital scale were found with marijuana residue on them. Upstairs, more boxes with fresh marijuana residue, scales, and UPS labels were found, along with shipping boxes. In a corner of this garage, at the bottom of a pile of automobile tires was a metal ammunition canister inside of which were thirty-two knotted plastic bags, each of which contained a chunk of 60 per cent. pure rock cocaine. A five-gallon pail sat against the back wall with ziplock bags containing loose mildewed marijuana and bricks of fresh marijuana. Marijuana buds were found inside unmounted motorcycle tires. A blue plastic tub contained another ziplock bag of fresh, brick marijuana. In a hole in the brick wall was another tub containing marijuana in ten ziplock bags. Small amounts of marijuana, cocaine, and drug paraphernalia were found throughout the house, as well as address books and ATV registrations. When confronted with these findings after his arrest, Keene responded that someone else must have put the drugs in his garage. The jury reasonably found this explanation incredible. Because substantial evidence existed to sustain defendant's convictions, we affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>C. Instructions and Statements to the Jury</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant challenges both the District Court's instructions as to the government's burden of proof for willful blindness, and its instructions as to what was required to convict Keene of aiding and abetting.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The standard of review for a challenge of this type to jury instructions as erroneous is <i>de novo. United States v. Marino,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199776\"><a href=\"/opinion/199776/united-states-v-marino/\"><span class=\"volume\">277</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">11</span></a></span>, 28 (1st Cir.2002). A willful-blindness instruction \"is proper if a defendant claims a lack of knowledge, the facts suggest a conscious course of deliberate ignorance, and the instruction, taken as a whole, cannot be misunderstood as mandating an inference of knowledge.\" <i>United States v. Masse,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"487126\"><a href=\"/opinion/487126/united-states-v-stephen-o-masse/\"><span class=\"volume\">816</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">805</span></a></span>, 812 (1st Cir.1987). As this Court recently pointed out in another drug distribution case, \"whether there was knowledge of drug dealing, or so much awareness that ignorance was willful blindness,\" may turn exclusively on circumstantial evidence. <i>United States v. Corchado-Peralta,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200312\"><a href=\"/opinion/200312/united-states-v-corchardo-peralta/\"><span class=\"volume\">318</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">255</span></a></span>, 258 (1st Cir.2003). The District Court instructed members of the jury that they \"may\" infer knowledge from conscious ignorance, not that they were required to do so. <i>See United States v. Bilis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198368\"><a href=\"/opinion/198368/united-states-v-bilis/\"><span class=\"volume\">170</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">88</span></a></span>, 92 (1st Cir.1999). The instructions contained a clear explanation of what the jury was required to find in order to determine whether Mr. Keene had been willfully blind to the presence of large quantities of drugs on his property. In particular, the lower court explained that it was \"important to bear in mind that mere negligence or mistake in failing to learn the facts is not sufficient. There must be a deliberate effort to remain ignorant of the fact.\" Jury Instructions at 10(# 32). The instructions gave an accurate statement of the pertinent law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Appellant also argues that, because the crime of aiding and abetting was not charged in the indictment, the jury should not have been instructed about it. A defendant may be convicted as an aider and abettor if the evidence shows: (1) that the underlying offense was committed by a principal; (2) that the defendant consciously shared the principal's knowledge; and (3) that he \"willfully associated himself in some way with the crime and willfully participated in it as he would in something he wished to bring about.\" <i>United States v. Henderson,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200345\"><a href=\"/opinion/200345/united-states-v-henderson/\"><span class=\"volume\">320</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 109-10 (1st Cir.2003). When asked about the fifty-two pounds of marijuana in his garage, Keene observed, \"It's been there for a while.\" When told he faced serious drug charges, he asked that his girlfriend not be charged, stating \"it's my house, it's my garage.... I guess it's my responsibility.\" He later speculated that \"whoever put the marijuana there must have put the coke there as well.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An instruction on aiding and abetting may be given although there is no reference to the crime in the indictment. <i>United States v. Footman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198968\"><a href=\"/opinion/198968/united-states-v-footman/\"><span class=\"volume\">215</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">145</span></a></span>, 154 (1st Cir.2000). Indeed, a charge of aiding and abetting is implicit in indictments for substantive offenses. <i>Ibid.</i> The revisor's note to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2 states that \"one who puts in motion or assists in the illegal enterprise ... is guilty as a principal even though he intentionally refrained from the direct act constituting the completed offense.\" The instruction was proper, and since it had been given in Keene's first trial, which ended in a mistrial, he cannot claim that the charge came as a surprise to him in the second trial. The instructions on aiding and abetting and willful blindness were proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>D. Prosecutorial Statements</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant claims that in its closing argument the government erred in a manner serious enough to require reversal of the jury verdict, both by inviting the jurors to examine handwriting evidence in an improper fashion and by maligning defendant's character. These claims are without merit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The prosecution suggested that jurors could analyze handwriting evidence on numbered labels from drug containers by comparing it with samples of defendant's handwriting to establish a connection between Mr. Keene and the drugs found on his property. Under 28 U.S.C. &#167; 1731, \"[t]he admitted or proved handwriting of any person shall be admissible, for purposes of comparison, to determine genuineness of other handwriting attributed to such person.\" The trier of fact is authorized to make such a comparison, with or without the benefit of expert testimony. Fed.R.Evid. 901(b)(3). <i>See United States v. Scott,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"775404\"><a href=\"/opinion/775404/united-states-v-alan-n-scott/\"><span class=\"volume\">270</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 49 n. 13 (1st Cir.2001).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To emphasize that handwriting comparisons could indeed be performed with only handwritten numbers (rather than letters) for comparison, the prosecution suggested that if jurors themselves wrote the same numbers on a piece of paper and compared them with the samples, they would see that written numbers too were distinctive. Defendant argues that in making this suggestion, the prosecutor asked the jurors to make a determination they were unqualified to make, and encouraged them to create evidence for the purpose of comparison. But the prosecutor merely suggested this mode of comparison and argued for a factual finding favorable to the government. He did not suggest it would be determinative of guilt. The jury was free to disregard the suggestion, especially since other substantial evidence connected Keene to the drugs. The prosecutorial statement did not constitute reversible error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant objects as well to the government's disparaging references in its closing statement to his lifestyle and character. Because this issue is raised for the first time on appeal, we review only for plain error. <i>Henderson,</i> 320 F.3d at 105. Mr. Keene must show not only that the arguments were prejudicial and affected his substantial rights, but that, absent reversal, a miscarriage of justice would occur. Mr. Keene draws particular attention to the prosecution's emphasis on the fact that he had drawn workers' compensation for a period of years as an example of the government's attempt to malign his character by implying he was lazy or parasitical. Defendant misconstrues the thrust of this part of the closing argument. The transcript makes clear that the prosecution drew the jury's attention to the fact that Keene was not working a regular job in order to raise a question as to how, without regular income, he was able to afford a luxurious lifestyle. This was an eminently reasonable argument to make, given that it pointed to the likelihood that Mr. Keene's lifestyle was made possible by income from the sale of drugs. The prosecutor's statements were proper.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>E. Fine and Forfeiture</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Defendant argues that the imposition of a fine of $12,500 by the court, when the pre-sentence investigation report (PSI) recommended against a fine, and the government failed to object to this recommendation, is improper. In these circumstances, we review imposition of a fine for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Cunan,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198097\"><a href=\"/opinion/198097/united-states-v-cunan/\"><span class=\"volume\">152</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">29</span></a></span>, 37 (1st Cir.1998). <i>Cf.

Thurston,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">338</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">50</span></span>, 77 (1st Cir.)(holding that where a lower court declines to impose a fine when it is mandated by statute, review of questions of law is <i>de novo</i>).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In recommending against a fine, the PSI had made the erroneous assumption that, after forfeiture of his residence, defendant would have no assets left with which to pay a fine. In fact, his known assets, even after forfeiture of his house, totaled over $50,000. The imposition of a fine at the lowest end of the Guideline range is well within judicial discretion, and Keene has not argued that he is unable to pay the amount. Further, the court offered Keene additional time to develop a response to the government's request for a fine at sentencing-time he chose not to use. We find no abuse of discretion in the imposition of a fine here. Whether to impose a fine is the prerogative of the court. That the PSI recommended against a fine, whether or not the recommendation was based on a mistake of fact, cannot be dispositive.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having convicted defendant of possession of drugs with intent to distribute, the jury found defendant's residence was forfeit to the government. Defendant asserts that Fed.R.Crim.P. 32.2 requires a \"more active and searching inquiry\" than that engaged in by the District Court to justify this forfeiture, and that the government did not meet its burden of proof.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the first time on appeal, defendant argues that under <i>Apprendi v.
