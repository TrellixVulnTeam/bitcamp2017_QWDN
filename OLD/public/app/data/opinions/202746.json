This appeal arises out of a\n\ntrademark dispute between Colt Defense LLC (Colt) and Bushmaster\n\nFirearms, Inc. (Bushmaster) over Bushmaster's use of the term \"M4\"\n\nin conjunction with its sale of certain firearms.                     The district\n\ncourt concluded that the term was generic and not entitled to\n\ntrademark protection.        We affirm.\n\n                                       I.\n\n                 In 1959, Colt purchased the right to develop the\n\nArmalite Rifle model 15 (AR-15), a small-caliber, gas-operated\n\ncarbine rifle initially developed at the Armalite Division of\n\nFairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation.               Colt sold a variant of\n\nthe   AR-15     to   the   United    States      military,     which    eventually\n\ndesignated it as the M16.1\n\n              In the early 1980s, the military determined that it\n\nneeded a more compact version of the M16. Colt originally designed\n\nthe prototype for this new weapon under a 1985 contract with the\n\nmilitary   in    which     Colt   agreed   to    build   and   test    forty   \"XM4\n\nCarbines.\"2     In 1990, the military entered into an agreement with\n\nBushmaster to provide sixty-five carbines \"having all the physical\n\nand technical characteristics of the M4 Carbine.\"\n\n\n      1\n      The \"M\" designation system is used by the military to\nidentify one piece in a series of various sorts of equipment, e.g.\nfirearms, tanks. \"M\" stands for model, with each new version in\nthe series receiving a sequential number.\n      2\n      The \"X\" before \"M\" means that the piece is experimental and\nhas not been officially classified.\n\n                                       -2-\n\f          In 1994, the military designated the new compact version\n\nof the M16 carbine as the M4.       This was the latest in a series of\n\ncarbine designations beginning with the M1 in 1940.               The M4\n\ncharacteristics were derived from the XM4 prototype designed by\n\nColt. The M4 is a lightweight, gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-\n\nfed, selective-rate-of-fire carbine with a collapsible stock.          It\n\nshares about eighty percent commonality with the M16.\n\n          An intellectual property dispute arose between Colt and\n\nthe military in the mid 1990's.     Colt claimed that the military had\n\nbreached a licensing agreement concerning the technology for the\n\nM16 by disclosing proprietary information to third parties.            As\n\npart of the settlement of this dispute, the military and Colt\n\nexecuted the 1997 \"M4 Carbine Addendum to Technical Data Sales and\n\nPatent License Agreement\" (Addendum).          The Addendum recognized\n\nColt's right to the proprietary information incorporated in the M4\n\ncarbine design and defined the term \"M4 Carbine\" to mean \"the\n\ncompact carbine designed by Colt, 5.56mm, having a 14.5\" barrel,\n\nwith a telescoping buttstock, that is capable of firing in the\n\nsemi-automatic   and   or   three    round   bursts,   defined   in   U.S.\n\nGovernment specification MIL-C-70559 . . . .\" The design set forth\n\nin MIL-C-70559 was deemed proprietary to Colt and, as part of the\n\nAddendum, the military designated Colt as its sole supplier of M4s\n\nuntil 2011.\n\n\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\f           Outside of the military context, Colt and Bushmaster have\n\nlong competed in the sale of carbines.              Bushmaster is the leading\n\nproducer of carbines for the United States commercial and law-\n\nenforcement markets, while Colt is the leading supplier to the U.S.\n\nmilitary but also sells to foreign governments, law enforcement\n\nagencies, and the public.\n\n           Colt and Bushmaster each use the term \"M4\" in marketing\n\nversions of their carbines.           Bushmaster began using M4 in its\n\nadvertising in 1991 and has since done so continuously.                    In 1997,\n\nBushmaster    began    to    refer   to     the   \"M4    type\"    weapon    in   its\n\nadvertising \"to avoid possible confusion.\"3              Colt has also used       M4\n\ncontinuously in its advertising since at least 1992 and registered\n\nM4 on the Principal Register of the Patent and Trademark Office in\n\n2001. Other carbine manufacturers, including Heckler & Koch, Inc.,\n\nalso use M4 in their advertising.\n\n           In 2004, Colt filed an action in the United States\n\nDistrict   Court     for    the   Eastern    District     of   Virginia     against\n\nBushmaster and Heckler & Koch for, inter alia, infringing on its M4\n\nmark in violation of the Lanham Act.              See 15 U.S.C. ยง 1051 et seq.\n\nBushmaster, a Maine-based company, successfully moved to have the\n\nclaims against it severed and transferred to the United States\n\nDistrict     Court    for     the    District       of   Maine.       Bushmaster\n\n\n\n     3\n      The record does not include an explanation of the sort of\n\"confusion\" this modification is intended to avoid.\n\n                                       -4-\n\fcounterclaimed for the cancellation of Colt's registration of the\n\nM4 mark.    See id. ยง 1064.\n\n            Heckler & Koch settled with Colt. In the settlement\n\nagreement, Heckler & Koch was not required to pay Colt any money\n\nbut acknowledged \"that Colt owns the M4 trademark and agrees that\n\nColt's M4 trademark is a valid and enforceable trademark that\n\nshould not be cancelled on the grounds of genericness.\"\n\n            Bushmaster did not settle and, in due course, moved for\n\nsummary    judgment   on   Colt's    infringement    claim    and   its   own\n\ncancellation counterclaim. The motion was assigned to a magistrate\n\njudge,     who   recommended    granting     Bushmaster's    motion.      The\n\nmagistrate judge concluded that the undisputed evidence established\n\nthat M4 was a generic term for a class of carbines and therefore\n\ncould not be trademarked by Colt.          Colt objected, but the district\n\ncourt adopted the recommendation without opinion.            Colt appealed.\n\n                                     II.\n\n             We review the district court's grant of summary judgment\n\nde novo.     See Calvi v. Knox County, 470 F.3d 422, 426 (1st Cir.\n\n2006).     In so doing, we take as true the facts documented in the\n\nrecord below, resolving any factual conflicts or disparities in\n\nfavor of the nonmovant.        See Mulvihill v. Top-Flite Golf Co., 335\n\nF.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2003).        A grant of summary judgment will be\n\nupheld if, after construing the record favorably to the nonmoving\n\nparty, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the\n\n\n                                     -5-\n\fmoving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.            See Fed.\n\nR. Civ. P. 56(c).\n\n            The purpose of a trademark is to identify and distinguish\n\nthe goods of one party from those of another.              See 15 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1127.   To the purchasing public, a trademark \"signi[fies] that all\n\ngoods bearing the trademark\" originated from the same source and\n\nthat \"all goods bearing the trademark are of an equal level of\n\nquality.\"   1 J. Thomas McCarthy, McCarthy on Trademarks and Unfair\n\nCompetition ยง 3:2 (2007) [hereinafter McCarthy].\n\n            A   proposed   mark   cannot   acquire    trademark   protection\n\nunless the mark is distinctive, that is, unless it serves the\n\npurpose of identifying the source of the goods.          Two Pesos, Inc. v.\n\nTaco Cabana, Inc., 505 U.S. 763, 768 (1997).          The Supreme Court has\n\ndivided marks into five categories of distinctiveness: (1) generic,\n\n(2) descriptive, (3) suggestive, (4) arbitrary, or (5) fanciful.\n\nSee id. (citing Abercrombie & Fitch Co. v. Hunting World, Inc., 537\n\nF.2d 4, 9 (2d Cir. 1976) (Friendly, J.)).            The further along this\n\nspectrum a term falls, the more likely it is to receive trademark\n\nprotection.     Id.\n\n            Generic terms, being the least distinctive, receive no\n\ntrademark protection.      See Park 'N Fly, Inc. v. Dollar Park & Fly,\n\nInc., 469 U.S. 189, 193-94 (1985); I.P. Lund Trading ApS v. Kohler\n\nCo., 163 F.3d 27, 39 (1st Cir. 1998).        \"A generic term is one that\n\ndoes not distinguish the goods of one producer from the goods of\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\fothers.   Instead, it is one that either by definition or through\n\ncommon use has come to be understood as referring to the genus of\n\nwhich the particular product is a species.\"           Keebler Co. v. Rovira\n\nBiscuit Corp., 624 F.2d 366, 373-74 (1st Cir. 1980)(internal\n\nquotations omitted).      Stated differently, a generic term answers\n\nthe question \"What are you?\" while a mark answers the question\n\n\"Where do you come from?\"          McCarthy ยง 12:1.      For a term to be\n\ngeneric, then, its \"primary significance . . . to the relevant\n\npublic\" must be to identify the nature of a good, rather than its\n\nsource.   15 U.S.C. ยง 1064(3); Magic Wand, Inc. v. RDB, Inc., 940\n\nF.2d 638, 641 (Fed. Cir. 1991).\n\n          Where, as here, the party claiming infringement has\n\nregistered the term on the Principal Register, the registration\n\nestablishes a rebuttable presumption that the term is not generic.\n\n15 U.S.C. ยง 1115(a); Door Sys. Inc. v. Pro-Line Door Sys., Inc., 83\n\nF.3d 169, 172 (7th Cir. 1996); Keebler, 624 F.2d at 373.                 This\n\npresumption    may   be   overcome      where   the     alleged     infringer\n\ndemonstrates   genericness    by    a   preponderance    of   the   evidence.\n\nKeebler, 624 F.2d at 373; see also Yellow Cab Co. of Sacramento v.\n\nYellow Cab of Elk Grove, Inc., 419 F.3d 925, 929 (9th Cir. 2005);\n\nPizzeria Uno Corp. v. Temple, 747 F.2d 1522, 1529 n.4 (4th Cir.\n\n1984). \"In deciding genericness, evidence of the relevant public's\n\nunderstanding of a term may by obtained from any competent source.\"\n\nSchwan's IP, LLC v. Kraft Pizza Co., 460 F.3d 971, 974 (8th Cir.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f2006) (internal quotations omitted). Such sources include consumer\n\nsurveys, e.g., Keebler, 624 F.2d at 375, the use of the term in\n\nmedia publications, e.g., Murphy Door Bed Co. v. Interior Sleep\n\nSys., Inc., 874 F.2d 95, 101 (2d Cir. 1989), use of the term by\n\ncompetitors in the industry, e.g., Schwan's, 460 F.3d at 975,\n\npurchaser testimony concerning the term, e.g., In re Merrill Lynch,\n\nPierce, Fenner, and Smith, Inc., 828 F.2d 1567, 1570 (Fed. Cir.\n\n1987), and the plaintiff's   use of the term, Retailer Servs., Inc.\n\nv. Freebies Publ'g, 364 F.3d 535, 544 (4th Cir. 2004).\n\n            With this background, we consider the record evidence\n\nsupporting Bushmaster's contention that M4 is generic.   There are\n\nseveral examples of media publications using M4 in a generic\n\nfashion.4   For example, an article appearing on a website called\n\nquarterbore.com described the \"M4 Carbine [as] like the M16 but .\n\n. . more compact and featur[ing] a collapsible stock.\"        This\n\narticle, and several similar ones, refer to the M4 as a type of\n\ncarbine with certain characteristics, not a brand of carbine sold\n\nby a certain producer, and therefore support a determination of\n\ngenericness. See Murphy Door Bed, 874 F.2d at 101 (concluding that\n\nevidence of \"numerous examples of newspaper and magazine use of the\n\nphrase Murphy bed to describe generally a type of bed\" indicated\n\ngenericness).    In addition, there are several articles in the\n\n\n     4\n      Bushmaster did not submit a consumer survey to support its\nclaim but such evidence, while \"desirable\" to establish\ngenericness, is not required. Keebler, 624 F.2d at 375.\n\n                                -8-\n\frecord that review and compare M4 carbines made by different\n\nproducers.         Consistent    with   generic       use,   these    articles\n\npredominantly refer to the name of the manufacturer as the source\n\nidentifier for an M4-type weapon, e.g., \"Bushmaster M4A1,\" \"Colt\n\nM4A1,\" \"Rock River M4.\"\n\n           There is also evidence demonstrating that the term M4 is\n\nused by several of Colt's competitors in their advertising.                This\n\nevidence is probative of generic use because \"[t]he more members of\n\nthe public see a term used by competitors in the field, the less\n\nlikely they will be to identify the term with one particular\n\nproducer.\" Classic Foods Int'l Corp. v. Kettle Foods, Inc., 468 F.\n\nSupp. 2d 1181, 11190 (C.D. Cal. 2007).                 Recently, the Eighth\n\nCircuit affirmed a summary judgment ruling that the term \"brick\n\noven\" was generic as used to describe pizza.           Schwan's, 460 F.3d at\n\n971.    To support its ruling, the court identified four other\n\nretailers that described their product as \"brick oven pizza.\"               Id.\n\nat 975.   While there may be differences between the import of the\n\nterms \"M4\" and \"brick oven pizza,\" the relevance of competitor\n\nusage to our inquiry is the same.       And here, the record evidence is\n\neven    stronger    than   in    Schwan's    --   at    least    fifteen    gun\n\nmanufacturers use M4 to describe their products.\n\n           Undisputed information from purchasers of carbines also\n\nsupports the conclusion that M4 is generic.              The record includes\n\nemail   messages    sent   to   Bushmaster   by   a    variety   of   consumers\n\n\n                                     -9-\n\frepresenting civilian, law enforcement, and miliary purchasers.\n\nThe emails use M4 as a generic descriptor.   Some of the emails are\n\nfrom customers asking Bushmaster for the price of its M4 and\n\ninformation concerning shipment of its M4. These customers use the\n\nphrase M4 to describe the type of gun that they hope to purchase,\n\nnot to identify the manufacturer of the gun.   Cf. Glover v. Ampak,\n\nInc., 74 F.3d 57, 59 (4th Cir. 1996) (stating that genericness can\n\nbe shown by evidence showing that a purchaser entering a store uses\n\na term to mean any brand of a particular item rather than the brand\n\nmade by a single company).\n\n          Finally, there is evidence, albeit limited, that Colt\n\nitself has used M4 generically.   Generic use by the party seeking\n\ntrademark protection is relevant because \"[a] kind of estoppel\n\narises when the proponent of [a] trademark use is proven to have\n\nitself used the term before the public as a generic name . . . .\"\n\nMcCarthy ยง 12:13.   The record contains a Colt document using the\n\nterm M4 to describe a type of carbine.       Specifically, a patent\n\napplication filed by a Colt employee referred to \"M4 type rifles\n\nand carbines\" (emphasis added).       See Pilates, Inc. v. Current\n\nConcepts, Inc., 120 F. Supp. 2d 286, 299 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (use of\n\nchallenged term to describe a product in a generic way by the party\n\nclaiming infringement can suggest that a term is generic); Birtcher\n\nElectro Med. Sys., Inc. v. Beacon Labs., Inc., 738 F. Supp. 417,\n\n420-21 (D. Colo. 1990) (similar).\n\n\n                               -10-\n\f             In sum, Bushmaster presented sufficient evidence to rebut\n\nthe presumption that Colt's mark is not generic.          Moreover, this\n\nevidence     if   undisputed,   would   entitle   Bushmaster    to   summary\n\njudgment     on   Colt's   infringement   claim   and   its    cancellation\n\ncounterclaim.5 Colt contends, however, that the evidence submitted\n\nby Bushmaster was misinterpreted and overvalued, and that other\n\nevidence that would create a genuine issue of material fact was\n\nignored.      We first consider Colt's challenges to the evidence\n\nrelied on by Bushmaster and then consider the evidence that Colt\n\ncontends was ignored.\n\n             Colt claims first that the evidence concerning media\n\npublications is not particularly useful in the genericness inquiry\n\nand therefore should have been accorded \"limited significance.\" In\n\nsupport of this proposition, it relies on a dictum from the Third\n\nCircuit that use of a term in trade journals to show generic use\n\nmay be \"problematic.\"       Berner Int'l Corp. v. Mars Sales Co., 987\n\nF.2d 975, 983 (3d Cir. 1993).      The Third Circuit's concern related\n\nto the use of trade publications that are directed to producers of\n\na product.    The court explained that the use of these materials was\n\n\"problematic\" because \"[a]rticles in trade journals may indicate\n\n\n     5\n      Colt does not dispute that a conclusion that M4 is generic as\na matter of law would support a summary judgment ruling in\nBushmaster's favor on the infringement claim and cancellation\ncounterclaim.    See McCarthy ยง 20:56 (\"A registration can be\ncancelled at any time if the registered mark becomes the generic\nname for the good or services, or a portion thereof, for which it\nis registered.\").\n\n                                   -11-\n\fwhat a term means to the producer but not what it means to the\n\nrelevant consuming public.\" Id. Here, however, the articles cited\n\nby   Bushmaster   to   show   generic   use   were   articles   written   for\n\nconsumers, not producers.6       Thus, the concern expressed in Berner\n\nhas no application because the articles relied on by Bushmaster do\n\nshow the meaning of M4 to the relevant consuming public.7\n\n           Colt next challenges Bushmaster's reliance on purchaser\n\ntestimony.   As mentioned above, this evidence consisted of several\n\ncommunications from customers to Bushmaster in which they asked\n\nBushmaster questions about its M4 carbine.           Colt asserts that this\n\nevidence does not show generic use of M4 but rather purchaser\n\nconfusion.   It contends that these purchasers could be understood\n\nto have used M4 as a replacement for the name \"Colt\" and were\n\ndemonstrating that they were confused about the source of the gun.\n\nThis is not a reasonable inference from the evidence.             See Nat'l\n\n\n      6\n      In addition to the \"quarterbore\" website discussed above,\nBushmaster relied on articles from Soldier of Fortune, Special\nWeapons, Gun & Weapons for Law Enfrocement and Shotgun News. These\nare all consumer-oriented publications.\n      7\n      Colt also criticizes the reliance on Bushmaster's publication\nevidence on the ground that the magistrate judge's analysis\ncontained an internal inconsistency.     According to Colt, it is\nimpossible to reconcile the magistrate judge's observation that the\nrecord contains numerous articles that identify M4 \"as a Colt\nproduct\" with his ultimate conclusion that the publication evidence\nsupported genericness. This was not a contradiction at all. The\nmagistrate judge meant that several articles used M4 to describe\nColt's product in the same manner that M4 was used to describe\nother competitors' products, viz., along with the name of the\nproducer (e.g. the \"Rock River M4\"/the \"Colt M4\"). As discussed\nearlier, this type of usage supports a finding of genericness.\n\n                                   -12-\n\fAmusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham, 43 F.3d 731, 743 (1st Cir.\n\n1995) (\"a court pondering a Rule 56 motion need not embrace\n\ninferences that are wildly improbable or that rely on tenuous\n\ninsinuation\"). These purchasers intentionally directed their email\n\ncommunications about purchasing M4s to Bushmaster at Bushmaster's\n\nwebsite; there is nothing to suggest that, in asking Bushmaster\n\nabout an M4 that it was selling, these purchasers thought that they\n\nwere asking Colt about a weapon that it was selling or were asking\n\nBushmaster about a Colt product.\n\n               Turning     to        the    evidence      that   Colt    contends         was\n\noverlooked,    we   begin       with       Colt's    registration       of    M4   on     the\n\nPrincipal Register.        Colt claims that its successful registration\n\nis a fact that, by itself, defeats Bushmaster's summary judgment\n\nmotion.      This   is    so,    according          to   Colt,   because      even   after\n\nBushmaster    put   forward          evidence       to   rebut   the    presumption        of\n\nvalidity     established        by    the     registration,       \"the       registration\n\ncontinued to serve as strong evidence that the trademark is not\n\ngeneric in the eyes of the relevant public.\"\n\n           Colt's        argument          overstates     the    significance        of     a\n\nregistered mark.         As stated above, a registered mark serves to\n\nestablish a rebuttable presumption that the mark is subject to\n\ntrademark protection.            Borinquen v. Biscuit Corp. M.V. Trading\n\nCorp., 443 F.3d 112, 117-18 (1st Cir. 2006).                      However, once this\n\npresumption has been overcome, the party holding the certificate of\n\n\n                                             -13-\n\fregistration may not avoid summary judgment simply by pointing to\n\nthe certificate as evidence.      See Retail Servs., 364 F.3d at 543-\n\n44; Natron Corp. v. STMicroelectronics, Inc., 305 F.3d 397, 405\n\n(6th Cir. 2002);    Tie Tech, Inc. v. Kinedyne Corp., 296 F.3d 778,\n\n784 (9th Cir. 2002); Liquid Controls Corp. v. Liquid Control Corp.,\n\n802 F.2d 934, 937 n.2 (7th Cir. 1986).\n\n            Colt relies on the Fourth Circuit's decision in America\n\nOnline, Inc. v. AT&T Corp. 243 F.3d 812 (4th Cir. 2001), for the\n\nproposition that proof of registration is, by itself, adequate to\n\ndefeat a summary judgment motion.        But America Online \"nowhere\n\nsuggested   that   registration   created   a   per   se   issue   of   fact\n\nsufficient to defeat summary judgment.\" Retail Servs., 364 F.3d at\n\n543.   The certificate of registration was sufficient to defeat\n\nsummary judgment in America Online only because the plaintiff\n\nsubmitted \"other evidence\" that the mark was not generic. Id.; see\n\nalso Tie Tech, 296 F.3d at 784 (concluding that America Online does\n\nnot stand for the proposition that \"registration itself would\n\nalways raise a material issue of fact\").\n\n            Colt next asserts that summary judgment was improper,\n\nbecause there was evidence that the military associates the term M4\n\nwith Colt and that, based on this evidence, a reasonable factfinder\n\ncould conclude that M4 is not generic.          Colt contends that this\n\nevidence was incorrectly excluded, because its exclusion was based\n\non the court's erroneous view that the military's understanding was\n\n\n                                  -14-\n\firrelevant because \"it was not among the classes of purchasers who\n\nare free to choose among the products of competing manufacturers.\"\n\n          We agree with Colt that it would be incorrect to exclude\n\nevidence of the military's understanding of the term M4 simply\n\nbecause it had a sole-source contract with Colt and therefore could\n\nnot purchase the weapon elsewhere. The test for genericness is the\n\n\"primary significance of the mark to the relevant public.\"                 15\n\nU.S.C. ยง 1064(3) (emphasis added).       Sometimes, the relevant public\n\nwill not be the potential purchasing public as a whole but rather\n\n\"a relatively small group of highly trained and knowledgeable\n\ncustomers.\"   Nartron Corp., 305 F.3d at 406.           The military is, of\n\ncourse, a significant and sophisticated participant in the carbine-\n\npurchasing market, and we know of no trademark law principle that\n\nrenders its understanding of the meaning of M4 inadmissible simply\n\nbecause it was under contract to buy exclusively from Colt.\n\n          But that evidence should be considered does not mean that\n\nit carries enough weight to create a triable issue.            Colt relies\n\nprimarily on the Addendum to show that the military associates the\n\nterm M4 with Colt and points specifically to the provision of the\n\nAddendum that provides that the M4 is a carbine \"designed by Colt.\"\n\n          The   Addendum   does   not    provide   an    opinion   from   the\n\nmilitary that it believed that M4 was a term associated with Colt.\n\nThe Addendum memorialized a procurement arrangement negotiated\n\nbetween Colt and the military to resolve an intellectual property\n\n\n                                  -15-\n\fdispute.        The   military    could   have     contracted    with   multiple\n\nproducers or given a sole-source contract to another producer to\n\nprovide it with M4s.           Indeed, in 1990, the military did so by\n\ncontracting with Bushmaster for M4s.\n\n            At bottom, the Addendum is merely evidence of a business\n\nrelationship of a limited duration between Colt and the military;\n\nit   is   not   evidence    of    the   military's     general    and   enduring\n\nunderstanding of the meaning of M4 outside of the contractual\n\nrelationship.         The genericness inquiry is \"concerned with the\n\ncommon use of language,\" McCarthy ยง 12:4, not the defined terms in\n\na negotiated contract between the trademark holder and a third\n\nparty.8    Indeed, there is every possibility that the military will\n\ncontract with another producer to build M4s in 2011, when the\n\nAddendum's      sole-source      provision     expires.     If    the   Addendum\n\nsupported a non-generic finding and the military does change\n\nsuppliers in 2011, it could lead to the absurd result of the\n\nmilitary being prevented from identifying the weapon by use of the\n\nvery classification system that it originally have devised.\n\n            Colt next points to Heckler & Koch's settlement of Colt's\n\ninfringement      claim   as   evidence      of   non-generic    use.    In   the\n\nsettlement (which did not require Heckler & Koch to pay any money),\n\n\n\n      8\n      We further observe that terms within an agreement are often\ndefined for the very reason that the common use of a term does not\naccurately capture the parties' intended meaning for purposes of\nthe relationship.\n\n                                        -16-\n\fHeckler & Koch stated \"that Colt owns the M4 trademark and agrees\n\nthat Colt's M4 trademark is a valid and enforceable trademark that\n\nshould not be cancelled on the grounds of genericness.\"              This\n\nstatement is not probative for the same basic reason as the\n\nevidence concerning the Addendum: it is not evidence of the common\n\nuse of M4.   It is evidence that Heckler & Koch agreed to a legal\n\nconclusion for which Colt negotiated.       For obvious reasons, such\n\nevidence   has   little,   if   anything,   to   do   with   the   general\n\nunderstanding of M4 to the relevant public.9\n\n           Finally, Colt contends that evidence that there are\n\nwords other than M4 to designate the product at issue was ignored.\n\nAccording to Colt, such evidence is probative of non-generic use\n\nbecause the existence of other suitable identifiers suggest that M4\n\nis not a name for a type of gun but rather is an identifier of the\n\nbrand of gun.     Colt argues that the words carbine, rifle, and\n\nfirearm are adequate alternative descriptors of the M4.\n\n           This argument is misplaced.       The M4 is a lightweight,\n\ngas-operated,    air-cooled,    magazine-fed,    selective-rate-of-fire\n\n\n     9\n      Colt also contends that Bushmaster \"implicitly acknowledged\"\nthat M4 is a non-generic term by agreeing in 1997 to use the term\nM4-type \"to reduce confusion.\" As we noted earlier, supra note 3,\nthe record contains neither an explanation of the type of confusion\nthat Bushmaster sought to reduce nor other evidence concerning\nBushmaster's decisions to refer to the M4-type weapon (although one\npossible inference is that the reason was that it would be illegal\nto sell an automatic M4 to the public). In any event, it would be\npure speculation to conclude that this is evidence of Bushmaster's\nunderstanding that M4 was not a generic term; the evidence adds\nlittle to Colt's case.\n\n                                  -17-\n\fweapon with a collapsible stock.               Colt has identified no word,\n\nother than M4, that captures these characteristics.                 The closest\n\nterm Colt identifies is \"carbine,\" but carbine means only a \"short-\n\nbarreled lightweight rifle.\"           Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary\n\n335 (1993).       It does not capture the several characteristics that\n\ncomprise an M4.\n\n               To summarize, Colt was integral to the development of the\n\ntechnology that comprised the type of carbine designated by the\n\nmilitary as the M4.       But there is no dispute that the term M4 was\n\ncoined    by    the   military    as   part    of   its   weapons   designation\n\nnomenclature.         Bushmaster presented evidence that the relevant\n\nconsuming public continues to associate M4 with the military\n\ndesignation for a carbine that has certain characteristics.                Colt\n\nhas presented no more than a scintilla of evidence to show that the\n\nrelevant public has come to understand M4 as an identifier of a\n\nColt-made product.       See Hochen v. Bobst Group, Inc., 290 F.3d 446,\n\n453 (1st Cir. 2002) (stating that non-moving party must offer more\n\nthan a \"mere scintilla\" of evidence to survive summary judgment\n\nmotion).        Accordingly,     the   district     court   correctly   granted\n\nBushmaster summary judgment on Colt's infringement claim and its\n\ncancellation counterclaim.10\n\n\n     10\n      Colt also sued Bushmaster for infringement of the term \"Match\nTarget.\"   The magistrate judge recommended granting Bushmaster\nsummary judgment on the ground that there was no likelihood of\nconfusion.   See Borinquen Biscuit, 443 F.3d at 120 (showing of\nlikelihood of confusion is element of trademark infringement\n\n                                        -18-\n\f                              III.\n\n          For the reasons stated above, the judgment is affirmed.\n\nCosts are awarded to Bushmaster.\n\n\n\n\nclaim). In its objection to the magistrate judge's recommendation,\nColt did not specifically challenge the ruling pertaining to the\n\"Match Target\" infringement claim. Accordingly, Colt's appellate\nchallenge to this ruling is waived. Santiago v. Canon USA, Inc.,\n138 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1998) (\"[A] party's failure to assert a\nspecific objection to a report and recommendation irretrievably\nwaives any right to review by the district court and the court of\nappeals.\").\n\n                              -19-\n\f",

(Bushmaster) over Bushmaster's use of the term \"M4\" in conjunction with its sale of certain firearms. The district court concluded that the term was generic and not entitled to trademark protection. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1959, Colt purchased the right to develop the Armalite Rifle model 15 (AR-15), a small-caliber, gas-operated carbine rifle initially developed at the Armalite Division of Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation. Colt sold a variant of the AR-15 to the United States military, which eventually designated it as the M16.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early 1980s, the military determined that it needed a more compact version of the M16. Colt originally designed the prototype for this new weapon under a 1985 contract with the military in which Colt agreed to build and test forty \"XM4 Carbines.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In 1990, the military entered into an agreement with Bushmaster to provide sixty-five carbines \"having all the physical and technical characteristics of the M4 Carbine.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, the military designated the new compact version of the M16 carbine as the M4. This was the latest in a series of carbine designations beginning with the M1 in 1940. The M4 characteristics were derived from the XM4 prototype designed by Colt. The M4 is a lightweight, gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed, selective-rate-of-fire carbine with a collapsible stock. It shares about eighty percent commonality with the M16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An intellectual property dispute arose between Colt and the military in the mid 1990's. Colt claimed that the military had breached a licensing agreement concerning the technology for the M16 by disclosing proprietary information to third parties. As part of the settlement of this dispute, the military and Colt executed the 1997 \"M4 Carbine Addendum to Technical Data Sales and Patent License Agreement\" (Addendum). The Addendum recognized Colt's right to the proprietary information incorporated in the M4 carbine design and defined the term \"M4 Carbine\" to mean \"the compact carbine designed by Colt, 5.56mm, having a 14.5\" barrel, with a telescoping buttstock, that is capable of firing in the semi-automatic and or three round bursts, defined in \"U.S. Government specification MIL-C-70559. . . .\" The design set forth in MIL-C-70559 was deemed proprietary to Colt and, as part of the Addendum, the military designated Colt as its sole supplier of M4s until 2011.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Outside of the military context, Colt and Bushmaster have long competed in the sale of carbines. Bushmaster is the leading producer of carbines for the United States commercial and law-enforcement markets, while Colt is the leading supplier to the U.S. military but also sells to foreign governments, law enforcement agencies, and the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colt and Bushmaster each use the term \"M4\" in marketing versions of their carbines. Bushmaster began using M4 in its advertising in 1991 and has since done so continuously. In 1997, Bushmaster began to refer to the \"M4 type\" weapon in its advertising \"to avoid possible confusion.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> Colt has also used M4 continuously in its advertising since at least 1992 and registered M4 on the Principal Register of the Patent and Trademark Office in 2001. Other carbine manufacturers, including Heckler &amp; Koch, Inc., also use M4 in their advertising.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2004, Colt filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against Bushmaster and Heckler &amp; Koch for, <i>inter alia,</i> infringing on its M4 mark in violation of the Lanham Act. <i>See</i> 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1051 <i>et seq.</i> Bushmaster, a Maine-based company, successfully moved to have the claims against it severed and transferred to the United States District Court for the District of Maine. Bushmaster counterclaimed for the cancellation of Colt's registration of the M4 mark. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1064.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Heckler &amp; Koch settled with Colt. In the settlement agreement, Heckler &amp; Koch was not required to pay Colt any money but acknowledged \"that Colt owns the M4 trademark and agrees that Colt's M4 trademark is a valid and enforceable trademark that should not be cancelled on the grounds of genericness.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Bushmaster did not settle and, in due course, moved for summary judgment on Colt's infringement claim and its own cancellation counterclaim. The motion was assigned to a magistrate judge, who recommended granting Bushmaster's motion. The magistrate judge concluded that the undisputed evidence established that M4 was a generic term for a class of carbines and therefore could not be trademarked by Colt. Colt objected, but the district court adopted the recommendation without opinion. Colt appealed.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We review the district court's grant of summary judgment de novo. <i>See Calvi v.

Top-Flite Golf Co.,</i> 335 F.3d 15, 19 (1st Cir. 2003). A grant of summary judgment will be upheld if, after construing the record favorably to the nonmoving party, there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. <i>See</i> Fed.

There are several examples of media publications using M4 in a generic fashion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For example, an article appearing on a website called quarterbore.com described the \"M4 Carbine [as] like the M16 but . . . more compact and featur[ing] a collapsible stock.\" This article, and several similar ones, refer to the M4 as a type of carbine with certain characteristics, not a brand of carbine sold by a certain producer, and therefore support a determination of genericness. <i>See Murphy Door Bed,</i> 874 F.2d at 101 (concluding that evidence of \"numerous examples of newspaper and magazine use of the phrase Murphy bed to describe generally a type of bed\" indicated genericness). In addition, there are several articles in the record that review and compare M4 carbines made by different producers. Consistent with generic use, these articles predominantly refer to the name of the manufacturer as the source identifier for an M4-type weapon, e.g., \"Bushmaster M4A1,\" \"Colt M4A1,\" \"Rock River M4.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also evidence demonstrating that the term M4 is used by several of Colt's competitors in their advertising. This evidence is probative of generic use because \"[t]he more members of the public see a term used by competitors in the field, the less likely they will be to identify the term with one particular producer.\" <i>Classic Foods Int'l Corp. v. Kettle Foods, Inc.,</i> 468 F.Supp.2d 1181, 1190 (C.D.Cal. 2007). Recently, the Eighth Circuit affirmed a summary judgment ruling that the term \"brick oven\" was generic as used to describe pizza. <i>Schwan's,</i> 460 F.3d at 971. To support its ruling, the court identified four other retailers that described their product as \"brick oven pizza.\" <i>Id.</i> at 975. While there may be differences between the import of the terms \"M4\" and \"brick oven pizza,\" the relevance of competitor usage to our inquiry is the same. And here, the record evidence is even stronger than in <i>Schwan's</i>&#8212;at least fifteen gun manufacturers use M4 to describe their products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undisputed information from purchasers of carbines also supports the conclusion that M4 is generic. The record includes email messages sent to Bushmaster by a variety of consumers representing civilian, law enforcement, and military purchasers. The emails use M4 as a generic descriptor. Some of the emails are from customers asking Bushmaster for the price of its M4 and information concerning shipment of its M4. These customers use the phrase M4 to describe the type of gun that they hope to purchase, not to identify the manufacturer of the gun. <i>Cf. Glover v. Ampak, Inc.,</i> 74 F.3d 57, 59 (4th Cir. 1996) (stating that genericness can be shown by evidence showing that a purchaser entering a store uses a term to mean any brand of a particular item rather than the brand made by a single company).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there is evidence, albeit limited, that Colt itself has used M4 generically. Generic use by the party seeking trademark protection is relevant because \"[a] kind of estoppel arises when the proponent of [a] trademark use is proven to have itself used the term before the public as a generic name. . . .\" <i>McCarthy</i> &#167; 12:13. The record contains a Colt document using the term M4 to describe a type of carbine. Specifically, a patent application filed by a Colt employee referred to \"M4 <i>type</i> rifles and carbines\" (emphasis added). <i>See Pilates, Inc. v. Current Concepts, Inc.,</i> 120 F.Supp.2d 286, 299 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (use of challenged term to describe a product in a generic way by the party claiming infringement can suggest that a term is generic); <i>Birtcher Electro Med. Sys., Inc. v. Beacon Labs., Inc.,</i> 738 F.Supp. 417, 420-21 (D.Colo. 1990) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, Bushmaster presented sufficient evidence to rebut the presumption that Colt's mark is not generic. Moreover, this evidence if undisputed, would entitle Bushmaster to summary judgment on Colt's infringement claim and its cancellation counterclaim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Colt contends, however, that the evidence submitted by Bushmaster was misinterpreted and overvalued, and that other evidence that would create a genuine issue of material fact was ignored. We first consider Colt's challenges to the evidence relied on by Bushmaster and then consider the evidence that Colt contends was ignored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colt claims first that the evidence concerning media publications is not particularly useful in the genericness inquiry and therefore should have been accorded \"limited significance.\" In support of this proposition, it relies on a dictum from the Third Circuit that use of a term in trade journals to show generic use may be \"problematic.\" <i>Berner Int'l Corp. v. Mars Sales Co.,</i> 987 F.2d 975, 983 (3d Cir. 1993). The Third Circuit's concern related to the use of trade publications that are directed to producers of a product. The court explained that the use of these materials was \"problematic\" because \"[a]rticles in trade journals may indicate what a term means to the producer but not what it means to the relevant consuming public.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, however, the articles cited by Bushmaster to show generic use were articles written for consumers, not producers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Thus, the concern expressed in <i>Berner</i> has no application because the articles relied on by Bushmaster do show the meaning of M4 to the relevant consuming public.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colt next challenges Bushmaster's reliance on purchaser testimony. As mentioned above, this evidence consisted of several communications from customers to Bushmaster in which they asked Bushmaster questions about <i>its</i> M4 carbine. Colt asserts that this evidence does not show generic use of M4 but rather purchaser confusion. It contends that these purchasers could be understood to have used M4 as a replacement for the name \"Colt\" and were demonstrating that they were confused about the source of the gun. This is not a reasonable inference from the evidence. <i>See Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham,</i> 43 F.3d 731, 743 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"a court pondering a Rule 56 motion need not embrace inferences that are wildly improbable or that rely on tenuous insinuation\"). These purchasers intentionally directed their email communications about purchasing M4s to Bushmaster at Bushmaster's website; there is nothing to suggest that, in asking Bushmaster about an M4 that it was selling, these purchasers thought that they were asking Colt about a weapon that it was selling or were asking Bushmaster about a Colt product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the evidence that Colt contends was overlooked, we begin with Colt's registration of M4 on the Principal Register. Colt claims that its successful registration is a fact that, by itself, defeats Bushmaster's summary judgment motion. This is so, according to Colt, because even after Bushmaster put forward evidence to rebut the presumption of validity established by the registration, \"the registration continued to serve as strong evidence that the trademark is not generic in the eyes of the relevant public.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colt's argument overstates the significance of a registered mark. As stated above, a registered mark serves to establish a rebuttable presumption that the mark is subject to trademark protection. <i>Borinquen v. Biscuit Corp. M.V. Trading Corp.,</i> 443 F.3d 112, 117-18 (1st Cir. 2006). However, once this presumption has been overcome, the party holding the certificate of registration may not avoid summary judgment simply by pointing to the certificate as evidence. <i>See Retail Servs.,</i> 364 F.3d at 543-44; <i>Nartron Corp. v. STMicroelectronics, Inc.,</i> 305 F.3d 397, 405 (6th Cir. 2002); <i>Tie Tech, Inc. v. Kinedyne Corp.,</i> 296 F.3d 778, 784 (9th Cir. 2002); <i>Liquid Controls Corp. v. Liquid Control Corp.,</i> 802 F.2d 934, 937 n. 2 (7th Cir. 1986).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colt relies on the Fourth Circuit's decision in <i>America Online, Inc. v. AT &amp; T Corp.</i> 243 F.3d 812 (4th Cir. 2001), for the proposition that proof of registration is, by itself, adequate to defeat a summary judgment motion. But <i>America Online</i> \"nowhere suggested that registration created a <i>per se</i> issue of fact sufficient to defeat summary judgment.\" <i>Retail Servs.,</i> 364 F.3d at 543. The certificate of registration was sufficient to defeat summary judgment in <i>America Online</i> only because the plaintiff submitted \"other evidence\" that the mark was not generic. <i>Id.; see also Tie Tech,</i> 296 F.3d at 784 (concluding that <i>America Online</i> does not stand for the proposition that \"registration itself would always raise a material issue of fact\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colt next asserts that summary judgment was improper, because there was evidence that the military associates the term M4 with Colt and that, based on this evidence, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that M4 is not generic. Colt contends that this evidence was incorrectly excluded, because its exclusion was based on the court's erroneous view that the military's understanding was irrelevant because \"it was not among the classes of purchasers who are free to choose among the products of competing manufacturers.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We agree with Colt that it would be incorrect to exclude evidence of the military's understanding of the term M4 simply because it had a sole-source contract with Colt and therefore could not purchase the weapon elsewhere. The test for genericness is the \"primary significance of the mark to the <i>relevant</i> public.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1064(3) (emphasis added). Sometimes, the relevant public will not be the potential purchasing public as a whole but rather \"a relatively small group of highly trained and knowledgeable customers.\" <i>Nartron Corp.,</i> 305 F.3d at 406. The military is, of course, a significant and sophisticated participant in the carbine-purchasing market, and we know of no trademark law principle that renders its understanding of the meaning of M4 inadmissible simply because it was under contract to buy exclusively from Colt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But that evidence should be considered does not mean that it carries enough weight to create a triable issue. Colt relies primarily on the Addendum to show that the military associates the term M4 with Colt and points specifically to the provision of the Addendum that provides that the M4 is a carbine \"designed by Colt.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Addendum does not provide an opinion from the military that it believed that M4 was a term associated with Colt. The Addendum memorialized a procurement arrangement negotiated between Colt and the military to resolve an intellectual property dispute. The military could have contracted with multiple producers or given a sole-source contract to another producer to provide it with M4s. Indeed, in 1990, the military did so by contracting with Bushmaster for M4s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At bottom, the Addendum is merely evidence of a business relationship of a limited duration between Colt and the military; it is not evidence of the military's general and enduring understanding of the meaning of M4 outside of the contractual relationship. The genericness inquiry is \"concerned with the common use of language,\" <i>McCarthy</i> &#167; 12:4, not the defined terms in a negotiated contract between the trademark holder and a third party.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Indeed, there is every possibility that the military will contract with another producer to build M4s in 2011, when the Addendum's sole-source provision expires. If the Addendum supported a non-generic finding and the military does change suppliers in 2011, it could lead to the absurd result of the military being prevented from identifying the weapon by use of the very classification system that it originally have devised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colt next points to Heckler &amp; Koch's settlement of Colt's infringement claim as evidence of non-generic use. In the settlement (which did not require Heckler &amp; Koch to pay any money), Heckler &amp; Koch stated \"that Colt owns the M4 trademark and agrees that Colt's M4 trademark is a valid and enforceable trademark that should not be cancelled on the grounds of genericness.\" This statement is not probative for the same basic reason as the evidence concerning the Addendum: it is not evidence of the common use of M4. It is evidence that Heckler &amp; Koch agreed to a legal conclusion for which Colt negotiated. For obvious reasons, such evidence has little, if anything, to do with the general understanding of M4 to the relevant public.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Colt contends that evidence that there are words other than M4 to designate the product at issue was ignored. According to Colt, such evidence is probative of non-generic use because the existence of other suitable identifiers suggest that M4 is not a name for a type of gun but rather is an identifier of the brand of gun. Colt argues that the words carbine, rifle, and firearm are adequate alternative descriptors of the M4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is misplaced. The M4 is a lightweight, gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed, selective-rate-of-fire weapon with a collapsible stock. Colt has identified no word, other than M4, that captures these characteristics. The closest term Colt identifies is \"carbine,\" but carbine means only a \"short-barreled lightweight rifle.\" <i>Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary</i> 335 (1993). It does not capture the several characteristics that comprise an M4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, Colt was integral to the development of the technology that comprised the type of carbine designated by the military as the M4. But there is no dispute that the term M4 was coined by the military as part of its weapons designation nomenclature. Bushmaster presented evidence that the relevant consuming public continues to associate M4 with the military designation for a carbine that has certain characteristics. Colt has presented no more than a scintilla of evidence to show that the relevant public has come to understand M4 as an identifier of a Colt-made product. <i>See Hochen v. Bobst Group, Inc.,</i> 290 F.3d 446, 453 (1st Cir. 2002) (stating that non-moving party must offer more than a \"mere scintilla\" of evidence to survive summary judgment motion). Accordingly, the district court correctly granted Bushmaster summary judgment on Colt's infringement claim and its cancellation counterclaim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">For the reasons stated above, the judgment is <i>affirmed.</i> Costs are awarded to Bushmaster.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The \"M\" designation system is used by the military to identify one piece in a series of various sorts of equipment, e.g. firearms, tanks. \"M\" stands for model, with each new version in the series receiving a sequential number</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn2\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2_ref\">2</a>\n        <p> The \"X\" before \"M\" means that the piece is experimental and has not been officially classified</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn3\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3_ref\">3</a>\n        <p> The record does not include an explanation of the sort of \"confusion\" this modification is intended to avoid</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn4\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4_ref\">4</a>\n        <p> Bushmaster did not submit a consumer survey to support its claim but such evidence, while \"desirable\" to establish genericness, is not required<i>Keebler,</i> 624 F.2d at 375.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn5\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5_ref\">5</a>\n        <p> Colt does not dispute that a conclusion that M4 is generic as a matter of law would support a summary judgment ruling in Bushmaster's favor on the infringement claim and cancellation counterclaim<i>See McCarthy</i> &#167; 20:56 (\"A registration can be cancelled at any time if the registered mark becomes the generic name for the good or services, or a portion thereof, for which it is registered.\").</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn6\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6_ref\">6</a>\n        <p> In addition to the \"quarterbore\" website discussed above, Bushmaster relied on articles from<i>Soldier of Fortune, Special Weapons, Gun &amp; Weapons for Law Enforcement</i> and <i>Shotgun News.</i> These are all consumer-oriented publications.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn7\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7_ref\">7</a>\n        <p> Colt also criticizes the reliance on Bushmaster's publication evidence on the ground that the magistrate judge's analysis contained an internal inconsistency. According to Colt, it is impossible to reconcile the magistrate judge's observation that the record contains numerous articles that identify M4 \"as a Colt product\" with his ultimate conclusion that the publication evidence supported genericness. This was not a contradiction at all. The magistrate judge meant that several articles used M4 to describe Colt's product in the same manner that M4 was used to describe other competitors' products,<i>viz.,</i> along with the name of the producer (e.g. the \"Rock River M4\"/the \"Colt M4\"). As discussed earlier, this type of usage supports a finding of genericness.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> We further observe that terms within an agreement are often defined for the very reason that the common use of a term does not accurately capture the parties' intended meaning for purposes of the relationship</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Colt also contends that Bushmaster \"implicitly acknowledged\" that M4 is a non-generic term by agreeing in 1997 to use the term M4-type \"to reduce confusion.\" As we noted earlier,<i>supra</i> note 3, the record contains neither an explanation of the type of confusion that Bushmaster sought to reduce nor other evidence concerning Bushmaster's decisions to refer to the M4-type weapon (although one possible inference is that the reason was that it would be illegal to sell an automatic M4 to the public). In any event, it would be pure speculation to conclude that this is evidence of Bushmaster's understanding that M4 was not a generic term; the evidence adds little to Colt's case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Colt also sued Bushmaster for infringement of the term \"Match Target.\" The magistrate judge recommended granting Bushmaster summary judgment on the ground that there was no likelihood of confusion<i>See Borinquen Biscuit,</i> 443 F.3d at 120 (showing of likelihood of confusion is element of trademark infringement claim). In its objection to the magistrate judge's recommendation, Colt did not specifically challenge the ruling pertaining to the \"Match Target\" infringement claim. Accordingly, Colt's appellate challenge to this ruling is waived. <i>Santiago v.

(Bushmaster) over Bushmaster's use of the term \"M4\" in conjunction with its sale of certain firearms. The district court concluded that the term was generic and not entitled to trademark protection. We affirm.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1959, Colt purchased the right to develop the Armalite Rifle model 15 (AR-15), a small-caliber, gas-operated carbine rifle initially developed at the Armalite Division of Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation. Colt sold a variant of the AR-15 to the United States military, which eventually designated it as the M16.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In the early 1980s, the military determined that it needed a more compact version of the M16. Colt originally designed the prototype for this new weapon under a 1985 contract with the military in which Colt agreed to build and test forty \"XM4 Carbines.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In 1990, the military entered into an agreement with Bushmaster to provide sixty-five carbines \"having all the physical and technical characteristics of the M4 Carbine.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, the military designated the new compact version of the M16 carbine as the M4. This was the latest in a series of carbine designations beginning with the M1 in 1940. The M4 characteristics were derived from the XM4 prototype designed by Colt. The M4 is a lightweight, gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed, selective-rate-of-fire carbine with a collapsible stock. It shares about eighty percent commonality with the M16.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An intellectual property dispute arose between Colt and the military in the mid 1990's. Colt claimed that the military had breached a licensing agreement concerning the technology for the M16 by disclosing proprietary information to third parties. As part of the settlement of this dispute, the military and Colt executed the 1997 \"M4 Carbine Addendum to Technical Data Sales and Patent License Agreement\" (Addendum). The Addendum recognized Colt's right to the proprietary information incorporated in the M4 carbine design and defined the term \"M4 Carbine\" to mean \"the compact carbine designed by Colt, 5.56mm, having a 14.5\" barrel, with a telescoping buttstock, that is capable of firing in the semi-automatic and or three round bursts, defined in \"U.S. Government specification MIL-C-70559. . . .\" The design set forth in MIL-C-70559 was deemed proprietary to Colt and, as part of the Addendum, the military designated Colt as its sole supplier of M4s until 2011.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Outside of the military context, Colt and Bushmaster have long competed in the sale of carbines. Bushmaster is the leading producer of carbines for the United States commercial and law-enforcement markets, while Colt is the leading supplier to the U.S. military but also sells to foreign governments, law enforcement agencies, and the public.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colt and Bushmaster each use the term \"M4\" in marketing versions of their carbines.

There are several examples of media publications using M4 in a generic fashion.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> For example, an article appearing on a website called quarterbore.com described the \"M4 Carbine [as] like the M16 but . . . more compact and featur[ing] a collapsible stock.\" This article, and several similar ones, refer to the M4 as a type of carbine with certain characteristics, not a brand of carbine sold by a certain producer, and therefore support a determination of genericness. <i>See Murphy Door Bed,</i> 874 F.2d at 101 (concluding that evidence of \"numerous examples of newspaper and magazine use of the phrase Murphy bed to describe generally a type of bed\" indicated genericness). In addition, there are several articles in the record that review and compare M4 carbines made by different producers. Consistent with generic use, these articles predominantly refer to the name of the manufacturer as the source identifier for an M4-type weapon, e.g., \"Bushmaster M4A1,\" \"Colt M4A1,\" \"Rock River M4.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There is also evidence demonstrating that the term M4 is used by several of Colt's competitors in their advertising. This evidence is probative of generic use because \"[t]he more members of the public see a term used by competitors in the field, the less likely they will be to identify the term with one particular producer.\" <i>Classic Foods Int'l Corp. v. Kettle Foods, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2530948\"><a href=\"/opinion/2530948/classic-foods-intern-corp-v-kettle-foods-inc/\"><span class=\"volume\">468</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.

Recently, the Eighth Circuit affirmed a summary judgment ruling that the term \"brick oven\" was generic as used to describe pizza. <i>Schwan's,</i> 460 F.3d at 971. To support its ruling, the court identified four other retailers that described their product as \"brick oven pizza.\" <i>Id.</i> at 975. While there may be differences between the import of the terms \"M4\" and \"brick oven pizza,\" the relevance of competitor usage to our inquiry is the same. And here, the record evidence is even stronger than in <i>Schwan's</i>&#8212;at least fifteen gun manufacturers use M4 to describe their products.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Undisputed information from purchasers of carbines also supports the conclusion that M4 is generic. The record includes email messages sent to Bushmaster by a variety of consumers representing civilian, law enforcement, and military purchasers. The emails use M4 as a generic descriptor. Some of the emails are from customers asking Bushmaster for the price of its M4 and information concerning shipment of its M4. These customers use the phrase M4 to describe the type of gun that they hope to purchase, not to identify the manufacturer of the gun. <i>Cf. Glover v. Ampak, Inc.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"711071\"><a href=\"/opinion/711071/james-hollis-glover-aka-trading-post-v-ampak-incorporated-knives/\"><span class=\"volume\">74</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 59 (4th Cir. 1996) (stating that genericness can be shown by evidence showing that a purchaser entering a store uses a term to mean any brand of a particular item rather than the brand made by a single company).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, there is evidence, albeit limited, that Colt itself has used M4 generically. Generic use by the party seeking trademark protection is relevant because \"[a] kind of estoppel arises when the proponent of [a] trademark use is proven to have itself used the term before the public as a generic name. . . .\" <i>McCarthy</i> &#167; 12:13. The record contains a Colt document using the term M4 to describe a type of carbine. Specifically, a patent application filed by a Colt employee referred to \"M4 <i>type</i> rifles and carbines\" (emphasis added). <i>See Pilates, Inc. v.

Moreover, this evidence if undisputed, would entitle Bushmaster to summary judgment on Colt's infringement claim and its cancellation counterclaim.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> Colt contends, however, that the evidence submitted by Bushmaster was misinterpreted and overvalued, and that other evidence that would create a genuine issue of material fact was ignored. We first consider Colt's challenges to the evidence relied on by Bushmaster and then consider the evidence that Colt contends was ignored.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colt claims first that the evidence concerning media publications is not particularly useful in the genericness inquiry and therefore should have been accorded \"limited significance.\" In support of this proposition, it relies on a dictum from the Third Circuit that use of a term in trade journals to show generic use may be \"problematic.\" <i>Berner Int'l Corp. v. Mars Sales Co.,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"601794\"><a href=\"/opinion/601794/berner-international-corporation-v-mars-sales-company/\"><span class=\"volume\">987</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">975</span></a></span>, 983 (3d Cir. 1993). The Third Circuit's concern related to the use of trade publications that are directed to producers of a product. The court explained that the use of these materials was \"problematic\" because \"[a]rticles in trade journals may indicate what a term means to the producer but not what it means to the relevant consuming public.\" <i>Id.</i> Here, however, the articles cited by Bushmaster to show generic use were articles written for consumers, not producers.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a> Thus, the concern expressed in <i>Berner</i> has no application because the articles relied on by Bushmaster do show the meaning of M4 to the relevant consuming public.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colt next challenges Bushmaster's reliance on purchaser testimony. As mentioned above, this evidence consisted of several communications from customers to Bushmaster in which they asked Bushmaster questions about <i>its</i> M4 carbine. Colt asserts that this evidence does not show generic use of M4 but rather purchaser confusion. It contends that these purchasers could be understood to have used M4 as a replacement for the name \"Colt\" and were demonstrating that they were confused about the source of the gun. This is not a reasonable inference from the evidence. <i>See Nat'l Amusements, Inc. v. Town of Dedham,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"195818\"><a href=\"/opinion/195818/national-amusements-v-town-of-dedham/\"><span class=\"volume\">43</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">731</span></a></span>, 743 (1st Cir. 1995) (\"a court pondering a Rule 56 motion need not embrace inferences that are wildly improbable or that rely on tenuous insinuation\"). These purchasers intentionally directed their email communications about purchasing M4s to Bushmaster at Bushmaster's website; there is nothing to suggest that, in asking Bushmaster about an M4 that it was selling, these purchasers thought that they were asking Colt about a weapon that it was selling or were asking Bushmaster about a Colt product.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Turning to the evidence that Colt contends was overlooked, we begin with Colt's registration of M4 on the Principal Register. Colt claims that its successful registration is a fact that, by itself, defeats Bushmaster's summary judgment motion. This is so, according to Colt, because even after Bushmaster put forward evidence to rebut the presumption of validity established by the registration, \"the registration continued to serve as strong evidence that the trademark is not generic in the eyes of the relevant public.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colt's argument overstates the significance of a registered mark.

The certificate of registration was sufficient to defeat summary judgment in <i>America Online</i> only because the plaintiff submitted \"other evidence\" that the mark was not generic. <i>Id.; see also Tie Tech,</i> 296 F.3d at 784 (concluding that <i>America Online</i> does not stand for the proposition that \"registration itself would always raise a material issue of fact\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colt next asserts that summary judgment was improper, because there was evidence that the military associates the term M4 with Colt and that, based on this evidence, a reasonable factfinder could conclude that M4 is not generic.

The test for genericness is the \"primary significance of the mark to the <i>relevant</i> public.\" 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1064(3) (emphasis added). Sometimes, the relevant public will not be the potential purchasing public as a whole but rather \"a relatively small group of highly trained and knowledgeable customers.\" <i>Nartron Corp.,</i> 305 F.3d at 406. The military is, of course, a significant and sophisticated participant in the carbine-purchasing market, and we know of no trademark law principle that renders its understanding of the meaning of M4 inadmissible simply because it was under contract to buy exclusively from Colt.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But that evidence should be considered does not mean that it carries enough weight to create a triable issue. Colt relies primarily on the Addendum to show that the military associates the term M4 with Colt and points specifically to the provision of the Addendum that provides that the M4 is a carbine \"designed by Colt.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Addendum does not provide an opinion from the military that it believed that M4 was a term associated with Colt. The Addendum memorialized a procurement arrangement negotiated between Colt and the military to resolve an intellectual property dispute. The military could have contracted with multiple producers or given a sole-source contract to another producer to provide it with M4s. Indeed, in 1990, the military did so by contracting with Bushmaster for M4s.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At bottom, the Addendum is merely evidence of a business relationship of a limited duration between Colt and the military; it is not evidence of the military's general and enduring understanding of the meaning of M4 outside of the contractual relationship. The genericness inquiry is \"concerned with the common use of language,\" <i>McCarthy</i> &#167; 12:4, not the defined terms in a negotiated contract between the trademark holder and a third party.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> Indeed, there is every possibility that the military will contract with another producer to build M4s in 2011, when the Addendum's sole-source provision expires. If the Addendum supported a non-generic finding and the military does change suppliers in 2011, it could lead to the absurd result of the military being prevented from identifying the weapon by use of the very classification system that it originally have devised.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Colt next points to Heckler &amp; Koch's settlement of Colt's infringement claim as evidence of non-generic use. In the settlement (which did not require Heckler &amp; Koch to pay any money), Heckler &amp; Koch stated \"that Colt owns the M4 trademark and agrees that Colt's M4 trademark is a valid and enforceable trademark that should not be cancelled on the grounds of genericness.\" This statement is not probative for the same basic reason as the evidence concerning the Addendum: it is not evidence of the common use of M4. It is evidence that Heckler &amp; Koch agreed to a legal conclusion for which Colt negotiated. For obvious reasons, such evidence has little, if anything, to do with the general understanding of M4 to the relevant public.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, Colt contends that evidence that there are words other than M4 to designate the product at issue was ignored. According to Colt, such evidence is probative of non-generic use because the existence of other suitable identifiers suggest that M4 is not a name for a type of gun but rather is an identifier of the brand of gun. Colt argues that the words carbine, rifle, and firearm are adequate alternative descriptors of the M4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This argument is misplaced. The M4 is a lightweight, gas-operated, air-cooled, magazine-fed, selective-rate-of-fire weapon with a collapsible stock. Colt has identified no word, other than M4, that captures these characteristics. The closest term Colt identifies is \"carbine,\" but carbine means only a \"short-barreled lightweight rifle.\" <i>Webster's Third New Int'l Dictionary</i> 335 (1993). It does not capture the several characteristics that comprise an M4.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To summarize, Colt was integral to the development of the technology that comprised the type of carbine designated by the military as the M4. But there is no dispute that the term M4 was coined by the military as part of its weapons designation nomenclature. Bushmaster presented evidence that the relevant consuming public continues to associate M4 with the military designation for a carbine that has certain characteristics. Colt has presented no more than a scintilla of evidence to show that the relevant public has come to understand M4 as an identifier of a Colt-made product. <i>See Hochen v.

According to Colt, it is impossible to reconcile the magistrate judge's observation that the record contains numerous articles that identify M4 \"as a Colt product\" with his ultimate conclusion that the publication evidence supported genericness. This was not a contradiction at all. The magistrate judge meant that several articles used M4 to describe Colt's product in the same manner that M4 was used to describe other competitors' products,<i>viz.,</i> along with the name of the producer (e.g. the \"Rock River M4\"/the \"Colt M4\"). As discussed earlier, this type of usage supports a finding of genericness.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn8\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8_ref\">8</a>\n        <p> We further observe that terms within an agreement are often defined for the very reason that the common use of a term does not accurately capture the parties' intended meaning for purposes of the relationship</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn9\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9_ref\">9</a>\n        <p> Colt also contends that Bushmaster \"implicitly acknowledged\" that M4 is a non-generic term by agreeing in 1997 to use the term M4-type \"to reduce confusion.\" As we noted earlier,<i>supra</i> note 3, the record contains neither an explanation of the type of confusion that Bushmaster sought to reduce nor other evidence concerning Bushmaster's decisions to refer to the M4-type weapon (although one possible inference is that the reason was that it would be illegal to sell an automatic M4 to the public). In any event, it would be pure speculation to conclude that this is evidence of Bushmaster's understanding that M4 was not a generic term; the evidence adds little to Colt's case.</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn10\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10_ref\">10</a>\n        <p> Colt also sued Bushmaster for infringement of the term \"Match Target.\" The magistrate judge recommended granting Bushmaster summary judgment on the ground that there was no likelihood of confusion<i>See Borinquen Biscuit,</i> 443 F.3d at 120 (showing of likelihood of confusion is element of trademark infringement claim). In its objection to the magistrate judge's recommendation, Colt did not specifically challenge the ruling pertaining to the \"Match Target\" infringement claim. Accordingly, Colt's appellate challenge to this ruling is waived. <i>Santiago v.
