Edward Portalla challenges\n\nhis conviction on one count of conspiring to distribute cocaine, 21\n\nU.S.C. § 846, and two counts of money laundering, 18 U.S.C. § 1956,\n\ncontending that the government adduced insufficient evidence.                 We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                       I\n\n                                BACKGROUND\n\n            Between January 2001 and November 2002, Raphael Tejada,\n\na cooperating witness for the United States Drug Enforcement Agency\n\n(DEA), made a series of controlled cocaine purchases from Salvatore\n\n(“Rudy”) and Anthony (“Tony”) Carrillo (“the Carrillos”), as well\n\nas their confederate underlings.              The Carrillos utilized cell\n\nphones and pagers purchased from Portalla’s cell phone store to\n\nfacilitate the drug sales, many of which occurred at the Carrillos’\n\nresidences or from their vehicles.              In order to thwart police\n\ndetection of the Carrillos’ drug activities, Portalla arranged that\n\nthe Carrillos purchase the phones under fake names, and advised\n\nthem to discard and replace the phones (or the phones’ SIM – or\n\n“security identity module” – cards) every month, prior to the end\n\nof   the   first   billing   cycle.        Portalla   referred   to   these   as\n\n“throwaway phones”.1\n\n\n      1\n      In June 2002, Portalla also sold a series of throwaway phones\nto Rick Adams. Adams met Tony Carrillo during his visits to\nPortalla’s store, where the three men openly discussed the\nCarrillos’ drug business. Portalla acted as the “middleman” when\nTony Carrillo decided to sell his Chelsea cell phone store to\n\n                                      -2-\n\f          Morever,   Portalla    provided     other   services   to    the\n\nCarrillos.    For example, he had kept the books for a pool hall\n\noperated by the Carrillos, which was a center of their drug\n\ntrafficking   activities.   On   several     occasions,   Portalla    also\n\nprovided the Carrillos and their drug confederates with documents,\n\nsuch as W-2 forms, which falsely stated that they were employed by\n\nhis company Wakefield Communications.       The false documents enabled\n\nthe drug conspirators to purchase expensive houses and luxury\n\nautomobiles, from which they conducted their drug trafficking\n\nactivities.\n\n          In November 2002, Jill Parker, a confederate of the\n\nCarrillos, told Tejada that he could obtain cell phones from\n\nPortalla at Wakefield Communications, and provided Tejada with a\n\nsigned note to give to Portalla, which read:          “Sent over.”     In\n\nJanuary 2003, the DEA dispatched Tejada, equipped with a concealed\n\nrecording device, to the Portalla store to purchase cell phones.\n\nWhen Tejada told Portalla that he had been referred by Jill Parker,\n\nPortalla immediately asserted that Tejada would need to purchase\n\n“throwaway” phones issued in fake names. Tejada told Portalla that\n\nhe would come back another time to buy the phones.        A week later,\n\nTejada returned to the Portalla store, accompanied by undercover\n\nDEA agent Joao Monteiro posing as a drug dealer in need of cell\n\n\n\nAdams, and Portalla advised Adams how to provide throwaway phones\nto his customers.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fphones.   During a recorded conversation, Portalla again described\n\nthe advantages of throwaway phones, particularly their capacity to\n\nconfound law enforcement detection.           Portalla informed Monteiro\n\nthat he had provided similar services to the Carrillos. On January\n\n21 and 30, Monteiro purchased four cell phones from Portalla, under\n\nfalse names, for $600.\n\n           In February 2003, DEA agents arrested the Carrillos and\n\ntheir   drug   confederates,    and    seized      cell   phones   and   pagers\n\npurchased from Portalla.         The agents arrested Portalla, then\n\nsearched his store, where they seized documents related to the\n\nsales of cell phones to the Carrillos and Monteiro, as well as the\n\nfalse employment documents Portalla had provided to the Carrillos\n\nand their confederates to enable their purchases of houses and\n\nautomobiles.\n\n           Portalla was indicted on one count of conspiring to\n\ndistribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. § 846, and ten counts of money\n\nlaundering, 18 U.S.C. § 1956.         The jury found Portalla guilty on\n\nthe conspiracy count, as well as two money laundering counts.                In\n\ndue course, the district court imposed a 120-month prison term.\n\nPortalla now appeals from the judgment of conviction.\n\n                                      II\n\n                                DISCUSSION\n\nA.   The Conspiracy Count\n\n           Portalla   first    contends     that    the   government     adduced\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\finsufficient    evidence       to    support       the    Count       1    conviction     for\n\nconspiring to distribute cocaine.                 See 21 U.S.C. § 846.             We review\n\nsufficiency-of-the-evidence               challenges      de     novo,          viewing   all\n\nevidence, credibility determinations, and reasonable inferences\n\ntherefrom in the light most favorable to the verdict, in order to\n\ndetermine whether the jury rationally could have found that the\n\ngovernment established each element of the charged offense beyond\n\na reasonable doubt.       United States v. Ossai, 485 F.3d 25, 30 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).\n\n          In order to establish the crime of conspiracy, the\n\ngovernment     must    prove        the    existence       of     a       conspiracy,     the\n\ndefendant's    knowledge       of    the    conspiracy,         and       the    defendant's\n\nknowing and voluntary participation in the conspiracy.                                United\n\nStates v. Ortiz, 447 F.3d 28, 32 (1st Cir. 2007).                                 The third\n\n“participation”       element,       the    only    one    Portalla         challenges     on\n\nappeal, requires that the government establish Portalla’s intention\n\nto join the conspiracy and to effectuate the objects of the\n\nconspiracy.    United States v. Lizardo, 445 F.3d 73, 81 (1st Cir.),\n\ncert. denied, 127 S. Ct. 524 (2006).                     The intention to conspire\n\nneed not be express, but may be shown by circumstantial evidence.\n\nId.\n\n          Portalla       contends          that    the    circumstantial            evidence\n\nagainst him failed to support a reasonable inference that he\n\nintended either to agree to the Carrillos’ drug conspiracy or to\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\fadvance its illicit goals.                   Instead, he argues, the evidence\n\nadduced    demonstrated      that       he    was    “merely       indifferent”    or   of\n\nperipheral    significance         to        the    success    or     failure     of    the\n\nconspiracy.       These claims are meritless.\n\n            The     appeal   essentially            rests     on    Portalla's     faulty\n\nassertions that, when viewed in isolation, particular items of\n\ngovernment evidence (e.g., the fact that Portalla had agreed to put\n\none phone in Tony Carrillo’s longtime girlfriend’s name, not in a\n\nfalse name which would frustrate law enforcement discovery), was\n\ninsufficiently probative of Portalla's decision to participate in\n\nthe Carrillo conspiracy, or in the alternative, that the jury\n\nimproperly ignored or discounted other evidence (e.g., the Portalla\n\nstatements that he had advised the Carrillos to “go legit,” or “let\n\nme stay far away. I don’t want nothing to do with [the drug\n\ndealing]”) which would tend to demonstrate that he decided not to\n\nbecome a conspirator.        “[J]uries are not required to examine the\n\nevidence     in    isolation,      for        individual      pieces     of     evidence,\n\ninsufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation\n\nprove it. The sum of an evidentiary presentation may well be\n\ngreater than its constituent parts.” United States v. Downs-Moses,\n\n329 F.3d 253, 261 (1st Cir. 2003) (quoting Bourjaily v. United\n\nStates, 483 U.S. 171, 179-80 (1987)).                  So it is here.\n\n            The government adduced evidence that Portalla knowingly\n\nfacilitated       the   Carrillo    conspiracy         on     several    occasions      by\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\fproviding them with false employment credentials in order to enable\n\npurchases of expensive residences and vehicles, which served the\n\nCarrillos’   drug   trafficking     enterprise.     Portalla’s    false\n\ninformation enabled the Carrillos to conceal the fact that the bulk\n\nof their income derived from illegal drug trafficking. In November\n\n2002, Jill Parker expressly referred Tejada to Portalla as one from\n\nwhom Tejada could acquire cell phones for use in drug trafficking,\n\nadvising Tejada to tell Portalla that Parker had sent him.         When\n\nTejada contacted Portalla and mentioned Parker, Portalla readily\n\nvolunteered to supply Tejada with cell phones under a fake name,\n\nand advised Tejada simply to use and discard the phones after a\n\nmonth and acquire a new phone under yet another false name.\n\nSubsequently, Portalla made similar statements and proposals to\n\nMonteiro, noting that he frequently helped the Carrillos to utilize\n\nfake names to frustrate law enforcement detection. “[W]e require\n\njurors neither ‘to divorce themselves from their common sense, nor\n\nto abandon the dictates of mature experience.’” United States v.\n\nMorillo, 158 F.3d 18, 22 (1st Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).       The\n\ncumulative   evidentiary   weight    of   these   circumstances   amply\n\nsupported a finding that Portalla knowingly and voluntarily decided\n\nto participate in the Carrillos’ drug conspiracy and to effectuate\n\nits goals.\n\n          The Portalla effort to circumvent the jury's common-sense\n\ndetermination is utterly unpersuasive. Although neither Portalla’s\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fmere association with the Carrillos nor his mere presence during\n\ntheir drug conspiracy would suffice to establish knowing and\n\nvoluntary participation in the conspiracy, see Ortiz, 447 F.3d at\n\n32, the mere fortuity that Portalla himself did not sell the drugs,\n\ndid not exercise a leadership position within the conspiracy, and\n\nas the provider of “peripheral” services (viz., the provision of\n\ncell phones designed to elude law enforcement detection) was\n\nunaware of many details of the Carrillos’ drug business, would not\n\nforeclose a reasonable jury from convicting him as a coconspirator.\n\nSee United States v. Rodriguez-Ortiz, 455 F.3d 18, 22-23 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (noting that each coconspirator need not know of nor have\n\ncontact with all other members, nor know all the details of the\n\nconspiracy or participate in each act in furtherance of it), cert.\n\ndenied, 127 S. Ct. 1010 (2007); see also U.S. Sentencing Guidelines\n\nManual      §    3B1.1    (providing   for     a   sentencing   enhancement     for\n\ndefendant’s exercise of authority or control over coconspirators).\n\n                In addition to the sale of illicit drugs, another obvious\n\ngoal   of       the    Carrillo   conspiracy    was   the   avoidance   of   police\n\ndetection.        See United States v. Love, 336 F.3d 643, 645 (7th Cir.\n\n2003) (“[D]rug dealers often conceal the ownership of their cell\n\nphones.”).            In this regard, the evidence supports a reasonable\n\ninference that Portalla knew he was helping the Carrillos conceal\n\nthe ownership of the cell phones which were essential tools of\n\ntheir drug trade.           See, e.g., Rodriguez-Ortiz, 455 F.3d at 21-23\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f(holding that defendant's procurement of cell phones for drug\n\ncoconspirators constituted sufficient evidence that defendant had\n\njoined drug conspiracy).\n\n            Portalla argues that the government simply proved that he\n\nput one phone in the name of Tony Carrillo’s longtime girlfriend\n\n(viz.,    not   a    fake    name),   notes      that      Carrillo       once     refused\n\nPortalla’s offer to sell him a cell phone under a fake name, and\n\nemphasizes that the police seized no physical evidence at his store\n\nto establish that the phones he sold to the Carrillos and their\n\nconfederates        were    “throwaway”    cell      phones.            However,    these\n\nassertions not only misrepresent the trial record but discount the\n\nappellate    standard       of   review.        In   his    pre-    and     post-arrest\n\nstatements, Portalla admitted that he had supplied “throwaway” cell\n\nphones to drug dealers, and provided the Carrillos and their\n\nconfederates        with    several   cell       phones,       thus      inviting      the\n\nreasonable, non-speculative inference that the several cell phones\n\nPortalla sold to his coconspirators were also “throwaways.”                           See\n\nOssai, 485 F.3d at 30 (noting that all reasonable inferences from\n\nthe evidence are to be construed in favor of jury verdict).\n\n            Portalla        further    contends         that       he     was      “merely\n\nindifferent” to the success of the Carrillo conspiracy because he\n\nwould have sold a “throwaway” cell phone to anyone, not only drug\n\ndealers, and indeed he had done so on occasion to persons with poor\n\ncredit.     See United States v. Benevides, 985 F.2d 629, 634 (1st\n\n\n                                          -9-\n\fCir. 1993) (“A conspiracy conviction will not be sustained if the\n\ngovernment's evidence shows that a defendant ‘was indifferent to\n\nthe   [conspiracy's]   outcome   altogether.’”)    (citation       omitted).\n\nWhatever Portalla’s motives for particular phone sales to other\n\ncustomers, however, the fact remains that Portalla sold cell phones\n\nto the Carrillo conspirators for the express purpose of enabling\n\nthem to avoid police detection of their drug trafficking, and his\n\nintent to foster the Carrillo conspiracy is corroborated by his\n\ndecision to provide the Carrillos and their confederates with\n\nadmittedly false employment credentials.          See United States v.\n\nGarcia-Torres, 280 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 2002) (noting that the\n\nprovider of even a “peripheral service” can be held liable as a\n\ncoconspirator where “he knew both that the drug conspiracy existed\n\nand that the peripheral service being furnished was designed to\n\nfoster the conspiracy”).\n\n           Portalla points to evidence that arguably implies that he\n\naffirmatively   determined   not    to    participate   in   the    Carrillo\n\nconspiracy, such as his statements that he had once advised the\n\nCarrillos to “go legit,” or “let me stay far away. I don’t want\n\nnothing to do with [the drug dealing].”         First, whether Portalla\n\nin fact made these statements to the Carrillos plainly constituted\n\na credibility determination for the jury.         See United States v.\n\nEdelkind, 467 F.3d 791, 793 (1st Cir. 2006), cert. denied, 127 S.\n\nCt. 1921 (2007).       Second, neither statement is necessarily or\n\n\n                                   -10-\n\finherently exonerative.         The latter statement, for example, might\n\nnot connote Portalla’s desire to refrain from participation in the\n\ndrug conspiracy, but merely Portalla's desire that the Carrillos do\n\ntheir utmost to conceal his participation in it.               “‘Neither juries\n\nnor judges are required to divorce themselves of common sense,’\n\nwhere, as here, the appellant[s'] portrayal of himself as an\n\ninnocent bystander[] is ‘inherently unbelievable.’”               United States\n\nv. Cuevas-Esquival, 905 F.2d 510, 515 (1st Cir. 1990) (citations\n\nomitted).\n\n            Finally, Portalla’s citation to cases such as United\n\nStates v. Aponte, 905 F.2d 491 (1st Cir. 1990), is unavailing.                 In\n\nAponte, for example, we found insufficient evidence to support a\n\nconspiracy conviction where the defendant asked to join in the\n\nconspiracy, but was refused, then introduced the conspirators to\n\nanother person who joined the conspiracy.                 Id. at 491.          We\n\nconcluded that, despite defendant’s act of introducing another\n\npotential      coconspirator    to   the    conspiracy,   the    conspirators’\n\nrefusal   to    allow    defendant    to   participate    in    the   conspiracy\n\nnecessarily rendered him “indifferent” because it prevented him\n\nfrom   having    any    stake   in   the   conspiracy’s   outcome.       Id.   By\n\ncontrast, here the government adduced evidence that Portalla was\n\neagerly accepted into the Carrillo conspiracy, and repeatedly\n\nprovided it with services essential to its success.               We therefore\n\naffirm Portalla’s conspiracy conviction pursuant to 21 U.S.C. §\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f846.\n\nB.     The Money Laundering Counts\n\n            Portalla    maintains     that    the     government      adduced\n\ninsufficient evidence to support his conviction under the two\n\nmoney-laundering counts because Monteiro never told him that the\n\n$600 that he used to purchase the four throwaway cell phones\n\nconstituted drug proceeds, nor was that sum of money sufficient to\n\ninfer any such an illegal provenance.           See 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)\n\n(requiring that the government prove, inter alia, that the property\n\nused in the money-laundering transaction be represented as drug\n\nproceeds).      We disagree.\n\n            The government need not establish that Monteiro expressly\n\nstated that the $600 constituted drug proceeds, provided that the\n\ntotality of the circumstances, as revealed by all the evidence,\n\nwould lead a reasonable person to draw that conclusion. See United\n\nStates v. Castellini, 392 F.3d 35, 46 (1st Cir. 2004); United\n\nStates v. Kaufmann, 985 F.2d 884, 893 (7th Cir. 1993).             Monteiro\n\npresented himself to Portalla as a drug dealer, expressed his\n\ninterest   in    purchasing    “throwaway”   phones   under   false    names,\n\nboasted that he could afford courtside seats for the Celtics, and\n\nexpressly admitted to Portalla that he had considered laundering\n\nmoney through the Carrillos’ pool hall. Under these circumstances,\n\nthe jury rationally could find that Portalla reasonably would have\n\ninferred that Monteiro was plowing his illicit drug profits back\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\finto his drug business.    Cf. id. at 893-94 (finding sufficient\n\nevidence on “representation” element where car buyer stated he was\n\na drug dealer, and that he wanted to buy the car with cash, using\n\na false name).   We accordingly affirm Portalla’s money-laundering\n\nconvictions pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f",

We\n\naffirm.\n\n                                       I\n\n                                BACKGROUND\n\n            Between January 2001 and November 2002, Raphael Tejada,\n\na cooperating witness for the United States Drug Enforcement Agency\n\n(DEA), made a series of controlled cocaine purchases from Salvatore\n\n(“Rudy”) and Anthony (“Tony”) Carrillo (“the Carrillos”), as well\n\nas their confederate underlings.              The Carrillos utilized cell\n\nphones and pagers purchased from Portalla’s cell phone store to\n\nfacilitate the drug sales, many of which occurred at the Carrillos’\n\nresidences or from their vehicles.              In order to thwart police\n\ndetection of the Carrillos’ drug activities, Portalla arranged that\n\nthe Carrillos purchase the phones under fake names, and advised\n\nthem to discard and replace the phones (or the phones’ SIM – or\n\n“security identity module” – cards) every month, prior to the end\n\nof   the   first   billing   cycle.        Portalla   referred   to   these   as\n\n“throwaway phones”.1\n\n\n      1\n      In June 2002, Portalla also sold a series of throwaway phones\nto Rick Adams. Adams met Tony Carrillo during his visits to\nPortalla’s store, where the three men openly discussed the\nCarrillos’ drug business. Portalla acted as the “middleman” when\nTony Carrillo decided to sell his Chelsea cell phone store to\n\n                                      -2-\n\f          Morever,   Portalla    provided     other   services   to    the\n\nCarrillos.    For example, he had kept the books for a pool hall\n\noperated by the Carrillos, which was a center of their drug\n\ntrafficking   activities.   On   several     occasions,   Portalla    also\n\nprovided the Carrillos and their drug confederates with documents,\n\nsuch as W-2 forms, which falsely stated that they were employed by\n\nhis company Wakefield Communications.       The false documents enabled\n\nthe drug conspirators to purchase expensive houses and luxury\n\nautomobiles, from which they conducted their drug trafficking\n\nactivities.\n\n          In November 2002, Jill Parker, a confederate of the\n\nCarrillos, told Tejada that he could obtain cell phones from\n\nPortalla at Wakefield Communications, and provided Tejada with a\n\nsigned note to give to Portalla, which read:          “Sent over.”     In\n\nJanuary 2003, the DEA dispatched Tejada, equipped with a concealed\n\nrecording device, to the Portalla store to purchase cell phones.\n\nWhen Tejada told Portalla that he had been referred by Jill Parker,\n\nPortalla immediately asserted that Tejada would need to purchase\n\n“throwaway” phones issued in fake names. Tejada told Portalla that\n\nhe would come back another time to buy the phones.        A week later,\n\nTejada returned to the Portalla store, accompanied by undercover\n\nDEA agent Joao Monteiro posing as a drug dealer in need of cell\n\n\n\nAdams, and Portalla advised Adams how to provide throwaway phones\nto his customers.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fphones.   During a recorded conversation, Portalla again described\n\nthe advantages of throwaway phones, particularly their capacity to\n\nconfound law enforcement detection.           Portalla informed Monteiro\n\nthat he had provided similar services to the Carrillos. On January\n\n21 and 30, Monteiro purchased four cell phones from Portalla, under\n\nfalse names, for $600.\n\n           In February 2003, DEA agents arrested the Carrillos and\n\ntheir   drug   confederates,    and    seized      cell   phones   and   pagers\n\npurchased from Portalla.         The agents arrested Portalla, then\n\nsearched his store, where they seized documents related to the\n\nsales of cell phones to the Carrillos and Monteiro, as well as the\n\nfalse employment documents Portalla had provided to the Carrillos\n\nand their confederates to enable their purchases of houses and\n\nautomobiles.\n\n           Portalla was indicted on one count of conspiring to\n\ndistribute cocaine, 21 U.S.C. § 846, and ten counts of money\n\nlaundering, 18 U.S.C. § 1956.         The jury found Portalla guilty on\n\nthe conspiracy count, as well as two money laundering counts.                In\n\ndue course, the district court imposed a 120-month prison term.\n\nPortalla now appeals from the judgment of conviction.\n\n                                      II\n\n                                DISCUSSION\n\nA.   The Conspiracy Count\n\n           Portalla   first    contends     that    the   government     adduced\n\n\n                                      -4-\n\finsufficient    evidence       to    support       the    Count       1    conviction     for\n\nconspiring to distribute cocaine.

The intention to conspire\n\nneed not be express, but may be shown by circumstantial evidence.\n\nId.\n\n          Portalla       contends          that    the    circumstantial            evidence\n\nagainst him failed to support a reasonable inference that he\n\nintended either to agree to the Carrillos’ drug conspiracy or to\n\n\n                                            -5-\n\fadvance its illicit goals.                   Instead, he argues, the evidence\n\nadduced    demonstrated      that       he    was    “merely       indifferent”    or   of\n\nperipheral    significance         to        the    success    or     failure     of    the\n\nconspiracy.       These claims are meritless.\n\n            The     appeal   essentially            rests     on    Portalla's     faulty\n\nassertions that, when viewed in isolation, particular items of\n\ngovernment evidence (e.g., the fact that Portalla had agreed to put\n\none phone in Tony Carrillo’s longtime girlfriend’s name, not in a\n\nfalse name which would frustrate law enforcement discovery), was\n\ninsufficiently probative of Portalla's decision to participate in\n\nthe Carrillo conspiracy, or in the alternative, that the jury\n\nimproperly ignored or discounted other evidence (e.g., the Portalla\n\nstatements that he had advised the Carrillos to “go legit,” or “let\n\nme stay far away. I don’t want nothing to do with [the drug\n\ndealing]”) which would tend to demonstrate that he decided not to\n\nbecome a conspirator.        “[J]uries are not required to examine the\n\nevidence     in    isolation,      for        individual      pieces     of     evidence,\n\ninsufficient in themselves to prove a point, may in cumulation\n\nprove it. The sum of an evidentiary presentation may well be\n\ngreater than its constituent parts.” United States v.

So it is here.\n\n            The government adduced evidence that Portalla knowingly\n\nfacilitated       the   Carrillo    conspiracy         on     several    occasions      by\n\n\n                                             -6-\n\fproviding them with false employment credentials in order to enable\n\npurchases of expensive residences and vehicles, which served the\n\nCarrillos’   drug   trafficking     enterprise.     Portalla’s    false\n\ninformation enabled the Carrillos to conceal the fact that the bulk\n\nof their income derived from illegal drug trafficking. In November\n\n2002, Jill Parker expressly referred Tejada to Portalla as one from\n\nwhom Tejada could acquire cell phones for use in drug trafficking,\n\nadvising Tejada to tell Portalla that Parker had sent him.         When\n\nTejada contacted Portalla and mentioned Parker, Portalla readily\n\nvolunteered to supply Tejada with cell phones under a fake name,\n\nand advised Tejada simply to use and discard the phones after a\n\nmonth and acquire a new phone under yet another false name.\n\nSubsequently, Portalla made similar statements and proposals to\n\nMonteiro, noting that he frequently helped the Carrillos to utilize\n\nfake names to frustrate law enforcement detection. “[W]e require\n\njurors neither ‘to divorce themselves from their common sense, nor\n\nto abandon the dictates of mature experience.’” United States v.\n\nMorillo, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"198160\"><a href=\"/opinion/198160/united-states-v-morillo/\"><span class=\"volume\">158</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">18</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 22 (1st Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).       The\n\ncumulative   evidentiary   weight    of   these   circumstances   amply\n\nsupported a finding that Portalla knowingly and voluntarily decided\n\nto participate in the Carrillos’ drug conspiracy and to effectuate\n\nits goals.\n\n          The Portalla effort to circumvent the jury's common-sense\n\ndetermination is utterly unpersuasive. Although neither Portalla’s\n\n\n                                  -7-\n\fmere association with the Carrillos nor his mere presence during\n\ntheir drug conspiracy would suffice to establish knowing and\n\nvoluntary participation in the conspiracy, see Ortiz, 447 F.3d at\n\n32, the mere fortuity that Portalla himself did not sell the drugs,\n\ndid not exercise a leadership position within the conspiracy, and\n\nas the provider of “peripheral” services (viz., the provision of\n\ncell phones designed to elude law enforcement detection) was\n\nunaware of many details of the Carrillos’ drug business, would not\n\nforeclose a reasonable jury from convicting him as a coconspirator.\n\nSee United States v.

In this regard, the evidence supports a reasonable\n\ninference that Portalla knew he was helping the Carrillos conceal\n\nthe ownership of the cell phones which were essential tools of\n\ntheir drug trade.           See, e.g., Rodriguez-Ortiz, 455 F.3d at 21-23\n\n\n                                         -8-\n\f(holding that defendant's procurement of cell phones for drug\n\ncoconspirators constituted sufficient evidence that defendant had\n\njoined drug conspiracy).\n\n            Portalla argues that the government simply proved that he\n\nput one phone in the name of Tony Carrillo’s longtime girlfriend\n\n(viz.,    not   a    fake    name),   notes      that      Carrillo       once     refused\n\nPortalla’s offer to sell him a cell phone under a fake name, and\n\nemphasizes that the police seized no physical evidence at his store\n\nto establish that the phones he sold to the Carrillos and their\n\nconfederates        were    “throwaway”    cell      phones.            However,    these\n\nassertions not only misrepresent the trial record but discount the\n\nappellate    standard       of   review.        In   his    pre-    and     post-arrest\n\nstatements, Portalla admitted that he had supplied “throwaway” cell\n\nphones to drug dealers, and provided the Carrillos and their\n\nconfederates        with    several   cell       phones,       thus      inviting      the\n\nreasonable, non-speculative inference that the several cell phones\n\nPortalla sold to his coconspirators were also “throwaways.”                           See\n\nOssai, 485 F.3d at 30 (noting that all reasonable inferences from\n\nthe evidence are to be construed in favor of jury verdict).\n\n            Portalla        further    contends         that       he     was      “merely\n\nindifferent” to the success of the Carrillo conspiracy because he\n\nwould have sold a “throwaway” cell phone to anyone, not only drug\n\ndealers, and indeed he had done so on occasion to persons with poor\n\ncredit.

In\n\nAponte, for example, we found insufficient evidence to support a\n\nconspiracy conviction where the defendant asked to join in the\n\nconspiracy, but was refused, then introduced the conspirators to\n\nanother person who joined the conspiracy.                 Id. at 491.          We\n\nconcluded that, despite defendant’s act of introducing another\n\npotential      coconspirator    to   the    conspiracy,   the    conspirators’\n\nrefusal   to    allow    defendant    to   participate    in    the   conspiracy\n\nnecessarily rendered him “indifferent” because it prevented him\n\nfrom   having    any    stake   in   the   conspiracy’s   outcome.       Id.   By\n\ncontrast, here the government adduced evidence that Portalla was\n\neagerly accepted into the Carrillo conspiracy, and repeatedly\n\nprovided it with services essential to its success.               We therefore\n\naffirm Portalla’s conspiracy conviction pursuant to 21 U.S.C. §\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\f846.\n\nB.     The Money Laundering Counts\n\n            Portalla    maintains     that    the     government      adduced\n\ninsufficient evidence to support his conviction under the two\n\nmoney-laundering counts because Monteiro never told him that the\n\n$600 that he used to purchase the four throwaway cell phones\n\nconstituted drug proceeds, nor was that sum of money sufficient to\n\ninfer any such an illegal provenance.           See 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a)\n\n(requiring that the government prove, inter alia, that the property\n\nused in the money-laundering transaction be represented as drug\n\nproceeds).      We disagree.\n\n            The government need not establish that Monteiro expressly\n\nstated that the $600 constituted drug proceeds, provided that the\n\ntotality of the circumstances, as revealed by all the evidence,\n\nwould lead a reasonable person to draw that conclusion. See United\n\nStates v. Castellini, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201380\"><a href=\"/opinion/201380/united-states-v-castellini/\"><span class=\"volume\">392</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">35</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 46 (1st Cir. 2004); United\n\nStates v. Kaufmann, </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"600301\"><a href=\"/opinion/600301/united-states-v-harry-c-kaufmann/\"><span class=\"volume\">985</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">884</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">, 893 (7th Cir. 1993).             Monteiro\n\npresented himself to Portalla as a drug dealer, expressed his\n\ninterest   in    purchasing    “throwaway”   phones   under   false    names,\n\nboasted that he could afford courtside seats for the Celtics, and\n\nexpressly admitted to Portalla that he had considered laundering\n\nmoney through the Carrillos’ pool hall. Under these circumstances,\n\nthe jury rationally could find that Portalla reasonably would have\n\ninferred that Monteiro was plowing his illicit drug profits back\n\n\n                                    -12-\n\finto his drug business.    Cf. id. at 893-94 (finding sufficient\n\nevidence on “representation” element where car buyer stated he was\n\na drug dealer, and that he wanted to buy the car with cash, using\n\na false name).   We accordingly affirm Portalla’s money-laundering\n\nconvictions pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 1956(a).\n\n          Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                               -13-\n\f</pre>",
