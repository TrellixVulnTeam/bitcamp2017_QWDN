This case is another chapter in\n\nthe saga of the relationship between the FBI's Boston Office and\n\ntwo organized crime figures, James \"Whitey\" Bulger and Stephen\n\nFlemmi, whose unlawful, violent conduct in that city spanned three\n\ndecades.      Following an eighteen-day bench trial featuring nine\n\nwitnesses and thousands of pages of exhibits, the district court\n\nconcluded that former FBI agent John Connolly was acting within the\n\nscope    of   his     employment      when    he    leaked    the   identity    of   an\n\ninformant, John McIntyre, resulting in McIntyre's brutal murder by\n\nBulger, Flemmi and their associates in the notorious Winter Hill\n\nGang.         The     court    consequently         awarded     McIntyre's      estate\n\napproximately $3.1 million in damages against the government under\n\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. ยง 1346.\n\n              The government has appealed, arguing that Connolly was a\n\nrogue    agent      whose    disclosure      of    McIntyre's   identity      violated\n\nfundamental FBI policies and was beyond any rational view of\n\nconduct falling within the scope of his employment.                     We reject the\n\ngovernment's position.           We affirm the judgment of the district\n\ncourt.\n\n                                             I.\n\n              The district court meticulously set out the factual\n\nbackground       of   this    case,    detailing       the    decades    of    history\n\nconcerning Bulger's and Flemmi's involvement with the FBI in Boston\n\nand, in particular, the pair's relationship with Connolly.                           See\n\n\n                                          -3-\n\fMcIntyre v. United States, 447 F. Supp. 2d 54, 62-104 (D. Mass.\n\n2006).     Parts of that more than 40-page history also have been\n\nreported in other opinions that we have issued, including our\n\ndecision affirming Connolly's conviction on charges stemming from\n\nhis efforts to facilitate Bulger's and Flemmi's criminal activities\n\nand   to    protect   them      and   their    associates    from   arrest    and\n\nprosecution. See United States v. Connolly, 504 F.3d 206 (1st Cir.\n\n2007); McIntyre v. United States, 367 F.3d 38 (1st Cir. 2004);\n\nUnited States v. Connolly, 341 F.3d 16 (1st Cir. 2003).               Unable to\n\nimprove on the district court's exhaustive review of the record, we\n\nprovide     here   only   a    summary    of   the   facts   essential   to    an\n\nunderstanding of the scope of employment issue at the heart of this\n\ncase.    However, we assume the reader's familiarity with all of the\n\ndistrict court's factual findings, which have not been challenged\n\nby the government on appeal. Our precis borrows liberally from the\n\ndistrict court's well stated recitation, as well as from our own\n\nprior opinions.\n\nA. Connolly's Official Role with Bulger and Flemmi\n\n             Bulger and Flemmi were informants for the FBI's Boston\n\noffice at various times during a period of more than twenty-five\n\nyears.     Flemmi was first recruited in 1964 and Bulger in 1971, and\n\nboth men provided information off and on until 1990. McIntyre, 447\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 73.            They were considered particularly valuable\n\nsources for the office's high-priority investigation of the Boston\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fbranch of La Cosa Nostra (\"LCN\").1      Although they were members of\n\nthe competing Winter Hill Gang, Bulger and Flemmi frequently\n\nconsorted with LCN members \"and purported to transmit inside\n\ninformation to the FBI concerning organized crime activities in New\n\nEngland.\" Connolly, 504 F.3d at 210. The Boston LCN investigation\n\nproved fruitful, leading to the 1983 arrests and 1986 convictions\n\nof the leading figures of the Boston branch, Gennaro Angiulo and\n\nIllario Zannino, as well as other LCN members.            McIntyre, 447 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 63.\n\n           Connolly, who joined the FBI in 1968, served as Bulger\n\nand   Flemmi's   \"handler\"   during   most   of   their    tenure   as   FBI\n\ninformants, beginning in 1975. Connolly, 341 F.3d at 20; McIntyre,\n\n447 F. Supp. 2d at 73-74.2      In that capacity, he met with them\n\n\n      1\n       As the district court related, \"[d]uring the late 1970s and\nearly 1980s, the stated national priority of the FBI's Organized\nCrime Program was the takedown of Cosa Nostra.\" 447 F. Supp. 2d at\n62 (citing Ex. 69, April 1980 Memo from Director, FBI to Attorney\nGeneral, at 17) (\"The majority of resources, both investigative and\nprosecutorial, should continue to be expended and directed against\nLCN, the most powerful of the organized crime groups, as it\nrepresents a greater threat to this nation than all other organized\ncrime groups combined.\"). The Boston LCN branch was likewise \"the\nnumber one priority of the Organized Crime Program in the Boston\nDivision of the FBI . . . in the 1970s and early 1980s.\" Id. at\n62-63 (citing, inter alia, Ex. 110, April 1981, Addendum of\nSupervisor Morris) (\"Consistent with the national priority, the\nLCN is the primary target of the Organized Crime Program in the\nBoston Division.\"); see also Tr. Day 6, at 55 (Testimony of Robert\nFitzpatrick, Assistant Special Agent in Charge (\"ASAC\") of the\nBoston Office, acknowledging that LCN \"was the number one priority\"\nin the office).\n      2\n       Connolly was assigned to the Boston Office's C-3 Squad,\nwhich worked solely on organized crime, from October 1973 until\n\n                                  -5-\n\fregularly and controlled other agents' access to them.                 Rarely did\n\nother FBI agents talk with the two men outside of Connolly's\n\npresence.      See, e.g., id. at 87 (stating that Connolly served as an\n\nintermediary with Bulger and Flemmi for other agents investigating\n\nseveral murders); id. at 90 (noting that the Boston office rejected\n\na request that Bulger and Flemmi be interviewed in connection with\n\ntwo murders \"upon instructions from FBI Headquarters that no one\n\nother than Connolly\" should interview them); id. at 91 (noting\n\nAgent Montanari's belief that \"Bulger and Flemmi, 'as informants of\n\nan    agent'    would     refuse   to   meet   with    him    absent   Connolly's\n\nintervention\"); id. at 98 (\"Bulger and Flemmi communicated almost\n\nexclusively with Connolly, and they refused to work with any other\n\nhandler.\").          When Connolly retired suddenly in 1990, Bulger and\n\nFlemmi were immediately closed as informants.                Id.\n\nB.    Connolly's Collaboration with Bulger and Flemmi\n\n               At some point, the relationship between Connolly and his\n\ntwo informants turned illicit.             A grand jury indicted Connolly in\n\n2000 on charges of racketeering, obstruction of justice, conspiracy\n\nand   making     a    false   statement,    alleging   that    he   had   provided\n\nprotection, the identities of informants, and other assistance to\n\nBulger and Flemmi in exchange for bribes and favors.3                      He was\n\n\nMarch 1988.       Id. at 64-65.\n       3\n       Through the years, Connolly received more than $200,000 in\ncash and gifts from Bulger and Flemmi. 447 F. Supp. 2d at 110\n(citing Flemmi's testimony, Tr. Day 2, at 98; Day 3, at 82-83).\n\n                                        -6-\n\fconvicted in 2002 and sentenced to 121 months in prison.4    We twice\n\nrejected his appeals.   See Connolly, 504 F.3d 206; Connolly, 341\n\nF.3d 16.\n\n           Among Connolly's misdeeds was disclosure of the names of\n\nat least two informants, before the McIntyre episode, both of whom\n\nwere murdered by Flemmi, Bulger or their associates shortly after\n\nthe leaks.   Flemmi stated that, in December 1976, Connolly told\n\nBulger that a bookmaker who did business with the Winter Hill gang,\n\nRichard Castucci, had been cooperating with the FBI.   Tr.    Day 1,\n\nat 90-91; Ex. 3 at 7 (Agreed Statement of Facts in United States v.\n\nFlemmi, No. 99-10371 (D. Mass. May 23, 2001)).   Castucci was shot\n\nto death by members of the group later that month.5         A second\n\ninformant, Edward \"Brian\" Halloran, approached the FBI in early\n\n1982 with information about the Winter Hill Gang and their possible\n\ninvolvement the previous year in the murder in Tulsa, Oklahoma, of\n\na businessman named Roger Wheeler.6      Among other information,\n\n\n     4\n       At the conclusion of a three-week trial, a federal jury\nfound him guilty of one count of racketeering, two counts of\nobstruction of justice, and one count of making false statements.\nConnolly, 341 F.3d at 19.\n     5\n       Flemmi testified that John Martorano shot Castucci in the\nhead, and that Flemmi and Bulger disposed of the body. Tr. Day 1,\nat 93-94.\n     6\n       The Winter Hill associates were, in fact, responsible for\nWheeler's murder.    Flemmi and Bulger provided weapons for the\nkilling, and Martorano shot him outside his country club in Tulsa,\nOklahoma on May 27, 1981. Tr. Day 2, at 21-22 (Flemmi testimony);\nEx. 3, at 10. Wheeler was the owner of World Jai Alai (\"WJA\"), a\nbusiness that operated in Florida and Connecticut. He had drawn\n\n                                -7-\n\fHalloran told Agent Leo Brunnick that Bulger and Flemmi met with\n\nConnolly on a weekly basis and that the two men \"had a 'pipeline\n\ninto the Boston Office.'\"7    447 F. Supp. 2d at 83 (citing Ex. 84,\n\nMemo from Brunnick).    Sometime before May 11, 1982, Connolly told\n\nBulger of Halloran's cooperation.        Tr. Day 2, at 34-35 (Flemmi\n\ntestimony).     Bulger shot and killed Halloran and an associate,\n\nMichael Donahue, on May 11, as they were leaving a restaurant in\n\nBoston.    447 F. Supp. 2d at 86.8\n\n            Agents at the FBI's Boston Office and at FBI Headquarters\n\nsuspected that Bulger and Flemmi were involved in the Wheeler,\n\nHalloran and Donahue murders.     447 F. Supp. 2d at 84-86.   Indeed,\n\nHalloran had told Agent Brunnick and his partner, Agent Gerald\n\nMontanari, that Bulger, Flemmi and Callahan9 were responsible for\n\nplotting Wheeler's murder and that he, Halloran, had been paid\n\n$20,000 to keep quiet about it.      Id. at 82-83 (citing Ex. 27, Memo\n\n\nthe wrath of the Winter Hill gang by refusing to sell the business\nto John Callahan, who was the former president of WJA and had lost\nhis license to operate a parimutual betting business in Connecticut\nbecause of his relationship with \"his gangster friends,\" including\nmembers of the Winter Hill gang. McIntyre, 447 F. Supp. 2d at 81\n(citing Ex. 3); see also Tr. Day 2, at 20 (Flemmi testimony).\n     7\n       Brunnick's memo further states that the \"pipeline\" was \"not\nnecessarily Connolly\" and that Halloran had \"no information or\nindication that Connolly is furnishing any information to Stevie or\nWhitey.\"\n     8\n       As the district court observed, Donahue's killing appears to\nbe a classic case of being \"in the wrong place at the wrong time.\"\n447 F. Supp. 2d at 86.\n     9\n         See supra note 6.\n\n                                  -8-\n\ffrom McWeeney); Tr. Day 15, at 18 (Montanari testimony).          He also\n\ntold the agents that Martorano โ the gunman โ might be using\n\nCallahan's Fort Lauderdale condominium as a safe-house. Id. at 83.\n\nAll of Halloran's information was passed along to FBI Headquarters.\n\nId.   at   84.   Although   some   details   of   Halloran's   story   were\n\ninvestigated, \"inexplicably, the Boston Office never followed up on\n\nHalloran's claim that Martorano, the reported shooter in the\n\nWheeler murder and a federal fugitive, was hiding out at Callahan's\n\ncondominium in Florida.\"     Id. at 85.\n\n            In the last week of May 1982, meetings to discuss the\n\nWheeler and Halloran killings took place in Washington and Boston.\n\nAt the Washington meeting, agents from Boston, Miami and Oklahoma\n\nCity, as well as officials from FBI Headquarters, acknowledged that\n\nBulger and Flemmi were suspects in the cases, but a decision was\n\nmade to retain them as \"open\" informants because the allegations\n\nagainst them were unsubstantiated and they were extremely valuable\n\nassets in the LCN investigation.     Id. at 87 (citing Ex. 30, May 25,\n\n1982 Memo from ASAC Fitzpatrick to Special Agent in Charge (\"SAC\")\n\nLawrence Sarhatt); Tr. Day 9, at 59-60 (Fitzpatrick testimony).10\n\nIf the suspicions had been confirmed, agency policy would have\n\n\n\n\n      10\n       Fitzpatrick testified that, despite his view that Bulger,\nat least, should be closed as an informant, \"everyone at\nheadquarters thought he should remain open\" because \"he was too\nvaluable.\"\n\n                                   -9-\n\fprevented their retention as informants without authorization from\n\nthe highest levels of the FBI and Justice Department.11\n\n            At a follow-up meeting two days later in Boston, Connolly\n\nโ who had not been at the meeting in Washington โ was informed that\n\nBulger and Flemmi were the focus of the investigation into the\n\nWheeler and Halloran murders.       He argued that they were not\n\ninvolved.   It was agreed that the agents investigating the murders\n\nwould not directly interview Bulger and Flemmi, and would rely\n\ninstead on Connolly acting as an intermediary.    447 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n87.\n\n            Two months later, Callahan also was dead.   Connolly had\n\ntold Bulger in July that the FBI was looking for Callahan to\n\nquestion him in connection with the Wheeler murder.     Tr. Day 2, at\n\n\n      11\n        The FBI's rules regarding the handling of informants,\ncontained in Section 137 of the agency's Manual of Investigative\nOperations and Guidelines (\"MIOG\"), required supervisors to make\nwritten findings on the \"suitability\" of an individual to serve as\nan informant. Ex. 6, ยง 137-17(1) (Attorney General's Guidelines on\nFBI Use of Informants and Confidential Sources, Part D(1)(1981)).\nAlthough the Guidelines allow use of informants who are involved in\ncriminal activity, the crimes must not be \"of a serious nature.\"\n447 F. Supp. 2d at 68 (citing Guidelines at Part G(2)). If a field\noffice learned that an informant had participated in a \"serious act\nof violence,\" it was required to notify FBI Headquarters and only\nthe Director or a \"senior Headquarters official\" could approve the\ncontinued use of such an informant โ after consultation with the\nAssistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division. Id.\nat 69-70 (citing Guidelines at Part G(3)). Throughout their tenure\nas informants, Flemmi and Bulger were \"closed\" โ i.e., terminated\nas informants โ and re-opened multiple times.       Id. at 74 n.35\n(giving a chronology of Bulger's and Flemmi's openings and closings\nas informants between 1964 and 1990). At least with respect to\nFlemmi, a closing had little effect; he was treated as an informant\nregardless of his official status. Id. at 74.\n\n                                 -10-\n\f37 (Flemmi testimony).    According to Flemmi, Connolly also told\n\nBulger that \"Callahan was a weak link who would not be able to\n\nwithstand the pressure of an FBI interrogation.\"    447 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 88.    Bulger and Flemmi concluded that Callahan needed to be\n\nkilled. Their usual hit man, Martorano, assisted by another Winter\n\nHill member, Joseph McDonald, killed Callahan at Fort Lauderdale\n\nInternational Airport on August 1, 1982.   Id. at 87 (citing Tr. Day\n\n2, at 40-41, Flemmi testimony).12\n\n           The FBI's recognition of the apparent link between the\n\nWinter Hill gang and three murders โ Wheeler's, Halloran's and\n\nCallahan's โ was reported in a November 1982 memo sent by the Chief\n\nof the FBI's Organized Crime Section, Sean McWeeney, to Associate\n\nDeputy Director Oliver Revell.      The memo stated that \"there is\n\nevidence [the murders] were committed by an organized crime group\n\nin Boston, Massachusetts, the Winter Hill gang.\" Id. at 88 (citing\n\nEx. 121, at 1).   James Greenleaf, who became the SAC of the Boston\n\nOffice on November 29, 1982, was among those copied on the memo,\n\nwhich was generated at FBI Headquarters in Washington.\n\n           By the time of that memo, Flemmi โ but not Bulger โ had\n\nbeen closed as an informant.        Officially, the reason for the\n\n\n\n     12\n       Martorano picked up Callahan at the airport and shot him in\nthe back of the head after he entered Martorano's car. Martorano\nand McDonald transferred the body to the trunk of Callahan's car,\nwhere it was discovered after a parking attendant noticed blood\ndripping from the vehicle. 447 F. Supp. 2d at 87 (citing Tr. Day\n2, at 40-41, Flemmi testimony).\n\n                                -11-\n\fclosing was his possible implication in criminal activity unrelated\n\nto the murders.    However, internal communications in the Boston\n\nOffice indicated that the murder investigation prompted his change\n\nin status.    447 F. Supp. 2d at 88 n.59.           Despite his closing,\n\nFlemmi continued to provide significant information to the FBI\n\nthroughout the period until he was re-opened in early July 1986.\n\nMeanwhile, Bulger remained open and, in February 1983, while the\n\nmurder investigations were ongoing, he was designated a \"Top\n\nEchelon\"   informant,   meaning   that   he   was   expected   to   provide\n\ninformation about management-level activity of an organized crime\n\ngroup. Id. at 66. Eventually, the murder investigation wound down\n\nwithout a contemporaneous resolution, despite the forty or so\n\nvolumes of files that had been produced on the crimes.         Tr. Day 13,\n\nat 96, 108 (Montanari testimony).13\n\nC.   FBI Knowledge of Connolly's Conduct\n\n           In its closing argument before the district court, the\n\ngovernment asserted that Bulger and Flemmi were not indicted in\n\nconnection with the murders and other criminal activity until 1995\n\nbecause they were \"very, very smart, and very, very cognizant of\n\n\n\n     13\n        Following an indictment in 1995, Flemmi pled guilty in 2003\nto racketeering acts that included the Castucci, Wheeler, Callahan\nand McIntyre murders. Another Winter Hill member, Kevin Weeks,\npled guilty to racketeering acts that included aiding and abetting\nthe Halloran, Donahue and McIntyre murders. 447 F. Supp. 2d at 59-\n60 nn.5 & 6. Bulger, who was charged with similar crimes, has been\na fugitive since the indictment was issued. See Connolly, 504 F.3d\nat 210.\n\n                                  -12-\n\feverything that was going on around them.\"           Tr.

Other law enforcement representatives had\n\nexpressed concern about the Boston Office's \"too-close association\"\n\nwith members of Winter Hill.       447 F. Supp. 2d at 89.     In a meeting\n\nwith FBI Headquarters representatives in November 1982, Florida\n\nstate and local law enforcement members who were responsible for\n\ninvestigating the Callahan murder reported that they were reluctant\n\nto provide information to the Boston Office because they believed\n\nthe   Winter   Hill   connection   had    been   hindering   that   office's\n\ninvestigation into the murders.          Id.14   The concerns from Florida\n\nwere relayed in a memo from Organized Crime Chief McWeeney to\n\nAssociate Deputy Director Revell:\n\n           Inferences could be drawn from conversations\n           indicating   that   these  state   and   local\n           officials were of the opinion that the FBI had\n           confidential informants within the Winter Hill\n           organization and because of this their efforts\n           against this group were curtailed. In fact,\n           FBI Boston has previously utilized two\n           suspects in this matter as organized crime\n           sources in the Boston Division.\n\n\n      14\n        The Florida representatives also were troubled by the\nassociation between personnel in the FBI's Miami Office and a\nformer Boston Office agent, H. Paul Rico, who at the time of the\nmurders was working as head of security at World Jai Alai. 447 F.\nSupp. 2d at 89. In 1969, Rico had warned Flemmi that he was about\nto be indicted, enabling Flemmi to become a fugitive for five\nyears. Flemmi testified that he returned to Boston in 1974 after\nRico told him he would be protected from prosecution. Id. at 78-\n79; see Tr.

(quoting Ex.\n\n55w, Memo of July 8, 1987).          Connolly was repeatedly recommended\n\nfor salary increases and monetary awards on the basis of his\n\nperformance,16 and he was asked by FBI Headquarters to instruct\n\nother federal agents on the development and handling of informants.\n\nId.

McIntyre's FBI Involvement and Murder\n\n            McIntyre's relationship with the FBI's Boston Office\n\nbegan in the fall of 1984, shortly after the United States Customs\n\nService seized a ship, the Valhalla, on which he was serving as a\n\n\n       16\n       In a Performance Appraisal Report covering the period from\nNovember 15, 1981 through November 12, 1982 โ during which Halloran\nand Callahan were killed โ Connolly was praised for \"develop[ing],\nmaintain[ing], and operat[ing] a corps of extremely high level and\nproductive informants.\"    Ex. 55e.    The Report continued: \"His\ndirection and their resultant information has brought about results\nexceeded by none in the Boston Division's Organized Crime Program.\n. . . His performance has been at the level to which all should\naspire to attain but few will realistically reach.\" A memo from\nthe Boston Office to the Director of the FBI in August 1981 stated\nthat Connolly \"currently operates . . . high-placed informants\nfurnishing information on Organized Crime in the New England area\nand has significantly contributed toward the achievement of the OC\nSquad goals and objectives especially through his skillful\ndirection of high-quality informants.\" Ex. 55h.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fcrew member. The Valhalla had just returned from Ireland, where it\n\nhad delivered an illegal cargo of weapons and ammunition for the\n\nIrish Republican Army (\"IRA\").         McIntyre, one of two crew members\n\non board, had already been cooperating with agents of the Drug\n\nEnforcement Agency (\"DEA\"),17 and the next day, October 17, 1984,\n\nhe met with a Customs agent, Philip Brady, and two FBI officers,\n\nRoderick Kennedy and George Bertram.            Brady and Kennedy were\n\nmembers of the Drug Task Force, which consisted of representatives\n\nfrom Customs, the IRS and the FBI.           Bertram was present at the\n\nmeeting because he covered the IRA for the FBI.        447 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n99.\n\n               During the meeting, McIntyre discussed an upcoming drug\n\nshipment that was expected by Murray, whom customs already knew\n\npaid \"tribute\" โ a fee โ to Bulger so that he could safely operate\n\nhis drug smuggling operation in South Boston.18            Id.     McIntyre\n\nconfirmed       the   Murray-Bulger   connection,   reporting    that   \"'an\n\nindividual named Whitey [a Bulger nickname] who operates a liquor\n\nstore in South Boston became partners with Joe Murray.'\"            Id. at\n\n100.        McIntyre was released after he agreed to cooperate with\n\nCustoms and the FBI in the ongoing investigation into Murray's drug\n\n\n\n       17\n        McIntyre was working at the time for Joe Murray, another\nBoston crime figure who was involved in drug and weapons smuggling.\n       18\n       Bulger and Flemmi collected \"rent\" or tribute from other\ncriminals as payment for the privilege of conducting activity\nwithin territory controlled by them.

On the basis of information he provided, the combined\n\nlaw enforcement agencies seized Murray's next drug load on a ship,\n\nthe Ramsland, as it entered Boston Harbor in mid-November 1984.\n\nMcIntyre was on board as a member of the \"substitute crew\" that had\n\nreplaced the ship's English crew at the mouth of the harbor.     The\n\nship was carrying thirty tons of marijuana, and Flemmi testified\n\nthat he expected to receive $1 million from the shipment's sales\n\nproceeds.   Kevin Weeks, another Winter Hill member, testified that\n\nhe, Bulger and Flemmi each were to receive $3 million.\n\n            After the Ramsland was seized, McIntyre reported to Brady\n\nthat Murray suspected someone in the substitute crew of cooperating\n\nwith law enforcement.    McIntyre did not feel that he was in danger,\n\nand Brady also assumed McIntyre was not at risk because there had\n\nbeen no apparent change in his relationship with Murray.      Id. at\n\n101.   On November 22, a few days after the Ramsland's seizure,\n\nMcIntyre reported to Brady that Pat Nee, a Bulger associate, had\n\noffered him the opportunity to invest $20,000 in a drug smuggling\n\nventure.    Id.   In reality, the \"offer\" was a ruse designed to lure\n\nMcIntyre to meet with Bulger and Flemmi.       Id. at 102.   Customs\n\nprovided McIntyre with the money, and McIntyre delivered it to Nee\n\non November 29.     The next day, Nee brought McIntyre to a house in\n\nSouth Boston, where McIntyre had expected a social gathering.\n\nInstead, Flemmi and Bulger confronted him with their suspicion that\n\nhe had been cooperating with Customs.      After securing McIntyre's\n\n\n                                  -17-\n\fconfession of his complicity with law enforcement, Bulger made an\n\nunsuccessful attempt to strangle him, and then shot and killed him.\n\nId. at 102-104.   Fifteen years later, on January 14, 2000, Weeks\n\nled authorities to McIntyre's makeshift grave.19\n\n           Bulger and Flemmi learned that McIntyre was an informant\n\nfrom Connolly, who had disclosed that one of the two individuals\n\ntaken off the Valhalla was cooperating with law enforcement.\n\nAlthough   Connolly   did   not   identify   McIntyre   by   name,   the\n\ninformation he conveyed was sufficient to reveal his identity to\n\nBulger and Flemmi, who knew that McIntyre had been one of the two\n\npeople on the ship.\n\nE. The FTCA Litigation\n\n           The relationship between the Winter Hill gang and the\n\nBoston Office of the FBI was publicly exposed in 1999 in a lengthy\n\nopinion issued by Judge Mark Wolf of the Massachusetts District\n\nCourt in United States v. Salemme, 91 F. Supp. 2d 141 (D. Mass.\n\n1999), rev'd in part, 225 F.3d 78 (1st Cir. 2000).20            In his\n\n\n     19\n       McIntyre originally was buried in the basement of the house\nwhere he was killed, next to another Bulger-Flemmi murder victim,\nArthur Barrett. See Barrett v. United States, 462 F.3d 28, 30 (1st\nCir. 2006).    A third victim, Deborah Hussey, was murdered and\nburied in the house in early 1985. The remains of all three were\nremoved on Halloween night in 1985, when it appeared that the house\nwas about to be sold, and they were re-buried in Dorchester. 447\nF. Supp. 2d at 104 n.88.\n     20\n       Francis Salemme was an associate of Bulger and Flemmi, and\nhe was indicted with them and others in January 1995 for varied\norganized crime activities. Judge Wolf presided over the complex\nproceedings in that case. The opinion cited above reviewed the\n\n                                  -18-\n\fdecision, Judge Wolf outlined a possible pattern of corruption\n\ninvolving Bulger, Flemmi, Connolly and at least one of Connolly's\n\nFBI   supervisors,     John   Morris.      Judge   Wolf    speculated    in   his\n\nopinion that Connolly may have disclosed McIntyre's identity to\n\nBulger and Flemmi.      Id. at 213; see also McIntyre v. United States,\n\n367 F.3d 38, 40 (1st Cir. 2004).\n\n              Five months later, in January 2000, McIntyre's body was\n\nrecovered.       On   May   25,   2000,   McIntyre's   estate,    through     its\n\nadministrator      (McIntyre's      mother,    Emily      McIntyre)     and   co-\n\nadministrator (his brother, Christopher McIntyre),21 filed this\n\naction against the United States under the Federal Tort Claims\n\nAct.22     The statute provides that the United States may be sued for\n\nmoney damages for personal injury or death caused by the negligent\n\nor otherwise wrongful acts or omissions of its employees while\n\nacting within the scope of their office or employment.                28 U.S.C.\n\n\n\n\nbackground of Flemmi's and Bulger's relationship with the FBI,\ndescribing many of the same incidents detailed in the district\ncourt's opinion in this case. Much of the analysis in Judge Wolf's\nopinion was devoted to Flemmi's motions to dismiss the charges\nagainst him and to suppress statements he had made to the FBI based\non FBI promises of immunity.\n      21\n       For convenience, we at times will refer to the plaintiffs\nin this case as McIntyre.\n      22\n       McIntyre also asserted claims against Bulger, Flemmi, Weeks\nand eight former agents of the Boston Office of the FBI, including\nConnolly. The district court bifurcated the trial of the claims\nagainst the United States from the trial of the individual claims,\nand only the case against the government is before us.\n\n                                      -19-\n\fยง 1346.23 The McIntyre claim was premised on multiple theories: (1)\n\nthat    the   FBI   directly   caused   McIntyre's   death   when   Connolly\n\ninformed Bulger and Flemmi that McIntyre was cooperating with\n\nauthorities, foreseeably leading to his murder, (2) that the agency\n\nindirectly caused his death through the protection its agents\n\nafforded Bulger and Flemmi, which encouraged and enabled them to\n\ncommit murders, including McIntyre's, and (3) that other agents\n\nnegligently supervised Connolly, failing to take corrective action\n\neven though they knew or should have known that Connolly was\n\nleaking information to Bulger and Flemmi and protecting them from\n\ninvestigation, arrest and prosecution.         McIntyre, 367 F.3d at 41;\n\nMcIntyre, 447 F. Supp. 2d at 59.        The claims proceeded to trial on\n\nJune 5, 2006.24\n\n\n       23\n       The FTCA is a limited waiver of the federal government's\nsovereign immunity, granting federal courts jurisdiction over\nclaims that fall within its scope. These include claims\n\n       for injury or loss of property, or personal injury or\n       death caused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission\n       of any employee of the Government while acting within the\n       scope of his office or employment, under circumstances\n       where the United States, if a private person, would be\n       liable to the claimant in accordance with the law of the\n       place where the act or omission occurred.\n\n28 U.S.C. ยง 1346(b)(1).\n       24\n       The district court had granted the government's motion to\ndismiss McIntyre's action as untimely on the ground that the\nprerequisite administrative claim was not filed within two years of\naccrual, as required by the FTCA, 28 U.S.C. ยง 2401(b). We reversed\nthe dismissal and remanded after concluding that the factual\npredicate for McIntyre's claims could not reasonably have been\nknown earlier.

The court found the\n\nUnited States responsible for McIntyre's death \"because Connolly,\n\nacting within the scope of his employment, disclosed information to\n\nBulger and Flemmi sufficient for them to identify McIntyre as a\n\ngovernment    informant,    and    McIntyre's      death   was    a   foreseeable\n\nconsequence of that disclosure.\"           447 F. Supp. 2d at 60.        As noted\n\nabove, the court awarded McIntyre's estate approximately $3.1\n\nmillion in damages.25\n\n                                         II.\n\n             An FTCA suit may be brought only if the conduct on which\n\nthe action is based would support a cause of action against a\n\nprivate person under \"the law of the place where the act or\n\nomission occurred.\"       28 U.S.C. ยง 1346(b)(1); McCloskey v. Mueller,\n\n446   F.3d   262,   266   (1st    Cir.    2006).     In    this   instance,   the\n\napplicable state law is the Massachusetts wrongful death statute,\n\nwhich allows recovery for deaths caused by negligence.                 Mass.

United States, 141 F.3d 8,\n\n13 (1st Cir. 1998).\n\n\n\n\n      25\n       The damages consisted of $3 million for McIntyre's conscious\nsuffering during the few minutes that Bulger attempted to strangle\nand then shot him, $100,000 for his mother's loss of consortium,\nand $1,876 in funeral and burial expenses.\n\n                                     -21-\n\f            To   succeed   with    such   a     claim   under    the   FTCA,   the\n\nplaintiff must satisfy the state's standard for tort liability.\n\nMitchell, 141 F.3d at 13.            Under      Massachusetts law, \"a tort\n\nplaintiff must show that (1) the defendant owed him a duty, (2) the\n\ndefendant   breached    that      duty,   (3)    the    breach   constituted     a\n\nproximate cause of the ensuing harm, and (4) the breach caused\n\nactual injury.\"      Fithian v.

Kask, 849\n\nN.E.2d 829, 834-35 (Mass. 2006).\n\n            In its appeal of the district court's ruling, the United\n\nStates presents a narrow challenge:26 it claims that the court erred\n\nonly in concluding that Connolly's leak of McIntyre's identity fell\n\nwithin the scope of his employment for the FBI, the prerequisite to\n\nliability against the United States under the FTCA.               See 28 U.S.C.\n\nยง 1346(b)(1) (providing recovery \"for personal injury or death\n\ncaused by the negligent or wrongful act or omission of any employee\n\nof the Government while acting within the scope of his office or\n\nemployment\").     The government does not take issue with the court's\n\nfindings on the state-law elements of the FTCA claim: that Connolly\n\nhad a duty to protect McIntyre from harm at the hands of Bulger and\n\nFlemmi because of his informant status, id. at 106-108, that\n\n\n\n     26\n       Both parties also have appealed, on different grounds, the\ncalculation of post-judgment interest on the damages award.\nNeither party disputes the assertion of the other, and we therefore\ntouch on that issue only briefly in Section III below.\n\n                                     -22-\n\fdisclosure of McIntyre's identity as an informant breached that\n\nduty, id. at 108, and that McIntyre's murder was a foreseeable risk\n\nof that disclosure, id. at 111.           Accordingly, we confine our\n\ndiscussion to the scope of employment question.\n\nA. Legal Principles\n\n            Whether an employee is acting within the scope of his\n\nemployment for purposes of the FTCA is determined by the law of the\n\nstate in which the relevant conduct occurred.        Aversa v. United\n\nStates, 99 F.3d 1200, 1209 (1st Cir. 1996).       Under Massachusetts\n\nlaw, an employee's conduct is within the scope of his or her\n\nemployment if (1) it is of the kind the employee was hired to\n\nperform, (2) it occurs within \"authorized time and space limits,\"\n\nand (3) \"'it is motivated, at least in part, by a purpose to serve\n\nthe employer.'\"    Pinshaw v. Metro. Dist. Comm'n, 524 N.E.2d 1351,\n\n1356 (Mass. 1988) (quoting Wang Labs., Inc. v.

Jerez, 457 N.E.2d 1105, 1108 (Mass. 1983),27\n\n\n     27\n          In Jerez, the court observed:\n\n     We long have recognized that acts not strictly necessary\n     for fulfilment of an agent's duties nonetheless may fall\n     within the agent's scope of employment. The scope of an\n     agent's authority is not construed restrictively in this\n     Commonwealth, and on several occasions we have considered\n\n                                 -23-\n\fand it may extend beyond the employee's explicit authority, Howard,\n\n506 N.E.2d at 105.   \"[I]t is ordinarily the actual and customary,\n\nrather than formally described, duties which determine scope of\n\nemployment.\"   Id. at 105-106.    In elaborating on the employer's\n\nresponsibility for unauthorized acts, the Massachusetts Supreme\n\nJudicial Court observed:\n\n          \"If the act complained of was within the scope\n          of the servant's authority, the master will be\n          liable, although it constituted an abuse or\n          excess of the authority conferred.

We note that Massachusetts courts\nroutinely rely on the Restatement in examining scope-of-employment\nquestions. See, e.g., Clickner, 663 N.E.2d at 855; Pinshaw, 524\nN.E.2d at 1356; Howard, 506 N.E.2d at 106; Wang,501 N.E.2d at 1166-\n67.\n     29\n       The other relevant factors listed in ยง 229(2) are: whether\nthe act is commonly done by such employees; the time, place and\npurpose of the act; the previous relations between the employer and\nemployee; the extent to which the employer's work is apportioned\namong different employees; whether the act is outside the\nemployer's business or has not been entrusted to any employee; and\nwhether the instrumentality by which the harm is done has been\nfurnished by the employer.\n\n                                     -25-\n\fB.    The District Court Decision and the Standard of Review\n\n            The district court concluded that Connolly's leak of\n\nMcIntyre's identity to Bulger and Flemmi was within the scope of\n\nhis   employment   as   an   FBI   agent    because   \"[t]he   management   of\n\ninformants was both a formal job requirement and an actual and\n\ncustomary duty of FBI agents,\" 447 F. Supp. 2d at 108, and\n\ncommunicating with informants was the \"'kind of conduct [Connolly]\n\nwas employed to perform,'\" 447 F. Supp. 2d at 109 (quoting Wang,\n\n501 N.E.2d at 1166).         In explaining its conclusion, the court\n\ncited, inter alia, Connolly's long relationship with Bulger and\n\nFlemmi and his responsibility to obtain information from them,\n\nwhich required Connolly to \"maintain his relationship with them and\n\ncultivate their goodwill.\"         Id.   The court also noted the decades\n\nof protection afforded to Bulger and Flemmi by the FBI, reflecting\n\ntheir high value to the agency, and it pointed as well to the\n\nagency's repeated endorsement of Connolly's handling of informants.\n\nId.\n\n            In discussing the third prong of the Massachusetts test\n\nโ motivation โ the court began by explicitly crediting Flemmi's\n\ntestimony that he and Bulger gave Connolly in excess of $200,000\n\nbetween 1981 and 1990.          Id. at 110.       The court acknowledged\n\nConnolly's personal interest in keeping Bulger and Flemmi happy,\n\nand found that the leak about McIntyre's identity was partially\n\nmotivated by greed and the desire to maintain his friendship with\n\n\n                                     -26-\n\fthe two men.     Id. at 111.           However, the court also found that he\n\nwas \"motivated, at least in part, by a desire to promote the FBI's\n\ngoal of taking down Cosa Nostra through the use of Bulger and\n\nFlemmi as informants.\"           Id.\n\n            We review the scope of employment determination de novo.\n\nAversa,    99   F.3d    at   1210.       The    underlying   factual   findings,\n\nincluding the court's determination of Connolly's motive, are\n\nreviewed for clear error.           See Reyelt v. Danzell, 533 F.3d 28, 31\n\n(1st Cir. 2008) (\"[T]he [district] court's factual findings are\n\nreviewed only for clear error . . . .\"); Aversa, 99 F.3d at 1212-13\n\n(noting that district court \"justifiably could find\" that employee\n\nintended, \"at least in part and although misguidedly, to serve an\n\nobjective of his employer\").\n\nC. Discussion\n\n            The government argues that the United States may not be\n\nheld responsible for McIntyre's death because Connolly \"departed in\n\n[]   an   extreme      fashion    from    any   recognized   boundary    of   the\n\nemployment concept . . . , committ[ing] the most fundamental and\n\nheinous betrayal of his job.\" In the government's view, Connolly's\n\naction was \"the opposite of the scope of employment.\"              In the terms\n\nof the multi-prong framework of Massachusetts law, the United\n\nStates maintains that leaking McIntire's identity was neither the\n\n\n\n\n                                         -27-\n\fkind of conduct Connolly was hired to perform (prong one) nor\n\nmotivated by a purpose to serve the FBI (prong three).30\n\n             In support of its view, the government cites numerous\n\nways    in   which    Connolly's   action       was   at    odds   with   the   FBI's\n\ninterests.      It emphasizes that the leak of an informant's identity\n\nis   contrary    to    explicit    FBI    policy,31    it    violated     Connolly's\n\nEmployment Agreement with the FBI,32 and such a disclosure would\n\njeopardize the agency's continuing ability to recruit informants โ\n\nwho are a crucial tool in the FBI's investigatory efforts.                        The\n\ngovernment additionally characterizes Connolly's leak of McIntyre's\n\nidentity as a form of theft or embezzlement that he committed in\n\nexchange for the money and other gifts provided by Bulger and\n\n\n       30\n        Prong two โ requiring that the conduct occur \"within\nauthorized time and space limits\" โ warrants little discussion.\nThere is no dispute that Connolly was the handler for Bulger and\nFlemmi when he disclosed McIntyre's identity, and his job was not\nconfined to specific hours or locations. Consequently, prong two\nis easily satisfied.\n       31\n       The FBI's Manual of Investigative Operations and Guidelines\ncautioned that agents must take care in handling informants \"to\ninsure that they are not provided any information other than that\nnecessary to carry out their assignments.\" See Ex. 6, Guidelines,\nยง 137-3(8) (1978).\n       32\n        The agreement that Connolly signed acknowledges his\nunderstanding that \"unauthorized disclosure of information in the\nfiles of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the\nFBI could . . . prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its\nresponsibilities,\" and he agreed never to \"divulge, publish, or\nreveal either by word or conduct . . . to any unauthorized\nrecipient without official written authorization by the Director of\nthe FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory\nfiles of the FBI . . . or disclose any information . . . acquired\nas a part of the performance of my official duties.\"\n\n                                         -28-\n\fFlemmi, and it argues that taking bribes to steal from an employer\n\ncan never constitute conduct within the scope of employment.\n\n          As to motivation, the government highlights Connolly's\n\nconviction for collaborating with Bulger and Flemmi, and argues\n\nthat the McIntyre leak was motivated solely by his desire to\n\nfurther their joint criminal enterprise and to protect them from\n\nprosecution.   The government argues that there is no evidence that\n\nConnolly's   revelation   of    McIntyre's     identity     was   in   any   way\n\nintended to further the interests of the FBI; rather, it was in\n\nkeeping with other acts of betrayal that he committed to advance\n\nhis personal interests at the expense of the FBI and its mission.\n\n          Connolly's role as Bulger's and Flemmi's handler cannot,\n\nthe government insists, place all of his interactions with them\n\nwithin the scope of his employment.          Protecting them at any cost โ\n\nand facilitating McIntyre's murder โ was not the sort of conduct he\n\nwas hired to perform.          The government's view is perhaps best\n\nsummarized by its statement at oral argument that, by the time of\n\nthe McIntyre leak, \"this guy [had] crossed to the other side; he\n\nwas a criminal who had a day job as an FBI agent.\"\n\n          We understand the government's perspective.                  Connolly\n\ntook advantage of his law enforcement status to form a corrupt\n\nrelationship   with   Bulger    and    Flemmi.     As   a   general     matter,\n\ndisclosing an informant's identity to violent criminals who have a\n\npenchant for murdering people whom they consider a threat seems far\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\foutside the range of conduct Connolly was employed to perform. The\n\nMcIntyre leak violated a bright-line law enforcement rule that\n\ninformant identity never be revealed, and put at risk the life of\n\nan individual who was helping the FBI.        There is some appeal in the\n\ngovernment's position that such conduct is categorically outside\n\nthe scope of an FBI agent's employment and that, consequently, it\n\ncould   only   be   motivated   by   Connolly's   desire   to   advance   his\n\nlucrative, unlawful second \"career.\"\n\n           The government's depiction of the case, however, fails to\n\nacknowledge its extraordinary context.            The factors it lists in\n\narguing that Connolly's disclosure of McIntyre's identity fell\n\noutside the scope of his employment โ including the contractual and\n\npolicy prohibitions on leaks, the \"'seriously criminal'\" nature of\n\nhis action, and its \"extreme 'departure from the normal method of\n\n[handling informants],'\" Reply Brief at 8 (quoting Restatement\n\n(Second) of Agency, ยง 229(2)(j),(i)) โ paint Connolly as a lone\n\nrenegade whose outrageous, unprecedented behavior could not have\n\nbeen anticipated by his superiors.          This assessment of Connolly's\n\nconduct is unduly narrow.\n\n           Although it is undisputed that Connolly had no explicit\n\nauthority to disclose McIntyre's identity, we must look to his\n\n\"actual and customary\" duties to determine if the leak may be\n\nconsidered within the scope of his employment.         Howard, 506 N.E.2d\n\nat 105-106; see also Potter, 463 F.3d at 26;.         As we shall explain,\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fwe agree with the district court that Connolly's disclosure was\n\nwithin the boundaries of the FBI's longstanding method of handling\n\nBulger and Flemmi through Connolly, and that it consequently is\n\n\"'just'\" to treat the harm caused by the disclosure \"'as one of the\n\nnormal risks to be borne by the business in which the servant is\n\nemployed,'\" Croes v. United States, 726 F.2d 31, 32-33 (1st Cir.\n\n1984) (quoting Restatement (Second) of Agency, ยง 229 (cmt. a)).\n\n            1.    Prong One: Kind of Employment\n\n            The FBI as an institution had selected La Cosa Nostra as\n\nits highest priority, and it correctly viewed Bulger and Flemmi as\n\nuniquely effective tools in dismantling Winter Hill's organized\n\ncrime competitor.         As a result, the two men received kid-glove\n\ntreatment from all levels of the FBI for decades.                 The district\n\ncourt recounts in great detail that suspicions about Bulger's and\n\nFlemmi's    involvement     in   serious    crimes    were   repeatedly    left\n\nunexplored   or    were    pursued   minimally,      and   the   FBI   routinely\n\ndeparted from the agency's regulations when working with them โ\n\npresumably to assure that they would remain available to provide\n\ncritical LCN intelligence.\n\n            Examples of this deferential handling of Bulger and\n\nFlemmi abound in the record.            They include judgments made by\n\nHeadquarters personnel as well as by supervisors in the Boston\n\nOffice.    Among them are the following, some of which we previously\n\nhave described in more detail:\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\f           (1) Bulger and Flemmi were removed from a 1979 indictment\n\ncharging a scheme to fix horse races, and listed only as unindicted\n\nco-conspirators,     after    a   request     by   Connolly      and    his   then-\n\nsupervisor,   John   Morris,      because     of   their    value      to   the   LCN\n\ninvestigation.   447 F. Supp. 2d at 80;33\n\n           (2) At the Washington and Boston meetings in May 1982,\n\nhigh level FBI officials decided to retain Bulger and Flemmi as\n\nopen informants despite suspicions about their roles in the Wheeler\n\nand Halloran murders.        Id. at 87;\n\n           (3) In response to a 1983 request from the Oklahoma City\n\nOffice of the FBI that Bulger and Flemmi's informant files be\n\nexamined for reports of activity around the time of the Wheeler and\n\nCallahan murders, Connolly wrote a report โ two years after the\n\nWheeler murder and a year after Callahan's โ establishing alibis\n\nfor Bulger for both dates.             Connolly's supervisors apparently\n\naccepted   the   report      without    questioning        its   delay,     despite\n\nConnolly's conspicuous violation of FBI guidelines requiring a much\n\nprompter report under the circumstances.             Id. at 90-91;34\n\n\n     33\n       At the time, neither Bulger nor Flemmi was officially open\nas an informant. 447 F. Supp. 2d at 80.\n     34\n       The district court found that Connolly discussed the alibi\nfor the Wheeler death with Bulger shortly after the murder, telling\nBulger that if he were implicated in the killing, Connolly would\nsay that he and Bulger had spoken by telephone the night of the\nmurder and that Bulger was in Boston, not in Oklahoma City, at that\ntime. The memo Connolly prepared two years later provided just\nsuch an alibi. 447 F. Supp. 2d at 82 (citing Ex. 111, Memo from\nConnolly to SAC).    The Manual of Investigative Operations and\n\n                                       -32-\n\f           (4) When Bulger and Flemmi eventually were interviewed\n\nabout the murders following an inquiry from the Tulsa Police\n\nDepartment,      they   were    interviewed    together    at    the    pair's\n\ninsistence, contrary to standard procedures.            Id. at 91;\n\n           (5) The Boston Office files contained many references to\n\nBulger's   and    Flemmi's     involvement    between   1965    and    1987   in\n\nloansharking and bookmaking, crimes that should have triggered\n\ninvestigations into their suitability to remain informants. Id. at\n\n76-78 & n.41.      Even during periods when Flemmi was closed as an\n\ninformant, he was treated as an informant, and during one closed\n\nstretch in 1983, an agent who wanted to interview him approached\n\nhim through Connolly. Id. at 74 (citing Tr. Day 13, at 105-107,\n\nMontanari testimony);35\n\n           (6) James Greenleaf, the SAC of the Boston Office from\n\nNovember 1982 through October 1986, testified that investigations\n\nof Bulger and Flemmi by other law enforcement agencies \"just didn't\n\nregister\" with him. This lack of attention to the growing evidence\n\n\n\nGuidelines requires that contacts with informants be recorded in\nthe informant's file at or near the time they occurred. Ex. 6,\nGuidelines ยง 137-8(1) (1981) (\"All information pertinent to our\ninvestigative responsibilities furnished by informants must be\npromptly reviewed, recorded, indexed, evaluated, channelized, and\nall other necessary action taken.\").\n     35\n       The continuity of the relationship violated FBI guidelines.\nThe MIOG requires that, when an informant is closed because he is\n\"no longer suitable to provide information or operational\nassistance, his relationship with the Bureau shall be promptly\nterminated.\" Ex. 6, ยง 137-17, Guidelines Part D(7).\n\n                                    -33-\n\fof the pair's involvement in serious criminal activity allowed him\n\nto avoid meaningful suitability reviews of their status.     See Tr.\n\nDay 14, at 104.36\n\n           Although the United States asserts that Bulger and Flemmi\n\nescaped prosecution and retained their informant status, sometimes\n\nunofficially, because none of the FBI's suspicions were validated\n\nby concrete evidence, the record supports the district court's\n\nobservation that \"the FBI was not pounding the pavement looking for\n\nevidence that could 'stick.'    Instead, the FBI stuck its head in\n\nthe sand when it came to the criminal activities of Bulger and\n\nFlemmi.\"   447 F. Supp. 2d at 93.37    Indeed, the deference paid to\n\nBulger and Flemmi did not go unnoticed by the two men.        Flemmi\n\n\n     36\n        Greenleaf testified that a suitability review should be\nconducted in response to reports of serious criminal activity, but\nno suitability review was conducted for Bulger and Flemmi during\nhis tenure as SAC of the Boston Office. Tr. Day 14, at 53-54. He\nstated that he had received no report that they were involved in\nsuch activity. Id.\n     37\n       Soon after Fitzpatrick arrived in the Boston Office in 1981,\nhe met with Bulger and subsequently recommended to Lawrence\nSarhatt, the SAC of the Boston Office from 1980 until November\n1982, that he be closed as an informant.       Fitzpatrick thought\nSarhatt agreed with him:\n\n     I felt . . . that he went along with it. But whatever\n     happened thereafter, there were other intervening cases,\n     LCN, and so forth that intruded, and we went on with\n     other stuff.\n\nTr. Day 8, at 17.      However, when Fitzpatrick made the same\nrecommendation to McWeeney, the FBI's Organized Crime Chief,\nMcWeeney \"started telling me how valuable Mr. Bulger was.\" Id. at\n21. Fitzpatrick understood that it was a Headquarters decision to\nkeep Bulger open. Id. at 25.\n\n                                -34-\n\ftestified that the agents in the Boston Office treated him and\n\nBulger like colleagues, \"'like we were FBI agents.'\"              Id. at 91\n\nn.65 (quoting Tr. June 6, 2006, at 93-94).\n\n          Moreover, Connolly's disclosure of McIntyre's identity\n\nwas neither his first nor only leak of sensitive information, and\n\nthe FBI repeatedly was told of concerns that Connolly was a source\n\nof leaked information.     In December 1976, Connolly learned that\n\nCastucci had provided information to the FBI about the whereabouts\n\nof two Winter Hill members.    He told Bulger, who promptly arranged\n\nCastucci's    murder.   Id.   at   79.    The   Boston   Office    received\n\ninformation from more than one source that Bulger and Flemmi had\n\nkilled Castucci, id., but apparently never asked Connolly if he\n\nknew anything about the circumstances of the murder, id. at 80\n\nn.44.\n\n          We previously have described the concerns expressed by\n\nlocal law enforcement authorities in Massachusetts and Florida\n\nconcerning leaks from the Boston Office and from Connolly in\n\nparticular.    Although this knowledge of local concerns went to the\n\nhighest levels of the FBI, the record shows no meaningful follow-\n\nup, even after Halloran's explicit report that someone in the\n\nBoston Office was leaking information to Bulger and Flemmi. Id. at\n\n83 & n.49;38 see also id. at 95 n.71 (noting the concerns \"as early\n\n\n     38\n       At trial, Agent Montanari testified that, despite Halloran's\nreport about a leak in the Boston Office during the time he was\ninvestigating the murders, he did not believe anyone in the office\n\n                                   -35-\n\fas 1982 that Bulger and Flemmi might be obtaining information\n\nconcerning investigations of their criminal activities from the\n\nBoston     Office   itself\");    Tr.    Day     9,   at    39-40        (Fitzpatrick\n\ntestimony).       Fitzpatrick testified that he was informed by SAC\n\nSarhatt upon Fitzpatrick's arrival in Boston in 1981 that Connolly\n\nand his supervisor, Morris, might have leaked information to Bulger\n\nand   Flemmi   that    compromised      an    investigation        by    state   law\n\nenforcement authorities.        Tr. Day 7, at 61.         Fitzpatrick also had\n\nbeen told by FBI Assistant Director McKinnon, who was based at FBI\n\nHeadquarters, that there were problems in the Boston Office. Asked\n\nat trial if he investigated whether Connolly was \"the pipeline\" for\n\nBulger and Flemmi, Fitzpatrick responded that \"[i]t wasn't part of\n\nthe purview at that time.        That was not part of the investigation\n\nat that time.\"      Tr. Day 9, at 40.\n\n            Greenleaf, the SAC beginning in November 1982, testified\n\nthat he was not focused on the reports that Bulger and Flemmi had\n\nsources    within   law   enforcement        generally    or   within      the   FBI,\n\nalthough he was concerned that they were receiving information\n\nabout investigations into their activities.               Tr. Day 14, at 119.\n\nHe knew of no investigation being conducted in response to those\n\nreports.    Id.\n\n\n\n\nwas improperly disclosing information. Tr. Day 13, at 110. He\nsaid he did not give \"any credence\" to rumors from other police\nagencies expressing distrust of Connolly. Id.\n\n                                       -36-\n\f            Instead,    as    the    other    law   enforcement       departments\n\nexpressed their concerns about Connolly's relationship with Bulger\n\nand Flemmi, Connolly was being highly praised by his superiors for\n\nhis handling of informants.          As described supra, he consistently\n\nwas given the highest possible ratings for his overall performance\n\nand his work with informants, even after questions arose about\n\nwhether he might be Bulger's and Flemmi's \"pipeline.\"\n\n            We recognize that not every agent in the FBI's Boston\n\nOffice condoned Connolly's tactics or ignored every allegation of\n\nserious criminal behavior by Bulger and Flemmi.              To the contrary,\n\nSAC Sarhatt looked into allegations of leaks related to a wiretap\n\nin the late 1970s and, in a personal interview of Bulger, asked if\n\nhe had received any information from a member of the FBI.                 Bulger\n\nresponded negatively.         Id. at 83 n.49.       Fitzpatrick, who was in\n\ncharge of the C-3 Squad through the mid-1980s, testified that he\n\nlocked up investigative files on the Wheeler murder after Agents\n\nMontanari and Brunnick expressed concerns that Connolly had been\n\nrifling through the material and passing information along to\n\nBulger.     Tr. Day 7, at 21-24.39           Brunnick and Montanari amassed\n\nsubstantial files on the Wheeler-Halloran-Donahue-Callahan murders\n\nin   what   appears    to    have   been,    on   their   part,   a   good-faith\n\ninvestigation that was frustrated by the Boston Office's collegial\n\n\n      39\n       Montanari testified that he never told Fitzpatrick about\nConnolly rifling through his files and did not remember Brunnick\nexpressing such a concern. Tr. Day 13, at 89.\n\n                                      -37-\n\frelationship with Bulger and Flemmi.40            Supervisor Ring chastised\n\nConnolly for being overly friendly with Bulger and Flemmi and\n\ninstructed him to stop meeting with informants at his own home.\n\nId. at 98; Tr. Day 16, at 76, 80 (Ring testimony).                      But such\n\ndiscrete expressions of concern about Connolly's interactions with\n\nthe   pair   and    their   possible    involvement    in   serious     criminal\n\nactivity do not dispel the dominant impression created by the\n\nrecord     that    the   FBI,   both   within   the   Boston   Office    and   at\n\nHeadquarters in Washington, engaged for years in a strategy that\n\ngave Connolly wide berth in his interactions with Bulger and\n\nFlemmi.\n\n             The United States argues that, even conceding that the\n\nFBI took some steps to preserve the flow of information from Bulger\n\nand Flemmi, Connolly's disclosure of McIntyre's identity โ leading\n\nforeseeably to his death โ was \"dramatically different from all of\n\nthe other acts cited by the plaintiffs\" and directly contrary to\n\nthe FBI's interests.        That assertion does not fairly reflect the\n\nrecord.      As we have described, Connolly had revealed sensitive\n\ninformation in the past, including the identity of informants. FBI\n\nHeadquarters knew that other law enforcement agencies suspected\n\nConnolly of being the leak in the Boston Office, but it made no\n\n\n\n      40\n       The district court commented that \"the investigation is more\nnotable for what was not done than for what was done,\" including\nthe absence of \"serious interrogation of the prime suspects, Bulger\nand Flemmi.\" Id. at 93.\n\n                                       -38-\n\feffort to seriously investigate the allegations or to terminate\n\nConnolly's relationship with Bulger and Flemmi.    Unquestionably,\n\nthe disclosure at issue in this case was officially unauthorized\n\nand forbidden.   However, it was not outside Connolly's customary\n\nrange of activity.   Even if we accept that the FBI's failure to\n\nseriously investigate the allegations against Connolly, and to\n\ninstead praise his abilities, does not constitute tacit approval of\n\nhis methods, the agency's attitude at least reflects a judgment\n\nthat Connolly's at-the-edge conduct could be tolerated for the\n\ngreater good of bringing down La Cosa Nostra. McIntyre's death was\n\none of the consequences of that attitude.\n\n          The United States argues that deeming Connolly's leak to\n\nbe within the scope of his employment leads inevitably to the\n\nconclusion that Connolly also would have been acting within the\n\nscope of his employment if he had shot McIntyre himself.      That\n\ndramatic argument ignores the claim actually before us. Nothing in\n\nthis record suggests that Connolly committed acts of violence\n\nhimself that were condoned by the FBI.   By contrast, the leak of\n\nMcIntyre's identity fell within the range of activity that had\n\nbecome customary for Connolly without reprisal from his superiors\n\n-- despite their awareness that he may be engaging in such conduct.\n\nAt some point, unauthorized conduct will cross the line between\n\nacts that fall within the employee's scope of employment and those\n\nthat are so far removed from the employer's methods and purposes\n\n\n                               -39-\n\fthat they fall outside it.             The question here was where on the\n\nspectrum to place Connolly's leak of McIntyre's identity.                  For the\n\nreasons we have discussed, we hold that the scope of Connolly's\n\nemployment was broad enough to encompass this kind of conduct.\n\n                2.    Prong Three: Motivation\n\n                The   district   court    did    not   commit   clear     error   in\n\nconcluding that Connolly's favors to Bulger and Flemmi โ including\n\nhis unauthorized disclosure of confidential information โ were\n\nmotivated at least in part by a desire to advance the FBI's agenda.\n\nSee 447 F. Supp. 2d at 111.41            Through his connection with Bulger\n\nand Flemmi, Connolly was able to simultaneously help the FBI\n\nsucceed in its efforts against LCN and help Bulger and Flemmi in\n\ntheir        quest    to   control   organized    crime   in    Boston,    thereby\n\nsolidifying his status in both realms.                 Connolly received both\n\nsalary increases and monetary awards from the FBI on the basis of\n\nhis performance, which, as we have explained, was highly praised\n\n\n\n\n        41\n        After noting that he credited Flemmi's testimony that\nConnolly received more than $200,000 in cash and gifts from Bulger\nand Flemmi, the district court explicitly found that \"Connolly was\nmotivated in part by greed and his friendship with Flemmi and\nespecially Bulger.\"    447 F. Supp. 2d at 111.     The court then\nrejected the notion that Connolly's motivations were \"purely\npersonal.\"   Id. (emphasis omitted).    Relying on its extensive\nreview of the decades-long history of Connolly's relationship with\nthe two men, the court stated: \"For reasons already discussed, I\nfind that Connolly was motivated, at least in part, by a desire to\npromote the FBI's goal of taking down Cosa Nostra through the use\nof Bulger and Flemmi as informants.\" Id.\n\n                                         -40-\n\fbecause of his success in working with Bulger and Flemmi.                        Id. at\n\n97.\n\n            The government points out that the record contains no\n\ndirect evidence that Connolly intended to benefit the FBI by\n\nrevealing McIntyre's identity, and it emphasizes that every law\n\nenforcement officer who testified stated that leaking informant\n\nidentity is always harmful to investigating agencies. However, the\n\ndistrict court did not have to find that identifying McIntyre was\n\nitself in the FBI's interest. Providing Bulger and Flemmi with any\n\nconfidential     information      of     use    to    them    would   reinforce     the\n\nrelationship between Connolly and his informants and invite their\n\ncontinued reciprocity with information about LCN.                      Thus, even if\n\nConnolly understood that revealing an informant's identity might in\n\nthe   abstract   harm     the    FBI's    future      ability    to   recruit     other\n\ninformants, that does not diminish the immediate benefit Connolly\n\nwould    perceive   for    the    FBI    from    his    efforts       to   get   useful\n\ninformation about LCN from these individuals.                   Such a cost-benefit\n\nanalysis seems particularly rational in the context of the FBI's\n\nnational priority to eliminate LCN.                  See id. at 62 (citing April\n\n23, 1980 memo from FBI Director to Attorney General).\n\n            Hence, the facts of this case are unlike those in the\n\ncases cited by the government as examples of employee conduct that\n\nis not fairly attributed to the employer.                    The circumstances here\n\nare     easily   distinguishable,          for       example,     from      a    simple\n\n\n                                         -41-\n\fembezzlement, see In re American Biomaterials Corp., 954 F.2d 919,\n\n924-25 (3d Cir. 1992), from a day care center employee's sexual\n\nassault of children, Worcester Ins. Co. v. Fells Acres Day Sch.,\n\n558 N.E.2d 958, 967 (Mass. 1990), and from the robbery and murder\n\nof a courier by customs agents, Attallah v. United States, 955 F.2d\n\n776, 781 (1st Cir. 1992).         In none of these cases is there a\n\nplausible   theory   that   the   employee's   action    could   have   been\n\nmotivated in part by the employer's interests.          See 447 F. Supp.2d\n\nat 111 n.96 (distinguishing Atallah and similar cases because\n\n\"there is no obvious way in which the employees' motivations would\n\noverlap\" with those of the employers).         Nor does the $200,000 in\n\nmoney and gifts that Connolly received from Bulger and Flemmi\n\nrequire a finding that the McIntyre leak was solely a personal\n\nendeavor.    The record does not suggest that Connolly received\n\npayments for particular tips, but rather that he received periodic\n\nrewards as part of the ongoing relationship that the FBI expected\n\nhim to nurture.42    The district court therefore permissibly found\n\nthat the McIntyre disclosure was partially motivated by Connolly's\n\ndesire to maintain his relationship with Bulger and Flemmi in order\n\nto further the FBI's effort to dismantle La Cosa Nostra.\n\n\n\n\n     42\n       Flemmi testified that he exchanged money and gifts with\nmultiple members of the C-3 Squad to maintain \"goodwill and\nprotection.\" Tr. Day 2, at 93-104.\n\n                                   -42-\n\f           3. Conclusion on Scope of Employment\n\n           In agreeing with the district court that the FBI is\n\nresponsible for McIntyre's death as the foreseeable consequence of\n\nConnolly's leak, we do not suggest that such an outcome was desired\n\nor even contemplated by Connolly's superiors.           Moreover, contrary\n\nto the government's suggestion, this outcome is not a judgment\n\nthat the government's interests were in fact advanced by McIntyre's\n\nmurder.   Our conclusion, like the district court's, is only that\n\ndisclosure of McIntyre's identity was in keeping with both the\n\ndeferential treatment Bulger and Flemmi regularly received from all\n\nlevels of the FBI and the kind of conduct Connolly undertook on\n\nother occasions with seeming acquiescence from his superiors.             As\n\nsuch, it fell within the scope of his employment.\n\n                                    III.\n\n           The district court initially entered judgment in this\n\ncase without addressing post-judgment interest.             The plaintiffs\n\nsubsequently filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n59(e) seeking an amended judgment that included interest.                The\n\ncourt granted the motion on March 14, 2007, stating that post-\n\njudgment interest would run \"only from the date a party seeking\n\nrecovery of interest files the judgment with the Secretary of the\n\nTreasury until the judgment is paid.\"            The next day, the court\n\nentered   an   amended   judgment   that   did   not   include   the   timing\n\n\n\n\n                                    -43-\n\flanguage, but which provided for post-judgment interest to accrue\n\nat a rate of 5.05%.\n\n          The United States then filed its own Rule 59 motion,\n\narguing that, under 31 U.S.C. ยง 1304(b)(1), it may be liable for\n\npost-judgment   interest   \"only   from    the   date   of   filing   of   the\n\ntranscript of the judgment with the Secretary of the Treasury\n\nthrough the day before the date of the mandate of affirmance.\"             The\n\ncourt denied the government's motion, and the government asks on\n\nappeal that we explicitly hold that the statutory time period\n\napplies to the accrual of interest.\n\n          In a cross-appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the proper\n\npost-judgment interest rate is 5.10% rather than the 5.05% rate\n\nspecified by the district court.     The government concedes that the\n\nhigher rate is correct, and the plaintiffs do not dispute that the\n\nstatutory time period applies.            Consequently, on remand, the\n\ndistrict court should revise its order with respect to post-\n\njudgment interest accordingly.\n\n          The judgment of the district court in favor of plaintiffs\n\nis affirmed.    The case is remanded for entry of a corrected order\n\non post-judgment interest.    No costs are awarded.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -44-\n\f",

This case is another chapter in\n\nthe saga of the relationship between the FBI's Boston Office and\n\ntwo organized crime figures, James \"Whitey\" Bulger and Stephen\n\nFlemmi, whose unlawful, violent conduct in that city spanned three\n\ndecades.      Following an eighteen-day bench trial featuring nine\n\nwitnesses and thousands of pages of exhibits, the district court\n\nconcluded that former FBI agent John Connolly was acting within the\n\nscope    of   his     employment      when    he    leaked    the   identity    of   an\n\ninformant, John McIntyre, resulting in McIntyre's brutal murder by\n\nBulger, Flemmi and their associates in the notorious Winter Hill\n\nGang.         The     court    consequently         awarded     McIntyre's      estate\n\napproximately $3.1 million in damages against the government under\n\nthe Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. ยง 1346.\n\n              The government has appealed, arguing that Connolly was a\n\nrogue    agent      whose    disclosure      of    McIntyre's   identity      violated\n\nfundamental FBI policies and was beyond any rational view of\n\nconduct falling within the scope of his employment.

Connolly's Official Role with Bulger and Flemmi\n\n             Bulger and Flemmi were informants for the FBI's Boston\n\noffice at various times during a period of more than twenty-five\n\nyears.     Flemmi was first recruited in 1964 and Bulger in 1971, and\n\nboth men provided information off and on until 1990. McIntyre, 447\n\nF. Supp. 2d at 73.            They were considered particularly valuable\n\nsources for the office's high-priority investigation of the Boston\n\n\n                                         -4-\n\fbranch of La Cosa Nostra (\"LCN\").1      Although they were members of\n\nthe competing Winter Hill Gang, Bulger and Flemmi frequently\n\nconsorted with LCN members \"and purported to transmit inside\n\ninformation to the FBI concerning organized crime activities in New\n\nEngland.\" Connolly, 504 F.3d at 210. The Boston LCN investigation\n\nproved fruitful, leading to the 1983 arrests and 1986 convictions\n\nof the leading figures of the Boston branch, Gennaro Angiulo and\n\nIllario Zannino, as well as other LCN members.            McIntyre, 447 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 63.\n\n           Connolly, who joined the FBI in 1968, served as Bulger\n\nand   Flemmi's   \"handler\"   during   most   of   their    tenure   as   FBI\n\ninformants, beginning in 1975. Connolly, 341 F.3d at 20; McIntyre,\n\n447 F.

Flemmi stated that, in December 1976, Connolly told\n\nBulger that a bookmaker who did business with the Winter Hill gang,\n\nRichard Castucci, had been cooperating with the FBI.   Tr.

Indeed,\n\nHalloran had told Agent Brunnick and his partner, Agent Gerald\n\nMontanari, that Bulger, Flemmi and Callahan9 were responsible for\n\nplotting Wheeler's murder and that he, Halloran, had been paid\n\n$20,000 to keep quiet about it.

Although   some   details   of   Halloran's   story   were\n\ninvestigated, \"inexplicably, the Boston Office never followed up on\n\nHalloran's claim that Martorano, the reported shooter in the\n\nWheeler murder and a federal fugitive, was hiding out at Callahan's\n\ncondominium in Florida.\"     Id. at 85.\n\n            In the last week of May 1982, meetings to discuss the\n\nWheeler and Halloran killings took place in Washington and Boston.\n\nAt the Washington meeting, agents from Boston, Miami and Oklahoma\n\nCity, as well as officials from FBI Headquarters, acknowledged that\n\nBulger and Flemmi were suspects in the cases, but a decision was\n\nmade to retain them as \"open\" informants because the allegations\n\nagainst them were unsubstantiated and they were extremely valuable\n\nassets in the LCN investigation.     Id. at 87 (citing Ex. 30, May 25,\n\n1982 Memo from ASAC Fitzpatrick to Special Agent in Charge (\"SAC\")\n\nLawrence Sarhatt); Tr. Day 9, at 59-60 (Fitzpatrick testimony).10\n\nIf the suspicions had been confirmed, agency policy would have\n\n\n\n\n      10\n       Fitzpatrick testified that, despite his view that Bulger,\nat least, should be closed as an informant, \"everyone at\nheadquarters thought he should remain open\" because \"he was too\nvaluable.\"\n\n                                   -9-\n\fprevented their retention as informants without authorization from\n\nthe highest levels of the FBI and Justice Department.11\n\n            At a follow-up meeting two days later in Boston, Connolly\n\nโ who had not been at the meeting in Washington โ was informed that\n\nBulger and Flemmi were the focus of the investigation into the\n\nWheeler and Halloran murders.       He argued that they were not\n\ninvolved.   It was agreed that the agents investigating the murders\n\nwould not directly interview Bulger and Flemmi, and would rely\n\ninstead on Connolly acting as an intermediary.    447 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n87.\n\n            Two months later, Callahan also was dead.   Connolly had\n\ntold Bulger in July that the FBI was looking for Callahan to\n\nquestion him in connection with the Wheeler murder.     Tr. Day 2, at\n\n\n      11\n        The FBI's rules regarding the handling of informants,\ncontained in Section 137 of the agency's Manual of Investigative\nOperations and Guidelines (\"MIOG\"), required supervisors to make\nwritten findings on the \"suitability\" of an individual to serve as\nan informant. Ex. 6, ยง 137-17(1) (Attorney General's Guidelines on\nFBI Use of Informants and Confidential Sources, Part D(1)(1981)).\nAlthough the Guidelines allow use of informants who are involved in\ncriminal activity, the crimes must not be \"of a serious nature.\"\n447 F. Supp. 2d at 68 (citing Guidelines at Part G(2)). If a field\noffice learned that an informant had participated in a \"serious act\nof violence,\" it was required to notify FBI Headquarters and only\nthe Director or a \"senior Headquarters official\" could approve the\ncontinued use of such an informant โ after consultation with the\nAssistant Attorney General in charge of the Criminal Division. Id.\nat 69-70 (citing Guidelines at Part G(3)). Throughout their tenure\nas informants, Flemmi and Bulger were \"closed\" โ i.e., terminated\nas informants โ and re-opened multiple times.       Id. at 74 n.35\n(giving a chronology of Bulger's and Flemmi's openings and closings\nas informants between 1964 and 1990). At least with respect to\nFlemmi, a closing had little effect; he was treated as an informant\nregardless of his official status. Id. at 74.\n\n                                 -10-\n\f37 (Flemmi testimony).    According to Flemmi, Connolly also told\n\nBulger that \"Callahan was a weak link who would not be able to\n\nwithstand the pressure of an FBI interrogation.\"    447 F. Supp. 2d\n\nat 88.    Bulger and Flemmi concluded that Callahan needed to be\n\nkilled. Their usual hit man, Martorano, assisted by another Winter\n\nHill member, Joseph McDonald, killed Callahan at Fort Lauderdale\n\nInternational Airport on August 1, 1982.   Id. at 87 (citing Tr. Day\n\n2, at 40-41, Flemmi testimony).12\n\n           The FBI's recognition of the apparent link between the\n\nWinter Hill gang and three murders โ Wheeler's, Halloran's and\n\nCallahan's โ was reported in a November 1982 memo sent by the Chief\n\nof the FBI's Organized Crime Section, Sean McWeeney, to Associate\n\nDeputy Director Oliver Revell.      The memo stated that \"there is\n\nevidence [the murders] were committed by an organized crime group\n\nin Boston, Massachusetts, the Winter Hill gang.\" Id. at 88 (citing\n\nEx. 121, at 1).   James Greenleaf, who became the SAC of the Boston\n\nOffice on November 29, 1982, was among those copied on the memo,\n\nwhich was generated at FBI Headquarters in Washington.\n\n           By the time of that memo, Flemmi โ but not Bulger โ had\n\nbeen closed as an informant.        Officially, the reason for the\n\n\n\n     12\n       Martorano picked up Callahan at the airport and shot him in\nthe back of the head after he entered Martorano's car. Martorano\nand McDonald transferred the body to the trunk of Callahan's car,\nwhere it was discovered after a parking attendant noticed blood\ndripping from the vehicle. 447 F. Supp. 2d at 87 (citing Tr. Day\n2, at 40-41, Flemmi testimony).\n\n                                -11-\n\fclosing was his possible implication in criminal activity unrelated\n\nto the murders.    However, internal communications in the Boston\n\nOffice indicated that the murder investigation prompted his change\n\nin status.    447 F. Supp. 2d at 88 n.59.           Despite his closing,\n\nFlemmi continued to provide significant information to the FBI\n\nthroughout the period until he was re-opened in early July 1986.\n\nMeanwhile, Bulger remained open and, in February 1983, while the\n\nmurder investigations were ongoing, he was designated a \"Top\n\nEchelon\"   informant,   meaning   that   he   was   expected   to   provide\n\ninformation about management-level activity of an organized crime\n\ngroup. Id. at 66. Eventually, the murder investigation wound down\n\nwithout a contemporaneous resolution, despite the forty or so\n\nvolumes of files that had been produced on the crimes.         Tr. Day 13,\n\nat 96, 108 (Montanari testimony).13\n\nC.   FBI Knowledge of Connolly's Conduct\n\n           In its closing argument before the district court, the\n\ngovernment asserted that Bulger and Flemmi were not indicted in\n\nconnection with the murders and other criminal activity until 1995\n\nbecause they were \"very, very smart, and very, very cognizant of\n\n\n\n     13\n        Following an indictment in 1995, Flemmi pled guilty in 2003\nto racketeering acts that included the Castucci, Wheeler, Callahan\nand McIntyre murders. Another Winter Hill member, Kevin Weeks,\npled guilty to racketeering acts that included aiding and abetting\nthe Halloran, Donahue and McIntyre murders. 447 F. Supp. 2d at 59-\n60 nn.5 & 6. Bulger, who was charged with similar crimes, has been\na fugitive since the indictment was issued.

Day 18, at 121.\n\nHowever, considerable evidence supports the district court's view\n\nthat their awareness was not solely attributable to their own\n\nskills and acuity.       Other law enforcement representatives had\n\nexpressed concern about the Boston Office's \"too-close association\"\n\nwith members of Winter Hill.       447 F. Supp. 2d at 89.     In a meeting\n\nwith FBI Headquarters representatives in November 1982, Florida\n\nstate and local law enforcement members who were responsible for\n\ninvestigating the Callahan murder reported that they were reluctant\n\nto provide information to the Boston Office because they believed\n\nthe   Winter   Hill   connection   had    been   hindering   that   office's\n\ninvestigation into the murders.          Id.14   The concerns from Florida\n\nwere relayed in a memo from Organized Crime Chief McWeeney to\n\nAssociate Deputy Director Revell:\n\n           Inferences could be drawn from conversations\n           indicating   that   these  state   and   local\n           officials were of the opinion that the FBI had\n           confidential informants within the Winter Hill\n           organization and because of this their efforts\n           against this group were curtailed. In fact,\n           FBI Boston has previously utilized two\n           suspects in this matter as organized crime\n           sources in the Boston Division.\n\n\n      14\n        The Florida representatives also were troubled by the\nassociation between personnel in the FBI's Miami Office and a\nformer Boston Office agent, H. Paul Rico, who at the time of the\nmurders was working as head of security at World Jai Alai. 447 F.\nSupp. 2d at 89. In 1969, Rico had warned Flemmi that he was about\nto be indicted, enabling Flemmi to become a fugitive for five\nyears. Flemmi testified that he returned to Boston in 1974 after\nRico told him he would be protected from prosecution. Id. at 78-\n79; see Tr. Day 2, at 71-75 (Flemmi testimony).\n\n                                   -13-\n\fEx. 121, at 6; see also id. at 3 (noting the belief of law\n\nenforcement agencies in Miami that \"some Agents in the Boston FBI\n\nwould     not    pursue    allegations      against    the   Winter    Hill     gang\n\nvigorously\").\n\n                In addition to these hints that the Boston Office was\n\nprotecting Bulger and Flemmi from murder charges, the FBI had been\n\ntold explicitly by Halloran that someone in the office was leaking\n\ninformation to them.

Supp. 2d at\n\n95 n.71.\n\n                Despite the concerns from various sources that Connolly\n\nwas improperly disclosing information to Bulger and Flemmi, he\n\nconsistently received one of the FBI's top two ratings for his\n\noverall performance and his handling of informants throughout the\n\nperiod from 1978 to 1987.          Id. at 96.    On one occasion, Connolly's\n\nthen-supervisor, Agent James Ring, was chastised by an inspector\n\n\n     15\n        The DEA investigation did not produce results even though\nBulger and Flemmi were involved in drug trafficking from\napproximately 1981 to 1990. 447 F. Supp. 2d at 94 (citing Tr. Day\n2, at 62-63 (Flemmi testimony)). They eventually were indicted for\ntheir drug activity in 1995.\n\n                                        -14-\n\ffrom FBI Headquarters for rating Connolly \"superior\" rather than\n\n\"exceptional.\"       Id. at 97.      In a memo to the Special Agent in\n\nCharge of the Boston Office, Inspector Bob Reutter stated that he\n\nconsidered \"'the contributions made by SA [Special Agent] Connolly\n\nas    crucial   to   the   overall   OC   [Organized   Crime]   program   and\n\nsubstantial in terms of the results achieved.'\"           Id. (quoting Ex.\n\n55w, Memo of July 8, 1987).          Connolly was repeatedly recommended\n\nfor salary increases and monetary awards on the basis of his\n\nperformance,16 and he was asked by FBI Headquarters to instruct\n\nother federal agents on the development and handling of informants.\n\nId.    In 1988, he became the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task\n\nForce Coordinator in the Boston Office.          Id.\n\nD. McIntyre's FBI Involvement and Murder\n\n            McIntyre's relationship with the FBI's Boston Office\n\nbegan in the fall of 1984, shortly after the United States Customs\n\nService seized a ship, the Valhalla, on which he was serving as a\n\n\n       16\n       In a Performance Appraisal Report covering the period from\nNovember 15, 1981 through November 12, 1982 โ during which Halloran\nand Callahan were killed โ Connolly was praised for \"develop[ing],\nmaintain[ing], and operat[ing] a corps of extremely high level and\nproductive informants.\"    Ex. 55e.    The Report continued: \"His\ndirection and their resultant information has brought about results\nexceeded by none in the Boston Division's Organized Crime Program.\n. . . His performance has been at the level to which all should\naspire to attain but few will realistically reach.\" A memo from\nthe Boston Office to the Director of the FBI in August 1981 stated\nthat Connolly \"currently operates . . . high-placed informants\nfurnishing information on Organized Crime in the New England area\nand has significantly contributed toward the achievement of the OC\nSquad goals and objectives especially through his skillful\ndirection of high-quality informants.\" Ex. 55h.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fcrew member. The Valhalla had just returned from Ireland, where it\n\nhad delivered an illegal cargo of weapons and ammunition for the\n\nIrish Republican Army (\"IRA\").         McIntyre, one of two crew members\n\non board, had already been cooperating with agents of the Drug\n\nEnforcement Agency (\"DEA\"),17 and the next day, October 17, 1984,\n\nhe met with a Customs agent, Philip Brady, and two FBI officers,\n\nRoderick Kennedy and George Bertram.            Brady and Kennedy were\n\nmembers of the Drug Task Force, which consisted of representatives\n\nfrom Customs, the IRS and the FBI.           Bertram was present at the\n\nmeeting because he covered the IRA for the FBI.        447 F. Supp. 2d at\n\n99.\n\n               During the meeting, McIntyre discussed an upcoming drug\n\nshipment that was expected by Murray, whom customs already knew\n\npaid \"tribute\" โ a fee โ to Bulger so that he could safely operate\n\nhis drug smuggling operation in South Boston.18            Id.     McIntyre\n\nconfirmed       the   Murray-Bulger   connection,   reporting    that   \"'an\n\nindividual named Whitey [a Bulger nickname] who operates a liquor\n\nstore in South Boston became partners with Joe Murray.'\"            Id. at\n\n100.        McIntyre was released after he agreed to cooperate with\n\nCustoms and the FBI in the ongoing investigation into Murray's drug\n\n\n\n       17\n        McIntyre was working at the time for Joe Murray, another\nBoston crime figure who was involved in drug and weapons smuggling.\n       18\n       Bulger and Flemmi collected \"rent\" or tribute from other\ncriminals as payment for the privilege of conducting activity\nwithin territory controlled by them.

On the basis of information he provided, the combined\n\nlaw enforcement agencies seized Murray's next drug load on a ship,\n\nthe Ramsland, as it entered Boston Harbor in mid-November 1984.\n\nMcIntyre was on board as a member of the \"substitute crew\" that had\n\nreplaced the ship's English crew at the mouth of the harbor.     The\n\nship was carrying thirty tons of marijuana, and Flemmi testified\n\nthat he expected to receive $1 million from the shipment's sales\n\nproceeds.   Kevin Weeks, another Winter Hill member, testified that\n\nhe, Bulger and Flemmi each were to receive $3 million.\n\n            After the Ramsland was seized, McIntyre reported to Brady\n\nthat Murray suspected someone in the substitute crew of cooperating\n\nwith law enforcement.    McIntyre did not feel that he was in danger,\n\nand Brady also assumed McIntyre was not at risk because there had\n\nbeen no apparent change in his relationship with Murray.      Id. at\n\n101.   On November 22, a few days after the Ramsland's seizure,\n\nMcIntyre reported to Brady that Pat Nee, a Bulger associate, had\n\noffered him the opportunity to invest $20,000 in a drug smuggling\n\nventure.

It emphasizes that the leak of an informant's identity\n\nis   contrary    to    explicit    FBI    policy,31    it    violated     Connolly's\n\nEmployment Agreement with the FBI,32 and such a disclosure would\n\njeopardize the agency's continuing ability to recruit informants โ\n\nwho are a crucial tool in the FBI's investigatory efforts.                        The\n\ngovernment additionally characterizes Connolly's leak of McIntyre's\n\nidentity as a form of theft or embezzlement that he committed in\n\nexchange for the money and other gifts provided by Bulger and\n\n\n       30\n        Prong two โ requiring that the conduct occur \"within\nauthorized time and space limits\" โ warrants little discussion.\nThere is no dispute that Connolly was the handler for Bulger and\nFlemmi when he disclosed McIntyre's identity, and his job was not\nconfined to specific hours or locations. Consequently, prong two\nis easily satisfied.\n       31\n       The FBI's Manual of Investigative Operations and Guidelines\ncautioned that agents must take care in handling informants \"to\ninsure that they are not provided any information other than that\nnecessary to carry out their assignments.\" See Ex. 6, Guidelines,\nยง 137-3(8) (1978).\n       32\n        The agreement that Connolly signed acknowledges his\nunderstanding that \"unauthorized disclosure of information in the\nfiles of the FBI or information I may acquire as an employee of the\nFBI could . . . prevent the FBI from effectively discharging its\nresponsibilities,\" and he agreed never to \"divulge, publish, or\nreveal either by word or conduct . . . to any unauthorized\nrecipient without official written authorization by the Director of\nthe FBI or his delegate, any information from the investigatory\nfiles of the FBI . . . or disclose any information . . . acquired\nas a part of the performance of my official duties.\"\n\n                                         -28-\n\fFlemmi, and it argues that taking bribes to steal from an employer\n\ncan never constitute conduct within the scope of employment.\n\n          As to motivation, the government highlights Connolly's\n\nconviction for collaborating with Bulger and Flemmi, and argues\n\nthat the McIntyre leak was motivated solely by his desire to\n\nfurther their joint criminal enterprise and to protect them from\n\nprosecution.   The government argues that there is no evidence that\n\nConnolly's   revelation   of    McIntyre's     identity     was   in   any   way\n\nintended to further the interests of the FBI; rather, it was in\n\nkeeping with other acts of betrayal that he committed to advance\n\nhis personal interests at the expense of the FBI and its mission.\n\n          Connolly's role as Bulger's and Flemmi's handler cannot,\n\nthe government insists, place all of his interactions with them\n\nwithin the scope of his employment.          Protecting them at any cost โ\n\nand facilitating McIntyre's murder โ was not the sort of conduct he\n\nwas hired to perform.          The government's view is perhaps best\n\nsummarized by its statement at oral argument that, by the time of\n\nthe McIntyre leak, \"this guy [had] crossed to the other side; he\n\nwas a criminal who had a day job as an FBI agent.\"\n\n          We understand the government's perspective.                  Connolly\n\ntook advantage of his law enforcement status to form a corrupt\n\nrelationship   with   Bulger    and    Flemmi.     As   a   general     matter,\n\ndisclosing an informant's identity to violent criminals who have a\n\npenchant for murdering people whom they consider a threat seems far\n\n\n                                      -29-\n\foutside the range of conduct Connolly was employed to perform. The\n\nMcIntyre leak violated a bright-line law enforcement rule that\n\ninformant identity never be revealed, and put at risk the life of\n\nan individual who was helping the FBI.        There is some appeal in the\n\ngovernment's position that such conduct is categorically outside\n\nthe scope of an FBI agent's employment and that, consequently, it\n\ncould   only   be   motivated   by   Connolly's   desire   to   advance   his\n\nlucrative, unlawful second \"career.\"\n\n           The government's depiction of the case, however, fails to\n\nacknowledge its extraordinary context.            The factors it lists in\n\narguing that Connolly's disclosure of McIntyre's identity fell\n\noutside the scope of his employment โ including the contractual and\n\npolicy prohibitions on leaks, the \"'seriously criminal'\" nature of\n\nhis action, and its \"extreme 'departure from the normal method of\n\n[handling informants],'\" Reply Brief at 8 (quoting Restatement\n\n(Second) of Agency, ยง 229(2)(j),(i)) โ paint Connolly as a lone\n\nrenegade whose outrageous, unprecedented behavior could not have\n\nbeen anticipated by his superiors.          This assessment of Connolly's\n\nconduct is unduly narrow.\n\n           Although it is undisputed that Connolly had no explicit\n\nauthority to disclose McIntyre's identity, we must look to his\n\n\"actual and customary\" duties to determine if the leak may be\n\nconsidered within the scope of his employment.         Howard, 506 N.E.2d\n\nat 105-106; see also Potter, 463 F.3d at 26;.         As we shall explain,\n\n\n                                     -30-\n\fwe agree with the district court that Connolly's disclosure was\n\nwithin the boundaries of the FBI's longstanding method of handling\n\nBulger and Flemmi through Connolly, and that it consequently is\n\n\"'just'\" to treat the harm caused by the disclosure \"'as one of the\n\nnormal risks to be borne by the business in which the servant is\n\nemployed,'\" Croes v.

Prong One: Kind of Employment\n\n            The FBI as an institution had selected La Cosa Nostra as\n\nits highest priority, and it correctly viewed Bulger and Flemmi as\n\nuniquely effective tools in dismantling Winter Hill's organized\n\ncrime competitor.         As a result, the two men received kid-glove\n\ntreatment from all levels of the FBI for decades.                 The district\n\ncourt recounts in great detail that suspicions about Bulger's and\n\nFlemmi's    involvement     in   serious    crimes    were   repeatedly    left\n\nunexplored   or    were    pursued   minimally,      and   the   FBI   routinely\n\ndeparted from the agency's regulations when working with them โ\n\npresumably to assure that they would remain available to provide\n\ncritical LCN intelligence.\n\n            Examples of this deferential handling of Bulger and\n\nFlemmi abound in the record.            They include judgments made by\n\nHeadquarters personnel as well as by supervisors in the Boston\n\nOffice.    Among them are the following, some of which we previously\n\nhave described in more detail:\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\f           (1) Bulger and Flemmi were removed from a 1979 indictment\n\ncharging a scheme to fix horse races, and listed only as unindicted\n\nco-conspirators,     after    a   request     by   Connolly      and    his   then-\n\nsupervisor,   John   Morris,      because     of   their    value      to   the   LCN\n\ninvestigation.   447 F. Supp. 2d at 80;33\n\n           (2) At the Washington and Boston meetings in May 1982,\n\nhigh level FBI officials decided to retain Bulger and Flemmi as\n\nopen informants despite suspicions about their roles in the Wheeler\n\nand Halloran murders.        Id. at 87;\n\n           (3) In response to a 1983 request from the Oklahoma City\n\nOffice of the FBI that Bulger and Flemmi's informant files be\n\nexamined for reports of activity around the time of the Wheeler and\n\nCallahan murders, Connolly wrote a report โ two years after the\n\nWheeler murder and a year after Callahan's โ establishing alibis\n\nfor Bulger for both dates.             Connolly's supervisors apparently\n\naccepted   the   report      without    questioning        its   delay,     despite\n\nConnolly's conspicuous violation of FBI guidelines requiring a much\n\nprompter report under the circumstances.             Id. at 90-91;34\n\n\n     33\n       At the time, neither Bulger nor Flemmi was officially open\nas an informant. 447 F. Supp. 2d at 80.\n     34\n       The district court found that Connolly discussed the alibi\nfor the Wheeler death with Bulger shortly after the murder, telling\nBulger that if he were implicated in the killing, Connolly would\nsay that he and Bulger had spoken by telephone the night of the\nmurder and that Bulger was in Boston, not in Oklahoma City, at that\ntime. The memo Connolly prepared two years later provided just\nsuch an alibi. 447 F. Supp. 2d at 82 (citing Ex. 111, Memo from\nConnolly to SAC).    The Manual of Investigative Operations and\n\n                                       -32-\n\f           (4) When Bulger and Flemmi eventually were interviewed\n\nabout the murders following an inquiry from the Tulsa Police\n\nDepartment,      they   were    interviewed    together    at    the    pair's\n\ninsistence, contrary to standard procedures.            Id. at 91;\n\n           (5) The Boston Office files contained many references to\n\nBulger's   and    Flemmi's     involvement    between   1965    and    1987   in\n\nloansharking and bookmaking, crimes that should have triggered\n\ninvestigations into their suitability to remain informants. Id. at\n\n76-78 & n.41.      Even during periods when Flemmi was closed as an\n\ninformant, he was treated as an informant, and during one closed\n\nstretch in 1983, an agent who wanted to interview him approached\n\nhim through Connolly. Id. at 74 (citing Tr. Day 13, at 105-107,\n\nMontanari testimony);35\n\n           (6) James Greenleaf, the SAC of the Boston Office from\n\nNovember 1982 through October 1986, testified that investigations\n\nof Bulger and Flemmi by other law enforcement agencies \"just didn't\n\nregister\" with him. This lack of attention to the growing evidence\n\n\n\nGuidelines requires that contacts with informants be recorded in\nthe informant's file at or near the time they occurred. Ex. 6,\nGuidelines ยง 137-8(1) (1981) (\"All information pertinent to our\ninvestigative responsibilities furnished by informants must be\npromptly reviewed, recorded, indexed, evaluated, channelized, and\nall other necessary action taken.\").\n     35\n       The continuity of the relationship violated FBI guidelines.\nThe MIOG requires that, when an informant is closed because he is\n\"no longer suitable to provide information or operational\nassistance, his relationship with the Bureau shall be promptly\nterminated.\" Ex. 6, ยง 137-17, Guidelines Part D(7).\n\n                                    -33-\n\fof the pair's involvement in serious criminal activity allowed him\n\nto avoid meaningful suitability reviews of their status.     See Tr.\n\nDay 14, at 104.36\n\n           Although the United States asserts that Bulger and Flemmi\n\nescaped prosecution and retained their informant status, sometimes\n\nunofficially, because none of the FBI's suspicions were validated\n\nby concrete evidence, the record supports the district court's\n\nobservation that \"the FBI was not pounding the pavement looking for\n\nevidence that could 'stick.'    Instead, the FBI stuck its head in\n\nthe sand when it came to the criminal activities of Bulger and\n\nFlemmi.\"   447 F. Supp. 2d at 93.37    Indeed, the deference paid to\n\nBulger and Flemmi did not go unnoticed by the two men.        Flemmi\n\n\n     36\n        Greenleaf testified that a suitability review should be\nconducted in response to reports of serious criminal activity, but\nno suitability review was conducted for Bulger and Flemmi during\nhis tenure as SAC of the Boston Office. Tr. Day 14, at 53-54. He\nstated that he had received no report that they were involved in\nsuch activity. Id.\n     37\n       Soon after Fitzpatrick arrived in the Boston Office in 1981,\nhe met with Bulger and subsequently recommended to Lawrence\nSarhatt, the SAC of the Boston Office from 1980 until November\n1982, that he be closed as an informant.       Fitzpatrick thought\nSarhatt agreed with him:\n\n     I felt . . . that he went along with it. But whatever\n     happened thereafter, there were other intervening cases,\n     LCN, and so forth that intruded, and we went on with\n     other stuff.\n\nTr. Day 8, at 17.      However, when Fitzpatrick made the same\nrecommendation to McWeeney, the FBI's Organized Crime Chief,\nMcWeeney \"started telling me how valuable Mr. Bulger was.\" Id. at\n21. Fitzpatrick understood that it was a Headquarters decision to\nkeep Bulger open. Id. at 25.\n\n                                -34-\n\ftestified that the agents in the Boston Office treated him and\n\nBulger like colleagues, \"'like we were FBI agents.'\"              Id. at 91\n\nn.65 (quoting Tr. June 6, 2006, at 93-94).\n\n          Moreover, Connolly's disclosure of McIntyre's identity\n\nwas neither his first nor only leak of sensitive information, and\n\nthe FBI repeatedly was told of concerns that Connolly was a source\n\nof leaked information.     In December 1976, Connolly learned that\n\nCastucci had provided information to the FBI about the whereabouts\n\nof two Winter Hill members.    He told Bulger, who promptly arranged\n\nCastucci's    murder.   Id.   at   79.    The   Boston   Office    received\n\ninformation from more than one source that Bulger and Flemmi had\n\nkilled Castucci, id., but apparently never asked Connolly if he\n\nknew anything about the circumstances of the murder, id. at 80\n\nn.44.\n\n          We previously have described the concerns expressed by\n\nlocal law enforcement authorities in Massachusetts and Florida\n\nconcerning leaks from the Boston Office and from Connolly in\n\nparticular.    Although this knowledge of local concerns went to the\n\nhighest levels of the FBI, the record shows no meaningful follow-\n\nup, even after Halloran's explicit report that someone in the\n\nBoston Office was leaking information to Bulger and Flemmi. Id. at\n\n83 & n.49;38 see also id. at 95 n.71 (noting the concerns \"as early\n\n\n     38\n       At trial, Agent Montanari testified that, despite Halloran's\nreport about a leak in the Boston Office during the time he was\ninvestigating the murders, he did not believe anyone in the office\n\n                                   -35-\n\fas 1982 that Bulger and Flemmi might be obtaining information\n\nconcerning investigations of their criminal activities from the\n\nBoston     Office   itself\");    Tr.    Day     9,   at    39-40        (Fitzpatrick\n\ntestimony).       Fitzpatrick testified that he was informed by SAC\n\nSarhatt upon Fitzpatrick's arrival in Boston in 1981 that Connolly\n\nand his supervisor, Morris, might have leaked information to Bulger\n\nand   Flemmi   that    compromised      an    investigation        by    state   law\n\nenforcement authorities.        Tr. Day 7, at 61.         Fitzpatrick also had\n\nbeen told by FBI Assistant Director McKinnon, who was based at FBI\n\nHeadquarters, that there were problems in the Boston Office. Asked\n\nat trial if he investigated whether Connolly was \"the pipeline\" for\n\nBulger and Flemmi, Fitzpatrick responded that \"[i]t wasn't part of\n\nthe purview at that time.        That was not part of the investigation\n\nat that time.\"      Tr. Day 9, at 40.\n\n            Greenleaf, the SAC beginning in November 1982, testified\n\nthat he was not focused on the reports that Bulger and Flemmi had\n\nsources    within   law   enforcement        generally    or   within      the   FBI,\n\nalthough he was concerned that they were receiving information\n\nabout investigations into their activities.               Tr. Day 14, at 119.\n\nHe knew of no investigation being conducted in response to those\n\nreports.    Id.\n\n\n\n\nwas improperly disclosing information. Tr. Day 13, at 110. He\nsaid he did not give \"any credence\" to rumors from other police\nagencies expressing distrust of Connolly. Id.\n\n                                       -36-\n\f            Instead,    as    the    other    law   enforcement       departments\n\nexpressed their concerns about Connolly's relationship with Bulger\n\nand Flemmi, Connolly was being highly praised by his superiors for\n\nhis handling of informants.          As described supra, he consistently\n\nwas given the highest possible ratings for his overall performance\n\nand his work with informants, even after questions arose about\n\nwhether he might be Bulger's and Flemmi's \"pipeline.\"\n\n            We recognize that not every agent in the FBI's Boston\n\nOffice condoned Connolly's tactics or ignored every allegation of\n\nserious criminal behavior by Bulger and Flemmi.              To the contrary,\n\nSAC Sarhatt looked into allegations of leaks related to a wiretap\n\nin the late 1970s and, in a personal interview of Bulger, asked if\n\nhe had received any information from a member of the FBI.                 Bulger\n\nresponded negatively.         Id. at 83 n.49.       Fitzpatrick, who was in\n\ncharge of the C-3 Squad through the mid-1980s, testified that he\n\nlocked up investigative files on the Wheeler murder after Agents\n\nMontanari and Brunnick expressed concerns that Connolly had been\n\nrifling through the material and passing information along to\n\nBulger.     Tr. Day 7, at 21-24.39           Brunnick and Montanari amassed\n\nsubstantial files on the Wheeler-Halloran-Donahue-Callahan murders\n\nin   what   appears    to    have   been,    on   their   part,   a   good-faith\n\ninvestigation that was frustrated by the Boston Office's collegial\n\n\n      39\n       Montanari testified that he never told Fitzpatrick about\nConnolly rifling through his files and did not remember Brunnick\nexpressing such a concern.

Day 16, at 76, 80 (Ring testimony).                      But such\n\ndiscrete expressions of concern about Connolly's interactions with\n\nthe   pair   and    their   possible    involvement    in   serious     criminal\n\nactivity do not dispel the dominant impression created by the\n\nrecord     that    the   FBI,   both   within   the   Boston   Office    and   at\n\nHeadquarters in Washington, engaged for years in a strategy that\n\ngave Connolly wide berth in his interactions with Bulger and\n\nFlemmi.\n\n             The United States argues that, even conceding that the\n\nFBI took some steps to preserve the flow of information from Bulger\n\nand Flemmi, Connolly's disclosure of McIntyre's identity โ leading\n\nforeseeably to his death โ was \"dramatically different from all of\n\nthe other acts cited by the plaintiffs\" and directly contrary to\n\nthe FBI's interests.        That assertion does not fairly reflect the\n\nrecord.      As we have described, Connolly had revealed sensitive\n\ninformation in the past, including the identity of informants. FBI\n\nHeadquarters knew that other law enforcement agencies suspected\n\nConnolly of being the leak in the Boston Office, but it made no\n\n\n\n      40\n       The district court commented that \"the investigation is more\nnotable for what was not done than for what was done,\" including\nthe absence of \"serious interrogation of the prime suspects, Bulger\nand Flemmi.\" Id. at 93.\n\n                                       -38-\n\feffort to seriously investigate the allegations or to terminate\n\nConnolly's relationship with Bulger and Flemmi.    Unquestionably,\n\nthe disclosure at issue in this case was officially unauthorized\n\nand forbidden.   However, it was not outside Connolly's customary\n\nrange of activity.   Even if we accept that the FBI's failure to\n\nseriously investigate the allegations against Connolly, and to\n\ninstead praise his abilities, does not constitute tacit approval of\n\nhis methods, the agency's attitude at least reflects a judgment\n\nthat Connolly's at-the-edge conduct could be tolerated for the\n\ngreater good of bringing down La Cosa Nostra. McIntyre's death was\n\none of the consequences of that attitude.\n\n          The United States argues that deeming Connolly's leak to\n\nbe within the scope of his employment leads inevitably to the\n\nconclusion that Connolly also would have been acting within the\n\nscope of his employment if he had shot McIntyre himself.      That\n\ndramatic argument ignores the claim actually before us. Nothing in\n\nthis record suggests that Connolly committed acts of violence\n\nhimself that were condoned by the FBI.   By contrast, the leak of\n\nMcIntyre's identity fell within the range of activity that had\n\nbecome customary for Connolly without reprisal from his superiors\n\n-- despite their awareness that he may be engaging in such conduct.\n\nAt some point, unauthorized conduct will cross the line between\n\nacts that fall within the employee's scope of employment and those\n\nthat are so far removed from the employer's methods and purposes\n\n\n                               -39-\n\fthat they fall outside it.             The question here was where on the\n\nspectrum to place Connolly's leak of McIntyre's identity.                  For the\n\nreasons we have discussed, we hold that the scope of Connolly's\n\nemployment was broad enough to encompass this kind of conduct.\n\n                2.    Prong Three: Motivation\n\n                The   district   court    did    not   commit   clear     error   in\n\nconcluding that Connolly's favors to Bulger and Flemmi โ including\n\nhis unauthorized disclosure of confidential information โ were\n\nmotivated at least in part by a desire to advance the FBI's agenda.\n\nSee 447 F. Supp. 2d at 111.41            Through his connection with Bulger\n\nand Flemmi, Connolly was able to simultaneously help the FBI\n\nsucceed in its efforts against LCN and help Bulger and Flemmi in\n\ntheir        quest    to   control   organized    crime   in    Boston,    thereby\n\nsolidifying his status in both realms.                 Connolly received both\n\nsalary increases and monetary awards from the FBI on the basis of\n\nhis performance, which, as we have explained, was highly praised\n\n\n\n\n        41\n        After noting that he credited Flemmi's testimony that\nConnolly received more than $200,000 in cash and gifts from Bulger\nand Flemmi, the district court explicitly found that \"Connolly was\nmotivated in part by greed and his friendship with Flemmi and\nespecially Bulger.\"    447 F. Supp. 2d at 111.     The court then\nrejected the notion that Connolly's motivations were \"purely\npersonal.\"   Id. (emphasis omitted).    Relying on its extensive\nreview of the decades-long history of Connolly's relationship with\nthe two men, the court stated: \"For reasons already discussed, I\nfind that Connolly was motivated, at least in part, by a desire to\npromote the FBI's goal of taking down Cosa Nostra through the use\nof Bulger and Flemmi as informants.\" Id.\n\n                                         -40-\n\fbecause of his success in working with Bulger and Flemmi.                        Id. at\n\n97.\n\n            The government points out that the record contains no\n\ndirect evidence that Connolly intended to benefit the FBI by\n\nrevealing McIntyre's identity, and it emphasizes that every law\n\nenforcement officer who testified stated that leaking informant\n\nidentity is always harmful to investigating agencies. However, the\n\ndistrict court did not have to find that identifying McIntyre was\n\nitself in the FBI's interest. Providing Bulger and Flemmi with any\n\nconfidential     information      of     use    to    them    would   reinforce     the\n\nrelationship between Connolly and his informants and invite their\n\ncontinued reciprocity with information about LCN.                      Thus, even if\n\nConnolly understood that revealing an informant's identity might in\n\nthe   abstract   harm     the    FBI's    future      ability    to   recruit     other\n\ninformants, that does not diminish the immediate benefit Connolly\n\nwould    perceive   for    the    FBI    from    his    efforts       to   get   useful\n\ninformation about LCN from these individuals.                   Such a cost-benefit\n\nanalysis seems particularly rational in the context of the FBI's\n\nnational priority to eliminate LCN.                  See id. at 62 (citing April\n\n23, 1980 memo from FBI Director to Attorney General).\n\n            Hence, the facts of this case are unlike those in the\n\ncases cited by the government as examples of employee conduct that\n\nis not fairly attributed to the employer.                    The circumstances here\n\nare     easily   distinguishable,          for       example,     from      a    simple\n\n\n                                         -41-\n\fembezzlement, see In re American Biomaterials Corp., </pre><span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"576648\"><a href=\"/opinion/576648/in-the-matter-of-american-biomaterials-corporation-a-virginia-corporation/\"><span class=\"volume\">954</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">919</span></a></span><pre class=\"inline\">,\n\n924-25 (3d Cir. 1992), from a day care center employee's sexual\n\nassault of children, Worcester Ins.

In none of these cases is there a\n\nplausible   theory   that   the   employee's   action    could   have   been\n\nmotivated in part by the employer's interests.          See 447 F. Supp.2d\n\nat 111 n.96 (distinguishing Atallah and similar cases because\n\n\"there is no obvious way in which the employees' motivations would\n\noverlap\" with those of the employers).         Nor does the $200,000 in\n\nmoney and gifts that Connolly received from Bulger and Flemmi\n\nrequire a finding that the McIntyre leak was solely a personal\n\nendeavor.    The record does not suggest that Connolly received\n\npayments for particular tips, but rather that he received periodic\n\nrewards as part of the ongoing relationship that the FBI expected\n\nhim to nurture.42    The district court therefore permissibly found\n\nthat the McIntyre disclosure was partially motivated by Connolly's\n\ndesire to maintain his relationship with Bulger and Flemmi in order\n\nto further the FBI's effort to dismantle La Cosa Nostra.\n\n\n\n\n     42\n       Flemmi testified that he exchanged money and gifts with\nmultiple members of the C-3 Squad to maintain \"goodwill and\nprotection.\" Tr. Day 2, at 93-104.\n\n                                   -42-\n\f           3. Conclusion on Scope of Employment\n\n           In agreeing with the district court that the FBI is\n\nresponsible for McIntyre's death as the foreseeable consequence of\n\nConnolly's leak, we do not suggest that such an outcome was desired\n\nor even contemplated by Connolly's superiors.           Moreover, contrary\n\nto the government's suggestion, this outcome is not a judgment\n\nthat the government's interests were in fact advanced by McIntyre's\n\nmurder.   Our conclusion, like the district court's, is only that\n\ndisclosure of McIntyre's identity was in keeping with both the\n\ndeferential treatment Bulger and Flemmi regularly received from all\n\nlevels of the FBI and the kind of conduct Connolly undertook on\n\nother occasions with seeming acquiescence from his superiors.             As\n\nsuch, it fell within the scope of his employment.\n\n                                    III.\n\n           The district court initially entered judgment in this\n\ncase without addressing post-judgment interest.             The plaintiffs\n\nsubsequently filed a motion under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure\n\n59(e) seeking an amended judgment that included interest.                The\n\ncourt granted the motion on March 14, 2007, stating that post-\n\njudgment interest would run \"only from the date a party seeking\n\nrecovery of interest files the judgment with the Secretary of the\n\nTreasury until the judgment is paid.\"            The next day, the court\n\nentered   an   amended   judgment   that   did   not   include   the   timing\n\n\n\n\n                                    -43-\n\flanguage, but which provided for post-judgment interest to accrue\n\nat a rate of 5.05%.\n\n          The United States then filed its own Rule 59 motion,\n\narguing that, under 31 U.S.C. ยง 1304(b)(1), it may be liable for\n\npost-judgment   interest   \"only   from    the   date   of   filing   of   the\n\ntranscript of the judgment with the Secretary of the Treasury\n\nthrough the day before the date of the mandate of affirmance.\"             The\n\ncourt denied the government's motion, and the government asks on\n\nappeal that we explicitly hold that the statutory time period\n\napplies to the accrual of interest.\n\n          In a cross-appeal, the plaintiffs contend that the proper\n\npost-judgment interest rate is 5.10% rather than the 5.05% rate\n\nspecified by the district court.     The government concedes that the\n\nhigher rate is correct, and the plaintiffs do not dispute that the\n\nstatutory time period applies.            Consequently, on remand, the\n\ndistrict court should revise its order with respect to post-\n\njudgment interest accordingly.\n\n          The judgment of the district court in favor of plaintiffs\n\nis affirmed.    The case is remanded for entry of a corrected order\n\non post-judgment interest.    No costs are awarded.\n\n          So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -44-\n\f</pre>",
