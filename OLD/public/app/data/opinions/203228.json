Camille L. Vélez-Rivé, U.S. Magistrate Judge]\n\n\n                                Before\n\n                 Torruella and Lynch, Circuit Judges,\n                   Keenan, Senior District Judge.*\n\n\n\n          Luis Vivaldi Oliver for appellant.\n          Roberto Feliberti with whom Arturo Díaz-Angueira and\nCancio, Nadal, Rivera & Díaz, P.S.C. were on brief for appellees.\n\n\n                            April 4, 2008\n\n\n\n\n     *\n          Of   the   Southern   District   of   New   York,   sitting   by\ndesignation.\n\f           LYNCH, Circuit Judge.              Roberto Lugo-Velázquez was an\n\nemployee of Stiefel Laboratories Puerto Rico, Inc. until his\n\nemployment was terminated when that company substantially reduced\n\nits operations to one person in Puerto Rico in January 2003.                   While\n\nemployed, Lugo was a participant in an employee stock bonus plan of\n\nthe   parent    company,   Stiefel     Laboratories,     Inc.      He    was   not,\n\nhowever,   a    participant      in   the   Stiefel    Laboratories      §    401(k)\n\nretirement plan; Puerto Rican residents, like Lugo, did not qualify\n\nto be participants because of federal tax rules.\n\n           After his employment was terminated, Lugo brought a\n\nnumber of claims in federal court in Puerto Rico against Stiefel\n\nLaboratories and Stiefel Laboratories Puerto Rico.                By order dated\n\nFebruary   8,    2005,     the   district      court   assigned    all       further\n\nproceedings in the case to a magistrate judge.               Summary judgment\n\nwas entered against Lugo on all claims in two successive rounds of\n\nsummary judgment motions. The motions resulted in two opinions and\n\norders, dated July 31, 2006, and May 30, 2007.                  The nature and\n\ndisposition of most of the claims need not be described for\n\npurposes of this appeal.\n\n           The present appeal is from the dismissal of all of Lugo's\n\nERISA claims in the second summary judgment order.                      His appeal\n\nappears to present three major ERISA-related arguments: (1) under\n\nERISA § 502(a)(1)(B), 29 U.S.C. § 1132(a)(1)(B), Lugo claims that\n\nhe was denied disability benefits to which he was entitled; (2)\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\funder ERISA § 502(a)(1)(A), (a)(3), and (c), 29 U.S.C. § 1132\n\n(a)(1)(A), (a)(3), and (c), he claims that he was denied access to\n\ndocuments and descriptions relating to the disability plan and the\n\nemployee   stock   bonus   plan;    and    (3)   he   claims    that   Stiefel's\n\nimproper   plan    administration    and     failure    to     provide   certain\n\nbenefits to him as a resident of Puerto Rico amounted to national\n\norigin discrimination in violation of Title VII.                   None of the\n\narguments have merit.1\n\n           The first two claims are largely related.             Lugo's brief,\n\nwith commendable candor, admits that there is no evidence in the\n\nrecord that he met the eligibility requirements or applied for\n\ndisability benefits.       He nonetheless attempts to survive summary\n\njudgment by arguing he should be excused from producing evidence of\n\napplication, eligibility, and denial because he claims he never\n\nreceived plan documents.           As he puts it: \"Plaintiff has not\n\npresented enough evidence to sustain it[s] disability claim because\n\ndefendants . . . ha[ve] not provided it . . . .\"\n\n           Even on its own terms, this house-of-cards type of\n\nargument fails.      Lugo admits in his brief that he was given an\n\n\n\n     1\n          Lugo also briefly makes the argument that his employment\nwas terminated in retaliation for his \"opposition to the improper\nadministration and management of his benefits,\" in violation of\nERISA § 510, 29 U.S.C. § 1140. As the magistrate judge pointed\nout, this argument is foreclosed by the court's determination in\nthe first summary judgment motion that his employment was\nterminated because Stiefel substantially reduced its Puerto Rican\noperations.\n\n                                     -3-\n\f\"informative\" brochure by the company containing plan provisions,\n\nwhich contained sufficiently specific information to allow him to\n\ncalculate the amount of benefits to which he claims he is entitled.\n\nIn response to Stiefel's argument that he was not entitled to\n\ndisability       benefits   because    he     did      not   apply     for    short-term\n\ndisability       benefits   under     SINOT      (a    Puerto    Rican       government-\n\nsponsored    insurance      program),       as    the    company       required,      Lugo\n\nacknowledges that this requirement existed but argues that he would\n\nnot have been eligible for SINOT coverage.                   But whether Lugo would\n\nhave qualified is beside the point.               Stiefel required him to apply\n\nto SINOT because its short-term disability program was managed by\n\nSINOT,     and    qualifying    under       the       short-term     program     was    a\n\nprerequisite      to   qualifying     for     Stiefel's       long-term       disability\n\nprogram.     Moreover, as the magistrate judge noted, Lugo did not\n\nrequest plan-related documents during discovery, nor did he file an\n\naffidavit under Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(f) that summary judgment should\n\nnot enter because such documents had not been produced.2\n\n            Lugo further argues that the magistrate judge did not\n\nconsider    his    disability   benefits          claim.        That    is    true,    but\n\nexplained by the fact that the magistrate judge did not think that\n\n\n     2\n          Similarly, to the extent that Lugo's claim that Stiefel\ndid not furnish documents relates to the employee stock benefit\nplan in which he was participating, he relies on bald assertions\nthat information was withheld and has provided no evidence to\nsupport his claim, including any evidence that he actually\nrequested the information.\n\n\n                                        -4-\n\fLugo was making a claim for disability benefits.   Even reading ¶ 22\n\nof his complaint as making such a claim, and putting aside the\n\nobscurity of the claim (if, indeed, the claim was not abandoned) at\n\nthe summary judgment stage, it is still true that there is no\n\nevidence in the record supporting either his disability benefits\n\nclaim3 or his document request claim.     Summary judgment can be\n\naffirmed on any ground fairly demonstrated by the record.    T-Peg,\n\nInc. v. Vt. Timber Works, Inc., 459 F.3d 97, 111 (1st Cir. 2006).\n\n          Lugo's final argument with respect to these two claims is\n\nthat the defendants had waived any defense to these claims, and he\n\nfiled nothing because he understood that the court had so held in\n\nits July 31, 2006 order.   The court held no such thing.   It merely\n\nnoted that the defendants had not, in the first round of summary\n\njudgment filings, sought summary judgment on the ERISA-related\n\nclaims.   That does not amount to a ruling by the court that\n\ndefendants had waived any defenses.    Further, Lugo did not make\n\nthis argument to the magistrate judge; if there has been any waiver\n\nof a claim, it is by Lugo.\n\n\n\n\n     3\n          The record does show Lugo had a degenerative back\ncondition while employed at Stiefel, that accommodations were made\nby his employer, and that he performed his duties on the job. On\nMarch 5, 2004, he sought Social Security benefits, stating that he\nwas unable to work as of the date his employment with Stiefel\nterminated. After benefits were denied, he appealed and asserted\nhe was \"totally disabled.\"    He later voluntarily dismissed the\nappeal.   The issue here is not whether he had a disability but\nwhether he was improperly denied disability benefits.\n\n                                -5-\n\f            We turn to Lugo's final claim, that he was discriminated\n\nagainst in violation of Title VII on the basis of his national\n\norigin because Stifel improperly administered its benefit plans and\n\nexcluded him from participation in its § 401(k) plan.             This claim\n\nis also without merit. First, since Lugo has not demonstrated that\n\nStiefel improperly administered its benefit plans, such an argument\n\nof selective administration based on national origin cannot serve\n\nas the basis of a discrimination claim.\n\n            Additionally, Lugo has presented no argument calling into\n\nquestion the magistrate judge's conclusion that the provider of\n\nStiefel's § 401(k) plan, Fidelity Investments, excluded employees\n\nresiding in Puerto Rico from being plan participants for federal\n\ntax reasons.     The magistrate judge noted that under a qualified\n\n§ 401(k) plan, an employee contributes pre-tax income to the plan,\n\nthus deferring the employee's federal income tax payments.                 But\n\nresidents of Puerto Rico with only local income do not pay federal\n\nincome tax.    See 26 U.S.C. § 933.\n\n            Even were we to assume that Lugo made out a prima facie\n\ncase   of   national   origin   discrimination,   it   is   his   burden   to\n\nestablish that the explanation offered by Stiefel is mere pretext.\n\nQuiñones v. Buick, 436 F.3d 284, 289-90 (1st Cir. 2006).             He has\n\nnot met that burden.       The decision not to define § 401(k) plan\n\nparticipants to include Puerto Rican residents is a rational\n\ndistinction and does not constitute national origin discrimination.\n\n\n                                    -6-\n\f          The entry of summary judgment for defendants is affirmed.\n\nCosts are awarded to defendants.\n\n\n\n\n                               -7-\n\f",

First, since Lugo has not demonstrated that Stiefel improperly administered its benefit plans, such an argument of selective administration based on national origin cannot serve as the basis of a discrimination claim.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Lugo has presented no argument calling into question the magistrate judge's conclusion that the provider of Stiefel's § 401(k) plan, Fidelity Investments, excluded employees residing in Puerto Rico from being plan participants for federal tax reasons. The magistrate judge noted that under a qualified § 401 (k) plan, an employee contributes pre-tax income to the plan, thus deferring the employee's federal income tax payments. But residents of Puerto Rico with only local income do not pay federal income tax. <i>See</i> 26 U.S.C. § 933.</p>\n<p>Even were we to assume that Lugo made out a prima facie case of national origin discrimination, it is his burden to establish that the explanation offered by Stiefel is mere pretext. <i>Quinones v. Buick,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">436</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">284</span></span>, 289-90 (1st Cir.2006). He has not met that burden. The decision not to define § 401 (k) plan participants to include Puerto Rican residents is a rational distinction and does not constitute national origin discrimination.</p>\n<p>The entry of summary judgment for defendants is affirmed. Costs are awarded to defendants.</p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[*]  Of the Southern District of New York, sitting by designation.</p>\n<p>[1]  Lugo also briefly makes the argument that his employment was terminated in retaliation for his \"opposition to the improper administration and management of his benefits,\" in violation of ERISA § 510, 29 U.S.C. § 1140. As the magistrate judge pointed out, this argument is foreclosed by the court's determination in the first summary judgment motion that his employment was terminated because Stiefel substantially reduced its Puerto Rican operations.</p>\n<p>[2]  Similarly, to the extent that Lugo's claim that Stiefel did not furnish documents relates to the employee stock benefit plan in which he was participating, he relies on bald assertions that information was withheld and has provided no evidence to support his claim, including any evidence that he actually requested the information.</p>\n<p>[3]  The record does show Lugo had a degenerative back condition while employed at Stiefel, that accommodations were made by his employer, and that he performed his duties on the job. On March 5, 2004, he sought Social Security benefits, stating that he was unable to work as of the date his employment with Stiefel terminated. After benefits were denied, he appealed and asserted he was \"totally disabled.\" He later voluntarily dismissed the appeal. The issue here is not whether he had a disability but whether he was improperly denied disability benefits.</p>\n\n</div>",
