Allen Mukamusoni, a woman native\n\nto Uganda and a citizen of both Uganda and Rwanda, entered the\n\nUnited States at Houston, Texas, on May 5, 1998 as a non-immigrant\n\nvisitor for pleasure, with authorization to remain until November\n\n4, 1998.   Mukamusoni remained in the United States beyond November\n\n4, 1998, and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS)1\n\ncharged her with removability.     Before Mukamusoni was charged with\n\nremovability, she submitted an application for asylum, withholding\n\nof removal, protection under the Convention Against Torture (CAT),\n\nand voluntary departure.        The Immigration Judge (IJ) granted\n\nvoluntary departure but denied her all other forms of relief on\n\nJanuary 24, 2001, and the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA)\n\ndismissed her appeal on April 22, 2003. Mukamusoni then petitioned\n\nthis court for review.    We vacate the BIA's order and remand.\n\n                                   I.\n\n           We   recount   the   facts    as   they   are   presented   in\n\nMukamusoni's oral testimony before the IJ and in documentation\n\nsubmitted in support of her application for asylum.\n\n           Mukamusoni was born to Rwandan refugee parents on May 17,\n\n1977, in a Rwandan refugee camp in Uganda.       Her mother was a Tutsi\n\nwhile her father was a Hutu, and she had six siblings.           She had\n\n\n1\n    In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were\ntransferred into the new Department of Homeland Security and\nreorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement\n(BICE). For simplicity, we refer to the agency throughout this\nopinion as the INS.\n\n                                   -2-\n\f\"always considered [her]self Rwandese.\"           Her father worked for a\n\nUgandan family in Mbarara, Uganda, and that family told government\n\nofficials that Mukamusoni was their daughter so that she could\n\nattend school in Uganda.     Mukamusoni was thus able to attend St.\n\nMary's, a Catholic boarding school, and lived with the nuns of St.\n\nMary's at their convent in Uganda.\n\n            Mukamusoni's family lived in Uganda until 1993, when\n\nevery member of the family except Mukamusoni returned to Rwanda.\n\nMukamusoni explained that at that time, many Rwandans in Uganda\n\ndecided to return to Rwanda in order to \"fight for their rights.\"\n\nThe Rwandan migration was also partly due to Uganda's policy, which\n\nadvocated    the   repatriation   of    Rwandan     refugees   to   Rwanda.\n\nMukamusoni herself stayed behind in Uganda to continue high school\n\nat St. Mary's.\n\n            In 1994, civil war broke out in Rwanda. According to the\n\n1999 Human Rights Watch Report for Rwanda (which was admitted into\n\nevidence), in 1994 \"the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), composed\n\nlargely of Tutsi refugees who had spent decades in exile, defeated\n\nthe Rwandan government, made up primarily of Hutu, who form the\n\ngreat majority of the Rwandan population. . . . [T]he [Hutu-\n\ndominated] government and army carried out a genocide of more than\n\nhalf a million Tutsi until they were stopped by the RPF.\"             After\n\ntheir defeat, members of the former government became leaders of\n\nthe Hutu rebels, and \"[s]ome of the insurgents, including several\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\fsenior officers who led the 1994 genocide, seemed ready to continue\n\nannihilating the Tutsi.\"\n\n          During the genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda, Mukamusoni's\n\nfather was originally in the army of the Rwandan Patriotic Front\n\n(RPF), but after some time he decided to desert the RPF and joined\n\nthe Hutu rebels because he was Hutu himself.    Mukamusoni's eldest\n\nbrother joined her father with the Hutu rebel forces during the\n\nwar, and he was killed in Kigali, Rwanda in 1994.      Mukamusoni's\n\nother siblings and her mother lived in a refugee camp at Mutara,\n\nRwanda during this time.   Mukamusoni said that even though a Hutu\n\nlaw required \"a Hutu man married to a Tutsi woman to kill his\n\nwife,\" Mukamusoni's father refused to kill his wife because he was\n\nin love with her.    But later, a Hutu death squad came to the\n\nrefugee camp and slaughtered Mukamusoni's mother and her remaining\n\nsiblings, along with many other refugees.\n\n          Through most of the genocide, Mukamusoni was in Uganda.\n\nShe returned to Rwanda in 1995, when the civil war in Rwanda slowed\n\ndown, to take the university entrance exams and to be with her\n\nfamily. While in Rwanda preparing for the exams, she received news\n\nof the massacre of her mother and siblings.    Mukamusoni decided to\n\nattend the funeral for her mother, siblings, and other victims of\n\nthe massacre, even though it was very dangerous for her because of\n\nher Hutu heritage and the fact that most of the people there were\n\nTutsi.   Mukamusoni testified that at the funeral there were \"[s]o\n\n\n                               -4-\n\fmany people\" dead and the bodies were \"cut in pieces\" and \"mixed\n\nup\" and buried in the same grave yard, such that one \"couldn't tell\n\nwho is who.\"    In fact, Mukamusoni was unable to identify the\n\nremains of her youngest sibling.\n\n          At the funeral, she also saw her father, who could not\n\nstay long because the Tutsi in the RPF were looking for him.        (By\n\nthen the RPF was in control of the government of Rwanda.)        He told\n\nher that he was leaving Rwanda for Zaire (now Congo) with the other\n\nHutu rebels.   According to the 1999 Human Rights Watch Report for\n\nRwanda, after the RPF victory, the Hutu rebels led \"some two\n\nmillion Rwandans into exile, more than half of them to Zaire.\"\n\n          Mukamusoni began her studies at the National University\n\nof Rwanda in Butare, Rwanda in May 1996.        She introduced into\n\nevidence a copy of her Rwandan identity card and a copy of her\n\nstudent identity card at the National University of Rwanda.         The\n\nRPF government posted soldiers, most of whom were Tutsi, at the\n\nentrances of the University in order to prevent a repeat of the\n\nHutu rebels' massacre of the students, which had occurred in 1994\n\nduring the genocide.    The soldiers and other students began to\n\nharass Mukamusoni because she was using her father's last name,\n\nMukarazizi, which they recognized as the name of a known Hutu\n\nrebel.    Mukamusoni   studied   journalism   and   was   an   outspoken\n\nproponent of ethnic reconciliation between the Hutu and the Tutsi.\n\nIn response, the Tutsi soldiers and their student affiliates banned\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\fher from publishing letters in the school newspaper and told other\n\nstudents not to listen to her.           She received letters from her\n\nfather from time to time informing her that he was alive, but these\n\nletters were interpreted by the RPF soldiers as evidence of her\n\nespionage with a Hutu rebel.       As a result, she was \"pulled from\n\nclass\" and questioned by the soldiers.\n\n              At the end of her first semester, Mukamusoni was again\n\ntaken from class to the RPF office, where her student ID and\n\nRwandan passport were taken from her so that she could not travel\n\nand   leave    Rwanda.   The   soldiers    interrogated   her   about   her\n\ncorrespondence with her father and his whereabouts; although she\n\nshowed them her father's letters and explained that she knew\n\nnothing about the plans of the rebels, the soldiers did not believe\n\nher and thought she was lying.           She was arrested and taken to\n\nprison in Butare, Rwanda, where she was imprisoned for four months.\n\nDuring this time she was beaten every morning, interrogated twice\n\nper week, and tortured by various kinds of forced activity: rolling\n\nin dry grass in the mornings as a form of \"wake up\"; walking \"miles\n\nand miles\" to exhaustion; digging ditches; digging through giant\n\nanthills in hot weather to retrieve the queen ant while being\n\nbeaten until she passed out; and doing other kinds of manual labor.\n\nWithin the first week of her imprisonment she was raped by a Tutsi\n\nsoldier at the prison.      This was her first experience of sexual\n\nintercourse, and she was terrified that she would contract AIDS or\n\n\n                                   -6-\n\fbecome pregnant from the rape.              During her imprisonment, she\n\n\"wished for death\" and \"had no hope for the future.\"             But, to her\n\nsurprise, she was released when the RPF government realized that\n\nshe had no information about her father. Her passport was returned\n\nto her, and she finished her first year at the University in 1997.\n\n            In 1997, after her release from prison, she received a\n\nletter from someone claiming to be a friend of her father's\n\ninforming her that her father had been killed by the Tutsi in\n\nKibeho, Zaire.      Because the letter was from a Hutu rebel, it was\n\nnot signed.       From that point on, Mukamusoni received no further\n\ncommunications from her father.\n\n            According to the 1999 Human Rights Watch Report for\n\nRwanda, \"[i]n refugee camps [in Zaire], remnants of the defeated\n\n[rebel    Hutu]    army   rearmed,   recruited   new   forces,    and   began\n\nincursions into Rwanda.         In 1996, [Tutsi] Rwandan troops . . .\n\ndispers[ed] the camps, massacring tens of thousands of unarmed\n\ncivilians, and killing thousands of soldiers and militia.\"\n\n             In her removal proceedings, the INS lawyer and the IJ\n\nboth questioned Mukamusoni about whether she could present death\n\ncertificates for her family.         She testified that she \"never even\n\nheard about . . . death certificates. . . . They don't give out\n\ndeath    certificates     in   [Rwanda],\"    especially   not   \"during   the\n\ngenocide.\"    Nor did she know if they gave out death certificates in\n\nZaire, where her father had died, as she had never been there.\n\n\n                                     -7-\n\f            Mukamusoni spent the summer of 1997 back in Uganda at St.\n\nMary's convent.       She told Sister Catherine, a nun to whom she was\n\nvery close, her fears of returning to Rwanda in light of her\n\nexperiences there.      However, Sister Catherine urged her to return\n\nto Rwanda to continue her studies.            Because she had lost her entire\n\nfamily and had no means of economic support, Mukamusoni decided\n\nthat she had to return to school in Rwanda.\n\n            When Mukamusoni started her second year at the University\n\nin 1997 she changed her last name on the student ID from her\n\nfather's name (Mukarazizi) to her own (Mukamusoni), in the hope\n\nthat the    RPF   soldiers      would   stop    harassing   her.     Mukamusoni\n\nexplained that in Africa it was not necessary that children have\n\nthe same last name as their parents.           But, this name change did not\n\nwork   because    a    fellow    student,      Ndemezo,   found    out   through\n\nMukamusoni's classmates that she was Hutu and that her father was\n\na Hutu rebel. Ndemezo, a Tutsi, targeted Mukamusoni for harassment\n\nbecause he felt that she helped to kill his family and reported her\n\nto his brother, who was a soldier in the RPF.                     Ndemezo stole\n\nMukamusoni's Ugandan passport.          Later in the year, Mukamusoni was\n\nagain arrested by the RPF and, this time, she spent two months in\n\nprison.    She was beaten, forced to do manual labor, and raped by a\n\ndifferent Tutsi soldier. The RPF again interrogated her concerning\n\nher father and her travels to Uganda, believing that she was\n\nreceiving information from Hutu rebels.            She gave the soldiers all\n\n\n                                        -8-\n\fthe information they sought, including the address of St. Mary's\n\nconvent in Uganda.    Although she showed the soldiers the letter\n\ncontaining news of her father's death, the RPF continued to believe\n\nthat her father was alive. The soldiers finally released her after\n\nshe threatened to kill herself.     After she was released, she was\n\npunished each day with manual labor tasks that took all day such as\n\nfarming and cleaning university facilities, such that it was nearly\n\nimpossible for her to attend class.\n\n            After a few weeks of trying to do manual labor and to\n\nattend class, Mukamusoni escaped to St. Mary's convent in Uganda.\n\nThere she was confronted on several occasions by Ugandan and RPF\n\nsoldiers.    Mukamusoni explained that Ugandan soldiers worked with\n\nthe RPF because Uganda had supported the Tutsi during the civil\n\nwar. One of Mukamusoni's friends, Fi Fi, informed Sister Catherine\n\nthat RPF soldiers were planning to arrest Mukamusoni in Uganda.\n\nSister Catherine then took Mukamusoni to a remote village where she\n\ncould hide while Sister Catherine obtained on Mukamusoni's behalf\n\na Ugandan passport, a tourist visa to the United States, and a\n\nplane ticket.\n\n            Sister Catherine believed that Mukamusoni should go back\n\nto Rwanda to get her college transcripts so that she could continue\n\nher studies in the United States.      Although Mukamusoni pled with\n\nSister Catherine and explained to Sister Catherine that such a trip\n\nwould be very dangerous, Sister Catherine insisted that it was very\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fimportant.     At Sister Catherine's urging, Mukamusoni returned to\n\nRwanda on February 17, 1998, to obtain her transcripts.              She heard\n\nfrom Fi Fi that the RPF was planning to arrest her, and she\n\nimmediately    fled   back   to   Uganda   ten   days    later,   without   her\n\ntranscripts.    Upon her return, she stayed for a short time at the\n\nconvent before going back to the remote village to hide.             While she\n\nwas at the convent soldiers hid outside the convent, waiting to\n\ninterrogate her.      Mukamusoni also returned to Rwanda one more time\n\nin another aborted attempt to get her transcripts, staying for only\n\na few days this time because she again heard that the RPF planned\n\nto arrest her.     Mukamusoni introduced into evidence a copy of her\n\nUgandan passport.\n\n           Mukamusoni returned to the convent at the end of April\n\n1998 to get her plane ticket, and Sister Catherine died of cancer\n\nshortly after that.     Mukamusoni left Uganda and entered the United\n\nStates at Houston, Texas, on May 5, 1998 with a six-month visitor's\n\nvisa.   Her luggage was lost by the airline.            Many of her personal\n\ndocuments, such as her Rwandan passport and the letter informing\n\nher of her father's death, were lost along with the luggage.\n\nMukamusoni     introduced    into   evidence     an     apology   letter    from\n\nNorthwest Airlines and the lost luggage tracing claim forms.\n\n           Mukamusoni moved to Waltham, Massachusetts, where she\n\nlived with a distant relative and worked as a babysitter.              On May\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\f10, 1999, she applied for asylum in the United States, a few days\n\nmore than one year after she entered the United States.2\n\n          In August of 1999, Dr. Rachel Wolfe, a psychologist of\n\nthe Cambridge Health Alliance, began to evaluate Mukamusoni, upon\n\nreferral by Mukamusoni's counsel.         Dr. Wolfe conducted three\n\nclinical interviews with Mukamusoni and recorded her findings in a\n\npsychological evaluation completed on October 1, 1999.                   This\n\nevaluation and a set of notes maintained by Dr. Wolfe during the\n\ntime she saw Mukamusoni were submitted into evidence.              Dr. Wolfe\n\nfound Mukamusoni to be a \"reliable historian\" whose \"account of her\n\nexperience was consistent across interviews.\" Dr. Wolfe wrote that\n\nMukamusoni suffered from ulcers \"developed in prison,\" and that she\n\nsought HIV testing to be sure that she did not have AIDS.                 Dr.\n\nWolfe reported that every night, Mukamusoni experienced nightmares\n\nof her tortures in prison and the killings of her family, waking to\n\nthe \"sound of her own screams or to a pillow wet with her tears.\"\n\nShe   wrote   that   Mukamusoni    \"fe[lt]    flooded       with    terror,\"\n\n\"experienc[ed]   overwhelming     grief   .   .   .   and     feelings     of\n\nhelplessness and hopelessness,\" \"felt cut off from people,\" and had\n\nlittle control   over   her   crying   spells.    Dr.   Wolfe      described\n\nMukamusoni as having a restricted range of emotion, which she said\n\nis typical of trauma victims, and that Mukamusoni had a \"sense of\n\n\n2\n    An application for asylum must be filed within one year unless\nexcused by changed or extraordinary circumstances. 8 U.S.C. §§\n1158(a)(2)(B), (D).\n\n                                  -11-\n\fforeshortened future\" where she did not \"expect to live long.\" Dr.\n\nWolfe   also   wrote   that   Mukamusoni      had   difficulty      falling   and\n\nremaining asleep at night, \"unable to get thoughts of her family\n\nand fears of what will happen to her out of her mind.\"\n\n           Based on Mukamusoni's symptoms, Dr. Wolfe diagnosed her\n\nwith Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).            Beyond the diagnosis\n\nof PTSD, Dr. Wolfe reported that Mukamusoni's behavior during her\n\ninterviews (including low voice and low level of energy) was\n\ntypical of individuals experiencing a \"Major Depressive Disorder\"\n\nunder the definition of the American Psychiatric Association's\n\nDiagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders.                Dr. Wolfe\n\nrecommended that Mukamusoni receive \"individual psychotherapy and\n\npsychopharmacology,\" and \"antidepressant medication for her post-\n\ntraumatic and depressive symptoms.\"            Mukamusoni began to receive\n\npsychotherapy from Dr. Wolfe, and she was also given Prozac.                  Dr.\n\nWolfe noted that Mukamusoni \"appear[ed] to have the drive and\n\nintelligence to create a productive life for herself in the United\n\nStates.\"     Dr. Wolfe noted that Mukamusoni was \"enthusiastic and\n\ncompliant\"     in   treatment,   but    was   not   reliable   in    making   her\n\nappointments.       After a few more sessions, Mukamusoni did not\n\ncontinue to see Dr. Wolfe for treatment.\n\n           The INS rejected Mukamusoni's application on October 15,\n\n1999, because she missed the one-year filing deadline.                    See 8\n\nU.S.C. § 1158(a)(2)(B); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.4(a). On October 27, 1999,\n\n\n                                       -12-\n\fthe INS issued a Notice to Appear, charging her with removability\n\nas    an   alien    who    remained     in     the    United     States       longer   than\n\npermitted.\n\n                                             II.\n\n             Removal proceedings for Mukamusoni commenced before an IJ\n\non January 12, 2000; Mukamusoni conceded removability and relied on\n\nher application for asylum, withholding of removal, protection\n\nunder the CAT, and voluntary departure.                     A merits hearing was held\n\non April 27, 2000, and continued on January 24, 2001.\n\n             During       the   April   27,        2000    hearing,     the    IJ   excused\n\nMukamusoni's late filing of her asylum application because the IJ\n\nfound her to be suffering from PTSD during the year that she was in\n\nthe    United      States,      and   that    this        constituted    \"extraordinary\n\ncircumstances\" justifying the late filing.                     No dispute remains as\n\nto the timeliness of her filing.\n\n             Mukamusoni testified to the events in her application and\n\naffidavit as recounted above. She testified that she was afraid to\n\ngo back either to Uganda or Rwanda for fear that she would be\n\ntortured due to her Hutu ethnicity and the political activities of\n\nher father.     She testified that she had heard from her friend Fi Fi\n\nthat soldiers still went by St. Mary's to ask the nuns about\n\nMukamusoni's whereabouts.\n\n             Mukamusoni offered to have Dr. Wolfe testify at the\n\noriginal hearing on April 27, 2000, but was told by the IJ to wait\n\n\n                                             -13-\n\ffor a later date as the IJ wanted to hear Mukamusoni's testimony\n\nfirst.     Mukamusoni again offered to have Dr. Wolfe testify by\n\ntelephone at the January 24, 2001 hearing, but the IJ denied that\n\nrequest as well on the ground that the witness was available.                   Dr.\n\nWolfe, however, was not available to appear for the later date and\n\nso did not testify.\n\n            At   the   April    27,   2000   hearing,        the   IJ    granted   a\n\ncontinuance to January 24, 2001 in part to allow Mukamusoni to\n\nobtain additional documentation, including a death certificate for\n\nher father, medical records, and a letter from her friend Fi Fi.\n\nAt the later date, Mukamusoni submitted her medical records into\n\nevidence.    The government objected on the ground that Dr. Wolfe,\n\nthe maker of the records, was not available to be cross-examined.\n\nThe IJ nonetheless made the records part of the record, agreeing to\n\nconsider them de bene in light of the objection.                        The IJ also\n\ndenied Mukamusoni's attempt to introduce an affidavit documenting\n\nthe     (ultimately    unsuccessful)     attempts       to     secure      a   death\n\ncertificate for her father.\n\n            The IJ finally denied Mukamusoni's application for asylum\n\n\"as a matter of discretion\" in an oral decision dated January 24,\n\n2001.     The IJ also denied the applications for withholding of\n\nremoval and CAT protection but granted her voluntary departure.\n\n            The IJ found that Mukamusoni \"has not established the\n\ntruthfulness     of    what    is   stated   in   her   asylum      application,\n\n\n                                      -14-\n\fdocumentation in support thereof, and her testimony in these\n\nproceedings.\"    That was because, in the IJ's view, \"[a] reasonable\n\nperson, similarly situated as [Mukamusoni] on this record would not\n\nfear persecution or have a well-founded fear of persecution on\n\naccount of [one of the five statutory grounds listed in 8 U.S.C. §\n\n1101(a)(42)(A)].\"    The IJ found that Mukamusoni's testimony was\n\n\"self-serving\" and \"[left] a lot to the imagination\" and determined\n\nthat she gave \"no evidence\" and \"no corroboration\" concerning her\n\nexperiences.\n\n          On appeal to the BIA, Mukamusoni argued that the IJ had\n\nfailed to give her the benefit of the regulatory presumption of a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution for establishing past\n\npersecution.    See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1).          She also argued that\n\nthe IJ misapplied the \"reasonable person\" test set out in Matter of\n\nMogharrabi, 19 I. & N. Dec. 439, 445 (BIA 1987).                Finally, she\n\nargued that the IJ abused his discretion by failing to consider her\n\ncase fully, and in particular, the IJ offered no substantive basis\n\nfor his adverse credibility findings.\n\n          On April 22, 2003, the BIA denied her appeal.               In its\n\ndecision, the BIA found it unnecessary to address the adverse\n\ncredibility    findings   of   the   IJ     and   implicitly   accepted   that\n\nMukamusoni was credible.3      It nonetheless found Mukamusoni \"failed\n\n\n\n3\n   The government explicitly adopted the position that the BIA\ntreated Mukamusoni's testimony as credible during oral argument.\n\n                                     -15-\n\fto meet her burden of proof in establishing past persecution or a\n\nwell-founded fear of future persecution.\"       Even though the BIA\n\nproceeded on the assumption that Mukamusoni was credible, it found\n\nher testimony to be \"vague regarding key elements of her asylum\n\nclaim\" and \"scant and generalized.\"     For example, the BIA found it\n\nsignificant that Mukamusoni \"testified that she was raped during\n\nher incarcerations, but provided no details about the incidents.\"\n\nIt discussed Dr. Wolfe's psychological evaluation only in the sense\n\nof holding it against Mukamusoni because she did not continue to\n\nappear for treatment.    The BIA also found that Mukamusoni did not\n\nprovide sufficient corroborating evidence to support her claim, and\n\nthat such corroboration was necessary because her testimony was not\n\n\"sufficiently    detailed.\"    Finally,   the   BIA   determined   that\n\nMukamusoni's decision to return to school in Rwanda after her first\n\narrest and to return to Rwanda on two occasions to retrieve her\n\ncollege transcripts undercut the genuineness of her subjective\n\nfear.\n\n             On May 20, 2003, Mukamusoni timely petitioned this court\n\nfor review of the BIA's decision to affirm the IJ's decision.\n\n                                 III.\n\n          It is the BIA's decision, as the final agency order, that\n\nwe review.    See Georcely v. Ashcroft, 375 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir.\n\n2004); Albathani v. INS, 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir. 2003).         We\n\nreview the BIA's determination that Mukamusoni failed to meet her\n\n\n                                 -16-\n\fburden    of    proof    under   the     deferential     substantial           evidence\n\nstandard.

Our review is on the whole record, not\n\nsolely on the evidence that supports the BIA's determination.\n\nGailius v. INS, 147 F.3d 34, 44 (1st Cir. 1998).                    \"[D]eference is\n\nnot due [to the BIA] where findings and conclusions are based on\n\ninferences or presumptions that are not reasonably grounded in the\n\nrecord, viewed as a whole, or are merely personal views of the\n\nimmigration judge.\"         Cordero-Trejo v. INS, 40 F.3d 482, 487 (1st\n\nCir. 1994) (citations omitted).             \"[W]e may not affirm the BIA's\n\ndecision 'when we cannot conscientiously find that the evidence\n\nsupporting that decision is substantial, when viewed in the light\n\nthat the record in its entirety furnishes, including the body of\n\nevidence opposed to the Board's view.'\"                Gailius, 147 F.3d at 44\n\n(quoting Universal Camera Corp. v. NLRB, 340 U.S. 474, 488 (1951))\n\n(alteration omitted).        The BIA's legal conclusions are reviewed de\n\nnovo, \"with appropriate deference to the agency's interpretation of\n\nthe   underlying     statute     in   accordance      with    administrative       law\n\nprinciples.\"       Id. at 43.\n\n               An asylum applicant bears the burden of proving that he\n\nor she is \"unable or unwilling to return to [the applicant's\n\ncountry of nationality] . . . because of persecution or a well-\n\nfounded    fear     of    persecution     on   account       of    race,   religion,\n\nnationality, membership in a particular social group, or political\n\n\n                                        -17-\n\fopinion.\"      8 U.S.C. § 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(a).\n\nApplicants    may   meet   this   burden   in   one   of   two   ways:   1)   by\n\ndemonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution on account of one\n\nof the statutory grounds, or 2) by establishing past persecution on\n\naccount of one of the statutory grounds so as to be entitled to a\n\npresumption of a well-founded fear of persecution.                Mihaylov v.\n\nAshcroft, 379 F.3d 15, 21 (1st Cir. 2004); 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b).\n\n            Once an applicant has been found to be entitled to the\n\nbenefit of such a regulatory presumption based on past persecution,\n\nthe presumption may be rebutted by a finding that either \"[t]here\n\nhas been a fundamental change in circumstances such that the\n\napplicant no longer has a well-founded fear of persecution in the\n\napplicant's country of nationality,\" or \"[t]he applicant could\n\navoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the\n\napplicant's country.\"       El Moraghy v. Ashcroft, 331 F.3d 195, 203\n\n(1st Cir. 2003) (quoting 8 C.F.R. §§ 1208.13(b)(1)(i)(A)-(B))\n\n(alterations in original).         The government bears the burden of\n\nrebutting the presumption by a preponderance of the evidence.                  8\n\nC.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1)(ii).\n\n             An applicant must pass both an objective and subjective\n\ntest to show a well-founded fear of future persecution.                       El\n\nMoraghy, 331 F.3d at 203; Velasquez v. Ashcroft, 342 F.3d 55, 58-59\n\n(1st Cir. 2003).      The subjective test requires the applicant to\n\nprove his fear is genuine, while the objective test requires\n\n\n                                    -18-\n\fshowing    by    credible   and    specific    evidence   that    this   fear   is\n\nreasonable.      El Moraghy, 331 F.3d at 203.\n\n            We conclude on this record, taking Mukamusoni as credible\n\nas the BIA did, that substantial evidence does not support the\n\nBIA's     conclusion   that       Mukamusoni    failed    to    establish     past\n\npersecution on account of her mixed Hutu/Tutsi heritage and/or the\n\npolitical activities of her father.             The BIA committed errors of\n\nlaw and misapplied the law by focusing narrowly on only parts of\n\nthe record that supported its decision, by raising too high the bar\n\nfor an asylum claimant seeking to prove past persecution or a well-\n\nfounded fear of future persecution, by unreasonably evaluating the\n\nrecord, and by excessively demanding corroborative evidence.                    We\n\nexplain these errors below.\n\n            If the BIA had squarely found her credible, then on this\n\nrecord, it is very likely that we would have been compelled to\n\nconclude that Mukamusoni had established past persecution with\n\nrespect to her testimony of the events in Rwanda.4                    See, e.g.,\n\nKnezevic    v.    Ashcroft,   367     F.3d    1206,   1212     (9th   Cir.   2004)\n\n\n4\n   Although the BIA's decision begins by noting that Mukamusoni is\na \"native and citizen of Uganda\" who, on appeal, claims that she\n\"established past persecution . . . in Uganda,\" the decision then\ngoes on to discuss exclusively her testimony of events in Rwanda\nand persecution by the Rwandan government.        The BIA treated\nMukamusoni's nationality as Rwandan for asylum purposes, and we\nwill frame our review accordingly.     \"'[A] reviewing court must\njudge the propriety of administrative action solely by the grounds\ninvoked by the agency . . . .'\" Gailius, 147 F.3d at 44 (quoting\nSEC v. Chenery Corp., 332 U.S. 194, 196 (1947)) (alterations\nomitted).\n\n                                       -19-\n\f(reversing BIA's finding that there was no past persecution and\n\nholding that record compels conclusion that asylum applicants\n\nsuffered past persecution); Bellido v. Ashcroft, 367 F.3d 840, 846\n\n(8th Cir. 2004) (same).            In that event, she would have been\n\nentitled to a regulatory presumption of having met her burden of\n\nproof with respect to fear of future persecution, and we would\n\nremand for further proceedings on the basis that she had met that\n\nburden.        However, since the BIA declined to reach the adverse\n\ncredibility findings of the IJ but assumed credibility, we vacate\n\nthe BIA's order and remand for further proceedings in light of this\n\nopinion.\n\nThe record and Mukamusoni's burden of proof\n\n               Because the BIA \"d[id] not find it necessary to address\n\n[Mukamusoni's] credibility\" and solely evaluated the sufficiency of\n\nthe evidence to meet Mukamusoni's burden of proof, the BIA treated\n\nher testimony and her supporting documentation as credible.                That\n\nis also the position the government has taken in this court.\n\n               The BIA nonetheless affirmed the IJ's denial of asylum\n\nbecause it found that Mukamusoni \"ha[d] not presented sufficient\n\ndetail so as to provide a plausible and coherent account of the\n\nevents underlying her claim\" and \"failed to meet her burden of\n\nproof     in    establishing    past   persecution.\"        To   support   this\n\nconclusion,       the   BIA    explained      that   \"[w]hile    [Mukamusoni]'s\n\naffidavit was replete with information, her testimony was scant and\n\n\n                                       -20-\n\fgeneralized.\"    Then, while citing and purporting to follow the\n\nanalysis in Matter of Y-B-, 21 I. & N. Dec. 1136 (BIA 1998), the\n\nBIA focused exclusively on Mukamusoni's oral testimony.      The BIA\n\npainted Mukamusoni's oral testimony regarding the circumstances of\n\nher two arrests, incarceration, and release as \"general,\" \"devoid\n\nof information,\" and \"vague[].\"   In particular, the BIA pointed to\n\nthe fact that Mukamusoni provided \"no details\" about her rapes.\n\nThe BIA concluded that Mukamusoni, like the applicant in Matter of\n\nY-B-, \"did not offer critical details in her testimony to furnish\n\ncontext to her claim for asylum.\"      See Matter of Y-B-, 21 I. & N.\n\nDec. at 1137-38.      The record does not support any of these\n\nconclusions.\n\n            The BIA's focus on only the oral evidence was error in\n\ntwo ways.      First, as a matter of fact, Mukamusoni had been\n\nencouraged to keep her oral testimony short because her extensive\n\naffidavit was accepted as the bulk of her testimony; and so the\n\naffidavit could not be discounted.      Further, as a matter of law,\n\nunder INS rules, that affidavit testimony could not be discounted\n\nto the extent the BIA chose to do.       See 8 C.F.R. § 1208.3(c)(1)\n\n(\"[I]nformation provided in the [asylum] application may be used .\n\n. . to satisfy any burden of proof in . . . removal proceedings.\").\n\nIn doing so the BIA committed an error of law.\n\n            The BIA also erred in applying its own precedents.\n\nNothing in Matter of Y-B- supports the BIA's reasoning.     In Matter\n\n\n                                -21-\n\fof Y-B-, the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision to deny a Mauritanian\n\nman's claim for asylum on the ground that the alien failed to meet\n\nhis burden of proof to establish eligibility for asylum.              21 I. &\n\nN. Dec. at 1136-39.       The BIA relied on the fact that the alien's\n\napplication for asylum \"[did] not provide additional information\n\nregarding his claim.      Rather, there [were] significant omissions\n\n[of references to events he orally testified to] in the written\n\napplication.\"    Id. at 1138 (emphasis added).\n\n          In contrast to Matter of Y-B-, the written affidavit of\n\nMukamusoni in support of her asylum application is \"replete with\n\ninformation.\"     Every    single   item   that   the   BIA   found   lacking\n\nsufficient detail in Mukamusoni's oral testimony is supplemented by\n\nadditional detail in her written answers to the asylum application\n\nand the affidavit in support of her application.          For example, the\n\nBIA faulted Mukamusoni for giving only \"general\" oral testimony\n\nabout the \"date or location\" of her arrests, the manner of her\n\narrests, and details concerning her incarceration, interrogation,\n\nand release.    Yet, all of these details are found in her affidavit\n\nand written answers on the asylum application, which are part of\n\nthe record before the BIA.5      The BIA identified no instance where\n\n\n5\n   In some instances, the BIA's finding that Mukamusoni provided\ninsufficient detail is simply not supported even on the basis of\nthe oral testimony alone.      For example, the BIA stated that\nMukamusoni \"testified that she was raped during her incarcerations,\nbut provided no details about the incidents.\" (emphasis added). To\nthe contrary, the transcript of the oral proceedings before the IJ\nreveals the following testimony from Mukamusoni:\n\n                                    -22-\n\fshe testified to significant events that are omitted in the written\n\napplication and affidavit.   Thus, the analysis in Matter of Y-B-\n\ndoes not support the BIA's conclusion.\n\n          The BIA's failure to take into account the evidence in\n\nMukamusoni's application and affidavit is contrary to law and\n\nparticularly egregious in light of the IJ's limitation of oral\n\ntestimony.   We also note that the government did not object to the\n\nadmission of the affidavit information into evidence and had ample\n\nopportunity throughout the proceedings to cross examine her on the\n\ndetails in the affidavit.\n\nLack of corroboration\n\n          The BIA also found that Mukamusoni \"did not provide\n\nsufficient corroborating evidence to support her claim.\"      This\n\nfinding is likewise not supported by substantial evidence.\n\n          Initially, the BIA's finding of lack of corroborative\n\nevidence is linked to its error in not reviewing the entire record,\n\nas noted above.   This is so because \"corroborative evidence is not\n\n\n\n\n          They took me to prison. . . . And then after\n          that there was a, there was a soldier who was\n          like I can take her to help me, to help me in\n          my house. And another woman was no, she can't\n          help you, she can stay here. Then when they\n          refused for him to take me, he raped me.\n\nMukamusoni also testified that a different soldier raped her during\nher second incarceration. At oral argument, the government was\nunable to explain what additional \"details\" concerning the rapes\nmight be relevant.\n\n                                -23-\n\frequired   to    establish     an   asylum    claim;     in   many    cases,   the\n\napplicant's     own    credible     testimony    is    sufficient     to   support\n\neligibility for asylum as long as it provides a basis for a well\n\nfounded fear.\"         Gailius, 147 F.3d at 45; see also 8 C.F.R. §\n\n1208.13(a).      The BIA has also held that \"the weaker an alien's\n\ntestimony [is], the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\"\n\nMatter of Y-B-, 21 I. & N. Dec. at 1139.              Because the BIA failed to\n\nconsider the entire record and found Mukamusoni's testimony weaker\n\nthan it actually was, it demanded a higher level of corroboration\n\nthan it should have.         The \"combination of detailed testimony and\n\ncorroborative     background      evidence\"     is    sufficient     to   establish\n\nMukamusoni's past persecution.          Id.\n\n           In any event, the record does not support the BIA's\n\nconclusion      that    Mukamusoni     insufficiently         corroborated     her\n\ntestimony.      The BIA ignored the presence of the bulk of the\n\ncorroborative evidence in the record and overstated the role of the\n\nabsence of certain pieces of corroborative evidence. In support of\n\nher   application      for   asylum,   Mukamusoni       offered    corroborative\n\nevidence in the form of medical records, country condition reports,\n\nproof of the loss of certain documents from Northwest Airlines, and\n\nidentification documents.            In addition, Mukamusoni offered to\n\nprovide an affidavit explaining why she could not obtain a copy of\n\nher father's death certificate.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -24-\n\f          First, the overwhelming weight of the evidence from the\n\ntwenty-five     pages       of   Dr.    Wolfe's     notes       and   Dr.    Wolfe's\n\npsychological evaluation corroborates Mukamusoni's claims.                       The\n\nrecords are literally replete with information which supports the\n\nsubstance of Mukamusoni's testimony.               Mukamusoni's account of her\n\nexperiences in Rwanda to Dr. Wolfe is also consistent with the\n\naccounts given in her affidavit, application, and oral testimony.\n\nDr.   Wolfe    noted     the      physical       evidence   that      corroborated\n\nMukamusoni's story: ulcers developed in prison, her independently\n\nsought HIV testing in light of her fear of having contracted AIDS\n\nfrom her rapes, trauma-induced PTSD symptoms such as nightmares,\n\nhopelessness, sleeplessness, distrust of others, etc.6\n\n          The    BIA,       however,     found     that   the    medical     records\n\nMukamusoni submitted to bolster her claim actually \"undercut[] her\n\nclaim\" that she suffers from PTSD because the records show that\n\nMukamusoni    \"was    not    sincere    in   her    attempts     to   seek   medical\n\nassistance.\"     The BIA based this conclusion on the following\n\nhandwritten    note     from     Dr.   Wolfe:    \"[Although      enthusiastic    and\n\ncompliant,] [Mukamusoni] was not reliable in coming to therapy and,\n\nafter 2 sessions beyond the asylum eval. indicated that she did not\n\n\n\n6\n   At the end of her evaluation, Dr. Wolfe wrote that Mukamusoni\n\"plan[ned] to resume her journalism studies and ha[d] begun taking\nsome courses at Middlesex Community College,\" which corroborates\nMukamusoni's account of her journalism studies at the National\nUniversity of Rwanda and Sister Catherine's hope that she resume\nher studies in the United States.\n\n                                        -25-\n\fhave time to come.       She recontacted me in early March 2000 because\n\nher final trial was coming up soon.\"7           Even if the BIA were correct\n\nthat this indicated Mukamusoni's lack of dedication in seeking\n\nmedical treatment, it is not clear how this would \"undercut her\n\nclaim\" with respect to her PTSD condition.                  The medical records\n\nwere   submitted    to     corroborate    the   diagnosis      of    her   treating\n\npsychologist      and    the   strength   of    her    fear,   which    are     facts\n\nindependent of her ability to keep appointments.                    To the extent\n\nthat her \"sincerity\" in seeking treatment might be relevant to a\n\ngeneral credibility determination, the BIA already chose not to\n\naddress her credibility.\n\n            The    BIA's    interpretation      of    the   medical    records     is\n\nespecially inexplicable because, within the very same note from\n\nwhich the BIA takes the quote above, Dr. Wolfe reiterates her\n\ndiagnosis    and    recommends      continued        follow-up      treatment    for\n\nMukamusoni with a new therapist, which would be a nonsensical\n\nconclusion if Dr. Wolfe thought Mukamusoni's PTSD to be fabricated.\n\nViewed as a whole, the BIA's finding that the medical records\n\n\"undercut[]\" rather than corroborated Mukamusoni's claim is simply\n\nunsupportable.\n\n\n\n\n7\n  The first bracketed portion is present in the doctor's note but\nomitted by the BIA in its quotation. The word \"eval.\" (presumably\nthe abbreviated form of \"evaluation\") is misquoted as \"level\" in\nthe BIA decision.\n\n                                      -26-\n\f          The BIA also cited the fact that \"[n]otwithstanding the\n\nlong continuance, [Mukamusoni] did not present [Dr. Wolfe] as a\n\nwitness, as she was unavailable\" as further example of lack of\n\ncorroboration.    This is not a fair or accurate characterization of\n\nthe history of the proceedings before the IJ.          The record shows\n\nthat Mukamusoni made repeated offers to have Dr. Wolfe testify,\n\nfirst in person, and then telephonically, but was not allowed to do\n\nso by the IJ.    The record also shows that the \"long continuance\"\n\nwas not granted by the IJ in order to have Mukamusoni secure Dr.\n\nWolfe's testimony.\n\n          There are other pieces of corroborative evidence in the\n\nrecord that the BIA did not discuss and it is unclear whether the\n\nBIA even considered them: the letter from Northwest Airlines and\n\nlost luggage tracing claim forms confirming her lost luggage, her\n\nUgandan passport, her Rwandan identity card, and her student\n\nidentity card at Rwandan National University.            Each of these\n\ndocuments provided corroboration for crucial parts of Mukamusoni's\n\nstory.    For    example,   the   Ugandan   passport   corroborated   her\n\ntestimony as the IJ asked her about her flight between Uganda and\n\nRwanda.\n\n          The BIA also made no mention of the background and\n\ncountry conditions evidence that Mukamusoni submitted into the\n\nrecord.   In reviewing an applicant's claim of credible fear of\n\npersecution, current regulations state that \"the asylum officer may\n\n\n                                   -27-\n\frely on material provided by the Department of State . . . or other\n\ncredible sources, such as international organizations, private\n\nvoluntary agencies, news organizations, or academic institutions.\"\n\n8 C.F.R. § 1208.12.      Mukamusoni submitted into evidence the 1999\n\ncountry conditions reports on Rwanda from Human Rights Watch,\n\nAmnesty International, and the Department of State. Courts and the\n\nBIA routinely used such country condition reports to corroborate\n\nthe testimony of asylum applicants under the old regulations.8         See\n\nEl Moraghy, 331 F.3d at 203-04 (country condition reports \"can\n\neither help or harm a petitioner's case, depending on whether or\n\nnot they corroborate the petitioner's tale\"); see also Cordero-\n\nTrejo, 40 F.3d at 490-91 (incidents of politically, socially or\n\nreligiously motivated persecution of non-prominent individuals in\n\napplicant's   position   in   his   country   of   nationality   bolstered\n\nalien's claim).    It was error for the BIA to have ignored the\n\ncountry condition reports because \"this failure [to evaluate the\n\nreports] unreasonably eviscerate[d] the applicant's attempt to\n\nestablish the objective element of her asylum claim.\"             Cordero-\n\nTrejo, 40 F.3d at 492.\n\n\n\n\n8\n   The old regulations made it clear that credibility should be\njudged \"in light of general conditions in the applicant's country\nof nationality or last habitual residence.\" El Moraghy, 331 F.3d\nat 203.     Although the issue before us is not an agency's\ndetermination of credibility, the country condition reports could\nstill be used to provide corroboration and support the applicant's\nclaims. See id. at 204.\n\n                                    -28-\n\f            Such documentary evidence is \"extremely important for\n\ncontextualizing, in the absence of direct corroboration, the events\n\nwhich [an applicant] claims constitute persecution.\"               Id. at 491.\n\nEven a quick look at the country condition reports demonstrates\n\nthat these reports support Mukamusoni's claims.               See Gailius, 147\n\nF.3d at 45 n.6 (\"[A]n uncorroborated story that is at odds with\n\nwhat is known about country conditions is less likely to be\n\naccurate than one that is consistent with country conditions.\").\n\nFor example, the country reports corroborate Mukamusoni's account\n\nof persons in her father's position joining the Hutu rebels in\n\nZaire and their subsequent deaths in the Kibeho camp. In addition,\n\nthe 1999 Human Rights Watch Report for Rwanda contains descriptions\n\nof the practices of arbitrary detentions, prison abuses, and\n\nmilitary-civilian security sweeps carried out by the RPF government\n\nwhich corroborate Mukamusoni's testimony of her experiences in\n\nRwanda:    \"The government, citing the need for self-defense against\n\nthe insurgency, organized civilians to monitor purportedly anti-\n\ngovernment activity . . . .\"        \"Military, police, and some civilian\n\nofficials took thousands of persons into custody during large-scale\n\nsecurity   sweeps,   residential     inspections,       and   verification   of\n\nidentify    papers   on   the   roads.      Some   of   these    persons   were\n\nsubsequently    released    after    interrogation      that    was   sometimes\n\naccompanied by physical abuse.\" The BIA unreasonably ignored these\n\nreports, and gave no explanation for why it did so.\n\n\n                                     -29-\n\f           Not only did the BIA err in not adequately considering\n\nthe medical records and country condition reports as corroborative\n\nof Mukamusoni's testimony, it also overstated the role of the\n\nabsence of certain pieces of corroborative evidence.                The BIA\n\nplaced   unreasonable   weight    on   the   absence   of   a   letter   from\n\nMukamusoni's   friend   Fi   Fi   corroborating    Mukamusoni's     claims.\n\nMukamusoni originally indicated to the IJ at the April 27, 2000\n\nhearing that she could obtain such a letter.           At the January 24,\n\n2001 hearing, neither the IJ nor the parties brought up the letter\n\nand it is unclear why (it appears that the IJ may not have included\n\nthe request for the letter in his notes of the previous hearing).\n\nMukamusoni did not offer an explanation for this absence before the\n\nIJ and has not offered one on appeal.9       It is true that the absence\n\n\n\n9\n   Mukamusoni's brief claims that her counsel offered to introduce\ninto evidence an affidavit that would have explained the efforts\nmade to obtain these \"documents\" and why the efforts failed (the\ndeath certificate of Mukamusoni's father and the letter from Fi\nFi). This is not consistent with the transcript of the hearing,\nwhich indicates that Mukamusoni's counsel only offered to explain\nthe absence of the death certificate, but not the letter.\n\n     The BIA did not discuss the absence of her father's death\ncertificate and it is unclear whether that played a role in the\nBIA's finding that Mukamusoni did not submit sufficient\ncorroboration. We note in passing that the absence of her father's\ndeath certificate is not particularly probative. \"Persecutors are\nhardly likely to provide their victims with affidavits attesting to\ntheir acts of persecution.\" Bolanos-Hernandez v. INS, 767 F.2d\n1277, 1285 (9th Cir. 1984). It does not appear likely that death\ncertificates would be available for the many individuals who died\nduring the Rwandan genocide, and Mukamusoni offered to document the\nefforts expended to obtain a death certificate for her father (if\nany existed) but that evidence was excluded by the IJ.\n\n                                   -30-\n\fof this letter and any explanation for why it could not be\n\nobtained, when Mukamusoni indicated that it would be available,\n\ncould tend to support the BIA's finding that Mukamusoni did not\n\nproduce sufficient corroboration. However, the absence of this one\n\nletter is insufficient to justify disregarding the corroborative\n\nevidence that Mukamusoni did provide.          On this record, the BIA's\n\nfinding   that   Mukamusoni         failed    to   introduce    sufficient\n\ncorroborative evidence for her asylum claim is not supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence.      See   Albathani, 318 F.3d at 372.\n\nMukamusoni's subjective fear\n\n          Finally,    the    BIA     questioned    the   \"genuineness\"   of\n\nMukamusoni's \"subjective fear of persecution\" in Rwanda because of\n\nher \"decision to remain at the school after two arrests and to\n\nreturn to Rwanda on two occasions after the Rwandan government was\n\nsearching for her.\"        This conclusion is again not supported by\n\nsubstantial evidence in the record.\n\n          First, the conclusion is in error as a matter of law\n\nbecause we find Mukamusoni, if credible, has met her burden of\n\nproof with respect to past persecution in Rwanda, and thus the BIA\n\nerred as a matter of law by denying her the benefit of the\n\nregulatory presumption under 8 C.F.R. § 1208.13(b)(1).\n\n          Second,    the    BIA's    doubts   of   the   \"genuineness\"   of\n\nMukamusoni's subjective fear are contrary to the BIA's decision not\n\nto address her credibility.\n\n\n                                     -31-\n\f             Third, the BIA also does not consider the evidence\n\noutlined above.              In the context of that evidence, the BIA's\n\nassessment does not take into account the reasonable explanations\n\nMukamusoni offered for her decisions to remain at school in Rwanda\n\nafter her first year and to return to Rwanda to obtain her\n\ntranscripts despite the danger of being arrested again. Mukamusoni\n\nspecifically explained that after her first rape, she returned to\n\nSt. Mary's and was fearful of returning to Rwanda.                             However,\n\nbecause the rape was so \"ashaming and embarrassing\" to her, she did\n\nnot   tell   Sister      Catherine        about    the    rape.     It    is   in    these\n\ncircumstances that Sister Catherine then urged her to return to\n\nRwanda and continue her studies, allaying Mukamusoni's fears by\n\nassuring her that the RPF soldiers would not arrest her again now\n\nthat her father was dead.               Mukamusoni was a twenty-year old first-\n\nyear college student at the time and Sister Catherine was her\n\nguiding light.          The assurances by Sister Catherine, as events\n\nunfolded, turned out to be tragically overly optimistic.                               The\n\ndecision     to    remain      in   a    country    in    which   the    applicant     was\n\npersecuted after release from prison does not necessarily undercut\n\nan applicant's claim for asylum, if adequately explained.                             See,\n\ne.g., Turcios v. INS, 821 F.2d 1396, 1401-02 (9th Cir. 1987)\n\n(finding that it was unreasonable for the IJ to determine that the\n\ngovernment        of   the    alien's     country    of    origin   would      not   have\n\npersecuted him because the alien remained in that country for\n\n\n                                            -32-\n\fseveral months after his release from prison when he was under\n\nconstant surveillance).\n\n           Moreover, Mukamusoni testified that after the death of\n\nevery member of her immediate family, she was without any means of\n\neconomic or emotional support excepting the generosity of Sister\n\nCatherine.     She testified in essence that there was literally\n\nnothing for her to do in Uganda or Rwanda; her only means of\n\nobtaining an education was at the National University of Rwanda,\n\nwhere Rwandans are entitled to education at the government's\n\nexpense.     A decision she made to go back to the only place where\n\nshe could obtain a \"free\" education, at Sister Catherine's urging,\n\nis insufficient to show, against this record, that her fears of\n\npersecution in Rwanda were not genuine. Faced with no viable means\n\nof support otherwise, people take risks in the face of their fears.\n\nMukamusoni's     subsequent   entries    into   Rwanda   to   obtain   her\n\ntranscripts were also motivated by both Sister Catherine's urging\n\nand Mukamusoni's desperate attempt to preserve the possibility of\n\na better life through the hope of obtaining an education.10\n\n             Viewing the record as a whole, including the evidence the\n\nBIA ignored and assuming Mukamusoni's credibility as did the BIA,\n\nwe cannot conscientiously find that the evidence supporting the\n\n\n\n\n10\n    There was discussion in the BIA's opinion about Mukamusoni's\ntravels between Uganda and Rwanda, but the BIA's emphasis was on\nher returns to Rwanda.\n\n                                  -33-\n\fBIA's determination that Mukamusoni failed to meet her burden of\n\nproof is substantial. See Universal Camera Corp., 340 U.S. at 488.\n\n                               IV.\n\n          The order of the BIA is vacated and the case remanded for\n\nfurther proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.\n\n\n\n\n                               -34-\n\f",

Her mother was a Tutsi while her father was a Hutu, and she had six siblings. She had \"always considered [her]self Rwandese.\" Her father worked for a Ugandan family in Mbarara, Uganda, and that family told government officials that Mukamusoni was their daughter so that she could attend school in Uganda. Mukamusoni was thus able to attend St. Mary's, a Catholic boarding school, and lived with the nuns of St. Mary's at their convent in Uganda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mukamusoni's family lived in Uganda until 1993, when every member of the family except Mukamusoni returned to Rwanda. Mukamusoni explained that at that time, many Rwandans in Uganda decided to return to Rwanda in order to \"fight for their rights.\" The Rwandan migration was also partly due to Uganda's policy, which advocated the repatriation of Rwandan refugees to Rwanda. Mukamusoni herself stayed behind in Uganda to continue high school at St. Mary's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, civil war broke out in Rwanda. According to the 1999 Human Rights Watch Report for Rwanda (which was admitted into evidence), in 1994 \"the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), composed largely of Tutsi refugees who had spent decades in exile, defeated the Rwandan government, made up primarily of Hutu, who form the great majority of the Rwandan population.... [T]he [Hutu-dominated] government and army carried out a genocide of more than half a million Tutsi until they were stopped by the RPF.\" After their defeat, members of the former government became leaders of the Hutu rebels, and \"[s]ome of the insurgents, including several senior officers who led the 1994 genocide, seemed ready to continue annihilating the Tutsi.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda, Mukamusoni's father was originally in the army of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), but after some time he decided to desert the RPF and joined the Hutu rebels because he was Hutu himself. Mukamusoni's eldest brother joined her father with the Hutu rebel forces during the war, and he was killed in Kigali, Rwanda in 1994. Mukamusoni's other siblings and her mother lived in a refugee camp at Mutara, Rwanda during this time. Mukamusoni said that even though a Hutu law required \"a Hutu man married to a Tutsi woman to kill his wife,\" Mukamusoni's father refused to kill his wife because he was in love with her. But later, a Hutu death squad came to the refugee camp and slaughtered Mukamusoni's mother and her remaining siblings, along with many other refugees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through most of the genocide, Mukamusoni was in Uganda. She returned to Rwanda in 1995, when the civil war in Rwanda slowed down, to take the university entrance exams and to be with her family. While in Rwanda preparing for the exams, she received news of the massacre of her mother and siblings. Mukamusoni decided to attend the funeral for her mother, siblings, and other victims of the massacre, even though it was very dangerous for her because of her Hutu heritage and the fact that most of the people there were Tutsi. Mukamusoni testified that at the funeral there were \"[s]o many people\" dead and the bodies were \"cut in pieces\" and \"mixed up\" and buried in the same grave yard, such that one \"couldn't tell who is who.\" In fact, Mukamusoni was unable to identify the remains of her youngest sibling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the funeral, she also saw her father, who could not stay long because the Tutsi in the RPF were looking for him. (By then the RPF was in control of the government of Rwanda.) He told her that he was leaving Rwanda for Zaire (now Congo) with the other Hutu rebels. According to the 1999 Human Rights Watch Report for Rwanda, after the RPF victory, the Hutu rebels led \"some two million Rwandans into exile, more than half of them to Zaire.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mukamusoni began her studies at the National University of Rwanda in Butare, Rwanda in May 1996. She introduced into evidence a copy of her Rwandan identity card and a copy of her student identity card at the National University of Rwanda. The RPF government posted soldiers, most of whom were Tutsi, at the entrances of the University in order to prevent a repeat of the Hutu rebels' massacre of the students, which had occurred in 1994 during the genocide. The soldiers and other students began to harass Mukamusoni because she was using her father's last name, Mukarazizi, which they recognized as the name of a known Hutu rebel. Mukamusoni studied journalism and was an outspoken proponent of ethnic reconciliation between the Hutu and the Tutsi. In response, the Tutsi soldiers and their student affiliates banned her from publishing letters in the school newspaper and told other students not to listen to her. She received letters from her father from time to time informing her that he was alive, but these letters were interpreted by the RPF soldiers as evidence of her espionage with a Hutu rebel. As a result, she was \"pulled from class\" and questioned by the soldiers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of her first semester, Mukamusoni was again taken from class to the RPF office, where her student ID and Rwandan passport were taken from her so that she could not travel and leave Rwanda. The soldiers interrogated her about her correspondence with her father and his whereabouts; although she showed them her father's letters and explained that she knew nothing about the plans of the rebels, the soldiers did not believe her and thought she was lying. She was arrested and taken to prison in Butare, Rwanda, where she was imprisoned for four months. During this time she was beaten every morning, interrogated twice per week, and tortured by various kinds of forced activity: rolling in dry grass in the mornings as a form of \"wake up\"; walking \"miles and miles\" to exhaustion; digging ditches; digging through giant anthills in hot weather to retrieve the queen ant while being beaten until she passed out; and doing other kinds of manual labor. Within the first week of her imprisonment she was raped by a Tutsi soldier at the prison. This was her first experience of sexual intercourse, and she was terrified that she would contract AIDS or become pregnant from the rape. During her imprisonment, she \"wished for death\" and \"had no hope for the future.\" But, to her surprise, she was released when the RPF government realized that she had no information about her father. Her passport was returned to her, and she finished her first year at the University in 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, after her release from prison, she received a letter from someone claiming to be a friend of her father's informing her that her father had been killed by the Tutsi in Kibeho, Zaire. Because the letter was from a Hutu rebel, it was not signed. From that point on, Mukamusoni received no further communications from her father.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the 1999 Human Rights Watch Report for Rwanda, \"[i]n refugee camps [in Zaire], remnants of the defeated [rebel Hutu] army rearmed, recruited new forces, and began incursions into Rwanda. In 1996, [Tutsi] Rwandan troops ... dispers[ed] the camps, massacring tens of thousands of unarmed civilians, and killing thousands of soldiers and militia.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her removal proceedings, the INS lawyer and the IJ both questioned Mukamusoni about whether she could present death certificates for her family. She testified that she \"never even heard about ... death certificates.... They don't give out death certificates in [Rwanda],\" especially not \"during the genocide.\" Nor did she know if they gave out death certificates in Zaire, where her father had died, as she had never been there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mukamusoni spent the summer of 1997 back in Uganda at St. Mary's convent. She told Sister Catherine, a nun to whom she was very close, her fears of returning to Rwanda in light of her experiences there. However, Sister Catherine urged her to return to Rwanda to continue her studies. Because she had lost her entire family and had no means of economic support, Mukamusoni decided that she had to return to school in Rwanda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Mukamusoni started her second year at the University in 1997 she changed her last name on the student ID from her father's name (Mukarazizi) to her own (Mukamusoni), in the hope that the RPF soldiers would stop harassing her. Mukamusoni explained that in Africa it was not necessary that children have the same last name as their parents. But, this name change did not work because a fellow student, Ndemezo, found out through Mukamusoni's classmates that she was Hutu and that her father was a Hutu rebel. Ndemezo, a Tutsi, targeted Mukamusoni for harassment because he felt that she helped to kill his family and reported her to his brother, who was a soldier in the RPF. Ndemezo stole Mukamusoni's Ugandan passport. Later in the year, Mukamusoni was again arrested by the RPF and, this time, she spent two months in prison. She was beaten, forced to do manual labor, and raped by a different Tutsi soldier. The RPF again interrogated her concerning her father and her travels to Uganda, believing that she was receiving information from Hutu rebels. She gave the soldiers all the information they sought, including the address of St. Mary's convent in Uganda. Although she showed the soldiers the letter containing news of her father's death, the RPF continued to believe that her father was alive. The soldiers finally released her after she threatened to kill herself. After she was released, she was punished each day with manual labor tasks that took all day such as farming and cleaning university facilities, such that it was nearly impossible for her to attend class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a few weeks of trying to do manual labor and to attend class, Mukamusoni escaped to St. Mary's convent in Uganda. There she was confronted on several occasions by Ugandan and RPF soldiers. Mukamusoni explained that Ugandan soldiers worked with the RPF because Uganda had supported the Tutsi during the civil war. One of Mukamusoni's friends, Fi Fi, informed Sister Catherine that RPF soldiers were planning to arrest Mukamusoni in Uganda. Sister Catherine then took Mukamusoni to a remote village where she could hide while Sister Catherine obtained on Mukamusoni's behalf a Ugandan passport, a tourist visa to the United States, and a plane ticket.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sister Catherine believed that Mukamusoni should go back to Rwanda to get her college transcripts so that she could continue her studies in the United States. Although Mukamusoni pled with Sister Catherine and explained to Sister Catherine that such a trip would be very dangerous, Sister Catherine insisted that it was very important. At Sister Catherine's urging, Mukamusoni returned to Rwanda on February 17, 1998, to obtain her transcripts. She heard from Fi Fi that the RPF was planning to arrest her, and she immediately fled back to Uganda ten days later, without her transcripts. Upon her return, she stayed for a short time at the convent before going back to the remote village to hide. While she was at the convent soldiers hid outside the convent, waiting to interrogate her. Mukamusoni also returned to Rwanda one more time in another aborted attempt to get her transcripts, staying for only a few days this time because she again heard that the RPF planned to arrest her. Mukamusoni introduced into evidence a copy of her Ugandan passport.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mukamusoni returned to the convent at the end of April 1998 to get her plane ticket, and Sister Catherine died of cancer shortly after that. Mukamusoni left Uganda and entered the United States at Houston, Texas, on May 5, 1998 with a six-month visitor's visa. Her luggage was lost by the airline. Many of her personal documents, such as her Rwandan passport and the letter informing her of her father's death, were lost along with the luggage. Mukamusoni introduced into evidence an apology letter from Northwest Airlines and the lost luggage tracing claim forms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mukamusoni moved to Waltham, Massachusetts, where she lived with a distant relative and worked as a babysitter. On May 10, 1999, she applied for asylum in the United States, a few days more than one year after she entered the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August of 1999, Dr. Rachel Wolfe, a psychologist of the Cambridge Health Alliance, began to evaluate Mukamusoni, upon referral by Mukamusoni's counsel. Dr. Wolfe conducted three clinical interviews with Mukamusoni and recorded her findings in a psychological evaluation completed on October 1, 1999. This evaluation and a set of notes maintained by Dr. Wolfe during the time she saw Mukamusoni were submitted into evidence. Dr. Wolfe found Mukamusoni to be a \"reliable historian\" whose \"account of her experience was consistent across interviews.\" Dr. Wolfe wrote that Mukamusoni suffered from ulcers \"developed in prison,\" and that she sought HIV testing to be sure that she did not have AIDS. Dr. Wolfe reported that every night, Mukamusoni experienced nightmares of her tortures in prison and the killings of her family, waking to the \"sound of her own screams or to a pillow wet with her tears.\" She wrote that Mukamusoni \"fe[lt] flooded with terror,\" \"experienc[ed] overwhelming grief ... and feelings of helplessness and hopelessness,\" \"felt cut off from people,\" and had little control over her crying spells. Dr. Wolfe described Mukamusoni as having a restricted range of emotion, which she said is typical of trauma victims, and that Mukamusoni had a \"sense of foreshortened future\" where she did not \"expect to live long.\" Dr. Wolfe also wrote that Mukamusoni had difficulty falling and remaining asleep at night, \"unable to get thoughts of her family and fears of what will happen to her out of her mind.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on Mukamusoni's symptoms, Dr. Wolfe diagnosed her with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Beyond the diagnosis of PTSD, Dr. Wolfe reported that Mukamusoni's behavior during her interviews (including low voice and low level of energy) was typical of individuals experiencing a \"Major Depressive Disorder\" under the definition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Dr. Wolfe recommended that Mukamusoni receive \"individual psychotherapy and psychopharmacology,\" and \"antidepressant medication for her post-traumatic and depressive symptoms.\" Mukamusoni began to receive psychotherapy from Dr. Wolfe, and she was also given Prozac. Dr. Wolfe noted that Mukamusoni \"appear [ed] to have the drive and intelligence to create a productive life for herself in the United States.\" Dr. Wolfe noted that Mukamusoni was \"enthusiastic and compliant\" in treatment, but was not reliable in making her appointments. After a few more sessions, Mukamusoni did not continue to see Dr. Wolfe for treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INS rejected Mukamusoni's application on October 15, 1999, because she missed the one-year filing deadline. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(2)(B); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.4(a). On October 27, 1999, the INS issued a Notice to Appear, charging her with removability as an alien who remained in the United States longer than permitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Removal proceedings for Mukamusoni commenced before an IJ on January 12, 2000; Mukamusoni conceded removability and relied on her application for asylum, withholding of removal, protection under the CAT, and voluntary departure. A merits hearing was held on April 27, 2000, and continued on January 24, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the April 27, 2000 hearing, the IJ excused Mukamusoni's late filing of her asylum application because the IJ found her to be suffering from PTSD during the year that she was in the United States, and that this constituted \"extraordinary circumstances\" justifying the late filing. No dispute remains as to the timeliness of her filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mukamusoni testified to the events in her application and affidavit as recounted above. She testified that she was afraid to go back either to Uganda or Rwanda for fear that she would be tortured due to her Hutu ethnicity and the political activities of her father. She testified that she had heard from her friend Fi Fi that soldiers still went by St. Mary's to ask the nuns about Mukamusoni's whereabouts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mukamusoni offered to have Dr. Wolfe testify at the original hearing on April 27, 2000, but was told by the IJ to wait for a later date as the IJ wanted to hear Mukamusoni's testimony first. Mukamusoni again offered to have Dr. Wolfe testify by telephone at the January 24, 2001 hearing, but the IJ denied that request as well on the ground that the witness was available. Dr. Wolfe, however, was not available to appear for the later date and so did not testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the April 27, 2000 hearing, the IJ granted a continuance to January 24, 2001 in part to allow Mukamusoni to obtain additional documentation, including a death certificate for her father, medical records, and a letter from her friend Fi Fi. At the later date, Mukamusoni submitted her medical records into evidence. The government objected on the ground that Dr. Wolfe, the maker of the records, was not available to be cross-examined. The IJ nonetheless made the records part of the record, agreeing to consider them <i>de bene</i> in light of the objection. The IJ also denied Mukamusoni's attempt to introduce an affidavit documenting the (ultimately unsuccessful) attempts to secure a death certificate for her father.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ finally denied Mukamusoni's application for asylum \"as a matter of discretion\" in an oral decision dated January 24, 2001. The IJ also denied the applications for withholding of removal and CAT protection but granted her voluntary departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ found that Mukamusoni \"has not established the truthfulness of what is stated in her asylum application, documentation in support thereof, and her testimony in these proceedings.\" That was because, in the IJ's view, \"[a] reasonable person, similarly situated as [Mukamusoni] on this record would not fear persecution or have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of [one of the five statutory grounds listed in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A)].\" The IJ found that Mukamusoni's testimony was \"self-serving\" and \"[left] a lot to the imagination\" and determined that she gave \"no evidence\" and \"no corroboration\" concerning her experiences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal to the BIA, Mukamusoni argued that the IJ had failed to give her the benefit of the regulatory presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution for establishing past persecution. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.13(b)(1). She also argued that the IJ misapplied the \"reasonable person\" test set out in <i>Matter of Mogharrabi,</i> 19 I. &amp; N. Dec. 439, 445, 1987 WL 108943 (BIA 1987). Finally, she argued that the IJ abused his discretion by failing to consider her case fully, and in particular, the IJ offered no substantive basis for his adverse credibility findings.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On April 22, 2003, the BIA denied her appeal. In its decision, the BIA found it unnecessary to address the adverse credibility findings of the IJ and implicitly accepted that Mukamusoni was credible.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> It nonetheless found Mukamusoni \"failed to meet her burden of proof in establishing past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution.\" Even though the BIA proceeded on the assumption that Mukamusoni was credible, it found her testimony to be \"vague regarding key elements of her asylum claim\" and \"scant and generalized.\" For example, the BIA found it significant that Mukamusoni \"testified that she was raped during her incarcerations, but provided no details about the incidents.\" It discussed Dr. Wolfe's psychological evaluation only in the sense of holding it against Mukamusoni because she did not continue to appear for treatment. The BIA also found that Mukamusoni did not provide sufficient corroborating evidence to support her claim, and that such corroboration was necessary because her testimony was not \"sufficiently detailed.\" Finally, the BIA determined that Mukamusoni's decision to return to school in Rwanda after her first arrest and to return to Rwanda on two occasions to retrieve her college transcripts undercut the genuineness of her subjective fear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 20, 2003, Mukamusoni timely petitioned this court for review of the BIA's decision to affirm the IJ's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the BIA's decision, as the final agency order, that we review. <i>See Georcely v. Ashcroft,</i> 375 F.3d 45, 49 (1st Cir.2004); <i>Albathani v. INS,</i> 318 F.3d 365, 373 (1st Cir.2003). We review the BIA's determination that Mukamusoni failed to meet her burden of proof under the deferential substantial evidence standard. <i>INS v.

Our review is on the whole record, not solely on the evidence that supports the BIA's determination. <i>Gailius v. INS,</i> 147 F.3d 34, 44 (1st Cir.1998). \"[D]eference is not due [to the BIA] where findings and conclusions are based on inferences or presumptions that are not reasonably grounded in the record, viewed as a whole, or are merely personal views of the immigration judge.\" <i>Cordero-Trejo v.

NLRB,</i> 340 U.S. 474, 488, 71 S.Ct. 456, 95 L.Ed. 456 (1951)) (alteration omitted). The BIA's legal conclusions are reviewed <i>de novo,</i>\"with appropriate deference to the agency's interpretation of the underlying statute in accordance with administrative law principles.\" <i>Id.</i> at 43.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An asylum applicant bears the burden of proving that he or she is \"unable or unwilling to return to [the applicant's country of nationality] ... because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion.\" 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.13(a). Applicants may meet this burden in one of two ways: 1) by demonstrating a well-founded fear of persecution on account of one of the statutory grounds, or 2) by establishing past persecution on account of one of the statutory grounds so as to be entitled to a presumption of a well-founded fear of persecution. <i>Mihaylov v.

The BIA committed errors of law and misapplied the law by focusing narrowly on only parts of the record that supported its decision, by raising too high the bar for an asylum claimant seeking to prove past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, by unreasonably evaluating the record, and by excessively demanding corroborative evidence. We explain these errors below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">If the BIA had squarely found her credible, then on this record, it is very likely that we would have been compelled to conclude that Mukamusoni had established past persecution with respect to her testimony of the events in Rwanda.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a> <i>See, e.g., Knezevic v. Ashcroft,</i> 367 F.3d 1206, 1212 (9th Cir.2004) (reversing BIA's finding that there was no past persecution and holding that record compels conclusion that asylum applicants suffered past persecution); <i>Bellido v. Ashcroft,</i> 367 F.3d 840, 846 (8th Cir.2004) (same). In that event, she would have been entitled to a regulatory presumption of having met her burden of proof with respect to fear of future persecution, and we would remand for further proceedings on the basis that she had met that burden. However, since the BIA declined to reach the adverse credibility findings of the IJ but assumed credibility, we vacate the BIA's order and remand for further proceedings in light of this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The record and Mukamusoni's burden of proof</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Because the BIA \"d[id] not find it necessary to address [Mukamusoni's] credibility\" and solely evaluated the sufficiency of the evidence to meet Mukamusoni's burden of proof, the BIA treated her testimony and her supporting documentation as credible. That is also the position the government has taken in this court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA nonetheless affirmed the IJ's denial of asylum because it found that Mukamusoni \"ha[d] not presented sufficient detail so as to provide a plausible and coherent account of the events underlying her claim\" and \"failed to meet her burden of proof in establishing past persecution.\" To support this conclusion, the BIA explained that \"[w]hile [Mukamusoni]'s affidavit was replete with information, her testimony was scant and generalized.\" Then, while citing and purporting to follow the analysis in <i>Matter of Y-B-,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. 1136 (BIA 1998), the BIA focused exclusively on Mukamusoni's oral testimony. The BIA painted Mukamusoni's oral testimony regarding the circumstances of her two arrests, incarceration, and release as \"general,\" \"devoid of information,\" and \"vague[ ].\" In particular, the BIA pointed to the fact that Mukamusoni provided \"no details\" about her rapes. The BIA concluded that Mukamusoni, like the applicant in <i>Matter of Y-B-,</i> \"did not offer critical details in her testimony to furnish context to her claim for asylum.\" <i>See Matter of Y-B-,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 1137-38. The record does not support any of these conclusions.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's focus on only the oral evidence was error in two ways. First, as a matter of fact, Mukamusoni had been encouraged to keep her oral testimony short because her extensive affidavit was accepted as the bulk of her testimony; and so the affidavit could not be discounted. Further, as a matter of law, under INS rules, that affidavit testimony could not be discounted to the extent the BIA chose to do. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.3(c)(1) (\"[I]nformation provided in the [asylum] application may be used ... to satisfy any burden of proof in ... removal proceedings.\"). In doing so the BIA committed an error of law.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA also erred in applying its own precedents. Nothing in <i>Matter of Y-B-</i> supports the BIA's reasoning. In <i>Matter of Y-B-,</i> the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision to deny a Mauritanian man's claim for asylum on the ground that the alien failed to meet his burden of proof to establish eligibility for asylum. 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 1136-39. The BIA relied on the fact that the alien's application for asylum \"[did] not provide <i>additional</i> information regarding his claim. Rather, there [were] significant omissions [of references to events he orally testified to] in the written application.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1138 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to <i>Matter of Y-B-,</i> the written affidavit of Mukamusoni in support of her asylum application is \"replete with information.\" Every single item that the BIA found lacking sufficient detail in Mukamusoni's oral testimony is supplemented by additional detail in her written answers to the asylum application and the affidavit in support of her application. For example, the BIA faulted Mukamusoni for giving only \"general\" oral testimony about the \"date or location\" of her arrests, the manner of her arrests, and details concerning her incarceration, interrogation, and release. Yet, all of these details are found in her affidavit and written answers on the asylum application, which are part of the record before the BIA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The BIA identified no instance where she testified to significant events that are omitted in the written application and affidavit. Thus, the analysis in <i>Matter of Y-B-</i> does not support the BIA's conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's failure to take into account the evidence in Mukamusoni's application and affidavit is contrary to law and particularly egregious in light of the IJ's limitation of oral testimony. We also note that the government did not object to the admission of the affidavit information into evidence and had ample opportunity throughout the proceedings to cross examine her on the details in the affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Lack of corroboration</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA also found that Mukamusoni \"did not provide sufficient corroborating evidence to support her claim.\" This finding is likewise not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, the BIA's finding of lack of corroborative evidence is linked to its error in not reviewing the entire record, as noted above. This is so because \"corroborative evidence is not required to establish an asylum claim; in many cases, the applicant's own credible testimony is sufficient to support eligibility for asylum as long as it provides a basis for a well founded fear.\" <i>Gailius,</i> 147 F.3d at 45; <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.13(a). The BIA has also held that \"the weaker an alien's testimony [is], the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\" <i>Matter of Y-B-,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 1139. Because the BIA failed to consider the entire record and found Mukamusoni's testimony weaker than it actually was, it demanded a higher level of corroboration than it should have. The \"combination of detailed testimony and corroborative background evidence\" is sufficient to establish Mukamusoni's past persecution. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the record does not support the BIA's conclusion that Mukamusoni insufficiently corroborated her testimony. The BIA ignored the presence of the bulk of the corroborative evidence in the record and overstated the role of the absence of certain pieces of corroborative evidence. In support of her application for asylum, Mukamusoni offered corroborative evidence in the form of medical records, country condition reports, proof of the loss of certain documents from Northwest Airlines, and identification documents. In addition, Mukamusoni offered to provide an affidavit explaining why she could not obtain a copy of her father's death certificate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the overwhelming weight of the evidence from the twenty-five pages of Dr. Wolfe's notes and Dr. Wolfe's psychological evaluation corroborates Mukamusoni's claims. The records are literally replete with information which supports the substance of Mukamusoni's testimony. Mukamusoni's account of her experiences in Rwanda to Dr. Wolfe is also consistent with the accounts given in her affidavit, application, and oral testimony. Dr. Wolfe noted the physical evidence that corroborated Mukamusoni's story: ulcers developed in prison, her independently sought HIV testing in light of her fear of having contracted AIDS from her rapes, trauma-induced PTSD symptoms such as nightmares, hopelessness, sleeplessness, distrust of others, etc.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA, however, found that the medical records Mukamusoni submitted to bolster her claim actually \"undercut[ ] her claim\" that she suffers from PTSD because the records show that Mukamusoni \"was not sincere in her attempts to seek medical assistance.\" The BIA based this conclusion on the following handwritten note from Dr. Wolfe: \"[Although enthusiastic and compliant,] [Mukamusoni] was not reliable in coming to therapy and, after 2 sessions beyond the asylum eval. indicated that she did not have time to come. She recontacted me in early March 2000 because her final trial was coming up soon.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Even if the BIA were correct that this indicated Mukamusoni's lack of dedication in seeking medical treatment, it is not clear how this would \"undercut her claim\" with respect to her PTSD condition. The medical records were submitted to corroborate the diagnosis of her treating psychologist and the strength of her fear, which are facts independent of her ability to keep appointments. To the extent that her \"sincerity\" in seeking treatment might be relevant to a general credibility determination, the BIA already chose not to address her credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's interpretation of the medical records is especially inexplicable because, within the very same note from which the BIA takes the quote above, Dr. Wolfe <i>reiterates</i> her diagnosis and recommends continued follow-up treatment for Mukamusoni with a new therapist, which would be a nonsensical conclusion if Dr. Wolfe thought Mukamusoni's PTSD to be fabricated. Viewed as a whole, the BIA's finding that the medical records \"undercut[ ]\" rather than corroborated Mukamusoni's claim is simply unsupportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA also cited the fact that \"[n]otwithstanding the long continuance, [Mukamusoni] did not present [Dr. Wolfe] as a witness, as she was unavailable\" as further example of lack of corroboration. This is not a fair or accurate characterization of the history of the proceedings before the IJ. The record shows that Mukamusoni made repeated offers to have Dr. Wolfe testify, first in person, and then telephonically, but was not allowed to do so by the IJ. The record also shows that the \"long continuance\" was <i>not</i> granted by the IJ in order to have Mukamusoni secure Dr. Wolfe's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are other pieces of corroborative evidence in the record that the BIA did not discuss and it is unclear whether the BIA even considered them: the letter from Northwest Airlines and lost luggage tracing claim forms confirming her lost luggage, her Ugandan passport, her Rwandan identity card, and her student identity card at Rwandan National University. Each of these documents provided corroboration for crucial parts of Mukamusoni's story. For example, the Ugandan passport corroborated her testimony as the IJ asked her about her flight between Uganda and Rwanda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA also made no mention of the background and country conditions evidence that Mukamusoni submitted into the record. In reviewing an applicant's claim of credible fear of persecution, current regulations state that \"the asylum officer may rely on material provided by the Department of State ... or other credible sources, such as international organizations, private voluntary agencies, news organizations, or academic institutions.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.12. Mukamusoni submitted into evidence the 1999 country conditions reports on Rwanda from Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the Department of State. Courts and the BIA routinely used such country condition reports to corroborate the testimony of asylum applicants under the old regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See El Moraghy,</i> 331 F.3d at 203-04 (country condition reports \"can either help or harm a petitioner's case, depending on whether or not they corroborate the petitioner's tale\"); <i>see also Cordero-Trejo,</i> 40 F.3d at 490-91 (incidents of politically, socially or religiously motivated persecution of non-prominent individuals in applicant's position in his country of nationality bolstered alien's claim). It was error for the BIA to have ignored the country condition reports because \"this failure [to evaluate the reports] unreasonably eviscerate[d] the applicant's attempt to establish the objective element of her asylum claim.\" <i>Cordero-Trejo,</i> 40 F.3d at 492.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such documentary evidence is \"extremely important for contextualizing, in the absence of direct corroboration, the events which [an applicant] claims constitute persecution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 491. Even a quick look at the country condition reports demonstrates that these reports support Mukamusoni's claims. <i>See Gailius,</i> 147 F.3d at 45 n. 6 (\"[A]n uncorroborated story that is at odds with what is known about country conditions is less likely to be accurate than one that is consistent with country conditions.\"). For example, the country reports corroborate Mukamusoni's account of persons in her father's position joining the Hutu rebels in Zaire and their subsequent deaths in the Kibeho camp. In addition, the 1999 Human Rights Watch Report for Rwanda contains descriptions of the practices of arbitrary detentions, prison abuses, and military-civilian security sweeps carried out by the RPF government which corroborate Mukamusoni's testimony of her experiences in Rwanda: \"The government, citing the need for self-defense against the insurgency, organized civilians to monitor purportedly anti-government activity....\" \"Military, police, and some civilian officials took thousands of persons into custody during large-scale security sweeps, residential inspections, and verification of identify papers on the roads. Some of these persons were subsequently released after interrogation that was sometimes accompanied by physical abuse.\" The BIA unreasonably ignored these reports, and gave no explanation for why it did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only did the BIA err in not adequately considering the medical records and country condition reports as corroborative of Mukamusoni's testimony, it also overstated the role of the absence of certain pieces of corroborative evidence. The BIA placed unreasonable weight on the absence of a letter from Mukamusoni's friend Fi Fi corroborating Mukamusoni's claims. Mukamusoni originally indicated to the IJ at the April 27, 2000 hearing that she could obtain such a letter. At the January 24, 2001 hearing, neither the IJ nor the parties brought up the letter and it is unclear why (it appears that the IJ may not have included the request for the letter in his notes of the previous hearing). Mukamusoni did not offer an explanation for this absence before the IJ and has not offered one on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> It is true that the absence of this letter and any explanation for why it could not be obtained, when Mukamusoni indicated that it would be available, could tend to support the BIA's finding that Mukamusoni did not produce sufficient corroboration. However, the absence of this one letter is insufficient to justify disregarding the corroborative evidence that Mukamusoni <i>did</i> provide. On this record, the BIA's finding that Mukamusoni failed to introduce sufficient corroborative evidence for her asylum claim is not supported by substantial evidence. <i>See Albathani,</i> 318 F.3d at 372.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Mukamusoni's subjective fear</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the BIA questioned the \"genuineness\" of Mukamusoni's \"subjective fear of persecution\" in Rwanda because of her \"decision to remain at the school after two arrests and to return to Rwanda on two occasions after the Rwandan government was searching for her.\" This conclusion is again not supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the conclusion is in error as a matter of law because we find Mukamusoni, if credible, has met her burden of proof with respect to past persecution in Rwanda, and thus the BIA erred as a matter of law by denying her the benefit of the regulatory presumption under 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.13(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the BIA's doubts of the \"genuineness\" of Mukamusoni's subjective fear are contrary to the BIA's decision not to address her credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the BIA also does not consider the evidence outlined above. In the context of that evidence, the BIA's assessment does not take into account the reasonable explanations Mukamusoni offered for her decisions to remain at school in Rwanda after her first year and to return to Rwanda to obtain her transcripts despite the danger of being arrested again. Mukamusoni specifically explained that after her first rape, she returned to St. Mary's and was fearful of returning to Rwanda. However, because the rape was so \"ashaming and embarrassing\" to her, she did not tell Sister Catherine about the rape. It is in these circumstances that Sister Catherine then urged her to return to Rwanda and continue her studies, allaying Mukamusoni's fears by assuring her that the RPF soldiers would not arrest her again now that her father was dead. Mukamusoni was a twenty-year old first-year college student at the time and Sister Catherine was her guiding light. The assurances by Sister Catherine, as events unfolded, turned out to be tragically overly optimistic. The decision to remain in a country in which the applicant was persecuted after release from prison does not necessarily undercut an applicant's claim for asylum, if adequately explained. <i>See, e.g., Turcios v. INS,</i> 821 F.2d 1396, 1401-02 (9th Cir.1987) (finding that it was unreasonable for the IJ to determine that the government of the alien's country of origin would not have persecuted him because the alien remained in that country for several months after his release from prison when he was under constant surveillance).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Mukamusoni testified that after the death of every member of her immediate family, she was without any means of economic or emotional support excepting the generosity of Sister Catherine. She testified in essence that there was literally nothing for her to do in Uganda or Rwanda; her only means of obtaining an education was at the National University of Rwanda, where Rwandans are entitled to education at the government's expense. A decision she made to go back to the only place where she could obtain a \"free\" education, at Sister Catherine's urging, is insufficient to show, against this record, that her fears of persecution in Rwanda were not genuine. Faced with no viable means of support otherwise, people take risks in the face of their fears. Mukamusoni's subsequent entries into Rwanda to obtain her transcripts were also motivated by both Sister Catherine's urging and Mukamusoni's desperate attempt to preserve the possibility of a better life through the hope of obtaining an education.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the record as a whole, including the evidence the BIA ignored and assuming Mukamusoni's credibility as did the BIA, we cannot conscientiously find that the evidence supporting the BIA's determination that Mukamusoni failed to meet her burden of proof is substantial. <i>See Universal Camera Corp.,</i> 340 U.S. at 488, 71 S.Ct. 456.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>IV.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p63\">\n      <span class=\"num\">63</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The order of the BIA is <i>vacated</i> and the case <i>remanded</i> for further proceedings not inconsistent with this opinion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In March 2003, the relevant functions of the INS were transferred into the new Department of Homeland Security and reorganized into the Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (BICE).

The BIA treated Mukamusoni's nationality as Rwandan for asylum purposes, and we will frame our review accordingly. \"`[A] reviewing court must judge the propriety of administrative action solely by the grounds invoked by the agency....' \"<i>Gailius,</i> 147 F.3d at 44 (quoting <i>SEC v.

Her mother was a Tutsi while her father was a Hutu, and she had six siblings. She had \"always considered [her]self Rwandese.\" Her father worked for a Ugandan family in Mbarara, Uganda, and that family told government officials that Mukamusoni was their daughter so that she could attend school in Uganda. Mukamusoni was thus able to attend St. Mary's, a Catholic boarding school, and lived with the nuns of St. Mary's at their convent in Uganda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mukamusoni's family lived in Uganda until 1993, when every member of the family except Mukamusoni returned to Rwanda. Mukamusoni explained that at that time, many Rwandans in Uganda decided to return to Rwanda in order to \"fight for their rights.\" The Rwandan migration was also partly due to Uganda's policy, which advocated the repatriation of Rwandan refugees to Rwanda. Mukamusoni herself stayed behind in Uganda to continue high school at St. Mary's.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1994, civil war broke out in Rwanda. According to the 1999 Human Rights Watch Report for Rwanda (which was admitted into evidence), in 1994 \"the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), composed largely of Tutsi refugees who had spent decades in exile, defeated the Rwandan government, made up primarily of Hutu, who form the great majority of the Rwandan population.... [T]he [Hutu-dominated] government and army carried out a genocide of more than half a million Tutsi until they were stopped by the RPF.\" After their defeat, members of the former government became leaders of the Hutu rebels, and \"[s]ome of the insurgents, including several senior officers who led the 1994 genocide, seemed ready to continue annihilating the Tutsi.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the genocide of the Tutsi in Rwanda, Mukamusoni's father was originally in the army of the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), but after some time he decided to desert the RPF and joined the Hutu rebels because he was Hutu himself. Mukamusoni's eldest brother joined her father with the Hutu rebel forces during the war, and he was killed in Kigali, Rwanda in 1994. Mukamusoni's other siblings and her mother lived in a refugee camp at Mutara, Rwanda during this time. Mukamusoni said that even though a Hutu law required \"a Hutu man married to a Tutsi woman to kill his wife,\" Mukamusoni's father refused to kill his wife because he was in love with her. But later, a Hutu death squad came to the refugee camp and slaughtered Mukamusoni's mother and her remaining siblings, along with many other refugees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Through most of the genocide, Mukamusoni was in Uganda. She returned to Rwanda in 1995, when the civil war in Rwanda slowed down, to take the university entrance exams and to be with her family. While in Rwanda preparing for the exams, she received news of the massacre of her mother and siblings. Mukamusoni decided to attend the funeral for her mother, siblings, and other victims of the massacre, even though it was very dangerous for her because of her Hutu heritage and the fact that most of the people there were Tutsi. Mukamusoni testified that at the funeral there were \"[s]o many people\" dead and the bodies were \"cut in pieces\" and \"mixed up\" and buried in the same grave yard, such that one \"couldn't tell who is who.\" In fact, Mukamusoni was unable to identify the remains of her youngest sibling.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the funeral, she also saw her father, who could not stay long because the Tutsi in the RPF were looking for him. (By then the RPF was in control of the government of Rwanda.) He told her that he was leaving Rwanda for Zaire (now Congo) with the other Hutu rebels. According to the 1999 Human Rights Watch Report for Rwanda, after the RPF victory, the Hutu rebels led \"some two million Rwandans into exile, more than half of them to Zaire.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mukamusoni began her studies at the National University of Rwanda in Butare, Rwanda in May 1996. She introduced into evidence a copy of her Rwandan identity card and a copy of her student identity card at the National University of Rwanda. The RPF government posted soldiers, most of whom were Tutsi, at the entrances of the University in order to prevent a repeat of the Hutu rebels' massacre of the students, which had occurred in 1994 during the genocide. The soldiers and other students began to harass Mukamusoni because she was using her father's last name, Mukarazizi, which they recognized as the name of a known Hutu rebel. Mukamusoni studied journalism and was an outspoken proponent of ethnic reconciliation between the Hutu and the Tutsi. In response, the Tutsi soldiers and their student affiliates banned her from publishing letters in the school newspaper and told other students not to listen to her. She received letters from her father from time to time informing her that he was alive, but these letters were interpreted by the RPF soldiers as evidence of her espionage with a Hutu rebel. As a result, she was \"pulled from class\" and questioned by the soldiers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the end of her first semester, Mukamusoni was again taken from class to the RPF office, where her student ID and Rwandan passport were taken from her so that she could not travel and leave Rwanda. The soldiers interrogated her about her correspondence with her father and his whereabouts; although she showed them her father's letters and explained that she knew nothing about the plans of the rebels, the soldiers did not believe her and thought she was lying. She was arrested and taken to prison in Butare, Rwanda, where she was imprisoned for four months. During this time she was beaten every morning, interrogated twice per week, and tortured by various kinds of forced activity: rolling in dry grass in the mornings as a form of \"wake up\"; walking \"miles and miles\" to exhaustion; digging ditches; digging through giant anthills in hot weather to retrieve the queen ant while being beaten until she passed out; and doing other kinds of manual labor. Within the first week of her imprisonment she was raped by a Tutsi soldier at the prison. This was her first experience of sexual intercourse, and she was terrified that she would contract AIDS or become pregnant from the rape. During her imprisonment, she \"wished for death\" and \"had no hope for the future.\" But, to her surprise, she was released when the RPF government realized that she had no information about her father. Her passport was returned to her, and she finished her first year at the University in 1997.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, after her release from prison, she received a letter from someone claiming to be a friend of her father's informing her that her father had been killed by the Tutsi in Kibeho, Zaire. Because the letter was from a Hutu rebel, it was not signed. From that point on, Mukamusoni received no further communications from her father.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">According to the 1999 Human Rights Watch Report for Rwanda, \"[i]n refugee camps [in Zaire], remnants of the defeated [rebel Hutu] army rearmed, recruited new forces, and began incursions into Rwanda. In 1996, [Tutsi] Rwandan troops ... dispers[ed] the camps, massacring tens of thousands of unarmed civilians, and killing thousands of soldiers and militia.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In her removal proceedings, the INS lawyer and the IJ both questioned Mukamusoni about whether she could present death certificates for her family. She testified that she \"never even heard about ... death certificates.... They don't give out death certificates in [Rwanda],\" especially not \"during the genocide.\" Nor did she know if they gave out death certificates in Zaire, where her father had died, as she had never been there.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mukamusoni spent the summer of 1997 back in Uganda at St. Mary's convent. She told Sister Catherine, a nun to whom she was very close, her fears of returning to Rwanda in light of her experiences there. However, Sister Catherine urged her to return to Rwanda to continue her studies. Because she had lost her entire family and had no means of economic support, Mukamusoni decided that she had to return to school in Rwanda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When Mukamusoni started her second year at the University in 1997 she changed her last name on the student ID from her father's name (Mukarazizi) to her own (Mukamusoni), in the hope that the RPF soldiers would stop harassing her. Mukamusoni explained that in Africa it was not necessary that children have the same last name as their parents. But, this name change did not work because a fellow student, Ndemezo, found out through Mukamusoni's classmates that she was Hutu and that her father was a Hutu rebel. Ndemezo, a Tutsi, targeted Mukamusoni for harassment because he felt that she helped to kill his family and reported her to his brother, who was a soldier in the RPF. Ndemezo stole Mukamusoni's Ugandan passport. Later in the year, Mukamusoni was again arrested by the RPF and, this time, she spent two months in prison. She was beaten, forced to do manual labor, and raped by a different Tutsi soldier. The RPF again interrogated her concerning her father and her travels to Uganda, believing that she was receiving information from Hutu rebels. She gave the soldiers all the information they sought, including the address of St. Mary's convent in Uganda. Although she showed the soldiers the letter containing news of her father's death, the RPF continued to believe that her father was alive. The soldiers finally released her after she threatened to kill herself. After she was released, she was punished each day with manual labor tasks that took all day such as farming and cleaning university facilities, such that it was nearly impossible for her to attend class.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">After a few weeks of trying to do manual labor and to attend class, Mukamusoni escaped to St. Mary's convent in Uganda. There she was confronted on several occasions by Ugandan and RPF soldiers. Mukamusoni explained that Ugandan soldiers worked with the RPF because Uganda had supported the Tutsi during the civil war. One of Mukamusoni's friends, Fi Fi, informed Sister Catherine that RPF soldiers were planning to arrest Mukamusoni in Uganda. Sister Catherine then took Mukamusoni to a remote village where she could hide while Sister Catherine obtained on Mukamusoni's behalf a Ugandan passport, a tourist visa to the United States, and a plane ticket.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Sister Catherine believed that Mukamusoni should go back to Rwanda to get her college transcripts so that she could continue her studies in the United States. Although Mukamusoni pled with Sister Catherine and explained to Sister Catherine that such a trip would be very dangerous, Sister Catherine insisted that it was very important. At Sister Catherine's urging, Mukamusoni returned to Rwanda on February 17, 1998, to obtain her transcripts. She heard from Fi Fi that the RPF was planning to arrest her, and she immediately fled back to Uganda ten days later, without her transcripts. Upon her return, she stayed for a short time at the convent before going back to the remote village to hide. While she was at the convent soldiers hid outside the convent, waiting to interrogate her. Mukamusoni also returned to Rwanda one more time in another aborted attempt to get her transcripts, staying for only a few days this time because she again heard that the RPF planned to arrest her. Mukamusoni introduced into evidence a copy of her Ugandan passport.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mukamusoni returned to the convent at the end of April 1998 to get her plane ticket, and Sister Catherine died of cancer shortly after that. Mukamusoni left Uganda and entered the United States at Houston, Texas, on May 5, 1998 with a six-month visitor's visa. Her luggage was lost by the airline. Many of her personal documents, such as her Rwandan passport and the letter informing her of her father's death, were lost along with the luggage. Mukamusoni introduced into evidence an apology letter from Northwest Airlines and the lost luggage tracing claim forms.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mukamusoni moved to Waltham, Massachusetts, where she lived with a distant relative and worked as a babysitter. On May 10, 1999, she applied for asylum in the United States, a few days more than one year after she entered the United States.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In August of 1999, Dr. Rachel Wolfe, a psychologist of the Cambridge Health Alliance, began to evaluate Mukamusoni, upon referral by Mukamusoni's counsel. Dr. Wolfe conducted three clinical interviews with Mukamusoni and recorded her findings in a psychological evaluation completed on October 1, 1999. This evaluation and a set of notes maintained by Dr. Wolfe during the time she saw Mukamusoni were submitted into evidence. Dr. Wolfe found Mukamusoni to be a \"reliable historian\" whose \"account of her experience was consistent across interviews.\" Dr. Wolfe wrote that Mukamusoni suffered from ulcers \"developed in prison,\" and that she sought HIV testing to be sure that she did not have AIDS. Dr. Wolfe reported that every night, Mukamusoni experienced nightmares of her tortures in prison and the killings of her family, waking to the \"sound of her own screams or to a pillow wet with her tears.\" She wrote that Mukamusoni \"fe[lt] flooded with terror,\" \"experienc[ed] overwhelming grief ... and feelings of helplessness and hopelessness,\" \"felt cut off from people,\" and had little control over her crying spells. Dr. Wolfe described Mukamusoni as having a restricted range of emotion, which she said is typical of trauma victims, and that Mukamusoni had a \"sense of foreshortened future\" where she did not \"expect to live long.\" Dr. Wolfe also wrote that Mukamusoni had difficulty falling and remaining asleep at night, \"unable to get thoughts of her family and fears of what will happen to her out of her mind.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Based on Mukamusoni's symptoms, Dr. Wolfe diagnosed her with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Beyond the diagnosis of PTSD, Dr. Wolfe reported that Mukamusoni's behavior during her interviews (including low voice and low level of energy) was typical of individuals experiencing a \"Major Depressive Disorder\" under the definition of the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. Dr. Wolfe recommended that Mukamusoni receive \"individual psychotherapy and psychopharmacology,\" and \"antidepressant medication for her post-traumatic and depressive symptoms.\" Mukamusoni began to receive psychotherapy from Dr. Wolfe, and she was also given Prozac. Dr. Wolfe noted that Mukamusoni \"appear [ed] to have the drive and intelligence to create a productive life for herself in the United States.\" Dr. Wolfe noted that Mukamusoni was \"enthusiastic and compliant\" in treatment, but was not reliable in making her appointments. After a few more sessions, Mukamusoni did not continue to see Dr. Wolfe for treatment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The INS rejected Mukamusoni's application on October 15, 1999, because she missed the one-year filing deadline. <i>See</i> 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1158(a)(2)(B); 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.4(a). On October 27, 1999, the INS issued a Notice to Appear, charging her with removability as an alien who remained in the United States longer than permitted.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>II.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Removal proceedings for Mukamusoni commenced before an IJ on January 12, 2000; Mukamusoni conceded removability and relied on her application for asylum, withholding of removal, protection under the CAT, and voluntary departure. A merits hearing was held on April 27, 2000, and continued on January 24, 2001.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">During the April 27, 2000 hearing, the IJ excused Mukamusoni's late filing of her asylum application because the IJ found her to be suffering from PTSD during the year that she was in the United States, and that this constituted \"extraordinary circumstances\" justifying the late filing. No dispute remains as to the timeliness of her filing.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mukamusoni testified to the events in her application and affidavit as recounted above. She testified that she was afraid to go back either to Uganda or Rwanda for fear that she would be tortured due to her Hutu ethnicity and the political activities of her father. She testified that she had heard from her friend Fi Fi that soldiers still went by St. Mary's to ask the nuns about Mukamusoni's whereabouts.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Mukamusoni offered to have Dr. Wolfe testify at the original hearing on April 27, 2000, but was told by the IJ to wait for a later date as the IJ wanted to hear Mukamusoni's testimony first. Mukamusoni again offered to have Dr. Wolfe testify by telephone at the January 24, 2001 hearing, but the IJ denied that request as well on the ground that the witness was available. Dr. Wolfe, however, was not available to appear for the later date and so did not testify.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At the April 27, 2000 hearing, the IJ granted a continuance to January 24, 2001 in part to allow Mukamusoni to obtain additional documentation, including a death certificate for her father, medical records, and a letter from her friend Fi Fi. At the later date, Mukamusoni submitted her medical records into evidence. The government objected on the ground that Dr. Wolfe, the maker of the records, was not available to be cross-examined. The IJ nonetheless made the records part of the record, agreeing to consider them <i>de bene</i> in light of the objection. The IJ also denied Mukamusoni's attempt to introduce an affidavit documenting the (ultimately unsuccessful) attempts to secure a death certificate for her father.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ finally denied Mukamusoni's application for asylum \"as a matter of discretion\" in an oral decision dated January 24, 2001. The IJ also denied the applications for withholding of removal and CAT protection but granted her voluntary departure.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The IJ found that Mukamusoni \"has not established the truthfulness of what is stated in her asylum application, documentation in support thereof, and her testimony in these proceedings.\" That was because, in the IJ's view, \"[a] reasonable person, similarly situated as [Mukamusoni] on this record would not fear persecution or have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of [one of the five statutory grounds listed in 8 U.S.C. &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A)].\" The IJ found that Mukamusoni's testimony was \"self-serving\" and \"[left] a lot to the imagination\" and determined that she gave \"no evidence\" and \"no corroboration\" concerning her experiences.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On appeal to the BIA, Mukamusoni argued that the IJ had failed to give her the benefit of the regulatory presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution for establishing past persecution. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.13(b)(1). She also argued that the IJ misapplied the \"reasonable person\" test set out in <i>Matter of Mogharrabi,</i> 19 I. &amp; N.

The BIA also found that Mukamusoni did not provide sufficient corroborating evidence to support her claim, and that such corroboration was necessary because her testimony was not \"sufficiently detailed.\" Finally, the BIA determined that Mukamusoni's decision to return to school in Rwanda after her first arrest and to return to Rwanda on two occasions to retrieve her college transcripts undercut the genuineness of her subjective fear.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On May 20, 2003, Mukamusoni timely petitioned this court for review of the BIA's decision to affirm the IJ's decision.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>III.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is the BIA's decision, as the final agency order, that we review. <i>See Georcely v.

The BIA committed errors of law and misapplied the law by focusing narrowly on only parts of the record that supported its decision, by raising too high the bar for an asylum claimant seeking to prove past persecution or a well-founded fear of future persecution, by unreasonably evaluating the record, and by excessively demanding corroborative evidence.

In that event, she would have been entitled to a regulatory presumption of having met her burden of proof with respect to fear of future persecution, and we would remand for further proceedings on the basis that she had met that burden.

Dec. 1136 (BIA 1998), the BIA focused exclusively on Mukamusoni's oral testimony. The BIA painted Mukamusoni's oral testimony regarding the circumstances of her two arrests, incarceration, and release as \"general,\" \"devoid of information,\" and \"vague[ ].\" In particular, the BIA pointed to the fact that Mukamusoni provided \"no details\" about her rapes. The BIA concluded that Mukamusoni, like the applicant in <i>Matter of Y-B-,</i> \"did not offer critical details in her testimony to furnish context to her claim for asylum.\" <i>See Matter of Y-B-,</i> 21 I. &amp; N.

First, as a matter of fact, Mukamusoni had been encouraged to keep her oral testimony short because her extensive affidavit was accepted as the bulk of her testimony; and so the affidavit could not be discounted. Further, as a matter of law, under INS rules, that affidavit testimony could not be discounted to the extent the BIA chose to do. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.3(c)(1) (\"[I]nformation provided in the [asylum] application may be used ... to satisfy any burden of proof in ... removal proceedings.\").

Nothing in <i>Matter of Y-B-</i> supports the BIA's reasoning. In <i>Matter of Y-B-,</i> the BIA affirmed the IJ's decision to deny a Mauritanian man's claim for asylum on the ground that the alien failed to meet his burden of proof to establish eligibility for asylum. 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 1136-39. The BIA relied on the fact that the alien's application for asylum \"[did] not provide <i>additional</i> information regarding his claim. Rather, there [were] significant omissions [of references to events he orally testified to] in the written application.\" <i>Id.</i> at 1138 (emphasis added).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In contrast to <i>Matter of Y-B-,</i> the written affidavit of Mukamusoni in support of her asylum application is \"replete with information.\" Every single item that the BIA found lacking sufficient detail in Mukamusoni's oral testimony is supplemented by additional detail in her written answers to the asylum application and the affidavit in support of her application. For example, the BIA faulted Mukamusoni for giving only \"general\" oral testimony about the \"date or location\" of her arrests, the manner of her arrests, and details concerning her incarceration, interrogation, and release. Yet, all of these details are found in her affidavit and written answers on the asylum application, which are part of the record before the BIA.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The BIA identified no instance where she testified to significant events that are omitted in the written application and affidavit. Thus, the analysis in <i>Matter of Y-B-</i> does not support the BIA's conclusion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's failure to take into account the evidence in Mukamusoni's application and affidavit is contrary to law and particularly egregious in light of the IJ's limitation of oral testimony. We also note that the government did not object to the admission of the affidavit information into evidence and had ample opportunity throughout the proceedings to cross examine her on the details in the affidavit.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Lack of corroboration</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA also found that Mukamusoni \"did not provide sufficient corroborating evidence to support her claim.\" This finding is likewise not supported by substantial evidence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Initially, the BIA's finding of lack of corroborative evidence is linked to its error in not reviewing the entire record, as noted above. This is so because \"corroborative evidence is not required to establish an asylum claim; in many cases, the applicant's own credible testimony is sufficient to support eligibility for asylum as long as it provides a basis for a well founded fear.\" <i>Gailius,</i> 147 F.3d at 45; <i>see also</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.13(a). The BIA has also held that \"the weaker an alien's testimony [is], the greater the need for corroborative evidence.\" <i>Matter of Y-B-,</i> 21 I. &amp; N. Dec. at 1139. Because the BIA failed to consider the entire record and found Mukamusoni's testimony weaker than it actually was, it demanded a higher level of corroboration than it should have. The \"combination of detailed testimony and corroborative background evidence\" is sufficient to establish Mukamusoni's past persecution. <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In any event, the record does not support the BIA's conclusion that Mukamusoni insufficiently corroborated her testimony. The BIA ignored the presence of the bulk of the corroborative evidence in the record and overstated the role of the absence of certain pieces of corroborative evidence. In support of her application for asylum, Mukamusoni offered corroborative evidence in the form of medical records, country condition reports, proof of the loss of certain documents from Northwest Airlines, and identification documents. In addition, Mukamusoni offered to provide an affidavit explaining why she could not obtain a copy of her father's death certificate.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the overwhelming weight of the evidence from the twenty-five pages of Dr. Wolfe's notes and Dr. Wolfe's psychological evaluation corroborates Mukamusoni's claims. The records are literally replete with information which supports the substance of Mukamusoni's testimony. Mukamusoni's account of her experiences in Rwanda to Dr. Wolfe is also consistent with the accounts given in her affidavit, application, and oral testimony. Dr. Wolfe noted the physical evidence that corroborated Mukamusoni's story: ulcers developed in prison, her independently sought HIV testing in light of her fear of having contracted AIDS from her rapes, trauma-induced PTSD symptoms such as nightmares, hopelessness, sleeplessness, distrust of others, etc.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fn6_ref\">6</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA, however, found that the medical records Mukamusoni submitted to bolster her claim actually \"undercut[ ] her claim\" that she suffers from PTSD because the records show that Mukamusoni \"was not sincere in her attempts to seek medical assistance.\" The BIA based this conclusion on the following handwritten note from Dr. Wolfe: \"[Although enthusiastic and compliant,] [Mukamusoni] was not reliable in coming to therapy and, after 2 sessions beyond the asylum eval. indicated that she did not have time to come. She recontacted me in early March 2000 because her final trial was coming up soon.\"<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn7\" id=\"fn7_ref\">7</a> Even if the BIA were correct that this indicated Mukamusoni's lack of dedication in seeking medical treatment, it is not clear how this would \"undercut her claim\" with respect to her PTSD condition. The medical records were submitted to corroborate the diagnosis of her treating psychologist and the strength of her fear, which are facts independent of her ability to keep appointments. To the extent that her \"sincerity\" in seeking treatment might be relevant to a general credibility determination, the BIA already chose not to address her credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA's interpretation of the medical records is especially inexplicable because, within the very same note from which the BIA takes the quote above, Dr. Wolfe <i>reiterates</i> her diagnosis and recommends continued follow-up treatment for Mukamusoni with a new therapist, which would be a nonsensical conclusion if Dr. Wolfe thought Mukamusoni's PTSD to be fabricated. Viewed as a whole, the BIA's finding that the medical records \"undercut[ ]\" rather than corroborated Mukamusoni's claim is simply unsupportable.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA also cited the fact that \"[n]otwithstanding the long continuance, [Mukamusoni] did not present [Dr. Wolfe] as a witness, as she was unavailable\" as further example of lack of corroboration. This is not a fair or accurate characterization of the history of the proceedings before the IJ. The record shows that Mukamusoni made repeated offers to have Dr. Wolfe testify, first in person, and then telephonically, but was not allowed to do so by the IJ. The record also shows that the \"long continuance\" was <i>not</i> granted by the IJ in order to have Mukamusoni secure Dr. Wolfe's testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">There are other pieces of corroborative evidence in the record that the BIA did not discuss and it is unclear whether the BIA even considered them: the letter from Northwest Airlines and lost luggage tracing claim forms confirming her lost luggage, her Ugandan passport, her Rwandan identity card, and her student identity card at Rwandan National University. Each of these documents provided corroboration for crucial parts of Mukamusoni's story. For example, the Ugandan passport corroborated her testimony as the IJ asked her about her flight between Uganda and Rwanda.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The BIA also made no mention of the background and country conditions evidence that Mukamusoni submitted into the record. In reviewing an applicant's claim of credible fear of persecution, current regulations state that \"the asylum officer may rely on material provided by the Department of State ... or other credible sources, such as international organizations, private voluntary agencies, news organizations, or academic institutions.\" 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.12. Mukamusoni submitted into evidence the 1999 country conditions reports on Rwanda from Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International, and the Department of State. Courts and the BIA routinely used such country condition reports to corroborate the testimony of asylum applicants under the old regulations.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn8\" id=\"fn8_ref\">8</a> <i>See El Moraghy,</i> 331 F.3d at 203-04 (country condition reports \"can either help or harm a petitioner's case, depending on whether or not they corroborate the petitioner's tale\"); <i>see also Cordero-Trejo,</i> 40 F.3d at 490-91 (incidents of politically, socially or religiously motivated persecution of non-prominent individuals in applicant's position in his country of nationality bolstered alien's claim). It was error for the BIA to have ignored the country condition reports because \"this failure [to evaluate the reports] unreasonably eviscerate[d] the applicant's attempt to establish the objective element of her asylum claim.\" <i>Cordero-Trejo,</i> 40 F.3d at 492.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Such documentary evidence is \"extremely important for contextualizing, in the absence of direct corroboration, the events which [an applicant] claims constitute persecution.\" <i>Id.</i> at 491. Even a quick look at the country condition reports demonstrates that these reports support Mukamusoni's claims. <i>See Gailius,</i> 147 F.3d at 45 n. 6 (\"[A]n uncorroborated story that is at odds with what is known about country conditions is less likely to be accurate than one that is consistent with country conditions.\"). For example, the country reports corroborate Mukamusoni's account of persons in her father's position joining the Hutu rebels in Zaire and their subsequent deaths in the Kibeho camp. In addition, the 1999 Human Rights Watch Report for Rwanda contains descriptions of the practices of arbitrary detentions, prison abuses, and military-civilian security sweeps carried out by the RPF government which corroborate Mukamusoni's testimony of her experiences in Rwanda: \"The government, citing the need for self-defense against the insurgency, organized civilians to monitor purportedly anti-government activity....\" \"Military, police, and some civilian officials took thousands of persons into custody during large-scale security sweeps, residential inspections, and verification of identify papers on the roads. Some of these persons were subsequently released after interrogation that was sometimes accompanied by physical abuse.\" The BIA unreasonably ignored these reports, and gave no explanation for why it did so.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Not only did the BIA err in not adequately considering the medical records and country condition reports as corroborative of Mukamusoni's testimony, it also overstated the role of the absence of certain pieces of corroborative evidence. The BIA placed unreasonable weight on the absence of a letter from Mukamusoni's friend Fi Fi corroborating Mukamusoni's claims. Mukamusoni originally indicated to the IJ at the April 27, 2000 hearing that she could obtain such a letter. At the January 24, 2001 hearing, neither the IJ nor the parties brought up the letter and it is unclear why (it appears that the IJ may not have included the request for the letter in his notes of the previous hearing). Mukamusoni did not offer an explanation for this absence before the IJ and has not offered one on appeal.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn9\" id=\"fn9_ref\">9</a> It is true that the absence of this letter and any explanation for why it could not be obtained, when Mukamusoni indicated that it would be available, could tend to support the BIA's finding that Mukamusoni did not produce sufficient corroboration. However, the absence of this one letter is insufficient to justify disregarding the corroborative evidence that Mukamusoni <i>did</i> provide. On this record, the BIA's finding that Mukamusoni failed to introduce sufficient corroborative evidence for her asylum claim is not supported by substantial evidence. <i>See Albathani,</i> 318 F.3d at 372.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">\n      <i>Mukamusoni's subjective fear</i>\n    </p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, the BIA questioned the \"genuineness\" of Mukamusoni's \"subjective fear of persecution\" in Rwanda because of her \"decision to remain at the school after two arrests and to return to Rwanda on two occasions after the Rwandan government was searching for her.\" This conclusion is again not supported by substantial evidence in the record.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the conclusion is in error as a matter of law because we find Mukamusoni, if credible, has met her burden of proof with respect to past persecution in Rwanda, and thus the BIA erred as a matter of law by denying her the benefit of the regulatory presumption under 8 C.F.R. &#167; 1208.13(b)(1).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Second, the BIA's doubts of the \"genuineness\" of Mukamusoni's subjective fear are contrary to the BIA's decision not to address her credibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Third, the BIA also does not consider the evidence outlined above. In the context of that evidence, the BIA's assessment does not take into account the reasonable explanations Mukamusoni offered for her decisions to remain at school in Rwanda after her first year and to return to Rwanda to obtain her transcripts despite the danger of being arrested again. Mukamusoni specifically explained that after her first rape, she returned to St. Mary's and was fearful of returning to Rwanda. However, because the rape was so \"ashaming and embarrassing\" to her, she did not tell Sister Catherine about the rape. It is in these circumstances that Sister Catherine then urged her to return to Rwanda and continue her studies, allaying Mukamusoni's fears by assuring her that the RPF soldiers would not arrest her again now that her father was dead. Mukamusoni was a twenty-year old first-year college student at the time and Sister Catherine was her guiding light. The assurances by Sister Catherine, as events unfolded, turned out to be tragically overly optimistic. The decision to remain in a country in which the applicant was persecuted after release from prison does not necessarily undercut an applicant's claim for asylum, if adequately explained. <i>See, e.g., Turcios v. INS,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"490190\"><a href=\"/opinion/490190/hugo-turcios-v-immigration-naturalization-service/\"><span class=\"volume\">821</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1396</span></a></span>, 1401-02 (9th Cir.1987) (finding that it was unreasonable for the IJ to determine that the government of the alien's country of origin would not have persecuted him because the alien remained in that country for several months after his release from prison when he was under constant surveillance).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, Mukamusoni testified that after the death of every member of her immediate family, she was without any means of economic or emotional support excepting the generosity of Sister Catherine. She testified in essence that there was literally nothing for her to do in Uganda or Rwanda; her only means of obtaining an education was at the National University of Rwanda, where Rwandans are entitled to education at the government's expense. A decision she made to go back to the only place where she could obtain a \"free\" education, at Sister Catherine's urging, is insufficient to show, against this record, that her fears of persecution in Rwanda were not genuine. Faced with no viable means of support otherwise, people take risks in the face of their fears. Mukamusoni's subsequent entries into Rwanda to obtain her transcripts were also motivated by both Sister Catherine's urging and Mukamusoni's desperate attempt to preserve the possibility of a better life through the hope of obtaining an education.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn10\" id=\"fn10_ref\">10</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Viewing the record as a whole, including the evidence the BIA ignored and assuming Mukamusoni's credibility as did the BIA, we cannot conscientiously find that the evidence supporting the BIA's determination that Mukamusoni failed to meet her burden of proof is substantial. <i>See Universal Camera Corp.,</i> 340 U.S. at 488, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"104856\"><a href=\"/opinion/104856/universal-camera-corp-v-nlrb/\"><span class=\"volume\">71</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.
