Calvesbert, Enrique A. Báez, and Calvesbert Law\nOffices PSC on brief for appellant.\n\n\n\n\n                           March 29, 2005\n\f           Per   Curiam.   This   case   involves   the   efforts   by   an\n\nattorney to convince a federal court to permit him to withdraw his\n\nappearance or at least require that his client pay him for his work\n\nin a trial.   Attorney Paul E. Calvesbert (or more accurately, his\n\nprofessional services corporation) represented Rivera-Domenech in\n\nan admiralty case in federal court between Angel L. Rivera-Domenech\n\nand Quality Boat Services (and other defendants).\n\n                                  I.\n\n           We describe the facts as alleged by attorney Calvesbert.\n\nIn January 1998, Rivera-Domenech retained Calvesbert to represent\n\nhim in the underlying admiralty action (for simplicity, we refer to\n\nthe law firm and the lawyer collectively with the lawyer's name).\n\nIn late February 1998, Calvesbert sent Rivera-Domenech a fee\n\nagreement, which Rivera-Domenech executed on March 2, 1998.              In\n\nApril of 1998, Calvesbert filed a federal complaint for Rivera-\n\nDomenech against Quality Boat Services and other defendants, and\n\nthen proceeded to pursue the admiralty action. By October of 2000,\n\nthe lawyer and the client were in the middle of a fee argument.\n\nAccording to Calvesbert, Rivera-Domenech by then owed him more than\n\n$10,000.\n\n           The bench trial before a magistrate judge started on\n\nOctober 16, 2001; the trial was then continued on October 17 until\n\nNovember 7, 2001.    A further series of reschedulings followed and\n\ntrial was ultimately set for April 23, 2002.\n\n\n                                  -2-\n\f           On March 26, 2002, Calvesbert attempted to resolve the\n\nfee amount owed, now around $60,000, by proposing in a letter that\n\nRivera-Domenech    convert    the    representation    agreement    into   a\n\ncontingency fee arrangement.        Calvesbert gave a deadline of April\n\n1 to respond or Calvesbert would file a motion to withdraw his\n\nappearance in the case. On April 8, Rivera-Domenech responded. In\n\nhis response, Rivera-Domenech attacked the integrity of his lawyer;\n\nno resolution was reached on the fees.\n\n           Calvesbert then moved to withdraw from representation for\n\nlack of payment and irreconcilable differences on April 10, 2002,\n\nand sought continuance of the April 23 trial date.           Calvesbert did\n\nnot then ask in the alternative for the court to order the payment\n\nof fees.   On April 12, 2002, the magistrate judge denied the motion\n\nto withdraw, without hearing, commenting only that \"[t]he trial\n\nwill not be continued.\"\n\n           Calvesbert,   on   April    15,   2002,   moved   the   court   to\n\nreconsider the denial of his motion to withdraw on the ground of\n\nirreconcilable    differences   and    argued   that   his   fee   agreement\n\npermitted him to withdraw.          A copy of the fee agreement was\n\nattached and contained an arbitration provision:\n\n           Any controversy, claim or dispute in the\n           course   and  scope   of  the   lawyer-client\n           relationship or arising out of or relating to\n           this Proposal or the breach, termination,\n           enforcement,   interpretation   or   validity\n           thereof, including the determination of the\n           scope or applicability of this agreement to\n           arbitrate (hereinafter the \"Dispute\"), shall\n\n                                     -3-\n\f            be determined by arbitration in San Juan,\n            Puerto Rico, before a sole arbitrator, in\n            accordance with the laws and rules of\n            professional conduct of the Commonwealth of\n            Puerto Rico.      \"Disputes\" shall include,\n            without limitation, those involving fees,\n            costs,   billing,   claims   of   professional\n            negligence, malpractice and breach of ethical\n            or fiduciary duties. The arbitration shall be\n            administered by the American Arbitration\n            Association (AAA) pursuant to its Commercial\n            Arbitration Rules and Supplementary Procedures\n            for Large, Complex Disputes. The arbitrator\n            shall be a licensed attorney in Puerto Rico\n            and a member of the AAA Panel of Arbitrators.\n\nThis motion was also denied \"[n]otwithstanding the deterioration of\n\nthe relationship between counsel and client.\"         Calvesbert then\n\nfiled an \"Urgent Appeal From Magistrate Judge's Orders\" pursuant to\n\n28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) and the Local Rules of the District of\n\nPuerto Rico.     This \"appeal\" was an appeal to the district court\n\nfrom the order by the magistrate judge, but it was denied by the\n\nmagistrate     judge.1   Calvesbert    did   not   seek   to   file   an\n\ninterlocutory appeal to this court from the denial of the motion to\n\nwithdraw.    The result was that Calvesbert was effectively required\n\n\n     1\n      We do not understand why this appeal was not ruled upon by\nthe federal district judge, who was the proper decision maker for\nthe appeal. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(A) (\"A [district] judge of\nthe court may reconsider any pretrial matter [decided by the\nmagistrate]. . . where it has been shown that the magistrate\njudge's order is clearly erroneous or contrary to law.\").       The\nmotion also referred to what was then Rule 510 of the Local Rules\nof the District of Puerto Rico, which stated, \"The [district] Judge\nto whom the case is assigned shall consider the appeal and shall\nset aside any portion of the Magistrate Judge Order found to be\nclearly erroneous or contrary to law.\"      D.P.R.R. 510.   In any\nevent, this procedural problem was not raised on appeal before this\ncourt.\n\n                                 -4-\n\fto continue to represent Rivera-Domenech, a hostile client, at\n\ntrial   without   payment   at   the    time.   Bench   trial   before   the\n\nmagistrate judge was held on April 23, 25, and May 13, and the\n\ncourt, on its own motion, set further bench trial for six days in\n\nSeptember 2002, starting with September 3.\n\n           Trying another tack, Calvesbert sought an order that he\n\nbe paid reasonable fees because he was being forced to continue to\n\nrepresent Rivera-Domenech by the court.            Calvesbert moved to\n\nintervene as a third-party plaintiff on June 17, 2002, against\n\nRivera-Domenech, to assert his attorney's fees claim.              Rivera-\n\nDomenech did not object.     The magistrate judge allowed Calvesbert\n\npermissive intervention on June 20, 2002.           On August 5, 2002,\n\nCalvesbert filed his first motion requesting an order from the\n\ncourt that his client pay him the sums claimed -- $82,641.94 -- as\n\na corollary of the order denying his motion to withdraw.          This was\n\nbefore trial recommenced in September.          The court on August 27,\n\n2002, denied that motion without comment.\n\n           After the bench trial ended on September 13, 2002, the\n\ncourt granted Calvesbert and Rivera-Domenech 20 days to meet and\n\nsettle their fee differences, and if they failed, to let the court\n\nknow so that a trial date for the intervenor claim for payment of\n\nfees could be set.     It is unclear what amount in fees Calvesbert\n\nthought Rivera-Domenech owed at that point.\n\n\n\n\n                                       -5-\n\f             On October 23, 2002, Rivera-Domenech filed a pro se\n\nmotion alerting the court to the arbitration clause in the original\n\nfee agreement.       The court treated the motion as a motion for an\n\norder compelling arbitration of the fee dispute, ordered the\n\nparties      to   undergo     arbitration,      and    dismissed     Calvesbert's\n\nintervening claim for payment of fees without prejudice on December\n\n30, 2002.\n\n                                          II.\n\n             Calvesbert was ultimately unsuccessful in the attempt\n\nbelow to obtain the desired relief from the district court: payment\n\nof fees both from before and after the denial of the motion to\n\nwithdraw his appearance.            Calvesbert presents four arguments on\n\nappeal: 1) the district court erred by not allowing him to withdraw\n\nbefore commencement of or during trial; 2) the district court\n\nshould have held a hearing on his motion to withdraw; 3) the\n\ndistrict court       should    have   conditioned          Calvesbert's   continued\n\nrepresentation of Rivera-Domenech upon posting of adequate security\n\nby Rivera-Domenech to cover reasonable attorney's fees; and 4) the\n\ndistrict court should not have sent the attorney's fee dispute to\n\narbitration. The client, Rivera-Domenech, has not filed a reply on\n\nappeal.\n\n             We make a point clear at the start.               At the time of the\n\nentry   of    the   denial     of   the    motion     to    withdraw,     there   was\n\ninterlocutory jurisdiction to take an appeal to this court.                       See\n\n\n                                          -6-\n\fFidelity Nat'l Title Ins. Co. of N.Y.      v. Intercounty Nat'l Title\n\nIns. Co., 310 F.3d 537, 539 (7th Cir. 2002); Whiting v. Lacara, 187\n\nF.3d 317, 319-20 (2d Cir. 1999).       Calvesbert should have pursued\n\nthe interlocutory appeal at the time of the denial of his motion to\n\nwithdraw   his   appearance.2   In   similar    circumstances,   circuit\n\ncourts, including this one, have found the denial of a motion to\n\nwithdraw to be an abuse of discretion.         See, e.g., Fidelity, 310\n\nF.3d at 540-41; Lieberman v. Polytop Corp., 2 Fed. Appx. 37, 39-40\n\n(1st Cir. 2001) (unpublished opinion).      In Lieberman, we reversed\n\nthe district court's denial of a motion to withdraw and explained:\n\n           It simply expects too much of counsel to\n           expend the additional energy necessary to go\n           to trial, and to front the necessary expenses,\n           without any real assurance that he will be\n           paid for any of it, especially where he\n           already is owed a substantial sum and the\n           client has violated the written fee agreement.\n           Further, if counsel does not expend the\n           necessary effort and does not front the trial\n           expenses, he very well could expose himself to\n           civil liability to his client. We refuse to\n           place counsel in such a position.\n\n\n\n\n     2\n      We do not suggest that Calvesbert waived his right to a final\nappeal by failing to file an interlocutory appeal, only that he has\nlimited the relief available. The general rule is that failure to\ntake an interlocutory appeal does not automatically foreclose\nreview after final judgment.     See 16 C. Wright et al., Federal\nPractice and Procedure § 3921, at 19 (2d ed. 1996) (\"[F]ailure to\ntake an available [interlocutory] appeal does not of itself waive\nthe right to secure review, on appeal from final judgment, of\nmatters that could have been appealed but were not.\").\n\n                                 -7-\n\f2 Fed. Appx. at 39-40.   Here, in addition, it is plain there was an\n\nirretrievable breakdown between client and counsel, yet the court\n\nrefused to allow Calvesbert to withdraw.\n\n          By not taking an interlocutory appeal, Calvesbert has\n\neffectively mooted any relief from the erroneous order denying his\n\nmotion to withdraw.   He has now represented the client through the\n\ntrial.   His claim that the district court should have held a\n\nhearing on the motion to withdraw is similarly moot.\n\n          Moreover, as for Calvesbert's claim that the district\n\ncourt should have conditioned his continued representation of\n\nRivera-Domenech upon the client's posting of adequate security, he\n\nhas waived the argument by not asking for such relief from the\n\ndistrict court in the proceedings below.   See McCoy v. Mass. Inst.\n\nof Tech., 950 F.2d 13, 22 (1st Cir. 1991).\n\n          That leaves Calvesbert's appeal from the order compelling\n\narbitration and dismissing his claim for fees without prejudice.\n\nThe only relief Calvesbert wants at this point is that the court,\n\nnot the arbitrator, decide the fee issue.      Whether the district\n\ncourt had ancillary jurisdiction to issue such an order is a nice\n\nquestion. Two members of this panel conclude it did; one concludes\n\nit did not.   But we make no holding on the point.\n\n          Courts have rested the exercise of jurisdiction over fee\n\ndisputes related to proceedings before them on the doctrine of\n\n\n\n\n                                 -8-\n\fancillary jurisdiction.3       See, e.g., Pay Tel. of Greater N.Y., Inc.\n\nv. Sheridan, 766 F.2d 92, 94 (2d Cir. 1985) (explaining that \"in\n\nsetting fees [due a withdrawing attorney] the district court is\n\nexercising ancillary jurisdiction\"); Jenkins v. Weinshienk, 670\n\nF.2d 915, 918 (10th Cir. 1982) (considering \"the scope of a federal\n\ntrial court's ancillary jurisdiction to adjudicate fee disputes\").\n\n            A court's power to protect a lawyer against unfairness by\n\nhis client in the context of a motion to withdraw seems to be an\n\ninherent      power     necessary         to     effectuate   orderly     judicial\n\nproceedings.      See, e.g., Fed. Sav. & Loan Ins. Corp. v. Ferrante,\n\n364 F.3d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir. 2004) (surveying cases in which\n\ncourts     had    jurisdiction       to     resolve    \"attorney    fee    disputes\n\ncollateral to the underlying litigation\").\n\n            But there are disagreements about the scope of that\n\njurisdiction.      In Broughten v. Voss, 634 F.2d 880 (5th Cir. 1981),\n\nthe   court      held   that   the        district    court   had   no    ancillary\n\njurisdiction, sua sponte, to make resolution of a fee dispute\n\nbetween a law firm and its client a condition precedent for\n\ngranting the law firm's motion to withdraw.               Id. at 881-83.     As the\n\noutcome in Broughten illustrates, whether ancillary jurisdiction\n\n\n\n      3\n      The Supreme Court has explained ancillary jurisdiction as a\nway \"to enable a court to function successfully, that is, to manage\nits proceedings, vindicate its authority, and effectuate its\ndecrees.\" Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375,\n379-80 (1994); see also 13B C. Wright et al., Federal Practice and\nProcedure § 3567.3, at 96 (Supp. 2004).\n\n                                           -9-\n\fexists over this particular dispute is a question over which\n\nreasonable minds may disagree.      However, the particular facts of\n\nthis   case    make   it   unnecessary    to    resolve    this   question\n\ndefinitively.\n\n            Regardless of the jurisdictional issue, the resolution\n\nthat Calvesbert must go through arbitration is correct. Calvesbert\n\nwanted the district court to resolve the fee dispute in his favor,\n\nbut \"the strong federal policy favoring arbitration agreements . .\n\n. requires us to resolve any doubts concerning arbitrability in\n\nfavor of arbitration,\" Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Gilbane Bldg.\n\nCo., 992 F.2d 386, 388 (1st Cir. 1993) (internal quotation marks\n\nomitted).     Calvesbert had agreed in his original fee agreement to\n\nhave an arbitrator decide the fee dispute, not the court.          There is\n\nno   unfairness:   Calvesbert   drafted   the   original   fee    agreement\n\nreferring all disputes to arbitration.          Nor did Rivera-Domenech\n\nwaive his rights to demand arbitration.\n\n            We dismiss Calvesbert's appeal for lack of merit.           No\n\ncosts are awarded.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -10-\n\f",

Calvesbert presents four arguments on appeal: 1) the district court erred by not allowing him to withdraw before commencement of or during trial; 2) the district court should have held a hearing on his motion to withdraw; 3) the district court should have conditioned Calvesbert's continued representation of Rivera-Domenech upon posting of adequate security by Rivera-Domenech to cover reasonable attorney's fees; and 4) the district court should not have sent the attorney's fee dispute to arbitration.

At the time of the entry of the denial of the motion to withdraw, there was interlocutory jurisdiction to take an appeal to this court. <i>See Fidelity Nat'l Title Ins. Co. of N.Y. v. Intercounty Nat'l Title Ins. Co.,</i> 310 F.3d 537, 539 (7th Cir.2002); <i>Whiting v. Lacara,</i> 187 F.3d 317, 319-20 (2d Cir.1999). Calvesbert should have pursued the interlocutory appeal at the time of the denial of his motion to withdraw his appearance.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> In similar circumstances, circuit courts, including this one, have found the denial of a motion to withdraw to be an abuse of discretion. <i>See, e.g., Fidelity,</i> 310 F.3d at 540-41; <i>Lieberman v. Polytop Corp.,</i> 2 Fed.Appx. 37, 39-40 (1st Cir.2001) (unpublished opinion). In <i>Lieberman,</i> we reversed the district court's denial of a motion to withdraw and explained:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It simply expects too much of counsel to expend the additional energy necessary to go to trial, and to front the necessary expenses, without any real assurance that he will be paid for any of it, especially where he already is owed a substantial sum and the client has violated the written fee agreement. Further, if counsel does not expend the necessary effort and does not front the trial expenses, he very well could expose himself to civil liability to his client. We refuse to place counsel in such a position.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2 Fed.Appx. at 39-40. Here, in addition, it is plain there was an irretrievable breakdown between client and counsel, yet the court refused to allow Calvesbert to withdraw.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">By not taking an interlocutory appeal, Calvesbert has effectively mooted any relief from the erroneous order denying his motion to withdraw. He has now represented the client through the trial. His claim that the district court should have held a hearing on the motion to withdraw is similarly moot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, as for Calvesbert's claim that the district court should have conditioned his continued representation of Rivera-Domenech upon the client's posting of adequate security, he has waived the argument by not asking for such relief from the district court in the proceedings below. <i>See McCoy v. Mass.

The only relief Calvesbert wants at this point is that the court, not the arbitrator, decide the fee issue. Whether the district court had ancillary jurisdiction to issue such an order is a nice question. Two members of this panel conclude it did; one concludes it did not.

Sheridan,</i> 766 F.2d 92, 94 (2d Cir.1985) (explaining that \"in setting fees [due a withdrawing attorney] the district court is exercising ancillary jurisdiction\"); <i>Jenkins v.

Sav. &amp; Loan Ins. Corp. v. Ferrante,</i> 364 F.3d 1037, 1041 (9th Cir.2004) (surveying cases in which courts had jurisdiction to resolve \"attorney fee disputes collateral to the underlying litigation\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">But there are disagreements about the scope of that jurisdiction. In <i>Broughten v. Voss,</i> 634 F.2d 880 (5th Cir.1981), the court held that the district court had no ancillary jurisdiction, sua sponte, to make resolution of a fee dispute between a law firm and its client a condition precedent for granting the law firm's motion to withdraw. <i>Id.</i> at 881-83. As the outcome in <i>Broughten</i> illustrates, whether ancillary jurisdiction exists over this particular dispute is a question over which reasonable minds may disagree. However, the particular facts of this case make it unnecessary to resolve this question definitively.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Regardless of the jurisdictional issue, the resolution that Calvesbert must go through arbitration is correct. Calvesbert wanted the district court to resolve the fee dispute in his favor, but \"the strong federal policy favoring arbitration agreements ... requires us to resolve any doubts concerning arbitrability in favor of arbitration,\" <i>Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Gilbane Bldg. Co.,</i> 992 F.2d 386, 388 (1st Cir.1993) (internal quotation marks omitted). Calvesbert had agreed in his original fee agreement to have an arbitrator decide the fee dispute, not the court. There is no unfairness: Calvesbert drafted the original fee agreement referring all disputes to arbitration. Nor did Rivera-Domenech waive his rights to demand arbitration.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We <i>dismiss</i> Calvesbert's appeal for lack of merit.

Attorney Paul E. Calvesbert (or more accurately, his professional services corporation) represented Rivera-Domenech in an admiralty case in federal court between Angel L. Rivera-Domenech and Quality Boat Services (and other defendants).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We describe the facts as alleged by attorney Calvesbert. In January 1998, Rivera-Domenech retained Calvesbert to represent him in the underlying admiralty action (for simplicity, we refer to the law firm and the lawyer collectively with the lawyer's name). In late February 1998, Calvesbert sent Rivera-Domenech a fee agreement, which Rivera-Domenech executed on March 2, 1998. In April of 1998, Calvesbert filed a federal complaint for Rivera-Domenech against Quality Boat Services and other defendants, and then proceeded to pursue the admiralty action. By October of 2000, the lawyer and the client were in the middle of a fee argument. According to Calvesbert, Rivera-Domenech by then owed him more than $10,000.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The bench trial before a magistrate judge started on October 16, 2001; the trial was then continued on October 17 until November 7, 2001. A further series of reschedulings followed and trial was ultimately set for April 23, 2002.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On March 26, 2002, Calvesbert attempted to resolve the fee amount owed, now around $60,000, by proposing in a letter that Rivera-Domenech convert the representation agreement into a contingency fee arrangement. Calvesbert gave a deadline of April 1 to respond or Calvesbert would file a motion to withdraw his appearance in the case. On April 8, Rivera-Domenech responded. In his response, Rivera-Domenech attacked the integrity of his lawyer; no resolution was reached on the fees.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calvesbert then moved to withdraw from representation for lack of payment and irreconcilable differences on April 10, 2002, and sought continuance of the April 23 trial date. Calvesbert did not then ask in the alternative for the court to order the payment of fees. On April 12, 2002, the magistrate judge denied the motion to withdraw, without hearing, commenting only that \"[t]he trial will not be continued.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Calvesbert, on April 15, 2002, moved the court to reconsider the denial of his motion to withdraw on the ground of irreconcilable differences and argued that his fee agreement permitted him to withdraw.
