Molly Raymond; MOLLY RAYMOND; B.R.,\n                 a minor, P.P.A. Molly Raymond,\n\n                      Plaintiffs, Appellants,\n\n                                v.\n\n     MARGARET GLORIA; STEPHANIE TERRY; STATE OF RHODE ISLAND\n           DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN, YOUTH, AND FAMILIES,\n\n                      Defendants, Appellees.\n\n\n          APPEAL FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n                FOR THE DISTRICT OF RHODE ISLAND\n\n              [Hon. William E. Smith, District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                        Lynch, Chief Judge,\n                 Lipez and Howard, Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Thomas L. Mirza and Pelletier & Mirza, LLP were on brief for\nappellants.\n     Genevieve M. Allaire Johnson, Special Assistant Attorney\nGeneral, with whom Patrick C. Lynch, Attorney General, were on\nbrief for appellees.\n\n\n\n                         January 27, 2010\n\f            LYNCH, Chief Judge.    This is one of several cases before\n\nthis court claiming that the state of Rhode Island has failed to\n\nprotect children in its care.\n\n            Plaintiffs, a family whose twins were in foster care,\n\nhere appeal from the district court's grant during trial of a Rule\n\n50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law to the defendants,\n\nMargaret Gloria, a social worker for the Rhode Island Department of\n\nChildren, Youth, and Families (DCYF), and Stephanie Terry, her\n\nsupervisor.    See J.R. v. Gloria, 599 F. Supp. 2d 182, 205 (D.R.I.\n\n2009).\n\n            Plaintiffs J. R. and B.R., twin boys and minors, and\n\ntheir mother, Molly Raymond, brought substantive due process claims\n\nunder 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state law claims under Rhode Island\n\nnegligence law for damages against the two state DCYF officials.\n\nPlaintiffs allege that when the twins were living in foster care\n\nbetween November 1996 and May 1998, from the ages of four to five,\n\nthey were physically and sexually abused by Samuel \"Thinman\"\n\nStevens, who they say lived in the foster home and acted as the\n\ntwins' de facto caretaker.        They claim this abuse resulted from\n\ndefendants'     actionable   failures    to   comply   with   state   law\n\nrequirements.\n\n            The question before us is whether the court erred in\n\ngranting defendants immunity from the federal and state law claims\n\nat issue.     We hold that the district court properly granted\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fdefendants qualified immunity on the § 1983 action and judgment for\n\ndefendants on state sovereign immunity and qualified immunity\n\ndefenses under Rhode Island state law. This case also demonstrates\n\nthe adage that claims based on possible violations of state laws do\n\nnot necessarily make out claims of violations of federal due\n\nprocess guarantees.\n\n                                      I.\n\n          Because this is an appeal from a grant of a Rule 50(a)\n\nmotion, we recount the facts in the light most favorable to\n\nplaintiffs.   See Philip v. Cronin, 537 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir. 2008);\n\nsee also Jennings v. Jones, 587 F.3d 430, 438 (1st Cir. 2009).\n\n          J.R. and B.R. were placed in a foster home in Providence,\n\nRhode Island with Faith Sykes and her husband, Marron Smith, in\n\nNovember 1996, when they were four years old.               Neither defendant\n\nhad a role in the placement decision.          There is no claim that the\n\ntwins should not have been placed in foster care or that the\n\ninitial placement in the Sykes home was inappropriate.                Rather,\n\nplaintiffs'   case    turns    upon    defendants'    alleged     failure    to\n\ninvestigate   and    prevent   the    events   that   are   alleged   to    have\n\noccurred during this placement.\n\n          Plaintiffs claim that from the time the twins were placed\n\nin the Sykes home in November 1996 until they were removed in May\n\n1998, defendant Gloria and others in DCYF knew that two adult men,\n\nSamuel Stevens, whom the twins referred to as \"Thinman,\" and\n\n\n                                      -3-\n\fWilliam Lovick, whom the twins called \"Bobo,\" were living on the\n\nthird floor of the Sykes residence.1                  There were also numerous\n\nindications that both men, at various points, were acting as the\n\ntwins' de facto caretakers.2         Indeed, Stevens was such a regular\n\npresence at the Sykes home that Mary Starnes, the assigned DCYF\n\ncase aide, identified the home with reference to \"Thinman\" in her\n\nnotes, and she reported numerous interactions with Stevens to\n\ndefendant Gloria.        Stevens also accompanied Gloria to some of the\n\ntwins' counseling sessions.         Defendant Terry was also aware that\n\nStevens and Lovick were involved in the twins' lives.\n\n            DCYF    apparently     did    not       ever   complete     background\n\ninvestigations      of   either   Stevens      or     Lovick,   although       DCYF's\n\nregulations required the agency to screen any adult resident or\n\nregular caretaker in a foster home.                 See R.I. Dep't of Youth,\n\nChildren,     and   Families,     State   of     Rhode     Island     Foster    Care\n\nRegulations     §   II.C,     Clearances        and    Record    Checks        (1998)\n\n[hereinafter \"Foster Care Regulations\"].                   Plaintiffs say that\n\nGloria also told Sykes that both Stevens and Lovick could remain in\n\n\n\n     1\n          For the purposes of this opinion, we will refer to the\nmen by their last names as \"Stevens\" and \"Lovick.\" William Lovick\nis also referred to as \"Lovikk\" and \"Lovett\" in the records.\n     2\n          Plaintiffs do not allege that Lovick was responsible for\nthe abuse they say occurred in the Sykes home.       Rather, they\nportray his ongoing presence in the home without any background\ninvestigation as evidence of DCYF's lax supervision of the twins'\nfoster care environment.\n\n                                      -4-\n\fthe home and knew that Sykes depended upon them to help supervise\n\nthe twins.\n\n           Additionally, neither Sykes nor defendants Gloria or\n\nTerry ever reported to DCYF's licensing division that these men\n\nwere residing in the home or that they were acting as caretakers\n\nfor the twins.   DCYF regulations required foster parents to inform\n\nthe department of any such changes in foster household composition.\n\nSee Foster Care Regulations §§ V.2; V.Q.           In August 1997, DCYF's\n\nlicensing division nonetheless renewed Sykes's foster home license.\n\nFoster home licenses can be revoked if the foster parent fails to\n\nnotify DCYF of changes in household composition or if the foster\n\nparent omits important facts about the foster environment.               Id.\n\n§ III.C.\n\n           There were various Child Abuse and Neglect Tracking\n\nSystem (CANTS) investigations of the twins' care during their\n\neighteen-month   stay   in   the   Sykes   home.     Two   of   the   reports\n\nmentioned Lovick but not Stevens.          In March 1997, J.R. told DCYF\n\ncase aide Starnes that \"Bobo\" (Lovick) had hit him, but the twins\n\ndid not answer further questions, and after further investigation,\n\nDCYF deemed the report unfounded.           In August 1997, a separate\n\ninvestigation mentioning Lovick was initiated when the twins'\n\ncounselor noticed J.R. had scratch marks on his head and neck.\n\nDCYF determined this report was also unfounded after the twins said\n\nthese injuries came from fighting with each other.          DCYF also made\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fa formal finding that there was insufficient evidence to conclude\n\nthat Lovick was improperly supervising the children.\n\n            There were also several other reported incidents between\n\nthe spring and fall of 1997 in which the twins exhibited behavioral\n\nproblems    or     physical   injuries,   including    bruises.   With    the\n\nexception of the reports discussed above, none of these reports\n\nmentioned either Stevens or Lovick.           DCYF determined that none of\n\nthese reports supported a formal finding of likely abuse.\n\n            On May 27, 1998, one of the twins' teachers called the\n\nDCYF hotline because she had noticed bruises on their forearms.\n\nThe twins told a DCYF investigator that the bruises were made when\n\n\"Thinman\" (Stevens) hit them with a belt and that he had done this\n\nbefore.      This was the first report mentioning Stevens.                The\n\ninvestigator took the twins to the hospital and documented their\n\ninjuries.        DCYF also discovered a belt in the Sykes home in the\n\nlocation the twins had described.             DCYF permanently removed the\n\ntwins     from    the   Sykes   home   that    same   day.    Following    an\n\ninvestigation, DCYF determined that there was credible evidence of\n\ninstitutional neglect by Sykes and abuse by Stevens.\n\n            In March 1999, some ten months after the twins were\n\nremoved, the twins' mother and a counselor jointly reported for the\n\nfirst time that B.R. and J.R. had said \"Thinman\" had sexually\n\nabused them.        DCYF investigated but determined the report was\n\ninconsistent and unfounded.        Still, we will assume, in plaintiffs'\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\ffavor, that the report was correct because the harm it alleges is\n\nthe foundation of their suit.              Since the twins left the Sykes\n\nfoster home in 1998, they have suffered from a number of severe\n\ndevelopmental challenges and have required ongoing institutional\n\ncare.\n\n               Plaintiffs originally sued Gloria and Terry for state law\n\nnegligence claims in Rhode Island state court in 2001, but they\n\namended the complaint to allege constitutional violations under 42\n\nU.S.C. § 1983 in 2008.               Gloria and Terry removed the case to\n\nfederal court on April 15, 2008.               The case proceeded to a jury\n\ntrial.    On November 17, 2008, at the close of plaintiffs' case and\n\nafter    six    days    of   trial   during    which    nineteen   witnesses    for\n\nplaintiffs testified, defendants filed a Rule 50(a) motion for\n\njudgment as a matter of law.            They asserted, among other grounds,\n\na qualified immunity defense to the § 1983 claim and immunity to\n\nthe state law negligence claims based on Rhode Island's state\n\nsovereign immunity and state qualified immunity law.\n\n               In a decision and order dated February 26, 2009, the\n\ndistrict court entered judgment for the defendants.                 J.R., 599 F.\n\nSupp. 2d at 183.         It held that Gloria and Terry were entitled to\n\nqualified immunity against the § 1983 claims because plaintiffs'\n\nevidence,      taking    all   the    inferences   in    their   favor,   had   not\n\nestablished that there was a substantive due process violation or\n\nthat such a right was clearly established at the time of the\n\n\n                                         -7-\n\falleged violation.    Id. at 192-204.        It further held that Gloria\n\nand Terry were immune from state tort liability for their official\n\nconduct because of Rhode Island's state sovereign immunity and that\n\nGloria was entitled to state law qualified immunity from the\n\nindividual negligence claim.          Id. at 204-05.\n\n                                       II.\n\n            We review de novo a grant of judgment under Rule 50(a).\n\nSee Hatfield-Bermudez v. Aldanondo-Rivera, 496 F.3d 51, 59 (1st\n\nCir. 2007).     We review the district court's underlying legal\n\nconclusions de novo and take the evidence in the light most\n\nfavorable to the plaintiffs.          See id. at 61.\n\nA.          Federal Constitutional Claims under § 1983\n\n            Officials are entitled to qualified immunity against\n\nclaims of federal constitutional violations unless (1) \"the facts\n\nthat a plaintiff has alleged or shown make out a violation of a\n\nconstitutional right\" and (2) \"the right at issue was 'clearly\n\nestablished'   at   the   time   of    defendant's     alleged   misconduct.\"\n\nPearson v. Callahan, 129 S. Ct. 808, 816 (2009) (internal citations\n\nomitted).\n\n            The district court held that plaintiffs' case failed on\n\nboth grounds. On appeal, plaintiffs challenge the district court's\n\nruling that Gloria and Terry were entitled to qualified immunity\n\nbecause, inter alia, plaintiffs had not put forward evidence that\n\n\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fcould establish the first prong, that there was a substantive due\n\nprocess violation.\n\n          Plaintiffs' substantive due process theory turns upon\n\nGloria's and Terry's alleged failures to protect the twins from the\n\nrisks present in their foster home.    Plaintiffs argue that Gloria\n\nand Terry knew that the twins were regularly being cared for by two\n\nunknown, uninvestigated adult male residents, Samuel \"Thinman\"\n\nStevens and William \"Bobo\" Lovick.     They also say that the number\n\nof DCYF investigations before May 1998 should have alerted Gloria\n\nand Terry to the possibility of abuse in the home.\n\n          Plaintiffs   further     argue   that   defendants   were\n\n\"deliberately indifferent\" to these apparent risks because they\n\nfailed to conduct background checks on Stevens and Lovick, did not\n\nreport these changes in household composition, and failed to\n\nmaintain regular, direct contact with the twins, even though,\n\nplaintiffs say, DCYF regulations required these steps to be taken.\n\nHad defendants told DCYF's licensing unit about Stevens's and\n\nLovick's unreported presence in the home, plaintiffs say DCYF would\n\nhave revoked the foster license.     Plaintiffs theorize that if the\n\nlicense had been revoked, the boys would have been removed and they\n\nwould not have been harmed.\n\n          We reject plaintiffs' argument and affirm the district\n\ncourt's holding that Gloria and Terry were entitled to qualified\n\nimmunity because plaintiffs failed to establish on the facts that\n\n\n                                 -9-\n\fthere was a substantive due process violation. We need not address\n\nwhether any such \"right\" would have been clearly established at the\n\ntime of the alleged violation, Saucier v. Katz, 533 U.S. 194, 201\n\n(2001), though we note that plaintiffs did not challenge the\n\ndistrict court's holding on this issue.\n\n            A Due Process Clause claim requires that there be a\n\ndeprivation of life, liberty, or property by the government. Here,\n\nthe deprivations alleged were by private parties.            \"As a general\n\nmatter . . . a State's failure to protect an individual against\n\nprivate violence simply does not constitute a violation of the Due\n\nProcess Clause,\" unless the government is responsible for the\n\ndeprivation.    DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,\n\n489 U.S. 189, 197, 199-200 (1989).           There is no claim that the\n\nstate officials here actively directed or assisted private actors\n\nin causing harm.\n\n            We have, under some language in DeShaney, posited that in\n\nsituations where a state creates a \"special relationship\" because\n\nof   \"the   limitation     which   [the    state]   has   imposed   on   [an\n\nindividual's] freedom to act on his own behalf,\" its subsequent\n\nfailure to protect an individual may amount to a substantive due\n\nprocess violation.       Rivera v. Rhode Island, 402 F.3d 27, 34 (1st\n\nCir. 2005) (quoting DeShaney, 489 U.S. at 200).           That affirmative\n\nduty to protect does not arise from the state's knowledge of the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -10-\n\findividual's predicament or from its expression of intent to help\n\nhim, but instead from the limitation described.3\n\n          The mere creation of a special relationship, even if\n\nplacing   young   children   into    foster    care   created      such   a\n\nrelationship, is not enough to make out a due process claim for any\n\nharm that may follow.   Even then, the claim against the defendants\n\nmust also involve \"conscience-shocking\" conduct by state officials,\n\nsee id. at 35-36, and \"the official conduct 'most likely to rise to\n\nthe conscience-shocking level' is the 'conduct intended to injure\n\nin some way unjustifiable by any government interest.'\"          Chavez v.\n\nMartinez, 538 U.S. 760, 775 (2003) (quoting County of Sacramento v.\n\nLewis, 523 U.S. 833, 849 (1998)).          The Supreme Court has also\n\nrepeatedly \"expressed [its] reluctance to expand the doctrine of\n\nsubstantive due process.\" Id.; see also Maldonado v. Fontanes, 568\n\nF.3d 263, 273 (1st Cir. 2009).      In particular, the Court has made\n\nit clear that state officials' negligence, without more, is simply\n\ninsufficient to meet the conscience-shocking standard.           See Lewis,\n\n523 U.S. at 848-49.\n\n          We   assume   arguendo    that    DCYF   created   a    \"special\n\nrelationship\" because it affirmatively took responsibility for\n\nprotecting the twins from harm while they remained in foster care.\n\n\n\n     3\n          This case does not involve the state-created danger\ntheory, which this circuit has never, in any event, found\napplicable. See Véléz-Diaz v. Vega-Irizarry, 421 F.3d 71, 80 (1st\nCir. 2005).\n\n                                   -11-\n\fEven so, plaintiffs, on all of their evidence, did not make out a\n\nsubstantive due process claim.                    The evidence they put forward\n\nalleges troubling lapses in DCYF's supervision of the twins' foster\n\ncare       environment.        But   it    does    not   allege   any    behavior   by\n\ndefendants that would meet the legal definition of conscience-\n\nshocking conduct.\n\n               Plaintiffs argue that the legal standard for defining\n\nconduct that \"shocks the conscience\" is whether the state has acted\n\nwith \"deliberate indifference.\"                 That is not entirely correct.       As\n\nwe stated in Rivera, deliberately indifferent behavior does not per\n\nse shock the conscience.              Indeed, we suggested that it is only\n\n\"[i]n situations where actors have an opportunity to reflect and\n\nmake       reasoned     and     rational        decisions\"    that      \"deliberately\n\nindifferent behavior may suffice to shock the conscience.\"                          402\n\nF.3d at 36.4       The burden to show state conduct that \"shocks the\n\nconscience\" is extremely high, requiring \"stunning\" evidence of\n\n\"arbitrariness and caprice\" that extends beyond \"[m]ere violations\n\nof   state     law,     even   violations        resulting   from    bad   faith\"   to\n\n\"something       more     egregious       and    more    extreme.\"      DePoutot    v.\n\nRaffaelly, 424 F.3d 112, 119 (1st Cir. 2005).                  Gloria and Terry do\n\n\n       4\n          This circuit has never found on the facts of a case that\ndeliberately indifferent behavior was sufficiently conscience-\nshocking to violate a plaintiff's substantive due process rights.\nRivera merely suggested that under certain circumstances,\ndeliberately indifferent behavior could conceivably qualify. 402\nF.3d at 36; see also Ramos-Pinero v. Puerto Rico, 453 F.3d 48, 53\n(1st Cir. 2006).\n\n                                           -12-\n\fnot defend their actions on the basis that they were responding to\n\nan emergency, with no time to reflect, but on the basis that even\n\nif their conduct fell short of regulatory requirements, it did not\n\ncome close to shocking the conscience.\n\n          Plaintiffs' evidence did not show the defendants acted\n\neven with deliberate indifference.    Though other circuits have\n\nvaried in their formulations of when \"deliberate indifference\"\n\nrises to conscience-shocking conduct in the foster care context,\n\nstate officials must have been at least aware of known or likely\n\ninjuries or abuse and have chosen to ignore the danger to the\n\nchild.   See Nicini v. Morra, 212 F.3d 798, 810 (3d Cir. 2000)\n\n(listing cases); see also Waubanascum v. Shawano County, 416 F.3d\n\n658, 666-67 (7th Cir. 2005) (holding that plaintiffs must present\n\nevidence that \"the state actor knows or suspects that the . . .\n\nfoster parents with whom a child is placed are likely to abuse the\n\nchild\" to show deliberate indifference).\n\n          Even when the evidence is viewed in the light most\n\nfavorable to plaintiffs, no rational trier of fact could conclude\n\nthat the defendants were aware that the twins were in danger of\n\nbeing abused or otherwise harmed by Stevens.    Even if Gloria and\n\nTerry knew that Stevens and Lovick were living in and caring for\n\nthe twins in the Sykes home, Gloria and Terry had no reason on that\n\nbasis to identify them as a risk to the children.   Plaintiffs have\n\nnever asserted that Lovick was responsible for any of the harms\n\n\n                               -13-\n\fthey claim.      Previous reported incidents were investigated by DCYF\n\nand   deemed     not    credible.       Further,     the      reports   contained   no\n\nindication that Stevens was in any way involved.\n\n               Plaintiffs also argue that the various reported incidents\n\nshould be viewed in the aggregate as general warning signs of abuse\n\nin the home.      But these reports were all deemed unfounded until the\n\nMay 1998 incident that resulted in the twins' removal.                     Moreover,\n\nGloria's uncontested testimony indicated that DCYF social workers\n\nwere not ordinarily given much information about unfounded CANTS\n\nreports.        And    there    were    no    reports   of    suspected   abuse,    no\n\nindications of any injuries, and no reported behavioral problems\n\nbetween September 1997 and May 1998, which undercuts plaintiffs'\n\ntheory of escalating warning signs.\n\n               Furthermore, there is no evidence that defendants made a\n\nreasoned decision to deliberately ignore the risk of harm to the\n\ntwins     in   the     course   of     supervising      the    twins'   foster   care\n\nplacement. The defendants' failure to conduct background checks on\n\nStevens and Lovick and to report their residency at the Sykes home\n\nwere, at worst, possible violations of state law.5                      That failure\n\n\n      5\n          Because we are reviewing a Rule 50(a) motion, we accept\nplaintiffs' version of the facts surrounding the background checks.\nHowever, we note, as the district court observed, that defendants\nvigorously contested plaintiffs' claim that DCYF never conducted a\nstate background check on Stevens. DCYF officials testified that\nthey did conduct a background check on Stevens through the Rhode\nIsland Attorney General's Office, that no red flags appeared in it,\nand that this information was verbally conveyed to DCYF. See J.R.,\n599 F. Supp. 2d at 197 n.20.\n\n                                             -14-\n\fdoes not amount to inherently egregious conduct.                Plaintiffs'\n\ncontention that the twins would not have been abused if DCYF had\n\nrescinded the Sykes's foster home license or removed them from the\n\nSykes home at an earlier stage is an argument about \"but for\"\n\ncausation, but not about the defendants' intentions or actions.\n\n            The defendants are entitled to qualified immunity.            The\n\nsupervisory liability claim against Terry necessarily fails as\n\nwell.    See Rivera, 402 F.3d at 38-39.\n\nB.          State Law Claims\n\n            Plaintiffs also brought negligence claims under Rhode\n\nIsland   tort   law   against   Gloria    and   Terry   in   their   official\n\ncapacities and against Gloria in her individual capacity. We hold,\n\nas did the district court, that all of these claims are barred by\n\nRhode Island state law immunity doctrines.\n\n            Under Rhode Island law, state sovereign immunity is\n\nwaived and state entities and their official representatives can be\n\nsued for torts only if (1) the state entity has a \"special duty\" to\n\nthe plaintiffs, (2) the state entity has engaged in an \"egregious\"\n\nalleged act or omission, or (3) the state entity was engaging in\n\nthe kind of actions that private parties normally perform.                See\n\nKuzniar v. Keach, 709 A.2d 1050, 1053 (R.I. 1998); see also R. I.\n\nGen. Laws § 9-31-1.     We reject plaintiffs' argument on appeal that\n\nthe \"special duty\" exception applied and allowed suit against\n\nGloria and Terry in their official capacities.\n\n\n                                   -15-\n\f           The \"special duty\" exception applies only if (1) state\n\nofficials were aware of plaintiffs or their situation, (2) the\n\nofficials \"acted or failed to act in some way that was potentially\n\ninjurious\" to plaintiffs, and (3) it was \"reasonably foreseeable\"\n\nthat   plaintiffs'    injuries    would   result    from   these   acts   or\n\nomissions.   Morales v. Town of Johnston, 895 A.2d 721, 731 (R.I.\n\n2006).\n\n           Plaintiffs argue that the district court should have\n\nfound this \"special duty\" exception applicable given the court's\n\nconclusions in its substantive due process analysis that defendants\n\nhad a \"special relationship\" with plaintiffs and that plaintiffs'\n\nevidence might suffice to show negligence.\n\n           This argument ignores the district court's finding that\n\nthere was no evidence presented to show that defendants had any\n\n\"actual   knowledge   of   a   substantial   risk   of   harm.\"    Nor    did\n\nplaintiffs present evidence showing that defendants could have\n\nreasonably foreseen that either Stevens or Lovick were likely to\n\nabuse the children.    Plaintiffs' failure to present such evidence\n\nmeans that they cannot satisfy the third prong of this test.\n\nGloria and Terry remain entitled to immunity for the negligence\n\nclaims brought against them in their official capacities.                 See\n\nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 465 U.S. 89, 99-100, 106\n\n(1984) (holding that barring waiver by the state, the Eleventh\n\n\n\n\n                                   -16-\n\fAmendment      precludes     federal   courts     from    hearing     state   claims\n\nbrought against state officials in their official capacities).\n\n               Finally, as the district court held, Gloria is entitled\n\nto qualified immunity against the state law negligence claims made\n\nagainst her individually.         Rhode Island law allows state officials\n\nlike    Gloria    to   invoke    qualified      immunity     against    state    law\n\nnegligence      claims.     See Hatch v. Town of Middletown, 311 F.3d 83,\n\n90 (1st Cir. 2002).          Plaintiffs seem to suggest to the contrary,\n\nbut    their    argument     conflates    Rhode    Island's    waiver    of    state\n\nsovereign immunity under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1 in suits against\n\nstate officials in their official capacities with defendants'\n\nentitlement to qualified immunity for suits brought against them in\n\ntheir individual capacities.             Any challenge to the merits of the\n\ndistrict court's qualified immunity ruling is waived.\n\n               Plaintiffs     have     made     serious      allegations       about\n\nshortcomings      in   DCYF's    monitoring       of   the   twins'   foster    care\n\nplacement in the Sykes home.           But their remedy is not in court.\n\n               We affirm the district court's grant of judgment as a\n\nmatter of law to the defendants under Rule 50(a).\n\n               So ordered.\n\n\n\n\n                                         -17-\n\f",

Gloria,</i> 599 F.Supp.2d 182, 205 (D.R.I.2009).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs J.R. and B.R., twin boys and minors, and their mother, Molly Raymond, brought substantive due process claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state law claims under Rhode Island negligence law for damages against the two state DCYF officials. Plaintiffs allege that when the twins were living in foster care between November 1996 and May 1998, from the ages of four to five, they were physically and sexually abused by Samuel \"Thinman\" Stevens, who they say lived in the foster home and acted as the twins' de facto caretaker. They claim this abuse resulted from defendants' actionable failures to comply with state law requirements.</p>\n<p>The question before us is whether the court erred in granting defendants immunity from the federal and state law claims at issue. We hold that the district court properly granted defendants qualified immunity on the § 1983 action and judgment for defendants on state sovereign immunity and qualified immunity defenses under Rhode Island state law. This case also demonstrates the adage that claims based on possible violations of state laws do not necessarily make out claims of violations of federal due process guarantees.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Because this is an appeal from a grant of a Rule 50(a) motion, we recount the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs. <i>See </i><i>Philip v. Cronin,</i> 537 F.3d 26, 32 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also </i><i>Jennings v. Jones,</i> 587 F.3d 430, 438 (1st Cir.2009).</p>\n<p>J.R. and B.R. were placed in a foster home in Providence, Rhode Island with Faith Sykes and her husband, Marron Smith, in November 1996, when they were four years old. Neither defendant had a role in the placement decision. There is no claim that the twins should not have been placed in foster care or that the initial placement in the Sykes home was inappropriate. Rather, plaintiffs' case turns upon defendants' alleged failure to investigate and prevent the events that are alleged to have occurred during this placement.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs claim that from the time the twins were placed in the Sykes home in November 1996 until they were removed in May 1998, defendant Gloria and others in DCYF knew that two adult men, Samuel Stevens, whom the twins referred to as \"Thinman,\" and William Lovick, whom the twins called \"Bobo,\" were living on the third floor of the Sykes residence.<sup>[1]</sup> There were also numerous indications that both men, at various points, were acting as the twins' de facto caretakers.<sup>[2]</sup> Indeed, Stevens <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> was such a regular presence at the Sykes home that Mary Starnes, the assigned DCYF case aide, identified the home with reference to \"Thinman\" in her notes, and she reported numerous interactions with Stevens to defendant Gloria. Stevens also accompanied Gloria to some of the twins' counseling sessions. Defendant Terry was also aware that Stevens and Lovick were involved in the twins' lives.</p>\n<p>DCYF apparently did not ever complete background investigations of either Stevens or Lovick, although DCYF's regulations required the agency to screen any adult resident or regular caretaker in a foster home. <i>See</i> R.I. Dep't of Youth, Children, and Families, State of Rhode Island Foster Care Regulations § II.C, Clearances and Record Checks (1998) [hereinafter \"Foster Care Regulations\"]. Plaintiffs say that Gloria also told Sykes that both Stevens and Lovick could remain in the home and knew that Sykes depended upon them to help supervise the twins.</p>\n<p>Additionally, neither Sykes nor defendants Gloria or Terry ever reported to DCYF's licensing division that these men were residing in the home or that they were acting as caretakers for the twins. DCYF regulations required foster parents to inform the department of any such changes in foster household composition. <i>See</i> Foster Care Regulations §§ V.2; V.Q. In August 1997, DCYF's licensing division nonetheless renewed Sykes's foster home license. Foster home licenses can be revoked if the foster parent fails to notify DCYF of changes in household composition or if the foster parent omits important facts about the foster environment. <i>Id.</i> § III.C.</p>\n<p>There were various Child Abuse and Neglect Tracking System (CANTS) investigations of the twins' care during their eighteen-month stay in the Sykes home. Two of the reports mentioned Lovick but not Stevens. In March 1997, J.R. told DCYF case aide Starnes that \"Bobo\" (Lovick) had hit him, but the twins did not answer further questions, and after further investigation, DCYF deemed the report unfounded. In August 1997, a separate investigation mentioning Lovick was initiated when the twins' counselor noticed J.R. had scratch marks on his head and neck. DCYF determined this report was also unfounded after the twins said these injuries came from fighting with each other. DCYF also made a formal finding that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Lovick was improperly supervising the children.</p>\n<p>There were also several other reported incidents between the spring and fall of 1997 in which the twins exhibited behavioral problems or physical injuries, including bruises. With the exception of the reports discussed above, none of these reports mentioned either Stevens or Lovick. DCYF determined that none of these reports supported a formal finding of likely abuse.</p>\n<p>On May 27, 1998, one of the twins' teachers called the DCYF hotline because she had noticed bruises on their forearms. The twins told a DCYF investigator that the bruises were made when \"Thinman\" (Stevens) hit them with a belt and that he had done this before. This was the first report mentioning Stevens. The investigator took the twins to the hospital and documented their injuries. DCYF also discovered a belt in the Sykes home in the location the twins had described. DCYF permanently removed the twins from the Sykes home that same day. Following an investigation, DCYF determined that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> there was credible evidence of institutional neglect by Sykes and abuse by Stevens.</p>\n<p>In March 1999, some ten months after the twins were removed, the twins' mother and a counselor jointly reported for the first time that B.R. and J.R. had said \"Thinman\" had sexually abused them. DCYF investigated but determined the report was inconsistent and unfounded. Still, we will assume, in plaintiffs' favor, that the report was correct because the harm it alleges is the foundation of their suit. Since the twins left the Sykes foster home in 1998, they have suffered from a number of severe developmental challenges and have required ongoing institutional care.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs originally sued Gloria and Terry for state law negligence claims in Rhode Island state court in 2001, but they amended the complaint to allege constitutional violations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in 2008. Gloria and Terry removed the case to federal court on April 15, 2008. The case proceeded to a jury trial. On November 17, 2008, at the close of plaintiffs' case and after six days of trial during which nineteen witnesses for plaintiffs testified, defendants filed a Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law. They asserted, among other grounds, a qualified immunity defense to the § 1983 claim and immunity to the state law negligence claims based on Rhode Island's state sovereign immunity and state qualified immunity law.</p>\n<p>In a decision and order dated February 26, 2009, the district court entered judgment for the defendants. <i>J.R.,</i> 599 F.Supp.2d at 183. It held that Gloria and Terry were entitled to qualified immunity against the § 1983 claims because plaintiffs' evidence, taking all the inferences in their favor, had not established that there was a substantive due process violation or that such a right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation. <i>Id.</i> at 192-204. It further held that Gloria and Terry were immune from state tort liability for their official conduct because of Rhode Island's state sovereign immunity and that Gloria was entitled to state law qualified immunity from the individual negligence claim. <i>Id.</i> at 204-05.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a grant of judgment under Rule 50(a). <i>See </i><i>Hatfield-Bermudez v. Aldanondo-Rivera,</i> 496 F.3d 51, 59 (1st Cir.2007). We review the district court's underlying legal conclusions de novo and take the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <i>See id.</i> at 61.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Federal Constitutional Claims under § 1983</h2>\n<p>Officials are entitled to qualified immunity against claims of federal constitutional violations unless (1) \"the facts that a plaintiff has alleged or shown make out a violation of a constitutional right\" and (2) \"the right at issue was `clearly established' at the time of defendant's alleged misconduct.\" <i>Pearson v. Callahan,</i> ___ U.S. ___, ___, 129 S.Ct. 808, 816, 172 L.Ed.2d 565 (2009) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The district court held that plaintiffs' case failed on both grounds. On appeal, plaintiffs challenge the district court's ruling that Gloria and Terry were entitled to qualified immunity because, inter alia, plaintiffs had not put forward evidence that could establish the first prong, that there was a substantive due process violation.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' substantive due process theory turns upon Gloria's and Terry's alleged failures to protect the twins from the risks present in their foster home. Plaintiffs argue that Gloria and Terry knew that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> twins were regularly being cared for by two unknown, uninvestigated adult male residents, Samuel \"Thinman\" Stevens and William \"Bobo\" Lovick. They also say that the number of DCYF investigations before May 1998 should have alerted Gloria and Terry to the possibility of abuse in the home.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs further argue that defendants were \"deliberately indifferent\" to these apparent risks because they failed to conduct background checks on Stevens and Lovick, did not report these changes in household composition, and failed to maintain regular, direct contact with the twins, even though, plaintiffs say, DCYF regulations required these steps to be taken. Had defendants told DCYF's licensing unit about Stevens's and Lovick's unreported presence in the home, plaintiffs say DCYF would have revoked the foster license. Plaintiffs theorize that if the license had been revoked, the boys would have been removed and they would not have been harmed.</p>\n<p>We reject plaintiffs' argument and affirm the district court's holding that Gloria and Terry were entitled to qualified immunity because plaintiffs failed to establish on the facts that there was a substantive due process violation. We need not address whether any such \"right\" would have been clearly established at the time of the alleged violation, <i>Saucier v. Katz,</i> 533 U.S. 194, 201, 121 S.Ct. 2151, 150 L.Ed.2d 272 (2001), though we note that plaintiffs did not challenge the district court's holding on this issue.</p>\n<p>A Due Process Clause claim requires that there be a deprivation of life, liberty, or property by the government. Here, the deprivations alleged were by private parties. \"As a general matter ... a State's failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause,\" unless the government is responsible for the deprivation. <i>DeShaney v. Winnebago County Dep't of Soc. Servs.,</i> 489 U.S. 189, 197, 199-200, 109 S.Ct. 998, 103 L.Ed.2d 249 (1989). There is no claim that the state officials here actively directed or assisted private actors in causing harm.</p>\n<p>We have, under some language in <i>DeShaney,</i> posited that in situations where a state creates a \"special relationship\" because of \"the limitation which [the state] has imposed on [an individual's] freedom to act on his own behalf,\" its subsequent failure to protect an individual may amount to a substantive due process violation. <i>Rivera v. Rhode Island,</i> 402 F.3d 27, 34 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>DeShaney,</i> 489 U.S. at 200, 109 S.Ct. 998). That affirmative duty to protect does not arise from the state's knowledge of the individual's predicament or from its expression of intent to help him, but instead from the limitation described.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The mere creation of a special relationship, even if placing young children into foster care created such a relationship, is not enough to make out a due process claim for any harm that may follow. Even then, the claim against the defendants must also involve \"conscience-shocking\" conduct by state officials, <i>see id.</i> at 35-36, and \"the official conduct `most likely to rise to the conscience-shocking level' is the `conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest.'\" <i>Chavez v. Martinez,</i> 538 U.S. 760, 775, 123 S.Ct. 1994, 155 L.Ed.2d 984 (2003) (quoting <i>County of Sacramento v.</i> <span class=\"star-pagination\">*80</span> <i>Lewis,</i> 523 U.S. 833, 849, 118 S.Ct. 1708, 140 L.Ed.2d 1043 (1998)). The Supreme Court has also repeatedly \"expressed [its] reluctance to expand the doctrine of substantive due process.\" <i>Id.; see also </i><i>Maldonado v. Fontanes,</i> 568 F.3d 263, 273 (1st Cir.2009). In particular, the Court has made it clear that state officials' negligence, without more, is simply insufficient to meet the conscience-shocking standard. <i>See </i><i>Lewis,</i> 523 U.S. at 848-49, 118 S.Ct. 1708.</p>\n<p>We assume arguendo that DCYF created a \"special relationship\" because it affirmatively took responsibility for protecting the twins from harm while they remained in foster care. Even so, plaintiffs, on all of their evidence, did not make out a substantive due process claim. The evidence they put forward alleges troubling lapses in DCYF's supervision of the twins' foster care environment. But it does not allege any behavior by defendants that would meet the legal definition of conscience-shocking conduct.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that the legal standard for defining conduct that \"shocks the conscience\" is whether the state has acted with \"deliberate indifference.\" That is not entirely correct. As we stated in <i>Rivera,</i> deliberately indifferent behavior does not per se shock the conscience. Indeed, we suggested that it is only \"[i]n situations where actors have an opportunity to reflect and make reasoned and rational decisions\" that \"deliberately indifferent behavior <i>may</i> suffice to shock the conscience.\" 402 F.3d at 36.<sup>[4]</sup> The burden to show state conduct that \"shocks the conscience\" is extremely high, requiring \"stunning\" evidence of \"arbitrariness and caprice\" that extends beyond \"[m]ere violations of state law, even violations resulting from bad faith\" to \"something more egregious and more extreme.\" <i>DePoutot v. Raffaelly,</i> 424 F.3d 112, 119 (1st Cir. 2005). Gloria and Terry do not defend their actions on the basis that they were responding to an emergency, with no time to reflect, but on the basis that even if their conduct fell short of regulatory requirements, it did not come close to shocking the conscience.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' evidence did not show the defendants acted even with deliberate indifference. Though other circuits have varied in their formulations of when \"deliberate indifference\" rises to conscience-shocking conduct in the foster care context, state officials must have been at least aware of known or likely injuries or abuse and have chosen to ignore the danger to the child. <i>See </i><i>Nicini v. Morra,</i> 212 F.3d 798, 810 (3d Cir.2000) (listing cases); <i>see also </i><i>Waubanascum v. Shawano County,</i> 416 F.3d 658, 666-67 (7th Cir.2005) (holding that plaintiffs must present evidence that \"the state actor knows or suspects that the ... foster parents with whom a child is placed are likely to abuse the child\" to show deliberate indifference).</p>\n<p>Even when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, no rational trier of fact could conclude that the defendants were aware that the twins were in danger of being abused or otherwise harmed by Stevens. Even if Gloria and Terry knew that Stevens and Lovick were living in and caring for the twins in the Sykes home, Gloria and Terry had no reason on that basis to identify them as a risk to the children. Plaintiffs have never asserted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> that Lovick was responsible for any of the harms they claim. Previous reported incidents were investigated by DCYF and deemed not credible. Further, the reports contained no indication that Stevens was in any way involved.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs also argue that the various reported incidents should be viewed in the aggregate as general warning signs of abuse in the home. But these reports were all deemed unfounded until the May 1998 incident that resulted in the twins' removal. Moreover, Gloria's uncontested testimony indicated that DCYF social workers were not ordinarily given much information about unfounded CANTS reports. And there were no reports of suspected abuse, no indications of any injuries, and no reported behavioral problems between September 1997 and May 1998, which undercuts plaintiffs' theory of escalating warning signs.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, there is no evidence that defendants made a reasoned decision to deliberately ignore the risk of harm to the twins in the course of supervising the twins' foster care placement. The defendants' failure to conduct background checks on Stevens and Lovick and to report their residency at the Sykes home were, at worst, possible violations of state law.<sup>[5]</sup> That failure does not amount to inherently egregious conduct. Plaintiffs' contention that the twins would not have been abused if DCYF had rescinded the Sykes's foster home license or removed them from the Sykes home at an earlier stage is an argument about \"but for\" causation, but not about the defendants' intentions or actions.</p>\n<p>The defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. The supervisory liability claim against Terry necessarily fails as well. <i>See </i><i>Rivera,</i> 402 F.3d at 38-39.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. State Law Claims</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs also brought negligence claims under Rhode Island tort law against Gloria and Terry in their official capacities and against Gloria in her individual capacity. We hold, as did the district court, that all of these claims are barred by Rhode Island state law immunity doctrines.</p>\n<p>Under Rhode Island law, state sovereign immunity is waived and state entities and their official representatives can be sued for torts only if (1) the state entity has a \"special duty\" to the plaintiffs, (2) the state entity has engaged in an \"egregious\" alleged act or omission, or (3) the state entity was engaging in the kind of actions that private parties normally perform. <i>See </i><i>Kuzniar v. Keach,</i> 709 A.2d 1050, 1053 (R.I.1998); <i>see also</i> R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1. We reject plaintiffs' argument on appeal that the \"special duty\" exception applied and allowed suit against Gloria and Terry in their official capacities.</p>\n<p>The \"special duty\" exception applies only if (1) state officials were aware of plaintiffs or their situation, (2) the officials \"acted or failed to act in some way that was potentially injurious\" to plaintiffs, and (3) it was \"reasonably foreseeable\" that plaintiffs' injuries would result from these acts or omissions. <i>Morales v. Town of Johnston,</i> 895 A.2d 721, 731 (R.I.2006).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> Plaintiffs argue that the district court should have found this \"special duty\" exception applicable given the court's conclusions in its substantive due process analysis that defendants had a \"special relationship\" with plaintiffs and that plaintiffs' evidence might suffice to show negligence.</p>\n<p>This argument ignores the district court's finding that there was no evidence presented to show that defendants had any \"actual knowledge of a substantial risk of harm.\" Nor did plaintiffs present evidence showing that defendants could have reasonably foreseen that either Stevens or Lovick were likely to abuse the children. Plaintiffs' failure to present such evidence means that they cannot satisfy the third prong of this test. Gloria and Terry remain entitled to immunity for the negligence claims brought against them in their official capacities. <i>See </i><i>Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman,</i> 465 U.S. 89, 99-100, 106, 104 S.Ct. 900, 79 L.Ed.2d 67 (1984) (holding that barring waiver by the state, the Eleventh Amendment precludes federal courts from hearing state claims brought against state officials in their official capacities).</p>\n<p>Finally, as the district court held, Gloria is entitled to qualified immunity against the state law negligence claims made against her individually. Rhode Island law allows state officials like Gloria to invoke qualified immunity against state law negligence claims. <i>See </i><i>Hatch v. Town of Middletown,</i> 311 F.3d 83, 90 (1st Cir.2002). Plaintiffs seem to suggest to the contrary, but their argument conflates Rhode Island's waiver of state sovereign immunity under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1 in suits against state officials in their <i>official</i> capacities with defendants' entitlement to qualified immunity for suits brought against them in their <i>individual</i> capacities. Any challenge to the merits of the district court's qualified immunity ruling is waived.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs have made serious allegations about shortcomings in DCYF's monitoring of the twins' foster care placement in the Sykes home. But their remedy is not in court.</p>\n<p>We <i>affirm</i> the district court's grant of judgment as a matter of law to the defendants under Rule 50(a).</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For the purposes of this opinion, we will refer to the men by their last names as \"Stevens\" and \"Lovick.\" William Lovick is also referred to as \"Lovikk\" and \"Lovett\" in the records.</p>\n<p>[2]  Plaintiffs do not allege that Lovick was responsible for the abuse they say occurred in the Sykes home. Rather, they portray his ongoing presence in the home without any background investigation as evidence of DCYF's lax supervision of the twins' foster care environment.</p>\n<p>[3]  This case does not involve the state-created danger theory, which this circuit has never, in any event, found applicable. <i>See </i><i>Véléz-Diaz v. Vega-Irizarry,</i> 421 F.3d 71, 80 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p>[4]  This circuit has never found on the facts of a case that deliberately indifferent behavior was sufficiently conscience-shocking to violate a plaintiff's substantive due process rights. <i>Rivera</i> merely suggested that under certain circumstances, deliberately indifferent behavior could conceivably qualify. 402 F.3d at 36; <i>see also </i><i>Ramos-Pinero v. Puerto Rico,</i> 453 F.3d 48, 53 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>[5]  Because we are reviewing a Rule 50(a) motion, we accept plaintiffs' version of the facts surrounding the background checks. However, we note, as the district court observed, that defendants vigorously contested plaintiffs' claim that DCYF never conducted a state background check on Stevens. DCYF officials testified that they did conduct a background check on Stevens through the Rhode Island Attorney General's Office, that no red flags appeared in it, and that this information was verbally conveyed to DCYF. <i>See </i><i>J.R.,</i> 599 F.Supp.2d at 197 n. 20.</p>\n\n</div>",

Gloria,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"1898181\"><a href=\"/opinion/1898181/jr-v-gloria/\"><span class=\"volume\">599</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">182</span></a></span>, 205 (D.R.I.2009).</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs J.R. and B.R., twin boys and minors, and their mother, Molly Raymond, brought substantive due process claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state law claims under Rhode Island negligence law for damages against the two state DCYF officials. Plaintiffs allege that when the twins were living in foster care between November 1996 and May 1998, from the ages of four to five, they were physically and sexually abused by Samuel \"Thinman\" Stevens, who they say lived in the foster home and acted as the twins' de facto caretaker. They claim this abuse resulted from defendants' actionable failures to comply with state law requirements.</p>\n<p>The question before us is whether the court erred in granting defendants immunity from the federal and state law claims at issue. We hold that the district court properly granted defendants qualified immunity on the § 1983 action and judgment for defendants on state sovereign immunity and qualified immunity defenses under Rhode Island state law. This case also demonstrates the adage that claims based on possible violations of state laws do not necessarily make out claims of violations of federal due process guarantees.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>I.</h2>\n<p>Because this is an appeal from a grant of a Rule 50(a) motion, we recount the facts in the light most favorable to plaintiffs. <i>See </i><i>Philip v. Cronin,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"203471\"><a href=\"/opinion/203471/philip-v-cronin/\"><span class=\"volume\">537</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">26</span></a></span>, 32 (1st Cir.2008); <i>see also </i><i>Jennings v.

Neither defendant had a role in the placement decision. There is no claim that the twins should not have been placed in foster care or that the initial placement in the Sykes home was inappropriate. Rather, plaintiffs' case turns upon defendants' alleged failure to investigate and prevent the events that are alleged to have occurred during this placement.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs claim that from the time the twins were placed in the Sykes home in November 1996 until they were removed in May 1998, defendant Gloria and others in DCYF knew that two adult men, Samuel Stevens, whom the twins referred to as \"Thinman,\" and William Lovick, whom the twins called \"Bobo,\" were living on the third floor of the Sykes residence.<sup>[1]</sup> There were also numerous indications that both men, at various points, were acting as the twins' de facto caretakers.<sup>[2]</sup> Indeed, Stevens <span class=\"star-pagination\">*77</span> was such a regular presence at the Sykes home that Mary Starnes, the assigned DCYF case aide, identified the home with reference to \"Thinman\" in her notes, and she reported numerous interactions with Stevens to defendant Gloria. Stevens also accompanied Gloria to some of the twins' counseling sessions. Defendant Terry was also aware that Stevens and Lovick were involved in the twins' lives.</p>\n<p>DCYF apparently did not ever complete background investigations of either Stevens or Lovick, although DCYF's regulations required the agency to screen any adult resident or regular caretaker in a foster home. <i>See</i> R.I. Dep't of Youth, Children, and Families, State of Rhode Island Foster Care Regulations § II.C, Clearances and Record Checks (1998) [hereinafter \"Foster Care Regulations\"]. Plaintiffs say that Gloria also told Sykes that both Stevens and Lovick could remain in the home and knew that Sykes depended upon them to help supervise the twins.</p>\n<p>Additionally, neither Sykes nor defendants Gloria or Terry ever reported to DCYF's licensing division that these men were residing in the home or that they were acting as caretakers for the twins. DCYF regulations required foster parents to inform the department of any such changes in foster household composition. <i>See</i> Foster Care Regulations §§ V.2; V.Q. In August 1997, DCYF's licensing division nonetheless renewed Sykes's foster home license. Foster home licenses can be revoked if the foster parent fails to notify DCYF of changes in household composition or if the foster parent omits important facts about the foster environment. <i>Id.</i> § III.C.</p>\n<p>There were various Child Abuse and Neglect Tracking System (CANTS) investigations of the twins' care during their eighteen-month stay in the Sykes home. Two of the reports mentioned Lovick but not Stevens. In March 1997, J.R. told DCYF case aide Starnes that \"Bobo\" (Lovick) had hit him, but the twins did not answer further questions, and after further investigation, DCYF deemed the report unfounded. In August 1997, a separate investigation mentioning Lovick was initiated when the twins' counselor noticed J.R. had scratch marks on his head and neck. DCYF determined this report was also unfounded after the twins said these injuries came from fighting with each other. DCYF also made a formal finding that there was insufficient evidence to conclude that Lovick was improperly supervising the children.</p>\n<p>There were also several other reported incidents between the spring and fall of 1997 in which the twins exhibited behavioral problems or physical injuries, including bruises. With the exception of the reports discussed above, none of these reports mentioned either Stevens or Lovick. DCYF determined that none of these reports supported a formal finding of likely abuse.</p>\n<p>On May 27, 1998, one of the twins' teachers called the DCYF hotline because she had noticed bruises on their forearms. The twins told a DCYF investigator that the bruises were made when \"Thinman\" (Stevens) hit them with a belt and that he had done this before. This was the first report mentioning Stevens. The investigator took the twins to the hospital and documented their injuries. DCYF also discovered a belt in the Sykes home in the location the twins had described. DCYF permanently removed the twins from the Sykes home that same day. Following an investigation, DCYF determined that <span class=\"star-pagination\">*78</span> there was credible evidence of institutional neglect by Sykes and abuse by Stevens.</p>\n<p>In March 1999, some ten months after the twins were removed, the twins' mother and a counselor jointly reported for the first time that B.R. and J.R. had said \"Thinman\" had sexually abused them. DCYF investigated but determined the report was inconsistent and unfounded. Still, we will assume, in plaintiffs' favor, that the report was correct because the harm it alleges is the foundation of their suit. Since the twins left the Sykes foster home in 1998, they have suffered from a number of severe developmental challenges and have required ongoing institutional care.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs originally sued Gloria and Terry for state law negligence claims in Rhode Island state court in 2001, but they amended the complaint to allege constitutional violations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in 2008. Gloria and Terry removed the case to federal court on April 15, 2008. The case proceeded to a jury trial. On November 17, 2008, at the close of plaintiffs' case and after six days of trial during which nineteen witnesses for plaintiffs testified, defendants filed a Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law. They asserted, among other grounds, a qualified immunity defense to the § 1983 claim and immunity to the state law negligence claims based on Rhode Island's state sovereign immunity and state qualified immunity law.</p>\n<p>In a decision and order dated February 26, 2009, the district court entered judgment for the defendants. <i>J.R.,</i> 599 F.Supp.2d at 183. It held that Gloria and Terry were entitled to qualified immunity against the § 1983 claims because plaintiffs' evidence, taking all the inferences in their favor, had not established that there was a substantive due process violation or that such a right was clearly established at the time of the alleged violation. <i>Id.</i> at 192-204. It further held that Gloria and Terry were immune from state tort liability for their official conduct because of Rhode Island's state sovereign immunity and that Gloria was entitled to state law qualified immunity from the individual negligence claim. <i>Id.</i> at 204-05.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>II.</h2>\n<p>We review de novo a grant of judgment under Rule 50(a). <i>See </i><i>Hatfield-Bermudez v.

We review the district court's underlying legal conclusions de novo and take the evidence in the light most favorable to the plaintiffs. <i>See id.</i> at 61.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>A. Federal Constitutional Claims under § 1983</h2>\n<p>Officials are entitled to qualified immunity against claims of federal constitutional violations unless (1) \"the facts that a plaintiff has alleged or shown make out a violation of a constitutional right\" and (2) \"the right at issue was `clearly established' at the time of defendant's alleged misconduct.\" <i>Pearson v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></a></span> (2009) (internal citations omitted).</p>\n<p>The district court held that plaintiffs' case failed on both grounds. On appeal, plaintiffs challenge the district court's ruling that Gloria and Terry were entitled to qualified immunity because, inter alia, plaintiffs had not put forward evidence that could establish the first prong, that there was a substantive due process violation.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' substantive due process theory turns upon Gloria's and Terry's alleged failures to protect the twins from the risks present in their foster home. Plaintiffs argue that Gloria and Terry knew that the <span class=\"star-pagination\">*79</span> twins were regularly being cared for by two unknown, uninvestigated adult male residents, Samuel \"Thinman\" Stevens and William \"Bobo\" Lovick. They also say that the number of DCYF investigations before May 1998 should have alerted Gloria and Terry to the possibility of abuse in the home.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs further argue that defendants were \"deliberately indifferent\" to these apparent risks because they failed to conduct background checks on Stevens and Lovick, did not report these changes in household composition, and failed to maintain regular, direct contact with the twins, even though, plaintiffs say, DCYF regulations required these steps to be taken. Had defendants told DCYF's licensing unit about Stevens's and Lovick's unreported presence in the home, plaintiffs say DCYF would have revoked the foster license. Plaintiffs theorize that if the license had been revoked, the boys would have been removed and they would not have been harmed.</p>\n<p>We reject plaintiffs' argument and affirm the district court's holding that Gloria and Terry were entitled to qualified immunity because plaintiffs failed to establish on the facts that there was a substantive due process violation. We need not address whether any such \"right\" would have been clearly established at the time of the alleged violation, <i>Saucier v.

Here, the deprivations alleged were by private parties. \"As a general matter ... a State's failure to protect an individual against private violence simply does not constitute a violation of the Due Process Clause,\" unless the government is responsible for the deprivation. <i>DeShaney v.

There is no claim that the state officials here actively directed or assisted private actors in causing harm.</p>\n<p>We have, under some language in <i>DeShaney,</i> posited that in situations where a state creates a \"special relationship\" because of \"the limitation which [the state] has imposed on [an individual's] freedom to act on his own behalf,\" its subsequent failure to protect an individual may amount to a substantive due process violation. <i>Rivera v. Rhode Island,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201493\"><a href=\"/opinion/201493/rivera-v-state-of-ri/\"><span class=\"volume\">402</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">27</span></a></span>, 34 (1st Cir.2005) (quoting <i>DeShaney,</i> 489 U.S. at 200, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112202\"><a href=\"/opinion/112202/deshaney-v-winnebago-county-dept-of-social-servs/\"><span class=\"volume\">109</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

That affirmative duty to protect does not arise from the state's knowledge of the individual's predicament or from its expression of intent to help him, but instead from the limitation described.<sup>[3]</sup></p>\n<p>The mere creation of a special relationship, even if placing young children into foster care created such a relationship, is not enough to make out a due process claim for any harm that may follow. Even then, the claim against the defendants must also involve \"conscience-shocking\" conduct by state officials, <i>see id.</i> at 35-36, and \"the official conduct `most likely to rise to the conscience-shocking level' is the `conduct intended to injure in some way unjustifiable by any government interest.'\" <i>Chavez v.

In particular, the Court has made it clear that state officials' negligence, without more, is simply insufficient to meet the conscience-shocking standard. <i>See </i><i>Lewis,</i> 523 U.S. at 848-49, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118214\"><a href=\"/opinion/118214/countyof-sacramento-v-lewis/\"><span class=\"volume\">118</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1708</span></a></span>.</p>\n<p>We assume arguendo that DCYF created a \"special relationship\" because it affirmatively took responsibility for protecting the twins from harm while they remained in foster care. Even so, plaintiffs, on all of their evidence, did not make out a substantive due process claim. The evidence they put forward alleges troubling lapses in DCYF's supervision of the twins' foster care environment. But it does not allege any behavior by defendants that would meet the legal definition of conscience-shocking conduct.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs argue that the legal standard for defining conduct that \"shocks the conscience\" is whether the state has acted with \"deliberate indifference.\" That is not entirely correct. As we stated in <i>Rivera,</i> deliberately indifferent behavior does not per se shock the conscience. Indeed, we suggested that it is only \"[i]n situations where actors have an opportunity to reflect and make reasoned and rational decisions\" that \"deliberately indifferent behavior <i>may</i> suffice to shock the conscience.\" 402 F.3d at 36.<sup>[4]</sup> The burden to show state conduct that \"shocks the conscience\" is extremely high, requiring \"stunning\" evidence of \"arbitrariness and caprice\" that extends beyond \"[m]ere violations of state law, even violations resulting from bad faith\" to \"something more egregious and more extreme.\" <i>DePoutot v. Raffaelly,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201841\"><a href=\"/opinion/201841/depoutot-v-raffaelly/\"><span class=\"volume\">424</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">112</span></a></span>, 119 (1st Cir. 2005). Gloria and Terry do not defend their actions on the basis that they were responding to an emergency, with no time to reflect, but on the basis that even if their conduct fell short of regulatory requirements, it did not come close to shocking the conscience.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs' evidence did not show the defendants acted even with deliberate indifference. Though other circuits have varied in their formulations of when \"deliberate indifference\" rises to conscience-shocking conduct in the foster care context, state officials must have been at least aware of known or likely injuries or abuse and have chosen to ignore the danger to the child. <i>See </i><i>Nicini v. Morra,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"768726\"><a href=\"/opinion/768726/anthony-nicini-jr-v-edward-morra-new-jersey-department-of-health-and/\"><span class=\"volume\">212</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">798</span></a></span>, 810 (3d Cir.2000) (listing cases); <i>see also </i><i>Waubanascum v. Shawano County,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"791184\"><a href=\"/opinion/791184/nahquaseh-b-waubanascum-v-shawano-county/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">658</span></a></span>, 666-67 (7th Cir.2005) (holding that plaintiffs must present evidence that \"the state actor knows or suspects that the ... foster parents with whom a child is placed are likely to abuse the child\" to show deliberate indifference).</p>\n<p>Even when the evidence is viewed in the light most favorable to plaintiffs, no rational trier of fact could conclude that the defendants were aware that the twins were in danger of being abused or otherwise harmed by Stevens. Even if Gloria and Terry knew that Stevens and Lovick were living in and caring for the twins in the Sykes home, Gloria and Terry had no reason on that basis to identify them as a risk to the children. Plaintiffs have never asserted <span class=\"star-pagination\">*81</span> that Lovick was responsible for any of the harms they claim. Previous reported incidents were investigated by DCYF and deemed not credible. Further, the reports contained no indication that Stevens was in any way involved.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs also argue that the various reported incidents should be viewed in the aggregate as general warning signs of abuse in the home. But these reports were all deemed unfounded until the May 1998 incident that resulted in the twins' removal. Moreover, Gloria's uncontested testimony indicated that DCYF social workers were not ordinarily given much information about unfounded CANTS reports. And there were no reports of suspected abuse, no indications of any injuries, and no reported behavioral problems between September 1997 and May 1998, which undercuts plaintiffs' theory of escalating warning signs.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, there is no evidence that defendants made a reasoned decision to deliberately ignore the risk of harm to the twins in the course of supervising the twins' foster care placement. The defendants' failure to conduct background checks on Stevens and Lovick and to report their residency at the Sykes home were, at worst, possible violations of state law.<sup>[5]</sup> That failure does not amount to inherently egregious conduct. Plaintiffs' contention that the twins would not have been abused if DCYF had rescinded the Sykes's foster home license or removed them from the Sykes home at an earlier stage is an argument about \"but for\" causation, but not about the defendants' intentions or actions.</p>\n<p>The defendants are entitled to qualified immunity. The supervisory liability claim against Terry necessarily fails as well. <i>See </i><i>Rivera,</i> 402 F.3d at 38-39.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>B. State Law Claims</h2>\n<p>Plaintiffs also brought negligence claims under Rhode Island tort law against Gloria and Terry in their official capacities and against Gloria in her individual capacity. We hold, as did the district court, that all of these claims are barred by Rhode Island state law immunity doctrines.</p>\n<p>Under Rhode Island law, state sovereign immunity is waived and state entities and their official representatives can be sued for torts only if (1) the state entity has a \"special duty\" to the plaintiffs, (2) the state entity has engaged in an \"egregious\" alleged act or omission, or (3) the state entity was engaging in the kind of actions that private parties normally perform. <i>See </i><i>Kuzniar v. Keach,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2071056\"><a href=\"/opinion/2071056/kuzniar-v-keach/\"><span class=\"volume\">709</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1050</span></a></span>, 1053 (R.I.1998); <i>see also</i> R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1. We reject plaintiffs' argument on appeal that the \"special duty\" exception applied and allowed suit against Gloria and Terry in their official capacities.</p>\n<p>The \"special duty\" exception applies only if (1) state officials were aware of plaintiffs or their situation, (2) the officials \"acted or failed to act in some way that was potentially injurious\" to plaintiffs, and (3) it was \"reasonably foreseeable\" that plaintiffs' injuries would result from these acts or omissions. <i>Morales v. Town of Johnston,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2058115\"><a href=\"/opinion/2058115/morales-v-town-of-johnston/\"><span class=\"volume\">895</span> <span class=\"reporter\">A.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">721</span></a></span>, 731 (R.I.2006).</p>\n<p><span class=\"star-pagination\">*82</span> Plaintiffs argue that the district court should have found this \"special duty\" exception applicable given the court's conclusions in its substantive due process analysis that defendants had a \"special relationship\" with plaintiffs and that plaintiffs' evidence might suffice to show negligence.</p>\n<p>This argument ignores the district court's finding that there was no evidence presented to show that defendants had any \"actual knowledge of a substantial risk of harm.\" Nor did plaintiffs present evidence showing that defendants could have reasonably foreseen that either Stevens or Lovick were likely to abuse the children. Plaintiffs' failure to present such evidence means that they cannot satisfy the third prong of this test. Gloria and Terry remain entitled to immunity for the negligence claims brought against them in their official capacities. <i>See </i><i>Pennhurst State Sch. &amp; Hosp. v. Halderman,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111094\"><a href=\"/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">465</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">89</span></a></span>, 99-100, 106, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111094\"><a href=\"/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">104</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">900</span></a></span>, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"111094\"><a href=\"/opinion/111094/pennhurst-state-school-and-hospital-v-halderman/\"><span class=\"volume\">79</span> <span class=\"reporter\">L. Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">67</span></a></span> (1984) (holding that barring waiver by the state, the Eleventh Amendment precludes federal courts from hearing state claims brought against state officials in their official capacities).</p>\n<p>Finally, as the district court held, Gloria is entitled to qualified immunity against the state law negligence claims made against her individually. Rhode Island law allows state officials like Gloria to invoke qualified immunity against state law negligence claims. <i>See </i><i>Hatch v. Town of Middletown,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"200211\"><a href=\"/opinion/200211/hatch-v-middletown-ri/\"><span class=\"volume\">311</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">83</span></a></span>, 90 (1st Cir.2002). Plaintiffs seem to suggest to the contrary, but their argument conflates Rhode Island's waiver of state sovereign immunity under R.I. Gen. Laws § 9-31-1 in suits against state officials in their <i>official</i> capacities with defendants' entitlement to qualified immunity for suits brought against them in their <i>individual</i> capacities. Any challenge to the merits of the district court's qualified immunity ruling is waived.</p>\n<p>Plaintiffs have made serious allegations about shortcomings in DCYF's monitoring of the twins' foster care placement in the Sykes home. But their remedy is not in court.</p>\n<p>We <i>affirm</i> the district court's grant of judgment as a matter of law to the defendants under Rule 50(a).</p>\n<p><i>So ordered.</i></p>\n<h2>NOTES</h2>\n<p>[1]  For the purposes of this opinion, we will refer to the men by their last names as \"Stevens\" and \"Lovick.\" William Lovick is also referred to as \"Lovikk\" and \"Lovett\" in the records.</p>\n<p>[2]  Plaintiffs do not allege that Lovick was responsible for the abuse they say occurred in the Sykes home. Rather, they portray his ongoing presence in the home without any background investigation as evidence of DCYF's lax supervision of the twins' foster care environment.</p>\n<p>[3]  This case does not involve the state-created danger theory, which this circuit has never, in any event, found applicable. <i>See </i><i>Véléz-Diaz v. Vega-Irizarry,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201798\"><a href=\"/opinion/201798/velez-diaz-v-vega-irizarry/\"><span class=\"volume\">421</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">71</span></a></span>, 80 (1st Cir. 2005).</p>\n<p>[4]  This circuit has never found on the facts of a case that deliberately indifferent behavior was sufficiently conscience-shocking to violate a plaintiff's substantive due process rights. <i>Rivera</i> merely suggested that under certain circumstances, deliberately indifferent behavior could conceivably qualify. 402 F.3d at 36; <i>see also </i><i>Ramos-Pinero v. Puerto Rico,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202296\"><a href=\"/opinion/202296/ramos-pinero-v-commonweath-of-pr/\"><span class=\"volume\">453</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">48</span></a></span>, 53 (1st Cir.2006).</p>\n<p>[5]  Because we are reviewing a Rule 50(a) motion, we accept plaintiffs' version of the facts surrounding the background checks. However, we note, as the district court observed, that defendants vigorously contested plaintiffs' claim that DCYF never conducted a state background check on Stevens. DCYF officials testified that they did conduct a background check on Stevens through the Rhode Island Attorney General's Office, that no red flags appeared in it, and that this information was verbally conveyed to DCYF. <i>See </i><i>J.R.,</i> 599 F.Supp.2d at 197 n. 20.</p>\n\n</div>",
