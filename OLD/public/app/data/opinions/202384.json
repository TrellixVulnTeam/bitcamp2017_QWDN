Merssi Heydemans seeks review of a Board of\n\nImmigration     Appeals   (BIA)   order    affirming    a    decision   by    an\n\nimmigration judge (IJ) that found him ineligible to apply for\n\nasylum and denied his application for withholding of removal and\n\nprotection under the Convention Against Torture. For the following\n\nreasons, we deny his petition for review.\n\n           1. We lack jurisdiction to review the IJ's determination\n\nthat Heydemans is ineligible for asylum because his application\n\nseeking   asylum   was    untimely   and   he   did    not   qualify    for   an\n\nexception. Hayek v. Gonzales, 445 F.3d 501, 506-07 (1st Cir. 2006)\n\n(per curiam).\n\n           2.    In its decision dated September 15, 2005, the BIA\n\nadopted and affirmed the IJ's decision dated April 14, 2004, and so\n\nwe review the reasoning in the IJ's decision.           Id. at 506.     The IJ\n\nrelied on the correct legal standards, and substantial evidence of\n\nrecord supports her decision (she described that evidence in her\n\ndecision, and we do not repeat it here). Accordingly, the decision\n\nto deny the application for withholding of removal and protection\n\nunder the Convention Against Torture must be upheld. Cf. Nikijuluw\n\nv. Gonzalez, 427 F.3d 115, 122 (1st Cir. 2005) (sustaining the\n\ndenial of an asylum claim by an Indonesian Christian whose church\n\nhad been burned down because his church was being rebuilt, his\n\nChristian family members continued to live safely in Indonesia, and\n\n\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fthe   country   conditions   report   confirmed   that    anti-Christian\n\nviolence had declined significantly).\n\n           3.    Heydemans   offers   new   materials    to   support   his\n\npetition, but we may not consider them because our review is\n\nlimited to the materials in the appellate record.         See 8 U.S.C. ยง\n\n1252(b)(4)(A).\n\n           The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n                                  -3-\n\f",
