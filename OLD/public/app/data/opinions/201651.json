William E. Smith, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                              Before\n\n                      Torruella, Circuit Judge,\n                    Hill,* Senior Circuit Judge,\n                     and Howard, Circuit Judge.\n\n\n     Judith H. Mizner, Assistant Federal Public Defender, on brief,\nfor appellant.\n     Donald C. Lockhart, Assistant United States Attorney, with\nwhom Robert Clark Corrente, United States Attorney, and Adi\nGoldstein, Assistant United States Attorney, were on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                           June 23, 2005\n\n\n\n\n*\n    Of the Eleventh Circuit, sitting by designation.\n\f            Per Curiam.   Arthur D’Amario, III, appeals the district\n\ncourt’s modification of the conditions of his supervised release,\n\ncontending that the court was without jurisdiction to enter such an\n\norder.    Subsequent to the modification and appeal, D’Amario was\n\ncharged with violating the modified conditions and a revocation\n\nproceeding was scheduled for June 8, 2005, the same day on which we\n\nheard oral argument on this appeal of the modification.            At oral\n\nargument, we asked the government to report the outcome of the\n\nsupervised release revocation hearing. The next day, June 9, 2005,\n\nthe government filed an “Emergency Motion for Expedited Decision,”\n\nnotifying the court that the district court found that D’Amario had\n\nviolated the modified conditions, revoked his supervised release,\n\nsentenced him to a year in prison, and imposed a new term of\n\nsupervised release.     The district court, however, recognizing that\n\nits ruling was contingent upon having the jurisdiction both to\n\nmodify the terms of release as well as to revoke the release, made\n\nits ruling provisional, and ordered the parties to brief the issue\n\nso that it might decide it.          The government, in its emergency\n\nmotion, suggests that an expedited resolution of this appeal,\n\nincluding the jurisdictional issue, would best serve both the\n\ninterests of justice and judicial economy.         We agree.\n\n                                     I.\n\n            D’Amario argues that the appeal of the 2003 district\n\ncourt    judgment   revoking   his   supervised   release,   in   which   he\n\n\n                                     -2-\n\fchallenges the validity of the imposition of special conditions of\n\nsupervised release, divests the district court of jurisdiction to\n\nalter any aspect of his supervised release.       He contends that once\n\nhe filed that notice of appeal, all jurisdiction over the case was\n\ntransferred to the appellate court and the district court lost the\n\nauthority to modify in any way the conditions it imposed prior to\n\nthat appeal.     We disagree.\n\n            Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(2) and Fed. R. Crim. P.\n\nRule 32.1 (c), the district court has plenary jurisdiction to\n\nsupervise    a    convicted     defendant’s   release,   including   the\n\njurisdiction to modify the conditions of supervised release, even\n\nthough an appeal from a revocation of supervised release may be\n\npending.    The statute authorizes the district court to make such\n\nmodifications throughout the entire period of supervised release,\n\nirrespective of any appeal. The statute provides that the district\n\ncourt “may modify, reduce, or enlarge the conditions of supervised\n\nrelease, at any time prior to the expiration or termination of the\n\nterm of supervised release.”         18 U.S.C. § 3583(e)(2) (emphasis\n\nadded). Thus, Congress has expressly authorized the district court\n\nto retain jurisdiction over and supervise the release of convicted\n\ndefendants, including during the pendency of their appeals.\n\n            Even in the absence of such explicit authorization,\n\ncommon sense would dictate such a result.         If an appeal were to\n\ndivest the district court of authority to supervise the conditions\n\n\n                                    -3-\n\fof the convicted defendant’s release, then there would be no such\n\nsupervision at all.    This cannot be the intention of Congress.       See\n\nUnited States v. Turkette, 452 U.S. 576, 580 (1981) (“absurd\n\nresults are to be avoided”).\n\n            Although there is apparently no case directly on point,\n\ntwo of our sister circuits have found that the district court\n\nretains jurisdiction under similar circumstances.              See United\n\nStates v. Phelps, 283 F.3d 1176, 1181 n.5 (9th Cir. 2002) (holding\n\nin   case   of   insanity   acquittee    that   district   court   retained\n\njurisdiction to monitor and modify conditions of release under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 4243(f), despite pending appeal, where statute allowed\n\ncourt to modify conditions at any later time); United States v.\n\nMeyers, 95 F.3d 1475, 1489 n.6 (10th Cir. 1996) (district court\n\nretains jurisdiction to rule on motion for bail pending appeal).\n\nBoth we and the Eighth Circuit have made clear that the district\n\ncourt does not lose all jurisdiction upon appeal. United States v.\n\nHurley, 63 F.3d 1, 23-24 (1st Cir. 1995) (pointing out that\n\ndivestiture rule is not absolute and holding that district court\n\nretains jurisdiction to modify restitution order); United States v.\n\nVanhorn, 296 F.3d 713, 721 (8th Cir. 2002) (district court retains\n\njurisdiction to modify restitution order).\n\n            Accordingly, we conclude that the district court had\n\njurisdiction to modify the conditions of D’Amario’s supervised\n\nrelease.\n\n\n                                   -4-\n\f                                    II.\n\n          On the merits of his appeal, D’Amario claims that the\n\ncondition of community confinement is not a permissible condition\n\nof supervised release.     Specifically, he argues that 18 U.S.C.\n\n§ 3583(d) does not authorize the district court to impose community\n\nconfinement as a condition of supervised release.\n\n          The problem with this claim is that it was not raised\n\nbelow.   Although not in favor of community confinement, D’Amario\n\nnever raised the issue of the district court’s statutory authority\n\nto impose such a condition with that court.\n\n           We are limited, therefore, to a plain error review of\n\nthis claim.   United States v. Duarte, 246 F.3d 56, 60 (1st Cir.\n\n2001).   Under this standard, D’Amario must establish “(1) that an\n\nerror occurred (2) which is clear or obvious and which not only (3)\n\naffected [his] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired\n\nthe   fairness,   integrity,   or    public   reputation   of   judicial\n\nprocedings.” Id. Under this standard, D’Amario’s claim must fail.\n\n          D’Amario cannot satisfy the first two prongs of the plain\n\nerror test because the error he asserts is neither an error nor\n\nplain.   The crux of D’Amario’s argument is that the statutory\n\nauthority for imposition of community confinement lay in § 3583\n\n(d)’s incorporation by reference of § 3563(b)(12), which then\n\nclearly provided for such a condition.        When, some years later,\n\n§ 3563(b)(12) was renumbered to (b)(11), no corresponding change\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\fwas made to § 3583(d), which, therefore, no longer contained an\n\naccurate reference to the community confinement section.                 Thus,\n\naccording    to    D’Amario,   community   confinement      is   no     longer\n\nauthorized by statute.\n\n            The problem with this argument is that it has been\n\nconsidered and rejected by two of our sister circuits.                Both the\n\nEighth and the Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals have held that\n\ncommunity confinement remains an authorized condition of supervised\n\nrelease under Section 3583(d), despite the omission of an accurate\n\nreference to the current community confinement provision, Section\n\n3563(b)(11).      United States v. Griner, 358 F.3d 979, 982 (8th Cir.\n\n2004); United States v. Bahe, 201 F.3d 1124, 1136 (9th Cir. 2000).\n\nBoth courts have held that the omission of the cross-reference was\n\nthe result of an inadvertent clerical error caused by changes made\n\nto, and the renumbering of, § 3563(b)(11), occurring 12 years after\n\n§ 3583(d) was enacted.         Both have concluded that, despite this\n\nclerical error, a district court retains the authority to impose\n\ncommunity confinement as a condition of supervised release.                Id.\n\nSee also Hassett v. Welch, 303 U.S. 303, 314 (1938) (adoption of\n\none statute by another “takes the statute as it exists at the time\n\nof   adoption     and   does   not   include   subsequent    additions      or\n\nmodifications by the statute so taken unless it does so by express\n\nintent”).   We agree with our sister circuits.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -6-\n\f          Although one district court has held to the contrary,1\n\nUnited States v. Mills, 186 F. Supp. 2d 965, 967-70 (E.D. Wis.\n\n2002), this creates, at best, a split of authority, with the\n\nmajority view being that the district court has the authority to\n\nimpose   community   confinement.     Under   these   circumstances,\n\nD’Amario’s claim of plain error must fail.     See United States v.\n\nWhab, 355 F.3d 155, 158 (2d Cir.) (“an error cannot be deemed\n\n‘plain,’ in the absence of binding precedent, where there is a\n\ngenuine dispute among the circuits”), cert. denied, 124 S. Ct. 2055\n\n(2004); United States v. Díaz, 285 F.3d 92, 97 (1st Cir. 2002)\n\n(where law on issue was unsettled in First Circuit and other\n\ncircuits were split, error could not be deemed “plain”).    See also\n\nUnited States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734 (1993) (“[a]t a minimum,\n\n[a] court of appeals cannot correct an error pursuant to Rule 52(b)\n\nunless the error is clear under current law).    Therefore, we find\n\nno merit in D’Amario’s claim that the district court had no\n\nstatutory authority to impose community confinement as a condition\n\nof his supervised release.\n\n          Finally, D’Amario claims that the modification in the\n\nconditions of his supervised release requiring him to participate\n\nin a community confinement program was not supported by the record.\n\n\n\n1\n    Although D’Amario cites another district court opinion in\nsupport of his argument, United States v. Barrett, 198 F. Supp. 2d\n1046 (S.D. Iowa 2002), that holding has now been overturned by\nGriner.\n\n                                -7-\n\fWe do not agree.    The record amply supports the district court’s\n\nconclusion that D’Amario intended to violate the conditions of his\n\nrelease by returning to Rhode Island without permission and that\n\nsuch an action constituted a legitimate security concern.\n\n                                III.\n\n            Finding that the district court had jurisdiction to\n\nmodify the conditions of his supervised release, and that the\n\nmodification was permissible under the statute and supported by the\n\nrecord, we conclude that there is no merit in the claims raised in\n\nthis appeal.   Accordingly, the order entered by the district court\n\non November 9, 2004, from which this appeal was taken, is hereby\n\naffirmed.\n\n            Affirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                                -8-\n\f",

Subsequent to the modification and appeal, D'Amario was charged with violating the modified conditions and a revocation proceeding was scheduled for June 8, 2005, the same day on which we heard oral argument on this appeal of the modification. At oral argument, we asked the government to report the outcome of the supervised release revocation hearing. The next day, June 9, 2005, the government filed an \"Emergency Motion for Expedited Decision,\" notifying the court that the district court found that D'Amario had violated the modified conditions, revoked his supervised release, sentenced him to a year in prison, and imposed a new term of supervised release. The district court, however, recognizing that its ruling was contingent upon having the jurisdiction both to modify the terms of release as well as to revoke the release, made its ruling provisional, and ordered the parties to brief the issue so that it might decide it. The government, in its emergency motion, suggests that an expedited resolution of this appeal, including the jurisdictional issue, would best serve both the interests of justice and judicial economy. We agree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p>I.</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Amario argues that the appeal of the 2003 district court judgment revoking his supervised release, in which he challenges the validity of the imposition of special conditions of supervised release, divests the district court of jurisdiction to alter any aspect of his supervised release. He contends that once he filed that notice of appeal, all jurisdiction over the case was transferred to the appellate court and the district court lost the authority to modify in any way the conditions it imposed prior to that appeal. We disagree.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Pursuant to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(2) and Fed.R.Crim.P. Rule 32.1(c), the district court has plenary jurisdiction to supervise a convicted defendant's release, including the jurisdiction to modify the conditions of supervised release, even though an appeal from a revocation of supervised release may be pending. The statute authorizes the district court to make such modifications throughout the entire period of supervised release, irrespective of any appeal. The statute provides that the district court \"may modify, reduce, or enlarge the conditions of supervised release, <i>at any time</i> prior to the expiration or termination of the term of supervised release.\" 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(e)(2) (emphasis added). Thus, Congress has expressly authorized the district court to retain jurisdiction over and supervise the release of convicted defendants, including during the pendency of their appeals.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even in the absence of such explicit authorization, common sense would dictate such a result. If an appeal were to divest the district court of authority to supervise the conditions of the convicted defendant's release, then there would be no such supervision at all. This cannot be the intention of Congress. <i>See United States v.

Phelps,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"776963\"><a href=\"/opinion/776963/united-states-v-coy-ray-phelps/\"><span class=\"volume\">283</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1176</span></a></span>, 1181 n. 5 (9th Cir.2002) (holding in case of insanity acquittee that district court retained jurisdiction to monitor and modify conditions of release under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 4243(f), despite pending appeal, where statute allowed court to modify conditions at any later time); <i>United States v.

Both we and the Eighth Circuit have made clear that the district court does not lose all jurisdiction upon appeal. <i>United States v.

Specifically, he argues that 18 U.S.C. &#167; 3583(d) does not authorize the district court to impose community confinement as a condition of supervised release.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with this claim is that it was not raised below. Although not in favor of community confinement, D'Amario never raised the issue of the district court's statutory authority to impose such a condition with that court.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We are limited, therefore, to a plain error review of this claim. <i>United States v. Duarte,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199375\"><a href=\"/opinion/199375/united-states-v-duarte/\"><span class=\"volume\">246</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">56</span></a></span>, 60 (1st Cir.2001). Under this standard, D'Amario must establish \"(1) that an error occurred (2) which is clear or obvious and which not only (3) affected [his] substantial rights, but also (4) seriously impaired the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" <i>Id.</i> Under this standard, D'Amario's claim must fail.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">D'Amario cannot satisfy the first two prongs of the plain error test because the error he asserts is neither an error nor plain. The crux of D'Amario's argument is that the statutory authority for imposition of community confinement lay in &#167; 3583(d)'s incorporation by reference of &#167; 3563(b)(12), which then clearly provided for such a condition. When, some years later, &#167; 3563(b)(12) was renumbered to (b)(11), no corresponding change was made to &#167; 3583(d), which, therefore, no longer contained an accurate reference to the community confinement section. Thus, according to D'Amario, community confinement is no longer authorized by statute.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The problem with this argument is that it has been considered and rejected by two of our sister circuits. Both the Eighth and the Ninth Circuit Courts of Appeals have held that community confinement remains an authorized condition of supervised release under Section 3583(d), despite the omission of an accurate reference to the current community confinement provision, Section 3563(b)(11). <i>United States v. Griner,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"785149\"><a href=\"/opinion/785149/united-states-v-carlton-earl-griner-united-states-of-america-v-lonnie/\"><span class=\"volume\">358</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">979</span></a></span>, 982 (8th Cir.2004); <i>United States v. Bahe,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"767434\"><a href=\"/opinion/767434/united-states-v-edward-bahe/\"><span class=\"volume\">201</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1124</span></a></span>, 1136 (9th Cir.2000). Both courts have held that the omission of the cross-reference was the result of an inadvertent clerical error caused by changes made to, and the renumbering of, &#167; 3563(b)(11), occurring 12 years after &#167; 3583(d) was enacted. Both have concluded that, despite this clerical error, a district court retains the authority to impose community confinement as a condition of supervised release. <i>Id. See also Hassett v. Welch,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"102978\"><a href=\"/opinion/102978/hassett-v-welch/\"><span class=\"volume\">303</span> <span class=\"reporter\">U.S.</span> <span class=\"page\">303</span></a></span>, 314, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">58</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

We agree with our sister circuits.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although one district court has held to the contrary,<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> <i>United States v.

Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">965</span></a></span>, 967-70 (E.D.Wis.2002), this creates, at best, a split of authority, with the majority view being that the district court has the authority to impose community confinement. Under these circumstances, D'Amario's claim of plain error must fail. <i>See United States v. Whab,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"784767\"><a href=\"/opinion/784767/united-states-v-usama-sadik-ahmed-abdel-whab/\"><span class=\"volume\">355</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></a></span>, 158 (2d Cir.)
