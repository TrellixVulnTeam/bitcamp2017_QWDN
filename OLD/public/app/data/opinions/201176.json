George Z. Singal, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                             Before\n\n                       Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Coffin and Cyr, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Thomas F. Hallett on brief for appellant.\n     Paula D. Silsby, United States Attorney, and F. Mark Terison,\nSenior Litigation Counsel, on brief for appellee.\n\n\n\n                          August 6, 2004\n\f             SELYA, Circuit Judge.           On December 11, 2002, a federal\n\ngrand jury superseded a single-count indictment handed up some four\n\nmonths earlier and charged defendant-appellant Peter McLaughlin,\n\ninter alios, with three counts involving drug trafficking.                  See 21\n\nU.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1), 846; 18 U.S.C. § 2.                On March 10, 2003, while\n\nMcLaughlin was free on pretrial release, local authorities arrested\n\nhim   for    operating    a    motor    vehicle     under    the    influence    of\n\nintoxicating liquor.      See Me. Rev. Stat. Ann. tit. 29, § 2411.              The\n\nnext day, he was again arrested and taken into state custody, this\n\ntime for possession of heroin.              See id. tit. 17-A, § 1107-a.\n\n             McLaughlin       reached   an     agreement     with    the   federal\n\nprosecutor on April 4, 2003.            As a result, he pleaded guilty on\n\nthat date to a single-count information that charged him with a\n\none-time violation of 21 U.S.C. § 841(a)(1).                 At the disposition\n\nhearing, the district court, troubled by McLaughlin's misbehavior\n\nwhile on pretrial release, refused to reduce his offense level for\n\nacceptance of responsibility.           See USSG §3E1.1(a) (providing that\n\na defendant's offense level may be reduced by two levels if \"the\n\ndefendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his\n\noffense\").      The   court     then    imposed     a   35-month    incarcerative\n\nsentence    and,   pursuant      to   the    plea   agreement,      dismissed   the\n\nsuperseding indictment vis-à-vis McLaughlin.\n\n            McLaughlin's appeal focuses on a single ruling:                     the\n\ndenial of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.\n\n\n                                        -2-\n\fAn inquiry into whether a defendant has accepted responsibility is\n\ntypically a fact-dominated enterprise, and we ordinarily review the\n\nsentencing court's determination of such an issue for clear error.\n\nUnited States v. Talladino, 38 F.3d 1255, 1263 (1st Cir. 1994);\n\nUnited States v. Royer, 895 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir. 1990).    When the\n\nquestion involves an interpretation of the sentencing guidelines,\n\nhowever, we employ de novo review.     See Talladino, 38 F.3d at 1263\n\n(\"[Q]uestions of law — including interpretive questions concerning\n\nthe meaning and scope of the sentencing guidelines — engender de\n\nnovo review.\").      The issue on appeal has two dimensions. It\n\nrequires us first to determine how section 3E1.1(a) operates (a\n\nmatter that entails plenary review)1 and then to determine the\n\nsupportability of the district court's factfinding (a matter that\n\nentails review only for clear error).\n\n            We begin with the law-dominated dimension of McLaughlin's\n\nargument.   He asseverates that he accepted responsibility on April\n\n4, 2003 (when he tendered his guilty plea to a lesser charge); that\n\nhe was fully compliant with the law between that date and the date\n\n\n\n     1\n      The Supreme Court has stated that in cases in which the legal\nquestion is a \"minor, detailed, interstitial question of sentencing\nlaw,\" due deference must be given to the district court's decision.\nBuford v. United States, 532 U.S. 59, 64 (2001). There, however,\nthe issue sub judice involved determining whether a specific\ndefendant's prior convictions had been consolidated for sentencing.\nId. at 60. The fact-intensive nature of that inquiry dictated the\nuse of a deferential standard of review.        Id. at 66.     That\nsituation is easily distinguished from the interpretive question\npresented in this case.\n\n                                 -3-\n\fof sentencing; and that, accordingly, the lower court should have\n\ngranted him a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility.\n\nIn his view, the court erred in factoring his prior arrests into\n\nthe acceptance-of-responsibility calculus because those arrests\n\noccurred before he accepted responsibility (and, thus, had no\n\nbearing on whether his professions of remorse were authentic).    In\n\nessence, then, he proposes an interpretation of section 3E1.1(a)\n\nthat would forbid a sentencing court, when applying the guideline,\n\nfrom examining exogenous acts undertaken by a defendant before he\n\nmanifests an initial acceptance of responsibility (such as by\n\nentering a guilty plea).2\n\n            This is a bold, but misguided, proposition.   In gauging\n\nwhether a defendant has accepted responsibility, a sentencing court\n\nmay appropriately consider whether he has voluntarily ceased all\n\nparticipation in criminal activity.     See USSG §3E1.1, comment.\n\n(n.1(b)).    It follows that when a defendant commits new offenses\n\nafter having been charged and those offenses reflect adversely on\n\nthe sincerity of the defendant's avowed contrition, the sentencing\n\ncourt may treat the commission of those offenses as an indication\n\nthat the defendant has not accepted responsibility for the original\n\ncrime.   United States v. Carrington, 96 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir. 1996).\n\nIn such circumstances, a sentencing court lawfully may \"decline to\n\n\n\n     2\n      By \"exogenous,\" we mean conduct not directly related to the\noffense(s) charged in the pending federal case.\n\n                                 -4-\n\faward a reduction for acceptance of responsibility on that ground\n\nalone.\"   Id.\n\n            McLaughlin seeks to carve out an exception to this\n\nprinciple    for   exogenous    pre-plea   offenses.     Rather   than\n\nacknowledging the radical nature of this exception, he strives to\n\nportray it as a mainstream interpretation supported by a majority\n\nof the courts of appeals.         This portrayal does not withstand\n\nscrutiny.\n\n            To be sure, McLaughlin marshals a long list of cases to\n\nbuttress his proposition.      See, e.g., United States v. Prince, 204\n\nF.3d 1021 (10th Cir. 2000); United States v. Ngo, 132 F.3d 1231\n\n(8th Cir. 1997); United States v. Byrd, 76 F.3d 194 (8th Cir.\n\n1996); United States v. McDonald, 22 F.3d 139 (7th Cir. 1994);\n\nUnited States v. Pace, 17 F.3d 341 (11th Cir. 1994); United States\n\nv. Woods, 927 F.2d 735 (2d Cir. 1991); United States v. Cooper, 912\n\nF.2d 344 (9th Cir. 1990); United States v. Scroggins, 880 F.2d 1204\n\n(11th Cir. 1989).      Fairly read, these decisions do not help\n\nMcLaughlin; they merely stand for the inverse of his proposition.\n\nIn each of them, the defendant had accepted responsibility and then\n\ncommitted a subsequent offense that the district court found\n\nsufficient to undermine the sincerity of the professed acceptance\n\nof responsibility.    See, e.g., Prince, 204 F.3d at 1023-24; Ngo,\n\n132 F.3d at 1233; Byrd, 76 F.3d at 196-97; McDonald, 22 F.3d at\n\n144; Pace, 17 F.3d at 343; Woods, 927 F.2d at 736; Cooper, 912 F.2d\n\n\n                                   -5-\n\fat 348; Scroggins, 880 F.2d at 1215-16.       That reasoning tells us\n\nnothing about whether (or to what extent) acts committed before a\n\ndefendant accepts responsibility should be taken into consideration\n\nin constructing the acceptance-of-responsibility calculus.3\n\n           McLaughlin   places   especially   heavy    reliance   on   the\n\ndecision in United States v. Tilford, 224 F.3d 865 (6th Cir. 2000),\n\nin which the Sixth Circuit, on de novo review, vacated a district\n\ncourt's refusal to award an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction\n\nbased upon the defendant's post-indictment but pre-plea behavior.\n\nA close reading of this decision reveals that the court of appeals\n\ndid not purpose to establish a per se rule anent the timing of an\n\noffender's exogenous acts, but, rather, required that \"there be\n\nsome conduct that the court can find is inconsistent with that\n\nspecific acceptance of responsibility [betokened by] the guilty\n\nplea.\"   Id. at 868 (quoting United States v. Jeter, 191 F.3d 637,\n\n641 (6th Cir. 1999)) (emphasis in Tilford).       After applying this\n\nrequirement to Tilford's situation, the Sixth Circuit determined\n\nthat the relevant time period in that case was the period between\n\nthe guilty plea and the disposition hearing.          Id.   To the extent\n\n(if at all) that Tilford establishes a per se temporal rule that\n\n\n     3\n      Indeed, in one of the cases cited by McLaughlin, the Eleventh\nCircuit, although not specifically holding that the sentencing\njudge may look to the defendant's behavior before his acceptance of\nresponsibility, upheld a denial of a section 3E1.1(a) credit when\nthe defendant had engaged in illegal behavior while on pretrial\nrelease before entering a guilty plea. See Scroggins, 880 F.2d at\n1216.\n\n                                  -6-\n\fdebars a sentencing court from examining any pre-plea behavior in\n\nthe course of gauging the genuineness of an accused's acceptance of\n\nresponsibility, we deem it inconsistent with Carrington, 96 F.3d at\n\n9, and decline to follow it.4\n\n                Having       found        McLaughlin's       string      of        citations\n\nunpersuasive, we take a fresh look at the issue that he raises.                            A\n\ndefendant        is   entitled       to    a   two-level     credit   if      he    \"clearly\n\ndemonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\"                             USSG\n\n§3E1.1(a).        The burden is on the defendant to show an entitlement\n\nto the reduction. See United States v. Franky-Ortiz, 230 F.3d 405,\n\n408 (1st Cir. 2000); Royer, 895 F.2d at 29-30.                    Although the entry\n\nof   a       guilty   plea    prior       to   trial   is    impressive       evidence   of\n\nacceptance of responsibility, it does not automatically entitle a\n\ndefendant to the credit.                  See United States v. Bradley, 917 F.2d\n\n601, 606 (1st Cir. 1990); see also USSG §3E1.1, comment. (n.3).\n\nThe sentencing court must still find that the defendant exhibits\n\n\"candor and authentic remorse\" as opposed to mouthing \"a pat\n\nrecital of the vocabulary of contrition.\"                     Royer, 895 F.2d at 30.\n\n                The   Sentencing      Commission       has    provided     guidance      for\n\ncourts charged with determining whether heartfelt remorse exists.\n\nSee USSG §3E1.1, comment. (n.1) (limning a non-exclusive list of\n\n\n\n         4\n      The Sixth Circuit seems to be divided on the correct\ninterpretation of Tilford. See United States v. Hakley, ___ Fed.\nAppx. __ (6th Cir. 2004); id. at __ (Suhrheinrich, J., dissenting).\n\n\n                                               -7-\n\ffactors that courts may consider in that regard).              One factor is\n\nwhether the defendant \"voluntarily has terminated or withdrawn from\n\ncriminal conduct or associations.\"           Id. (n.1(b)). There is nothing\n\nin this application note or elsewhere in the guidelines to suggest\n\na temporal limit on this factor.         Moreover, the non-exclusivity of\n\nthe list suggests that the sentencing court should look to all\n\nrelevant data to reach a just result.           For these reasons, we agree\n\nwith the Fifth Circuit that the commentary to section 3E1.1 fairly\n\nimplies that \"a defendant's failure to comply with conditions of a\n\nbond [can] be highly relevant to assessing the sincerity of the\n\ndefendant's contrition.\"        United States v. Hooton, 942 F.2d 878,\n\n883 (5th Cir. 1991).\n\n          On policy grounds, the temporal cut-off proposed by\n\nMcLaughlin   makes   very   little      sense.       Timely   acceptances    of\n\nresponsibility already are rewarded by a provision that allows for\n\nan additional one-level reduction if the defendant \"(1) timely\n\nprovid[es] complete information to the government concerning his\n\nown   involvement    in   the    offense;       or   (2)   timely   notif[ies]\n\nauthorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby\n\npermitting   the    government    to    avoid    preparing    for   trial   and\n\npermitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently.\"                USSG\n\n§3E1.1(b).   It would be perverse to encourage a practice whereby a\n\ndefendant, released on bail, would be benefitted by waiting as long\n\nas possible before accepting responsibility.                Yet that is what\n\n\n                                       -8-\n\fwould happen if McLaughlin's argument were to prevail.                    Deferring\n\na guilty plea would work to a defendant's advantage by shrinking\n\nthe universe of conduct that could be counted against him in the\n\nacceptance-of-responsibility calculus.             In other words, the longer\n\nthe defendant postponed the entering of a guilty plea, the less the\n\nexogenous criminal conduct that the sentencing court would be able\n\nto consider.      And this would be so regardless of the heinousness of\n\nthe exogenous crimes or the lack of contrition that they might\n\nbetoken.     The guidelines ought to be construed in a commonsense\n\nmanner, and we are not inclined to impute to the Sentencing\n\nCommission so counter-intuitive a design.\n\n             We    note,   too,      that     courts    regularly     consider      a\n\ndefendant's       favorable     pre-plea    conduct     in   granting      downward\n\nadjustments for acceptance of responsibility.                 See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Sklar, 920 F.2d 107, 115-16 (1st Cir. 1990); United\n\nStates v. Wilkes, 130 F. Supp. 2d 222, 240 (D. Mass. 2001).                      Most\n\nstreets run two ways, and McLaughlin has offered no sensible reason\n\nwhy a defendant's praiseworthy pre-plea conduct should be figured\n\ninto the calculus but his blameworthy pre-plea conduct should not.\n\n           To     sum    up,    we   conclude    that    McLaughlin's       cramped\n\ninterpretation of the acceptance-of-responsibility guideline is\n\nincorrect.        We   reject   that   interpretation        and   hold   that    the\n\ndistrict court had the right to consider McLaughlin's exogenous\n\n\n\n\n                                        -9-\n\fpre-plea conduct in denying him an acceptance-of-responsibility\n\ndiscount.\n\n            Anticipating      the   possibility       of   such   a   holding,\n\nMcLaughlin    makes   an    alternative        argument.   This   argument   is\n\npremised on two facts:       (1) that he pleaded to an information that\n\ndid not exist until around the time of the plea agreement, and (2)\n\nthat the exogenous crimes he committed while on pretrial release\n\nantedated    the   filing    of   the    information.      Building   on   this\n\nfoundation, he posits that those crimes could not be used to\n\njustify the denial of an acceptance-of-responsibility adjustment.\n\nHis premise is accurate, but the conclusion that he draws from it\n\nis not.\n\n             As a general matter, it is true that courts cannot go\n\nback limitlessly in time in assessing acceptance of responsibility.\n\nSee United States v. Ceccarani, 98 F.3d 126, 130 (3d Cir. 1996);\n\nMcDonald, 22 F.3d at 141.           Normally, the lodging of a federal\n\ncharge marks the commencement of the relevant time frame. Tilford,\n\n224 F.3d 868 (explaining that a \"defendant must be on notice that\n\nthe federal government has an interest in his or her affairs before\n\nthe acceptance-of-responsibility guideline comes into play\").5 The\n\nrationale for using this milestone is that the clock should start\n\n\n\n     5\n      Given the Tilford court's wording of this rule, it is\narguable that knowledge of a federal investigation may be enough to\nstart the clock. For present purposes, we need not explore that\npossibility.\n\n                                        -10-\n\fto run no later than the time that the defendant has been put on\n\nnotice, by the filing of a formal charge, that federal prosecutors\n\nhave taken an interest in his conduct.\n\n            McLaughlin's argument founders on these shoals. From and\n\nafter the date of the original indictment, McLaughlin knew full\n\nwell that the Justice Department had an interest in the conduct\n\nunderlying the count of conviction (i.e., his drug trafficking in\n\nApril of 2002).      He nevertheless committed other crimes while on\n\npretrial release for the federal charge.         Tellingly, the very same\n\nconduct supplied the basis both for the charges contained in the\n\nindictment   and    for   the   lone    count   of   the   information   that\n\nsuperseded it.     Where, as here, the same conduct is the basis of\n\nboth an original and a superseding charge, distinguishing between\n\nthe two for acceptance-of-responsibility purposes would mindlessly\n\nexalt form over substance. Under these circumstances, McLaughlin's\n\nentitlement to an acceptance-of-responsibility discount should not\n\ndepend upon which charging document was in force when he entered\n\nhis plea.\n\n            Our    conclusion    that    the    district    court   properly\n\ninterpreted section 3E1.1(a) as ceding it discretion to consider\n\nMcLaughlin's exogenous pre-plea arrests brings us to the second\n\nhalf of our bifurcated inquiry.         This exercise need not occupy us\n\nfor long.\n\n\n\n\n                                   -11-\n\f          It is uncontroverted that while on pretrial release,\n\nMcLaughlin drove under the influence of alcohol and possessed\n\nheroin.   Pretrial release is far from automatic in federal drug-\n\ntrafficking cases, and by engaging in the conduct described above,\n\nMcLaughlin broke his promise to behave in a law-abiding manner\n\nwhile free on bond.    By like token, those actions impugned the\n\ndistrict court's authority. Thus, it was not clearly erroneous for\n\nthe court to conclude that the commission of these new crimes\n\nbelied the genuineness of any self-serving claim of remorse.   See,\n\ne.g., Ceccarani, 98 F.3d at 129-30 (holding that post-offense\n\nconduct can shed a bright light on the sincerity of a defendant's\n\nprofessed remorse); United States v. Kirkland, 28 F.3d 49, 50-51\n\n(7th Cir. 1994) (similar); United States v. Kidd, 12 F.3d 30, 34\n\n(4th Cir. 1993) (similar).\n\n          To say more on this point would be supererogatory.\n\nKeeping in mind that the defendant must carry the devoir of\n\npersuasion as to whether he deserves a downward adjustment for\n\nacceptance of responsibility, Royer, 895 F.2d at 29-30, we find no\n\nhint of error in the district court's determination that McLaughlin\n\nfell short.   Indeed, this case is a paradigmatic example of the\n\ntenet that a sentencing court properly may deny a reduction for\n\nacceptance of responsibility if a defendant engages in further\n\ncriminal conduct while on pretrial release.     See Carrington, 96\n\nF.3d at 9; see also United States v. O'Neil, 936 F.2d 599, 600 (1st\n\n\n                               -12-\n\fCir. 1991); see generally USSG §3E1.1, comment. (n.1(b)) (noting\n\nthat   appropriate   considerations     in   making   the   acceptance   of\n\nresponsibility   determination   include     a   defendant's   \"voluntary\n\ntermination or withdrawal from criminal conduct\").\n\n            We need go no further.

On March 10, 2003, while McLaughlin was free on pretrial release, local authorities arrested him for operating a motor vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor. <i>See</i> Me.Rev.Stat. Ann. tit. 29, &#167; 2411. The next day, he was again arrested and taken into state custody, this time for possession of heroin. <i>See id.</i> tit. 17-A, &#167; 1107-a.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McLaughlin reached an agreement with the federal prosecutor on April 4, 2003. As a result, he pleaded guilty on that date to a single-count information that charged him with a one-time violation of 21 U.S.C. &#167; 841(a)(1). At the disposition hearing, the district court, troubled by McLaughlin's misbehavior while on pretrial release, refused to reduce his offense level for acceptance of responsibility. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3E1.1(a) (providing that a defendant's offense level may be reduced by two levels if \"the defendant clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense\"). The court then imposed a 35-month incarcerative sentence and, pursuant to the plea agreement, dismissed the superseding indictment vis-a-vis McLaughlin.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McLaughlin's appeal focuses on a single ruling: the denial of a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. An inquiry into whether a defendant has accepted responsibility is typically a fact-dominated enterprise, and we ordinarily review the sentencing court's determination of such an issue for clear error. <i>United States v. Talladino,</i> 38 F.3d 1255, 1263 (1st Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Royer,</i> 895 F.2d 28, 29 (1st Cir.1990). When the question involves an interpretation of the sentencing guidelines, however, we employ de novo review. <i>See Talladino,</i> 38 F.3d at 1263 (\"[Q]uestions of law &#8212; including interpretive questions concerning the meaning and scope of the sentencing guidelines &#8212; engender de novo review.\"). The issue on appeal has two dimensions. It requires us first to determine how section 3E1.1(a) operates (a matter that entails plenary review)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and then to determine the supportability of the district court's factfinding (a matter that entails review only for clear error).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the law-dominated dimension of McLaughlin's argument. He asseverates that he accepted responsibility on April 4, 2003 (when he tendered his guilty plea to a lesser charge); that he was fully compliant with the law between that date and the date of sentencing; and that, accordingly, the lower court should have granted him a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. In his view, the court erred in factoring his prior arrests into the acceptance-of-responsibility calculus because those arrests occurred <i>before</i> he accepted responsibility (and, thus, had no bearing on whether his professions of remorse were authentic). In essence, then, he proposes an interpretation of section 3E1.1(a) that would forbid a sentencing court, when applying the guideline, from examining exogenous acts undertaken by a defendant before he manifests an initial acceptance of responsibility (such as by entering a guilty plea).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a bold, but misguided, proposition. In gauging whether a defendant has accepted responsibility, a sentencing court may appropriately consider whether he has voluntarily ceased all participation in criminal activity. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3E1.1, comment. (n.1(b)). It follows that when a defendant commits new offenses after having been charged and those offenses reflect adversely on the sincerity of the defendant's avowed contrition, the sentencing court may treat the commission of those offenses as an indication that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for the original crime. <i>United States v. Carrington,</i> 96 F.3d 1, 9 (1st Cir.1996). In such circumstances, a sentencing court lawfully may \"decline to award a reduction for acceptance of responsibility on that ground alone.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McLaughlin seeks to carve out an exception to this principle for exogenous pre-plea offenses. Rather than acknowledging the radical nature of this exception, he strives to portray it as a mainstream interpretation supported by a majority of the courts of appeals. This portrayal does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, McLaughlin marshals a long list of cases to buttress his proposition. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Prince,</i> 204 F.3d 1021 (10th Cir.2000); <i>United States v. Ngo,</i> 132 F.3d 1231 (8th Cir.1997); <i>United States v. Byrd,</i> 76 F.3d 194 (8th Cir.1996); <i>United States v. McDonald,</i> 22 F.3d 139 (7th Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Pace,</i> 17 F.3d 341 (11th Cir.1994); <i>United States v. Woods,</i> 927 F.2d 735 (2d Cir.1991); <i>United States v. Cooper,</i> 912 F.2d 344 (9th Cir.1990); <i>United States v. Scroggins,</i> 880 F.2d 1204 (11th Cir.1989). Fairly read, these decisions do not help McLaughlin; they merely stand for the inverse of his proposition. In each of them, the defendant had accepted responsibility and then committed a subsequent offense that the district court found sufficient to undermine the sincerity of the professed acceptance of responsibility. <i>See, e.g., Prince,</i> 204 F.3d at 1023-24; <i>Ngo,</i> 132 F.3d at 1233; <i>Byrd,</i> 76 F.3d at 196-97; <i>McDonald,</i> 22 F.3d at 144; <i>Pace,</i> 17 F.3d at 343; <i>Woods,</i> 927 F.2d at 736; <i>Cooper,</i> 912 F.2d at 348; <i>Scroggins,</i> 880 F.2d at 1215-16. That reasoning tells us nothing about whether (or to what extent) acts committed <i>before</i> a defendant accepts responsibility should be taken into consideration in constructing the acceptance-of-responsibility calculus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McLaughlin places especially heavy reliance on the decision in <i>United States v. Tilford,</i> 224 F.3d 865 (6th Cir.2000), in which the Sixth Circuit, on de novo review, vacated a district court's refusal to award an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction based upon the defendant's post-indictment but pre-plea behavior. A close reading of this decision reveals that the court of appeals did not purpose to establish a per se rule anent the timing of an offender's exogenous acts, but, rather, required that \"there be some conduct that the court can find is inconsistent with that <i>specific</i> acceptance of responsibility [betokened by] the guilty plea.\" <i>Id.</i> at 868 (quoting <i>United States v. Jeter,</i> 191 F.3d 637, 641 (6th Cir.1999)) (emphasis in <i>Tilford</i>). After applying this requirement to Tilford's situation, the Sixth Circuit determined that the relevant time period <i>in that case</i> was the period between the guilty plea and the disposition hearing. <i>Id.</i> To the extent (if at all) that <i>Tilford</i> establishes a per se temporal rule that debars a sentencing court from examining any pre-plea behavior in the course of gauging the genuineness of an accused's acceptance of responsibility, we deem it inconsistent with <i>Carrington,</i> 96 F.3d at 9, and decline to follow it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found McLaughlin's string of citations unpersuasive, we take a fresh look at the issue that he raises. A defendant is entitled to a two-level credit if he \"clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\" USSG &#167; 3E1.1(a). The burden is on the defendant to show an entitlement to the reduction. <i>See United States v. Franky-Ortiz,</i> 230 F.3d 405, 408 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Royer,</i> 895 F.2d at 29-30. Although the entry of a guilty plea prior to trial is impressive evidence of acceptance of responsibility, it does not automatically entitle a defendant to the credit. <i>See United States v. Bradley,</i> 917 F.2d 601, 606 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also</i> USSG &#167; 3E1.1, comment. (n.3). The sentencing court must still find that the defendant exhibits \"candor and authentic remorse\" as opposed to mouthing \"a pat recital of the vocabulary of contrition.\" <i>Royer,</i> 895 F.2d at 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Commission has provided guidance for courts charged with determining whether heartfelt remorse exists. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3E1.1, comment. (n.1) (limning a non-exclusive list of factors that courts may consider in that regard). One factor is whether the defendant \"voluntarily has terminated or withdrawn from criminal conduct or associations.\" <i>Id.</i> (n.1(b)). There is nothing in this application note or elsewhere in the guidelines to suggest a temporal limit on this factor. Moreover, the non-exclusivity of the list suggests that the sentencing court should look to all relevant data to reach a just result. For these reasons, we agree with the Fifth Circuit that the commentary to section 3E1.1 fairly implies that \"a defendant's failure to comply with conditions of a bond [can] be highly relevant to assessing the sincerity of the defendant's contrition.\" <i>United States v. Hooten,</i> 942 F.2d 878, 883 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On policy grounds, the temporal cut-off proposed by McLaughlin makes very little sense. Timely acceptances of responsibility already are rewarded by a provision that allows for an additional one-level reduction if the defendant \"(1) timely provid[es] complete information to the government concerning his own involvement in the offense; or (2) timely notif[ies] authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently.\" USSG &#167; 3E1.1(b). It would be perverse to encourage a practice whereby a defendant, released on bail, would be benefitted by waiting as long as possible before accepting responsibility. Yet that is what would happen if McLaughlin's argument were to prevail. Deferring a guilty plea would work to a defendant's advantage by shrinking the universe of conduct that could be counted against him in the acceptance-of-responsibility calculus. In other words, the longer the defendant postponed the entering of a guilty plea, the less the exogenous criminal conduct that the sentencing court would be able to consider. And this would be so regardless of the heinousness of the exogenous crimes or the lack of contrition that they might betoken. The guidelines ought to be construed in a commonsense manner, and we are not inclined to impute to the Sentencing Commission so counter-intuitive a design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, too, that courts regularly consider a defendant's <i>favorable</i> pre-plea conduct in granting downward adjustments for acceptance of responsibility. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Sklar,</i> 920 F.2d 107, 115-16 (1st Cir.1990); <i>United States v. Wilkes,</i> 130 F.Supp.2d 222, 240 (D.Mass.2001). Most streets run two ways, and McLaughlin has offered no sensible reason why a defendant's praiseworthy pre-plea conduct should be figured into the calculus but his blameworthy pre-plea conduct should not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we conclude that McLaughlin's cramped interpretation of the acceptance-of-responsibility guideline is incorrect. We reject that interpretation and hold that the district court had the right to consider McLaughlin's exogenous pre-plea conduct in denying him an acceptance-of-responsibility discount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anticipating the possibility of such a holding, McLaughlin makes an alternative argument. This argument is premised on two facts: (1) that he pleaded to an information that did not exist until around the time of the plea agreement, and (2) that the exogenous crimes he committed while on pretrial release antedated the filing of the information. Building on this foundation, he posits that those crimes could not be used to justify the denial of an acceptance-of-responsibility adjustment. His premise is accurate, but the conclusion that he draws from it is not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general matter, it is true that courts cannot go back limitlessly in time in assessing acceptance of responsibility. <i>See United States v. Ceccarani,</i> 98 F.3d 126, 130 (3d Cir.1996); <i>McDonald,</i> 22 F.3d at 141. Normally, the lodging of a federal charge marks the commencement of the relevant time frame. <i>Tilford,</i> 224 F.3d at 868 (explaining that a \"defendant must be on notice that the federal government has an interest in his or her affairs before the acceptance-of-responsibility guideline comes into play\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The rationale for using this milestone is that the clock should start to run no later than the time that the defendant has been put on notice, by the filing of a formal charge, that federal prosecutors have taken an interest in his conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McLaughlin's argument founders on these shoals. From and after the date of the original indictment, McLaughlin knew full well that the Justice Department had an interest in the conduct underlying the count of conviction (i.e., his drug trafficking in April of 2002). He nevertheless committed other crimes while on pretrial release for the federal charge. Tellingly, the very same conduct supplied the basis both for the charges contained in the indictment and for the lone count of the information that superseded it. Where, as here, the same conduct is the basis of both an original and a superseding charge, distinguishing between the two for acceptance-of-responsibility purposes would mindlessly exalt form over substance. Under these circumstances, McLaughlin's entitlement to an acceptance-of-responsibility discount should not depend upon which charging document was in force when he entered his plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that the district court properly interpreted section 3E1.1(a) as ceding it discretion to consider McLaughlin's exogenous pre-plea arrests brings us to the second half of our bifurcated inquiry. This exercise need not occupy us for long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is uncontroverted that while on pretrial release, McLaughlin drove under the influence of alcohol and possessed heroin. Pretrial release is far from automatic in federal drug-trafficking cases, and by engaging in the conduct described above, McLaughlin broke his promise to behave in a law-abiding manner while free on bond. By like token, those actions impugned the district court's authority. Thus, it was not clearly erroneous for the court to conclude that the commission of these new crimes belied the genuineness of any self-serving claim of remorse. <i>See, e.g., Ceccarani,</i> 98 F.3d at 129-30 (holding that post-offense conduct can shed a bright light on the sincerity of a defendant's professed remorse); <i>United States v. Kirkland,</i> 28 F.3d 49, 50-51 (7th Cir.1994) (similar); <i>United States v. Kidd,</i> 12 F.3d 30, 34 (4th Cir.1993) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be supererogatory. Keeping in mind that the defendant must carry the devoir of persuasion as to whether he deserves a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <i>Royer,</i> 895 F.2d at 29-30, we find no hint of error in the district court's determination that McLaughlin fell short. Indeed, this case is a paradigmatic example of the tenet that a sentencing court properly may deny a reduction for acceptance of responsibility if a defendant engages in further criminal conduct while on pretrial release. <i>See Carrington,</i> 96 F.3d at 9; <i>see also United States v. O'Neil,</i> 936 F.2d 599, 600 (1st Cir.1991); <i>see generally</i> USSG &#167; 3E1.1, comment. (n.1(b)) (noting that appropriate considerations in making the acceptance of responsibility determination include a defendant's \"voluntary termination or withdrawal from criminal conduct\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. After carefully reviewing the sentencing guidelines, the commentary, the parties' briefs, and the most analogous precedents, we conclude that a sentencing court has the discretion, in an appropriate case, to consider a defendant's conduct at any point after an indictment is handed up or an information is filed. Here, the sentencing court appropriately mulled, and sensibly acted upon, that type of evidence. The record bears out the court's determination that McLaughlin engaged in continued criminal conduct bespeaking a lack of sincere contrition. Consequently, we uphold the court's refusal to reduce McLaughlin's sentence for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Supreme Court has stated that in cases in which the legal question is a \"minor, detailed, interstitial question of sentencing law,\" due deference must be given to the district court's decision<i>Buford v.

There, however, the issue sub judice involved determining whether a specific defendant's prior convictions had been consolidated for sentencing. <i>Id.</i> at 60, 121 S.Ct. 1276.

When the question involves an interpretation of the sentencing guidelines, however, we employ de novo review. <i>See Talladino,</i> 38 F.3d at 1263 (\"[Q]uestions of law &#8212; including interpretive questions concerning the meaning and scope of the sentencing guidelines &#8212; engender de novo review.\"). The issue on appeal has two dimensions. It requires us first to determine how section 3E1.1(a) operates (a matter that entails plenary review)<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> and then to determine the supportability of the district court's factfinding (a matter that entails review only for clear error).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We begin with the law-dominated dimension of McLaughlin's argument. He asseverates that he accepted responsibility on April 4, 2003 (when he tendered his guilty plea to a lesser charge); that he was fully compliant with the law between that date and the date of sentencing; and that, accordingly, the lower court should have granted him a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility. In his view, the court erred in factoring his prior arrests into the acceptance-of-responsibility calculus because those arrests occurred <i>before</i> he accepted responsibility (and, thus, had no bearing on whether his professions of remorse were authentic). In essence, then, he proposes an interpretation of section 3E1.1(a) that would forbid a sentencing court, when applying the guideline, from examining exogenous acts undertaken by a defendant before he manifests an initial acceptance of responsibility (such as by entering a guilty plea).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">This is a bold, but misguided, proposition. In gauging whether a defendant has accepted responsibility, a sentencing court may appropriately consider whether he has voluntarily ceased all participation in criminal activity. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3E1.1, comment. (n.1(b)). It follows that when a defendant commits new offenses after having been charged and those offenses reflect adversely on the sincerity of the defendant's avowed contrition, the sentencing court may treat the commission of those offenses as an indication that the defendant has not accepted responsibility for the original crime. <i>United States v. Carrington,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"196983\"><a href=\"/opinion/196983/united-states-v-carrington/\"><span class=\"volume\">96</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">1</span></a></span>, 9 (1st Cir.1996). In such circumstances, a sentencing court lawfully may \"decline to award a reduction for acceptance of responsibility on that ground alone.\" <i>Id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McLaughlin seeks to carve out an exception to this principle for exogenous pre-plea offenses. Rather than acknowledging the radical nature of this exception, he strives to portray it as a mainstream interpretation supported by a majority of the courts of appeals. This portrayal does not withstand scrutiny.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, McLaughlin marshals a long list of cases to buttress his proposition. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

Fairly read, these decisions do not help McLaughlin; they merely stand for the inverse of his proposition. In each of them, the defendant had accepted responsibility and then committed a subsequent offense that the district court found sufficient to undermine the sincerity of the professed acceptance of responsibility. <i>See, e.g., Prince,</i> 204 F.3d at 1023-24; <i>Ngo,</i> 132 F.3d at 1233; <i>Byrd,</i> 76 F.3d at 196-97; <i>McDonald,</i> 22 F.3d at 144; <i>Pace,</i> 17 F.3d at 343; <i>Woods,</i> 927 F.2d at 736; <i>Cooper,</i> 912 F.2d at 348; <i>Scroggins,</i> 880 F.2d at 1215-16. That reasoning tells us nothing about whether (or to what extent) acts committed <i>before</i> a defendant accepts responsibility should be taken into consideration in constructing the acceptance-of-responsibility calculus.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McLaughlin places especially heavy reliance on the decision in <i>United States v. Tilford,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"770182\"><a href=\"/opinion/770182/united-states-v-larry-eugene-tilforddefendant-appellant/\"><span class=\"volume\">224</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">865</span></a></span> (6th Cir.2000), in which the Sixth Circuit, on de novo review, vacated a district court's refusal to award an acceptance-of-responsibility reduction based upon the defendant's post-indictment but pre-plea behavior. A close reading of this decision reveals that the court of appeals did not purpose to establish a per se rule anent the timing of an offender's exogenous acts, but, rather, required that \"there be some conduct that the court can find is inconsistent with that <i>specific</i> acceptance of responsibility [betokened by] the guilty plea.\" <i>Id.</i> at 868 (quoting <i>United States v. Jeter,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"766142\"><a href=\"/opinion/766142/united-states-v-eddie-d-jeter/\"><span class=\"volume\">191</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">637</span></a></span>, 641 (6th Cir.1999)) (emphasis in <i>Tilford</i>). After applying this requirement to Tilford's situation, the Sixth Circuit determined that the relevant time period <i>in that case</i> was the period between the guilty plea and the disposition hearing. <i>Id.</i> To the extent (if at all) that <i>Tilford</i> establishes a per se temporal rule that debars a sentencing court from examining any pre-plea behavior in the course of gauging the genuineness of an accused's acceptance of responsibility, we deem it inconsistent with <i>Carrington,</i> 96 F.3d at 9, and decline to follow it.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Having found McLaughlin's string of citations unpersuasive, we take a fresh look at the issue that he raises. A defendant is entitled to a two-level credit if he \"clearly demonstrates acceptance of responsibility for his offense.\" USSG &#167; 3E1.1(a). The burden is on the defendant to show an entitlement to the reduction. <i>See United States v. Franky-Ortiz,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"199134\"><a href=\"/opinion/199134/united-states-v-franky-ortiz/\"><span class=\"volume\">230</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span>, 408 (1st Cir.2000); <i>Royer,</i> 895 F.2d at 29-30. Although the entry of a guilty plea prior to trial is impressive evidence of acceptance of responsibility, it does not automatically entitle a defendant to the credit. <i>See United States v. Bradley,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"550637\"><a href=\"/opinion/550637/united-states-v-robert-e-bradley/\"><span class=\"volume\">917</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">601</span></a></span>, 606 (1st Cir.1990); <i>see also</i> USSG &#167; 3E1.1, comment. (n.3). The sentencing court must still find that the defendant exhibits \"candor and authentic remorse\" as opposed to mouthing \"a pat recital of the vocabulary of contrition.\" <i>Royer,</i> 895 F.2d at 30.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The Sentencing Commission has provided guidance for courts charged with determining whether heartfelt remorse exists. <i>See</i> USSG &#167; 3E1.1, comment. (n.1) (limning a non-exclusive list of factors that courts may consider in that regard). One factor is whether the defendant \"voluntarily has terminated or withdrawn from criminal conduct or associations.\" <i>Id.</i> (n.1(b)). There is nothing in this application note or elsewhere in the guidelines to suggest a temporal limit on this factor. Moreover, the non-exclusivity of the list suggests that the sentencing court should look to all relevant data to reach a just result. For these reasons, we agree with the Fifth Circuit that the commentary to section 3E1.1 fairly implies that \"a defendant's failure to comply with conditions of a bond [can] be highly relevant to assessing the sincerity of the defendant's contrition.\" <i>United States v. Hooten,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"567194\"><a href=\"/opinion/567194/united-states-v-david-hooten/\"><span class=\"volume\">942</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">878</span></a></span>, 883 (5th Cir.1991).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On policy grounds, the temporal cut-off proposed by McLaughlin makes very little sense. Timely acceptances of responsibility already are rewarded by a provision that allows for an additional one-level reduction if the defendant \"(1) timely provid[es] complete information to the government concerning his own involvement in the offense; or (2) timely notif[ies] authorities of his intention to enter a plea of guilty, thereby permitting the government to avoid preparing for trial and permitting the court to allocate its resources efficiently.\" USSG &#167; 3E1.1(b). It would be perverse to encourage a practice whereby a defendant, released on bail, would be benefitted by waiting as long as possible before accepting responsibility. Yet that is what would happen if McLaughlin's argument were to prevail. Deferring a guilty plea would work to a defendant's advantage by shrinking the universe of conduct that could be counted against him in the acceptance-of-responsibility calculus. In other words, the longer the defendant postponed the entering of a guilty plea, the less the exogenous criminal conduct that the sentencing court would be able to consider. And this would be so regardless of the heinousness of the exogenous crimes or the lack of contrition that they might betoken. The guidelines ought to be construed in a commonsense manner, and we are not inclined to impute to the Sentencing Commission so counter-intuitive a design.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We note, too, that courts regularly consider a defendant's <i>favorable</i> pre-plea conduct in granting downward adjustments for acceptance of responsibility. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Sklar,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"552336\"><a href=\"/opinion/552336/united-states-v-david-sklar-united-states-of-america-v-david-sklar/\"><span class=\"volume\">920</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">107</span></a></span>, 115-16 (1st Cir.1990); <i>United States v. Wilkes,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"2418658\"><a href=\"/opinion/2418658/united-states-v-wilkes/\"><span class=\"volume\">130</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F. Supp. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">222</span></a></span>, 240 (D.Mass.2001). Most streets run two ways, and McLaughlin has offered no sensible reason why a defendant's praiseworthy pre-plea conduct should be figured into the calculus but his blameworthy pre-plea conduct should not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To sum up, we conclude that McLaughlin's cramped interpretation of the acceptance-of-responsibility guideline is incorrect. We reject that interpretation and hold that the district court had the right to consider McLaughlin's exogenous pre-plea conduct in denying him an acceptance-of-responsibility discount.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Anticipating the possibility of such a holding, McLaughlin makes an alternative argument. This argument is premised on two facts: (1) that he pleaded to an information that did not exist until around the time of the plea agreement, and (2) that the exogenous crimes he committed while on pretrial release antedated the filing of the information. Building on this foundation, he posits that those crimes could not be used to justify the denial of an acceptance-of-responsibility adjustment. His premise is accurate, but the conclusion that he draws from it is not.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As a general matter, it is true that courts cannot go back limitlessly in time in assessing acceptance of responsibility. <i>See United States v. Ceccarani,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"728010\"><a href=\"/opinion/728010/united-states-v-angelo-p-ceccarani/\"><span class=\"volume\">98</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">126</span></a></span>, 130 (3d Cir.1996); <i>McDonald,</i> 22 F.3d at 141. Normally, the lodging of a federal charge marks the commencement of the relevant time frame. <i>Tilford,</i> 224 F.3d at 868 (explaining that a \"defendant must be on notice that the federal government has an interest in his or her affairs before the acceptance-of-responsibility guideline comes into play\").<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> The rationale for using this milestone is that the clock should start to run no later than the time that the defendant has been put on notice, by the filing of a formal charge, that federal prosecutors have taken an interest in his conduct.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">McLaughlin's argument founders on these shoals. From and after the date of the original indictment, McLaughlin knew full well that the Justice Department had an interest in the conduct underlying the count of conviction (i.e., his drug trafficking in April of 2002). He nevertheless committed other crimes while on pretrial release for the federal charge. Tellingly, the very same conduct supplied the basis both for the charges contained in the indictment and for the lone count of the information that superseded it. Where, as here, the same conduct is the basis of both an original and a superseding charge, distinguishing between the two for acceptance-of-responsibility purposes would mindlessly exalt form over substance. Under these circumstances, McLaughlin's entitlement to an acceptance-of-responsibility discount should not depend upon which charging document was in force when he entered his plea.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Our conclusion that the district court properly interpreted section 3E1.1(a) as ceding it discretion to consider McLaughlin's exogenous pre-plea arrests brings us to the second half of our bifurcated inquiry. This exercise need not occupy us for long.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is uncontroverted that while on pretrial release, McLaughlin drove under the influence of alcohol and possessed heroin. Pretrial release is far from automatic in federal drug-trafficking cases, and by engaging in the conduct described above, McLaughlin broke his promise to behave in a law-abiding manner while free on bond. By like token, those actions impugned the district court's authority. Thus, it was not clearly erroneous for the court to conclude that the commission of these new crimes belied the genuineness of any self-serving claim of remorse. <i>See, e.g., Ceccarani,</i> 98 F.3d at 129-30 (holding that post-offense conduct can shed a bright light on the sincerity of a defendant's professed remorse); <i>United States v. Kirkland,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"672949\"><a href=\"/opinion/672949/united-states-v-jeffrey-kirkland/\"><span class=\"volume\">28</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">49</span></a></span>, 50-51 (7th Cir.1994) (similar); <i>United States v. Kidd,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"658833\"><a href=\"/opinion/658833/united-states-v-norman-kidd/\"><span class=\"volume\">12</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 34 (4th Cir.1993) (similar).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To say more on this point would be supererogatory. Keeping in mind that the defendant must carry the devoir of persuasion as to whether he deserves a downward adjustment for acceptance of responsibility, <i>Royer,</i> 895 F.2d at 29-30, we find no hint of error in the district court's determination that McLaughlin fell short. Indeed, this case is a paradigmatic example of the tenet that a sentencing court properly may deny a reduction for acceptance of responsibility if a defendant engages in further criminal conduct while on pretrial release. <i>See Carrington,</i> 96 F.3d at 9; <i>see also United States v. O'Neil,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"563643\"><a href=\"/opinion/563643/united-states-v-shaun-k-oneil/\"><span class=\"volume\">936</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">599</span></a></span>, 600 (1st Cir.1991); <i>see generally</i> USSG &#167; 3E1.1, comment. (n.1(b)) (noting that appropriate considerations in making the acceptance of responsibility determination include a defendant's \"voluntary termination or withdrawal from criminal conduct\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. After carefully reviewing the sentencing guidelines, the commentary, the parties' briefs, and the most analogous precedents, we conclude that a sentencing court has the discretion, in an appropriate case, to consider a defendant's conduct at any point after an indictment is handed up or an information is filed. Here, the sentencing court appropriately mulled, and sensibly acted upon, that type of evidence. The record bears out the court's determination that McLaughlin engaged in continued criminal conduct bespeaking a lack of sincere contrition. Consequently, we uphold the court's refusal to reduce McLaughlin's sentence for acceptance of responsibility.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The Supreme Court has stated that in cases in which the legal question is a \"minor, detailed, interstitial question of sentencing law,\" due deference must be given to the district court's decision<i>Buford v.
