Violeta     Alibeaj petitions\n\nfor review of a decision by the Board of Immigration Appeals\n\n(\"BIA\") which affirmed an immigration judge’s denial of her asylum\n\napplication.      We deny the petition.\n\n                                        I\n\n                                  BACKGROUND\n\n             In February 2001, Alibeaj, a native and citizen of\n\nAlbania, entered the United States illegally.                During her removal\n\nproceedings, Alibeaj submitted an application for asylum, claiming\n\nthat the Albanian Communist and Socialist Parties had persecuted\n\nher and her family for the last fifty-eight years, as follows:                 In\n\n1943,    the     communist   government      arrested      and   executed      her\n\ngrandfather and an uncle, both leaders of the anti-communist\n\nNational Party. During the 1980s, the government arrested and\n\ntortured her future husband and a brother-in-law. In 1990, Alibeaj\n\nattended a pro-democracy demonstration in the capital city of\n\nTirana, at which anti-riot police struck her in the head.              In 1991,\n\nfollowing the fall of the communist regime in Albania and a\n\ntransfer of governmental power to the Democratic Party, Alibeaj\n\njoined   a     support   group   for   persons   who   had    been   victims   of\n\npolitical persecution by the communist government.\n\n             In 1997, the Socialist Party, which included many former\n\ncommunists, won the national election and regained control of the\n\ngovernment. When Alibeaj went into labor with her first child that\n\n\n                                       -2-\n\fyear, the hospital did not dispatch an ambulance to her home, and\n\nrefused to attend to her medical needs or treat her pain during\n\nsixteen hours of labor.               Consequently, her baby was born with\n\nserious mental defects.           Alibeaj contends that her government-\n\nappointed gynecologist – the daughter of a political opponent of\n\nher husband’s family whose father had raped Alibeaj’s mother-in-law\n\n– was the instigator of this denial of adequate medical treatment.\n\nThereafter, Alibeaj sought medical assistance for her ailing son,\n\nbut   was   refused    treatment       when    she   informed     the    doctors   and\n\nhospitals     that    she   was   a    supporter     of   the    Democratic   Party.\n\nAlibeaj traveled to Italy for two years to obtain medical treatment\n\nfor her son, while her husband remained in Albania.                     Alibeaj’s son\n\nsubsequently died of birth defects while in Italy.\n\n              In 1997, members of SHIK, the Albanian secret police\n\norganization, arrested and tortured Alibeaj’s sister-in-law after\n\nshe wrote a history of Alibeaj’s husband’s family, which was\n\ncritical    of   the   former     communist      regime’s       repressive    tactics\n\nagainst its political opponents.                 When the sister-in-law was\n\nreleased after five days, she was so psychologically shell-shocked\n\nthat she was unable to speak.            Eventually, she emigrated to Italy,\n\nwhere   she    committed     suicide.          The   government     unsuccessfully\n\ncontinued its search for copies of the sister-in-law’s book, at\n\nAlibeaj’s residence and elsewhere.\n\n              In 2000, following two years in Italy, Alibeaj returned\n\n\n                                         -3-\n\fto Albania, whereupon SHIK agents stalked Alibeaj and threatened to\n\nkill her and her family if they did not leave Albania.                  On one\n\noccasion, SHIK agents physically assaulted her husband and stole\n\nall    of    his   construction   tools,    thereby   depriving   him   of   his\n\nlivelihood.         Thereafter, Alibeaj left Albania for the United\n\nStates.\n\n              In September 2004, an immigration judge (\"IJ\") orally\n\nrejected her asylum application, stating as follows:\n\n                   I’m going to deny the application [for\n              asylum] because I’m just not seeing any\n              connection here between any of the five\n              enumerated grounds in what she’s related. And\n              I’m not sure that what she’s related amounts\n              to past persecution to her. And I don’t see\n              that she has a well-founded fear of future\n              persecution on account of any of the five\n              enumerated grounds if she returns to Albania.\n\n              Alibeaj filed a timely appeal of the IJ’s decision to the\n\nBIA.        The BIA adopted and affirmed, thus signifying that its\n\n“conclusions upon review of the record coincide with those which\n\nthe [IJ] articulated in his or her decision.”            The BIA added:\n\n                    We   agree    with  the  [IJ]  that  the\n              respondent failed to establish that she\n              suffered persecution. Despite the regrettable\n              actions that have befallen the respondent and\n              her family, we cannot find that the incidents\n              described rise to the severity to constitute\n              persecution.     We further are unable to find\n              that the respondent has a well-founded fear of\n              persecution if she returns to Albania.      We\n              cannot identify any particular factors that\n              would    cause    us   to  conclude  that  the\n              respondent’s fear of persecution on account of\n              an enumerated ground is well–founded based on\n              current political conditions in Albania. In\n\n                                      -4-\n\f            addition, an asylum applicant does not have a\n            well-founded fear of persecution if the\n            applicant    could   avoid    persecution   by\n            relocating to another part of the applicant’s\n            country of nationality or, if stateless,\n            another part of the applicant’s country of\n            last habitual residence, if under all the\n            circumstances, it would be reasonable to\n            expect the applicant to do so. The respondent\n            has not established that internal relocation\n            is not a viable option. The decision of the\n            [IJ] is also affirmed for the reasons provided\n            herein.\n\nAlibeaj petitions for review of the BIA decision.\n\n                                     II\n\n                                 DISCUSSION\n\n            Alibeaj contends that the IJ’s and BIA’s finding that she\n\ndid not suffer past persecution in Albania was not supported by the\n\nevidence,   which   showed   serious      political   retribution   by   the\n\ncommunists and socialists in the form of executions, torture,\n\nbeatings, death threats, and denials of essential medical care.\n\n            Eligibility for asylum requires that the alien prove her\n\nstatus as a “refugee,” 8 U.S.C. § 1158(b)(1)(A), (b)(1)(B)(i); see\n\nMehilli v. Gonzales, 433 F.3d 86, 90 n.5 (1st Cir. 2005), in that\n\nshe suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future\n\npersecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a\n\nparticular social group, or political opinion if she were to return\n\nto her country of nationality, see id. (citing § 1101(a)(42)(A)).\n\nThe   Alibeaj   asylum   claim    alleges   persecution   on   account   of\n\n“political opinion.”      If the alien cannot meet her burden to\n\n\n                                    -5-\n\festablish past persecution, she will be entitled to asylum only if\n\nshe can establish that she harbors a fear of future persecution\n\nthat is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable.   See\n\nPalma-Mazaiegos v. Gonzales, 428 F.3d 30, 34-35 (1st Cir. 2005).\n\n          Should the alien meet her burden of establishing past\n\npersecution, however, a presumption arises that her fear of future\n\npersecution is well-founded.   See Bollanos v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d\n\n82, 85 (1st Cir. 2006).   In order to rebut that presumption, the\n\ngovernment must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that\n\n(i) the country of origin has experienced a “fundamental change in\n\ncircumstances” since the alien’s departure which obviates her\n\npreviously well-founded fear of persecution, or (ii) the alien\n\nreasonably could avoid future persecution by relocating to another\n\npart of the country.   8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i).   We review the\n\nIJ’s and the BIA’s findings under the “substantial evidence”\n\nstandard, and will reverse only if we conclude that the record\n\nevidence would compel a contrary finding.   See Dhima v. Gonzales,\n\n416 F.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir. 2005); see also Berrio-Barrera v.\n\nGonzales, 460 F.3d 163, 167 (1st Cir. 2006) (noting that whether\n\napplicant has proved that persecution was motivated by one of the\n\nfive statutorily protected grounds is a question of fact).\n\nA.   \"Past Persecution\"\n\n          “[E]stablishing past persecution in a daunting task,” and\n\nAlibeaj “bears a heavy burden.”    Guzman v. INS, 327 F.3d 11, 15\n\n\n                               -6-\n\f(1st   Cir.     2003).       Although     her    experiences         of   political\n\ndiscrimination in Albania certainly are regrettable, Alibeaj cannot\n\nsurmount the deferential standard of review.                  First, for purposes\n\nof establishing the right to asylum, the discriminatory experiences\n\nmust have reached a fairly high threshold of seriousness, as well\n\nas some regularity and frequency.              See Susanto v. Gonzales, 439\n\nF.3d 57, 59-60 (1st Cir. 2006) (noting that “[t]he baseline rule is\n\nthat   past    persecution    requires    ‘more        than   mere   discomfiture,\n\nunpleasantness,      harassment,    or        unfair     treatment’”      (citation\n\nomitted)). The more serious episodes of anti-communist persecution\n\nagainst the Alibeaj family and her husband’s family occurred either\n\nin the remote past (e.g., the 1943 execution of her grandfather and\n\nuncle), or predated the fall of the communist regime in 1992 (e.g.,\n\nthe arrest and torture of her future husband). Similarly, although\n\nthe police beat Alibeaj during a pro-democracy demonstration in\n\n1990, this occurred prior to the fall of the communist regime, and\n\nAlibeaj never testified to any permanent or serious physical\n\ninjuries.      See id. at 60 (noting that asylum applicant failed to\n\nprove “persecution” when “no physical confinement and no serious\n\nphysical injuries resulted”).\n\n              Moreover, the post-1992 incidences were too sporadic or\n\ncausally tenuous to compel the IJ to find politically-motivated\n\npersecution.      Although Alibeaj suspected that her gynecologist\n\nsabotaged her 1997 delivery, she herself noted also that the\n\n\n                                        -7-\n\fhospital staff neglected her need for pain medication because they\n\nwere watching the television reports regarding Princess Diana’s\n\ndeath. See Toloza-Jimenez v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 155, 160 (1st Cir.\n\n2005) (observing that an asylum applicant has the burden to show\n\nthe “causal connection between her experiences and . . . the\n\nstatutory grounds for persecution”).             Similarly, Alibeaj noted\n\nthat the medical personnel at other facilities subsequently refused\n\nto treat her newborn son’s condition, yet she failed to provide any\n\nspecific facts from which the IJ might evaluate whether Alibeaj\n\nmade a reasonably exhaustive search for medical treatment prior to\n\nleaving for Italy.     Absent evidence to the contrary, it would seem\n\nentirely reasonable that some physicians in Albania support the\n\nDemocratic Party.      Thus, if Alibeaj experienced but a couple of\n\npolitically-motivated refusals of medical treatment before she\n\nabandoned her efforts, this limited impediment might not suffice\n\nalone to establish “persecution.”\n\n            Although the 1997 arrest and torture of Alibeaj’s sister-\n\nin-law    arguably   shows   that    the    sister-in-law   was   persecuted,\n\nSocialist Party sympathizers targeted the sister-in-law for a\n\nreason that does not pertain to Alibeaj:          she wrote and threatened\n\nto publish a \"tell-all\" book critical of the former communist\n\nregime.    Alibeaj acknowledges that she has never been a member of\n\nthe Democratic Party, nor taken any concrete political actions\n\ncomparable   to   those   of   her   sister-in-law    which   unduly    might\n\n\n                                      -8-\n\fantagonize Communist or Socialist Party sympathizers.\n\n            The     nature   of   the    death     threats,     beating,      and\n\nmisappropriation of property that Alibeaj and her husband suffered\n\nupon her return from Italy in 2000 is also plainly insufficient to\n\ncompel a finding of persecution.               The allegations are serious\n\nindeed, but police misdeeds even more egregious or sustained have\n\nfailed to clear the persecution hurdle.            See, e.g., Susanto, 439\n\nF.3d   at   59-60   (observing    that   even    physical     abuse   does    not\n\nnecessarily    prove   persecution,      and    collecting    cases);   Zui    v.\n\nGonzales, 412 F.3d 202, 204-05 (1st Cir. 2005) (same, concerning\n\nthreats to life or health).\n\nB.     Changed Circumstances\n\n            Even if we were to conclude that the IJ and BIA erred in\n\nfinding that the experiences described by Alibeaj did not rise to\n\nthe level of past “persecution,” and that Alibeaj therefore met her\n\nburden to establish past persecution, the government had the\n\nopportunity to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of\n\nfuture persecution by proving by a preponderance of the evidence\n\nthat the circumstances in Albania had changed so fundamentally\n\nsince Alibeaj left in 2001 as to obviate her otherwise well-founded\n\nfear of future persecution.             See 8 C.F.R. § 208.13(b)(1)(i).\n\nIndeed, the BIA specifically held that the government had met its\n\nburden, stating that it could not “identify any particular factors\n\nthat would cause us to conclude that the respondent’s fear of\n\n\n                                    -9-\n\fpersecution on account of an enumerated ground is well–founded\n\nbased   on    current   political   conditions     in    Albania.”       (Emphasis\n\nadded.)      The record amply supports this factual finding.\n\n              The   agency   adduced    the   2003      United   States     State\n\nDepartment Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Albania\n\n(dated 2/25/04), which discloses that the climate for political\n\noppositionists in Albania has fundamentally improved since 2001.\n\nSee Tota v. Gonzales, 457 F.3d 161, 166 (1st Cir. 2006) (“[W]here\n\na [State Department] report demonstrates fundamental changes in the\n\nspecific circumstances that form the basis of a petitioner's\n\npresumptive fear of future persecution, it ‘may be sufficient, in\n\nand of itself,’ to rebut that presumption.”); Palma-Mazariegos, 428\n\nF.3d at 36 (noting that State Department reports are “generally\n\nprobative of country conditions”).            For example, Albania held\n\nmulti-party     parliamentary    elections    in     2003   under    a    reformed\n\nelectoral code with almost no reported incidences of the type of\n\npolitically-motivated violence that had plagued its earlier post-\n\ncommunist elections. The Socialist Party failed to win a majority,\n\nand was forced to form a coalition government with two other minor\n\nparties, with the Democratic Party as the second largest vote-\n\ngetter sitting in opposition.          In 2003, there were no reports of\n\npolitically-motivated killings, disappearances, or detainees held\n\nstrictly for political reasons, and Albania ratified the Convention\n\nAgainst Torture.\n\n\n                                       -10-\n\f             Alibeaj cites only one report that police used excessive\n\nforce:   at a May 2003 rally in Tirana of former political prisoners\n\nseeking government compensation for their enforced hard labor under\n\nthe former communist regime.            However, this isolated reference\n\nwould not compel the IJ’s factfinding, given that (i) Alibeaj has\n\nnever    contended    that   she    wished    or   intends   to     petition   the\n\ngovernment for redress, and/or that she is even eligible for such\n\ncompensation; and (ii) the Report simultaneously states that the\n\nAlbanian government condemned this police malfeasance and took\n\nimmediate legislative steps to prevent its recurrence.\n\n             Thus,     the   BIA’s     conclusion     that     the     political\n\ncircumstances in Albania have changed fundamentally in Albania over\n\nthe   past   six     years   is    entirely   consistent     with    its   recent\n\nprecedent.     See Bollanos v. Gonzales, 461 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir.\n\n2006) (noting significance of changed circumstances in Albania and\n\nremedial measures taken by new government in 2003 to reduce police\n\nmisconduct);       Tota, 457 F.3d at 167 (observing that “‘[t]hough\n\nserious political repression existed in the past, there are no\n\nindications of systemic political persecution in Albania at the\n\npresent time’”); cf. Susanto, 439 F.3d at 60-61 (observing that\n\nIndonesian government “has taken serious remedial measures” in\n\nresponse to intense international condemnation of 1998 anti-Chinese\n\nriots); Nikijuluw v. Gonzales, 427 F.3d 115, 122 (1st Cir. 2005)\n\n(citing a State Department Country Report’s observation of a\n\n\n                                       -11-\n\fsignificant decline in violence against Christians in Indonesia).1\n\n          As the agency record does not compel a finding that\n\nAlibeaj would suffer politically-motivated persecution if removed\n\nto Albania, the BIA decision must stand.\n\n          The petition for review is denied.\n\n\n\n\n     1\n      In her petition for review, Alibeaj does not challenge the\nalternative BIA holding that she failed to prove that she could not\nreasonably have located to another part of Albania to avoid future\npersecution, and therefore, we neither review nor comment on that\naspect of its holding.\n\n                               -12-\n\f",

During her removal proceedings, Alibeaj submitted an application for asylum, claiming that the Albanian Communist and Socialist Parties had persecuted her and her family for the last fifty-eight years, as follows: In 1943, the communist government arrested and executed her grandfather and an uncle, both leaders of the anti-communist National Party. During the 1980s, the government arrested and tortured her future husband and a brother-in-law. In 1990, Alibeaj attended a pro-democracy demonstration in the capital city of Tirana, at which anti-riot police struck her in the head. In 1991, following the fall of the communist regime in Albania and a transfer of governmental power to the Democratic Party, Alibeaj joined a support group for persons who had been victims of political persecution by the communist government.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, the Socialist Party, which included many former communists, won the national election and regained control of the government. When Alibeaj went into labor with her first child that year, the hospital did not dispatch an ambulance to her home, and refused to attend to her medical needs or treat her pain during sixteen hours of labor. Consequently, her baby was born with serious mental defects. Alibeaj contends that her government-appointed gynecologist &#8212; the daughter of a political opponent of her husband's family whose father had raped Alibeaj's mother-in-law &#8212; was the instigator of this denial of adequate medical treatment. Thereafter, Alibeaj sought medical assistance for her ailing son, but was refused treatment when she informed the doctors and hospitals that she was a supporter of the Democratic Party. Alibeaj traveled to Italy for two years to obtain medical treatment for her son, while her husband remained in Albania. Alibeaj's son subsequently died of birth defects while in Italy.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 1997, members of SHIK, the Albanian secret police organization, arrested and tortured Alibeaj's sister-in-law after she wrote a history of Alibeaj's husband's family, which was critical of the former communist regime's repressive tactics against its political opponents. When the sister-in-law was released after five days, she was so psychologically shell-shocked that she was unable to speak. Eventually, she emigrated to Italy, where she committed suicide. The government unsuccessfully continued its search for copies of the sister-in-law's book, at Alibeaj's residence and elsewhere.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In 2000, following two years in Italy, Alibeaj returned to Albania, whereupon SHIK agents stalked Alibeaj and threatened to kill her and her family if they did not leave Albania. On one occasion, SHIK agents physically assaulted her husband and stole all of his construction tools, thereby depriving him of his livelihood. Thereafter, Alibeaj left Albania for the United States.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In September 2004, an immigration judge (\"IJ\") orally rejected her asylum application, stating as follows:</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">I'm going to deny the application [for asylum] because I'm just not seeing any connection here between any of the five enumerated grounds in what she's related.

We further are unable to find that the respondent has a well-founded fear of persecution if she returns to Albania. We cannot identify any particular factors that would cause us to conclude that the respondent's fear of persecution on account of an enumerated ground is well-founded based on current political conditions in Albania. In addition, an asylum applicant does not have a well-founded fear of persecution if the applicant could avoid persecution by relocating to another part of the applicant's country of nationality or, if stateless, another part of the applicant's country of last habitual residence, if under all the circumstances, it would be reasonable to expect the applicant to do so. The respondent has not established that internal relocation is not a viable option.

Gonzales,</i> 433 F.3d 86, 90 n. 5 (1st Cir.2005), in that she suffered past persecution or has a well-founded fear of future persecution based on race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion if she were to return to her country of nationality, <i>see id.</i> (citing &#167; 1101(a)(42)(A)). The Alibeaj asylum claim alleges persecution on account of \"political opinion.\" If the alien cannot meet her burden to establish past persecution, she will be entitled to asylum only if she can establish that she harbors a fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <i>See Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales,</i> 428 F.3d 30, 34-35 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Should the alien meet her burden of establishing past persecution, however, a presumption arises that her fear of future persecution is well-founded. <i>See Bollanos v. Gonzales,</i> 461 F.3d 82, 85 (1st Cir.2006). In order to rebut that presumption, the government must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that (i) the country of origin has experienced a \"fundamental change in circumstances\" since the alien's departure which obviates her previously well-founded fear of persecution, <i>or</i> (ii) the alien reasonably could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the country. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(1)(i). We review the IJ's and the BIA's findings under the \"substantial evidence\" standard, and will reverse only if we conclude that the record evidence would compel a contrary finding. <i>See Dhima v. Gonzales,</i> 416 F.3d 92, 95 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also Berrio-Barrera v. Gonzales,</i> 460 F.3d 163, 167 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that whether applicant has proved that persecution was motivated by one of the five statutorily protected grounds is a question of fact).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A. \"<i>Past Persecution</i>\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\"[E]stablishing past persecution in a daunting task,\" and Alibeaj \"bears a heavy burden.\" <i>Guzman v. INS,</i> 327 F.3d 11, 15 (1st Cir.2003). Although her experiences of political discrimination in Albania certainly are regrettable, Alibeaj cannot surmount the deferential standard of review. First, for purposes of establishing the right to asylum, the discriminatory experiences must have reached a fairly high threshold of seriousness, as well as some regularity and frequency. <i>See Susanto v. Gonzales,</i> 439 F.3d 57, 59-60 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that \"[t]he baseline rule is that past persecution requires `more than mere discomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment, or unfair treatment'\" (citation omitted)). The more serious episodes of anti-communist persecution against the Alibeaj family and her husband's family occurred either in the remote past (<i>e.g.,</i> the 1943 execution of her grandfather and uncle), or predated the fall of the communist regime in 1992 (<i>e.g.,</i> the arrest and torture of her future husband). Similarly, although the police beat Alibeaj during a pro-democracy demonstration in 1990, this occurred prior to the fall of the communist regime, and <i>Alibeaj</i> never testified to any permanent or serious physical injuries. <i>See id.</i> at 60 (noting that asylum applicant failed to prove \"persecution\" when \"no physical confinement and no serious physical injuries resulted\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the post-1992 incidences were too sporadic or causally tenuous to compel the IJ to find politically-motivated persecution. Although Alibeaj suspected that her gynecologist sabotaged her 1997 delivery, she herself noted also that the hospital staff neglected her need for pain medication because they were watching the television reports regarding Princess Diana's death. <i>See Toloza-Jimenez v. Gonzales,</i> 457 F.3d 155, 160 (1st Cir.2006) (observing that an asylum applicant has the burden to show the \"causal connection between her experiences and . . . the statutory grounds for persecution\"). Similarly, Alibeaj noted that the medical personnel at other facilities subsequently refused to treat her newborn son's condition, yet she failed to provide any specific facts from which the IJ might evaluate whether Alibeaj made a reasonably exhaustive search for medical treatment prior to leaving for Italy. Absent evidence to the contrary, it would seem entirely reasonable that some physicians in Albania support the Democratic Party. Thus, if Alibeaj experienced but a couple of politically-motivated refusals of medical treatment before she abandoned her efforts, this limited impediment might not suffice alone to establish \"persecution.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the 1997 arrest and torture of Alibeaj's sister-in-law arguably shows that the sister-in-law was persecuted, Socialist Party sympathizers targeted the sister-in-law for a reason that does not pertain to Alibeaj: she wrote and threatened to publish a \"tell-all\" book critical of the former communist regime. Alibeaj acknowledges that she has never been a member of the Democratic Party, nor taken any concrete political actions comparable to those of her sister-in-law which unduly might antagonize Communist or Socialist Party sympathizers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nature of the death threats, beating, and misappropriation of property that Alibeaj and her husband suffered upon her return from Italy in 2000 is also plainly insufficient to compel a finding of persecution. The allegations are serious indeed, but police misdeeds even more egregious or sustained have failed to clear the persecution hurdle. <i>See, e.g., Susanto,</i> 439 F.3d at 59-60 (observing that even physical abuse does not necessarily prove persecution, and collecting cases); <i>Ziu v. Gonzales,</i> 412 F.3d 202, 204-05 (1st Cir.2005) (same, concerning threats to life or health).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Changed Circumstances</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to conclude that the IJ and BIA erred in finding that the experiences described by Alibeaj did not rise to the level of past \"persecution,\" and that Alibeaj therefore met her burden to establish past persecution, the government had the opportunity to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the circumstances in Albania had changed so fundamentally since Alibeaj left in 2001 as to obviate her otherwise well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(1)(i). Indeed, the BIA specifically held that the government had met its burden, stating that it could not \"identify any particular factors that would cause us to conclude that the respondent's fear of persecution on account of an enumerated ground is well-founded based on <i>current political conditions</i> in Albania.\" (Emphasis added.) The record amply supports this factual finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agency adduced the 2003 United States State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Albania (dated 2/25/04), which discloses that the climate for political oppositionists in Albania has fundamentally improved since 2001. <i>See Tota v. Gonzales,</i> 457 F.3d 161, 166 (1st Cir.2006) (\"[W]here a [State Department] report demonstrates fundamental changes in the specific circumstances that form the basis of a petitioner's presumptive fear of future persecution, it `may be sufficient, <i>in and of itself,</i>' to rebut that presumption.\"); <i>Palma-Mazariegos,</i> 428 F.3d at 36 (noting that State Department reports are \"generally probative of country conditions\"). For example, Albania held multi-party parliamentary elections in 2003 under a reformed electoral code with almost no reported incidences of the type of politically-motivated violence that had plagued its earlier post-communist elections. The Socialist Party failed to win a majority, and was forced to form a coalition government with two other minor parties, with the Democratic Party as the second largest vote-getter sitting in opposition. In 2003, there were no reports of politically-motivated killings, disappearances, or detainees held strictly for political reasons, and Albania ratified the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alibeaj cites only one report that police used excessive force: at a May 2003 rally in Tirana of former political prisoners seeking government compensation for their enforced hard labor under the former communist regime. However, this isolated reference would not compel the IJ's factfinding, given that (i) Alibeaj has never contended that she wished or intends to petition the government for redress, and/or that she is even eligible for such compensation; and (ii) the Report simultaneously states that the Albanian government condemned this police malfeasance and took immediate legislative steps to prevent its recurrence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the BIA's conclusion that the political circumstances in Albania have changed fundamentally in Albania over the past six years is entirely consistent with its recent precedent. <i>See Bollanos v. Gonzales,</i> 461 F.3d 82, 86 (1st Cir.2006) (noting significance of changed circumstances in Albania and remedial measures taken by new government in 2003 to reduce police misconduct); <i>Tota,</i> 457 F.3d at 167 (observing that \"`[t]hough serious political repression existed in the past, there are no indications of systemic political persecution in Albania at the present time'\"); <i>cf. Susanto,</i> 439 F.3d at 60-61 (observing that Indonesian government \"has taken serious remedial measures\" in response to intense international condemnation of 1998 anti-Chinese riots); <i>Nikijuluw v. Gonzales,</i> 427 F.3d 115, 122 (1st Cir.2005) (citing a State Department Country Report's observation of a significant decline in violence against Christians in Indonesia).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">As the agency record does not compel a finding that Alibeaj would suffer politically-motivated persecution if removed to Albania, the BIA decision must stand.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>The petition for review is denied.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn-s\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn-s_ref\">*</a>\n        <p> Of the District of Maine, sitting by designation</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> In her petition for review, Alibeaj does not challenge the alternative BIA holding that she failed to prove that she could not reasonably have located to another part of Albania to avoid future persecution, and therefore, we neither review nor comment on that aspect of its holding</p>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n    ",

The Alibeaj asylum claim alleges persecution on account of \"political opinion.\" If the alien cannot meet her burden to establish past persecution, she will be entitled to asylum only if she can establish that she harbors a fear of future persecution that is both subjectively genuine and objectively reasonable. <i>See Palma-Mazariegos v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201897\"><a href=\"/opinion/201897/palma-mazariegos-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">428</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">30</span></a></span>, 34-35 (1st Cir.2005).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Should the alien meet her burden of establishing past persecution, however, a presumption arises that her fear of future persecution is well-founded. <i>See Bollanos v.

In order to rebut that presumption, the government must demonstrate by a preponderance of the evidence that (i) the country of origin has experienced a \"fundamental change in circumstances\" since the alien's departure which obviates her previously well-founded fear of persecution, <i>or</i> (ii) the alien reasonably could avoid future persecution by relocating to another part of the country. 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(1)(i). We review the IJ's and the BIA's findings under the \"substantial evidence\" standard, and will reverse only if we conclude that the record evidence would compel a contrary finding. <i>See Dhima v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201733\"><a href=\"/opinion/201733/dhima-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">416</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">92</span></a></span>, 95 (1st Cir.2005); <i>see also Berrio-Barrera v.

Although her experiences of political discrimination in Albania certainly are regrettable, Alibeaj cannot surmount the deferential standard of review. First, for purposes of establishing the right to asylum, the discriminatory experiences must have reached a fairly high threshold of seriousness, as well as some regularity and frequency. <i>See Susanto v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"202090\"><a href=\"/opinion/202090/susanto-v-gonzales/\"><span class=\"volume\">439</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">57</span></a></span>, 59-60 (1st Cir.2006) (noting that \"[t]he baseline rule is that past persecution requires `more than mere discomfiture, unpleasantness, harassment, or unfair treatment'\" (citation omitted)). The more serious episodes of anti-communist persecution against the Alibeaj family and her husband's family occurred either in the remote past (<i>e.g.,</i> the 1943 execution of her grandfather and uncle), or predated the fall of the communist regime in 1992 (<i>e.g.,</i> the arrest and torture of her future husband). Similarly, although the police beat Alibeaj during a pro-democracy demonstration in 1990, this occurred prior to the fall of the communist regime, and <i>Alibeaj</i> never testified to any permanent or serious physical injuries. <i>See id.</i> at 60 (noting that asylum applicant failed to prove \"persecution\" when \"no physical confinement and no serious physical injuries resulted\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Moreover, the post-1992 incidences were too sporadic or causally tenuous to compel the IJ to find politically-motivated persecution. Although Alibeaj suspected that her gynecologist sabotaged her 1997 delivery, she herself noted also that the hospital staff neglected her need for pain medication because they were watching the television reports regarding Princess Diana's death. <i>See Toloza-Jimenez v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">155</span></span>, 160 (1st Cir.2006) (observing that an asylum applicant has the burden to show the \"causal connection between her experiences and . . . the statutory grounds for persecution\"). Similarly, Alibeaj noted that the medical personnel at other facilities subsequently refused to treat her newborn son's condition, yet she failed to provide any specific facts from which the IJ might evaluate whether Alibeaj made a reasonably exhaustive search for medical treatment prior to leaving for Italy. Absent evidence to the contrary, it would seem entirely reasonable that some physicians in Albania support the Democratic Party. Thus, if Alibeaj experienced but a couple of politically-motivated refusals of medical treatment before she abandoned her efforts, this limited impediment might not suffice alone to establish \"persecution.\"</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Although the 1997 arrest and torture of Alibeaj's sister-in-law arguably shows that the sister-in-law was persecuted, Socialist Party sympathizers targeted the sister-in-law for a reason that does not pertain to Alibeaj: she wrote and threatened to publish a \"tell-all\" book critical of the former communist regime. Alibeaj acknowledges that she has never been a member of the Democratic Party, nor taken any concrete political actions comparable to those of her sister-in-law which unduly might antagonize Communist or Socialist Party sympathizers.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The nature of the death threats, beating, and misappropriation of property that Alibeaj and her husband suffered upon her return from Italy in 2000 is also plainly insufficient to compel a finding of persecution. The allegations are serious indeed, but police misdeeds even more egregious or sustained have failed to clear the persecution hurdle. <i>See, e.g., Susanto,</i> 439 F.3d at 59-60 (observing that even physical abuse does not necessarily prove persecution, and collecting cases); <i>Ziu v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"201619\"><a href=\"/opinion/201619/ziu-v-ashcroft/\"><span class=\"volume\">412</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">202</span></a></span>, 204-05 (1st Cir.2005) (same, concerning threats to life or health).</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">B. <i>Changed Circumstances</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Even if we were to conclude that the IJ and BIA erred in finding that the experiences described by Alibeaj did not rise to the level of past \"persecution,\" and that Alibeaj therefore met her burden to establish past persecution, the government had the opportunity to rebut the presumption of a well-founded fear of future persecution by proving by a preponderance of the evidence that the circumstances in Albania had changed so fundamentally since Alibeaj left in 2001 as to obviate her otherwise well-founded fear of future persecution. <i>See</i> 8 C.F.R. &#167; 208.13(b)(1)(i). Indeed, the BIA specifically held that the government had met its burden, stating that it could not \"identify any particular factors that would cause us to conclude that the respondent's fear of persecution on account of an enumerated ground is well-founded based on <i>current political conditions</i> in Albania.\" (Emphasis added.) The record amply supports this factual finding.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The agency adduced the 2003 United States State Department Country Report on Human Rights Practices for Albania (dated 2/25/04), which discloses that the climate for political oppositionists in Albania has fundamentally improved since 2001. <i>See Tota v. Gonzales,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">457</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">161</span></span>, 166 (1st Cir.2006) (\"[W]here a [State Department] report demonstrates fundamental changes in the specific circumstances that form the basis of a petitioner's presumptive fear of future persecution, it `may be sufficient, <i>in and of itself,</i>' to rebut that presumption.\"); <i>Palma-Mazariegos,</i> 428 F.3d at 36 (noting that State Department reports are \"generally probative of country conditions\"). For example, Albania held multi-party parliamentary elections in 2003 under a reformed electoral code with almost no reported incidences of the type of politically-motivated violence that had plagued its earlier post-communist elections. The Socialist Party failed to win a majority, and was forced to form a coalition government with two other minor parties, with the Democratic Party as the second largest vote-getter sitting in opposition. In 2003, there were no reports of politically-motivated killings, disappearances, or detainees held strictly for political reasons, and Albania ratified the Convention Against Torture.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Alibeaj cites only one report that police used excessive force: at a May 2003 rally in Tirana of former political prisoners seeking government compensation for their enforced hard labor under the former communist regime. However, this isolated reference would not compel the IJ's factfinding, given that (i) Alibeaj has never contended that she wished or intends to petition the government for redress, and/or that she is even eligible for such compensation; and (ii) the Report simultaneously states that the Albanian government condemned this police malfeasance and took immediate legislative steps to prevent its recurrence.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Thus, the BIA's conclusion that the political circumstances in Albania have changed fundamentally in Albania over the past six years is entirely consistent with its recent precedent. <i>See Bollanos v.
