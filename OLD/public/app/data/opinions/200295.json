Paul J. Barbadoro, U.S. District Judge]\n\n\n                               Before\n\n                        Selya, Circuit Judge,\n\n              Coffin and Bownes, Senior Circuit Judges.\n\n\n     Bjorn Lange, Assistant Federal Public Defender, for appellant.\n     Mark E. Howard, Assistant United States Attorney, with whom\nThomas P. Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief, for\nappellee.\n\n\n\n                          January 17, 2003\n\f           SELYA, Circuit Judge.        In this case, a jury convicted\n\ndefendant-appellant Ngai Man Lee of, inter alia, possession of\n\nfifteen or more unauthorized credit cards (known in the statutory\n\nargot as \"access devices\").            On appeal, Lee argues that the\n\ndistrict court erred in failing to require jury unanimity as to\n\nwhich fifteen credit cards he possessed.          The question is one of\n\nfirst impression at the federal appellate level.          Upon reflection,\n\nwe conclude that the district court appropriately rejected the\n\nproffered jury instruction.\n\n           The appellant also advances two other assignments of\n\nerror, namely, (1) that the police officers who questioned and\n\narrested him did so in derogation of his constitutional rights, and\n\n(2) that    a   prejudicial   remark    uttered   at   trial   demanded   the\n\ndeclaration of a mistrial (a course of action eschewed by the\n\ndistrict court).      We reject, more easily, these assignments of\n\nerror.   When all is said and done, we affirm the judgment below.\n\nI.   BACKGROUND\n\n           We sketch the factual background and the travel of the\n\ncase.    We reserve a fuller discussion of particular facts for our\n\nanalysis of the appellant's suppression claim.\n\n            On September 5, 2001 an employee of an emporium in Salem,\n\nNew Hampshire reported an attempted credit card fraud.               Police\n\nofficers responded to the shopping plaza where the store was\n\nlocated.    They eventually stopped, questioned, and arrested both\n\n\n                                   -2-\n\fthe appellant and a companion.      A total of twenty-two unauthorized\n\ncredit cards were found in the companion's wallet, the van in which\n\nthe suspects had been riding, and a dumpster adjacent to a nearby\n\nstore.\n\n          In due season, a federal grand jury indicted both men.\n\nThe companion pleaded guilty and his case is not now before us.\n\nThe appellant maintained his innocence.          After a trial, a jury\n\nconvicted him of use and attempted use of unauthorized access\n\ndevices (count 1) and possession of fifteen or more such devices\n\n(count 2).1 The district court imposed concurrent sentences of\n\neighteen months' imprisonment and two years' supervised release.\n\nThis appeal ensued.\n\nII.   ANALYSIS\n\n           We    consider    the   appellant's   claims    of   error   in\n\nchronological order.        Thus, we start by discussing the district\n\ncourt's denial of the appellant's pretrial motion to suppress.          We\n\nthen turn to the refusal to grant a mistrial.         Finally, we address\n\nthe claim of instructional error.\n\n                      A.    The Suppression Motion.\n\n          In     considering    pretrial   rulings   on   suppression   of\n\nevidence, we review the district court's answers to questions of\n\n\n\n      1\n      The  applicable   statutory   sections  proscribe   conduct\npertaining to unauthorized or counterfeit access devices. See 18\nU.S.C. § 1029(a)(2)-(3), (b)(1). For simplicity's sake, we refer\nhere solely to unauthorized credit cards.\n\n                                    -3-\n\flaw de novo and its findings of fact for clear error.                    United\n\nStates v. Schaefer, 87 F.3d 562, 565 (1st Cir. 1996); United States\n\nv. Zapata, 18 F.3d 971, 975          (1st Cir. 1994).           The ultimate\n\nquestions on which Fourth Amendment inquiries hinge — such as the\n\nreasonableness of a particular detention or the existence vel non\n\nof probable cause — engender plenary review.             Ornelas v. United\n\nStates, 517 U.S. 690, 697-98 (1996).            Absent an error of law, we\n\nwill uphold a refusal to suppress evidence as long as the refusal\n\nis supported by some reasonable view of the record.             United States\n\nv. Campa, 234 F.3d 733, 737 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n           The appellant's suppression claim is fact-specific.              We\n\nrecount   the   relevant   facts    as    the   trial   court    found   them,\n\nconsistent with record support.          See United States v. Chhien, 266\n\nF.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2001).    On the day of the arrest, Salem police\n\nreceived a report of possible credit card fraud at a Service\n\nMerchandise outlet. The store's manager related that a young Asian\n\nmale had tried (but failed) to purchase a $2,300 wristwatch using\n\nnot one but two platinum American Express cards ostensibly issued\n\nin the name of Zhi Lin.            When the attempt failed, both the\n\nprospective purchaser and his cohort — an Asian man wearing a green\n\nshirt and light-colored pants — departed hurriedly and headed for\n\nthe parking lot.\n\n           Officer John Joy responded to the call.          Arriving on the\n\nscene, Joy's attention was drawn to a white van occupied by the\n\n\n                                    -4-\n\fappellant and Manchu He.       The two men matched the broadcast\n\ndescription of the suspects.    Although the van was stopped in the\n\nparking lot, the appellant tried to pull it forward when Joy\n\napproached. Finding the way obstructed, the appellant then put the\n\nvan in reverse and shot back (almost running into Joy's police\n\ncruiser).    Concerned that the men were trying to flee, Joy blocked\n\ntheir path, turned on his blue lights, drew his firearm, and\n\ndirected his canine companion to bark.       When Joy ordered them to\n\nstep out of the van and show their hands, the men complied.        As\n\nsoon as they did so, Joy re-holstered his weapon and silenced the\n\npolice dog.\n\n            At that juncture, four more officers arrived.    Joy told\n\nthe appellant why he had been stopped and assured him that he would\n\nbe free to go if everything \"turned out.\"      He then posed a series\n\nof questions to him.     At the same time, a second officer began\n\ninterrogating He.    In due course, He gave the officer his wallet\n\nand granted him permission to withdraw four pinchbeck cards from\n\nwithin it.    When He admitted that the name on the cards — Zhi Lin\n\n— was not his, the police arrested him.\n\n            Meanwhile, Joy continued to converse with the appellant.\n\nWhen Joy noticed several shopping bags in plain view in the rear of\n\nthe van, he inquired about them.   The appellant confirmed that the\n\nmerchandise belonged to the two men and gave Joy permission to look\n\nfor the corresponding receipts.        A cursory inspection failed to\n\n\n                                 -5-\n\freveal any receipts, and Joy arrested the appellant for receiving\n\nstolen property.\n\n            The appellant thereafter consented to a search of the van\n\nand waived his Miranda rights.          See Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S.\n\n436, 475-79 (1966).        The search proved fruitful:         the police found\n\na cache of fourteen credit cards hidden in two cigarette packs\n\nbehind the driver's seat (some in the name of Zhi Lin and some in\n\nthe name of Yun Wu Chen).              They also recovered receipts for\n\nmerchandise purchases totaling approximately $16,000. The receipts\n\ncorrelated    with    the    goods   found    in   the   van    and    with    the\n\nunauthorized credit cards.\n\n            That afternoon, an employee of a nearby store found in an\n\nadjacent dumpster another four unauthorized credit cards in the\n\nname of Yun Wu Chen, together with some identification documents\n\n(most of which bore the same name).            The employee also reported\n\nthat an Asian male had entered the store earlier that day but had\n\nleft after a few minutes of casual conversation.\n\n             The appellant mounts a three-pronged challenge in a\n\nconcerted    effort   to    suppress    the   fourteen   credit       cards,   the\n\nreceipts, the merchandise, and statements that he made to the\n\npolice.      This challenge assails the constitutionality of the\n\ninvestigatory stop, the propriety of his arrest, and the lawfulness\n\nof the authorities' post-arrest activities.              We deal with these\n\nmatters sequentially.\n\n\n                                       -6-\n\f               1.     The Investigatory Stop.     Warrantless investigatory\n\nstops are allowable if, and to the extent that, police officers\n\nhave a reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing — a suspicion that finds\n\nexpression in specific, articulable reasons for believing that a\n\nperson may be connected to the commission of a particular crime.\n\nTerry v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 21 (1968); United States v. Woodrum, 202\n\nF.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 2000).            In this case, the police officer\n\nrelied on the information in the store manager's account, together\n\nwith what he observed in the parking lot, to draw the inference\n\nthat the appellant and his companion might be involved in the\n\nreported credit card fraud. The district court found this reliance\n\nreasonable and the inference of involvement logical.                   We agree.\n\nThe two men not only were in the right place at the right time but\n\nalso     fit    the     suspects'   descriptions.        This     collocation   of\n\ncircumstances plainly satisfied the reasonable suspicion standard\n\nfor an initial Terry stop. See United States v. Velez-Saldana, 252\n\nF.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir. 2001); United States v. Jones, 187 F.3d 210,\n\n216-17 (1st Cir. 1999).         After all, police officers ordinarily may\n\nemploy    minimally       intrusive   measures    to     effectuate   legitimate\n\ninvestigatory purposes.         See Whren v. United States, 517 U.S. 806,\n\n809-10 (1996); Chhien, 266 F.3d at 6-10.\n\n               A lawful Terry stop may, of course, metamorphose into an\n\noverly    prolonged       or   intrusive     detention    (and,    thus,   become\n\nunlawful).          The appellant raises that specter.       Here, however, as\n\n\n                                       -7-\n\fin United States v. Sowers, 136 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir. 1998), the\n\npassage of time brought with it new knowledge (e.g., the discovery\n\nof the bogus cards in He's wallet and the sighting of the newly\n\nacquired merchandise) that escalated the level of suspicion. These\n\nemergent developments amply justified the continued detention.\n\nChhien, 266 F.3d at 9-10; Sowers, 136 F.3d at 27.\n\n          Contrary to the appellant's importunings, this is not a\n\ncase in which the officers prematurely carried out a de facto\n\narrest. Although there were five officers on the scene, that fact,\n\nwithout more, does not lead inexorably to a conclusion that a de\n\nfacto arrest occurred.    See, e.g., Zapata, 18 F.3d at 975-76;\n\nUnited States v. Quinn, 815 F.2d 153, 157 (1st Cir. 1987).     The\n\nevidence, taken as a whole, adequately supports the district\n\ncourt's finding that, during the interrogation in the parking lot,\n\na reasonable person in the appellant's position would not have\n\nunderstood himself to be in custody.   Thus, the investigatory stop\n\ndid not mutate into the functional equivalent of an arrest.    See\n\nBerkemer v. McCarty, 468 U.S. 420, 442 (1984); Zapata, 18 F.3d at\n\n975.\n\n          In arguing for a different result, the appellant relies\n\nheavily on our decision in United States v. Acosta-Colon, 157 F.3d\n\n9 (1st Cir. 1998).   But the stop that transpired here is cut from\n\ndifferent cloth. Unlike the suspect in Acosta-Colon, id. at 18-20,\n\nthe appellant was neither handcuffed nor confined.       Moreover,\n\n\n                               -8-\n\funlike the suspect in Acosta-Colon, id. at 17-18, the appellant was\n\ndetained and questioned in a public place.    These distinctions are\n\ncritically important in drawing the sometimes elusive line between\n\npermissible investigation and impermissible intrusion.    See Oregon\n\nv. Mathiason, 429 U.S. 492, 494-96 (1977); Zapata, 18 F.3d at 975-\n\n77.\n\n          To be sure, Joy did block the movement of the van and\n\ndraw his firearm — but he did so for a specific, security-related\n\nreason:   he was faced with what appeared to be an attempt at\n\nflight.   This makes a world of difference.    See United States v.\n\nTaylor, 162 F.3d 12, 21 (1st Cir. 1998); see also Acosta-Colon, 157\n\nF.3d at 18-20 (collecting cases).    In all events, actions such as\n\nunholstering a weapon and obstructing a vehicle's path do not, as\n\na matter of law, transmogrify an otherwise lawful Terry stop into\n\na de facto arrest.   See, e.g., United States v. Trueber, 238 F.3d\n\n79, 94 (1st Cir. 2001); Quinn, 815 F.2d at 156-57.          In this\n\ninstance, the totality of the circumstances adequately supports the\n\ndistrict court's finding that the stop lacked the coercive element\n\nnecessary to convert it into something more draconian.\n\n          That ends this aspect of the matter.    The district court\n\ncould, perhaps, have found the facts differently — but it is not\n\nour proper province either to speculate about whether the police\n\nofficers' methods might possibly have been more genteel or to\n\nsecond-guess the district court's assessment of the evidence.   See\n\n\n                               -9-\n\fUnited States v. Sharpe, 470 U.S. 675, 686-87 (1985).                   Mindful of\n\nthese constraints, we uphold the lower court's binary determination\n\nthat reasonable suspicion adequately justified the investigatory\n\nstop   from    its    inception    and    that    the   ensuing   detention     was\n\nsufficiently       restricted     in    its     scope   to   satisfy    applicable\n\nconstitutional limitations.\n\n              2.     The Arrest.        The appellant next challenges the\n\nlegality of his arrest.         His challenge depends upon the existence\n\nvel non of probable cause.\n\n              Probable cause is a fluid concept. Its existence must be\n\nevaluated under the entirety of the circumstances.                     Illinois v.\n\nGates, 462 U.S. 213, 232 (1983); United States v. Figueroa, 818\n\nF.2d 1020, 1024 (1st Cir. 1987).           Probable cause to arrest does not\n\ndemand either the same quantum of proof or the same degree of\n\ncertitude as a conviction.         Probable cause does, however, require\n\nreasonably trustworthy information such as would lead a prudent\n\nperson to believe that the suspect likely had committed or was\n\ncommitting a criminal offense.            See Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 91\n\n(1964); United States v. Winchenbach, 197 F.3d 548, 555 (1st Cir.\n\n1999).\n\n              Probable    cause        often     accretes    gradually     as    an\n\ninvestigation progresses.              So it was here:       we agree with the\n\ndistrict court that the circumstances giving rise to reasonable\n\nsuspicion (recounted above) and the developments that unfolded\n\n\n                                         -10-\n\fduring the Terry stop furnished probable cause for the appellant's\n\narrest.\n\n            The appellant protests that he was arrested primarily\n\nbecause his companion, He, was found in possession of unauthorized\n\ncredit cards.    While it is true that a person's \"mere propinquity\n\nto others independently suspected of criminal activity does not,\n\nwithout more, give rise to probable cause,\" Ybarra v. Illinois, 444\n\nU.S. 85, 91 (1979), there is a considerable difference between mere\n\npropinquity and culpable propinquity.                This is a case in which\n\nculpable propinquity logically could be inferred.\n\n            We rehearse the sequence of events.                  The store manager\n\nhad reported that two Asian men had entered his establishment in\n\nconnection   with     an    attempted      credit   card       fraud.    The   police\n\ndiscovered the appellant in the immediate vicinity of the failed\n\nattempt,    driving    a     van    that     contained     a    large   quantity   of\n\nexpensive, newly acquired merchandise. The man riding with him was\n\nfound to be in possession of unauthorized credit cards (for which\n\nhe was arrested).          To cinch matters, the two men were not merely\n\nnear one another but were traveling companions who satisfied the\n\nstore manager's descriptions and who — by the appellant's own\n\nprearrest    admission       —     jointly    possessed        the   newly   acquired\n\nmerchandise.    Under those circumstances, it strains credulity to\n\nthink that the appellant was unaware that such a large quantity of\n\n\n\n\n                                        -11-\n\fgoods had been obtained through fraud.2              Cf. United States v.\n\nOrtiz, 966 F.2d 707, 712 (1st Cir. 1992) (noting that \"criminals\n\nrarely welcome innocent persons as witnesses to serious crimes and\n\nrarely seek to perpetrate felonies before larger-than-necessary\n\naudiences\").\n\n           The short of it is that, as the investigation progressed,\n\nthe arresting officer developed increasingly good reason to believe\n\nthat substantially more than a momentary, random, or innocent\n\nassociation existed between the appellant and He (and, thus,\n\nbetween   the   appellant   and   the    suspected    criminal   activity).\n\nConsequently,    we   uphold   the      district   court's   finding   that\n\nreasonable suspicion ripened into probable cause, thereby supplying\n\na sound constitutional basis for the ensuing arrest.             See Velez-\n\nSaldana, 252 F.3d at 53; United States v. Martinez-Molina, 64 F.3d\n\n719, 727-30 (1st Cir. 1995).\n\n           3. Post-Arrest Actions. Finally, the appellant suggests\n\nthat the search of his van was beyond the constitutional pale.\n\nThis suggestion lacks force.\n\n           The search was conducted pursuant to the appellant's\n\nexplicit consent, both oral and written.              If that consent was\n\n\n\n     2\n      That the police arrested the appellant for receiving stolen\ngoods rather than for an attempted credit card fraud is of no\nmoment. What counts is that probable cause existed, whether for\nthe charge actually prosecuted or for some other offense that\njustified full custodial detention. See United States v. Bizier,\n111 F.3d 214, 218 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n                                     -12-\n\fvalid, the search was not proscribed under the Fourth Amendment.\n\nSee   Schneckloth   v.   Bustamonte,    412   U.S.   218,   227-29   (1973);\n\nWoodrum, 202 F.3d at 8, 10-11.       Although the appellant claims that\n\nhis consent was vitiated by coercion and lack of comprehension, the\n\nfacts of this case do not support that extravagant claim.\n\n            The record is bereft of any evidence that the police\n\nacted in a false or unduly coercive manner when they obtained the\n\nappellant's consent to the search.            In arguing for a contrary\n\nconclusion, the appellant points principally to the fact that the\n\npolice informed him that, if he did not consent to a search of the\n\nvan, they would simply secure a warrant.        Courts have held, with a\n\nregularity   bordering    on   the    monotonous,    that   this     sort   of\n\nstatement, made in a case in which the facts were sufficient to\n\nsupport the issuance of a search warrant, does not constitute\n\ncoercion.    E.g., Bumper v. N. Carolina, 391 U.S. 543, 549 & n.14\n\n(1968) (collecting cases); United States v. Perez-Montanez, 202\n\nF.3d 434, 438-39 (1st Cir. 2000).\n\n            The record is equally inhospitable to the appellant's\n\nclaim that he lacked comprehension.            While we appreciate that\n\nEnglish is the appellant's second language and that he had the\n\nassistance of an interpreter at trial, he has resided in the United\n\nStates for many years. Perhaps more important, there is nothing in\n\nthe record to indicate that the appellant was unable to understand\n\nJoy's questions, that he had any difficulty in communicating with\n\n\n                                     -13-\n\fthe officers at the scene (or afterwards for that matter), or that\n\nhe    had     any    problem     comprehending      the     consent   form.     These\n\ncircumstances undermine the credibility of any claim that lack of\n\ncomprehension led him down a primrose path.                   See United States v.\n\nAbdullah, 162 F.3d 897, 902 (6th Cir. 1998); United States v.\n\nYusuff, 96 F.3d 982, 986 (7th Cir. 1996).\n\n               We add one final flourish.           The appellant previously had\n\nbeen       convicted      on   other   charges     (e.g.,    possession   of   stolen\n\nproperty).          That circumstance indicates that he had direct, first-\n\nhand experience with law enforcement and militates against a\n\nfinding that he lacked full comprehension of the officers' request\n\nto search the vehicle.            See United States v. Barnett, 989 F.2d 546,\n\n556 (1st Cir. 1993); United States v. Cruz Jimenez, 894 F.2d 1, 8\n\n(1st Cir. 1990).           For all of these reasons, we accept the district\n\ncourt's determination that the               appellant's consent to the search\n\nwas lawfully obtained.3                See Schneckloth, 412 U.S. at 248-49;\n\nChhien, 266 F.3d at 8.\n\n               The appellant also contends that his Miranda waiver and\n\nthe        post-arrest         questioning     that       followed    were     beyond\n\nconstitutional limits.             Because this contention rests on the same\n\ngrounds       as    his   plaint    about    the   supposed     invalidity     of   the\n\n\n       3\n      Given this determination, we need not           address the\ngovernment's alternative arguments that the search was lawful under\nthe automobile exception to the warrant requirement or as an\ninventory search. For the same reason, we need not consider the\napplicability of the doctrine of inevitable discovery.\n\n                                            -14-\n\fvehicular search, we reject it out of hand. Accordingly, we uphold\n\nthe district court's determination that the post-arrest questioning\n\nwas neither unduly coercive nor tainted by lack of comprehension.\n\n            4.     Recapitulation.            We    summarize     succinctly.       We\n\nconclude that the police officer who stopped and questioned the\n\nappellant had reasonable suspicion for doing so; that the scope of\n\nthe stop was within appropriate limits; that by the time the police\n\narrested the appellant, reasonable suspicion had burgeoned into\n\nprobable cause; and that the appellant knowingly and voluntarily\n\nconsented   both    to    a    search    of    the    van   and    to    post-arrest\n\nquestioning.     Consequently, we hold that the lower court did not\n\nerr in denying the appellant's motion to suppress.\n\n                          B.   The Mistrial Motion.\n\n            We turn next to the appellant's assertion that the trial\n\njudge erroneously denied his motion for a mistrial.                     We review the\n\ndenial of a mistrial motion for abuse of discretion. United States\n\nv. Torres, 162 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir. 1998); United States v. Pierro,\n\n32 F.3d 611, 617 (1st Cir. 1994).\n\n            The pertinent facts are not disputed. The district court\n\nhad sustained the appellant's objection to the admission of any\n\nevidence of the discovery of a Taser stun gun in the van.                     See Fed.\n\nR. Evid. 403 (authorizing the court to exclude evidence if its\n\nprobative   value    is    substantially           outweighed     by    its   unfairly\n\n\n\n\n                                        -15-\n\fprejudicial effect).         One of the police officers nevertheless let\n\nslip a mention of the gun during his trial testimony.\n\n            The appellant objected and sought a mistrial.                       The\n\ndistrict court struck the offending portion of the answer and gave\n\nthe jury an emphatic curative instruction:                 \"The stun gun has\n\nnothing to do with this case. . . .           So you should not infer that\n\nthere is anything improper about the presence of the stun gun there\n\nbecause there wasn't, and you should not consider it in your\n\ndeliberations because it had nothing to do with this case.\" Having\n\ntaken these prophylactic measures, the court refused to declare a\n\nmistrial.\n\n            The appellant assigns error to this ruling, asserting\n\nthat no instruction could cure the prejudice inherent in the mere\n\nmention   of   the    stun     gun.   In    his   view,   that    reference,     in\n\nconjunction with Joy's testimony about the appellant's alleged\n\nattempt to flee, inevitably would have led the jury to believe that\n\nthe appellant harbored a propensity for violence.                     The district\n\ncourt rejected this hypothesis.            So do we.\n\n            When a witness strays into forbidden territory, the usual\n\nremedy is to strike the wayward remark and instruct the jury to\n\ndisregard it.     See, e.g., United States v. Bradshaw, 281 F.3d 278,\n\n284 (1st Cir. 2002); Pierro, 32 F.3d at 617.              In all but the rare\n\ncase, that remedy, if properly executed, will suffice to safeguard\n\nthe   aggrieved      party's    rights.      Perscrutation       of    the   record\n\n\n                                      -16-\n\fpersuades us that this case falls within the general rule, not\n\nwithin the   long-odds    exception    to    it.    Four    factors       heavily\n\ninfluence our judgment.\n\n          First, the witness's allusion to the stun gun, taken in\n\ncontext, was rather innocuous. Second, the lower court supportably\n\nfound that   the    comment   was   inadvertent.         Third,    the    court's\n\nresponse was swift and pointed.       It struck the offending reference\n\nand gave a blunt curative instruction on the spot.                The appellant\n\ndid not fault the wording of the instruction at the time and does\n\nnot do so now.     Finally, there is a strong presumption that jurors\n\nwill follow clear instructions from the presiding judge.                      See\n\nTorres, 162 F.3d at 12; United States v. Sepulveda, 15 F.3d 1161,\n\n1185 (1st Cir. 1993).      The record provides us with no basis for\n\ndoubting that the jury did so here.\n\n          In sum, the mention of the stun gun was an isolated\n\nincident, and the trial judge — who saw and heard the witness's\n\nlapsus linguae at first hand and had an opportunity to evaluate the\n\njury's reaction — concluded that the slip was not particularly\n\nconsequential.       Considering    the     whole   of    the     record,    this\n\nconclusion   seems     eminently    reasonable.          Apart     from     sheer\n\nspeculation, there is nothing to suggest that the unfortunate\n\nallusion to the stun gun irretrievably poisoned the well. We hold,\n\ntherefore, that the district court's decision to eschew a mistrial\n\nwas well within the encincture of its discretion.\n\n\n                                    -17-\n\f              C.     The Alleged Instructional Error.\n\n          The appellant's remaining claim relates solely to his\n\nconviction on count 2 of the indictment.    To prove a violation of\n\nthe statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(3), the government\n\nmust show that a defendant \"knowingly and with intent to defraud\n\npossesse[d] fifteen or more . . . counterfeit or unauthorized\n\naccess devices.\"     In this case, the appellant asked the district\n\ncourt to instruct the jurors that they had to agree on which\n\nfifteen devices (i.e., credit cards) were in his possession.    The\n\ncourt refused to do so (although it did grant the appellant's\n\nrequest for a supplemental instruction that required jury unanimity\n\nas to which cards were unauthorized).     The appellant interposed a\n\ntimely objection, see Fed. R. Crim. P. 30(d), and now assigns error\n\nto the trial court's refusal of the desired instruction.\n\n          A party's entitlement to a unanimity instruction presents\n\na question of law.     Consequently, the district court's answer to\n\nthat question engenders de novo review.    United States v. Pitrone,\n\n115 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir. 1997).\n\n          The requirement that a federal jury be unanimous is a\n\nbedrock principle of our criminal jurisprudence. See Richardson v.\n\nUnited States, 526 U.S. 813, 817 (1999); Schad v. Arizona, 501 U.S.\n\n624, 634 n.5 (1991); see generally United States v. Correa-Ventura,\n\n6 F.3d 1070, 1076-82 (5th Cir. 1993) (providing an extensive\n\ndiscussion of the unanimity requirement).    The principle is rooted\n\n\n                                 -18-\n\fin the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const. amend. V, and memorialized\n\nin Fed. R. Crim. P. 31(a).\n\n            The unanimity requirement does not impose a rule that all\n\ntwelve jurors in a federal criminal case must agree on every last\n\ndetail.     Sovereigns define crimes by enumerating their factual\n\nelements, and the unanimity requirement attaches to those elements.\n\nSee Richardson, 526 U.S. at 817; Johnson v. Louisiana, 406 U.S.\n\n356, 369-71 (1972) (Powell, J., concurring).               To that extent — and\n\nonly to that extent — unanimity is an indispensable condition\n\nprecedent    to   a   conviction.     As     Justice   Blackmun    once    wrote,\n\n\"different jurors may be persuaded by different pieces of evidence,\n\neven when they agree upon the bottom line.                 Plainly there is no\n\ngeneral     requirement    that     the    jury    reach    agreement     on   the\n\npreliminary factual issues which underlie the verdict.\"                 McKoy v.\n\nN. Carolina, 494 U.S. 433, 449 (1990) (Blackmun, J., concurring).\n\nThus, if a jury is confronted with divergent factual theories in\n\nsupport of the same ultimate issue, courts generally have held that\n\nthe unanimity requirement is met as long as the jurors are in\n\nagreement on the ultimate issue (even though they may not be\n\nunanimous as to the precise theory).              See Richardson, 526 U.S. at\n\n817; Schad, 501 U.S. at 631-32; United States v. Hernandez-Albino,\n\n177 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\n            At this level of generality, the unanimity requirement\n\nserves several salutary purposes.             For one thing, it helps to\n\n\n                                      -19-\n\fensure that no defendant will be convicted unless the government\n\nhas carried its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nSee Correa-Ventura, 6 F.3d at 1076-77.                For another thing, it\n\nfunctions as a corollary of due process rules against duplicity.\n\nSee United States v. Verrecchia, 196 F.3d 294, 297 (1st Cir. 1999).\n\nFinally, it serves to protect defendants against the vagueness and\n\nimprecision that haunt some criminal statutes. See Schad, 501 U.S.\n\nat 632-33; United States v. Edmonds, 80 F.3d 810, 819 (3d Cir.\n\n1996).\n\n          Withal, the unanimity requirement is more easily stated\n\nthan applied.    The question is one of degree — and the devil is in\n\nthe details.      Due process demands that a jury must come to\n\nagreement on the principal facts underlying its verdict — what\n\ncourts have tended to call the elements of the offense.                   But that\n\nrequirement    does   not   extend      to   subsidiary     facts   —    what   the\n\nRichardson Court has called \"brute facts.\" Richardson, 526 U.S. at\n\n817-18; accord Schad, 501 U.S. at 632.              There is no well defined\n\nroadmap to follow in separating the wheat (the elements of an\n\noffense) from the chaff (the brute facts that constitute those\n\nelements).      Rather,     we   must    navigate    this    course      by   using\n\nguideposts that emanate from \"a distillate of the concept of due\n\nprocess with its demands for fundamental fairness.\"                     Schad, 501\n\nU.S. at 637.\n\n\n\n\n                                     -20-\n\f            It is thus apparent that, to resolve this dilemma, an\n\ninquiring court must distinguish the elements of a charged offense\n\nfrom the brute facts that constitute those elements, mindful that\n\nthe unanimity requirement attaches only to the former and not to\n\nthe latter.    Richardson, 526 U.S. at 817-18.        This taxonomy has\n\nimportant ramifications for the criminal justice system.           On the\n\none hand, requiring unanimity on relatively minor details will\n\nhamstring   the    government's    ability   to   prosecute   crimes   and\n\nencourage hung juries.      On the other hand, leaving jurors free to\n\nconvict despite disagreements about critical facts will imperil the\n\nintegrity of the reasonable doubt standard.\n\n            Against this backdrop, we return to the case at hand.\n\nHere, the district court gave a general instruction on unanimity.\n\nIt required the jury, in effect, to agree that the appellant\n\npossessed   fifteen    or   more   unauthorized   credit   cards   without\n\nrequiring agreement as to the identity of those fifteen cards. The\n\npivotal question, therefore, is whether the unanimity requirement\n\nextends to which fifteen credit cards the appellant possessed. The\n\nanswer to this question depends on whether the identity of the\n\ncredit cards that the appellant possessed is a fact strictly\n\nnecessary to define the conduct prohibited under the statute of\n\nconviction.       See Schad, 501 U.S. at 630-31; United States v.\n\nJackson, 879 F.2d 85, 88-89 (3d Cir. 1989).       In other words, is the\n\n\n\n\n                                    -21-\n\fidentity of the particular fifteen credit cards an element of the\n\noffense or merely a fact used to prove an element?4\n\n               Ascertainment of the level at which unanimity is required\n\nin order to convict a defendant of a particular crime tends to be\n\noffense-specific.        See Richardson, 526 U.S. at 817-18; Correa-\n\nVentura, 6 F.3d at 1081.        Thus, a determination of the extent to\n\nwhich jury unanimity is required begins — and sometimes ends — with\n\nthe text of the statute of conviction.           See Richardson, 526 U.S. at\n\n818.       Where, as here, the text does not furnish decisive guidance,\n\nan inquiring court must comb the statutory language for clues,\n\nconsider relevant legal traditions, look at the overall structure\n\nof the law, examine the statute's legislative history, and mull the\n\nimplications for unfairness (if any) associated with the absence of\n\na specific unanimity requirement.          See id. at 819-20; Schad, 501\n\nU.S. at 637-38.\n\n               The preeminent clues that infiltrate the language of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1029(a)(3) are derived from the statute's narrow compass\n\nand    its    relative   specificity.      The   statute   identifies   facts\n\nnecessary to ground a conviction — possession of fifteen or more\n\n\n       4\n      We emphasize that this question has practical consequences in\nthe circumstances of this case. The jury heard evidence about a\ntotal of twenty-two bogus credit cards. These included fourteen\ncredit cards found in the van, four retrieved from He's wallet, and\nfour discovered in the dumpster. The jury supportably could have\ndetermined that the appellant actually or constructively possessed\nany or all of them.      Thus, individual jurors might have used\ndifferent combinations to attribute a figure of fifteen or more\ncards to the appellant.\n\n                                    -22-\n\fcounterfeit or unauthorized access devices — with considerable\n\nprecision and channels jury deliberations within well delineated\n\nconfines.       These features distinguish section 1029(a)(3) from 21\n\nU.S.C. § 848 (the statute at issue in Richardson).                   The latter\n\nstatute     criminalizes    the   conduct      of   a    continuing    criminal\n\nenterprise (CCE) and, in so doing, uses as a jumping-off point the\n\ncommission of any series of included felonies (out of numerous\n\npossible choices).\n\n            The Richardson Court found that the broad and non-\n\nspecific nature of section 848 — a statute that lists approximately\n\nninety numbered sections of the federal criminal code as potential\n\nserial    offenses    —   engenders    an     unacceptable    risk    of   juror\n\ndisagreement as to which series of violations a defendant actually\n\nhad committed.       526 U.S. at 819.        This risk is magnified because\n\nthe statute fails to channel jury deliberations toward a specific\n\nset of circumstances, thus creating a danger that a jury might\n\nconvict a defendant unfairly on the basis of his bad reputation\n\nalone.    Id.    To allay these risks, the Court imposed a requirement\n\nof jury unanimity as to which continuing series of violations a\n\ndefendant actually committed.         Id. at 824.\n\n            Section 1029(a)(3) does not pose either the same type or\n\ndegree of risk.      While the CCE statute is broad and non-specific,\n\nsection 1029(a)(3) is narrow and specific.              Its precise account of\n\nthe facts necessary to ground a conviction means that jurors, even\n\n\n                                      -23-\n\fwithout a particularized unanimity instruction, are hardly likely\n\nto convict if they cannot reach agreement as to the principal\n\nfactual elements referable to a given charge.      See McKoy, 494 U.S.\n\nat 449 n.5 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (collecting cases); cf.\n\nVerrecchia, 196 F.3d at 301 (suggesting that when the issue is\n\npossession vel non of a specific type of contraband, the potential\n\nfor   juror    disagreement   is   mitigated).     Moreover,     section\n\n1029(a)(3), unlike the CCE statute, channels jury deliberations\n\ntoward a particular set of circumstances. A jury dealing with such\n\na statute is unlikely to convict out of a belief that the defendant\n\nwas doing some non-specific (but obviously bad) act.\n\n             History and tradition also help to distinguish section\n\n1029(a)(3) from the CCE statute. The term \"violation,\" used in the\n\nCCE statute, always has had independent legal significance; thus,\n\nwhether certain conduct amounts to a violation is a matter that\n\ntypically requires jury unanimity.        See Richardson, 526 U.S. at\n\n818-19; Edmonds, 80 F.3d at 822.     In contrast, the phrase \"fifteen\n\nor more,\" used in section 1029(a)(3), has no independent legal\n\nsignificance.     That phrase simply refers to the nature of the\n\nproscribed    possession.     Consequently,   it   evokes   no   similar\n\ntradition of jury unanimity.\n\n          In these respects, section 1029(a)(3) is very different\n\nfrom the CCE statute.    The more apt comparison is between section\n\n1029(a)(3) and 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (the statute at issue in\n\n\n                                   -24-\n\fVerrecchia). Section 922(g)(1) criminalizes the possession of \"any\n\nfirearm\" by a previously convicted felon.        Id.   The district court\n\nfailed to give an instruction requiring jury unanimity as to which\n\nfirearm the defendant allegedly possessed. Verrecchia, 196 F.3d at\n\n296-97. On plain error review we approved this omission, reasoning\n\nthat jurors who agreed that the defendant possessed a firearm but\n\ndisagreed as to which firearm he possessed nonetheless would be\n\nunanimous on the relevant element of the offense:             possession of\n\n\"any firearm.\"    Id. at 299.   So it is here.      Jurors who agreed that\n\nthe appellant possessed fifteen unauthorized credit cards but\n\ndisagreed as to which fifteen nonetheless would be unanimous on the\n\nrelevant element of the offense:         possession of \"fifteen or more\n\n. . . devices.\"   The use of non-specific terms such as \"any\" or \"or\n\nmore\" indicates that Congress's emphasis was not on the identity of\n\nthe actual items (whether firearms or credit cards), but, rather,\n\non the possession thereof.      See id.\n\n           An examination of the structure of section 1029 fortifies\n\nour belief that the identity of the particular credit cards should\n\nnot be deemed an element of the offense.         That global view leaves\n\na clear impression that Congress intended to target fraudulent\n\naccess crimes of a particular scope, such as those surpassing\n\ncertain   value   thresholds,   see,   e.g.,   18    U.S.C.   §   1029(a)(5)\n\n(criminalizing the knowing use of one or more access devices, with\n\nintent to defraud, in order to receive more than $1,000 in a one-\n\n\n                                  -25-\n\fyear period), or those involving technologies fraudulently used to\n\nproduce or verify access devices, see, e.g., id. § 1029(a)(4)\n\n(criminalizing the possession, production, or use of device-making\n\nequipment).    The graduated penalty provisions of section 1029, see\n\nid. § 1029(c), also are consistent with a focus on the scope of the\n\nfraudulent    conduct.5   This    emphasis   on   scope   indicates    that\n\nCongress most likely regarded the number of unauthorized credit\n\ncards — \"fifteen or more\" — rather than their identity as the\n\nrelevant element of the offense.     Cf. Verrecchia, 196 F.3d at 299-\n\n300 (requiring no unanimity as to which firearm defendant possessed\n\nbecause the statutory focus lies elsewhere).\n\n            The strength of this conclusion is not attenuated by the\n\nfact that Congress sought to link culpability to both the nature\n\nand number of associated devices through extensive definitions as\n\nto what constitutes counterfeit or unauthorized devices.               See,\n\ne.g., 18 U.S.C. § 1029(e)(1)-(3).        The statute provides no detail\n\nas to how these devices must be possessed.        See id. § 1029(e).     By\n\nthe same token, it does not otherwise supply a reason why a jury\n\nshould be required to agree on exactly which fifteen cards a\n\ndefendant    possessed.   These    are   strong   indications   that    the\n\nidentity of the credit cards was not meant to be an element of the\n\noffense.    See Verrecchia, 196 F.3d at 300-01 (undertaking the same\n\n\n     5\n      This graduated progression based solely on scope is uniform,\nsave for an exception relating to recidivism.     See 18 U.S.C. §\n1029(c)(1)(B).\n\n                                  -26-\n\ftype of analysis, and reaching the same conclusion, with respect to\n\nthe felon-in-possession statute).\n\n           The    legislative      history    of       section   1029(a)    further\n\nbuttresses our intuition that section 1029 focuses on the scope of\n\nthe crime of possession as a whole, as opposed to focusing on each\n\nact of possession comprised within that whole.                 Enacted to augment\n\nthe Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. § 1644, and the\n\nElectronic     Funds    Transfer    Act,    id.    §    1693n(b),     in   combating\n\nincreasingly sophisticated types of fraudulent practices, section\n\n1029   expanded    the     armamentarium          available      to   federal    law\n\nenforcement authorities by criminalizing the mere possession of\n\ncounterfeit or unauthorized access devices.                 See H.R. Rep. No. 98-\n\n894, at 5 (1984), reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3691; see\n\nalso Theresa L. Kruk, Annotation, What Constitutes Violation of 18\n\nU.S.C.A.   §    1029,    Prohibiting       Fraud       or   Related   Activity   in\n\nConnection with Credit Card or Other Credit Access Device, 115\n\nA.L.R. Fed. 213 (1993).            Congress incorporated the \"fifteen or\n\nmore\" minimum and the $1,000 monetary threshold as jurisdictional\n\nelements, presumably in order to ensure that the weight of the\n\nfederal government would be brought to bear on more sophisticated\n\nand larger-scale fraudulent schemes (where federal resources can\n\nbest supplement state and local law enforcement efforts). See H.R.\n\nRep. 98-894, supra, at 5, reprinted in 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3691.\n\nThese factors suggest that the identity of the particular \"fifteen\n\n\n                                      -27-\n\for more\" credit cards is not an element of the offense described in\n\nsection 1029(a)(3), but, rather, encompasses brute facts incident\n\nto that offense.\n\n           In an endeavor to refute this suggestion, the appellant\n\nrefers us to a line of cases holding that access devices possessed\n\nover different periods of time cannot be aggregated to meet the\n\nnumerical requirement of section 1029(a)(3).     See, e.g., United\n\nStates v. Powell, 973 F.2d 885, 890 (10th Cir. 1992); United States\n\nv. Russell, 908 F.2d 405, 406-07 (8th Cir. 1990).          Far from\n\nsubverting our conclusion, these decisions simply illustrate that\n\nthe phrase \"fifteen or more . . . devices\" defines the scope of a\n\nsingle crime; given the indications we have noted, that phrase\n\ncannot coherently be read as an attempt to aggregate separate\n\ncrimes.    Thus, Powell and Russell confirm a part of our basic\n\npremise:   the statute of conviction targets crimes of a certain\n\nscope. In other words, the crime defined by 18 U.S.C. § 1029(a)(3)\n\nis not fifteen acts of possessing an unauthorized credit card, but,\n\nrather, a single act of possession of fifteen such devices.\n\n           A comparison of section 1029(a)(3) with other statutes of\n\nsimilar structure bolsters this conclusion.    Typically, statutory\n\nelements that require a jury to find a specific quantity of a\n\nsubstance or thing do not demand unanimity as to which items make\n\nup that quantity.    See, e.g., United States v. Kayode, 254 F.3d\n\n204, 214 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (refusing to require unanimity, in a\n\n\n                                -28-\n\fprosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 1028(a)(3), as to which five or more\n\nidentification documents a defendant possessed); United States v.\n\nNicolaou, 180 F.3d 565, 571-72 (4th Cir. 1999) (refusing to require\n\nunanimity, in a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. § 1955(b)(1)(ii), as to\n\nwhich five or more persons participated in an illegal gambling\n\nbusiness). Indeed, Richardson helps to prove this point. Although\n\nthe Court demanded unanimity as to which predicate offenses the\n\ndefendant committed, it suggested that, as to a different aspect of\n\nthe CCE statute, 21 U.S.C. § 848(c)(2)(A), unanimity might not be\n\nrequired as to which \"five or more other persons\" the defendant\n\nsupervised.   See Richardson, 526 U.S. at 824.   In this regard, the\n\nCourt noted that the language, breadth, and tradition of the two\n\nfactual requirements differed significantly. See id.; see also id.\n\nat 829 (Kennedy, J., dissenting); United States v. Tarvers, 833\n\nF.2d 1068, 1074-75 (1st Cir. 1987) (holding expressly that, in a\n\nprosecution under 21 U.S.C. § 848, unanimity is not required as to\n\nthe identity of the persons supervised).\n\n          Finally, we note that potential juror disagreement on the\n\nidentity of the credit cards possessed does not risk serious\n\nunfairness in contravention of a defendant's constitutional rights.\n\nAs the structure and legislative history of section 1029 evince,\n\nthe statute targets fraudulent ventures of a certain size and\n\nscope.   This emphasis might, in some circumstances, increase the\n\nchance of an unfair conviction in the absence of a specific\n\n\n                               -29-\n\funanimity    requirement.               See    Richardson,         526      U.S.   at   819;\n\nVerrrecchia,      196       F.3d   at   301.         Here,    however,      the    statute's\n\nlanguage is very precise as to the factual basis of the proscribed\n\nconduct.    This precision, in turn, commands consensus on a number\n\nof   important    facts       directly        linked    to     the   culpability        of   a\n\ndefendant's conduct. That feature significantly mitigates the risk\n\nof substantial jury disagreement. See United States v. Davis, 306\n\nF.3d 398, 414 (6th Cir. 2002) (refusing to require unanimity on the\n\nmeans by    which       a    defendant      violated         the   aiding    and    abetting\n\nstatute, 18 U.S.C. § 2, because of the statute's \"finite terms\");\n\nVerrecchia, 196 F.3d at 301 (concluding that the precision of 18\n\nU.S.C. § 922(g)(1) reduces the potential for unfairness and, thus,\n\nreduces     the    need        for      a   specific         unanimity       requirement).\n\nConsequently, we do not believe that the absence of a unanimity\n\ninstruction anent the identity of the devices possessed has adverse\n\nimplications for the fairness of potential convictions under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1029(a)(3).\n\n            We need go no further.               Having completed our canvass of\n\nthe appropriate points of reference, we conclude that the identity\n\nof the particular devices possessed by a defendant is not an\n\nelement necessary to prove the culpable act of possession under 18\n\nU.S.C. § 1029(a)(3).           Accordingly, that statute does not require a\n\njury, as a condition precedent to conviction, to reach unanimous\n\nagreement as to which access devices a defendant possessed.                                  It\n\n\n                                              -30-\n\ffollows inexorably that the district court did not err in refusing\n\nto give the instruction sought by the appellant.\n\n\n\nAffirmed.\n\n\n\n\n                              -31-\n\f",

Colantuono, United States Attorney, was on brief, for appellee.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Before SELYA, Circuit Judge, COFFIN and BOWNES, Senior Circuit Judges.</p>\n      <p class=\"indent\">SELYA, Circuit Judge.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p1\">\n      <span class=\"num\">1</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In this case, a jury convicted defendant-appellant Ngai Man Lee of, inter alia, possession of fifteen or more unauthorized credit cards (known in the statutory argot as \"access devices\"). On appeal, Lee argues that the district court erred in failing to require jury unanimity as to which fifteen credit cards he possessed. The question is one of first impression at the federal appellate level. Upon reflection, we conclude that the district court appropriately rejected the proffered jury instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p2\">\n      <span class=\"num\">2</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also advances two other assignments of error, namely, (1) that the police officers who questioned and arrested him did so in derogation of his constitutional rights, and (2) that a prejudicial remark uttered at trial demanded the declaration of a mistrial (a course of action eschewed by the district court). We reject, more easily, these assignments of error. When all is said and done, we affirm the judgment below.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">I. BACKGROUND</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p3\">\n      <span class=\"num\">3</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We sketch the factual background and the travel of the case. We reserve a fuller discussion of particular facts for our analysis of the appellant's suppression claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p4\">\n      <span class=\"num\">4</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">On September 5, 2001 an employee of an emporium in Salem, New Hampshire reported an attempted credit card fraud. Police officers responded to the shopping plaza where the store was located. They eventually stopped, questioned, and arrested both the appellant and a companion. A total of twenty-two unauthorized credit cards were found in the companion's wallet, the van in which the suspects had been riding, and a dumpster adjacent to a nearby store.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p5\">\n      <span class=\"num\">5</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In due season, a federal grand jury indicted both men. The companion pleaded guilty and his case is not now before us. The appellant maintained his innocence. After a trial, a jury convicted him of use and attempted use of unauthorized access devices (count 1) and possession of fifteen or more such devices (count 2).<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fn1_ref\">1</a> The district court imposed concurrent sentences of eighteen months' imprisonment and two years' supervised release. This appeal ensued.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"indent\">II. ANALYSIS</p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p6\">\n      <span class=\"num\">6</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We consider the appellant's claims of error in chronological order. Thus, we start by discussing the district court's denial of the appellant's pretrial motion to suppress. We then turn to the refusal to grant a mistrial. Finally, we address the claim of instructional error.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">A. <i>The Suppression Motion.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p7\">\n      <span class=\"num\">7</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In considering pretrial rulings on suppression of evidence, we review the district court's answers to questions of law de novo and its findings of fact for clear error. <i>United States v. Schaefer,</i> 87 F.3d 562, 565 (1st Cir.1996); <i>United States v. Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d 971, 975 (1st Cir.1994). The ultimate questions on which Fourth Amendment inquiries hinge &#8212; such as the reasonableness of a particular detention or the existence <i>vel non</i> of probable cause &#8212; engender plenary review. <i>Ornelas v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 690, 697-98, 116 S.Ct. 1657, 134 L.Ed.2d 911 (1996). Absent an error of law, we will uphold a refusal to suppress evidence as long as the refusal is supported by some reasonable view of the record. <i>United States v. Campa,</i> 234 F.3d 733, 737 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p8\">\n      <span class=\"num\">8</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's suppression claim is fact-specific. We recount the relevant facts as the trial court found them, consistent with record support. <i>See United States v. Chhien,</i> 266 F.3d 1, 8 (1st Cir. 2001). On the day of the arrest, Salem police received a report of possible credit card fraud at a Service Merchandise outlet. The store's manager related that a young Asian male had tried (but failed) to purchase a $2,300 wristwatch using not one but two platinum American Express cards ostensibly issued in the name of Zhi Lin. When the attempt failed, both the prospective purchaser and his cohort &#8212; an Asian man wearing a green shirt and lightcolored pants &#8212; departed hurriedly and headed for the parking lot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer John Joy responded to the call. Arriving on the scene, Joy's attention was drawn to a white van occupied by the appellant and Manchu He. The two men matched the broadcast description of the suspects. Although the van was stopped in the parking lot, the appellant tried to pull it forward when Joy approached. Finding the way obstructed, the appellant then put the van in reverse and shot back (almost running into Joy's police cruiser). Concerned that the men were trying to flee, Joy blocked their path, turned on his blue lights, drew his firearm, and directed his canine companion to bark. When Joy ordered them to step out of the van and show their hands, the men complied. As soon as they did so, Joy re-holstered his weapon and silenced the police dog.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that juncture, four more officers arrived. Joy told the appellant why he had been stopped and assured him that he would be free to go if everything \"turned out.\" He then posed a series of questions to him. At the same time, a second officer began interrogating He. In due course, He gave the officer his wallet and granted him permission to withdraw four pinchbeck cards from within it. When He admitted that the name on the cards &#8212; Zhi Lin &#8212; was not his, the police arrested him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Joy continued to converse with the appellant. When Joy noticed several shopping bags in plain view in the rear of the van, he inquired about them. The appellant confirmed that the merchandise belonged to the two men and gave Joy permission to look for the corresponding receipts. A cursory inspection failed to reveal any receipts, and Joy arrested the appellant for receiving stolen property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant thereafter consented to a search of the van and waived his <i>Miranda</i> rights. <i>See Miranda v. Arizona,</i> 384 U.S. 436, 475-79, 86 S.Ct. 1602, 16 L.Ed.2d 694 (1966). The search proved fruitful: the police found a cache of fourteen credit cards hidden in two cigarette packs behind the driver's seat (some in the name of Zhi Lin and some in the name of Yun Wu Chen). They also recovered receipts for merchandise purchases totaling approximately $16,000. The receipts correlated with the goods found in the van and with the unauthorized credit cards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That afternoon, an employee of a nearby store found in an adjacent dumpster another four unauthorized credit cards in the name of Yun Wu Chen, together with some identification documents (most of which bore the same name). The employee also reported that an Asian male had entered the store earlier that day but had left after a few minutes of casual conversation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant mounts a three-pronged challenge in a concerted effort to suppress the fourteen credit cards, the receipts, the merchandise, and statements that he made to the police. This challenge assails the constitutionality of the investigatory stop, the propriety of his arrest, and the lawfulness of the authorities' post-arrest activities. We deal with these matters sequentially.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p15\">\n      <span class=\"num\">15</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">1. <i>The Investigatory Stop.</i> Warrantless investigatory stops are allowable if, and to the extent that, police officers have a reasonable suspicion of wrongdoing &#8212; a suspicion that finds expression in specific, articulable reasons for believing that a person may be connected to the commission of a particular crime. <i>Terry v. Ohio,</i> 392 U.S. 1, 21, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968); <i>United States v. Woodrum,</i> 202 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir.2000). In this case, the police officer relied on the information in the store manager's account, together with what he observed in the parking lot, to draw the inference that the appellant and his companion might be involved in the reported credit card fraud. The district court found this reliance reasonable and the inference of involvement logical. We agree. The two men not only were in the right place at the right time but also fit the suspects' descriptions. This collocation of circumstances plainly satisfied the reasonable suspicion standard for an initial <i>Terry</i> stop. <i>See United States v. Velez-Saldana,</i> 252 F.3d 49, 53 (1st Cir.2001); <i>United States v. Jones,</i> 187 F.3d 210, 216-17 (1st Cir.1999). After all, police officers ordinarily may employ minimally intrusive measures to effectuate legitimate investigatory purposes. <i>See Whren v. United States,</i> 517 U.S. 806, 809-10, 116 S.Ct. 1769, 135 L.Ed.2d 89 (1996); <i>Chhien,</i> 266 F.3d at 6-10.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p16\">\n      <span class=\"num\">16</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A lawful <i>Terry</i> stop may, of course, metamorphose into an overly prolonged or intrusive detention (and, thus, become unlawful). The appellant raises that specter. Here, however, as in <i>United States v. Sowers,</i> 136 F.3d 24, 27 (1st Cir.1998), the passage of time brought with it new knowledge (e.g., the discovery of the bogus cards in He's wallet and the sighting of the newly acquired merchandise) that escalated the level of suspicion. These emergent developments amply justified the continued detention. <i>Chhien,</i> 266 F.3d at 9-10; <i>Sowers,</i> 136 F.3d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the appellant's importunings, this is not a case in which the officers prematurely carried out a de facto arrest. Although there were five officers on the scene, that fact, without more, does not lead inexorably to a conclusion that a de facto arrest occurred. <i>See, e.g., Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d at 975-76; <i>United States v. Quinn,</i> 815 F.2d 153, 157 (1st Cir.1987). The evidence, taken as a whole, adequately supports the district court's finding that, during the interrogation in the parking lot, a reasonable person in the appellant's position would not have understood himself to be in custody. Thus, the investigatory stop did not mutate into the functional equivalent of an arrest. <i>See Berkemer v. McCarty,</i> 468 U.S. 420, 442, 104 S.Ct. 3138, 82 L.Ed.2d 317 (1984); <i>Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d at 975.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p18\">\n      <span class=\"num\">18</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In arguing for a different result, the appellant relies heavily on our decision in <i>United States v. Acosta-Colon,</i> 157 F.3d 9 (1st Cir.1998). But the stop that transpired here is cut from different cloth. Unlike the suspect in <i>Acosta-Colon, id.</i> at 18-20, the appellant was neither handcuffed nor confined. Moreover, unlike the suspect in <i>Acosta-Colon, id.</i> at 17-18, the appellant was detained and questioned in a public place. These distinctions are critically important in drawing the sometimes elusive line between permissible investigation and impermissible intrusion. <i>See Oregon v. Mathiason,</i> 429 U.S. 492, 494-96, 97 S.Ct. 711, 50 L.Ed.2d 714 (1977); <i>Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d at 975-77.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p19\">\n      <span class=\"num\">19</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">To be sure, Joy did block the movement of the van and draw his firearm &#8212; but he did so for a specific, security-related reason: he was faced with what appeared to be an attempt at flight. This makes a world of difference. <i>See United States v. Taylor,</i> 162 F.3d 12, 21 (1st Cir.1998); <i>see also Acosta-Colon,</i> 157 F.3d at 18-20 (collecting cases). In all events, actions such as unholstering a weapon and obstructing a vehicle's path do not, as a matter of law, transmogrify an otherwise lawful <i>Terry</i> stop into a de facto arrest. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Trueber,</i> 238 F.3d 79, 94 (1st Cir.2001); <i>Quinn,</i> 815 F.2d at 156-57. In this instance, the totality of the circumstances adequately supports the district court's finding that the stop lacked the coercive element necessary to convert it into something more draconian.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p20\">\n      <span class=\"num\">20</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That ends this aspect of the matter. The district court could, perhaps, have found the facts differently &#8212; but it is not our proper province either to speculate about whether the police officers' methods might possibly have been more genteel or to second-guess the district court's assessment of the evidence. <i>See United States v. Sharpe,</i> 470 U.S. 675, 686-87, 105 S.Ct. 1568, 84 L.Ed.2d 605 (1985). Mindful of these constraints, we uphold the lower court's binary determination that reasonable suspicion adequately justified the investigatory stop from its inception and that the ensuing detention was sufficiently restricted in its scope to satisfy applicable constitutional limitations.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p21\">\n      <span class=\"num\">21</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">2. <i>The Arrest.</i> The appellant next challenges the legality of his arrest. His challenge depends upon the existence <i>vel non</i> of probable cause.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p22\">\n      <span class=\"num\">22</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Probable cause is a fluid concept. Its existence must be evaluated under the entirety of the circumstances. <i>Illinois v. Gates,</i> 462 U.S. 213, 232, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983); <i>United States v. Figueroa,</i> 818 F.2d 1020, 1024 (1st Cir.1987). Probable cause to arrest does not demand either the same quantum of proof or the same degree of certitude as a conviction. Probable cause does, however, require reasonably trustworthy information such as would lead a prudent person to believe that the suspect likely had committed or was committing a criminal offense. <i>See Beck v. Ohio,</i> 379 U.S. 89, 91, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964); <i>United States v. Winchenbach,</i> 197 F.3d 548, 555 (1st Cir. 1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p23\">\n      <span class=\"num\">23</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Probable cause often accretes gradually as an investigation progresses. So it was here: we agree with the district court that the circumstances giving rise to reasonable suspicion (recounted above) and the developments that unfolded during the <i>Terry</i> stop furnished probable cause for the appellant's arrest.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p24\">\n      <span class=\"num\">24</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant protests that he was arrested primarily because his companion, He, was found in possession of unauthorized credit cards. While it is true that a person's \"mere propinquity to others independently suspected of criminal activity does not, without more, give rise to probable cause,\" <i>Ybarra v. Illinois,</i> 444 U.S. 85, 91, 100 S.Ct. 338, 62 L.Ed.2d 238 (1979), there is a considerable difference between mere propinquity and culpable propinquity. This is a case in which culpable propinquity logically could be inferred.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p25\">\n      <span class=\"num\">25</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We rehearse the sequence of events. The store manager had reported that two Asian men had entered his establishment in connection with an attempted credit card fraud. The police discovered the appellant in the immediate vicinity of the failed attempt, driving a van that contained a large quantity of expensive, newly acquired merchandise. The man riding with him was found to be in possession of unauthorized credit cards (for which he was arrested). To cinch matters, the two men were not merely near one another but were traveling companions who satisfied the store manager's descriptions and who &#8212; by the appellant's own prearrest admission &#8212; jointly possessed the newly acquired merchandise. Under those circumstances, it strains credulity to think that the appellant was unaware that such a large quantity of goods had been obtained through fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Cf. United States v. Ortiz,</i> 966 F.2d 707, 712 (1st Cir.1992) (noting that \"criminals rarely welcome innocent persons as witnesses to serious crimes and rarely seek to perpetrate felonies before larger-than-necessary audiences\").</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p26\">\n      <span class=\"num\">26</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The short of it is that, as the investigation progressed, the arresting officer developed increasingly good reason to believe that substantially more than a momentary, random, or innocent association existed between the appellant and He (and, thus, between the appellant and the suspected criminal activity). Consequently, we uphold the district court's finding that reasonable suspicion ripened into probable cause, thereby supplying a sound constitutional basis for the ensuing arrest. <i>See Velez-Saldana,</i> 252 F.3d at 53; <i>United States v. Martinez-Molina,</i> 64 F.3d 719, 727-30 (1st Cir.1995).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p27\">\n      <span class=\"num\">27</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">3. <i>Post-Arrest Actions.</i> Finally, the appellant suggests that the search of his van was beyond the constitutional pale. This suggestion lacks force.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p28\">\n      <span class=\"num\">28</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The search was conducted pursuant to the appellant's explicit consent, both oral and written. If that consent was valid, the search was not proscribed under the Fourth Amendment. <i>See Schneckloth v. Bustamonte,</i> 412 U.S. 218, 227-29, 93 S.Ct. 2041, 36 L.Ed.2d 854 (1973); <i>Woodrum,</i> 202 F.3d at 8, 10-11. Although the appellant claims that his consent was vitiated by coercion and lack of comprehension, the facts of this case do not support that extravagant claim.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p29\">\n      <span class=\"num\">29</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is bereft of any evidence that the police acted in a false or unduly coercive manner when they obtained the appellant's consent to the search. In arguing for a contrary conclusion, the appellant points principally to the fact that the police informed him that, if he did not consent to a search of the van, they would simply secure a warrant. Courts have held, with a regularity bordering on the monotonous, that this sort of statement, made in a case in which the facts were sufficient to support the issuance of a search warrant, does not constitute coercion. <i>E.g., Bumper v. N. Carolina,</i> 391 U.S. 543, 549 &amp; n. 14, 88 S.Ct. 1788, 20 L.Ed.2d 797 (1968) (collecting cases); <i>United States v. Perez-Montanez,</i> 202 F.3d 434, 438-39 (1st Cir.2000).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p30\">\n      <span class=\"num\">30</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The record is equally inhospitable to the appellant's claim that he lacked comprehension. While we appreciate that English is the appellant's second language and that he had the assistance of an interpreter at trial, he has resided in the United States for many years. Perhaps more important, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the appellant was unable to understand Joy's questions, that he had any difficulty in communicating with the officers at the scene (or afterwards for that matter), or that he had any problem comprehending the consent form. These circumstances undermine the credibility of any claim that lack of comprehension led him down a primrose path. <i>See United States v. Abdullah,</i> 162 F.3d 897, 902 (6th Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Yusuff,</i> 96 F.3d 982, 986 (7th Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p31\">\n      <span class=\"num\">31</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We add one final flourish. The appellant previously had been convicted on other charges (e.g., possession of stolen property). That circumstance indicates that he had direct, first-hand experience with law enforcement and militates against a finding that he lacked full comprehension of the officers' request to search the vehicle. <i>See United States v. Barnett,</i> 989 F.2d 546, 556 (1st Cir.1993); <i>United States v. Cruz Jimenez,</i> 894 F.2d 1, 8 (1st Cir.1990). For all of these reasons, we accept the district court's determination that the appellant's consent to the search was lawfully obtained.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fn3_ref\">3</a> <i>See Schneckloth,</i> 412 U.S. at 248-49, 93 S.Ct. 2041; <i>Chhien,</i> 266 F.3d at 8.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p32\">\n      <span class=\"num\">32</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant also contends that his <i>Miranda</i> waiver and the post-arrest questioning that followed were beyond constitutional limits. Because this contention rests on the same grounds as his plaint about the supposed invalidity of the vehicular search, we reject it out of hand. Accordingly, we uphold the district court's determination that the post-arrest questioning was neither unduly coercive nor tainted by lack of comprehension.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p33\">\n      <span class=\"num\">33</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">4. <i>Recapitulation.</i> We summarize succinctly. We conclude that the police officer who stopped and questioned the appellant had reasonable suspicion for doing so; that the scope of the stop was within appropriate limits; that by the time the police arrested the appellant, reasonable suspicion had burgeoned into probable cause; and that the appellant knowingly and voluntarily consented both to a search of the van and to post-arrest questioning. Consequently, we hold that the lower court did not err in denying the appellant's motion to suppress.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">B. <i>The Mistrial Motion.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p34\">\n      <span class=\"num\">34</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We turn next to the appellant's assertion that the trial judge erroneously denied his motion for a mistrial. We review the denial of a mistrial motion for abuse of discretion. <i>United States v. Torres,</i> 162 F.3d 6, 12 (1st Cir.1998); <i>United States v. Pierro,</i> 32 F.3d 611, 617 (1st Cir.1994).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p35\">\n      <span class=\"num\">35</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The pertinent facts are not disputed. The district court had sustained the appellant's objection to the admission of any evidence of the discovery of a Taser stun gun in the van. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403 (authorizing the court to exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by its unfairly prejudicial effect). One of the police officers nevertheless let slip a mention of the gun during his trial testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant objected and sought a mistrial. The district court struck the offending portion of the answer and gave the jury an emphatic curative instruction: \"The stun gun has nothing to do with this case.... So you should not infer that there is anything improper about the presence of the stun gun there because there wasn't, and you should not consider it in your deliberations because it had nothing to do with this case.\" Having taken these prophylactic measures, the court refused to declare a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant assigns error to this ruling, asserting that no instruction could cure the prejudice inherent in the mere mention of the stun gun. In his view, that reference, in conjunction with Joy's testimony about the appellant's alleged attempt to flee, inevitably would have led the jury to believe that the appellant harbored a propensity for violence. The district court rejected this hypothesis. So do we.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p38\">\n      <span class=\"num\">38</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">When a witness strays into forbidden territory, the usual remedy is to strike the wayward remark and instruct the jury to disregard it. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Bradshaw,</i> 281 F.3d 278, 284 (1st Cir. 2002); <i>Pierro,</i> 32 F.3d at 617. In all but the rare case, that remedy, if properly executed, will suffice to safeguard the aggrieved party's rights. Perscrutation of the record persuades us that this case falls within the general rule, not within the long-odds exception to it. Four factors heavily influence our judgment.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p39\">\n      <span class=\"num\">39</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">First, the witness's allusion to the stun gun, taken in context, was rather innocuous. Second, the lower court supportably found that the comment was inadvertent. Third, the court's response was swift and pointed. It struck the offending reference and gave a blunt curative instruction on the spot. The appellant did not fault the wording of the instruction at the time and does not do so now. Finally, there is a strong presumption that jurors will follow clear instructions from the presiding judge. <i>See Torres,</i> 162 F.3d at 12; <i>United States v. Sepulveda,</i> 15 F.3d 1161, 1185 (1st Cir.1993). The record provides us with no basis for doubting that the jury did so here.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p40\">\n      <span class=\"num\">40</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In sum, the mention of the stun gun was an isolated incident, and the trial judge &#8212; who saw and heard the witness's <i>lapsus linguae</i> at first hand and had an opportunity to evaluate the jury's reaction &#8212; concluded that the slip was not particularly consequential. Considering the whole of the record, this conclusion seems eminently reasonable. Apart from sheer speculation, there is nothing to suggest that the unfortunate allusion to the stun gun irretrievably poisoned the well. We hold, therefore, that the district court's decision to eschew a mistrial was well within the encincture of its discretion.</p>\n    </div>\n    <p class=\"center\">C. <i>The Alleged Instructional Error.</i></p>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p41\">\n      <span class=\"num\">41</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant's remaining claim relates solely to his conviction on count 2 of the indictment. To prove a violation of the statute of conviction, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(3), the government must show that a defendant \"knowingly and with intent to defraud possesse[d] fifteen or more... counterfeit or unauthorized access devices.\" In this case, the appellant asked the district court to instruct the jurors that they had to agree on which fifteen devices (i.e., credit cards) were in his possession. The court refused to do so (although it did grant the appellant's request for a supplemental instruction that required jury unanimity as to which cards were unauthorized). The appellant interposed a timely objection, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 30(d), and now assigns error to the trial court's refusal of the desired instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party's entitlement to a unanimity instruction presents a question of law. Consequently, the district court's answer to that question engenders de novo review. <i>United States v. Pitrone,</i> 115 F.3d 1, 4 (1st Cir.1997).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p43\">\n      <span class=\"num\">43</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The requirement that a federal jury be unanimous is a bedrock principle of our criminal jurisprudence. <i>See Richardson v. United States,</i> 526 U.S. 813, 817, 119 S.Ct. 1707, 143 L.Ed.2d 985 (1999); <i>Schad v. Arizona,</i> 501 U.S. 624, 634 n. 5, 111 S.Ct. 2491, 115 L.Ed.2d 555 (1991); <i>see generally United States v. Correa-Ventura,</i> 6 F.3d 1070, 1076-82 (5th Cir.1993) (providing an extensive discussion of the unanimity requirement). The principle is rooted in the Due Process Clause, U.S. Const. amend. V, and memorialized in Fed. R.Crim.P. 31(a).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p44\">\n      <span class=\"num\">44</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The unanimity requirement does not impose a rule that all twelve jurors in a federal criminal case must agree on every last detail. Sovereigns define crimes by enumerating their factual elements, and the unanimity requirement attaches to those elements. <i>See Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 817, 119 S.Ct. 1707; <i>Johnson v. Louisiana,</i> 406 U.S. 366, 369-71, 92 S.Ct. 1635, 32 L.Ed.2d 162 (1972) (Powell, J., concurring). To that extent &#8212; and only to that extent &#8212; unanimity is an indispensable condition precedent to a conviction. As Justice Blackmun once wrote, \"different jurors may be persuaded by different pieces of evidence, even when they agree upon the bottom line. Plainly there is no general requirement that the jury reach agreement on the preliminary factual issues which underlie the verdict.\" <i>McKoy v. N. Carolina,</i> 494 U.S. 433, 449, 110 S.Ct. 1227, 108 L.Ed.2d 369 (1990) (Blackmun, J., concurring). Thus, if a jury is confronted with divergent factual theories in support of the same ultimate issue, courts generally have held that the unanimity requirement is met as long as the jurors are in agreement on the ultimate issue (even though they may not be unanimous as to the precise theory). <i>See Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 817, 119 S.Ct. 1707; <i>Schad,</i> 501 U.S. at 631-32, 111 S.Ct. 2491; <i>United States v. Hernandez-Albino,</i> 177 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir.1999).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p45\">\n      <span class=\"num\">45</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At this level of generality, the unanimity requirement serves several salutary purposes. For one thing, it helps to ensure that no defendant will be convicted unless the government has carried its burden of proving guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. <i>See Correa-Ventura,</i> 6 F.3d at 1076-77. For another thing, it functions as a corollary of due process rules against duplicity. <i>See United States v. Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d 294, 297 (1st Cir.1999). Finally, it serves to protect defendants against the vagueness and imprecision that haunt some criminal statutes. <i>See Schad,</i> 501 U.S. at 632-33, 111 S.Ct. 2491; <i>United States v. Edmonds,</i> 80 F.3d 810, 819 (3d Cir.1996).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p46\">\n      <span class=\"num\">46</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Withal, the unanimity requirement is more easily stated than applied. The question is one of degree &#8212; and the devil is in the details. Due process demands that a jury must come to agreement on the principal facts underlying its verdict &#8212; what courts have tended to call the elements of the offense. But that requirement does not extend to subsidiary facts &#8212; what the <i>Richardson</i> Court has called \"brute facts.\" <i>Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 817-18, 119 S.Ct. 1707; <i>accord Schad,</i> 501 U.S. at 632, 111 S.Ct. 2491. There is no well defined roadmap to follow in separating the wheat (the elements of an offense) from the chaff (the brute facts that constitute those elements). Rather, we must navigate this course by using guideposts that emanate from \"a distillate of the concept of due process with its demands for fundamental fairness.\" <i>Schad,</i> 501 U.S. at 637, 111 S.Ct. 2491.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p47\">\n      <span class=\"num\">47</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">It is thus apparent that, to resolve this dilemma, an inquiring court must distinguish the elements of a charged offense from the brute facts that constitute those elements, mindful that the unanimity requirement attaches only to the former and not to the latter. <i>Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 817-18, 119 S.Ct. 1707. This taxonomy has important ramifications for the criminal justice system. On the one hand, requiring unanimity on relatively minor details will hamstring the government's ability to prosecute crimes and encourage hung juries. On the other hand, leaving jurors free to convict despite disagreements about critical facts will imperil the integrity of the reasonable doubt standard.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p48\">\n      <span class=\"num\">48</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Against this backdrop, we return to the case at hand. Here, the district court gave a general instruction on unanimity. It required the jury, in effect, to agree that the appellant possessed fifteen or more unauthorized credit cards without requiring agreement as to the identity of those fifteen cards. The pivotal question, therefore, is whether the unanimity requirement extends to which fifteen credit cards the appellant possessed. The answer to this question depends on whether the identity of the credit cards that the appellant possessed is a fact strictly necessary to define the conduct prohibited under the statute of conviction. <i>See Schad,</i> 501 U.S. at 630-31, 111 S.Ct. 2491; <i>United States v. Jackson,</i> 879 F.2d 85, 88-89 (3d Cir.1989). In other words, is the identity of the particular fifteen credit cards an element of the offense or merely a fact used to prove an element?<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fn4_ref\">4</a></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p49\">\n      <span class=\"num\">49</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Ascertainment of the level at which unanimity is required in order to convict a defendant of a particular crime tends to be offense-specific. <i>See Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 817-18, 119 S.Ct. 1707; <i>Correa-Ventura,</i> 6 F.3d at 1081. Thus, a determination of the extent to which jury unanimity is required begins &#8212; and sometimes ends &#8212; with the text of the statute of conviction. <i>See Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 818, 119 S.Ct. 1707. Where, as here, the text does not furnish decisive guidance, an inquiring court must comb the statutory language for clues, consider relevant legal traditions, look at the overall structure of the law, examine the statute's legislative history, and mull the implications for unfairness (if any) associated with the absence of a specific unanimity requirement. <i>See id.</i> at 819-20, 119 S.Ct. 1707; <i>Schad,</i> 501 U.S. at 637-38, 111 S.Ct. 2491.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p50\">\n      <span class=\"num\">50</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The preeminent clues that infiltrate the language of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(3) are derived from the statute's narrow compass and its relative specificity. The statute identifies facts necessary to ground a conviction &#8212; possession of fifteen or more counterfeit or unauthorized access devices &#8212; with considerable precision and channels jury deliberations within well delineated confines. These features distinguish section 1029(a)(3) from 21 U.S.C. &#167; 848 (the statute at issue in <i>Richardson</i>). The latter statute criminalizes the conduct of a continuing criminal enterprise (CCE) and, in so doing, uses as a jumping-off point the commission of any series of included felonies (out of numerous possible choices).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Richardson</i> Court found that the broad and non-specific nature of section 848 &#8212; a statute that lists approximately ninety numbered sections of the federal criminal code as potential serial offenses &#8212; engenders an unacceptable risk of juror disagreement as to which series of violations a defendant actually had committed. 526 U.S. at 819, 119 S.Ct. 1707. This risk is magnified because the statute fails to channel jury deliberations toward a specific set of circumstances, thus creating a danger that a jury might convict a defendant unfairly on the basis of his bad reputation alone. <i>Id.</i> To allay these risks, the Court imposed a requirement of jury unanimity as to which continuing series of violations a defendant actually committed. <i>Id.</i> at 824.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1029(a)(3) does not pose either the same type or degree of risk. While the CCE statute is broad and non-specific, section 1029(a)(3) is narrow and specific. Its precise account of the facts necessary to ground a conviction means that jurors, even without a particularized unanimity instruction, are hardly likely to convict if they cannot reach agreement as to the principal factual elements referable to a given charge. <i>See McKoy,</i> 494 U.S. at 449 n. 5, 110 S.Ct. 1227 (Blackmun, J., concurring) (collecting cases); <i>cf. Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d at 301 (suggesting that when the issue is possession <i>vel non</i> of a specific type of contraband, the potential for juror disagreement is mitigated). Moreover, section 1029(a)(3), unlike the CCE statute, channels jury deliberations toward a particular set of circumstances. A jury dealing with such a statute is unlikely to convict out of a belief that the defendant was doing some non-specific (but obviously bad) act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">History and tradition also help to distinguish section 1029(a)(3) from the CCE statute. The term \"violation,\" used in the CCE statute, always has had independent legal significance; thus, whether certain conduct amounts to a violation is a matter that typically requires jury unanimity. <i>See Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 818-19, 119 S.Ct. 1707; <i>Edmonds,</i> 80 F.3d at 822. In contrast, the phrase \"fifteen or more,\" used in section 1029(a)(3), has no independent legal significance. That phrase simply refers to the nature of the proscribed possession. Consequently, it evokes no similar tradition of jury unanimity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these respects, section 1029(a)(3) is very different from the CCE statute. The more apt comparison is between section 1029(a)(3) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) (the statute at issue in <i>Verrecchia</i>). Section 922(g)(1) criminalizes the possession of \"any firearm\" by a previously convicted felon. <i>Id.</i> The district court failed to give an instruction requiring jury unanimity as to which firearm the defendant allegedly possessed. <i>Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d at 296-97. On plain error review we approved this omission, reasoning that jurors who agreed that the defendant possessed a firearm but disagreed as to which firearm he possessed nonetheless would be unanimous on the relevant element of the offense: possession of \"any firearm.\" <i>Id.</i> at 299. So it is here. Jurors who agreed that the appellant possessed fifteen unauthorized credit cards but disagreed as to which fifteen nonetheless would be unanimous on the relevant element of the offense: possession of \"fifteen or more ... devices.\" The use of non-specific terms such as \"any\" or \"or more\" indicates that Congress's emphasis was not on the identity of the actual items (whether firearms or credit cards), but, rather, on the possession thereof. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An examination of the structure of section 1029 fortifies our belief that the identity of the particular credit cards should not be deemed an element of the offense. That global view leaves a clear impression that Congress intended to target fraudulent access crimes of a particular scope, such as those surpassing certain value thresholds, <i>see, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(5) (criminalizing the knowing use of one or more access devices, with intent to defraud, in order to receive more than $1,000 in a one-year period), or those involving technologies fraudulently used to produce or verify access devices, <i>see, e.g., id.</i> &#167; 1029(a)(4) (criminalizing the possession, production, or use of device-making equipment). The graduated penalty provisions of section 1029, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 1029(c), also are consistent with a focus on the scope of the fraudulent conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This emphasis on scope indicates that Congress most likely regarded the number of unauthorized credit cards &#8212; \"fifteen or more\" &#8212; rather than their identity as the relevant element of the offense. <i>Cf. Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d at 299-300 (requiring no unanimity as to which firearm defendant possessed because the statutory focus lies elsewhere).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The strength of this conclusion is not attenuated by the fact that Congress sought to link culpability to both the nature and number of associated devices through extensive definitions as to what constitutes counterfeit or unauthorized devices. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(e)(1)-(3). The statute provides no detail as to how these devices must be possessed. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1029(e). By the same token, it does not otherwise supply a reason why a jury should be required to agree on exactly which fifteen cards a defendant possessed. These are strong indications that the identity of the credit cards was not meant to be an element of the offense. <i>See Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d at 300-01 (undertaking the same type of analysis, and reaching the same conclusion, with respect to the felon-in-possession statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history of section 1029(a) further buttresses our intuition that section 1029 focuses on the scope of the crime of possession as a whole, as opposed to focusing on each act of possession comprised within that whole. Enacted to augment the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1644, and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1693n(b), in combating increasingly sophisticated types of fraudulent practices, section 1029 expanded the armamentarium available to federal law enforcement authorities by criminalizing the mere possession of counterfeit or unauthorized access devices. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 98-894, at 5 (1984), <i>reprinted in</i> 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3691; <i>see also</i> Theresa L. Kruk, Annotation, <i>What Constitutes Violation of 18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1029, Prohibiting Fraud or Related Activity in Connection with Credit Card or Other Credit Access Device,</i> 115 A.L.R. Fed. 213, 1993 WL 837851 (1993). Congress incorporated the \"fifteen or more\" minimum and the $1,000 monetary threshold as jurisdictional elements, presumably in order to ensure that the weight of the federal government would be brought to bear on more sophisticated and largerscale fraudulent schemes (where federal resources can best supplement state and local law enforcement efforts). <i>See</i> H.R. Rep. 98-894, <i>supra,</i> at 5, <i>reprinted in</i> 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3691. These factors suggest that the identity of the particular \"fifteen or more\" credit cards is not an element of the offense described in section 1029(a)(3), but, rather, encompasses brute facts incident to that offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an endeavor to refute this suggestion, the appellant refers us to a line of cases holding that access devices possessed over different periods of time cannot be aggregated to meet the numerical requirement of section 1029(a)(3). <i>See, e.g., United States v. Powell,</i> 973 F.2d 885, 890 (10th Cir.1992); <i>United States v. Russell,</i> 908 F.2d 405, 406-07 (8th Cir.1990). Far from subverting our conclusion, these decisions simply illustrate that the phrase \"fifteen or more ... devices\" defines the scope of a single crime; given the indications we have noted, that phrase cannot coherently be read as an attempt to aggregate separate crimes. Thus, <i>Powell</i> and <i>Russell</i> confirm a part of our basic premise: the statute of conviction targets crimes of a certain scope. In other words, the crime defined by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(3) is not fifteen acts of possessing an unauthorized credit card, but, rather, a single act of possession of fifteen such devices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A comparison of section 1029(a)(3) with other statutes of similar structure bolsters this conclusion. Typically, statutory elements that require a jury to find a specific quantity of a substance or thing do not demand unanimity as to which items make up that quantity. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Kayode,</i> 254 F.3d 204, 214 (D.C.Cir.2001) (refusing to require unanimity, in a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1028(a)(3), as to which five or more identification documents a defendant possessed); <i>United States v. Nicolaou,</i> 180 F.3d 565, 571-72 (4th Cir.1999) (refusing to require unanimity, in a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1955(b)(1)(ii), as to which five or more persons participated in an illegal gambling business). Indeed, <i>Richardson</i> helps to prove this point. Although the Court demanded unanimity as to which predicate offenses the defendant committed, it suggested that, as to a different aspect of the CCE statute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 848(c)(2)(A), unanimity might not be required as to which \"five or more other persons\" the defendant supervised. <i>See Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 824, 119 S.Ct. 1707. In this regard, the Court noted that the language, breadth, and tradition of the two factual requirements differed significantly. <i>See id.; see also id.</i> at 829, 119 S.Ct. 1707 (Kennedy, J., dissenting); <i>United States v. Tarvers,</i> 833 F.2d 1068, 1074-75 (1st Cir.1987) (holding expressly that, in a prosecution under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 848, unanimity is not required as to the identity of the persons supervised).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that potential juror disagreement on the identity of the credit cards possessed does not risk serious unfairness in contravention of a defendant's constitutional rights. As the structure and legislative history of section 1029 evince, the statute targets fraudulent ventures of a certain size and scope. This emphasis might, in some circumstances, increase the chance of an unfair conviction in the absence of a specific unanimity requirement. <i>See Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 819, 119 S.Ct. 1707; <i>Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d at 301. Here, however, the statute's language is very precise as to the factual basis of the proscribed conduct. This precision, in turn, commands consensus on a number of important facts directly linked to the culpability of a defendant's conduct. That feature significantly mitigates the risk of substantial jury disagreement. <i>See United States v. Davis,</i> 306 F.3d 398, 414 (6th Cir.2002) (refusing to require unanimity on the means by which a defendant violated the aiding and abetting statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2, because of the statute's \"finite terms\"); <i>Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d at 301 (concluding that the precision of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) reduces the potential for unfairness and, thus, reduces the need for a specific unanimity requirement). Consequently, we do not believe that the absence of a unanimity instruction anent the identity of the devices possessed has adverse implications for the fairness of potential convictions under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Having completed our canvass of the appropriate points of reference, we conclude that the identity of the particular devices possessed by a defendant is not an element necessary to prove the culpable act of possession under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(3). Accordingly, that statute does not require a jury, as a condition precedent to conviction, to reach unanimous agreement as to which access devices a defendant possessed. It follows inexorably that the district court did not err in refusing to give the instruction sought by the appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The applicable statutory sections proscribe conduct pertaining to unauthorized or counterfeit access devices<i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(2)-(3), (b)(1).

On appeal, Lee argues that the district court erred in failing to require jury unanimity as to which fifteen credit cards he possessed.

Police officers responded to the shopping plaza where the store was located. They eventually stopped, questioned, and arrested both the appellant and a companion.

On the day of the arrest, Salem police received a report of possible credit card fraud at a Service Merchandise outlet. The store's manager related that a young Asian male had tried (but failed) to purchase a $2,300 wristwatch using not one but two platinum American Express cards ostensibly issued in the name of Zhi Lin. When the attempt failed, both the prospective purchaser and his cohort &#8212; an Asian man wearing a green shirt and lightcolored pants &#8212; departed hurriedly and headed for the parking lot.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p9\">\n      <span class=\"num\">9</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Officer John Joy responded to the call. Arriving on the scene, Joy's attention was drawn to a white van occupied by the appellant and Manchu He. The two men matched the broadcast description of the suspects. Although the van was stopped in the parking lot, the appellant tried to pull it forward when Joy approached. Finding the way obstructed, the appellant then put the van in reverse and shot back (almost running into Joy's police cruiser). Concerned that the men were trying to flee, Joy blocked their path, turned on his blue lights, drew his firearm, and directed his canine companion to bark. When Joy ordered them to step out of the van and show their hands, the men complied. As soon as they did so, Joy re-holstered his weapon and silenced the police dog.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p10\">\n      <span class=\"num\">10</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">At that juncture, four more officers arrived. Joy told the appellant why he had been stopped and assured him that he would be free to go if everything \"turned out.\" He then posed a series of questions to him. At the same time, a second officer began interrogating He. In due course, He gave the officer his wallet and granted him permission to withdraw four pinchbeck cards from within it. When He admitted that the name on the cards &#8212; Zhi Lin &#8212; was not his, the police arrested him.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p11\">\n      <span class=\"num\">11</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Meanwhile, Joy continued to converse with the appellant. When Joy noticed several shopping bags in plain view in the rear of the van, he inquired about them. The appellant confirmed that the merchandise belonged to the two men and gave Joy permission to look for the corresponding receipts. A cursory inspection failed to reveal any receipts, and Joy arrested the appellant for receiving stolen property.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p12\">\n      <span class=\"num\">12</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant thereafter consented to a search of the van and waived his <i>Miranda</i> rights. <i>See Miranda v.

Ed. 2d</span> <span class=\"page\">694</span></a></span> (1966). The search proved fruitful: the police found a cache of fourteen credit cards hidden in two cigarette packs behind the driver's seat (some in the name of Zhi Lin and some in the name of Yun Wu Chen). They also recovered receipts for merchandise purchases totaling approximately $16,000. The receipts correlated with the goods found in the van and with the unauthorized credit cards.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p13\">\n      <span class=\"num\">13</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">That afternoon, an employee of a nearby store found in an adjacent dumpster another four unauthorized credit cards in the name of Yun Wu Chen, together with some identification documents (most of which bore the same name). The employee also reported that an Asian male had entered the store earlier that day but had left after a few minutes of casual conversation.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p14\">\n      <span class=\"num\">14</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant mounts a three-pronged challenge in a concerted effort to suppress the fourteen credit cards, the receipts, the merchandise, and statements that he made to the police. This challenge assails the constitutionality of the investigatory stop, the propriety of his arrest, and the lawfulness of the authorities' post-arrest activities.

In this case, the police officer relied on the information in the store manager's account, together with what he observed in the parking lot, to draw the inference that the appellant and his companion might be involved in the reported credit card fraud. The district court found this reliance reasonable and the inference of involvement logical. We agree. The two men not only were in the right place at the right time but also fit the suspects' descriptions. This collocation of circumstances plainly satisfied the reasonable suspicion standard for an initial <i>Terry</i> stop. <i>See United States v.

These emergent developments amply justified the continued detention. <i>Chhien,</i> 266 F.3d at 9-10; <i>Sowers,</i> 136 F.3d at 27.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p17\">\n      <span class=\"num\">17</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Contrary to the appellant's importunings, this is not a case in which the officers prematurely carried out a de facto arrest. Although there were five officers on the scene, that fact, without more, does not lead inexorably to a conclusion that a de facto arrest occurred. <i>See, e.g., Zapata,</i> 18 F.3d at 975-76; <i>United States v.

The evidence, taken as a whole, adequately supports the district court's finding that, during the interrogation in the parking lot, a reasonable person in the appellant's position would not have understood himself to be in custody. Thus, the investigatory stop did not mutate into the functional equivalent of an arrest. <i>See Berkemer v.

But the stop that transpired here is cut from different cloth. Unlike the suspect in <i>Acosta-Colon, id.</i> at 18-20, the appellant was neither handcuffed nor confined. Moreover, unlike the suspect in <i>Acosta-Colon, id.</i> at 17-18, the appellant was detained and questioned in a public place. These distinctions are critically important in drawing the sometimes elusive line between permissible investigation and impermissible intrusion. <i>See Oregon v.

In all events, actions such as unholstering a weapon and obstructing a vehicle's path do not, as a matter of law, transmogrify an otherwise lawful <i>Terry</i> stop into a de facto arrest. <i>See, e.g., United States v.

The district court could, perhaps, have found the facts differently &#8212; but it is not our proper province either to speculate about whether the police officers' methods might possibly have been more genteel or to second-guess the district court's assessment of the evidence. <i>See United States v.

Probable cause to arrest does not demand either the same quantum of proof or the same degree of certitude as a conviction.

The store manager had reported that two Asian men had entered his establishment in connection with an attempted credit card fraud. The police discovered the appellant in the immediate vicinity of the failed attempt, driving a van that contained a large quantity of expensive, newly acquired merchandise. The man riding with him was found to be in possession of unauthorized credit cards (for which he was arrested). To cinch matters, the two men were not merely near one another but were traveling companions who satisfied the store manager's descriptions and who &#8212; by the appellant's own prearrest admission &#8212; jointly possessed the newly acquired merchandise. Under those circumstances, it strains credulity to think that the appellant was unaware that such a large quantity of goods had been obtained through fraud.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fn2_ref\">2</a> <i>Cf.

Consequently, we uphold the district court's finding that reasonable suspicion ripened into probable cause, thereby supplying a sound constitutional basis for the ensuing arrest. <i>See Velez-Saldana,</i> 252 F.3d at 53; <i>United States v.

In arguing for a contrary conclusion, the appellant points principally to the fact that the police informed him that, if he did not consent to a search of the van, they would simply secure a warrant. Courts have held, with a regularity bordering on the monotonous, that this sort of statement, made in a case in which the facts were sufficient to support the issuance of a search warrant, does not constitute coercion. <i>E.g., Bumper v.

While we appreciate that English is the appellant's second language and that he had the assistance of an interpreter at trial, he has resided in the United States for many years. Perhaps more important, there is nothing in the record to indicate that the appellant was unable to understand Joy's questions, that he had any difficulty in communicating with the officers at the scene (or afterwards for that matter), or that he had any problem comprehending the consent form. These circumstances undermine the credibility of any claim that lack of comprehension led him down a primrose path. <i>See United States v.

The appellant previously had been convicted on other charges (e.g., possession of stolen property).

We conclude that the police officer who stopped and questioned the appellant had reasonable suspicion for doing so; that the scope of the stop was within appropriate limits; that by the time the police arrested the appellant, reasonable suspicion had burgeoned into probable cause; and that the appellant knowingly and voluntarily consented both to a search of the van and to post-arrest questioning.

The district court had sustained the appellant's objection to the admission of any evidence of the discovery of a Taser stun gun in the van. <i>See</i> Fed.R.Evid. 403 (authorizing the court to exclude evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by its unfairly prejudicial effect). One of the police officers nevertheless let slip a mention of the gun during his trial testimony.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p36\">\n      <span class=\"num\">36</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant objected and sought a mistrial. The district court struck the offending portion of the answer and gave the jury an emphatic curative instruction: \"The stun gun has nothing to do with this case.... So you should not infer that there is anything improper about the presence of the stun gun there because there wasn't, and you should not consider it in your deliberations because it had nothing to do with this case.\" Having taken these prophylactic measures, the court refused to declare a mistrial.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p37\">\n      <span class=\"num\">37</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The appellant assigns error to this ruling, asserting that no instruction could cure the prejudice inherent in the mere mention of the stun gun. In his view, that reference, in conjunction with Joy's testimony about the appellant's alleged attempt to flee, inevitably would have led the jury to believe that the appellant harbored a propensity for violence.

In all but the rare case, that remedy, if properly executed, will suffice to safeguard the aggrieved party's rights. Perscrutation of the record persuades us that this case falls within the general rule, not within the long-odds exception to it.

Second, the lower court supportably found that the comment was inadvertent. Third, the court's response was swift and pointed. It struck the offending reference and gave a blunt curative instruction on the spot. The appellant did not fault the wording of the instruction at the time and does not do so now. Finally, there is a strong presumption that jurors will follow clear instructions from the presiding judge. <i>See Torres,</i> 162 F.3d at 12; <i>United States v.

Considering the whole of the record, this conclusion seems eminently reasonable. Apart from sheer speculation, there is nothing to suggest that the unfortunate allusion to the stun gun irretrievably poisoned the well.

The court refused to do so (although it did grant the appellant's request for a supplemental instruction that required jury unanimity as to which cards were unauthorized). The appellant interposed a timely objection, <i>see</i> Fed.R.Crim.P. 30(d), and now assigns error to the trial court's refusal of the desired instruction.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p42\">\n      <span class=\"num\">42</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A party's entitlement to a unanimity instruction presents a question of law.

To that extent &#8212; and only to that extent &#8212; unanimity is an indispensable condition precedent to a conviction.

The question is one of degree &#8212; and the devil is in the details. Due process demands that a jury must come to agreement on the principal facts underlying its verdict &#8212; what courts have tended to call the elements of the offense. But that requirement does not extend to subsidiary facts &#8212; what the <i>Richardson</i> Court has called \"brute facts.\" <i>Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 817-18, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

There is no well defined roadmap to follow in separating the wheat (the elements of an offense) from the chaff (the brute facts that constitute those elements).

On the one hand, requiring unanimity on relatively minor details will hamstring the government's ability to prosecute crimes and encourage hung juries.

Here, the district court gave a general instruction on unanimity. It required the jury, in effect, to agree that the appellant possessed fifteen or more unauthorized credit cards without requiring agreement as to the identity of those fifteen cards. The pivotal question, therefore, is whether the unanimity requirement extends to which fifteen credit cards the appellant possessed. The answer to this question depends on whether the identity of the credit cards that the appellant possessed is a fact strictly necessary to define the conduct prohibited under the statute of conviction. <i>See Schad,</i> 501 U.S. at 630-31, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112637\"><a href=\"/opinion/112637/schad-v-arizona/\"><span class=\"volume\">111</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

The statute identifies facts necessary to ground a conviction &#8212; possession of fifteen or more counterfeit or unauthorized access devices &#8212; with considerable precision and channels jury deliberations within well delineated confines. These features distinguish section 1029(a)(3) from 21 U.S.C. &#167; 848 (the statute at issue in <i>Richardson</i>). The latter statute criminalizes the conduct of a continuing criminal enterprise (CCE) and, in so doing, uses as a jumping-off point the commission of any series of included felonies (out of numerous possible choices).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p51\">\n      <span class=\"num\">51</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The <i>Richardson</i> Court found that the broad and non-specific nature of section 848 &#8212; a statute that lists approximately ninety numbered sections of the federal criminal code as potential serial offenses &#8212; engenders an unacceptable risk of juror disagreement as to which series of violations a defendant actually had committed. 526 U.S. at 819, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1707</span></a></span>. This risk is magnified because the statute fails to channel jury deliberations toward a specific set of circumstances, thus creating a danger that a jury might convict a defendant unfairly on the basis of his bad reputation alone. <i>Id.</i> To allay these risks, the Court imposed a requirement of jury unanimity as to which continuing series of violations a defendant actually committed. <i>Id.</i> at 824.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p52\">\n      <span class=\"num\">52</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Section 1029(a)(3) does not pose either the same type or degree of risk. While the CCE statute is broad and non-specific, section 1029(a)(3) is narrow and specific. Its precise account of the facts necessary to ground a conviction means that jurors, even without a particularized unanimity instruction, are hardly likely to convict if they cannot reach agreement as to the principal factual elements referable to a given charge. <i>See McKoy,</i> 494 U.S. at 449 n. 5, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"112388\"><a href=\"/opinion/112388/mckoy-v-north-carolina/\"><span class=\"volume\">110</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S.

Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d at 301 (suggesting that when the issue is possession <i>vel non</i> of a specific type of contraband, the potential for juror disagreement is mitigated). Moreover, section 1029(a)(3), unlike the CCE statute, channels jury deliberations toward a particular set of circumstances. A jury dealing with such a statute is unlikely to convict out of a belief that the defendant was doing some non-specific (but obviously bad) act.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p53\">\n      <span class=\"num\">53</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">History and tradition also help to distinguish section 1029(a)(3) from the CCE statute. The term \"violation,\" used in the CCE statute, always has had independent legal significance; thus, whether certain conduct amounts to a violation is a matter that typically requires jury unanimity. <i>See Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 818-19, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1707</span></a></span>; <i>Edmonds,</i> 80 F.3d at 822. In contrast, the phrase \"fifteen or more,\" used in section 1029(a)(3), has no independent legal significance. That phrase simply refers to the nature of the proscribed possession. Consequently, it evokes no similar tradition of jury unanimity.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p54\">\n      <span class=\"num\">54</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In these respects, section 1029(a)(3) is very different from the CCE statute. The more apt comparison is between section 1029(a)(3) and 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) (the statute at issue in <i>Verrecchia</i>). Section 922(g)(1) criminalizes the possession of \"any firearm\" by a previously convicted felon. <i>Id.</i> The district court failed to give an instruction requiring jury unanimity as to which firearm the defendant allegedly possessed. <i>Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d at 296-97. On plain error review we approved this omission, reasoning that jurors who agreed that the defendant possessed a firearm but disagreed as to which firearm he possessed nonetheless would be unanimous on the relevant element of the offense: possession of \"any firearm.\" <i>Id.</i> at 299. So it is here. Jurors who agreed that the appellant possessed fifteen unauthorized credit cards but disagreed as to which fifteen nonetheless would be unanimous on the relevant element of the offense: possession of \"fifteen or more ... devices.\" The use of non-specific terms such as \"any\" or \"or more\" indicates that Congress's emphasis was not on the identity of the actual items (whether firearms or credit cards), but, rather, on the possession thereof. <i>See id.</i></p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p55\">\n      <span class=\"num\">55</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">An examination of the structure of section 1029 fortifies our belief that the identity of the particular credit cards should not be deemed an element of the offense. That global view leaves a clear impression that Congress intended to target fraudulent access crimes of a particular scope, such as those surpassing certain value thresholds, <i>see, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(5) (criminalizing the knowing use of one or more access devices, with intent to defraud, in order to receive more than $1,000 in a one-year period), or those involving technologies fraudulently used to produce or verify access devices, <i>see, e.g., id.</i> &#167; 1029(a)(4) (criminalizing the possession, production, or use of device-making equipment). The graduated penalty provisions of section 1029, <i>see id.</i> &#167; 1029(c), also are consistent with a focus on the scope of the fraudulent conduct.<a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fn5_ref\">5</a> This emphasis on scope indicates that Congress most likely regarded the number of unauthorized credit cards &#8212; \"fifteen or more\" &#8212; rather than their identity as the relevant element of the offense. <i>Cf. Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d at 299-300 (requiring no unanimity as to which firearm defendant possessed because the statutory focus lies elsewhere).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p56\">\n      <span class=\"num\">56</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The strength of this conclusion is not attenuated by the fact that Congress sought to link culpability to both the nature and number of associated devices through extensive definitions as to what constitutes counterfeit or unauthorized devices. <i>See, e.g.,</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(e)(1)-(3). The statute provides no detail as to how these devices must be possessed. <i>See id.</i> &#167; 1029(e). By the same token, it does not otherwise supply a reason why a jury should be required to agree on exactly which fifteen cards a defendant possessed. These are strong indications that the identity of the credit cards was not meant to be an element of the offense. <i>See Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d at 300-01 (undertaking the same type of analysis, and reaching the same conclusion, with respect to the felon-in-possession statute).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p57\">\n      <span class=\"num\">57</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">The legislative history of section 1029(a) further buttresses our intuition that section 1029 focuses on the scope of the crime of possession as a whole, as opposed to focusing on each act of possession comprised within that whole. Enacted to augment the Consumer Credit Protection Act, 15 U.S.C. &#167; 1644, and the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, <i>id.</i> &#167; 1693n(b), in combating increasingly sophisticated types of fraudulent practices, section 1029 expanded the armamentarium available to federal law enforcement authorities by criminalizing the mere possession of counterfeit or unauthorized access devices. <i>See</i> H.R.Rep. No. 98-894, at 5 (1984), <i>reprinted in</i> 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. 3182, 3691; <i>see also</i> Theresa L. Kruk, Annotation, <i>What Constitutes Violation of 18 U.S.C.A. &#167; 1029, Prohibiting Fraud or Related Activity in Connection with Credit Card or Other Credit Access Device,</i> 115 A.L.R. Fed. 213, <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">1993</span> <span class=\"reporter\">WL</span> <span class=\"page\">837851</span></span> (1993). Congress incorporated the \"fifteen or more\" minimum and the $1,000 monetary threshold as jurisdictional elements, presumably in order to ensure that the weight of the federal government would be brought to bear on more sophisticated and largerscale fraudulent schemes (where federal resources can best supplement state and local law enforcement efforts). <i>See</i> H.R. Rep. 98-894, <i>supra,</i> at 5, <i>reprinted in</i> 1984 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 3691. These factors suggest that the identity of the particular \"fifteen or more\" credit cards is not an element of the offense described in section 1029(a)(3), but, rather, encompasses brute facts incident to that offense.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p58\">\n      <span class=\"num\">58</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">In an endeavor to refute this suggestion, the appellant refers us to a line of cases holding that access devices possessed over different periods of time cannot be aggregated to meet the numerical requirement of section 1029(a)(3). <i>See, e.g., United States v. Powell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"589796\"><a href=\"/opinion/589796/united-states-v-stanley-douglas-powell/\"><span class=\"volume\">973</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">885</span></a></span>, 890 (10th Cir.1992); <i>United States v. Russell,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"544725\"><a href=\"/opinion/544725/united-states-v-ricky-russell/\"><span class=\"volume\">908</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">405</span></a></span>, 406-07 (8th Cir.1990). Far from subverting our conclusion, these decisions simply illustrate that the phrase \"fifteen or more ... devices\" defines the scope of a single crime; given the indications we have noted, that phrase cannot coherently be read as an attempt to aggregate separate crimes. Thus, <i>Powell</i> and <i>Russell</i> confirm a part of our basic premise: the statute of conviction targets crimes of a certain scope. In other words, the crime defined by 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(3) is not fifteen acts of possessing an unauthorized credit card, but, rather, a single act of possession of fifteen such devices.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p59\">\n      <span class=\"num\">59</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">A comparison of section 1029(a)(3) with other statutes of similar structure bolsters this conclusion. Typically, statutory elements that require a jury to find a specific quantity of a substance or thing do not demand unanimity as to which items make up that quantity. <i>See, e.g., United States v. Kayode,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"185416\"><a href=\"/opinion/185416/united-states-v-kayode-olanike/\"><span class=\"volume\">254</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">204</span></a></span>, 214 (D.C.Cir.2001) (refusing to require unanimity, in a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1028(a)(3), as to which five or more identification documents a defendant possessed); <i>United States v. Nicolaou,</i> <span class=\"citation no-link\"><span class=\"volume\">180</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">565</span></span>, 571-72 (4th Cir.1999) (refusing to require unanimity, in a prosecution under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1955(b)(1)(ii), as to which five or more persons participated in an illegal gambling business). Indeed, <i>Richardson</i> helps to prove this point. Although the Court demanded unanimity as to which predicate offenses the defendant committed, it suggested that, as to a different aspect of the CCE statute, 21 U.S.C. &#167; 848(c)(2)(A), unanimity might not be required as to which \"five or more other persons\" the defendant supervised. <i>See Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 824, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1707</span></a></span>. In this regard, the Court noted that the language, breadth, and tradition of the two factual requirements differed significantly. <i>See id.; see also id.</i> at 829, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1707</span></a></span> (Kennedy, J., dissenting); <i>United States v. Tarvers,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"497957\"><a href=\"/opinion/497957/united-states-v-anthony-phillip-tarvers-jr-united-states-of-america-v/\"><span class=\"volume\">833</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.2d</span> <span class=\"page\">1068</span></a></span>, 1074-75 (1st Cir.1987) (holding expressly that, in a prosecution under 21 U.S.C. &#167; 848, unanimity is not required as to the identity of the persons supervised).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p60\">\n      <span class=\"num\">60</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">Finally, we note that potential juror disagreement on the identity of the credit cards possessed does not risk serious unfairness in contravention of a defendant's constitutional rights. As the structure and legislative history of section 1029 evince, the statute targets fraudulent ventures of a certain size and scope. This emphasis might, in some circumstances, increase the chance of an unfair conviction in the absence of a specific unanimity requirement. <i>See Richardson,</i> 526 U.S. at 819, <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"118295\"><a href=\"/opinion/118295/richardson-v-united-states/\"><span class=\"volume\">119</span> <span class=\"reporter\">S. Ct.</span> <span class=\"page\">1707</span></a></span>; <i>Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d at 301. Here, however, the statute's language is very precise as to the factual basis of the proscribed conduct. This precision, in turn, commands consensus on a number of important facts directly linked to the culpability of a defendant's conduct. That feature significantly mitigates the risk of substantial jury disagreement. <i>See United States v. Davis,</i> <span class=\"citation\" data-id=\"779376\"><a href=\"/opinion/779376/united-states-v-david-devon-davis/\"><span class=\"volume\">306</span> <span class=\"reporter\">F.3d</span> <span class=\"page\">398</span></a></span>, 414 (6th Cir.2002) (refusing to require unanimity on the means by which a defendant violated the aiding and abetting statute, 18 U.S.C. &#167; 2, because of the statute's \"finite terms\"); <i>Verrecchia,</i> 196 F.3d at 301 (concluding that the precision of 18 U.S.C. &#167; 922(g)(1) reduces the potential for unfairness and, thus, reduces the need for a specific unanimity requirement). Consequently, we do not believe that the absence of a unanimity instruction anent the identity of the devices possessed has adverse implications for the fairness of potential convictions under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(3).</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p61\">\n      <span class=\"num\">61</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">We need go no further. Having completed our canvass of the appropriate points of reference, we conclude that the identity of the particular devices possessed by a defendant is not an element necessary to prove the culpable act of possession under 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(3). Accordingly, that statute does not require a jury, as a condition precedent to conviction, to reach unanimous agreement as to which access devices a defendant possessed. It follows inexorably that the district court did not err in refusing to give the instruction sought by the appellant.</p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"num\" id=\"p62\">\n      <span class=\"num\">62</span>\n      <p class=\"indent\">\n        <i>Affirmed.</i>\n      </p>\n    </div>\n    <div class=\"footnotes\">\n      <div class=\"footnote\">\n        <p>Notes:</p>\n      </div>\n      <div class=\"footnote\" id=\"fn1\">\n        <a class=\"footnote\" href=\"#fn1_ref\">1</a>\n        <p> The applicable statutory sections proscribe conduct pertaining to unauthorized or counterfeit access devices<i>See</i> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1029(a)(2)-(3), (b)(1).

The jury heard evidence about a total of twenty-two bogus credit cards. These included fourteen credit cards found in the van, four retrieved from He's wallet, and four discovered in the dumpster.
